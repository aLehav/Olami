After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Having completed his two-year jail sentence, a strapping and reformed Jackie (Tim C. Moan ’14) finally returns home to his longtime lover and fellow drug user, Veronica (Ema H. Horvath ’16). The couple—central to Stephen A. Guirgis’s “The Motherf**cker with the Hat”—is as loud and crass as the New York City neighborhood that they inhabit and as exhilarating and volatile as their substance-induced highs. But Jackie, now two years sober and a resolute adherent to his AA sponsor, Ralph (Dylan J. Peterson ’17), hopes to settle down with Veronica and chart a new course for their relationship.
Jackie’s return, however, is not the only surprise to face the couple. As Jackie discovers an unfamiliar hat in Veronica’s apartment, the worth of his reformation is cast into doubt when he assumes that she has cheated on him, and the ex-convict sets out to discover the truth about his relationship and find meaning in the world. At its heart “the play addresses the notion that loving someone doesn’t necessarily mean they should be in your life, and just because someone is in your life, that doesn’t mean you must love them,” director Simone E. Polanen ’14 says.
Horvath believes that aside from the entertaining aspects of her character and Jackie’s relationship, there is something substantial beneath their feverish, borderline-abusive, dynamic. “One of my acting teachers once told me that hate is the closest thing to love,” Horvath says. “It’s passionate in a way that most prim and proper relationships can’t be. It is cathartic for me, and I think it’ll be for the audience as well.”
 
But as the presence of Chris Rock in the play’s original cast might suggest, the production’s humor is no less significant than its drama. “I really just try not to think about it. Ralph is a bit of queer guy and says a lot of strange things, which are naturally pretty funny,” Peterson says, the role previously occupied by Rock.
 
Beyond the production’s rich plot and acting, Polanen delights in the play’s technical artistic accomplishments. “The set is pretty exciting,” Polanen says. “It’s comprised of three apartments, which are shown through three different platforms. And the space between the platforms features some graffiti and street art that’s quite colorful and creative.” 
Though the realities of parole, drug addiction, and life in New York City slums may seem distant for many Harvard students, Moan trusts that it should not pose a problem. “The setting is something we may not be used to,” Moan says. “But the emotions…those are common to all of us.”
 “The Motherf**cker with the Hat” will show in the Loeb Experimental Theater from March 7 to 14.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Last month, Washington Governor Jay R. Inslee put an immediate moratorium on executions in his state, one of the 32 that still practice capital punishment. While he is not the first governor to take such an action and his decision is by no means legally binding or permanent, the decision has revived discussion about lethal punishment in the United States.
Too often, the debate around the death penalty centers on whether or not people convicted of crimes deserve to die. However, this is a distracting debate. Neither we the citizens nor the government elected to act on our behalf have the authority to make such a decision. 
Our focus needs to be turned to the fundamental question of whether the state has the right to kill one of its citizens.
In our obsession with Hammurabi-style “eye for an eye” punishments, we have neglected to think about the role that the state and, by extension, the people play in being the enforcers of execution. The death penalty should be discontinued on the grounds that, as a society, we do not have a collective right or need to kill. Capital punishment reflects an inconsistency within a legal system that should seek rehabilitation and deterrence rather than vengeance and retribution.
Our legal and cultural traditions dictate a belief in the absolute importance of life itself. This is expressed in our founding documents, the source of guidance for our most difficult political and moral questions. The Founders recognized certain “truths to be self evident,” including the belief that all human beings are “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,” life being chief among them.
Life is surely something greater than a man-made system that seeks criminal justice. That such a system should have the ability to end life contradicts basic assumptions and values about the responsibility of government with respect to its citizens.
Compared to other aspects of the criminal justice system, capital punishment stands out as irregular and unmoored from a rational basis. In no other situation does our system attempt to punish criminals with the same crime they committed. Thieves, rapists, and arsonists are jailed in an attempt to increase public safety in the short run and to rehabilitate them in the long run. We have come the conclusion that those acts we consider illegal are objectively immoral by reasonable social standards, and as a result we seek their elimination. When it comes to the crime of murder, it appears we have lost the simple yet guiding principle that the end goal should be an overall reduction in killing—not an increase.
If other ethical considerations were to be ignored, society would still have no right to enact the death penalty for another reason: the imprecision with which it is doled and carried out. In the last 40 years, over 130 people have been wrongfully convicted, placed on death row, and finally released upon acquittal and exoneration. While one reading of this statistic acknowledges that the system has been able to correct its own faults, the figure also carries the horrifying possibility that many more wrongful convictions have gone and will go undiscovered. 
Governor Inslee invoked similar logic in his decision to suspend executions, arguing that “there are too many flaws in our system.”
Our system has also failed to fulfill the promise of equal justice under law. Extreme racial disparity exists in the criminal justice system, with disproportionate sentencing reaching unacceptable levels. 
Studies have shown that minority defendants are up to three times as likely to receive the death penalty compared to white defendants. The root of this is varied, ranging from implicit bias in juries and judges to deficient public defense programs that do much of the legal work for minorities in poorer areas. Regardless of the causes, until this disparity can be eliminated, the existence of the death penalty magnifies such flaws in the system, raising the stakes for potentially innocent defendants immensely. The idea that we have a collective right to use capital punishment—that only makes these inequities permanent—ought to be rejected.
For generations, the acceptance of capital punishment has occupied an unquestioned acceptance for America. However, this debate is too often construed to be whether particular criminals deserve deaths. Instead, our attention should be turned to the question of whether our society is in a moral position to kill. An assessment of our historical values as well as the unquestionable presence of a justice system too often defined by error clearly point to an answer: No.

In fall 2013, The Crimson lauded the change in MBTA policy that would expand late-night T service with a one-year pilot program. Harvard students, both at the College and University levels, stand to benefit from increased public transportation options. Now that the MBTA is calling for corporate sponsors in an effort to defray the costs of late-night scheduling, Harvard should become a sponsor in order to support both the needs of its students and the economic climate of Greater Boston.
 
According to MBTA officials, late-night service is expected to cost around $20 million annually, not accounting for offsetting fares or sponsorships. In order to fund even the one-year pilot program, the T recently unveiled a tiered sponsorship system that offers advertising opportunities on transit property in order to help maintain and operate the new late-night option. The “Late Night Sponsorship Program” packages range in cost from $25,000 to $500,000, offering Harvard room to contribute as it can. If the price tag on the $250,000 Gold Sponsorship seems too steep in light of recently rejected UC funding calls, Harvard can still support late night service through the more modest Steel or Copper options. After all, Harvard students will reap some of the largest gains from the new service.
 
Expanded T hours would allow for greater ease of access to Boston and a more vibrant student life, for undergraduate graduate students alike. The T’s current 1 a.m. end time cuts a sharp curfew on the actual hours of weekend nightlife. Students and young people around Boston in part drive the demand for the change, and stand to benefit from late-night mobility. At the graduate schools in particular, students will gain access to the more vibrant urban life of Boston’s bars and restaurants without worrying about the early T curfew. At the College, students will find it easier to step outside the proverbial Harvard “bubble,” confident in the ability to ride the T without getting stuck far from home late at night. And an alternative to hefty cab fares will make Boston more accessible for many Harvard students.
 
Aside from its responsibility to students, Harvard also stands as an integral part of the local community. As such, it should give back and support the local infrastructure. Boston’s economic and social well-being are inextricably tied to Harvard’s metropolitan appeal. As such, Harvard should financially support a service that looks to expand the economic prospects of its community.
 
Facility of transportation is key to a robust nightlife and to an economically thriving city, and improvements in Boston’s infrastructure will spill over into Cambridge. By financially sponsoring a T service that benefits both the community and its students, Harvard would demonstrate its commitment to a necessary and long-awaited change.

James Patterson—bestselling author, savior of literature? Perhaps. Patterson leads Forbes Magazine’s list of the world’s top-earning authors and pledged this February to donate $1 million to the country’s independent bookstores. His words, as reported in the New York Times, were: “Our bookstores in America are at risk. Publishing and publishers as we’ve known them are at stake. To some extent the future of American literature is at stake.”
 
Patterson’s money supports about 50 booksellers nationwide; the profits from the sale of his books alone—51 New York Times Bestsellers among them—most likely dwarf his unprecedented gift. Adding the two figures, I’m sure that few, if any, other writers are as charitable to the vanishing breed of flesh-and-blood booksellers. And in turn, these booksellers are eager to tout the economic benefits of shopping at small and local businesses: IndieBound reminds consumers that of $100 spent locally, $68 remain circulating in the local economy, whereas the same sum spent at a chain store returns only $43 to the local economy. Customers of the Harvard Book Store will recognize this stat—it’s appended to and printed on each receipt.
 
Like most students at Harvard, I appreciate the value of a local bookstore, its artful display of tiles and eruditely curated inventory, the comforting smell of aging paper and the warmth I feel when stepping inside on a winter day. I have fond memories, too, from when I worked at Borders the summer before I came to Harvard. But now, Borders is closed—its URL redirects to its archrival Barnes & Noble—and my shelves are full of books I’ve purchased from Amazon.
 
What kind of traitor am I? I turned my own stomach a little bit after reading George Packer’s reportage-cum-bildungsroman of Amazon in The New Yorker. Suddenly all the deals I’d snagged and the money I’d saved seemed a bit dishonest. A steal!—a new copy of a two-volume Norton anthology for the price of one used volume at the COOP—well, now it did feel like a steal.
 
This is the downside of disruptive innovation. Amazon, an enterprise that was born digital, takes full advantage of what the Harvard Business Review calls the “Big Data Future.” Amazon offers the widest possible selection of books, goods, and services; the more I shop with them, the more they learn about me and what I want (even before I know that I want or need it). Local bookstores might learn my preferences after years of patronage, but their expertise remains book-centered. Chain bookstores seem to have the worst of it: inept utilization of data, impersonal scale, and a high cost of business maintaining hundreds or thousands of retail properties across the entire United States.
 
As a student and consumer, it’s my job to find the lowest price; as a resident of Cambridge, it’s also my job to support the local economy as best I can; and as a lover of literature, I feel a bond of loyalty to the publishers and authors that produce the books, the stories, the poems that have changed my life. That’s three conflicting directions pulling on me—the finale of a sappy reality show in which I must decide if I give a rose to Amazon, the suitor who suits my wallet, or to Harvard Book Store, the one I know best, or to Graywolf Press, the suave one who always says the right things?
 
It’s a choice between approaches, between enterprises that focus either on you or on books. Amazon, bless its heart, knows all about me but cares nothing about the contents of the books I buy. It won’t tell me that “Pnin” is better than “Lolita” or debate the merits and demerits of translators of Milosz, Szymborska, and Herbert. On the other hand, publishers can be distant—how can they know which book in their catalogue I’m dying to read? It seems, then, that the local bookseller is the middle path between extremes. And though they are declining, they are doing well enough—in 2011 Barnes & Noble held about 17 percent of the US book market while Amazon captured 23 percent of sales. Together, they account for only 40 percent of the market, which is significant but not monolithic—aspiring towards monopoly, yes, but not there yet.
 
Disruptive innovation has its upsides, maybe not for booksellers but certainly for authors. They can share their work widely, quickly, the auspices of fickle publishers, agents, and editors no longer required. (Though, truth be told, literary quality might suffer without that input.) There’s still space to be a thoughtful consumer and reader: Expenses of buying local can be balanced out with occasional one-click-shopping or a trip to the library. There’s cause for cautious optimism—with or without James Patterson.

“In this bright future you can’t forget your past.” –Bob Marley
 
Before I came to Harvard, I thought I could be anyone I wanted. Doctor, astronaut, proud owner of a $2 million yacht, you name it. I had only to try hard enough—earn top grades, be accepted to the right university, and avoid meth and crack (cocaine was a go—rich white people and Obama did it), and I could cross any barriers—reach further than the unwritten limits of my circle of friends and family. That was what my mom told me, and who was I to question the zany woman who gave me life?
 
It was only when I first set foot in Harvard Yard—the first weekend of April senior year (I couldn’t go to Visitas because my high school’s Jello Wrestling competition was the same weekend, and I obviously had to defend my junior year title)—that I began to realize that “anyone I wanted” might be someone I wasn’t; that the recent slew of articles debunking the American Dream as myth and decrying the lack of social and economic mobility in the U.S. might not exclude Harvard.
 
I didn’t know exactly why I felt uncomfortable being myself that first weekend—maybe it was because I was the only pre-frosh, had been lost for three days straight, didn’t have swipe access, and ended up sitting outside my host’s dorm for 20 minutes, waiting to be let in, before Dean Thomas A. Dingman ’67 made an appearance and informed me that the step I was occupying was not, in fact, the entrance to Pennypacker, but rather the Freshman Dean's Office. (You might not remember me, Dean Dingman, but I will always attribute my choosing Harvard to your melodious vocal cords.)
 
And yet there was another formidable moment from that weekend worth mentioning—the moment I asked my host about financial aid. 
I can’t deny that she was helpful, explaining the logistics of the Student Events Fund and all the other free money the school so generously bestows on students. But what I remember most from the conversation was her telling me how easy it was for students to keep their financial aid status secret—how even roommates could be, and often were, kept in the dark. It quickly became obvious that financial aid wasn’t something people talked about.
I was confused. Why would the help that 60 percent of the student body reportedly receives not be a topic of discussion? And how could anyone form close friendships without divulging this kind of personal information?
Back home, money and social class were openly and casually discussed—none of us felt defined by our financial or social status. Yet when I got to Harvard, I began to feel increasingly defined by my background—a background no one on campus really knew about. I began to realize why my former host assured me that my financial aid status would be easy to hide. Because that was exactly what I did. It was as if my pre-Harvard self had become irrelevant.
Except it wasn’t.
During one of my more sentimental moments, I told a friend that I felt like no one at Harvard actually knew me. Rather than plunging into one of those deep, bare-all revelations about his past experiences and insecurities, he gave the Harvard-esque answer I was hoping we’d avoid. He explained that we don’t have to know each other’s pasts, that all we need to know about each other is who we are now. I knew I didn’t agree, but at the time I couldn’t articulate why.
My friend’s argument, in retrospect, rings a little hollow and sounds a whole lot like a white person saying that race is not an issue for her—that it’s safely in the background.
Students from disadvantaged backgrounds may now have a voice here, an institution historically reserved for only the most elite and privileged, but that doesn’t mean they always feel comfortable being heard.
When we get here, we join clubs that fit our interests. We talk about race in Kuumba or Fuerza Latina. Or about being from Texas in the Texas Club. When people that are similar to us surround us, sharing is comfortable and easy. But while it’s vital to have these spaces to feel safe on campus, learning and growing rarely involve being comfortable.
Whether it's a black student not talking about her race with her white friends, or a financial aid recipient not talking about her money issues with her upper-class roommates, there is a problem. When social class, race, and all the other the other characteristics that put the “diverse” in diversity are not discussed, changing the unwritten rules becomes impossible.
Maybe it’s time to address the uncomfortable, to get to know not only classmates’ presents but also their pasts. Not only might this break down social barriers and help us achieve some real mobility—if we really take the time and effort to learn about one another, we might even like what we find.

The implications of climate change are increasingly well documented: Rising sea levels, more severe storms, and increased food scarcity are just a few. We have already begun to see the impacts of climate change, and we know that it often affects the world’s most vulnerable populations. We also know that fossil fuel companies hold enough carbon in their proven reserves to push our atmosphere well past the widely recognized “safe” limit for planetary warming (an increase of 2 degrees Celsius). Finally, we know that a portion of Harvard’s endowment is invested in fossil fuel companies, which means that we are part of this destruction—and that we have a chance to do something about it.
 
Harvard’s President Drew G. Faust continues to reject student, faculty, and alumni calls to divest our endowment from fossil fuel extraction companies. President Faust’s justification for this rejection is nothing new. It is the same set of arguments that Harvard’s administration made in the 1970s and ’80s in response to student pressure to divest from companies that supported the South African apartheid regime.  
  
In 1984, then-Harvard President Derek C. Bok claimed there was “no realistic possibility” that the university’s divestment from companies supporting apartheid would contribute to ending apartheid. He was wrong. Though Harvard achieved only partial divestment from companies supporting apartheid, the move was part of a wider, effective campaign to end apartheid. In fact, according to Nelson Mandela, the University of California’s divestment was a turning point in abolishing apartheid.
 
Faust now tells us that, contrary to this precedent, divestment would have no effect on fossil fuel companies. Denying our ability to have an impact on climate change does a disservice to student activism and poses a danger to the world. It is also incorrect: A recent study from researchers at Oxford University found that divestment campaigns can have a serious impact on the fossil fuel industry, as they stigmatize companies and take away their political legitimacy.
 
Faust, like Bok before her, denies these effects and recommends an ineffective alternative to divestment. In 1984, Bok suggested that instead of divesting, Harvard should encourage change by voting on shareholder resolutions and engaging in a dialogue with corporate executives. Students and other activists met the idea with criticism, but now Faust is using her predecessor’s failed argument to portray shareholder advocacy as an alternative to divestment. By investing in fossil fuel companies, the argument goes, we gain a platform to encourage change within the industry. There are two problems with this approach. First, Harvard simply hasn’t done enough to pursue it. For example, the Harvard Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility has voted against the establishment of a committee that would make recommendations on how Exxon Mobil can become an environmentally sustainable corporation. Second, it doesn’t work: The change required of fossil fuel companies is too fundamental for shareholder pressure to be effective, and the timeline is too short.
 
Faust also continues to perpetuate the same myth Bok embraced—that Harvard’s investments are politically neutral. In 1984, President Bok argued that Harvard should not divest from companies doing business in South Africa because “universities should not attempt to use their political and economic views on other organizations and individuals beyond the campus.” The current administration similarly claims to resist divestment for fear that it would cause Harvard to be perceived as a political actor.
 
This ignores the fact that investment, like divestment, is a political position. Profiting from climate wreckage is not neutral. By investing in companies whose purpose is fossil fuel extraction, we are endorsing that activity. In fact, Harvard does recognize this premise: It’s the reason we’ve divested in the past. In addition to South African apartheid, Harvard has also divested from tobacco companies and companies linked to genocide in Darfur. In fact, it seems even Bok came to recognize divestment as an appropriate response: In addition to achieving partial divestment from South Africa, he led Harvard to divest from tobacco companies for moral reasons, describing the decision to divest from tobacco companies as “motivated by a desire not to be associated as a shareholder with companies engaged in significant sales of products that create a substantial and unjustified risk of harm to other human beings.”
 
Climate change does precisely this, and on a massive scale: It is wrecking the planet, threatening our future, and causing great harm to many people. Nine colleges have already committed to divest from fossil fuels, along with many cities, counties, religious organizations, and other institutions. Harvard has an opportunity to lead the way and a responsibility to take action. We should recognize this responsibility and divest now.

Once a month, a group of ten to 20 people push the shelves in the left room of the Harvard Book Store to make space for their discussion. They’ve just finished reading a book for the month’s meeting. The regulars exchange glances as they look around at the new faces.
The usual suspects gather: the reader who does not like anything on the list but comes anyway, the plot-obsessed reader probing the buttresses of the work, the classics-lover who points at every allusion to Shakespeare that failed, the reader who lectures on one element of the book on which he is an expert, and the reader who did not do the reading but watched the movie. Some readers are in their twenties, some of them are past the midcentury line.
The members of the Harvard Square Book Circle are ready to begin.
Rachel B. Cass, head buyer at Harvard Book Store, has been involved with the Book Circle since its conception in 2008. She leads the monthly meetings and suggests books for the group to read, sometimes polling the regulars over the group email list. The readings vary in time and genre. Past picks have included University Professor Stephen J. Greenblatt’s “The Swerve,” Junot Diaz’s “This is How You Lose Her,” and Jane Austen’s “Sense and Sensibility.”
Cass starts the meetings with introductions and first impressions; she does not have any trouble sparking a conversation. “Cambridge people want to express their opinions,” she says. “The best discussions take place when readers disagree.”
She tells me that their last meeting witnessed a heated debate about Ron Rash’s “Serena,” as some readers hated the book. According to Cass, this is one of the special things about the Book Circle: It’s never certain who is going to take which side. In Cass’s experience, she says, she tends to like the book more after the Book Circle has met.
In the Book Circle, acquaintance and shared interest provide a common ground to engage in the conversation with sincerity and enthusiasm, while the readers’ lack of intimacy discourages them from passing rash judgment on each other’s opinions.
“We end up having a lot of questions,” Cass says. Often, phones come out in an attempt to clear up confusion with some Googling.
“For one thing, I am in no way an expert,” Cass confesses. Nobody is. Harvard Square Book Circle is not section. This is a joint effort to tackle a work together, outside the realm of scholarship.
Cass recounts her joy when she spotted a regular at local bakery-café Panera Bread, reading the next month’s book. She says that some members get together outside the club as well.
Our conversation moves on from the dynamics of the Book Circle to books themselves. Novels are easily the forerunners as books that prompt the deepest conversations, she says. With short story collections people have conflicting interests, as they want to discuss different stories. Sometimes nonfiction works well, Cass adds. She says one of the most attended meetings was the discussion of Charles Darwin’s “On the Origin of Species.”
There have been, however, meetings where discussions died before the gong of the hour. One such occasion, several years ago, was when they read Terry Tempest Williams’s “Finding Beauty in a Broken World.” The readers were challenged by descriptions of the activities of prairie dogs that went on for pages and therefore could not connect with the work, she says. The Book Circle, Cass tells me, favors narratives with overarching themes or trajectories.
Finally, along with oration and literary camaraderie, the Book Circle includes the offer of Cass’s homemade cookies.
I tell her the Circle meets all the criteria to get funding from the College. Not only do they engage in an intellectual enterprise, but they also serve cookies. If they up their game on exclusivity and enforce a comp process, Harvard Square Book Circle can easily make it to the extracurricular scene on campus.
Many nights of the week, I depart from the Yard to find my way back to my room in the dark. While crossing Mass. Ave., especially when the weather is cold, as it most often is around here, SI am tempted to take a right to fuel up with a warm cup of coffee at Starbucks. But the soft lights of the black shop on the left capture my eye, and I am lured to the Harvard Book Store. Next time I happen to walk by, I will be sure to scan the windows to see what the Harvard Square Book Circle is reading.

6:32 p.m. My entryway mate, who’s in the show, comes through the hallway, sees the ticket line, and breathes, “Oh, shit. Oh, shit.” A girl in a blue and gold sari follows. Another student next to her holds what appears to be a silver-sequined crop top in his hand.
6:51 p.m. In the theater, I snag a seat as close to front and center as possible and head to the bathroom. Six performers are crowded around the sinks, putting on eyeliner and fixing their hair. One girl has on the sequined crop top I saw earlier. The others, in saris, appear as streaks of pink, gold, and green in the mirror.
7:15 p.m. The doors of the at-capacity theater close. The lights dim, and a bright, big projection of a cursive “Ghungroo” flashes on the curtains.
This is Ghungroo 2014, the South Asian Association’s 25th annual cultural production. It’s never been bigger—more than 400 students are involved. Ghungroo is in a class all of its own.
The ensuing three hours can only be described as wildly colorful. The show features the brightest visual display I’ve ever laid my eyes on: a vivid street backdrop, with orange and purple stores labeled “Bombay Sweets” and “Deepika’s Dhaba.” There are saris and tunics in every color imaginable, many adorned with silver or gold stitching. The dance pieces are enormous, the skits are silly and provocative, and the music is loud, with beats that make me want to get up on stage.
Yes, the show is cultural; the performers wear costumes, sing in Hindi, and employ traditional dance moves. But it’s more a marriage of East and West, an attention-grabbing spectacle that melds tradition and modernity. Ghungroo is what the narrator describes as “chicken tikka masala—not quite purely found in South Asia, but a sumptuous meal that leaves you ready for more.”
Number after number, hordes of smiling students run on and off the stage, fusing classic Indian dance moves with stuff you’d see in a Robin Thicke music video (hip thrusts and “roll the dice” hand motions). Interspersed are showcases of musical talent (a capella, rap, and indie-type acoustic, all weaving in some Hindi) and skits that poke fun at Indian stereotypes. One scene is reminiscent of “Mean Girls,” another of “Meet the Parents.”
Several minutes in, I realize that we—the audience members—are an integral, energetic element of the performance. People start imitating the “click” sound that occurs every time the narrator turns off her microphone, and someone shouts, “That’s my blockmate!” during a dance. I’m not South Asian, and I only know a few of the performers and audience members, but I’ve soon become part of this terrifically genial community.
I should’ve guessed that the show would be big, loud, and interactive with all the family members and alumni in the audience. But did I expect to laugh out loud? Squirm in my seat? Catcall the dancers? Who could have anticipated that the line “Do you have a favorite type of curry?” would be so funny? Or that students would Beyoncé booty-shake to Indian pop? Prior to 7:15 p.m., I had no idea what I was getting myself into. But I’m glad I was part of it.
The last number, the notorious senior dance, spans something like 15 minutes. Students appear in an endless stream from backstage. I vaguely wonder how they fit that many people behind the Mumbai backdrop, but I let the shiny rainbow of dancing bodies distract me. The audience shouts out names and claps for the entire performance.
10:10 p.m. The curtain finally closes, but the cast is still dancing on stage.
10:15 p.m. I’m back in the Agassiz hallway, which is buzzing with energy. Some of the performers have already made it to their respective audience members. All of them—dancers, singers, mothers, fathers, friends, and blockmates—are beaming.

Nico J. Schwalbe ’14 opens the door of a tiny room in the Lowell basement filled with tangled cords, and I take a seat on an amp by the drumset. This is the rehearsal space for L.A. Jeff, a student band Schwalbe helped found. We are soon joined by Sam J.J. Newmark ’14, who greets me and immediately starts unpacking his guitar.
“Me and Nico met, like, week two of school,” Sam explains. “We spent a lot of time getting high and jamming in his room, which is pretty much the only thing you can fucking do in freshman year.”
It took another musical connection, however, to bring the whole band together—Harvard Radio Broadcasting, or WHRB. Band member Parker M. Crane ’13 met the two freshmen through radio, and the three started making music together.
“We got yelled at in the Co-op for jamming,” Crane recalls. His bandmates laugh, and they launch into a good-natured imitation of someone telling them off for being loud.
L.A. Jeff’s unique name comes from a similarly relaxed day. “We were just sitting around drinking on a Friday afternoon,” recalls Schwalbe. Newmark details the full story, recalling, “Nico was pushing for an acronymic name, and I had various suggestions, one of which was Low Hanging Fruit, LHF, and then someone heard it as L.A. Jeff, and then we started just making up this guy, this craaaazy dude, L.A. Jeff, we had to represent us.” Nico adds, “Sort of like Jeff Lebowski.” The members crack up. “Yeah, like the Big Lebowski!”
L.A. Jeff’s sound is even more distinct than their name. While many campus bands at Harvard take the route of a crowd-pleasing cover-band, L.A. Jeff writes their own music and only performs the occasional cover. The band fuses 1960s elements with each member’s personal quirks and styles for a sound member Saman Rouhani ’14 describes as a “pleasant mess.”
“There’s definitely a self-conscious throwback kind of element; we play a lot of very sixties, psychedelic, garage-influenced things,” says Newmark of their sound. “A lot of that was very much derived from the culture of American youth in the sixties, the teenagers who would just get a guitar for Christmas and want to start a band. A lot of it was also kind of, you know, centered around the drug scene of the sixties, especially, like, the more jam stuff, but it’s developed into its own thing.”
When asked which artists the group relates to the most, Crane pauses before offering, “I was thinking we sound kind of like Brian Jonestown Massacre.” Nico agrees, citing the neo-psychedelic band as a major songwriting influence. Rouhani mentions the Yardbirds, but says of L.A. Jeff, “we’re spreading out more, though.”
The band is not just a sum of its influences: it creates a style of its own in many ways, including aspects as simple as the ratio of instruments. “With three guitars, it’s gonna sound a certain way,” explains Schwalbe.
Newmark cites the triple force of guitarists as adding “a grunge-y element to the sound,” and goes on to explain that “with this number of guitars, it’s very hard to maintain a clean-cut sound.” Members’ personalities and instruments come through in the sound as well. Crane says, “I definitely lean kind of more towards funk as the bassist, but there’s only so much funk you can introduce into something like us.”
Originally called Lunar Volk, L.A. Jeff’s sound evolved along with its former outfit. The addition of Will Sisselle, who responded to the band’s Craigslist ad for a new drummer this past fall, turned the quartet into a five-piece, giving them the opportunity to explore a new sound as their current drummer became another guitarist. Though the band generally plays gigs at off-campus venues such as P.A.’s Lounge in Somerville and The Cantab Lounge in Central, they first performed at The Harvard Advocate and have played there several times since.
“They’ve been very good to us,” notes Newmark. Since their first Harvard gig at the Advocate, L.A. Jeff has played at The Lampoon, WHRB, and…Adams House?
“That was the worst gig,” laughs Schwalbe. (“The best worst gig,” a bandmate softly corrects.) “Twenty feet of people playing fucking corn toss in front of us, and anyone who wanted to listen was, like, forty feet away,” Crane adds.
The band has recently reunited after a break that began in December. Schwalbe reflects on the break, saying it has given the band “time to come up with a lot of new stuff, so in that way, it’s been positive to take a break.” Additionally the band is looking forward to a trip to New York in April. “I grew up in New York, and I have a lot of friends who do live music,” Rouhani says, “So it’s gonna be good.”
L.A. Jeff’s style may be well-suited for a New York City club, but how do they fare amongst their fellow Harvard students?
“There’s definitely a contingent of people who will come and see us,” says Crane. The group does, however, have a niche: “It’s really the radio and artsier kids because we’re all involved in that,” explains Newmark. Despite their specific audience, L.A. Jeff shows consistently attract fans. “Last time we played at P.A.’s [this past December] we had like 40 or 45 kids, and we were off-campus,” Crane recalls.
The student body will soon get their exposure to L.A. Jeff as they battle for a coveted spot in the 2014 Yardfest lineup. “We’re gonna be running against Hot Breakfast,” Schwalbe says. I ask L.A. Jeff what they think of Hot Breakfast, another on-campus band. “I’m gonna choose not to comment,” says Schwalbe.
“Oh, we went to their show,” Rouhani says. “It was fun, they played very conventional songs.” Schwalbe adds, “They know what they’re doing. They’re a cover band, which is not a problem, it’s just different. For us, it’s just part of the package with playing original stuff. The thing is, Harvard doesn’t have a bustling music scene, and especially for something like Yardfest which is played to, you know, what the majority wants, it’s understandable that we may not be what the majority wants. But I think we’re pretty content with that. There is more of a niche here for bands that just go play popular cover songs which, again, is not bad, it’s just different.”

It’s 2 a.m. on a Thursday night. Outside it’s freezing cold, pitch-black, and windy.
At first, these circumstances made my trek to Pennypacker seem adventurous, but now, as I stand in the dark with frozen toes and wind-whipped eyes, trying to figure out just where this Pennypacker place is, I’m having second thoughts.
I’m here because Pennypacker’s basement is home to WHRB, a commercial FM radio station run by Harvard undergraduates. The station itself dates back to the 1940s and was originally affiliated with The Harvard Crimson. From jazz to classical to blues and even opera, for the past seventy years, WHRB has broadcast just about every conceivable type of music.
I’m here for WHRB’s late night, underground, little-known rock program: Record Hospital.
When I knock on the door of Pennypacker’s basement, Billy A. Janitsch ’15, tall, lanky, and dressed in all black, lets me in. His set starts at 2 a.m., but he has a few minutes to show me around. As we walk through the station, Janitsch gives me the lowdown on Record Hospital’s history.
The program was started in the ’80s by Harvard undergraduates working at WHRB who wanted to appreciate, discover, and play less, well, “conventional” music. They named the program Record Hospital, a play on the popular soap opera “General Hospital.”
Record Hospital occupies the airwaves every night from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. This late time slot allows a certain liberty; the DJs play songs laced with profanity and experiment with grittier music that’s been banished from the mainstream airwaves and WHRB’s other programs.
“Our goal is to play stuff no one has heard before and expose people to new music,” Janitsch explains. “I guess you could say that anything that’s too weird to be played by another department is fair game.”
We step into the lounge, the room where all of the program’s music is kept. Shelves and shelves of records line the walls; more lie catalogued in boxes that litter the floor. While most college radio shows play their music off computers, Record Hospital encourages DJs to make use of its vinyl collection. It’s an opportunity to engage with the music on a different level, to sift through the apocrypha of modern music and land on a hidden masterpiece.
Janitsch has to begin his set. I follow him inside the recording studio and take a seat on the ragged couch in the corner. My eyes are drooping, and I have class in seven hours, but I’m strangely focused. What does he mean by “weird”?
The first song Janitsch plays is “No Heroes” by Converge. He describes it as mathcore, “a mixture of the more aggressive side of hardcore with the more technical aspects of math.” Janitsch is the expert here, and I have to trust him. But, if I’m being honest, “No Heroes” sounds kind of like a few guitars laid over a grown man’s temper tantrum.
But as the show goes on—minutes ticking by, the dark outside growing denser—Janitsch plays some music that I genuinely like. I’m drawn to a song called “Heartbeat in the Brain.” The mellow instrumentals, idiosyncratic lyrics, and general lack of grunts or screams catch my attention. When I ask, Janitsch tells me the band is called The World is a Beautiful Place and I am No Longer Afraid to Die, or TWBP, for short. For some reason I’m not really surprised.
One hour and about 20 songs later, my sense of exhaustion is too great to ignore. I want to stay, but I can hardly keep my eyes open. Janitsch, on the other hand, is alive with motion, switching records and flipping switches. He’ll be here for another hour.
I thank Janitsch and head back out into the wind with music ringing in my head.

Construction will shortly begin on the long-anticipated International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor—a machine that, if it works, promises to solve most of the world’s energy problems for the next 30 million years. Howard M. Georgi ’68, a Harvard physics professor, sat down for a brief chat about how and whether ITER will actually work as well as its possible economic and political implications.
1. Fifteen Minutes: Could you explain in layperson’s terms what the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor is and what it does?
Howard M. Georgi: The quick summary is simple–it makes energy in a way very similar to the way the sun makes energy, by fusing hydrogen into helium....The problem with fusion is that to get [nuclei] to come together you have to get [charged hydrogen nuclei] going very fast and get them to run into one another in order to let this reaction happen....The strategy of most of the games at the moment is to fuse rare isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium and tritium) into helium, which means there’s an extra neutron left over. And that’s advantageous for a number of reasons, but in particular the neutron can then get out and carry the energy from where the fusion is going on out into the surrounding area....It’s this elegant balancing act; there’s a whole bunch of delicate balancing acts with this process.
2. FM: So here’s the big question: do you think it will actually work?
HMG: I actually have no idea. I’ll be surprised if I find out in my lifetime because I think it’s quite a long-term project....I think that [the goal of beginning experiments in 2020] is great, and I await the results with interest, but it’s such a complicated project. I’m a theorist and just a tiny, tiny piece of this is the theory. By far the bulk of it is the engineering and real civil construction and the politics, which is probably the biggest part of it. Somehow we managed to get that done with the [Large Hadron Collider] and occasionally with huge telescopes, and those are motivated differently because those are purely for basic research.... This is much more applied, but certainly the engineering is no easier.
3. FM: In the event it actually works, the impact would be absolutely phenomenal though, right?
HMG: Oh absolutely.... It’s great because they’re just starting to build it and [in] starting to test it they will learn a lot. We will learn a lot about, for example, the properties of plasmas in very high magnetic fields, and that’s interesting for lots of good scientific reasons. And they will learn a tremendous amount about how to engineer a project of that scale and that complexity. So all of that is terrific. Where it goes after that, I don’t know.

My mother is making a tarte tatin: an upside-down, caramelized apple tart. It’s a classic French dessert—and my favorite. She leans over the stove. The tines of the fork in her hand turn over the apple halves that nestle together in the cast iron skillet one by one by one. Her hands are scarred from years of working in a commercial kitchen. A nail bed on the left is split down the center from when a knife slipped and all of a sudden, it wasn’t the carrots that she was chopping so finely. That was years ago, before I was born, before she quit working at the restaurant.
I am twenty now. It is winter break, and this is my last night home from college. The tarte tatin was my unspoken request. And, even though she’s a teacher, not a chef, these days, Mamma is making it for me. She has always made sure that we have eaten well.
I wish I knew how to do this, I tell her. You never wanted to learn, she responds. And she’s probably right: I would rather eat than bake. There is a glass of Riesling on the grey-green granite counter next to the waiting crust. The apples are nearly done now, golden brown—almost, but not quite, blackened in spots. Mamma and I lean towards each other across the island in the kitchen, talking: no, I haven’t packed the freshly cleaned laundry yet; yes, her class is really wonderful this year. She promises to teach me to cook if I’m really interested—it’s a life skill. We’re babbling mostly. She’s watching the skillet, and I’m watching her.
In a minute, she will whisk the skillet off the burner, move it over towards the pie pan sitting on counter, and coax the apples into the pan. She will do it all in one fluid motion. Afterwards, she will cover the apples with a round, yellow-tinted pie dough circle, slide the pan into the oven, and wait. When it is done, she will slide it out again and let the tart sit. The fruit will relax into itself, and the caramelly juice will seep towards edge of the pastry, settling before it gets too far. For a moment, the whole thing will be beautiful: a lush, glazed spiral of apple wedges curling in upon themselves. But then, the tarte tatin will cool, and my father and I will ruin the picture—cut into it, serve ourselves thick slices, and eat them quickly, the apples pliant and smooth in our mouths, mugs of chilled milk in each of our hands. We will get seconds as we always do. And, it will be delicious; I know: Mamma is making it.
When she was twenty-six and he was twenty-five, my mother and father moved 3,000 miles across the country to a tiny town on the Mendocino Coast of California so Mamma could spend six months at a culinary internship at the Cafe Beaujolais, a well-known French restaurant run in a crooked, yellow Victorian house that looks out to the ocean. The food was great; the area was isolated. They could have gone to Chicago. “But everyone goes to Chicago,” my father had said, so they came to California instead. They’re still here.
It was at the Cafe Beaujolais, not culinary school, that Mamma first learned how to make a tarte tatin. She had been manager for a few weeks when the owners went out to a dinner party and left the tart listed as dessert on the night’s menu. If it’s on the menu, you better make it. To this day, she will occasionally describe the acute panic she felt upon coming into work that evening, seeing the tart listed and thinking to herself What do I do? What do I do? I don’t know how to make this!
Six skillets of Granny Smiths gurgled up at her—you have to use Granny Smiths if you’re going to make a tarte tatin right (they’re firm, with enough of a bite)—as she called the Cafe Beaujolais’s owners at their friend’s house. They talked her through making the tart step by step over the phone.  One line from that conversation has stuck for all these years: “the apples have to spoon each other in the pan.”
Every time Mamma makes a tarte tatin these days, she tells this story. She does so now as she pulls the tart out of the oven, flips the concoction upside down, and slides it onto a purple earthenware plate, inverting the crust and carefully working the pan away from the apples. I perch on a barstool, watching. Perfect. It’s the product of experience. She’s made the tart hundreds of times by now—the result of eight and a half years at the Beaujolais and half a lifetime of feeding my father. The rest of the food is already waiting. Pork chops are piled onto a plate at the kitchen table next to a bowl of mashed potatoes and another with a vegetable medley. Somewhere there is a pitcher of jus. It’s dinnertime.
Tomorrow morning my father and I will fill the backseat of his truck with my suitcases and books. He will drive me to the airport in San Francisco, and I will leave the Coast for Boston again. We will probably eat a slice of tarte tatin for breakfast before we go—it’s always better the next day. Somehow it seems fitting that exceptionally good food is both what brought my parents to the Mendocino Coast and what I associate with leaving it. This summer, maybe, I will ask Mamma to teach me how to make it myself, but tonight, we eat.

Though Final Clubs, fraternities, and sororities are long-standing staples of the Harvard social scene, their presence is anything but static. Last year, sorority Alpha Phi set down its roots in Cambridge, while fraternity Kappa Sigma reinstated its Harvard chapter last week after an eighty-year hiatus. FM digs into the archives to create a chronology of Harvard’s dynamic Greek life.
1779
The third chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, America’s first Greek collegiate society, is established at Harvard College.
1837
The Harvard chapter of Alpha Delta Phi, from which the AD Club originates, is founded.
1852
A chapter of the Zeta Psi fraternity, to which the Spee Club traces its origins, is founded.
1860
Alpha Delta Phi surrenders its charter following an internal disagreement over the Civil War.
1876
Theodore Roosevelt enrolls in Harvard College, where he becomes a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon and Alpha Delta Phi.
1893
Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s parent organization, Massachusetts Gamma, is established on March 17.
1896
The Phi Delta Psi fraternity is founded, just nine years before being recognized as the Owl club.
1914
26 undergraduate clubs, including Harvard’s seven fraternities, sign an agreement to forbid canvassing and pledging students in their freshman year. This pact is later abandoned by many of these organizations.
1933
Kappa Sigma voluntarily disbands, a dissolution that the fraternity’s website attributes “to actions by the University.”
1988
Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III contests that the University cannot officially recognize fraternities because of “a policy against single sex institutions...Harvard groups also cannot be affiliated with national organizations.”
1989
A chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity is founded at Harvard. Chartered in 1992, Sigma Chi is, according its the website, the “oldest continuously active fraternity at Harvard University.”
1991
In a Crimson article detailing controversial recruitment letters sent out by Sigma Alpha Mu, the former Dean Epps states that the University has “very great doubts about the efficacy of fraternities, because many have the reputation for the abuse of alcohol and for interference with academic work.”
1993
Harvard’s first sorority, a chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta, is founded on campus. Kappa Alpha Theta was also the United States’ first all-female Greek organization.
1994
Delta Gamma, one of Harvard’s four sororities, is founded.
2001
After the disbanding of its flagship charter, Massachusetts Gamma, in 1980, SAE is re-established as Harvard’s third fraternity.
2002
Mark Zuckerberg joins Alpha Epsilon Pi, or “AEPi.”
2011
Sororities welcome the largest rush class in Harvard history, with 268 undergraduates rushing the three organizations. This same year, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon all acquire off-campus social spaces.
2013
Alpha Phi, which according to its website is “consistently ranked #1” among US sororities, becomes Harvard’s fourth sorority.
2014
Kappa Sigma is re-established as Harvard’s fourth fraternity, after 80 years of inactivity.

Please sit down. We’re passing out booklets now. You should have a question sheet and two booklets. Raise your hand if you—sorry about that James, there you go. You’ll have 53 minutes; there are four sections. We’ve included a suggested time for each section. I’ll also keep track of how much time is left on the board. And...begin.
These days, midterm season encompasses nearly the entire semester. Some classes have two or three midterms. Right now, between Somerville and Allston, an evil and innovative professor is devising a syllabus with four midterms.
Surely there’s a rule against this kind of cruelty in the dictionary. It is a midterm, as in middle of the term, and there aren’t three middles, except maybe in abstract math. Merriam-Webster confirms that a midterm is “an examination given at the middle of a school term.” Not two examinations.
Americans apparently invented the idea. The British definitional authority, the Oxford English Dictionary, dates the first usage of midterm to 1456: “Thair lord suld..geve thaim sum part [of their pay] in the myd terme.” Perhaps the next campaign for the UC could be replacing midterm exams with a mid-semester festival where University President Drew G. Faust hands out dollar bills to puzzled students.
Harvard was way behind the curve on adopting midterms. On April 10, 1892, students at the State Normal School in Albany took midterm examinations. “Never in the history of the college,” wrote the New York Tribune, “has there been more earnest and effective work.” That same week Harvard students took a spring recess, rowing boats on the Charles for their “vacation athletic activity.”
The first usage of midterm referring to a university examination came just a few years earlier in 1889. Horace Davis, the president of the University of California, was to blame. He thought final examinations were “a poor way of finding out” whether a student is learning. Yes! Abolish finals!
Davis continued, “The daily recitation is a better test of...progress.” While it would be hilarious to watch 900 freshmen recite the definition of Net Export Demand to a grinning Greg Mankiw, rote learning has been largely discredited. Maybe Davis didn’t know what he was talking about. “When instruction is by lectures solely, mid-term or monthly off-hand examinations are more efficient.” Monthly? Davis resigned the next year, sparing California undergraduates of further harm.
But his words do suggest a potential solution to today’s linguistic contradiction of multiple midterms. Professors could return to Davis’s more specific formulation and administer “monthly off-hand examinations.” It is a softer phrase, with the extra syllables, the hyphen, and the “off” implying a certain casualness to something that will determine 30 percent of your grade.
Already professors differ on their terminology. In Math 55 and Physics 15b, there are two “midterms.” In Ec10, there are two “exams” that occur during the middle of the semester. In most of my classes, there are “no exams,” because I study the humanities.
I did take one recently, writing down all the facts I could remember about the late Roman Empire in a little white book. The color of the books sometimes is blue, and briefly in 1990, turned yellow for financial reasons, which led to a hyperbolic article in The Crimson about the “psychological implications” of a brighter hue.
Next fall, the University should consider replacing the blue books with red ones, since the Republicans will probably win the midterm elections. And that’s the final definition of the word. Time’s up.

Jill Lepore’s office is leaking books. They’re crowded onto the dark brown shelves that line her walls, stacked vertically and horizontally, vying for space, certainly not in alphabetical order. They form precarious piles on the edges of her desk, but if they tip, no matter—they’ll only join piles on the floor.
Histories. Essay collections. Novels. An encyclopedia. One giant blue volume that contains the complete works of Charles Dickens.
On the edge of her desk, in the shadow of a particularly tall pile of books, lies a single newspaper. Not today’s New York Times: it’s a paper dated November 23, 1963, its bolded headline concerning JFK’s assassination. When I try to move my seat forward, I can’t; it’s part of a row of seats from Somerville Movie Theater. It’s an archivist’s paradise.
Lepore sits beyond her desk, in the center of the shelves, leaning back in her chair with her arms stretched alternately behind her head or vaguely toward a conversationally-appropriate book. Her short hair fans out to the right and left; her glasses frame wide, bright eyes.
If she ever wanted to, Lepore could fill one of those shelves just with her own words. The David Woods Kemper ’41 Professor of American History and chair of Harvard’s history and literature program, Lepore has written seven academic works, compiled a collection of essays, and co-penned a novel with Brandeis University professor Jane Kamensky. Also with Kamensky, she co-founded a longform magazine called Common-place. Her writer’s page on The New Yorker website is 30 pages long.
Though her accomplishments are numerous, to understand Lepore is not to merely scroll through her resume or the first page that comes up when you Google her name. Rather, it’s an exploration through an archive of sorts—a space as crowded and full of treasures as her office, labyrinth-like, full of unexpected words and ideas. Her work as an academic, a professor, and a magazine writer is to bring alive documents of the past; speaking with her is like encountering a living book.
She’s a narrative historian, and her own historical narrative (from child scouring the library for George Orwell essays, to secretary auditing Harvard history courses, to tenured professor and accomplished magazine writer) has all of the delights and complexities of the stories she tells.
Lepore’s fans know her from many fields: they turn the pages of her books, they lead class discussions with her, they sit at a seminar table hanging on to her words. She has become everything that her historical subjects were not while they lived: widely read and well-known.
PATH OF THE PAST
Physically, the past is present in Lepore’s office—the movie theater seats, the newspaper. She calls it her “Harry Potter cupboard under the stairs.” Lepore seems to have a habit of collecting unwanted and abandoned objects, the proverbial treasures of someone else’s trash.
Once, when she was working as a secretary at Harvard Business School (her first job at the University), just before the school’s main building underwent a major renovation, her bemused boss told her that she could keep her desk. “I drove over to the Business School with screwdrivers and unbolted it and drove it home to our crazy vegan co-op. I had it there and I brought it to grad school,” she says. “I had that desk until tenure.”
In college, this habit seemed to fit in with a life philosophy of sorts. “[Your generation] has internships and stepping stones, building NGOs in Zimbabwe and start-ups in Canada,” she tells me. “My generation, we read Kurt Vonnegut on the smelly futon you found in the street that works as a couch in your apartment with six people. You ate beans and that was your life.” Her sarcasm is light-hearted, her nostalgia both self-deprecating and wistful.
And it seems that Lepore found her life’s passion and career in much the same way that she finds her furniture—items long needed and then spontaneously re-discovered. She grew up in West Boylston, Mass., on Franklin Street, as in Ben (and Jane, his sister, the subject of Lepore’s latest book). Her father was a junior high school principal who met her mother when he hired her as an art teacher. In a memoir piece she wrote for The New Yorker called “The Prodigal Daughter,” Lepore writes that her mother kept a collapsible easel and set of paints in the trunk of her car. When not painting, she “liked to command me to do things I found scary,” Lepore writes.
This included applying to college. As a teenager, Lepore did not want to continue her education (“Oh, I was just a difficult teenager, weren’t you?” she asks). She only decided to do so after receiving a Reserve Officers’ Training Corps scholarship to Tufts University. She began as a math major. After a year, though, she dropped both ROTC and math, and switched to  English instead. To make up for the lost scholarship, she finished her degree at Tufts in three years, working as a secretary at Harvard, where she audited history classes.
When I asked what led to this sudden change, Lepore smiled and said: “You’re trying to get me to tell the letter story, aren’t you?”
She’s discussed it in interviews before: After her first year of college, Lepore received a letter forwarded from her home address. It was written by her, four years earlier—one of those time capsule projects you do in high school. In it, teenage-Lepore chastised college-student-Lepore for her life choices, accusing her of neglecting her real passions and wasting her time.
“It was totally mean and harangue-y—I was a really rotten teenager,” she says. “But it really affected me, and it sat with me for a while before I decided to change everything in my life.”
It also led her to think about the importance of the past. “What would it be like to read really old mail from actual strangers instead of fairly recent mail from yourself?”
The first time she entered the Widener stacks, she says, she sat down and cried.
She had fallen in love with history, but getting into a master’s program in the field would be challenging without having majored in it. Then, working at the Bunting Institute, now the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies, Lepore met Elizabeth McKinsey, an English and American Studies scholar who now teaches at Carleton College.
McKinsey recommend that Lepore apply to graduate programs in American Studies. “It was an incredible gift she gave me, this advice.”
Lepore enrolled at the University of Michigan, but then transferred to Yale for what she describes as “the usual stupid reasons”—she wanted to be closer to a boyfriend in Boston. There, she specialized in the history of early America and met two individuals who were integral to her career—  Jane Kamensky, with whom Lepore would go on co-found Common-place and write a historical novel called “Blindspot,” and their mentor, professor emeritus John Demos. In an interview with The Crimson in 2009, Lepore said that she and Kamensky originally conceived the novel project as a way to honor Demos at his retirement.
After earning her Ph.D. from Yale, Lepore worked as a professor at the University of California-San Diego and Boston University before coming back to Harvard to help lead the department whose classes she once audited. Not exactly “Good Will Hunting,” she says, but cinematic nevertheless. She now lives in Cambridge with her husband and three sons.
As untraditionally as her career unfolded, Lepore says she was sure of one thing. “I always just wanted to be a writer, not necessarily a particular kind of writer,” she says. “Since childhood, I wrote a lot of fiction, a lot of stories, but I most loved writing essays. I was obsessed with George Orwell for years. I remember going to the town library and having to put in interlibrary loan requests to get the compilation of his BBC radio pieces. I had to get everything he ever wrote.”
History of Art and Architecture professor Robin E. Kelsey says that Lepore’s non-traditional background helps her connect with students: “She has an outside-of-the-ivory-tower perspective. It’s very easy once you’re inside this world to lose track of what this place looks like if you’re an eighteen-year-old coming from say, a working-class family. She’s exceptionally sensitive to people coming from other backgrounds.”
HISTORY IS WHAT REMAINS
When I meet with Lepore, we do step out of the ivory tower (or the Robinson marble).
“Take a look around you,” Lepore tells me. We’ve stopped outside of Memorial Church. “Now close your eyes. Take a deep breath.”
“Open your eyes, and imagine that it’s 1767,” she says. “What’s different?”
I feel silly, and at first, I only notice the obvious things: the iPhones, the distant rush of cars on Massachusetts Ave., the typed flyers advertising events and extracurriculars, the neon-colored backpacks, and the rubber snow boots. The cleanliness of it all. But this is more than the superficial evocation of the past in the manner of hoop-skirt sporting tour guides. Lepore’s also referring to something larger and more intangible, the way the writing of history is affected by the limited and sometimes unreliable preservation of the past.
“History is only written from what remains,” Lepore says. She raises and lowers her hand, as if to the suggest the construction and demolition of phantom buildings.
From inside a long, black puffy coat, she pulls out a printed copy of a 1767 engraving. It’s by Paul Revere, titled “A Westerly View of Colleges in New England.” Flanked by horses and men in breaches stand five buildings, labeled: Harvard Hall, Stoughton, Massachusetts, Hollis, and Holden Chapel.
She says she often gives this engraving to students in History 1400: “Intro to American Studies,” a class she’s co-teaching this spring with English professor Louis Menand. It’s one of her many “hands-on activities”—besides bringing her students to archives and museums, Lepore brings facsimiles of period newspapers into section.
“History is this great time machine, and I love that about it,” Lepore says. “You can go backward and hang out there as long as you need to.”
Entering Lepore’s world often requires leaving her office. Her Q Guide comments, accompanied by insanely high scores, rave about field trips to 18th-century printing presses and the Boston cemeteries where founding fathers lie interred. Teaching at BU, she once organized an overnight camping trip to the Boston Harbor Islands.
At Harvard, she holds “walking office hours.” “I’m super restless, and I cannot stand sitting in my Harry Potter cupboard beneath the stairs,” she says. “Moving is good—it’s about the pause. You think when you’re moving.”
During these walks, the length and nature of the route depends on the complexity of the question. “What kind of citations should we use for this paper?” might mean a walk around the Yard; life-goal questions extend out into Cambridge.
Lepore’s class  “How to Read a Book,” which she co-taught with English professor Leah Price ’91, was similarly tactile and immersive. Brian K. Goodman, a Ph.D. candidate in American Studies and a teaching fellow for the class, describes it as “experimental.”
In teaching about the history of note-taking, Lepore and Price had their students take notes with the tools of the period they were studying, from ancient to contemporary. “When you imagine what your first teaching experience is going to be like, you don’t think you’re going to need to learn how to get a hold of historically authentic quills,” Goodman says. “We made clay tablets, we did quills and parchments, we visited a printing press, and in the last week, you could use your iPad.”
Sometimes Lepore’s experimental lesson plans have unintended consequences. Wax candles added to the period atmosphere, until one student, quill in hand and elbow in air, knocked a candle on to a piece of parchment and started a small fire.
STUDENT/TEACHERS
Lepore often co-teaches. While other professors can be reluctant to share the classroom, Lepore describes it as a “blessing.”
When I ask her why, she grins and scrunches up her shoulders, “Oh, I like being a student! There’s no greater gift than to be able to listen to a colleague give a lecture.”
Co-teaching can also provide a relief from an academic culture that often encourages isolation. “It’s meant to be kind of a lonely life—monastic,” she says. “There’s not a culture where you can just walk into other people’s classes.”
Lepore also says that co-teaching can make a subject more accessible to students. When two accomplished academics debate, they see that a subject can be approached from multiple angles. But Lepore gets along so well with her co-professors that she has to make a conscious effort to disagree with them for the benefit of the class.
And just as Lepore speaks about the joy of learning from her colleagues, Kelsey and Menand say that they’ve learned from her. The former says that he’s inspired by her document-based approach to history, while the latter praises her interactive, project-oriented sections.
Kelsey, who plans to co-teach a graduate seminar about the American attic with Lepore next year, tells me he knows her outside of the University setting; their children go to the same school.
Of Lepore, he says: “She’s a bit of a dynamo, very much on topic and to the point. And yet she manages to do that while remaining exceedingly cheerful and funny. She’s a joy to be around.”
Menand, currently her co-teacher, says simply, “She’s a ball of fire.”
INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES
Lepore often chooses co-teachers in fields different from her own, creating syllabi that are interdisciplinary. She is the chair of history and literature, one of only a few interdisciplinary committees at Harvard. Of her committee’s approach, she says, “I really believe in the method of a discipline, but some of the artificiality of the departmental boundaries can be exposed.”
“[In hist. & lit.], if you’re interested in what happened to a man, woman, or child, there are many ways you can find out—through acts of investigation, discovery, and analysis. You can experiment,” she continues. “Almost anything is game.”
The nature of interdisciplinary study is something that Lepore has spent a lot of time meditating on. On the one hand, there’s something to be said for the discipline of a discipline: “I’m a big believer in that word in all its senses—I’m a super-hyper-vigilant person, a deadline nut,” she says. “And the constraints of a discipline can be really interesting. It’s like physical training. Squats are really freaking good for you, and it’s not because a squat in and of itself is an accomplishment, but it improves everything you do to some extent.”
I ask Lepore what changes she’s implemented to the committee since becoming chair, but it’s hard to get her to talk about herself in any way that might remotely suggest listing accomplishments. (Earlier, when I had asked her which of her New Yorker pieces is her favorite, she waved her hand impatiently and offered to tell me all of her favorite pieces by other writers instead.) So she starts by placing herself between her predecessor, Price, and her successor, Amanda J. Claybaugh, also of the English Department, who will be taking over on the first of July.  Of Price, Lepore says that she’s “learned so much from her,” and of Claybaugh she’s “incredibly excited to see what she’ll do.”
As for herself, Lepore explained that her placement between two English Department chairs was a deliberate choice to bring balance to the department. “I spent a lot of time trying to think about the history part of history and literature, because the position had been held for a very, very long time by people from the English Department. We got more History faculty to become involved.”
THE CULT OF LEPORE
Though her seminar-style classes obviously attract fewer student than Sanders-filling lectures like CS50 and EC10, Lepore has developed a small, but loyal following of fans and mentees. “There’s definitely a cult of personality around her,” Isaac C. Dayno ’15 says.
And her classes, though usually capped at fewer than twenty students, garner many more applicants.  Some, like Dayno, are introduced to Lepore through her magazine writing. “I read The New Yorker and happened to discover that all of these articles I was obsessed with were written by this one woman named Jill Lepore, and she was a Harvard professor,” Elyssa A. L. Spitzer ’12, a former FM chair, says. “I emailed her and asked if we could talk.”
Even though Spitzer was concentrating in social studies, she wanted to use a hist. & lit. approach for her thesis. After a series of conversations with Lepore, some conducted on walks to the Charles River, Spitzer decided to write about William Godwin. Lepore became her thesis advisor. And along the way, also talked with her about her career plans and general life path.
Many of Lepore’s mentees discuss Lepore’s willingness to offer help outside of her area of academic expertise and beyond the class materials. Edgar Allan Poe? She’s obsessed with him. World War II? She has books numbering in the double digits for students to read.
She makes time to help not only her own students and thesis mentees, but anyone who comes to her with a question. “When my prospectus was due, I sent her a copy because I was interested to see what her thoughts would be,” Goodman says. “I was about to leave the country for a year, and she met me at seven in the morning right before I left town. And she wasn’t even on my dissertation committee.
“She’s always extremely generous with her students,” Goodman continues. “But she’s got this unique combination of toughness and kindness. She has high expectations for her students.”
Speaking about her classroom relationships, Lepore says, “It’s not about intimacy.”
“No, no, I don’t do that,” she says, as she lifts up her hand, palm out, and shakes her head. “But it’s about candor.”
THE NOBODIES
For all the attention she pays to her students and colleagues, Lepore seems to engage just as thoroughly with historical characters. At Houghton Library, she shows me the diary of Jared Sparks, an early American historian and Harvard professor who obsessively collected any and all papers relating to the founding fathers. He also altered, edited, and destroyed historical documents written by those whom he deemed “nobodies,” once ripping up a draft of a George Washington speech because it had been transcribed by an unknown clerk.
One of those “nobodies” was Benjamin Franklin’s sister, the subject of Lepore’s most recent work, “The Book of Ages: The Life and Opinions of Jane Franklin.” While her brother became one of the most towering and consequential figures of American history, Jane married at thirteen and had 12 children, several of whom died.
For Lepore, writing about Jane was part of her broader concern for representing what she calls the “asymmetry” of history, the imbalance that occurs in our understanding of the past when narratives are controlled by those with power. This motivation inspired her writing about King Philip’s War, focusing on the perspective of the defeated Native American tribes, as well as “New York Burning,”  her book about New York’s slave rebellion in 1741, which was nominated for the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for History.
Her works often highlight Sparks’s so-called “nobodies.” “If we’re interested in inequality as a society, it’s helpful to have a historical vantage on it,” she says. “You need to see these people as individuals with fully realized lives.”
“With Benjamin Franklin, you know when he slept with some prostitute in London to the hour,” she continues. “But when you know so little [about someone] to just shrug and say ‘shh’ is a very familiar maneuver.”
In order to write about subjects when such details are not readily available, Lepore does extensive archival research. I get to see her in action, examining the uneven sheets of parchment bound together in Sparks’s diary.
“I’m just so excited!” Lepore says, beaming, rubbing her hands together as she bends down over the text to decipher frustratingly tiny handwriting. According to Lepore, “none of the good stuff is digital yet.”
Earlier, in her office, Lepore spoke about the deep satisfaction that comes with the tangibility of physical archives.
“Who leaps out of bed in the morning to read The New York Herald Tribune from 1929 online?” she asks. “But if you’re going into the newspaper room at the archive—I don’t know, I kind of leap out of bed for that.”
When she gets excited about something, Lepore twists a little bit in her chair and grins. This is not uncommon: “I’m the person who laughs too loud at the joke. I’m so easily amused. I’m so easily fascinated, and so easily devastated.”
WRITING AND TRUTH
In minute details and minor characters, Lepore finds the hidden angles of history—though she’s careful to qualify that “microhistories” should be used to “interpret larger historical structures.”
Lepore thinks a lot about the relationship between story and statement of truth. Literature and history, she says, have, respectively “the truth of the universal and the truth of the particular.”
Her essay “Just the Facts, Ma’am,” explores the way in which history can be just as factually problematic as fiction: “Every history is incomplete; every historian has a point of view; every historian relies on what is unreliable—documents written by people who were not under oath and cannot be cross-examined.”
Lepore tries to resolve these difficulties in her own writing by trying to “squeeze as much as we can out of letters...pushing as far as we can go.” This often means exploring previously overlooked documents and perspectives.
And once the evidence falls into place, there’s the question of presentation. Lepore considers herself a narrative historian, and students, like Emily C. Graff ’10, a former FM chair, say that she taught them how to make historical writing compelling and persuasive in that manner.
“‘To write history is to make an argument by telling a story about dead people,’” Graff quotes Lepore. “When I was writing papers…I was always using my head, never my heart. She helped me to see that you had to use both to look critically and also analytically.”
Lepore also employs a narrative writing style in the essays she writes for The New Yorker. “When you’re writing for a general interest magazine, you’ve got this thing that a body of experts knows a lot about, that is rich and detailed and tangled, full of contradiction and distortion and subtlety and significance and meaningfulness, and here’s this reader that’s super smart but doesn’t know anything about it,” she says. “You have to make it interesting without stomping on it and beating the subtlety out of it.”
Lepore connects this to her work as a teacher, where she also has to convey specialized or expert knowledge to an audience that might have no knowledge of the specific topic. “The student could be a brilliant engineering concentrator but doesn’t know about the history of the paper ballot,” she says.
But Lepore says she also fears that relying too much on the narrative aspects of the past can undermine what she says is a historian’s main job: argument through evidence. She explains that historical writing that tells a story can focus on narration at the cost of analysis. For historical writing to be both compelling and worthwhile, it must combine “thick narratives” with “pregnant principles,” she writes in “Writing for History.” She says that the trick is weaving together the characters and chronology of the past with a focused and evidenced argument.
Lepore’s concerns about the style of narrative history are also personal. “Being a woman writer, it’s very, very easy to sort of build for yourself a box that says ‘I’m emotionally attached to my subject matter.’ We have a culture of letters that expects women to be writing about things that are emotional and personal,” she says.
Menand spoke about how Lepore navigates the emotional appeal of narration and the critical necessity of academia in her own writing. “You can’t just tell the story, you also have to have some idea what it means,” he says. “The trick is to make the story produce the idea, not just to overlay it with some analysis. She’s really good at that.”
EPILOGUE
On the last day we meet, we leave Houghton after about an hour—Lepore is on deadline tonight.
In the Yard, where the sun has begun to set, students trek to the dining halls for dinner. I’m blinded again by the reflection of sun on snow, so I close my eyes and try imagine that it’s 1767. Lepore had asked, “What’s different?”
Everything that is gone: the sounds and the smells, smoke, animals—all that organic matter. And all that has been added: any building larger than Harvard Hall, at that time the tallest in Cambridge. Female students and professors. The finally-published stories of those once dismissed as “nobodies.” Classes that go beyond the lecture hall, into the archives and onto the streets of Boston. An office leaking books, stuffed with found treasures, containing multitudes of words. One professor, surrounded by history, sits behind her desk—collecting and recording, penning a couple hundred more words to be read, studied, and cited by many.
Sections


Today, the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College is a choir of more than 100 members. Its mission “to express the creativity and spirituality of black people through song” has endured over the years, though the group has experienced many changes and faced various challenges since its founding in 1970. “No one person can understand Kuumba completely,” the choir’s vice president Matthew S. Williams ’14 says. “It’s still a mystery to me how this group has been able to last and maintain so much of what makes it itself for so long.”
The Beginnings
In the late 1960s, colleges across the nation saw an influx in the numbers of black students arriving to their campuses. This was partly a response to Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination a couple of years before, which sparked a change in the nation’s conscience and caused colleges to open their doors to the black community, as charter member and Alumni President Linda Jackson Sowell ’73 explains. At Harvard, the Class of 1973 included around 30 black women and 75 black men; the previous year had only about 10 black women and 30 black men.
Yet this increase in the number of black students on Harvard’s campus did not necessarily come with a proportional increase in resources and outlets specifically for the black community at Harvard.
“Not only did the curriculum offer little that dealt with the unique history and experience of black people, but the institution itself was culturally alien, and sometimes even hostile, to students of African descent,” Kuumba Singers founder Dennis W. Wiley    ’72 wrote in an essay published in Kuumba’s 30th anniversary commemorative booklet.
Current president Lauren E. Fields ’14 adds, “People were sensing a lot of tension and a lot of isolation of the black students.”
“We didn’t really feel that welcome in the traditional organizations on campus,” Sowell says. “Since there were now more of us on campus, it presented an opportunity to create some institutions for ourselves.”
In the spring of 1970, Wiley and his classmate Fred A. Lucas ’72 took a class on the history of black music taught by professor Hubert E. Walters, who later became Kuumba’s first director. Inspired by this class, the two students co-founded a choir, and held the first official meeting in November, 1970, in the old Freshman Union. They wanted to create “a space where people could just come and feel appreciated,” Fields says. Wiley and Lucas named their choir “Kuumba,” which means “create” in Swahili.
Sowell says recruitment was easy in the small black community on campus. “All you had to do was go to a couple of places and go, ‘You want to sing?’ That pretty much did it.”
On Their Own
At first, Fields says, the University was unreceptive to this fledgling organization. “Nothing was easy,” Sowell recalls. “We had to fight for everything.”
Without a real rehearsal space, practices were held in the Freshman Union, then the freshman dining hall. After students had finished their meals, Kuumba members would re-arrange their chairs for practice. As there was no piano, the group sang a capella. Sometimes, the choir even practiced in students’ dorm rooms, where the conductor led the group while sitting on a bed.
For many years the choir was underfunded and had to raise all of its own money. On one tour, the group could not afford a bus ride back to campus, so they asked the audience at their final performance for donations and ended up with just enough to make it back.
When the University released Walters from his contract, tensions rose. The official reason for this termination was that Walters had not acquired his doctorate within an allotted period of time. Fields, however, thinks “it was very clear that it was due to his personal involvement in Kuumba.”
The club’s director of publicity, Ada D. Lin ’14, adds that Kuumba was then very politically active, and the administration “didn’t feel like they could have a faculty member who was associated with that.”
Nor was Kuumba embraced by the student body, Sowell explains. She recounts how at her 40th reunion in 2013, she spoke with non-black students from her class, and most had no knowledge of Kuumba.
Sowell says that she and her classmates were “astounded” to find out that one of the group’s concerts was named after Archie C. Epps, who was the Dean of Students at Harvard from 1971 to 1999, because he had not been supportive of Kuumba. She explains, “His philosophy was that we should come to Harvard and blend in, that we shouldn’t be on campus to do something black.”
Political Roots
From the start, political engagement was central to Kuumba. On May 16, 1971, Kuumba Singers, which then had 39 members, held their first spring concert, entitled “An Evening of Black Spirituality,” in Sanders Theatre. Members stood at the door of the theater and did not allow any white people to enter. They also placed black blindfolds over the eyes of white statues outside the theater. Sowell explains that the goal was to secure a time for “something within our own community, for our own community.”
Fields says, “It was very much this message: ‘We are carving out a space for ourselves at this place that doesn’t want us here.’”
This trend of political engagement continued the following decade, with Kuumba singers performing before and after an anti-apartheid protest on Harvard’s campus in 1985. Lin describes how in the ’80s, there was a national movement of multiculturalism and assimilation that made its way to Harvard. In the ’70s, there had been many initiatives designed to help foster a black community at Harvard, such as a pre-frosh week devoted specifically to black students.
In 1981, the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations was founded. Funding that had previously gone towards black initiatives were now funneled to this new foundation. The pre-frosh week for black students was discontinued, and there was an attempt to get rid of the African and African-American Studies department, Kuumba alumnus Curtis Hairston ’84 explains in an interview with Lin conducted by Kuumba as part of an oral history project. Hairston says black students were supportive of funding interactive events, but not the the exclusivity of activities targeted at black students. Kuumba members led and were involved in protests of this shift in support, including the boycotting of the Harvard Foundation.
More recently, the group participated in the Trayvon Martin rally in Harvard Square in March of 2012. “We’re less political,” Williams says, “but we still have that spirit that leads us to stand up for the rights of black people this century.”
A Musical Palette
Kuumba has always performed songs from a wide variety of genres. Williams explains that at a concert, they perform spirituals, contemporary gospel, and one piece from somewhere else in the diaspora such as jazz, reggae, or blues. “Kuumba was a palette upon which all this kind of music could be presented,” Sowell says.
The music is rooted in a historical, religious, and cultural context, expressing the experiences of black people who lived through slavery, through civil rights, and through more contemporary black experiences. These songs were born out of struggle, Lin says. “They were what was sung in the fields.”
The students also explain that the group chooses songs that celebrate the diverse cultural heritages of the members. “We try to be as inclusive as possible when it comes to expressing black creativity and spirituality,” Williams says. At the most recent anniversary concert in 2010, the group performed a song in Igbo, a language spoken by the Igbo people of Nigeria, because their assistant director was Igbo.
The Kuumba Community
Kuumba has never had auditions, so from the very beginning any student could come join the group regardless of their singing abilities—and members do not need to be enrolled in Harvard College. Students from other schools as well as Boston and Cambridge residents have been part of Kuumba since it was founded. “It’s been open to anyone if they want to celebrate the black experience,” says Dennis J. Henderson ’79, a former president of the Kuumba Singers.
In the mid-’70s, several Latino students wanted to join the choir. There was some initial conflict around the matter, although the students were ultimately accepted into the group. Although some members appreciated solidarity, Fields explains, other members worried that the comfort level of the community could be damaged with the inclusion of those “who aren’t from those experiences and don’t have direct contact with the issues that we struggle with.”


Sowell, who had already graduated by the time non-black students joined the choir, explains her surprise on hearing of this change: “Our visions didn’t include that.” But she describes how Kuumba provides an anchor through the spiritual connections within the group and with God, and asks, “Why shouldn’t it be an anchor that would be valued by more than the African American students on campus?”
Hairston recalls when a white female student wanted to join the choir when he was a member. The ultimate consensus, he says, was that “anybody can join the choir as long as they share the focus and goals of the organization.”
The group “began as a community, and we still really are a community first,” Fields says. In fact, sometimes the group is even a family, members explain, as there are currently many “kuumbabes” in the choir: students whose parents met through Kuumba. “Many of our children followed us to Harvard,” Sowell says, “and most of them also join Kuumba, which I think says a lot.”
A Necessity
For Kuumba members today, the history of the group lives on. The Kuumba office in the SOCH is full of relics from the past, with old photos, posters, and quotations from old members lining the walls, and binders of old concert tickets and news clips. Currently, Lin is spearheading a project to write a book about Kuumba’s history.
“So much of black history is not documented and not kept up with,” Fields says. “It’s amazing that we have this ability to reach back, and look at what happened forty-some odd years ago.”
Fields explains how her mother was telling her that at the beginning, the members “were just trying to get to the next day—they had no idea that this thing they created would last 44 years.”
Though many things have changed since 1971, Williams says that being a black student at Harvard remains a defining experience. He says Kuumba has shown him “a dimension of my life that [he] wasn’t even aware of.”
As Williams explains, “Kuumba was and still is a necessity for black students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Upperclassmen who applied to the first round of the interhouse transfer process received the results of their applications last week and some have since voiced concerns and complaints about the process.
Many transfer applicants received an email from Sophia R. Chaknis, director of residential programs and operations, informing them that their attempt to transfer was denied.
Chaknis declined to share exact transfer application numbers.
“The lottery process is completely random with caps set on the number of students who can transfer in and out of each House,” Chaknis wrote.
Tiffany A. Lazo-Cedré ’16, a resident of Pforzheimer House, did not succeed in transferring from the Quad.
Although Lazo-Cedré noted that many students prefer to live in the Quad, she believes that many students may elect to transfer because the current housing system fails to consider student interests. She has found it difficult to attend late-night extracurricular meetings in River Houses.
“I think that’s why the transfer process becomes so competitive, because so many people apply, since many times they’re not happy with their housing,” she said.
According to the Office of Student Life website, students who are unsatisfied with their current housing assignments can choose to enter a random lottery and be placed into a new House. They must have lived in their current House for at least two terms before applying.
According to the same website, there are two rounds of the transfer applications for students who wish to switch at the beginning of the fall semester, and a single round to switch at the beginning of the spring semester. Unsuccessful applicants can apply again if they are denied permission to transfer the first time.
Transfer applicants have the option of applying on their own or joining with a friend to form a pair.
A sophomore transferring out of Cabot House, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the subject, said that, while she and a friend successfully applied to transfer to their top-choice River House, her blockmates were unsuccessful in their applications.
“[My blockmates and I] are currently trying to figure out round two transfers,” she said. “It’s a process that I wish didn’t have to happen, but for myself, I knew that I would be happier transferring.”
 
Regardless of whether or not their application succeeded, students voiced concerns over the transfer process.
“I think it’s a flawed system in the sense that it doesn’t really work to help the student, or understand the student and their need for housing,” Lazo-Cedré said. “I think there’s not enough support on campus for students who are transferring.”
She added that what she considered a lack of staff members well-versed in the details of the transfer system surprised her, and that the shortage of resources was something she found “very unlike Harvard.”
The sophomore transferring out of Cabot echoed Lazo-Cedré’s concerns and said that the culture surrounding the transfer process calls for improvement.
“I know that Harvard doesn’t necessarily encourage transferring, but if somebody wants to do it, I think that it needs to be a little more well-known and less frowned upon,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the announcement early Wednesday afternoon that the SAT will undergo major changes in coming years, the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid praised the revisions revealed for the popular standardized test, which other admissions experts cautioned raise many unanswered questions.
Beginning in the spring of 2016, the SAT will feature two mandatory sections: math and a new section called “Evidence-Based Reading and Writing,” which is meant to combine the existing writing and critical reading sections. The new SAT will also include an optional essay and will test students’ abilities to construct analytical arguments from provided material.
Currently, the SAT consists of three sections: critical reading, mathematics, and writing, which has both a multiple choice and a mandatory essay component. The highest possible score is 2400.
The revised SAT will revert back to its previous 1600-point score, which was last used in 2004. Students will no longer receive a penalty for wrong answers in the new version—a scoring system similar to that of the ACT.
The new math section will draw from fewer topics, namely those that “most contribute to student readiness for college and career training,” according to the College Board.
The new combined reading and writing section will replace obscure SAT vocabulary words with words, such as “synthesis” and “empirical,” that are more commonly seen in college and the workplace. Reading selections will additionally feature a wide range of topics, such as science, history, and social studies.
 
In addition, at least one of the reading selections will feature a passage from an American “Founding Document,” such as The Declaration of Independence, or a text from “Great Global Conversation,” such as a selection from Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr’s “I Have a Dream” speech.
Parke P. Muth, a former associate dean of admissions and director of international admissions at the University of Virginia, said that the proposed changes in the SAT coincide with a combination of concerns over the test, including the College Board losing the market share to the ACT, the income disparities in scores, and the questionable power of the SAT to predict college success.
 
“If you’ve made the test somewhat easier in terms of what you are studying for...but if it’s easier, does that mean more people will get a higher score? And if not, will you still have the same distribution?” said Muth, who now runs his own college consulting company and blog.
Muth added that it is also unclear whether the revised SAT’s reading sections will benefit American students or provide more global documents so that international test takers will not be at a disadvantage.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, who chaired a committee that offered specific recommendations on standardized testing to the College Board in 2008, praised the proposed reforms.
“These reforms send an important signal to high school students across America,” wrote Fitzsimmons in an email to the Crimson. “If you work hard in the classroom on a daily basis, you will significantly improve your chances of doing well on the SAT, getting into the college of your choice, graduating and succeeding in your chosen career. Most important of all, you will be better able to embrace learning in all its forms, from the humanities to the social sciences, the natural sciences, engineering and mathematics.”
Fitzsimmons also lauded the College Board for considering the recommendations that he and his committee offered, noting that the changes to the SAT could have a global impact.
“I want to commend David Coleman and the College Board for implementing a number of the specific recommendations included in our 2008 report on the use of standardized tests in undergraduate admissions,” Fitzsimmons wrote.  “These changes will enable us better to educate and inspire future citizens and leaders of the nation and the world."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Committee for Undergraduate Education considered four proposals to improve the academic experience at the College during a meeting Wednesday, including one to extend the pass/fail deadline further into the semester.
The proposals, made by the Undergraduate Council Education Committee, specifically asked CUE to consider moving the pass/fail deadline from the fifth to the seventh Monday of the semester, as well as to consider implementing a mid-semester faculty evaluation and grade report.
The UC Education Committee also asked for faculty members to list the cost of course materials on their syllabi, though many meeting attendees considered the proposal unfeasible.
Assistant Dean of the College Sue Brown said in an interview Wednesday evening that she thought the proposal to change the pass/fail deadline “garnered the most traction” at the meeting.
“There is an impression on one hand that [extending the pass/fail deadline] is really motivated by students checking their GPA,” Brown said. “But I think there are other considerations that are also an important part of the conversation, like someone who has really taken a risk by taking a class and doesn’t know how things will turn out.”
Jeffrey A. Miron, the director of undergraduate studies in the Economics Department, agreed with Brown, saying that the pass/fail extension was the most feasible option and “least controversial” proposal the UC Education Committee offered.
 
“I think it is fairly simple and inexpensive to implement,” Miron said during an interview.
Miron also noted that he would need more data from the committee in order to approve the other proposals such as the suggestion to list the cost of course materials on syllabi.
 
Brown also warned against focusing on grades and grade point averages when pursuing proposals, such as extending the add/drop deadline and implementing a mid-semester grade report, which may affect a student’s course selection.
 
Instead, Brown recommended that the UC committee concentrate its efforts on improving students’ learning experience.
 
“[The Education Committee] should really focus on learning outcomes, and how these [proposals] will positively affect learning outcomes,” Brown said. “There needs to be an honest conversation with all members of the University on what is good work, and what do grades really mean.”
Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, the chair of the UC Education Committee, said the debate over the value of learning as opposed to the value of a grade was something that the his committee will take into consideration while moving forward with its proposals. He also noted that one of the committee’s first steps will to be to re-evaluate the significance of a letter grade at the College.
“Are grades a means of comparison, or are they a means of testing your mastery of the material?” Goyal said in an interview.
In addition to debating the four proposals, members of the Committee on Undergraduate Education discussed how to improve the quality of Harvard’s Q Guide and the advantages and drawbacks of capping section size.

The Graduate Student Council unanimously passed a resolution Wednesday evening pledging to support workers at the DoubleeTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Boston if they decide to call for a boycott of the hotel, which is housed in a University-owned building in Allston.
The resolution, which is nearly identical to one passed by the Undergraduate Council earlier this week, calls upon the graduate body to urge relevant Harvard administrators to support fair process as workers decide whether or not to unionize.
According to Gabriel H. Bayard ’15, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement who spoke at the regularly scheduled GSC meeting Wednesday evening, some DoubleTree workers plan on asking potential patrons to boycott the hotel on March 27.
“I think the resolution itself was well composed, completely sound, and reasonable,” said Summer A. Shafer, president of the Graduate Student Council.
Bayard said that he was “ecstatic” at the outcome of the vote.
“We think this symbolizes that the Harvard community is behind [the Student Labor Action Movement],” he said.
 
SLAM’s next step is to solicit support from more student groups, according to member Zoe A. Onion. A SLAM press release Wednesday said that the GSC joins 16 other student groups in endorsing the DoubleTree workers’ demands.
The group said it plans to meet with Harvard Labor Relations Director Bill Murphy within the next month to discuss the matter.
After the resolution passed, Shafer applauded the council for its action.
“I think everyone in this room should pat themselves on the back,” Shafer said to a crowd of more than 70 people.
 The resolution was presented to the council after a speech by DoubleTree worker Sandra Hernandez, who discussed her personal financial situation with those in attendance.
Hernandez, who spoke to the group with the aid of a translator, described her own inability to afford healthcare for members of her family on her current salary. She said she has worked at the hotel for 22 years.
“I think having a worker present made it a living, breathing issue and not an abstract intellectual exercise,” said Shafer, who teared up while reading the resolution aloud. “It affected me very personally and deeply because what they’re doing is incredibly brave and what they’re facing is incredibly harsh.”
The meeting also featured a number of smaller discussion items, including the formation of an ad hoc committee on Dudley Cafe and the approval of funding for graduate student groups.

News anchor Candy A. Crowley was awarded the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism during a ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Thursday evening.
Crowley hosts the CNN program “State of the Union with Candy Crowley” and has also moderated a 2012 presidential debate.
Alex S. Jones, director of the Shorenstein Center on the Media, Politics, and Public Policy, called Crowley “one of the savviest and most decisive political analysts on the air.”
During her acceptance speech, Crowley emphasized her concerns about journalism today as it comes to terms with the advent of the internet and social media. While she praised the internet for its unprecedented dissemination of news, Crowley also said that she was skeptical about whether it was being used effectively.
“I think [the internet] is an amazing tool that we now have in front of us that opens up so much information and so many forums for people to talk and speak and discuss,” Crowley said. “But I think as far as journalism is concerned, I worry that so far the internet has mastered us, rather than us mastering the internet.”
Crowley said that over the last two decades she has seen the pressure for news organizations to produce breaking news articles rapidly increase.
“I worry that the speed of social media is pressuring daily news into putting something out before it actually passes what used to be really stringent rules,” she told the crowded forum.
Crowley is the 23rd recipient of Goldsmith Career Award. She follows last year’s winner, Nicholas D. Kristof ’81, a New York Times columnist and former Crimson news editor.
 
The Shorenstein Center also awarded the Goldsmith Book Prize and the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting Monday evening.
 
The Book Prizes were awarded to four authors: Matthew S. Levendusky for his book “How Partisan Media Polarize America,” Jaron Lanier for “Who Owns the Future?” and Kevin Arceneaux and Martin Johnson for “Changing Minds or Changing Channels: Partisan News in an Age of Choice.”
 
The Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting went to a team of ABC News reporters for their article “Breathless and Burdened: Dying from Black Lung, Buried by Law and Medicine.”
 
According to a press release last month, the Investigative Reporting Prize carries a $25,000 award, while the finalists receive a prize of $10,000.

President Barack Obama attended a roundtable discussion with Democratic Party supporters Wednesday afternoon at the Charles Hotel, where he was met by demonstrators from the Harvard Ukrainian Students Association and the Harvard Global Health and AIDS Coalition.
 
Supporters of Russian occupation in Crimea made a brief appearance, as well, but had no organized rally.
Both groups of active demonstrators have recently been affected by White House action.
Ukrainian students said they were rallying behind the administrationafter Secretary of State John Kerry used what some consider pro-Ukrainian rhetoric during an appearance at the U.S. embassy in Kiev.
AIDS awareness groups, on the other hand, were angered yesturday by the release of the fiscal year 2015 federal budget, which alls for a $400 million cut in funding to the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief.
Obama’s meeting was closed to the public, keeping protestors on the streets surrounding the Charles Hotel.
The President, a 1991 graduate of Harvard Law School, left promptly after the event ended to deliver an address and take questions at a private Democratic National Committee meeting at the Artists for Humanity EpiCenter in the Seaport District. Obama, who arrived at the Charles Hotel just before 5 p.m., had arrived at his second event soon after 6:30 p.m.
Streets were closed off to vehicles around the John F. Kennedy School of Government from 4 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. because of the Presidential motorcade. 
Oleh Kotsyuba, a Ph.D. candidate in Slavic languages and literatures and online editor of a Ukrainian intellectual journal called Krytyka, was at the rally with members of the Harvard Ukrainian Students Association. He expressed gratitude for the Obama administration's support of a free Ukraine.
“We also want to emphasize sanctions for Putin to prevent war in Ukraine,” he said. “Many of us have families in Southern Ukraine. We are extremely worried it will come to bloodshed.”
The Ukrainian demonstration was organized by The Ukraine Group of Boston, and was the seventh rally organized in the area in response to Russia’s invasion of Crimea.
“This is the least we can do for our brothers and sisters in the Ukraine” said rally organizer Ilya Timtchenko.
Both groups found out late last night that the President would be visiting Cambridge, and quickly organized demonstrations to be held across from the Charles Hotel.
Ukrainian flags were distributed throughout the crowd and protesters chanted phrases that included “Pressure on Putin” and ”Slava Ukraine! Heroyam Slava!” which translates to “Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Heroes!”
 
Other demonstrators held pro-PEPAR paraphernalia.
“We threw some signs together, recycled some old ones, grabbed some bed sheets, and made this happen,” GHAC member Eudora Olsen ’17 said. “[AIDS has] sort of fallen off the radar and we’re trying to bring attention back to it.”
As the founding chapter of the Student Global Aids Campaign, GHAC is among the most active branches it the organization nationwide. It recently organized a walkout against House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in response to his refusal to fund a syringe exchange program.
 
Yet, according to GHAC member India Perez-Urbano ’16, Wednesday was a particularly opportune moment to hold a demonstration.
“We don’t get many opportunities like this,” Perez-Urbano said. “We just want [Obama] to see our message.”
Amirah Sequeira, the national coordinator for the Student Global Aids Campaign who attended the rally, also called for Obama to return to supporting an AIDS free generation.
 
“Today’s demonstration is focused on the President’s budget cuts that were released yesterday,” Sequeira said. “The number of people receiving treatment around the world is going to greatly decrease. It affects millions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About a month after an undergraduate died in a car crash while returning to campus from an out-of-state mock trial competition, College administrators will convene a working group to examine the challenges surrounding student group transportation.
According to Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, the Office of Student Life is in the process of soliciting participation in the working group, looking to involve voices from club sports teams and other student organizations whose members travel domestically.
Friedrich said he hopes that the group will begin its work “quite quickly,” likely meeting in late March and early April with the goal of bringing the results of its work to the Committee on Student Life before the end of the semester. The student group transportation issue came up at the committee’s most recent meeting on Feb. 20. At that meeting, committee members expressed support for putting together a working group to address the issue.
The move to begin formal discussion on student group transportation comes after several members of the Harvard Mock Trial Association were injured while driving back from a competition in Virginia early in the morning of Feb. 10. Angela R. Mathew ’15, a Leverett House resident, died in the crash.
“The accident was a terrible tragedy and has deeply affected our community,” Friedrich said. “This is an opportunity for us to really understand more about the challenges that student groups face when they travel and to see what more we can do to help support those student organizations as they travel, with education and best practices.”
According to Friedrich, there are about 100 student organizations at the College, not including club sports teams, whose members travel. He said that student organizations face several challenges while arranging for travel, funding among them. Friedrich said he is “quite certain” that funding will be a part of the conversation.
 
Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde said that administrators hope to learn about how peer institutions approach the student transportation issue, both with regard to guidelines or restrictions and to funding.
Undergraduate student leaders have pushed to make student group funding more generally a topic of debate at the College this semester. The Undergraduate Council, which is also involved in the discussion about the transportation working group, just last month began a social media campaign calling for administrators to increase its budget—the majority of which is allocated to recognized student groups—by $250,000.
 
Though the UC’s grant program does not directly fund transportation costs incurred by non-athletic student groups, the UC does partially support club sports teams’ travel costs through grant funding. However, due to its stagnant budget and an increase in the number of groups applying for funding, the Council could not fully meet the grant request of any club sports team last fall.
“I think the College does have some responsibility towards making sure that students are able to travel to the events that they want to go to for their extracurricular activities, and that the College should help secure transportation that enables students to both have great experiences but also to be safe,” said UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15, who has made student group funding a signature issue of his presidency.
Lassonde said it is unlikely that it would be feasible for the College to undertake funding student group travel “very extensively,” saying that funding the travel expenses of every student group would be “astronomical.”
“None of us really has the budget to sponsor all student travel, so we have to figure out what we can do to support them without going that far,” Lassonde said.
 
Currently, student groups can apply for the College to fund domestic travel to one-time conferences and competitions through the Dean of Harvard College's Student Life Fund.
“[Travel grant funding] is intended for one‐time unique opportunities afforded through special invitation, qualification, or similar circumstance, and it should not be relied upon as an annual funding source for the same event,” according to a description of the Fund’s travel grant guidelines posted on the OSL’s website. The Student Life Fund, which had $50,000 available this academic year, also funds special events hosted by House Committees, such as House formals.

British fashion model, actress, and social entrepreneur Lily L. Cole is working to make the impossible possible with the U.S. launch of her London-based social media site and application called Impossible.
Cole, who spoke at a panel discussion Wednesday at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, said she launched Impossible to change the culture of wish-making.
Impossible is both a website and an app that resembles a combination of Pinterest and Twitter. Registered users post their wishes or their skills in the hopes finding a match and making a wish come true, thereby promoting altruism and changing the norms of reciprocity.
After researching the concepts of what she called a “gift economy,” Cole said Impossible was created with the intention of battling paradigms of exchange.
“A gives to B because B might need it and A can do it. Trusting that if everyone gives, inevitably, everyone will give and receive,” Cole said during the discussion. “That’s the kind of world I would definitely like to be a part of.”
Cole’s said that her desire to merge the idea of giving and receiving into one natural practice has gradually become a reality now that Impossible users are not only wishing to be helped but wishing to be able to help someone.
Impossible launched in England in November and currently has 25,000 members.
Cole discussed the benefits and challenges of Impossible with Jonathan L. Zittrain, director of the Berkman Center and Harvard Law School professor, and Sir Tim J. Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web Foundation.
“I don’t think the Internet is naturally primed for altruism but with that said...things we build on top of the web can be, so more power to Impossible,” Berners-Lee said.
Zittrain also expanded on the strengths and weaknesses of the application.
  
“Impossible is aspirational, incomplete, and will only work if there is a mass of people that want to inhabit it,” Zittrain said.
During the event, a woman in the audience admitted that she might be the only person in the room who had never been on Twitter or Facebook, but she had one wish: to take a sip of Cole’s water bottle. Cole immediately left the panel to give her the water.
Cole said that she hopes good deeds like that one will become more common as a result of her website.
“It will be interesting to see if this idea can move into the physical world,” said a researcher at the Graduate School of Design who attended the panel.
In response to a question from Urs Gasser, executive director of the Berkman Center and moderator of the panel, Cole said her one wish is to be surprised.

U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara ’90 and actress Mindy Kaling will speak at Harvard Law School’s Class Day, the Law School announced Wednesday.
 
Bharara, who prosecuted Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad, was nominated by Obama and unanimously confirmed by the Senate in 2009 as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.
 
Bharara had previously served as a the chief counsel and staff director of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts.
 
Time Magazine named him one of the most influential people in the world in 2012.
 
After graduating magna cum laude with a degree in government from Harvard in 1990, Bharara earned his J.D. from Columbia Law School in 1993.
 
At the age of 24, Kaling started helping write scripts for the NBC sitcom "The Office" and played the role of Kelly Kapoor on the show. By 2011, Kaling had written 22 episodes of the Emmy-winning sitcom and earned the rank of executive producer.
 
Known as both an actress and a comedic writer, Kaling has had roles in "The 40 Year Old Virgin," "Despicable Me," and "No Strings Attached," among other movies.
 
In 2013, Kaling was also recognized by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.
 
Kaling, a Cambridge native, graduated from Dartmouth College in 2001 with a degree in playwriting.
 
The speakers were selected by the class marshals—Arvind V. Sohoni, Connie P. Sung, Eric M. Jordan, and Andrew J. Chinsky—after consulting with the Law School’s Class of 2014.
 
“We know that both will inspire us, and both will provide us with insight as to how we can make a positive and meaningful difference in the world as we graduate and embark on our new careers,” the class marshals wrote in an email.
 
Class Day is Wednesday, May 28, with Commencement ceremonies taking place the following day.

Former Insomnia Cookies employees who went on strike against the company last August after alleging unfair working conditions reached a settlement with the company Tuesday.
The workers, who brought forth charges with the National Labor Relations Board, will be compensated with payback totaling more than $4,000 and will have their terminations rescinded from their records. 
In addition, the settlement requires Insomnia Cookies to hang a poster in their Harvard Square location stating the company is union-neutral and will not fire workers for union activity, according to an Industrial Workers of the World press release Wednesday.
“Once we heard about the settlement, I was stoked because we actually made them pay up for what they owed us,” former Insomnia worker and striker Jonathan Peña said.
Peña and three of his fellow workers, Chris Helali, Niko Stapczynski, and Luke Robinson, went on strike over working conditions at Insomnia Cookies, claiming they were being paid below minimum wage, were not allowed breaks, and were forced to work long hours.
"I had something to lose, but I put it in my head that I didn’t really care because I was standing up for something,”  Peña said.
Management fired all four workers immediately after they went on strike. The workers subsequently joined the Industrial Workers of the World union, which helped them appeal to the National Labor Relations Board. Industrial Workers of the World also helped them start an advocacy campaign, which included pickets and boycotts to spread their cause to the broader community.
“We found out from contacts inside the store that the campaign—between the picketing and boycotts—was definitely hurting their business,” said Industrial Workers of the World delegate Geoff Carens, who is also a Harvard library assistant.
 
Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement took to the cause by leading a petition for students to boycott the cookie company, which received hundreds of signatures. Students also teamed up with students from Boston University, Industrial Workers of the World, and the Insomnia Cookie strikers for pickets, marches, rallies, forums, and phone blitzes to generate enthusiasm for their cause.
 
“[Insomnia is] a business so affected by Harvard students,” Student Labor Action Movement member Zoe A. Onion ’17 said. “We realized that we had the capacity to change these [strikers’] lives.”
 
The collective effort by many in the Cambridge community contributed to the success in the settlement, Carens said. He credits much of the efforts to Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement.
 
“I’m grateful that Harvard students care enough about service workers to take action,” Carens said.
 
Peña added that Insomnia Cookie workers and advocates plan to continue their fight for fair wages and better working conditions.
 
“It’s still going to be a continuing fight with them until they treat workers right,” he said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 6, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the labor union which the former employees of Insomnia Cookies joined upon their termination. In fact, the four former employees joined the Industrial Workers of the World, not the International Workers of the World.

Few members of On Harvard Time, one of Harvard’s on-campus comedy groups, are laughing as they make final preparations to relocate to the Student Organization Center at Hilles this month after being “kicked out” of their Pforzheimer basement studio.
Julianna R. Aucoin ’16, an executive producer of the show, said OHT have been in conversations with Pforzheimer House Masters Anne Harrington ’82 and John R. Durant about a potential relocation since early in the year. According to Aucoin, Harrington and Durant had made it clear to the club that the basement studio would no longer solely house OHT, which has recorded seven seasons of comedy news to date.
Harrington wrote in an email to The Crimson that she and her husband have met with OHT senior members and Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich  to discuss the terms of sharing the basement space, which would serve as not only a studio but also a “multi-use party room and social space.”
“We invited OHT to stay,” Harrington wrote. “However, we said that we would like to transform the large and attractive common room space it had been using into a shared, multi-use space, rather than a space to which OHT would have exclusive access.”
Aucoin said that with a production that requires editing, filming, and script writing at all hours of the day, sharing the space would be far from ideal and that while she appreciates help with the relocation, she still feels that OHT had been essentially “kicked out” of its studio.
“We feel very much powerless, and it is quite irritating,” Aucoin said.
She added that the staff now has to focus on the logistics and finances of relocation, distracting members from their production duties.
“[We are] flakey arts kids, people who are more interested in jokes and laughing,” Aucoin said. “Now we are having to navigate the structure of the University and attempt to get funding...and manage a situation we might not be qualified to manage.”
Despite the distraction, though, Aucoin said that OHT was able to produce its fifth episode of the current season, set to go online Friday, that will poke fun at them being “kicked out” of their studio. It will likely be the final episode filmed in their current location.
Derek M. Flanzraich ’10, who founded OHT in 2007, said that the relocation of OHT hurts a production that has a beneficial role in the community.
“[OHT] pokes fun at a University and a student body that sometimes does not remember to laugh enough,” Flanzraich said.
In addition, he noted that while he has confidence that current OHT members will be able to handle the move, the character of the club will inevitably be harmed.
“It is extraordinarily hard to produce something like that.... I think it is a shame that [OHT] doesn’t get the recognition that it deserves and protection from the administration,” Flanzraich said. “I do think the current group will figure it out, but I do think it will never be the same. I think that [this] is a mistake.”

For freshmen living in Grays, Weld, and Matthews, late night dining just became way more convenient. This is all thanks to InstaNomz, a new on campus start-up that originated as CS50 final project. InstaNomz launched last Sunday, delivering food--for a fee ranging between $1 and $10--to freshmen in Elm Yard from three beloved late night spots: Felipe’s, Pinocchio’s, and Shake Shack.This fall, founders Akshar Bonu ’17 and Fanele S. Mashwama ’17 noticed the lack of food delivery service in the Square and recognized that in winter students were eager for their favorite nighttime snacks, but reluctant to venture out into the cold. Along with Raul E. Jordan ’17, who worked on website design, and Lance B. Katigbak ’16, business associate, the founders created a site and crafted an organized delivery plan.In an emailed statement, Bonu noted that the first few days had been “an incredible experience” and that he was satisfied with the demand for the service. As for what’s next, he wrote that “Right now, we’re looking to generate capital and also look for mentors. We started with a few dorms because we didn’t know what to expect…but it’s clear there is something here and now it’s time to really nail down a logistical model that lends itself to scaling the idea.”Pleased with the inaugural weekend of InstaNomz, Bonu has high hopes for the future. “We see this expanding to the entirety of Harvard College and possibly Harvard University. Then, we can look into expanding this model to other universities in Cambridge, Boston, and Massachusetts. After that we don’t really know. Hopefully, one day this can become something like the Amazon, UPS, FedEx of food delivery,” he said in his email.
Given Harvard students’ eating habits (midnight meals = the norm) and the general unwillingness to venture out in the frigid New England climate, we wouldn't be surprised if more and more students start InstaNomz-ing soon!

You can cross your fingers, burn a boat, or take shots along the river, but no one outwits the Housing Gods.
Major changes are in the works for the SAT, according to an announcement made by David Coleman, president of The College Board, early Wednesday afternoon.
Beginning in the spring of 2016, the SAT will feature two mandatory sections instead of the current three: Math and a new section called “Evidence-Based Reading and Writing,” which is meant to be a conglomeration of the existing Writing and Critical Reading sections. An optional essay will also be on the new SAT, and will test student’s abilities to construct analytical arguments around given material.
In addition, the SAT will revert back to its old 1600-scaled score and students will receive no penalty for wrong answers.
The new math section will draw from fewer topics, and namely those that “evidence shows most contribute to student readiness for college and career training,” according to The College Board. Calculators will now only be allowed for certain parts of the math sections.
The new reading and writing section will replace formerly obscure SAT vocabulary words with ones that are more commonly seen in college and in the workplace. Reading selections will additionally feature a wide range of topics, including science, history, and social studies. At least one of the reading selections will feature a passage from an American “Founding Document,” such as The Declaration of Independence, or a “Great Global Conservation,” such as a selection from Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr’s “I Have a Dream” speech.
Questions in the reading and writing section will also ask students to support their answers with direct reference to the passages.
The College Board has made preparations to partner with Khan Academy to provide free online test preparation material and will allow students to take the revised SAT in paper or digital form.
Though the changes will not go into effect until 2016, The College Board has already released official information about what the revised SAT means for students.
Feel free to share your own impressions of the changes in the SAT in the comments below.
For students who are planning to take the SAT starting spring 2016, we have great news: The College Board just announced great changes to the structure and format of the infamous exams. For those who read the news and still don’t understand what it exactly means, here is a breakdown of some of the most important changes:
No more guessing penalty: Under the old system, every multiple-choice question you got wrong meant a quarter of a point subtracted from your overall score. Now, future test-takers don’t have to feel that sort of pressure.  No longer will playing “eeny, meeny, miny, moe” between two possible answers feel like a life-or-death situation. Only have a few of minutes left and a bunch of questions unanswered? Feel free to fill in those pesky bubbles. Go wild.
Vociferous vocabulary: The SAT is known for its use of somewhat outrageous vocabulary words in its Critical Reading section. Now, you don’t have to know or even care for the definition of the word “raconteur” or “sagacious”. Instead they plan to focus on words you would actually use in college. I expect the most popular words would be “thesis,” “freshman fifteen” and “problem set.”
Optional Essay: You will no longer be forced to write a somewhat coherent essay in twenty five minutes about a topic you probably know nothing about. Some colleges may still require you to take it, but the good news is that you get to read someone else’s text and critique their style.  If you don’t need to write an essay, you won’t have to waste time scribbling illegible words as fast as you can.
Mind-numbing Math: With the new changes, the math section would have topics focusing on things like linear equations, proportional reasoning and complex equations.  What that means is that you don’t have to remember concepts from geometry that you learned in the tenth grade. You don’t have to remember how to calculate the volume of a sphere or terms like the “orthocenter.”
For those lucky individuals who get to take this revised exam, please feel sorry for those students who came before you. We can’t even sell our old SAT prep books to you anymore.
