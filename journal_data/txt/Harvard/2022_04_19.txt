Hundreds of Harvard students flocked to Tercentenary Theater on April 16 to witness live music’s return to Harvard Yard as Swae Lee headlined the first in-person Yardfest since 2019.
The event was a return to tradition for Harvard students new and old alike. While Yardfest was held virtually in 2021, featuring artists Aminé and Trevor Daniel, it failed to match the excitement of its in-person counterpart.
“It just doesn’t feel the same,” said Isha Agarwal ’24, the director of the College Events Board’s Arts and Entertainment Committee, about virtual concerts.
This year, the committee sought to bring high energy back to Yardfest for its grand return. “We were looking for a good performer, someone who is super high energy, and has a lot of exciting and upbeat songs that can really get the crowd going,” said Agarwal. Finding such an artist proved to be a difficult task for the committee. The selected artists had to appeal to a wide audience while remaining in-budget and musically distinct across the event.
For the headliner, Swae Lee fit the bill. Bringing his unique blend of hip hop, trap, and pop melodies, he was sure to offer something for every audience member despite their different tastes in music. The artist is most well known for his work as one half of the hip hop duo Rae Sremmurd, a project in collaboration with his brother Slim Jxmmi. For Yardfest, Swae Lee performed both Rae Sremmurd hits like “Come Get Her” and “Black Beatles,” as well as solo collaborations like 2018 crowd favorite “Sunflower” with Post Malone.
“It was a very intimate concert experience, which I’ve never had before,” said Raina Cohen ’24 about Lee’s Yardfest performance at Tercentenary Theater.
Throughout the performance Swae Lee leaned into the Harvard experience, coining himself “Professor Swae.” Fittingly, he reminded students in the audience to stay in school and continue working hard. He even lectured the audience on his hopes for a brighter future with Harvard students as the next generation of leaders.
Dutch DJ Sam Feldt acted as the celebrity opener, performing a high-energy EDM set to warm up the audience. Feldt stuck to a collection of crowd-pleasers, remixing hit songs like Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Start Now,'' David Guetta’s “Titanium” featuring Sia, and “Something Just Like This” by Coldplay and The Chainsmokers. He also mixed in some of his own tracks, including 2020’s “Hold Me Close” featuring Ella Henderson, and his most recent release, “Follow Me” featuring Rita Ora.
In addition to the celebrity acts, Harvard’s own talent was on display throughout the day. Student bands Charles Revival and Yard Bops both played sets to open up the event after winning the opportunity through the College Events Board’s Battle for Yardfest competition that took place earlier this semester. “We’re really grateful for everyone coming out and supporting,” said Alexander K. Park ’23, a member of Yard Bops.
“It was really special for us because we had aspirations to open my freshman year,” said Park, citing how the pandemic had interrupted their first opportunity. “It felt like a really great way to see a culmination of a couple years' work come together.”
Yard Bops covered many bops in their set, adding their signature funk spin to a collection of pop classics. Highlights included covers of Silk Sonic’s “Skate,” a Lady Gaga mashup featuring “Bad Romance,” “Telephone,” and “The Edge of Glory,” and Earth Wind and Fire’s “September” — all of which were newly arranged by members of the group.
While student reactions to the music selections at Yardfest were generally positive, the same cannot be said for the concert-going experience. Several audience members noted the lack of mosh-pit etiquette among Harvard students in the crowd, citing an excess of pushing and shoving throughout the event.
“I thought the crowd was less enjoying music, more trying to shove each other,”said first-time Yardfest attendee Steven Cho ’24. It was an environment that “caused more people to worry about not falling or being injured,” Cho added.
There were multiple times when audience members fell to the ground, unable to get up without the help of others. Thankfully, Swae Lee seemed to be aware of the audience’s rowdiness. The artist paused on several occasions, asking the crowd to take a few steps back to prevent any audience members from being crushed by the masses.
Not only did it achieve the high-energy atmosphere organizers set out to accomplish, but this year’s Yardfest also marks a return to form for Harvard traditions more broadly. It brought together the Harvard community in a way that only live music can, reminding students to take a break from work and simply have fun.

In between taking center stage night after night of her worldwide Reunion Tour, indie rock icon Phoebe Bridgers released the single “Sidelines” on April 15. A quietly resolute statement of bravery written for the upcoming TV adaptation of Sally Rooney’s novel “Conversations with Friends,” Bridgers’ latest work rises to the forefront of her discography both on its own and in dialogue with her previous output.
Unlike the distant-sounding synths that mostly wander in cautious stepwise motion for the first 20 seconds, Bridgers almost immediately dares to take a dramatic vocal leap of a major seventh while singing, “I’m not afraid of anything at all,” making her bold claim all the more believable. The long string phrases sustaining her solemn, stoic tone resemble the orchestral arrangements on her most recent EP, “Copycat Killer.”
“Not a plane going down / In the ocean, I’m drowning,” Bridgers continues, before the strings swell into a chorus about how she used to “watch the world from the sidelines.” Since the 2020 release of her hit single “Kyoto,” which includes the lines “I wanted to see the world / Then I flew over the ocean / And I changed my mind,” she’s had another sea change thanks to a new relationship: “Had nothing to prove / Till you came into my life,” she admits twice during “Sidelines.”
On “I Know The End,” the apocalyptic finale of her critically beloved sophomore album “Punisher,” Bridgers took solace in finding “no place like my room” — but now, she realizes “what it feels like / To wanna go outside” as a violin soars toward the upper limit of its range.
The highest note melts right into the second verse, where Bridgers lists more former fears: “going back to school,” “getting older,” and “being alone / In a room full of people.” Before the last chorus, the instrumentals achieve an as-yet-unheard consonance, marking a vital point in Bridgers’ attempts to reach inner peace.
Even the outro’s moments of harmonic tension resolve quickly while Bridgers sings, “And I used to think / You could hear the ocean in a seashell,” a perspective that also applies to her music: To understand its power, you have to hear it for yourself.

Camila Cabello’s latest single “psychofreak” featuring WILLOW is upbeat and fun, but very repetitive without being catchy.
The song is under three and a half minutes with only two verses, a pre-chorus, chorus, and post-chorus. This means “psychofreak” feels more like a loop than a developed song. The two verses are lyrically pleasing, and the themes of dissociation and self-confidence are intriguing, but the delivery leaves a lot to be desired. This is unfortunate, considering both the song’s gentle driving beat and melodic sound design have a great deal of potential.
Though the verses are generally stronger than the bloated chorus, Cabello makes a Fifth Harmony call-out in the second verse that lacks substance. She sings, “Everybody says they miss the old me / I been on this ride since I was fifteen / I don’t blame the girls for how it went down, down.” While the song doesn’t obey a rigorous rhyme scheme, the near-rhyme of “fifteen” with “me,” works sonically but doesn’t exemplify masterful song-writing. The entry to this reference is natural as Cabello describing how she feels overwhelmed and disconnected from her old self is a recurring theme of the song, but referencing the gargantuan storm of drama and rumors surrounding Cabello’s departure from Fifth Harmony with the desultory repetition of “down” feels like a lazy grab for attention.
Unfortunately, Cabello’s lifeless vocal performance detracts from the song’s impact. Cabello has joined the popular trend of speak-singing, adopting a very flat, monotonous style for her delivery. Effortless is usually a compliment when used to describe someone’s singing, but here it just sounds dull. Her tone cancels out a lot of the work that the beat does and even sucks the track of fun and feeling. Considering Cabello is an accomplished vocalist, it’s a shame that there isn’t any evidence of that on this song. Hopefully the rest of her new album, “Familia,” will make up for this one song.
WILLOW’S feature is an excellent addition to a track that wouldn’t have had enough substance to exist on its own. Cabello’s melody is extremely mundane and subdued, so WILLOW’s emotive vocals are a welcome relief. Beyond ad libs, WILLOW’s part is unfortunately confined to the pre- and post-choruses — so it might have been effective if she had more time to highlight her unique voice on the track, but considering the repetitiveness of this song, it seems like that would be asking too much.
The solid lyrical choices and interesting sound production of “psychofreak” bode well for Cabello’s new album, but unfortunately it fails to wow.

“Write a lyric for the song only you can understand,” Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish sings in their 2015 single “Élan.” An ode to the endless possibilities of existence, this song invites the listener to write their own song of life by finding their individual key to happiness without being held back by others’ norms or opinions. Even seven years after the song’s initial release, its timeless message lives on: What better time to celebrate life than right now?
Nightwish is well known for fusing female operatic vocals of lead singer Floor Jansen with symphonic and folk instruments. This epic, theatrical atmosphere fortifies their complex, poetic lyrics that explore a variety of themes like fantasy, mythology, artistry, personal struggles, and human nature. “Élan” is a single from the band’s eighth album “Endless Forms Most Beautiful” which celebrates the beauty of existence, science, and reason. Less heavy than most of their tracks, both sonically and lyrically, the track can be categorized as folk-rock rather than metal.
The song starts with solitary uilleann pipes, the national bagpipe of Ireland, that introduce the song’s folk fantasy melody. Shortly after, guitars and percussion set in to form Nightwish’s signature sound. The second verse ends with the lyrics, “The cliffs unjumped, cold waters untouched / The elsewhere creatures yet unseen / Finally your number came up, freefall awaits the brave.” Nightwish conjures images of all the things the listener has yet to try in life, the things they have left unjumped, untouched, unseen. With lines like “freefall awaits the brave,” the lyrics simultaneously hint at the risks and rewards of leaving the safe harbor. This idea is reinforced by Floor’s breathy, playful melodic line that makes the listener want to jump up and dance.
The chorus adds male background vocals and fuller instrumentation as Floor sings, “Come, surf the clouds!” By now, the listener is already up and dancing to this unusually upbeat tune. Tuomas Holopainen’s brilliant songwriting shows when Floor invites the listener into the world of the song, “Meet me where the cliff greets the sea,” a reference to the earlier lyrics of “cliffs unjumped” and “waters untouched.” The song thus first hints at the listener’s unlived experiences before it explicitly calls on them to join Nightwish on their quest to seek out everything life has to offer.
Through the rest of the song, the intensity only increases. Two subsequent key changes in the bridge and the final chorus inject energy by raising it higher and higher, consistent with the idea that there is no limit to what people can do. The bridge, along with an addicting new melody, brings the liveliest lyrics of the song: “Riding hard every shooting star/Come to life, open mind, have a laugh at the orthodox/Come, drink deep let the dam of mind seep/Travel with great élan, dance a jig at the funeral, come!” “Come!” Nightwish sings, again and again. They want the listener to wish and dream big, to defy the norms of the orthodox. Although a tradition in other cultures, dancing a jig at a funeral is certainly not common in US (or Finnish) culture. These lyrics reveal the life-affirming meaning of the song: Precisely because we are only here for a short while, we should enjoy everything while it lasts. If we do not have to regret how we lived, then we do not have to fear death.

Translating a text from one language to another is doubtless a difficult undertaking for myriad reasons, but the reality of an untranslatable word or phrase presents perhaps the most thought-provoking dilemma for translators and linguists everywhere. Naturally, the central discourse concerning translated works regards textual fidelity. What should a translator prioritize in their work to make it most faithful to the original text? Meticulously preserving its word-for-word accuracy, or its connotational precision?
There is something intrinsically lost in translation in either case. If the words you are reading were not originally written in English, you have likely missed some parts of the original text through no fault of your own, nor of the translator’s. It is for this reason that we must be conscious of the translated books on our syllabi and bookshelves alike as slight distortions of their original works rather than as exact copies of them.
Without an English equivalent, even small, common phrases can rear large philosophical problems without clear answers for translators. While the French phrase “c’est la vie” literally means “this is the life,” a translation of “that’s life,” or even “it is what it is” in English might well serve as better translations of the same phrase given how it’s used in francophone countries. This distinction is often called that of connotation and denotation. A similar problem exists with words that seem to have obvious definitions across many different tongues too. One of the most beautiful facets of translation is that from a single text, many new interpretations, however slightly dissimilar, can arise.
The word “llegar” in Spanish could mean either to come, to arrive, or to reach one’s destination in English. Were two separate translators to approach this word, they would have a tough choice laid out before them in synonyms. Indeed, almost every word has a useful synonym within reach, and the very concept of a synonym implies an inherent, though slight, contrast between two or more words. Yet no matter how small the difference between these synonyms, our hypothetical translators would have each created a distinct text through their word choice. Despite their small size, the disparities between “to come” and “to arrive” can matter a great deal in the context of a 200-page work.
In Attic Greek, there are at least six different words for love, all connoting different meanings. The word “philia,” for instance, is translated in the “Liddell & Scott Greek-English Lexicon” as “friendly love” or “affection.” The word “agape” is given the similar though still distinct definition of “brotherly love” within the same text. In English, the word love — or friendship, were the author to choose the more granular option — would most likely be used to describe either of these phenomena, despite their differences. Through Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott’s translations of Classical Greek texts, it is especially clear that we miss certain characteristics of these concepts if we attempt to translate them using our closest single-word equivalents. Instead, adjectives must modify love, a near catch-all term for affection in the English language, to begin to describe the complex categories of this ideal detailed many centuries ago by the Ancient Greeks. What results is often a clunky and still inadequate substitute for the original term as deployed by such authors as Plato and Aristotle.
In an interview with “The New York Times,” Emily Wilson commented on the first line of her own translation of Homer’s “Odyssey.” She translates the Greek text as, “Tell me about a complicated man.” In the interview, however, Wilson said that she could have written instead, “Tell me about a straying husband,” due to certain other definitions contained within the connotations of a critical word in the sentence. Though within certain contexts, this is certainly a valid translation, Wilson herself admits the differences between the two sentences are vast. If each translation is easily justifiable, how can the reader know what the text’s first line truly connoted?
Many courses at Harvard use translated literature as central texts. By no means do I advocate for the omission of these texts from our syllabi; the act of translation is incredibly important to the democratization of literature and the arts at large. I do, however, hope that we can be mindful that many of the works we read in courses on world literature such as Humanities 10 — where I first encountered Wilson’s version of the “Odyssey” — are translated. When performing a close reading on such a text, we must recognize that the intent of the author and the intent of the translator may not align perfectly. The words Stuart Gilbert uses to capture those of Albert Camus in “The Stranger,” for example, are naturally colored by his interpretation of the work. His use of one English word as opposed to its synonym is almost certainly informed by his sense of the work’s meaning. And much like the relationship between a word and its synonym, no matter how close Gilbert’s understanding of “The Stranger” is to its author’s, he will not accurately capture everything Camus tried to convey through his own words in an English translation.
Recently, classical translation has become a particularly fashionable mode of writing due to the novelty any given translator can give to ancient words written by Homer, Horace, Sappho, or Sophocles. While some of Anne Carson’s translations in “If Not, Winter” may be more Carson than Sappho, it’s easy to admire Carson’s attempt to connect a new audience with ancient poetry. Additionally, attempting to translate Sappho’s poetry myself alongside Carson constituted some of the most fun and fulfilling extracurricular work I myself have completed all semester.
In many ways, the translation of a text is futile. No author’s words can be captured entirely honestly in a language other than that in which they were written. Certainly not in both their connotation and denotation. Yet the act of translation is beautiful. It is kind. It stretches across insurmountable divides and helps form a well-needed global community of readers. Fundamentally, a translator has read something that they found interesting and has decided to share it with a broader audience. To say, “Look. See how I loved this. I want you to love it too. Let me give it to you,” — What could be more human? Reading in translation is one of the most important ways we can connect with a broader, more diverse selection of readings than those with which we’ve grown up. If we recognize the inherent deficiencies of these translated texts on levels of both connotative and denotative accuracy, the consumption of translated texts can be a gorgeous cross-cultural exchange of knowledge that emphasizes both the differences and commonalities that fall across humanity.

Over the weekend of March 7, coffee professionals and enthusiasts from all over the world gathered in the colossal Boston Convention and Exhibition Center for the annual Specialty Coffee Expo. This year’s expo marked a return to the scale and breadth of pre-pandemic events for the first time in over two years. Hosted in a different city each year, the Specialty Coffee Expo is the largest gathering of specialty coffee professionals in the nation. From roastery engineers to branding designers, rural farmers to small coffee shop owners, every aspect of the coffee industry was represented at the convention. Lectures and workshops on topics ranging from food service incorporation to coffee roasting chemistry were available to all attendees, coffee professionals or not. More than 420 vendors and over 10,000 attendees visited the convention this year, bringing with them a diverse array of perspectives and experiences, all shaped in some way or another by the Covid-19 pandemic.
After postponing the in-person convention in 2021 and leaning into a hybrid option, 2022 was the closest to normal that the convention has seen in a while. A rigorous testing policy and mask-wearing recommendations helped ensure a safe return to connection and community within the world of coffee. The Covid-19 pandemic dealt a devastating blow to the coffee community, forcing many shops to close permanently and a lucky few to continue with mobile or to-go ordering. Nobody was left untouched by the economic shock: coffee farmers on the far reaches of the Earth were unable to sell their products and likewise coffee shops were unable to market it to a society, isolated and at home.
While the effects of the pandemic will be a part of everyday life for years to come, decreased case numbers and increased vaccine availability has allowed for a return to normal life, or rather a new normal. This optimism also applies to coffee. The Specialty Coffee Expo 2022 was a beautiful and passionate representation of the perseverance and emergence of coffee through the trials and tribulations of the Covid-19 pandemic.
One of the pillars of post-pandemic authenticity comes from the coffee farmers themselves. Spanning from Indonesia to Yemen, from the far reaches of the Ethiopian highlands to the rainforests of Brazil, coffee farmers from every coffee region of the world were present at the convention, proudly representing not only their beans but the culture that produces them. One such example was a coffee farm in Colombia called La Esperanza. La Esperanza’s representatives said that they were third-generation coffee farmers, representing not only their country but also their families’s heritage. Offering 11 different lots, or varietietals, of beans, La Esperanza yields some of the most successful South American beans on the market right now. Their geisha beans prove to be especially difficult to process, with a low crop yield and proclivity for misfermentation. Their natural processed geisha beans are few and far between in the specialty coffee market. La Esperanza claims they don't grow beans and offer the varietals because it’s easy, but because they want to be true to their farm and to their ancestors that came before them and spent decades nurturing the same plant they do. In pursuing the best beans that they can produce and choosing to stay close to their ideals of quality and authenticity, even at the cost of production value, farms like these are beacons of hope in an ever changing coffee industry. Excited to be able to sell their beans again, passionate farmers like those at La Esperanza represent the steadfast desire to remain true and authentic.
La Esperanza represents the earliest stage in the coffee production, but the shift to authentic, transparent production is present on the consumer side as well. Minor Figures is an oat milk company based out of London that has expanded into the U.S., trailblazing with an uncompromising commitment to remain true to their roots as baristas and, more importantly, coffee-lovers. Minor Figures makes oat milk by baristas for baristas.
In speaking with Alix Walper, the company’s Director of Foodservice Sales, she spoke of the brand’s ethos and what sets them apart from other oat milks in the increasingly flooded market of non-dairy milks. She said that first and foremost they produce oat milk that is as beautiful and as pure as can be, but also take every pain to ensure it’s just that: oat milk. She said that a lot of other non-dairy milks rely on a lot of smoke and mirrors, promising that their oat milk tastes exactly like milk, or that it has the exact same texture. She said that Minor Figures authentically makes really incredible oat milk that tastes exactly like oat milk, nothing less, nothing more.
Minor Figures has a very short ingredient list that stays true to their goal pursuing the best that oat milk can be instead of imitating what it isn’t. Alix said that their oat milk isn’t stark white because oats aren’t white, and oat milk shouldn’t have to be. Their business model and production is uncompromisingly honest, profoundly refreshing in a coffee market that is filled with artificial replacements fueled by hype.
From coffee farmers to oat milk millennials, the 2022 Specialty Coffee Expo was a delightful display of what coffee should look like after the pandemic. After spending so much time away from each other during the pandemic, coffee lovers took a step back and found what matters most to them. The many voices, companies, and perspectives represented at the Specialty Coffee Expo proved that coffee and its community remain true to their foundations while innovating towards an authentic, honest, and sustainable future for coffee.

“I really wanted to approach this as a love letter to ‘X-Files.’ It’s two agents from some secretive government who find themselves in a motel room, and they find out the motel room is carnivorous and is planning on eating them.”
To call the artistic vision of playwright Andrew Siañez-De La O unconventional would be a gross understatement. To write it off for the same reason, though, would be a gross mistake.
At a virtual event on Thursday, April 14, Siañez-De La O and his colleagues at Fresh Ink Theatre discussed their production, “Truth or Consequences.” Siañez-De La O was joined in conversation by Louise Hamill, Fresh Ink’s Artistic Director, as well as Jasmine Brooks, the Director of “Truth or Consequences.” The event, hosted by the Boston Center for the Arts, was part of a series of lunchtime talks the organization holds with its resident artists, including Fresh Ink Theatre.
True to its name, Fresh Ink Theatre is relatively fresh on the scene in Boston. And though the 11-year-old Fresh Ink may not be the largest theater company out there, Hamill believes that there are big benefits to being small.
“We’re working under a very small budget and a small capacity,” she said, “but therefore creating super cool work because we don’t have to deal with people that might put constraints on our work. And [we] can then truly make it as creative and expansive as possible.”
In keeping with Hamill’s description, Fresh Ink embraces such creativity in its production of “Truth or Consequences.”
“It’s not what it seems like it’s going to be,” said Brooks. “Though it is sci-fi, I feel like it’s using sci-fi elements to highlight toxic work environments, racism, colonialism, gentrification… There are so many topics that are being exploded (sic) by these sci-fi elements. It’s been such a joy to watch it grow.”
When Brooks talks about the play’s growth, she really means it. Siañez-De La O said the script for “Truth or Consequences” has taken on three different endings throughout the course of its development. It is specifically this type of malleability, though, that he believes has contributed so much to the crew’s connection with the story.
“Every single time we approached this with a new cast, with a new workshop, we’ve discovered so much about this world,” he said. “[The play] has become so expansive in what it’s trying to combat.”
The process of writing new pages for the script continued until unexpectedly late points in production; even then, opportunities to enrich the play presented themselves. The result of this relentless effort has definitely turned some heads, attracting nationwide recognition even before the premiere.
“Not to toot my own horn, but I’ve talked to Netflix, I’ve talked to some agents, I’ve talked to some people,” he said. “Nothing super real, but there is such a love of sci-fi and a need for things like this.”
The members of Fresh Ink live for “things like this” — plays that, beyond telling important stories, push the crew into uncomfortable territory. Such a reality particularly shines through in Brooks’ experience with “Truth or Consequences.”
“Louise had sent me the draft, and I read it, and I was like, ‘This is not something I would typically work on,’” Brooks said. “It made me excited but nervous, and I was like, ‘Alright, I gotta do it.’”
Ultimately, regardless of how powerful a given story might be, its true power lies in sharing it with others.
“It’s all because someone down the road read the script and passed it on,” Siañez-De La O said, referring to the conversations he had about possibly bringing the play to other places. “So much of playwriting success is people saying, ‘I read it, I loved it, I shared it.’”
Siañez-De La O and the team at Fresh Ink hope that once “Truth or Consequences” opens, people will indeed read it, love it, and share it. That is, if they aren’t devoured by a sentient motel room in the meantime.

Trigger Warning: Mentions of abuse and violence.
After releasing two chapbooks and collaborating with Beyoncé on two of her biggest multimedia projects, expectations were high for Warsan Shire’s debut full-length poetry collection. In “Bless the Daughter Raised by a Voice in Her Head,” Shire boldly weaves together a narrative of what it means to be displaced, disconnected from home, and incredibly vulnerable. She does so through vignettes of her own family and community members in a way that blurs the boundary between blood relations and a greater cultural history. While Shire’s presentation of powerful narratives can draw a deep reaction from readers, her straightforward structure and often disconnected tone makes the collection feel incomplete.
The work begins with two epigraphs — one by Hiromi Itō and one from a Somali children’s lullaby. Together, they lead readers into a feeling of unworthiness and abandonment. Positioning one above the other, Shire connects the sentiments of “I was an ugly child” to the sorrowful tale of when a mother “left the house and took her shoes.” The ache of these emotions creates the perfect entry into what will become a searing pain as Shire’s writing continues.
The collection itself is split into four parts: “What Doesn’t Kill You,” “This is Not a Love Song,” “Are You There, God?” and “Testament.” While the sectioning of her poems in such a way suggests a clear difference between or progression among them, Shire’s poetic style and the content of her poems are rather static until the book’s end. Only then does Shire provide her readers with several jarring accounts of violence, evoking more visceral reactions. She missed an opportunity to create a diverse and dynamic narrative, her message of resilience within the immigrant experience lost within the monotonous series of poetry.
Regarding the physical structure of the poems themselves, Shire doesn’t use forms that could further the feelings she’s attempting to disseminate through her poems’ content. Shire inverts the poem “Backwards,” forcing the reader to reorient themselves and their understanding of the piece. In doing so, she added another layer to the actual content and experience that was being shared within the poem. Aside from this poem, though, Shire doesn’t lean into such experimentation with shape and form in a way that enriches the poems’ contents.
Throughout the poems, Shire uses Somali words when referencing traditional familial, cultural, and religious subjects. These words bring feelings of spirituality and connectedness into the narrative. While she does provide a glossary for the terms, having to jump back and forth while actively reading can generate a disconnect for certain readers. And yet, this is to be expected for a work that aims to share the experience of a specific community with the world. Shire identifies the different ways in which the book may be read, commenting directly on the predicted experiences of her readers. The book can be read in a continuous manner by someone who already knows the Somali words, in a disjointed one by someone who has to reference the glossary as they read, or in a lacking one by the person who chooses to ignore it entirely.
In the poems “Drowning in Dawson’s Creek” and “Victoria in Illiyin,” Shire utilizes footnotes to tie the content of the poems to specific and devastating events. In “Drowning in Dawson’s Creek,” Shire uses the first-person voice of a murdered Somali woman, referring to “my carcass” and “my corpse.” Conversely, in “Victoria in Illiyin,” she embodies the voice of the community who has lost “our Victoria.” In this second poem, Shire implements spiritual and elegant language which disconnects the poem from the disturbing events actually being described. Perhaps she did so out of respect for Victoria herself, wanting to honor her after her death outside of the lens of her murder, but part of understanding and respecting her story could be found in acknowledging the deep injustice that occurred. This creates an irreconcilable difference between the language implemented and the content being referred to within the poem.
Shortly after Victoria’s poem, the collection comes to a close and does so underwhelmingly. Shire zooms drastically back out from her focus on individual stories with “Bless Grace Jones,” a reference to the cultural icon herself. In the poem, Jones gets blown up with titles such as “patron saint of the unapproachable,” creating a stark step away from the feeling of previous poems — one that creates an underwhelming close to the collection. The collection truly ends with the poem “Nail Technician as a Palm Reader,” closing with the image of a daughter “blossoming / out of a hole in my face.” Perhaps Shire is providing her reader with a visceral image of the continuous nature of intergenerational trauma, but at its culmination, the collection continues to lack a narrative which can carry its reader through these deeply harrowing stories. While it is by no means her job to make a reader comfortable with her work, she misses an opportunity to more fully portray these devastating events to her reader and, therefore, respect the poems’ contents.
While Shire presents stories that are deeply personal and rooted in an extensive family history, she doesn’t provide a structure which accentuates that narrative or an arc within the poems’ order that fully respects their content. This being said, these poems are clearly meaningful, and readers can see the grace with which Shire attempts to navigate an inherently striking narrative.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It started as a low rumble. A few voices, slightly on edge, reverberated against the dark wood of Sanders Theater as interns scattered around the building completing their final tasks. As the clock ticked closer to 6:00 p.m., more and more people began filing into their seats — until the nervous rumble built into a roaring symphony of excited chatter and a carefully curated Lady Gaga playlist.
On March 26, the Cultural Rhythms Show and Artist of the Year Ceremony was held in-person for the first time since 2019. The sold-out event was hosted by The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, as it has been annually for the past 36 years. The extravagant showcase of culturally diverse individual and group student performances has become the largest event that the Foundation plans each year alongside smaller initiatives like dialogues and peer-to-peer workshops promoting equity and inclusion.
But the pandemic caused a serious blow to the Foundation’s name recognition on campus. Before, when people thought about the Harvard Foundation, they immediately thought of Cultural Rhythms. But after a canceled show in the spring of 2020 and a virtual show with very limited performances in 2021, only the Class of 2022 has fully experienced the flagship event.
Leslie Arroyo ’23, one of this year’s co-directors, hopes to change that.
“Because of the pandemic, we unfortunately weren't able to have [Cultural Rhythms]. But now that we're back in person, we're hoping to once again re-establish that and have people be able to connect the Foundation to these big events,” she said.
Her fellow co-director Mariana Haro ’23 agreed with the importance of this year’s show. “We both felt it was something we had to do,” she said. “The Harvard Foundation used to be so established on campus and now people ask me all the time, ‘what is the Harvard Foundation?’”
After this year’s show, many more people will surely have an enthusiastic answer to that question.
Hosted by Juan Guzman ’22 and Tiffany Onyeiwu ’25, this year’s Cultural Rhythms was opened by Harvard College Bhangra, followed by Lylena D. Estabine ’24, Mariachi Veritas de Harvard, Athena Capo-Battaglia ’22, Harvard College Deepam, Omo Naija x The Wahala Boys, and Harvard College Candela Latin Dance Troupe.
Following a brief intermission, Lady Gaga was honored as this year’s Artist of the Year for her commitment to BGLTQ rights and mental health advocacy — but unfortunately couldn’t attend in person due to the 94th Academy Awards occurring the next day. For around 15 minutes, Gaga responded to a variety of questions in a pre-recorded conversation projected onto a large screen.
She discussed the importance for her as a white person to unlearn harmful ideas that hold up a “sick system” and how she uses her unique position as an artist to advocate for others. After growing up and being taught in school that being ‘colorblind’ was the right thing to be, “I have unlearned that sentiment,” she said.
“Seeing color is essential. Because when you see color, you see all the life around you.”
When asked why she does what she does, Gaga paused for a moment then said, “In the simplest way I want to tell you — I don't even know. It's just so important.” But as Gaga goes on to elaborate, she eventually reaches a more concrete understanding for herself. “It's the stories of billions of people. Hearing the stories of billions of people made me want to make the world a better place. And the truth is I didn’t make the world a better place, people make the world a better place,” Gaga said.
After the conclusion of the award ceremony, a few final acts began preparing to close the show: The Kuumba Singers of Harvard College took to the stage, followed by Bryant Valenzuela ’25, and finally the Asian American Dance Troupe.
Co-directors Haro and Arroyo were the last to grace the stage of this year’s Cultural Rhythms Show to deliver closing remarks. In the crowd sat Arroyo’s parents and 12-year-old little sister, flown in all the way from California.
“I think a lot of times I talk to them about the work that I do, or the organizations that I'm a part of, but they never actually have been able to witness something that I have worked on,” Arroyo explained after reflecting on the success of the show. “So it was really nice to actually have them here, witness the show, and have them really enjoy it.”
Haro expressed her deepest gratitude to the student performers involved in the show.
“Cultural Rhythms isn’t anything without them, obviously. And the fact that their members are all new or aren’t familiar with Cultural Rhythms, but they all showed up,” Haro said. “They all really took that stage and it was really amazing seeing how all those groups took ownership of Cultural Rhythms. I’m super excited to see them again next year.”

In the world of Anita Rocha da Silveira’s “Medusa,” everything is heightened. Every room is saturated with color, dripping with neon light; each public moment is calibrated to present a polished image; every prayer is passionately spoken then sung in pop-inflected songs on a church stage; and modern life is a minefield of temptations dangled by the devil. That is, at least, according to the film’s main characters, who belong to a sisterhood of pious young women determined to resist the corruption around them, shunning sex and independence as they strive to achieve Godly perfection. Yet their activities aren’t limited to singing, praying, and making upbeat vlogs about “how to take a selfie for the glory of God.”
As audiences see in the early moments of the film, which screened at the Boston Underground Film Festival last week, their orthodoxy has a darker edge. At night, they become a roving squad of violent vigilantes, donning masks to track down women whose behavior they deem improper, beat them, and film them professing allegiance to God. Audiences first meet them in their masked mob, stalking a young woman down the street like something out of a “Mean Girls”/”The Purge” crossover special. As the film progresses, dedicated vigilante Mari (Mari Oliveira) begins to second-guess the teachings of the church and her sisters, especially the ringleader Michele, after she is injured in a scuffle with a victim and gets fired from her job. Embarking on a career as an intensive care nurse, Mari decides to track down the disgraced celebrity Melissa, who was disfigured years before by the original vigilante girl-squad. As Mari attempts to find and photograph her, she descends into the haunted, hallucinatory world of an end-of-life hospital and faces unexpected temptations that lead her to question her faith.
The central vigilante-squad premise, which could easily come across as gimmicky or heavy-handed in its depiction of petty teenagers lashing out, is emotively executed and unpredictably developed. Rather than satirizing her main characters as ridiculous caricatures, Silveira leans into the insidious sincerity of their mission and the glossy aesthetics they hide behind, introducing the story in a hyper-stylized ‘80s palette that fades into a lush, organic green color scheme in film’s second half, when Mari explores the decaying hospital where she works. In the film’s first half, which focuses mainly on Mari and the girls she patrols the street with, Silveira’s heart-racing chase sequences, Oliviera’s nuanced performance, and João Atala’s mesmerizing cinematography manage to ground the absurd violence of Mari’s girl-gang in a twisted and believable reality, emphasizing the relatable humanity of the film’s characters. In the second half, though, the focus shifts to Mari’s hospital job and the fractured politics of her church, and the film’s editing and score heighten the tension of otherwise everyday moments, finding horror in the mundane. In one standout scene, Mari’s hospital is hit by a rolling blackout, throwing the cavernous rooms into intermittent darkness as the dim generator lights flash. As Mari and her coworkers check the patients’ machines, shadows flooding in around them, their routine activity becomes chilling.
Silveira’s antiheroes are at once repulsive and sympathetic, appearing not as caricatures or fools but as complex young people seduced and ultimately alienated by an ultra-conservative religious movement. Through careful narrative and visual incorporation, Silveira shows how the church’s influence is reinforced and ensured through its male vigilante groups, who show off their strength in pageants of masculinity in an attempt to woo the church’s young women and eventually marry one. Where similar narratives of feminist liberation like “The Handmaid’s Tale” frame violent patriarchy as a dystopian threat rather than a historical reality specifically weaponized against Black and brown women, “Medusa” is firmly contextualized within its present-day setting and historical context, showing how communal ties to the church (such as Mari’s boarding house’s religious foundation) maintain antiquated influences and gender roles.
Silveira’s portrayal of the young church members’ heavily-supervised joint activities — from speed dating events to the men’s physical training sessions, which the girls observe — are fraught with repressive expectations, trapping the young women of Silveira’s story in a politely misogynistic and terrifyingly antiquated system. When they finally rebel — in a striking last act sequence — it is the most exaggerated moment of the film (even prompting laughter from the audience) and a symbolic sigh of relief, allowing both the characters and viewers a cathartic experience that ends not where it begins — with violence — but someplace new, outside the cycle of retaliation and rage that propelled the plot thus far.
Through the interplay of these elements, “Medusa” delivers a nuanced take on religious orthodoxy, patriarchy, and sexual liberation, which is particularly relevant in a moment when women are being pulled into anti-feminist backlash movements like the “tradwife” internet phenomenon under the guise of empowerment and self-respect. Silveira treats the patriarchal underpinnings of her fictional community’s misogynistic traditions with the seriousness they deserve, using the horror format to highlight the link between the oppressive system and the inherent violence of its enforcement (from domestic abuse to vigilante assault). Yet Silveira handles these subjects with deft humanity and understated precision, culminating in a film that is at once a gripping horror thriller, a work of visual art, and a resonant social commentary.

Students gathered in the Barker Center’s Plimpton Room last Thursday, April 7 to hear best-selling author Carmen Maria Machado read from her newest piece of fiction, “A Brief and Fearful Star.” Quiet anticipation cloaked the room before the reading began; Machado broke the silence by asking Abby McElroy ’24 about the pink and white knitting she had brought with her, which McElroy feared looked a bit too much like raw meat. “That’s a selling point,” Machado told her, in a manner characterized by a fascination with the strange and the corporeal that fans of Machado’s work have come to love. The room sparkled with laughter, relaxed, and the reading began.
Machado released her memoir “In the Dream House” in 2019 and a collection of eerie short stories, “Her Body and Other Parties” in 2017. Students were thrilled to be in the presence of the award-winning writer — many had been long-time fans.
“I’ve been reading Carmen Maria Machado’s work forever, and as soon as I saw that she was going to be coming to talk at the Barker Center I was so so so excited,” said Sofia Andrade ’24. “I have been following her writing ever since she published her first short story.”
Machado read from “A Brief and Fearful Star,” a new piece of fiction she’s been working on about a “comet that enters space … I think.” The collection of stories about this sci-fi phenomenon expands upon a short story of the same name released in 2018. After publishing her memoir, Machado decided she wanted to return to fiction — specifically short stories — and challenge herself to weave in historical research using the skills she gleaned while writing “In the Dream House.” She plans to continue working on “A Bright and Fearful Star” in the fall.
For 40 minutes, the room sat in rapture while Machado read a poetic excerpt, saturated with heavy themes and broken by moments of humor throughout the text. In it, a narrator living in a world disrupted by the comet flits in and out of different timelines, different lives and settings, all the while attempting to hold on to an intimate relationship with a woman who doesn’t return her feelings. Though Machado assured students that she conceived of the book's idea prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, she acknowledged how the mass panic afflicting the world of her novel after being struck by a comet seems eerily similar to the present day.
“I thought it was incredible,” Julia Pastreich ’25 said. “It was exciting to hear something new she’s been working on and it was really powerful… In many things she writes, the imagery she uses really makes you feel something.”
Within the dystopian world of “A Bright and Fearful Star” — told in the confines of Barker’s austere Plimpton room — were tales rich with queer intimacy and raw desire. Students found the sci-fi world of Machado’s imagination to be both alien and intimately close, dotted with moments of self-reflection seemingly drawn from Machado’s own experiences after publishing her recent memoir.
“I was really excited that she was reading a new piece — I had expected her to read something from one of her existing books, so it felt really special to be in the room and get a sneak glimpse,” said McElroy. “I was also surprised by how personal and intimate the piece was, and I’m excited to one day see how it fits into the larger picture.”
In addition to the reading, Machado answered the questions of eager students, discussing a wide range of topics such as the relationship between pain and writing, the reception of her memoir, and even her love for Shirley Jackson’s “The Haunting of Hill House” — a novel described by Machado as the “perfect horror story.” When she realized only a few students in attendance had read Jackson’s canonical text, Machado responded in disbelief. “What are you guys doing at this school?” she asked. “What’s going on?”
She also spoke about her writing process and the themes that reappear across her body of work. “I’m a very vibes-y writer,” she said. Some authors may start with the logistics, the characters, or the plot. But Machado? “No no no,” she said. “Vibes. Pure vibes.”
In one hour, Machado left students in awe of her ability to speak in both beautiful abstracts and vivid detail, her capacity to write about intimacy and loss and mass panic with humor, and the inner works of her mind both on and off the page.

“Love is contraband in Hell, cause love is an acid that eats away bars.”
These words — written by civil rights activist and Black Panther Assata Shakur — are manifest in every aspect of “The Just and the Blind.” The evening-length multimedia performance, which premiered on April 1, is composed of a series of vignettes that are linked by themes of mass incarceration, police brutality, and systemic racism.
Shakur’s words remind us that throughout the history of Black subjugation and oppression, the ability of love to persevere within communities was an act of resistance, and the fostering of something beautiful against all odds. “The Just and the Blind,” too, unapologetically showcases love despite its themes of extreme marginalization: the love of the artists for each other and their craft; a love for family, Black sons, and community; and a love for the possibilities of the future. Innovative, artistically brilliant, and powerfully urgent, “The Just and the Blind” is a deeply moving performance that provokes thought and emotion far past its conclusion.
Any discussion of the show would be remiss without discussing the array of media it so thoughtfully employs. Linked by common themes of mass incarceration, police brutality, and systemic racism, “The Just and the Blind” synthesizes four main artistic components: spoken word poetry, dance, singing, and instrumentals. Against a backdrop of visuals from animator Xia Gordon and photography from Oakland-based photographer Brittsense, each live element has something unique and necessary to add.
It is difficult to imagine the performance without spoken word artist and poet Marc Bamuthi Joseph’s lyricism. His poetry drives the show forward, including anecdotes from various stages of the speaker’s life. And while Joseph’s text is stellar on its own, his articulate and deliberate delivery elevates the influence of his words. Speaking with a deep voice that rings through the hall, Joseph is able to channel every one of the speaker’s states of being through to the audience. Through pain, hope, anger, and fear, Joseph’s poetic rhythms carry listeners along the highs and lows of the narrator’s emotions and life experiences.
Joseph’s speech is complemented by the instrumentals of composer and musician Daniel Bernard Roumain, primarily on piano and electric violin. Roumain’s inventive soundtrack of melodies ranges from calmly contemplative to hauntingly shrill. Roumain also displays a flair for the unconventional, occasionally playing his violin like a ukulele (while the bow is held between his teeth) and using a synthesizer to create a reverb effect. Pushing the boundaries of tradition, Roumain’s musical contributions are refreshing, creative, and suited for the evocative themes of the show.
The performance is also interspersed with the captivating dance performances of KingHavoc, a Brooklyn native who for nearly 10 years has been one of the key players in establishing Flexing — a style fusing elements of dancehall, reggae, and hip-hop — as an art form. KingHavoc delivers a showcase of extraordinary physicality and rhythm that pays no heed to the rules of anatomy and physics, maneuvering a complex series of floor moves, hopping on and off the central platform, and effortlessly assuming gravity-defying positions. His rhythmic contortions are at once deliberate and sharp but also fluid and free, and when combined with Roumain’s musical backing and Joseph’s storytelling, they bring a focus to the physical body with them. KingHavoc’s dancing represents the many dimensions of the Black body, expressing stories of strength and vulnerability, innocence and criminalization, and confinement and freedom.
Last but certainly not least in the performance are the two songs performed by Boston-based vocalist and Grammy nominee Débo Ray. The pieces were both letters from prison — one from Assata Shakur, the other from Martin Luther King Jr. — adapted into song through melodies composed by Roumain. Ray delivers both pieces with gripping emotion, showcasing her gorgeous, rich tone and her impressive range; she takes full command of the ringing highs, the resonant lows, and everything in between. In these performances, viewers are reminded once again why music and song have been so key to Black culture and resistance for centuries.
The talent present across the four artists cannot be overstated. “The Just and the Blind” achieves a careful balance between allowing each performer to shine solo and combining two or three forms at a time. Thanks to this, viewers can enjoy each artist’s skills individually, but also appreciate what unfolds when they are so masterfully united.
Most of all, “The Just and the Blind” creates a moving, nuanced portrait of the Black experience in America. From the lighthearted tale of Joseph’s narrator getting caught smoking weed in Senegal to his discussions of Black criminality and cycles of incarceration, the performance is a timely piece perfectly situated within modern contexts of racial reckoning in America.
Furthermore, it reminds us that art is not marginal, but rather central to, resistance against all forms of oppression. It is a way of processing emotions and experiences as much as it is a way of building solidarity and creating beautiful things among pain and fear and marginality. A true labor of love from all those involved, “The Just and the Blind” achieves all of these things and more, leaving a lasting artistic and thematic impression on anyone who had the honor to watch.

Dear Judge Ketanji — pronounced “kuh-tahn-jee” — Brown Jackson ’92, you are my role model. You are the embodiment of a successful Black woman and the blueprint for Black girls everywhere. You are the coalition of the strength of our Black mothers and our ancestors’ greatest pride. You are the inspiration of my Harvard experience and a pioneer for defining what Black excellence is within white America.
Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, as an alum of Harvard, you are one of the greatest to have walked these halls. I write this with intentional and precise wording.
You are not one of the greatest Harvard has produced.
Harvard did not produce you.
Harvard was merely a stepping stone for your illustrious career and achievements. You are among the alumni that make Harvard one of the greatest universities in the world. Your presence is the very reason that so many others flock to this school. All in hopes of becoming like you.
You make this University.
Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, our skin tone is one that incites riots. One that causes us to be murdered freely and unjustifiably. One that subjects us to experiencing three times the amount of police brutality than our white counterparts and subjects us to the constant injustice of legal processes. One that shimmers in the sunlight and protects our cells from UV rays. One that invokes creativity and creates entirely new genres of music. One made up of resilience so strong, that after years of the generational trauma we have experienced, we still hold our heads high and fight for what is ours.
Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, as you looked into the eyes of those who despise you during your confirmation hearing, you smiled a toothy grin that made them seethe on their podiums. Your smile beamed with the aura of unrivaled and unadulterated progress. Your intelligence scared and intimidated those upon the stand who could not believe that a woman of your “background” could ever be so qualified. You proved exactly to this country just how qualified you were, and just how overqualified other Black women have to be in this country.
Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, you are one of the most qualified Supreme Court Justices currently appointed to uplift, serve, and enforce our country’s constitution. You being exceedingly knowledgeable and experienced is of no doubt in my mind not a coincidence. Being a Black woman you know what it is like to fight for a seat at the table. You know you must be the most versed within the room to even have a mere place among the discussion in white America.
Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, your tears shed on the Senate floor have not gone unnoticed. Your prideful posture that commands a room does not go unnoticed. Your intricately woven locs that adorn your crown and arouse feelings of prejudice in others do not go unnoticed.
The eloquent manner in which you speak your words and answer back the racist remarks circling the Senate chamber only speaks to the composition of your being. The happiness upon your face as you were confirmed for the seat as a Supreme Court Justice — which persisted even while others disrespectfully walked out — only adds to your magnificent character.
Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, as you fought for confirmation and the court voted for you, two Republican senators arrived in casual clothing to show rebellion. But that did not deter you. You continued with your head held high, reaffirmed with the vigor of our ancestors cheering you on, and went on to make history. As a Harvard student, this only pushes me to do more. To achieve the dreams I have without hesitation even if I haven’t seen someone who looks like me do it before.
You showed me that a little Black girl from Miami inside you can go on to make history. You showed me that the little Black girl from Kentucky inside me can go on to make history.
Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, I clapped for you and imagined being on the front row as you were being confirmed.
Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, you are the shining fruit of our ancestors’ past suffering and will forever go down in history as a part of the definition of Black Excellence.
Dear Judge Ketanji — pronounced “kuh-tahn-jee” — Brown Jackson, you are my role model.

Did you get a likely letter? Ironically unlikely, at least for Harvard students. But rest assured — if you did, you’re in good company.
In an effort to soften the transition from high school to university, many colleges have taken to sending out “likely letters” to students, offering them a sneak peak into their admission outcomes before their scheduled decision day. While Ivy League schools do not promise admission to students before an agreed date, dubbed “Ivy Day,” Harvard and other schools notify a small group of applicants of their “likely” admission, contingent on maintaining their current level of academic achievement. According to Crimson reporting, Harvard sends out about 300 of these likely letters every year, 200 to recruited athletes and 100 to students from underrepresented backgrounds.
The cutthroat world of elite college admissions — starting with Harvard’s new, declining acceptance rate normal — can make these institutions feel remote and inaccessible to many applicants. For students who come from backgrounds where going to college is uncommon, or who are themselves first-generation applicants, the process can be even more harrowing and intimidating.
To such candidates, likely letters offer a jolt of joy, validation, and affirmation halfway through a taxing and uncertainty-ridden admissions process. This extra support can be particularly invaluable to students from underrepresented backgrounds, securing their sense of belonging at our institution and preemptively dispelling the much-feared impostor syndrome. That alone is undeniably commendable.
To be sure, these letters add a positive varnish to a system that, overall, remains riddled by deep-rooted flaws. Indeed, of the large pool of quality applicants, only a tiny fraction are accepted to institutions like ours — an inequity partially driven by these institutions’ unfortunate propensity to favor those born with a silver spoon and a leg up. Legacy admissions and Harvard’s secretive “Z-list” are only the most egregious examples.
Thus, while likely letters provide deserved joy to many, and even if their targeting of underrepresented applicants is laudable, they remain part of a highly-elitist system that denies that same joy to many on questionable grounds.
Frankly, even a perfectly fair iteration of our current admissions system would suffer from a culture, so pervasive in some American high schools, which links self-worth to admissions success. Admission to a school like Harvard comes with more gravitas than it should, and we wish that prestige were valued less. Until that day comes, though, making an effort to share that prestige with deserving and underprivileged students is an unambiguous plus. Well beyond the momentary joy they provide, likely letters are a key tool for the worthy goal of bringing less privileged students to Harvard. The special attention they provide can give Harvard a better shot at the diversity essential to our school’s mission.
Likely letters do their job well. Getting one provides a much-appreciated nudge and confidence boost to deserving students who might just need them to pick Harvard. Their targeted focus on underrepresented students, definitionally the sort of applicants that we wish we could see more of at Harvard, is admirable.
Harvard should aspire to be a community that uplifts marginalized students. These letters bring us a tiny step closer to that ideal, and for that we are grateful.

“Neurodiversity: (noun) the range of differences in individual brain function and behavioral traits, regarded as part of normal variation in the human population (used especially in the context of autistic spectrum disorders).”
The word “neurodiversity” was first coined by Judy Singer, an autism rights advocate, and Harvey Blume, a New York journalist. Popularized by the autism rights and advocacy movement, “neurodiversity” has grown to encompass a variety of “neurological and developmental conditions” to quote Harvard Health Publishing. Nowadays, it is frequently used as a purposefully inclusive umbrella term to allude to conditions including ADHD and dyslexia.
Recent years have seen a much-needed rise in discussion and awareness about neurodiversity, largely aligning with the rise of the internet. Rosanna K. Kataja ’24, who finds herself to be very similar to her autistic brother but is undiagnosed, believes the movement and its social media use have led to an amplification of neurodivergent experiences: Neurodiverse people “are more heard now. Naturally, through social media, everything gets more traction or easier traction.”
In her own activism, the internet has played a powerful role, from the insightful pieces she has written on disability and neurodiversity to the petition that she and Nina M. S. Jensen ’25, created against Sia’s movie, Music, which has been criticized for being ableist towards autistic people. Currently, the petition has 152,479 supporters.
The neurodiversity movement aims to center, uplift, and embrace diverse neurological and cognitive differences. In many ways, the increased dialogue has lent itself to fostering a community for individuals who identify as neurodivergent or with the neurodiversity movement.
Kataja describes the changes she’s seen surrounding dialogue and community regarding ADHD and autism: “I’ve seen personally, ADHD gets a lot of attention, but it used to be like, ‘I have ADHD. I can’t tell anyone’; ‘I have autism. I can’t tell anyone.’ Now, people are like, ‘oh, guess what? I have this.’” In other words, neurodiversity is beginning to receive the attention it hasn’t historically received.
I’ve found the neurodiversity movement to be one that has empowered me. That’s simply the case for me — finally learning that I had ADHD and anxiety provided me with an explanation I’d been searching for desperately. In the movement’s widespread solidarity and awareness, I felt like I wasn’t alone. Instead, I felt inspired to share my own lessons and experiences as I continued to grow and learn about the ways my brain works.
This is not a take shared by everyone. Alexander J. Chen ’24 offers a different perspective: “Since [neurodiversity’s] rising popularity in conversation, it has always been attached with a bit of a negative salience built-in. In that, when people say, ‘Oh, you know, I'm neurodiverse,’ it always precedes or proceeds a conversation about struggles.”
That much can only be expected — after all, as Chen notes, “People who are outwardly neurodiverse have struggled within our society, whether either structural limitations or personal confrontations and emotional damage.”
Like with any movement, neurodivergent terminology continues to change. Particularly with a cause so deeply personal, how individuals identify and relate to it may vary significantly; like any other group or movement, the neurodiversity movement is not a monolith.
Take the use of “neurodiverse” versus “neurodivergent.” On a grammatical level, individuals may argue that only groups of people can be diverse, which is why they believe that individuals who identify with the movement should be referred to as “neurodivergent.” It’s a take that Chen disagrees with based on the implications of the word “divergent”: “Frankly I prefer neurodiversity — because neurodivergent implies a sort of norm.” He continues, “When people say, ‘Oh, look, so-and-so is neurodivergent,” they're implying that there's a sort of norm that everyone has to adhere to.” Ultimately, it’s up to everyone to use the movement’s language as it suits them best.
It’s also a movement, like any movement, with its own limitations and room for improvement.
Kataja sees many of the problems of the neurodiversity movement as ones that are due to problems with the internet, considering the movement’s significant digital scope and reliance. Anonymous individuals, emboldened by the guise of the internet, may harass and bully neurodiversity advocates, potentially not realizing how harmful their behavior is, she details.
That isn’t to say that the movement’s shortcomings are exclusively internet-based.
Kataja provides several examples of its non-web-based flaws. There are “actual problems, not just ‘we have a movie that doesn't represent us well.’”
Of course, media representation comes with its host of secondary issues.
“Many people think, ‘Well, it's just a movie,’ but that's how people start to view autism and be like, ‘Oh, they're just like this,’” she adds.
That, in turn, can lead to “employment problems or not getting your diagnosis and having problems with the doctor's office because of all these stereotypes.” She hopes “the movement would lead to more than just, funny memes on Tik Tok,” though she acknowledges that it is a start in engendering dialogue.
Kataja recounted a story from her own life, with her brother’s autism diagnosis: “The doctors were like as if somebody had died, ‘I'm so sorry about the news. He's autistic.’” But in reality, her mother was grateful to know what was going on.
It’s a stark reminder of how pervasive the stigma is around neurodiversity. Simply put, as Kataja says, “being neurodiverse is not a death sentence.”
Chen also points to neurodiversity’s philosophical limitations, by delving deeper into the cultural and linguistic nuances of neurodiversity’s implications. He explains the following: “I'm really glad that the word neurodiversity has really gained more and more societal acceptance over the past decade. Frankly, in my personal opinion, I don't think the word should be limited. I think the word still retains a stigma of being a substitute for words that we no longer want to use. I think the word should be here in a variety of different fields, whether academic or in social discourse.”
He believes that neurodiversity “should be used to destigmatize to the point where everyone is neurodiverse,” while acknowledging that there are nuances, especially when one’s “own manifestation of neurodiversity is outwardly apparent,” which may “be the case with people, with ASD, maybe with ADHD at times,” and his own experiences with stuttering.
He concludes: “I do identify as neurodiverse.” But, he adds, “I wish for a day, where saying that ‘I identify as neurodiverse,’ isn't a shocking thing to anyone. ‘Yeah, okay, cool. And the sky is blue.’”
For all our diverse thoughts on neurodiversity, it’s up to all of us to provide space and understanding for the infinities of experiences we hold within ourselves and our worlds, past, present, and future.
Neurodiversity isn’t merely about neurodivergent individuals. It’s about all of us; after all, considering our brains will never be the same, your experiences contribute to neurodiversity, in the most literal sense, as do mine. In Chen’s words, “we should all be able to accept that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout the last weekend of March, students from the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players transported audiences to London in the year 3070 through their musical “The Milk Made.”
The production, performed from March 24 to March 27 at Harvard’s Agassiz Theater, told the story of a boat worker in a futuristic Chinese-dominated London who schemes to achieve her dream of herding goats and to help her sister marry, overcoming the existing class structure. HRG&SP adapted the musical from Arthur Sullivan’s operetta “The Mikado,” keeping the original score but completely rewriting the play to eliminate the use of yellow-face and racism found in the original work.
Keagan Yap ’25, the music director of the production, said the cast and crew members were able to bring their personal experiences into the new play.
“A number of our cast and crew members also have Asian heritage and belong to these cultures and to come onto this project — and imbue their identities and imbue their cultures and experiences into this work that has drawn music from centuries ago — I think was a very enlightening experience,” Yap said.
Katherine “Kate” Vandermel ’25, who played the lead role, said the production’s promotion of inclusivity made the show very meaningful for her.
“New lyrics were used to create this show, a show that gives Asian Americans more representation in the arts, and also has a really unique plot and sort of different twist that reflects more contemporary standards,” Vandermel said.
Vandermel said the production saw a successful turnout and was applauded for its reinvention of Gilbert and Sullivan’s work.
“It was really heartwarming to see a lot of people come to see the show,” Vandermel said. “Especially people that were very surprised by this production and how it was able to really innovate traditional Gilbert and Sullivan music and turn it into something new that would reflect a more diverse and more culturally appropriate context.”
Despite the show’s success, Vandermel said the production faced challenges due to its timing, as the show began the week after spring break.
“It was definitely a big challenge in terms of getting everything together, but we did in the end, and I'm really proud of the efforts of everyone in the productions because we were able to put on a successful show,” Vandemel said.
In rewriting Sullivan’s play, the group aimed to ground it in the culture it originally misrepresented.
“At the very core of all of this is just, there’s this long-standing feeling that we want to just respect what for Gilbert and Sullivan was a foreign culture,” Yap said.
Vandermel praised the creativity of Harvard students involved in theater.
“I think it’s really cool coming into this theater scene at Harvard to see like all sorts of unique takes — whether it’s a rewrite of an old show or a completely new show — that are being created alongside more mainstream shows that we already know of,” Vandermel said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ans Irfan, a public health expert and student at the Harvard Divinity School, discussed his project on religion as a structural determinant of health during a virtual presentation on Monday.
Diane L. Moore, the faculty director of the Religion and Public Life program at HDS, moderated the presentation, which also included remarks from Jason J. Ashe, another expert in religion and health who is affiliated with Duke University and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
Irfan’s presentation is the first talk held by the Master of Religion and Public Life program at HDS, which brings together a small cohort of professionals and academics from around the world to study religion’s connection to society and service.
Irfan began by addressing the popular notion that health is solely influenced by biology. While biology influences public health outcomes, Irfan argued that social and structural determinants play a large role but are often forgotten.
According to Irfan, social determinants include “where you grow, live, learn, work, age, and so on,” while structural determinants are affected by macro-level economic, housing, and trade policies.
“Now we understand that only about 15-20 percent of what determines your health is clinical care, on which we are spending about three and a half trillion dollars each year,” Irfan said. “And the rest of it — 80-85 percent — is determined by all of these upstream policies, which we call social and structural determinants of health.”
Irfan said that while religion has been analyzed as a social determinant of health, little literature exists on the role of religion as a structural determinant of health. Irfan speculated the gap in knowledge may be attributed to the conception of public policy as secular in the United States.
“What I do think is that, in any number of policies, one of the normative assumptions in policymaking, including public health policymaking, is that we operate in a secular society when we don't,” Irfan said.
Ashe built upon Irfan’s comments, citing the varied health outcomes for Black and white Christians in the U.S. to highlight religion’s varied impacts for different groups.
“At a macro level, we also need to be looking at how religion in the U.S. may be helping some people and also may be harming others, particularly those who identify as LGBTQ, particularly those who identify as women, particularly people who are living with disabilities, particularly those who are living at the lower-end socioeconomic status,” Ashe said.
Irfan repeated that he does not have exact answers to these complicated questions surrounding the relationship between religion and health, but raising these questions and concerns is necessary.
“If you're not even acknowledging it, how are you going to go about making any interventions towards it?” Irfan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Kraft family, which owns the New England Patriots, donated $24 million to Harvard Business School earlier this month to establish the Robert K. Kraft Family Fellowship Fund, which will be the largest endowed fellowship fund at the school.
The donation, announced by HBS on April 7, will endow a fellowship aimed at supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds. HBS will also name its financial aid office after the Kraft family in recognition of the gift.
The fellowship was endowed by Robert K. Kraft, the Patriots’ principal owner, and his son, Jonathan A. Kraft, who serves as president of the team. It marks the second major donation the family has given to Harvard in the last seven years.
The fund was announced at an event with Robert and Jonathan Kraft — both HBS alums — and Business School Dean Srikant M. Datar.
The fund aims to support students who would not otherwise be able to attend HBS.
The donation comes seven years after the Robert and Myra Kraft Family Foundation pledged $20 million to support activities that advance precision medicine at HBS.
“Being part of HBS changed my life, and I am deeply grateful for the chance to help others benefit from the transformational power of this experience,” Robert Kraft said in the press release. “Our family is proud of the extraordinary difference that our fellowship recipients make in the world.”
Robert Kraft has owned the Patriots since 1994, leading the franchise to six Super Bowl titles. His net worth is estimated to be $8.3 billion, according to Forbes.
In 2019, Robert Kraft was charged with soliciting a prostitute in Florida, where he was allegedly caught on a hidden police surveillance camera paying for sex acts at a day spa. The charges were later dropped and Kraft has since apologized for the incident.
In a statement, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said Harvard “is grateful” for the Kraft family’s “generosity and for the deep care with which they support the members of our community.”
“Harvard Business School has a long and proud history of educating leaders who make a difference in the world, among them Robert and Jonathan Kraft,” he said. “Through this extraordinary act of philanthropy, father and son ensure that more lives are transformed as theirs have been.”
In a press release, Datar, the HBS dean, thanked the Krafts for their support.
“Having the voices of fellow students from a range of cultures, industries, and socioeconomic backgrounds in the classroom broadens everyone’s perspectives on the real-world challenges they will face as business leaders,” Datar said in the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Harvard College students were awarded the Truman Scholarship — an honor recognizing leadership, commitment to a career in public service, and academic excellence — according to a press release issued last week.
Amisha A. Kambath ’22 and Oksanna A. Samey ’23 were among the 58 aspiring public service leaders from 53 colleges and universities nationwide who received the distinction this year. The Truman scholars will be awarded $30,000 in funding for post-graduate studies, along with leadership training, career counseling, and special employment opportunities within the federal government, per the scholarship’s website.
A Social Studies concentrator in Dunster House, Kambath said she knew since arriving at the College that she wanted to enter the legal profession. She tailored her extracurriculars around this interest, getting involved with the Harvard College Project for Justice and the Institute of Politics. Kambath has also conducted research with Harvard Kennedy School professor Sandra Susan Smith.
Kambath credited her exposure to the criminal justice system, including a summer internships at the public defender’s office in Washington D.C. and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, for helping her more clearly envision how she wants to move forward in her career.
“[These intern experiences] helped me have a much clearer conception of where I wanted to position myself and how I want to position myself in terms of working to change the criminal legal system and kind of the landscape economic opportunity around it,” she said. “So I think that — if I had to guess — paid off pretty well in the application.”
Kambath added that the process of putting together the Truman application was “really wonderful” because it allowed her to reflect on her various roles and research experiences at Harvard.
“I just think the mode of engaging with the application and the Truman process — like what it kind of pulled out of me — is something that I’m really, really appreciative of,” she said.
Kambath said she plans to use the funding for law school and is “strongly considering” pursuing a Ph.D.
Samey — an Integrative Biology concentrator in Mather House — said the scholarship validated her “more unconventional route” to public service.
Samey, who hails from Minneapolis, worked with grassroots activists during the pandemic to deliver wellness supplies to residents in her hometown who could not access grocery stores due to health concerns and the murder of George Floyd. She said the experience contributed to her understanding that public service is “fluid.”
“All that you really need to impact the community around you is a desire to do so,” Samey said. “You don’t need permission from academic credentials or from the place that you’re employed to determine whether or not you can actually impact your community.”
Samey also cited her research in Covid-19 vaccine credential hesitancy, in which she investigated how different identities correlated with distrust in healthcare infrastructure. She said the experience highlighted why public service initiatives should include the perspectives of the people they aim to help.
“Looking at that information really showed how people are informed by their circumstances,” she said.
Samey added that she was able to apply the lessons from her research to her work as the inaugural diversity and inclusion officer and second-ever Black chief of CrimsonEMS, Harvard’s student-run emergency medical service. Within the group, she has focused on initiatives to increase patient agency and decrease bias.
“That made up a lot of who I am and how I view medicine, how I view public health and public service,” she said.
Samey said she plans to use the scholarship to pursue an MD/MPH and hopes to work on bridging access gaps and mitigate racialized disparities in healthcare through a career in preventative care.
“For me, it was really influential to win the Truman Scholarship, because it shows that there’s more than one route towards public service in a way that I wasn’t able to conceptualize before,” she said.

When Hakim J. Walker began serving as a proctor in Harvard’s freshman dormitories in 2018, he was assigned eight to ten freshmen to advise.
Proctoring, Walker said, was the “perfect role” to learn more about Harvard. Like many proctors, Walker said he loves working with students and is passionate about the advising aspect of his job.
But when he arrived on campus this fall, Walker was assigned 16 freshmen to advise. The transition to taking on more advisees, Walker said, was “definitely taxing.”
Proctors help freshmen transition into college life, overseeing an entryway of 20 to 40 students by planning study breaks and enforcing residential rules. In addition, proctors are required to advise a smaller cohort of students academically, providing course recommendations and educational support.
Proctors — who must be enrolled in a Harvard graduate program or employed by the University — report to Harvard’s First-Year Experience office, which oversees advising and residential life for freshmen. In exchange for their work, they receive free housing in their freshman entryway and a meal plan in the freshman dining hall.
This year, the College’s 78 freshman proctors are responsible for the largest class in the school’s history — likely a consequence of Covid-19. Almost 350 members of the Class of 2024 deferred their enrollment while instruction was virtual, joining the oversized Class of 2025.
The large class size has augmented many proctors’ workloads, which some say has created burnout and worsened the quality of freshman advising. In interviews with nine current and former proctors over the last month, many said Harvard’s First-Year Experience Office has not provided enough support as advising responsibilities have increased. Some proctors spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation from the FYE.
Though some proctors believe a smaller freshman class next year will alleviate some of their concerns, others worry that the proctor program and its compensation structure are breeding burnout and tension between proctors and the FYE Office.
According to archives of the Harvard College Dean of Students Office’s website, no proctors left mid-year during the 2020-2021 school year. But this year, five have departed mid-year, forcing Harvard to scramble to fill spots.
Nekesa C. Straker, a senior assistant dean who oversees the FYE, wrote in a statement that many residential staff — not just proctors — have left mid-year.
“There are a number of reasons, some of which are personal and some of which result from changes in Harvard affiliation,” Straker wrote.
Ben D. Grimm ’18, who left the proctor role mid-year due to dissatisfaction with his graduate program, said he believes there was a “miscommunication” between proctors and the FYE before the fall about the number of students each proctor would advise. In his first year in the role this fall, Grimm was assigned 15 advisees.
In past years, proctors have typically been responsible for six to 12 advisees, according to Aliya S. Bhimani, who directs the Advising Programs Office. But this year, most have 12 to 18, Bhimani wrote. The DSO’s website says proctors should expect to advise eight to 10 students.
A first-time proctor who was assigned 15 advisees said the workload was “extremely rough.”
At least three proctors said the larger cohort of advisees created significant stress at the start of the fall semester, when students meet with advisers for help with selecting courses and transitioning into college life.
One proctor said they stayed up until 3 or 4 a.m. preparing for meetings with their 15 advisees at the beginning of the semester.
“It was really hell,” they said.
That proctor took a week off from their full-time job to focus on proctoring early in the semester, when they said they worked 70-80 hours per week.
Proctors attributed their high advising loads to the increase in freshman class size. The Class of 2025, at 1,965 students, is the largest in Harvard’s history, largely due to Covid-19 deferrals and a high yield rate. Just 1,415 members of the Class of 2024 enrolled last fall, compared to 1,666 in the Class of 2023 the year prior.
Straker wrote that her office was “realistic” about expectations for the year, making adjustments to support proctors. She acknowledged the unique challenges proctors may face.
“Working with students to enforce ever-evolving on-campus protocols while also balancing your own personal and family life can certainly take a toll,” Straker wrote.
Not all proctors have felt burnout. Grimm, who previously worked at a boarding school, said the transition into proctoring was smooth and that he loved his job.
But five proctors said they worried that having more advisees lowered the quality of their advising. When some raised concerns about this last fall, the FYE allowed proctors to hold group advising sessions instead of the standard one-on-one meeting — a change three proctors decried as an ineffective substitute.
All proctors receive a limited number of meal swipes per day and housing in a freshman dorm as their only payment, which makes it difficult to raise compensation if workload increases.
“You’re increasing the workload without any increase in benefits, because it’s not possible to increase the benefits,” Grimm said. “What are you going to do, give us more food at Annenberg?”
When two proctors raised concerns to the FYE that dining halls were closed before students returned to campus and their rooms lacked kitchens, they said they were told to purchase takeout.
“Proctors have been encouraged to utilize common kitchens throughout the Yard, as well as grab-and-go meals from the dining halls,” Dean of Students Office spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote in an emailed statement.
The accommodations in freshman dorms vary widely, which at least four proctors said creates an unequal compensation structure.
“There’s a lot of compensation inequality,” one proctor said. “Housing is so dependent on your yard, your family situation, how long you’ve been here, and whatever the FYE decides.”
Despite taking on the proctor role for free housing, Grimm said he found himself in a freshman dorm without basic amenities.
“I lived in one of the worst proctor apartments — it’s no bathroom, no kitchen, no closet, on the fifth floor of Weld,” Grimm said. “It, at the beginning, was really odd for me to run into people that I was technically in charge of while I was brushing my teeth.”
Proctors aren’t the only ones who advise Harvard freshmen: Some students are instead assigned non-resident advisers, who do not live in freshman dorms and work on a voluntary basis. Bhimani wrote that more than 310 faculty and staff serve as non-resident advisers.
According to the APO’s website, non-resident advisers receive two to eight students to advise, a lighter advising load than proctors.
“That’s a frustration for proctors as well: you have way more advisees than the non-residents, and you have advisees that require a lot more time and energy,” Grimm said.
Three proctors said they believe advising has suffered as a result of poor organization in the administration.
Straker wrote that the College and Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences expanded housing and proctor hiring to support the larger freshman class.
Five proctors who have brought negative feedback to the FYE office said they feel their concerns have fallen on deaf ears. Others — including proctors on one-year contracts who are hoping to extend their tenure — said they were afraid to speak out.
“If you don’t know exactly what is going to be stepping out of line and you don’t feel trust that if you make a mistake that it will be held with care, that creates a real environment of anxiety,” one proctor said.
When The Crimson contacted nearly every freshman proctor in March, Straker messaged proctors via Slack saying they could “feel free to ignore” the newspaper’s inquiries — a statement some viewed as intimidation and an attempt at censorship.
“It sounds like a number of you have received emails from the Crimson regarding your experiences as a proctor. Feel free to ignore the message,” Straker wrote in a March 29 message to proctors that was obtained by The Crimson. “Not trying to censor your thoughts but just trying to learn more about the intent of the article. If for some reason you have talked with them, please let me know so I can work with communications appropriately.”
Later that day, she sent a second message saying she was not seeking to censor proctors, but to “figure out what was going on.”
“If you feel you would like to share your experiences in the proctor role with the Crimson, you should feel free to,” Straker wrote in the follow-up message. “However, from my nearly 20 years working with student newspapers, it does not go the way one hopes it will.”
Five proctors said they took issue with the Slack messages from Straker. One proctor said the messages made it feel “intimidating” to talk to The Crimson.
“I shouldn’t have to loop in the person overseeing these working conditions when I’m trying to talk freely about those working conditions,” another proctor said.
In a statement to The Crimson, Straker wrote that she works to create a “supportive and positive environment” for proctors and FYE staff.
“It is always disappointing when we hear about staff members having had a bad experience, but we use these opportunities to continuously grow and make improvements,” Straker wrote.
Five proctors interviewed by The Crimson said last fall, many proctors discussed unionizing. Those interviewed said it appears unlikely the plans will move forward, in part because proctors do not receive financial compensation and because there is a lack of complete buy-in.
Five proctors who raised concerns about the FYE acknowledged that not all of their colleagues share their frustrations, saying that there is a wide range of feelings among proctors writ large about the office.
Going forward, some proctors are hopeful that a smaller freshman class will ease some of this year’s stressors, while others expressed reservations.
“This is not sustainable in the long run, having this many advisees,” one proctor said.
Another proctor said if a strong support system were in place, proctor burnout would be less prevalent, even with a higher number of advisees.
Straker wrote that the FYE incorporates feedback from proctors each year in planning.
“Moving forward, we will continue to work with the Proctors, and other partners like the Advising Programs Office, Yard Operations, and those who plan programs for first-year students to support them in their time at Harvard,” she wrote.
One proctor said they feel the role has become more bureaucratic than expected, with study breaks being used to share information around evolving Covid-19 policies rather than promote bonding within the entryway.
Still, some proctors are hopeful that conditions will return to normal in the coming years due to a decrease in the number of advisees or reforms to the proctoring system.
“I really love first-year students,” one proctor said. “I just hope that there are institutional changes that make it easier to be a proctor — make it easier for us to take care of our students and more enjoyable to be part of the community.”

One of the best things about Harvard (and college, generally) is that you can finally escape the rigidness of only being able to take certain classes in high school, whether they are APs, IBs or A-Levels. As prospective Harvard students, you may have heard of some of the classic introductory classes offered here — Economics 10a: “Introduction to Microeconomics,” Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science,” Psychology 1: “Introduction to Psychological Science,” or Life Sciences 1a: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences.” Yes, these classes are fundamental and you will probably have to take some of them depending on your concentration, but, a) all colleges have an equivalent of these intro classes and b) I think it’s safe to say that these classes are not what make Harvard fun.
Harvard has so many cool departments and funky classes that you can take during your time here. As you are making your college decision, scroll through the course catalog and check out departments that may seem random relative to your interests at first (I’m looking at you, Folklore and Mythology). You never know what you’ll find or what new interests will be sparked. I’ll get you started: here are some fun classes to consider looking into!
ANTHRO 1201: “Human Osteology & Bioarchaeology”
What’s cooler than pretending to be Indiana Jones for an entire semester? Over the course of the semester, you put together a “bone notebook”–which is basically a collection of sketches of bones. Plus, if you’re looking to live out your crime drama fantasies, you get to handle actual human and animal remains.
AFVS 53AR: “Fundamentals of Animation”
Moana. Encanto. Coco. Inside Out. Soul. Need I say more? Imagine being able to create something that falls in the same category as these movies! No, you don’t need any prior experience to take this engaging and hands-on Arts, Film and Visual Studies course.
PSY 980AH: “Psychology of Cults”
While you may not be able to take this as a first-year, this class will be waiting for you as an upperclassman. It will equip you with everything you need to know about -how to start your own cult , how cults work, why people decide to join them and how cult leaders come to be.
MUSIC 1: “Introduction to Western Music, from Bach to Beyonce”
This class is easily the best class I’ve taken at Harvard and made me consider concentrating in Music. Not only is the teaching staff phenomenal, but the assignments are genuinely a great time — you get to listen to beautiful pieces of music, research interesting and often overlooked musical figures and patrons, and look at really cool, old pieces of music. Take this class, take this class, take this class!
FOLKMYTH 150: “Internet Folklore, Online Communities, and Digital Storytelling”
What do Twitter, TikTok or Facebook have to do with ancient storytelling? What sort of relationships are people hoping to find through exchanges of memes, DMs and snapchats? What stories get told in a world of fake news and internet trolls? Not convinced by how cool this class is yet? The readings for this class range from Tweets to ancient Greek myths!
Exploring your interests is part of what makes college so exciting! Harvard is a melting pot for renowned professors and faculty in almost every academic corner–so why not try a little bit of everything and see what you find?

One of the best parts about Harvard (in addition to the world-class liberal arts education that it very much offers) is the opportunity to meet really amazing people (some people more amazing than others). Even over the couple days of Visitas, you’ll have the chance to experience a little bit of what makes Harvard so special. Here’s a list of our favorite people, places, and things around campus that you should keep an eye out for during Visitas!
Remy
He’s handsome, he’s a little mysterious, and he catches everyone’s attention when he struts into a room. His name is Remy, and he’s sure to be the main star of your Visitas visit, if you’re lucky enough to spot him. Have I mentioned he’s a cat? Known for frequenting the Barker Center for the Humanities, Remy is Harvard’s unofficial mascot (since our real mascot is literally a color). He’s even been known to even enter students’ dorms (he once entered both our respective dorms, but neither of us were in our rooms at the time and we live with eternal regret). You can check out Remy’s instagram (@remy.the.harvard.cat) before Visitas so you know who to look out for.
John from Annenberg
We stan all the Harvard University Dining Services workers for feeding us, but a special shoutout to John from Annenberg for being there for us first-years when we need it most. And since every student at Harvard has eaten at Annenberg at some point in their Harvard life, John literally knows every single one of us. There is no better feeling than walking into Berg after a really hard test or an especially boring section and getting greeted by John. He once complimented my hair and I still smile from his kind words. Unfortunately, John now works in the Dunster Dining Hall, incoming first-years may have to look a little harder to find him. Regardless of where you are, John, we appreciate you!
Rakesh
How does one describe Dean Khurana — Rakesh, if you will? He is, simply, The Moment. Officially the Danoff Dean of Harvard College, most students recognize him more as an influencer. His famous Instagram page (@deankhurana) features photographs of students he meets across campus, and if you’re lucky, you might even be featured during your Visitas visit.
Red (and his best catches)
Who is this man, and what does he look like? We may never know. Whoever he is, Red is always offering his best to the dining hall menu. Every time I see that the dhalls are serving Red’s Best Catch, those fluffy mounds of fish flesh covered in breadcrumbs, I’m just thrilled. Just wait, you will be too!
Turkeys
Who knew turkeys weren’t just for Thanksgiving dinner? I didn’t! Until I came to Harvard, that is. The campus turkeys are everything I want to be: confident, fearless, and constantly defying people’s expectations. Not only are they capable of holding up traffic and intimidating students and tourists alike, these lovely turkeys are also capable of soaring high and far. If you can’t see any turkeys at ground level, look up and you’re sure to see these majestic creatures perching on the many trees on campus.
Yard Chairs
Thanks to a groundbreaking Flyby article investigating everyone’s favorite useful Yard decoration, the Yard chairs have become a sensation. Feeling overwhelmed by how beautiful the Harvard buildings are and need a place to rest? Have no fear, these exquisite chairs will always be there for you (unless, of course, it’s winter, then the chairs won’t be there or else they’ll get cold)! Aside from their seasonal presence, look forward to these incredibly colorful and comfortable chairs.
As you can see, there are so many things to look forward to at Harvard, so get hyped and make sure to take tons of pictures with our favorite campus celebrities!

We know you’re all asking yourselves the same questions: where exactly do freshmen live? How do they get assigned dorms? Which dorms are the best? And, what is ~The Yard~? Prefrosh, we’ve got you covered. Welcome to Flyby’s first-year housing guide, where we’ll spill the deets about the housing process and dorm life during your freshman year!
Early in the Summer, you will fill out a housing application, indicating your lifestyle choices (how clean you are — don’t lie, how noisy you are, your sleep schedule, the essentials). You can also write a page elaborating on your preferences. Around mid-August, Harvard will send an email announcing your Yard (a group of dorms), dorm, entryway (20-40 students you live close to), and suitemates! Be prepared to see many (many) Instagram stories of people announcing their dorms. But before that, check out our rundown of the perks of living in each of the first-year dorms.
Ivy Yard consists of eight small but mighty dorms, most of which are located in the heart of the “Old Yard.” If you’re in Ivy Yard, you’ll never have to wake up before 8:50 a.m. for your 9 a.m. class. Although, you may occasionally get tourists peering through your windows.
Holworthy 
Typical housing style: Holworthy suites consist of two doubles and one (very large!) common room. Residents share a bathroom with the other suite on the floor.
Nearby: The Science Center, Annenberg (food!), Hemenway (the Law School gym)
Amenities: Arts and crafts room, party space basement, music practice rooms, kitchen
Missing: Laundry room (many Holworthy residents have been seen lugging their clothes to Stoughton or Thayer), trash room
Fun facts: Holworthy has vertical entryways (a.k.a. no typically long college hallways), so you have to make an effort to get to know students in other entryways.
Stoughton 
Typical housing style: Two roommates to a very, very large room. Doubles for days!
Nearby: The Science Center, Annenberg, Hemenway, Johnston Gate
Amenities: Laundry room, kitchen
Missing: Singles (a.k.a. bring your roommate a gift on the first day)
Fun facts: The Hasty Pudding Club held its first performance on the top floor!
Hollis 
Typical housing style: Like Stoughton, doubles so large you won’t know what to do with yourself!
Nearby: Johnston Gate, The T stop
Missing: Laundry (sorry friends, it’s a short walk next door to Stoughton)
Fun Facts: Hollis was built in 1763 and is super historic. Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau both lived in Hollis, but we promise them fleeing to the woods had nothing to do with the dorm.
Apley Court 
Typical housing style: Apley has singles, doubles, and triples (the works)
Nearby: Smith Campus Center, Farkas Hall, Clover Restaurant, JP Licks, the MAC (gym)
Amenities: Laundry, bathtubs!!
Missing: Relevance
Fun facts: Marble… marble staircases! marble floors! And, most importantly, marble bathtubs!
Lionel
Typical housing style: Triplets and quads, all with their own in-suite bathrooms
Nearby: PBHA, the Science Center, Annenberg, Pokeworks, Felipe’s
Amenities: Lionel shares its own courtyard with Mower
Fun facts: We’re not really sure if anyone actually lives here.
Mower 
Typical housing style: Triplets and quads, all with their own in-suite bathrooms
Nearby: PBHA, the Science Center, Annenberg, Pokeworks, Felipe’s
Extra perks: Mower shares its own courtyard with Lionel
Fun facts: Like Lionel, we’ve genuinely never met someone who lives here. But Al Gore did at one point.
Massachusetts Hall 
Typical housing style: Doubles and singles
Nearby: Johnston Gate, The T
Amenities: President Bacow’s office ???
Missing: Windows
Fun facts: If you’re placed in Mass Hall, Harvard thinks you’re a goody-two-shoes who won’t throw parties in your room (and you probably shouldn’t). Mass Hall is the oldest building on campus and the only dorm that housed soldiers during the American Revolution!
Straus 
Typical housing style: Suites of quads, with some doubles and triples. All rooms have in-suite bathrooms
Nearby: Widener, Boylston, Felipe’s, Source Restaurant
Amenities: Common room, kitchen, tiny courtyard shared with Matthews!
Missing: Laundry!
Fun facts: Straus is known for its old-academia style common room - perfect for discussions of Bridgerton season two.
Elm Yard is also in the heart of the Yard. If you live in this yard, you’ll undoubtedly be in the middle of students running to class, tourists, and many friendly squirrels and dogs.
Grays 
Typical housing style: Suites of four with en-suite bathrooms and huge common rooms!
Nearby: Smith Campus Center, Boylston Hall, Widener Library, Harvard Square
Amenities: Serenity space in the basement.
Missing: Laundry!
Fun facts: Grays has an unofficial reputation as the “Hilton of Harvard” but we’re not really sure why. It’s not even that much nicer than Matthews or Weld, though it does have in-suite bathrooms. The suites on the fifth floor are great for hosting parties. Notable alumni include Malia Obama and Natalie Portman!
Matthews
Typical housing style: Suites of three students with hallway bathrooms.
Nearby: Smith, Harvard Square, CVS, and the T!
Amenities: Multiple study spaces in the basement, cute library nook, two music practice rooms and a kitchen!
Missing: Matthews has literally everything — except an elevator.
Fun facts: Many Matthews do and have in fact lived in this dorm, including Matt Damon. Matthews also stands in the location of Harvard’s Native American College.
Weld 
Typical housing style: A suite with doubles and singles! You may have an in-suite bathroom or use the communal bathroom.
Nearby: Widener Library, Lamont Library
Amenities: Weld Solarium, Yard Ops and Dorm Crew, laundry, an elevator!
Missing: Large common rooms.
Fun facts: Weld has it all, with extra Covid-19 tests and cleaning supplies in the basement. And, although we’ve been told you can’t really see stars from the Weld solarium, it’s the perfect study nook or late night date spot.
Oak Yard is the part of Harvard Yard that is furthest from the Square, but closest to the Science Center, Annenberg, and basically all of your classes (unless you’re an engineering student). If you live in this Yard, you will endlessly appreciate the ability to wake up three minutes before class and still be on time.
Canaday 
Typical housing style: Some hallway singles and a lot suites with a common room and four bedrooms that are mostly singles!
Nearby: The Science Center, Annenberg, Memorial Church
Amenities: Harvard College Women’s Center, vending machines, air hockey table, laundry room, kitchen
Missing: Elevators.
Fun facts: The top floor has skylights and really tall ceilings! Canaday is riot-proof which is why the entryways don’t connect and there are locks to both the hallway and rooms inside it — so rest assured, no one will break into your room. Living in Canaday can feel like being in a fortress, but the good news is it makes living in an upperclassman House feel like the Ritz.
Thayer 
Typical housing style: Doubles! Singles! Small suites that hold 2-3 people.
Nearby: Memorial Church, The Science Center, Annenberg
Amenities: Kitchen and common room space decked with a pool table, T, and laundry. Also, a functional elevator.
Missing: In-suite bathrooms — everyone uses hallway bathrooms (but they get cleaned for you!).
Crimson Yard isn’t in the traditional Harvard Yard, but if anything, that makes the community stronger. Crimson Yard is located a few minutes away from the Yard across Quincy street and has more of a neighborhood feel compared to the other freshman dorms. A plus is that you won’t have any tourists sticking their phones up to your window, trying to snap a pic of your dorm room.
Pennypacker
Typical housing style: Suites of four arranged in two doubles around a common room with in-suite bathroom.
Nearby: Food!! (Zinneken's, Berryline, Kung Fu Tea), The Barker Center, Lamont Library
Amenities: Home to WHRB, Harvard’s student-run radio station.
Fun facts: Pennypacker only has one central staircase, so you will be running into everyone. At all times.
Hurlbut 
Typical housing style: Suites of typically six people with an in-suite bathroom.
Nearby: Food!! (Hong Kong, Santouka), Lamont Library, Barker Center
Amenities: Laundry room, it’s very own ~lawn~
Fun facts: Everyone in Hurlbut is really close since there’s a backstair case that connects the suites together. We’ve also heard it has a particularly noteworthy vending machine.
Greenough 
Typical housing style: Big suites, typically of six, with in-suite bathrooms. Also has singles, doubles, and triples that share a hallway bathroom.
Nearby: Barker Center, Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, Harvard Art Museum, Lamont
Amenities: Laundry room
Fun facts: Greenough has giant windows in common rooms with lots of natural light. You might have a beautiful view of Harvard Art Museums!
Wigglesworth 
Typical housing style: Suite style, typically of 4-5 people, with an in-suite bathroom.
Nearby: Basically every interesting store and restaurant on Mass. Ave, since Wigg takes up a large portion of the street. Particularly noteworthy is the proximity to J.P Licks (ice cream!!), the Smith Center, and a Harvard Shuttle stop at Widener Gate.
Amenities: Music practice rooms, printer in the basement of Wigg-let, laundry room in Big Wigg, air hockey & ping pong!!
Missing: Quiet — the T runs under Wigg so sometimes students can hear/feel the train.
Fun facts: Wigg is the second biggest of the first-year dorms, composed of three buildings: Wigglet, Mid Wigg, and Big Wigg. It is also the former home of Bill Gates.
Maple Yard 
Maple Yard is the newest and coolest (literally true given that it has air-conditioning) Yard. It was created to house first-year student overflow, and contains some of the most coveted dorms. Unfortunately, all of Maple is away from the Yard like Crimson Yard, but the large rooms and numerous amenities make up for it.
The Inn
Typical housing style: Doubles with in-suite bathrooms
Nearby: Food!! (Tatte, J.P. Licks), Lamont Library
Amenities: Several large study and social spaces, laundry, and practice rooms
Missing: The coveted ~old and traditional~ Harvard vibes, since it looks like (and used to be) a modern hotel
Fun facts: Everyone will make fun of you when you tell them you’re from the Inn. But don’t worry, they’re really just jealous of your air-conditioning.
Prescotts
Typical housing style: Apartment style rooms with bathrooms, kitchens and many singles along with large open common rooms.
Nearby: Next door to Starbucks, Broadway Marketplace (a small grocery store), and Harvard Art Museums.
Amenities: Your own bathroom AND kitchen, printers, and singles.
Missing: Proximity to the Yard. Once you leave your dorm for the day, you are probably not coming back for a while. Even Prescott NARPS have an excuse to get a scooter, but this is just good preparation for upperclassmen House Life.
Fun facts: A full sized fridge?? A bathtub?? A literal monster sized room?? This is peak housing.
While there are pros and cons to each first-year dorm, we promise that each offers a unique experience and will serve as a warm welcome to your new Harvard home. Here are some Youtube videos (Straus, The Inn, Wigg) that we found helpful when scavenging the depths of the internet for dorm information the summer before moving onto campus — you might too!
