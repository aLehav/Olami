After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s rare that an artist radically departs from their former musical project, and it’s once in a blue moon that they depart from the musical project, from all the sounds that came before, making something that sounds like nothing you've heard. The Weather Station, however, the musical project of Toronto-based folk artist Tamara Lindeman, has done just that. Her new single “Robber,” released last month, turns away from the sweet, understated tenor of her last three folk albums and veers — with headlights beaming — into something that sounds like a jazz bar and a disco club had a child and that child walked into the woods and stumbled upon the occult. Which is, presumably, unlike anything listeners have heard before.
The song is a slow build. It’s all tension and anticipation, which is perhaps why it’s so enrapturing: Nothing is better than the feeling of walking toward a mirage. On Spotify, Lindeman created a playlist for the single entitled “Robber Inspo.” It’s mostly jazz and disco — two genres which often produce songs that are quite long (Think “Watermelon Man” by Herbie Hancock or “I Feel Love” by Donna Summer) — but it seems to collapse time onto itself. “Robber” begins with drum taps on a cymbal which, at first, are few and far between, but become more and more frequent as they are joined by other notes of percussion, piano rings, a saxophone, and a trumpet — truly, the whole shebang. Lindeman’s crisp vocals make sure each word pulls its weight, a genuine feat given how intimidating and full the instrumentals are. You might be so fascinated by those instrumentals that it takes you a long time before you stop and listen to what exactly it is that she’s singing about.
And what she’s singing about is late capitalism. Admittedly, critiquing late capitalism and neoliberalism is hardly new; suburban TikTok kids are going on and on about it, and even Netflix seems to have joined in with its new release on big tech, “The Social Dilemma.” (As Pierre Cadault from the infamous “Emily in Paris” would say: “Ringarde!”) But just because something is common knowledge or “basic,” doesn’t make it any less worthwhile. There is, after all, a reason it’s catching fire. Lindeman at first sings about not believing in the folklore of who a robber is: a man with a big black bag, gloved hands and a beanie who jumps over your fence and takes your “stuff” in the middle of the night. "A robber must hate you to wanna take from you,” she sings, which is perhaps the biggest farce of this piece of folklore: that the robber is some nefarious, sinister being who exists outside the dictums of basic human morality. But throughout the song, the real robber comes into focus: “No, the robber don't hate you, he had permission / Permission by words, permission of thanks/ Permission by laws, permission of banks / White table cloth dinners, convention centers / It was all done real carefully.”
In a statement accompanying the single, Lindeman writes: “To put it straight: there are real human people who are literally robbing us and all future generations of all of everything that matters, right now. But we literally can’t see that as a society, because for one thing we’ve been taught not to value what is taken… [and] we don’t know how to see the victim of the taking.” Lindeman’s use of robber is no metaphor — it’s an attempt to call a spade a spade. ​In this way, the song’s full and blistering instrumentals could be understood as the cacophony that drowns out any sense, that makes invisible that which is right in front us. And the robber is right in front of us. He’s not jumping over anyone’s fence so much as we’re inviting him through the gate with our every engagement in consumer culture. In Lindeman’s words, he has been given permission. “Robber” is still part of Lindeman’s folk project insofar as it is about the systems that rob us, even as so many of us are contently complicit in the heist. “Robber” is like the journey of a single thought: reality is so much stranger and so much worse than fiction; the robber, it turns out, is no myth, but is all too real. And this thought ends with another: What to do about the robber?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow called on President-elect Joe Biden to “prioritize the consideration of international students and scholars” in a Monday letter that proposed a slew of immigration policy changes to the incoming administration.
Bacow asked Biden to “act without delay” to issue guidance allowing international students who are enrolled full-time to maintain or receive student visa status — even if classes are online — for the rest of the pandemic, and to reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
“To remain a world leader, the US and its colleges and universities must be open to ensure that we do not become isolated from the discourse that occurs outside of our borders,” Bacow wrote. “Our present immigration system does not do nearly enough to encourage the legitimate flow of people and ideas or recognize the contributions that immigrants make to the US.”
Currently, under guidance from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, only previously-enrolled international students can stay in the country while taking online courses. Bacow has lobbied at least four members of Congress in recent months to ask for more leniency for international students who are forced to take online classes due to the pandemic.
“Such a policy will allow schools to assign top priority to the safety of their communities while at the same time minimizing disruptions to the academic progress of students, especially those outside of the United States who have persevered through the fall term with unreliable or restricted internet and dramatically different time zones,” Bacow wrote.
The letter — which marks the first official communication between Harvard and the incoming administration — comes on the heels of years of public conflict between the University and the Trump administration over immigration policy. Harvard and MIT sued federal immigration authorities in July to reverse a policy that barred international students taking online-only courses from staying in the country. Days later, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement rescinded the policy.
Bacow called on Biden to “ensure that visa processing is streamlined and predictable, with a reasonable timeframe for adjudication.”
“Over the past four years, executive orders and presidential proclamations have barred entry to many, with others beset by processing delays, backlogs, and administrative hurdles designed to frustrate access to opportunities in this country,” Bacow wrote. “As a result, a shadow of uncertainty has been cast over immigrants and nonimmigrants alike—and it has taken a toll.”
Biden has pledged to restore DACA, an Obama-era program that protects individuals who were brought into the U.S. as children without citizenship or legal residency from deportation. Bacow told The Crimson on Dec. 3 he would “welcome” the expansion of DACA, which Trump has worked to terminate throughout his presidency.
In Monday’s letter, Bacow also requested that the incoming administration reissue Temporary Protected Status to individuals from countries in conflict or crisis. Trump phased out the protections — which allow people from countries in crisis to live and work in the U.S. — for hundreds of thousands of immigrants.
“Until we are able to achieve a more permanent solution, protections will be necessary to ensure that these individuals do not lose the right to live and work in the United States, including many at Harvard,” he wrote.
Bacow also wrote he is “pleased” with Biden’s plan to end the Trump administration’s travel ban, which restricts travel to the U.S. from a number of countries with predominantly Muslim populations.
“I encourage you to carefully review and reconsider these other entry bans, ensuring that they are constructive, timelimited, and thoughtfully focused, with clear, expedited processes for the consideration of exemptions,” he wrote.
The Biden transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday afternoon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University Professor Danielle S. Allen is exploring entering the 2022 race for governor of Massachusetts, she tweeted Monday.
“It’s time to lay a new and fair foundation for #OurCommonwealth,” she wrote. “With the right infrastructure beneath our feet, we can create a brighter future together. That’s why I’m exploring a run for Governor of Massachusetts.”
According to Allen’s campaign website, she plans to focus her platform on achieving “a fair and flourishing economy,” “educational excellence,” and “sustainability.” Her beliefs in justice, a foundation of health, and democratic innovation will also shape her possible candidacy.
Allen, who is a political theorist, has swiftly risen in the University’s ranks since she joined Harvard’s faculty in 2016. Just one year and a half after joining the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, then-President Drew G. Faust selected Allen as a University professor — the highest honor a professor can receive.
Earlier this year, Allen was named the 2020 recipient of the Kluge Prize from the Library of Congress, an international award for scholarly achievement in disciplines not covered by the Nobel Prize.
Allen — who holds Ph.D.s from the University of Cambridge and Harvard University — serves as Director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. Her academic work has focused on democratic theory and the history of political thought.
In a video announcing her campaign, Allen — a self-described “democracy advocate” and “policy innovator” — said the coronavirus, which exacerbated inequality in Massachusetts, served as the “last straw.”
“There’s issues of food insecurity, real inequity in school opportunities, climate issues in the community. I can see all the people in this state who are ready for change,” Allen said.
In April, Allen helped author the Roadmap to Pandemic Resilience, a comprehensive policy guide published by Harvard’s Safra Center for Ethics that promotes the use of testing, tracing, and supported isolation to combat the public health emergency.
Allen also said in the video that her family’s personal experiences with mass incarceration shape her views on society today.
“I grew up in this huge extended family, and some of us sort of got accelerated up on the elevators of opportunity, and others really got stuck in the worst kinds of entrapments,” Allen said.
Allen said she believes elected officials have a responsibility to make society more equitable.
“We all have a role to play in putting our society back on a track that really distributes opportunity fairly, and if our elected officers are not delivering that, then we need to make a change.”
“It’s time for us to lay a new and equitable foundation for our life together in this Commonwealth,” Allen added.
Allen will spend the next three months meeting with Massachusetts residents from across the state, per her campaign website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is gearing up to expand coronavirus testing and potentially obtain Covid-19 vaccine doses for its affiliates ahead of the spring semester, Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen said in an interview Monday.
Nguyen said health measures implemented during the fall semester were “very successful” in containing the spread of the virus on campus because Harvard affiliates adhered to safety guidelines and participated in frequent testing.
“Our community was very responsive to understanding that the risk was there,” he said. “By testing frequently, we were able to identify folks who were infected and then advise them to take themselves out of circulation.”
Though coronavirus cases among Harvard affiliates spiked in November, Nguyen said HUHS contact tracing attributed the surge to off-campus transmission — fueled by a nationwide rise in cases — rather than on-campus spread.
“By and large, the infections that we identified were people who were exposed off campus,” he said. “So the safety measures that were in place in our campus facilities and on our grounds were effective in keeping people who were here safe from being infected.”
Some undergraduates who lived on campus this fall told The Crimson last month they were confused by HUHS communications after initially testing positive for Covid-19, citing unclear procedures on how to handle subsequent contradictory test results and isolation.
Nguyen said he was aware of these student concerns, but explained that constantly evolving guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has made it difficult to maintain consistent protocols.
“Unfortunately, some of those changes happened right before Thanksgiving, right at the time when we were seeing increases in cases and when many of the students were being identified as having been exposed,” he said. “So you could have a situation where one person heard a recommendation one day, and then the next day the state has advised that we change our process — and in fact, that happened.”
With roughly half of all undergraduates invited to reside in Harvard’s dorms next semester, compared to roughly one-quarter in the fall, Nguyen said his office is preparing to test more people daily and anticipating the “very real possibility” that there will be a high positivity rate among returning students at the start of the spring term.
Still, he said the University’s plan to provide a single bedroom for each resident ensures there will be sufficient quarantine and isolation space if needed.
“The plan right now is for us to continue to use the spaces that had been used in the fall for isolation,” Nguyen said. “The isolation and quarantine spaces were more than adequate in the fall.”
Beyond Harvard’s gates, distribution and administration of a coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech — the first candidate to receive emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — began Monday in the United States. Another vaccine produced by Moderna Therapeutics is awaiting the same approval.
Nguyen said the University is planning “for the possibility of being given access to one or both of these vaccines.” He said HUHS submitted a formal request to procure doses from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for Harvard affiliates authorized to receive vaccination by the state.
In the meantime, Nguyen said his office is thinking ahead to operational challenges that immunization efforts may present.
“Right now we are looking at all of the potential logistics that would be involved, including storage, refrigeration, location, and potential safety measures that would be involved in administering the vaccine,” he said. “We’re not just sitting and waiting, but we’re actively planning on what we would need to do.”
Nguyen said once frontline hospital workers and long-term care facility staff and residents are immunized, he expects healthcare providers in the ambulatory setting — including HUHS — to be next in line.
“I don’t have an exact timeline yet,” he said. “But as soon as we know for sure, we would be letting the community know.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seventy-nine percent of Harvard College students plan to enroll for the remote spring semester, marking a small increase from the 77 percent who enrolled this fall, the Harvard College Open Data Project predicted in a report published Wednesday.
HODP, a student research group, began surveying undergraduates on their spring plans five days after Harvard announced Dec. 1 it would prioritize bringing seniors, currently enrolled juniors, students from far-flung timezones, and those without suitable learning environments back to campus. Juniors who took time off this fall are also eligible to petition for campus housing, and will be “accommodated to the greatest degree possible.”
Leo Saenger ’22 — who co-wrote the analysis with Thuan H. Tran ’23 — said HODP undertook a similar survey project this past fall, garnering responses from around a quarter of the student body. This semester, HODP collected 792 responses, a sample size that represents roughly 12 percent of undergraduates.
“I would say with over 10 percent of the student body, we can feel reasonably confident in the numbers,” Saenger said.
Their analysis of the results found that not all seniors and juniors intend to take classes this spring, despite being invited back to campus. Eighty-four percent of seniors and 74 percent of juniors indicated being extremely or somewhat likely to enroll this spring.
Even fewer of them, however, plan to petition to live in Harvard’s dorms, with only 50 percent of seniors and 40 percent of juniors expressing an intent to return to campus. The figure is slightly higher for the subset of juniors who enrolled this fall, 57 percent of whom plan to live in residence.
Many juniors and seniors are planning to live off campus in Cambridge or the Greater Boston area, according to the survey. Some students told The Crimson earlier this month that they preferred to maintain autonomy over their lifestyles by securing an independent apartment with friends.
Some sophomores and freshmen have told The Crimson they are disappointed Harvard would not prioritize inviting them back to campus this spring. The HODP report revealed that freshmen and sophomores can expect their enrolled class sizes to shrink by 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively, suggesting that even more people in their classes plan to take time off this semester compared to the fall.
The majority of those who took a leave this past fall plan to extend their time away from Harvard, the survey found. Only 21 percent of respondents who did not enroll this semester indicated they intend to re-enroll in the spring. Freshmen on leave had to take a full year off, and thus are not eligible to come back in the spring.
Harvard required all undergraduates, including those who are not returning and those who are planning to learn remotely, to submit a spring term confirmation form by Monday noting whether they intend to enroll and request campus housing.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a Monday interview that the HODP survey should provide the “beginnings of some usable information” to determine enrollment and housing numbers.
However, Khurana said without a “crystal ball,” it is impossible to know how these figures will change as students finalize their decisions.
“One of the things I just need to remind myself all the time is that the initial waves of data are not always clean,” he said.
Khurana acknowledged that the spring 2021 decision may have come too late for some students who had already signed leases for off-campus apartments or accepted full-time offers for the spring. In deciding when to release its plans, the College sought to balance the imperatives of having the “best and latest information” and giving students sufficient time to make an informed decision, he said.
“It’s completely understandable that people would want that information sooner. We tried to do it as best as we could,” Khurana said. “I know this is really difficult with respect to having to make decisions in a matter of just a couple of weeks.”
He also said the College plans to be flexible and supportive of students during their decision-making process by eliminating housing cancellation fees this spring.
“As an institution that often makes decisions about calendars years in advance, including where people can know when their commencement is going to be when they get into Harvard, this has been incredibly challenging for everyone,” Khurana said.
“I’m just so grateful to people's flexibility and understanding that so many people are just doing their best in conditions of much higher levels of uncertainty and ambiguity than we ordinarily operated,” he added.
Saenger agreed that the HODP survey cannot perfectly predict the future, given undergraduates’ fluctuating plans.
“Even if we were to survey 100 percent of the student body, we wouldn’t have 100 percent certainty about what the final enrollment numbers will be, since people will change their minds,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard released the findings of an external review into the University's police department Tuesday that recommended both long-term, philosophical reforms and immediate procedural changes to the department.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced the external review in June on the heels of public outrage over Harvard University Police Department officers monitoring a Black Lives Matter protest in Boston and longstanding criticisms of the department’s culture more broadly. The review was conducted by 21CP Solutions, an organization comprised of law enforcement experts who help to reform policing.
In the report, 21CP offered two primary recommendations. The first urges the University to engage in a “community-driven,” “stakeholder-informed” process of redefining public safety at Harvard.
The other primary recommendation suggests the University and HUPD consider more immediate changes, focused on five areas: strategic management, policies and procedures, information sharing, communication and transparency, and supporting relationships through administration and management.
The suggested reforms include creating a data and performance dashboard that publishes HUPD’s policing activity for review by the public; creating a department diversity and inclusion plan; and partnering with Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services to respond to certain calls.
21CP wrote that HUPD should create a two-year plan for implementing those changes.
The report calls on Harvard to create a “diverse, active and engaged” advisory board or oversight committee, which would provide HUPD “guidance” and serve as an accountability mechanism, per the report.
Harvard Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp confirmed in a Tuesday interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, that the University will create two groups — a HUPD Advisory Board and a Facilitating Committee. The former will provide “guidance” and “feedback” to the department, while the latter is designed to “clearly define the Harvard community’s expectations with regards to safety and well-being,” she said.
The Advisory Board is expected to convene by March 31, and the Facilitating Committee will convene April 30, according to Lapp.
The report draws on internal documents pertaining to the police department’s administration, recruitment and hiring practices, and HUPD’s internal accountability process in addition to interviews with University affiliates.
Between July and September 2020, 21CP spoke with 110 affiliates — faculty, staff, students, and administrators — about their experiences with and views of HUPD, the report states. Among those 110 participants were affiliates from underrepresented backgrounds, BGLTQ individuals; and HUPD personnel and staff.
21CP wrote, however, that the document is not a “comprehensive report” into HUPD. The group stresses that Harvard tasked the group to conduct a review of the police department’s policies and internal culture, in addition to its interactions with Harvard affiliates.
A comprehensive assessment of the department, in contrast, would need to consider additional factors, such as evaluating the use of “force and stop” data and the integrity of internal accountability mechanisms. The report emphasizes that it is not “exhaustive” with respect to all of the ways HUPD “could or should” change.
The report comes as the University continues to search for a new chief of police after longtime chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley announced over the summer that he will retire by the end of the calendar year.
