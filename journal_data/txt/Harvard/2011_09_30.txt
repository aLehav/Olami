After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s endowment recently posted an impressive 21.4 percent growth to $32 billion in fiscal year 2011 thanks to investments made by the Harvard Management Company, the University’s asset management firm. Although the fund underperformed the S&P 500 index, HMC’s returns were 1.2 percent ahead of the portfolio benchmark.
However, in June, the Oakland Institute, an independent California-based policy think tank, released a report alleging that HMC and other university endowment managers had invested in  Emergent Asset Management. Emergent, an alternative investment fund comprised of private equity and hedge fund strategies, often makes agricultural and real-estate investments in developing regions such as Africa. The Oakland Institute report alleges that Emergent takes advantage of arbitrage opportunities in Africa such as buying land and selling it at a higher price when demand is increased or by cultivating crops solely for export. Oakland Institute Director Anuradha Mittal has claimed that such strategies result in food shortages and ultimately utilize lax property laws to exploit indigenous farmers.
At the current stage, we do not have adequately available evidence to consider either HMC or Emergent at fault for the purported economic wrongdoings outlined in the Oakland Institute report. Without substantial proof that Emergent’s investment strategy results in land grabbing, we have no basis to condone the criticisms made by the Oakland Institute and Mittal.
We must acknowledge, however, that as Harvard’s endowment manager, HMC is responsible for both the financial and social implications of their investment decisions. HMC must always be cognizant of the impact of their asset allocation, and as Harvard students, we have the right to hold them to high ethical standards.
HMC, a fund connected so deeply with the basic operations and maintenance of Harvard, should not uphold a practice of facilitating economic abuse in developing nations. Harvard’s research facilities, extensive financial aid, prolific faculty, and vast resources should not come at the price of third-world exploitation. One of Harvard’s core purposes is to ensure the betterment of society by creating the leaders necessary to enact social change. HMC should thus be wary of reversing the strides that we have made to promote positive growth and economic advancement in historically disadvantaged countries.
In general, HMC’s stated intent to move from risky investments such as domestic equities to more stable assets such as real estate is positive because it safeguards Harvard’s endowment from potentially debilitating losses. However, when considering the entire scope of its investment strategy, HMC must ensure that these low-risk acquisitions are socially responsible. In the 1980’s, Harvard’s decision to divest from South Africa prevented financial enablement from reaching the apartheid government. In the same fashion, today, HMC must remain vigilant in making decisions that assist rather than exploit developing nations.
“Land grabs” as highlighted by Mittal and the Oakland Institute are not just the problem of investment funds. In the African countries where agri-fund exploitation occurs, a large part of the responsibility lies with the governments of some African nations who legitimize such practices. We must hold not only those who invest in these properties responsible, but also the institutional systems that make these abuses possible.
Ultimately, HMC must perform extensive due diligence on these investments in order to ensure that the mission of Harvard is not undercut by ill-allocated assets. The verdict on Emergent is still unclear, but in an increasingly global investment world, the issues like this will come up in the future. HMC should take this moment to reaffirm a commitment to corporate social responsibility in the developing world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I hate being asked what I did this past summer. It’s stale chatter which I, too, am guilty of employing as an early-semester conversation starter, but I much prefer the superior replacements that emerge in late-September: “What courses are you taking?”, “Do you have Fridays off?”, “When do your midterms start?”, and, my personal favorite, “Remind me what you’re concentrating in.”
This fall, however, I have repelled discussing the subject of summer even more than usual. I quickly inform my fellow conversationalist that I interned at a television news station, to which he inevitably follows up: “What was that like?”
It was a great experience. I developed a deeper appreciation for the media industry. I developed several new skills.  I worked with talented, kind, and intelligent people.
(Oh, and by the way, the show I was working on was canceled.)
A barrage of questions follows. “So basically, as soon as you got there, the show was canceled?” “Well, I don’t think it was exactly causal.” “Were you really the world’s first laid-off summer intern?” “Well, when you put it that way…”
During our meeting the day we were canceled, our executive producer informed us that we would be having guests join us that morning. I took this to mean that, much like in elementary school when the principal came to observe class, the guests wanted to see how we conducted ourselves during the workday.
I was wrong. The “guests” were, in fact, from the human resources department at the station. They informed us that as part of programming changes occurring across the company, our show would no longer be produced after August.
I was disappointed that the show was canceled. It was an excellent program, and I wondered why the news industry didn’t reward smart television. But being laid off as an intern added new meaning to the phrase, “learning experience.” I learned that stability is rare in an industry I was thinking of entering after college. I acquired different skills and took on additional production responsibilities as some of my colleagues peeled off and found new work. Internships offer students exposure to an industry and the opportunity to develop skills. For me, being laid off only added to that end.
But that was only because of college. The unreliability of the television business didn’t yet matter to me. I knew, come August, where I would be: My biggest challenges would be moving in during a hurricane-cum-tropical storm and putting those pesky bed risers under my Harvard-issued bedframe. Because of school, being laid off became another “learning moment.” Yes, some of my friends would come home from their “junior summers” with an offer in hand, and I would return with only a pink slip. But at least I would have a whole year to figure it out.
So I didn’t feel bad for myself. I was lucky. Going into the summer, I knew my internship was temporary anyway; learning extra production skills was just an unexpected bonus. For my colleagues, however, the show’s cancelation was a permanent reality. They would have to search for work and still feed their kids. And they would have to do so during a jobs crisis they had reported on all summer.
And they handled it with grace. They were a group of people who, despite the insecurity of their own employment, still came to work with high morale and the desire to create a good product. My coworkers were willing teachers to me and supportive friends to each other. In that lay the most important lesson of all. They were committed to the show—and to their colleagues—despite the incentives not to be, and became my role models as a result. It was merely another benefit of my surprising summer, beyond learning how to code video and edit clips.
I will hopefully take it with me whenever I have a tough exam or a grilling interview or a bad day at work. As I learned during that morning meeting early this summer, there are certainly more difficult conversations than those boring ones that take place at the beginning of a new semester.

In the past several months, American cultural life has exhibited a curious nostalgia for the AIDS epidemic, which decimated the gay community in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The revival of Larry Kramer’s “Normal Heart”, which won the Tony for Best Revival of a Play, and a new documentary, “We Were Here”, which excavates narratives about the epidemic in San Francisco, are only two of many prominent examples.
As one might expect, coverage of both of these events focused primarily on the historical project that they exemplify: a kind of cultural preservation, a revived vigil, in an era often labeled “post-AIDS.” But throughout articles and reviews, one sees another strain emerge: the idea that young people in the United States today “have no clue” about the epidemic, in the words of one Bay Area filmmaker quoted in a review of “We Were Here.”
Do we “have no clue”? Certainly, many young people—both straight and gay—don’t personally know anyone who died from the disease, nor have they heard the countless stories of loss and suffering that marked the worst of the plague years. Our generation has grown up, for the most part, in the world of “living with AIDS,” of understanding HIV in the United States as a chronic condition, managed and monitored. In the imaginations of many young people, perhaps AIDS figures primarily as an African problem, over there but most definitely not here.
To be sure, this is cluelessness of a sort. But American young people reveal a surprising consciousness of the disease in other ways. At Harvard, safe sex is widely practiced; it’s certainly the norm, if not perfectly so. The condom’s small ritual—the pause in intimacy, the tearing open, the unrolling—is one instance of implied knowledge of HIV/AIDS, or at least an acknowledgment that the “pre-condom” era, in which fevered, unprotected promiscuity spread this disease of feverish night sweats, is over.
This tangible example accompanies a range of more abstract anxieties and attitudes that follow from the epidemic. If plague can be said to teach lessons, then the AIDS epidemic shows with terrifying precision that sex and love, the body’s double quintessence, can destroy the body. We are left with a fear of the body, a distrust of intimacy, and a longing for a world in which risk was an excitement, not a form of fatality. A song like Cher’s “Believe” (released in 1998) expresses these anxieties over club-ready production, asking, “Do you believe in life after love?” There is a beautiful irony in imagining the club kids of the late 90s, lithe and drug-flushed after their elders were ravaged by plague, dancing to these words—embodying, after all, an answer to this question.
In less bodily ways, the AIDS epidemic has become part of our consciousness. The gay marriage movement, with its recent success in New York, can be understood in part as a response to the experience of gay men who were denied the ability to visit their sick partners in hospital. One can imagine the need for legal recognition of gay relationships arising with new force beside the body of a lover sick from AIDS—and this image remains an indelible component of the political movement’s emotional core.
The continuing influence of the epidemic is at the center of the world in which the Harvard students of today grew up: We can feel its legacies, in ways both explicit and implicit, in our sex, our politics, and our culture. Perhaps, then, we are not entirely clueless about the epidemic—even if our knowledge is of a more ulterior, unconscious nature.
None of this is intended as an argument against teaching or learning about the epidemic; on the contrary, we must do so if we want to understand the forces that continue to shape us. This summer, I received an Artist Development Fellowship from the Office for the Arts at Harvard to study the epidemic and write poems about the issues that I have discussed here. I learned many things from this experience, but the most urgent understanding I carried forward from the summer is that people of our generation should begin considering their experiences from new perspectives: that of the body’s frailty as a starting point of self-understanding, of desire as “a deadly force” (in the words of the great contemporary poet D. A. Powell), of growing up in a world ravaged and remade by plague. Even more, these insights should spur us to speak, write, and create.
Writing history and making art are two approaches to advancing this mission, but they are far from the only ways. This project is necessarily both personal and public, and we should take full advantage of the multiplicity of possibilities that this dual identity offers. At the most basic level, we should talk about AIDS—not only as a historical phenomenon, but also as a political, social, and cultural force—with our parents and our politicians, our friends and our lovers.
We all have an obligation to engage with the AIDS epidemic, whether we are among those who were there or those who were not. An anagram of the disease’s acronym should be our imperative: AIDS transformed into SAID.

The USA PATRIOT Act has done much for national security efforts in the ten years since it was passed. Inter-agency cooperation has increased, criminal laws regarding the financing of terrorism have been strengthened, and investigation techniques have been modernized. As a result, U.S. law enforcement is better equipped to combat the technological and dissipated nature of terrorist threats. These achievements have been made in concert with a series of productive and healthy public debates concerning the compromising of civil liberties for the sake of national security. These debates must be allowed to continue in order to ensure that the USA PATRIOT Act remains an effective deterrent against terrorism. It is essential that all details relevant to the manner in which the USA PATRIOT Act is enforced be revealed as soon as possible, so as to minimize any possible injury such a disclosure may have to the effectiveness of the law.
Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Mark Udall (D-CO), both members of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), recently called attention to how the Department of Justice may be misleading the public as to how the USA PATRIOT Act is being enforced. In a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., they contend that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) has interpreted Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act in a manner different from its commonly understood purpose. Section 215 is referred to by the Department of Justice as the “business records” clause, since it allows the government to apply to FISC in order to seize records or information pertaining to a private individual who can be linked to a national security case.
Members of the SSCI are informed of such uses of Section 215. In their letter, Senators Wyden and Udall state that rulings of the FISC have interpreted Section 215 in a way that is very different from the Department of Justice’s characterization of Section 215 as being “like a grand jury subpoena.” Rather, they assert that it is being used to access the private information of citizens not linked to espionage or intelligence cases, in such a way that “When the American people find out how their government has secretly interpreted the Patriot Act, they will be stunned and they will be angry.” Such a claim that the law is being loosely interpreted by the FISC is also corroborated by how the American Civil Liberties Union reported that “business records” seizures jumped from 21 instances in 2009 to 96 instances in 2010.
It is key to the integrity of the United States’ legal process that the explicit manner in which laws are enforced by the government is made public. The precedent exists for the government’s responsibility to clarify as much as possible the way in which the government intends to enforce laws. Perhaps most famously, the majority legal opinion resulting from the U.S. Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona set out clear guidelines as to how criminal suspects must be informed of their Fifth and Sixth amendment rights. The manner in which the FISC’s legal opinions have interpreted Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act is similarly pertinent to Fourth Amendment rights. American citizens must be made aware of what the government determines to be a reasonable search and seizure, so that they may remain confident that they are safe from “unreasonable searches and seizures.”
In their letter, the Senators mention how the Department of Justice has stated that “Section 215 is not a secret law, nor has it been implemented under secret legal opinions by the Justice Department.” But they also note how such a statement is misleading, since the NSA General Counsel testified in July of this year that important interpretations of Section 215 are contained in classified legal opinions of FISC. It is crucial that the government cease political doublespeak in order to continue relying on “secret law.” If the relevant interpretations of Section 215 are declassified, the intelligence community can capitalize on their recent successes in order to strengthen the legality of the national security apparatus.
If details of how the USA PATRIOT Act is currently being secretly interpreted by the FISC are as contentious as Senators Udall and Wyden claim, they are liable to be leaked in a manner similar to previous indiscretions taken with domestic intelligence gathering. The ensuing public reaction would not be productive for U.S. national security interests. Given the law’s proven track record, President Obama was right to sign a four-year extension of the PATRIOT Act earlier this year. But in order to prevent the debilitation of what has proven to be one of the more effective tools in the war on terror, he should also make public FISC’s secret legal opinions in which Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act is interpreted.

Country music, hot air balloon rides, and Thomas the Tank Engine may not sound like a typical Oktoberfest, but Harvard Square has redefined the German tradition with its own annual celebration, taking place this Sunday.
The 33rd annual festival, expected to draw 150,000 people, will begin with the HONK! parade of local musicians and community groups that departs from Davis Square at noon and ends in Harvard Square at 1 p.m.
The streets of Harvard Square will feature six stages of musical entertainment, including alternative, rock, pop, country, and folk music. The super crosswalk at the heart of the Square will host the main stage, while others will be along Church Street and other nearby streets.
Over 200 stalls will also be scattered throughout the Square, selling crafts, clothing, artwork, and food. True to the German tradition, three beer gardens will offer beer to visitors.
Other entertainment for guests includes hot air balloon rides from the Cambridge Common and a Thomas the Tank Engine train ride for children.
Frank Cardullo, owner of the since-closed Wurst House and founder of Cardullo’s Gourmet Shoppe, started the tradition 33 years ago to connect to the theme of his German restaurant.
“He took the ambiance of his restaurant out to the street,” said Donez J. Cardullo, president of Cardullo’s and Frank’s granddaughter.
The Wurst House, now the location of Citizens Bank, was a popular restaurant where business people used to hold meetings, according to Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson.
Sheldon Cohen—founder of Out of Town News and former HSBA director—and other members of the HSBA assisted Cardullo with the first event. The HSBA has continued to organize Oktoberfest since.
“We’re delighted to continue the tradition to a whole new group of people, even though we don’t have an authentic German restaurant in Harvard Square,” Jillson said.
Donez Cardullo said the event used to focus more on German traditions. One year, Frank Cardullo organized a showing of Clydesdale horses, popularly used in Budweiser commercials.
Cardullo’s grandchildren, who now run his store, used to host a stall with international food featured at Cardullo’s. But they decided last year to sell only authentic German food.
“Even though Cardullo’s has food from around the world, we decided to go back to the German roots. We wanted to give a nod to our grandpa,” Cardullo said.
The festival will have to adapt this year to the construction on JFK Street, forcing some vendors to Eliot Street, beside the farmers’ market outside the Charles Hotel. Traffic down Mount Auburn Street will also be diverted.
The tradition’s popularity has spiked since the early festivities that drew 10,000 people to the Square.
“It’s getting people into the Square to realize that we are still thriving and changing and tell them to come down more often,” Cardullo said.

Faced with fundraising difficulties and tough competition, Mayor of Newton Setti Warren announced Thursday that he will drop out of the race for the U.S. Senate. Warren’s announcement narrows the field to six Democratic candidates and leaves a clear path to the nomination for Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren.
“I got in to this race for one reason and one reason only—to beat Scott Brown,” Mr. Warren said at a press conference outside his home. “And I am getting out now for one reason and one reason only—because I no longer believe I have a clear path to victory in this race.”
Mr. Warren also referenced the “long financial and political odds” he has faced in his run for Senate on his campaign website. His concession came on the heels of a Public Policy Polling survey in which he received the support of only 1 percent of Massachusetts Democrats. And in the same poll Elizabeth Warren—who has emerged as a clear front runner among Democratic candidates since announcing her bid a week ago—received the support of 55 percent of Massachusetts Democratic primary voters.
City Year co-founder Alan A. Khazei ’83 was next runner up, earning 9 percent of voters’ support. Former candidate for lieutenant governor Tom Conroy received 7 percent, Marisa DeFranco and Bob Massie each received 2 percent, and Herb Robinson earned 1 percent.
In the matchup between Democratic candidates and Republican incumbent Scott Brown, Warren even overtook Brown in PPP’s survey, edging out Brown 46 to 44 percent. But Warren’s two-point lead falls within the poll’s 3.5 percent margin of error.
Elizabeth Warren released a statement Thursday praising Setti Warren.
“Setti and I have had some long conversations about what is happening to America’s families and what kind of changes we want to see,” she wrote. “Every time we’ve talked, I’ve been struck by his good heart and quick mind. Setti has served our country, our state and his community with great distinction and honor. He ran a positive and energetic campaign, focused on the importance of shared responsibility and a common purpose—a message that is important to all of us.”
Mr. Warren said that he was confident that the nominee from the remaining pool of Democrat contenders will defeat Brown.
“I am certain that one of these Democrats will emerge as our nominee and will beat Scott Brown in November 2012.”
Mr. Warren will continue to serve as mayor of Newton.
Khazei, who ran in the special election in 2010 but lost to Mass. Attorney General Martha Coakley in the primary, represents the most significant challenge to Warren within the Democratic field, but he lacks the fundraising ability and the name recognition of Warren, who made a name for herself as a prominent advocate for consumer rights and Wall Street reform.
Brown won an upset victory in a special election in 2010 after the death of longtime Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, beating Coakley. Brown remains a popular political figure in Massachusetts, but many observers say that the race between Warren and Brown may be hotly contested and that the race may represent the best chance for Democrats to pick up a seat in the Senate during an election cycle that is unlikely to favor the party.

With about 1,900 undergraduates enrolled in its courses this fall, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is using every bit of available space, from classrooms and laboratories to the hallways of Pierce Hall.
Administrators, who expect enrollment to continue to grow, believe that repurposing existing space and potential future construction can help relieve the strain.
In the long term, they are pinning their hopes on a new SEAS building that will replace the bridge between Pierce and Cruft Halls—the hub of engineering at Harvard—to accommodate classrooms, labs, and support services.
“We cannot not do it,” SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray said of the “Cornerstone Building,” which is currently in the planning stages.
But SEAS is also working on a number of short-term projects to increase work space for students.
Seniors in Engineering Sciences 100: Engineering Design Projects—the capstone course that all Engineering Sciences concentrators must take to graduate—will begin using a brand-new design space on the ground floor of Maxwell Dworkin within the next two weeks.
The course, which saw enrollment double to 31 this year, previously shared space in Pierce Hall with another course. Students are cramped—particularly as they begin building their prototypes.
“It’s just in time,” said ES100 professor Robert J. Wood.
The new teaching lab replaces the Maxwell Dworkin café that was shut down in 2009.
The space is equipped to facilitate all aspects of the design process, according to Anas Chalah, director of instructional laboratories at SEAS—from creating an initial design on the computer to building a prototype and fabricating the final product.
“There’s a lot of flexibility built in,” said SEAS Director of Capital Projects Pamela C. Redfern, describing features such as mobile tables, writable walls, and power connections in the ceiling.
Wood cites the space’s custom-made, transparent door—the only aspect of the space that is incomplete—as another important feature that will allow undergraduates to see and learn from the work of their peers.
“I think it would [foster] a greater sense of unity amongst all of the concentrators, for sophomores and juniors to walk by ... and look forward to that,” he said.
The desire to promote community has motivated the creation of an adjoining common space to the teaching lab specifically for the Harvard College Engineering Society. Plans are also underway for an Applied Math lounge area.
The new lounge, slated to be on the top floor of Pierce Hall, is currently in the “thinking phase,” according to SEAS Executive Dean Fawwaz Habbal, and should be complete next summer.
“We have this very large concentration and the requirements of the concentration are such that you could have two students who never take a course together,” said Margo S. Levine, assistant director for undergraduate studies in Applied Mathematics. “That creates this sort of very dispersed community.”
She said she hopes the space will be a site for social events, collaborative learning, and teaching opportunities.
“If you want to do it right, you will need [a] significant amount of active learning,” he said of SEAS’ teaching philosophy.
SEAS’ rethinking of “active learning” is not unique. Universities across the country, including MIT, are experimenting with classroom design in an effort to optimize student experience, according to Habbal.
He estimated that SEAS has spent about $5 million on teaching labs in the last five years, an investment that has tripled the amount of student lab space in Pierce Hall.
“We’re utilizing every space that one can imagine can be utilized,” he said, adding that teaching labs even overflow into the hallway and several administrators have already been moved to the Northwest Science Building. “One last frontier is the basement of Maxwell Dworkin.”
In fact, that space will soon be filled too. Electrical engineering lab space in the basement is poised to double by the spring term to accommodate growth in ES50 and ES1.

Twenty-three years ago, Darryl T. Gwynne of the University of Toronto and David C. Rentz, a retired entomologist, published a research paper on beetles and their attempts to mate with beer bottles on the side of the road in western Australia.
The beetles perceived the brown color and reflection of the beer bottles as characteristics of a giant female beetle and wasted sperm on failed efforts to mate with the glass products.
After decades of waiting, the scientists finally received the “serendipitous” biology prize during the 21st Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony in Sanders Theatre Thursday night, Gwynne said.
“Personally, I think it’s good to communicate what I do as a scientist to non-scientists,” Rentz said. “And humor is a good way to do that.”
Hosted by the organization Improbable Research, the Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony honors scientific research that makes people laugh and think, according to the Improbable Research website. A satiric take on the Nobel Prize ceremonies, the Ig Nobel Ceremony invites Nobel laureates and other researchers to participate in a science-themed comedy performance.
The event was also co-hosted by the Harvard Computer Society, Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association, and Harvard-Radcliffe Society of Physics Students.
The theme of this year’s ceremony was “chemistry,” a word that prompted applause and whooping from the audience throughout the ceremony. Previous themes have included “bacteria” and “redundancy.”
Marc Abrahams, the editor of the Improbable Researchers’ Annals of Improbable Research magazine, served as the emcee for the evening.
“If you didn’t win an Ig Nobel Prize this year—but especially if you did—better luck next year,” Abrahams said at the end of the ceremony.
The ceremony also recognized researchers from Japan who found the ideal density of airborne wasabi and scientists from the Netherlands who found that people have a tendency to make fewer impulsive decisions when they have the urge to urinate.
“The award is also a recognition of creativity and originality, and that’s something that’s important to scientists,” said Mirjam A. Tuk, lead author of “Inhibitory Spillover: Increased Urination Urgency Facilitates Impulse Control in Unrelated Domains.”
After hearing about the event from his academic advisor, Ari D. Brenner ’14 volunteered to run the press desk for the ceremony.
“This show highlights scientific achievements that are pretty atypical,” Brenner said. “But I think it glorifies advancement in general. It’s also about sparking innovation for innovation’s sake.”
But not all attendees thought highly of the scientific achievements.
“I came to the ceremony because I wanted to see what not to do in science later in my life,” said Veronika Stelmakh, a third-year grad student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
No Ig Ceremony would be complete without Jim Bredt, a materials scientist who for the past 20 years has served as Ig Nobel’s human spotlight, which entails painting his entire body silver while sporting aluminum-colored bikini bottoms and shining a flashlight on people.
In addition to premiering “Chemists in a Coffee Shop,” a mini-opera that celebrated the chemistry of the caffeinated beverages, The Ig Nobel Ceremony also featured a series of “24/7 lectures.” Researchers described their studies in technical terms in 24 seconds and in simple colloquialisms in seven words.
Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of Illinois Kathryn B. H. Clancy condensed her study on vaginal pH into universal language.
“Leave your acidic vagina alone—don’t douche,” Clancy said.
Improbable Research will host the “Ig Informal Lectures” Saturday at MIT.

The cast bronze bell hanging in Memorial Church’s belfry will be indefinitely out of commission after cracking during the announcement of morning prayers on Thursday.
The crack was discovered when church staff called in professionals after noticing a change in the sound of the more than 65 year-old bell, which typically chimes at the start of every hour between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.
The experts told church staff that the bell cannot be easily repaired and suggested that it be sent to Pennsylvania to be reheated in an attempt to remove the crack, according to Memorial Church Epps Fellow Nathaniel P. Katz. If that effort is unsuccessful, the professionals suggested that the bell be melted down and eventually recast.
Katz said that the Church is considering installing a speaker to replace the bell’s hourly tolls in the interim period.
The two-ton bell was cast by the Taylor Bell foundry in 1926 and donated to the University in the 1930s by former University President A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, according to previous articles in The Crimson. Honoring students who died in World War I, its inscription reads, "In memory of voices that are hushed."
Since the bell’s installation, it has suffered a number of minor problems. In the 1970s, the clapper broke off and landed on the steps of Widener Library. The clapper broke free again in 1990, landing on a lower section of the church’s steeple, according to a story in The Crimson.
The late Peter J. Gomes, former Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister at Memorial Church, told The Crimson in 2006 that bells have a long history at Harvard that originates from the traditional use of bells at Oxford and Cambridge University to keep time.
"Christians have used bells for thousands of years. Time in western Christian civilization was a Christian concept. Days were marked by prayers," he said.

Raed H. Charafeddine, the first vice-governor of the Lebanese central bank, said in a speech Thursday that the Arab Spring has presented the opportunity for serious reform within Middle Eastern governments, a change that he argued would be instrumental in solving some of the region’s long-standing economic difficulties.
Charafeddine said that while accounts of the Arab Spring, the series of revolts that have toppled authoritarian governments across the Middle East, have placed disproportionate emphasis on the movement’s political aspects, the economic changes ushered in as a result of new governments will have important—if unnoticed so far—consequences.
The recent revolutions have been a source of inspiration in the region, but the accompanying instability has also contributed economic uncertainty. As one of the leading causes of the Arab uprisings, economic decline remains one of the major issues facing citizens across the Middle East, said Charafeddine, who spoke at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
“It’s a vicious circle,” he said.
Charafeddine shies away from the use of “Arab Spring” to define the uprisings and prefers the phrase “Arab Awakening.”
“The region has the potential to emerge from the ‘Arab Awakening’ to the desired ‘Arab Spring,’ not ‘chaos’ or ‘winter’ or ‘mess,’” he said.
The protests across the region have now stalled somewhat, and it remains unclear what is to be done about the still-floundering economy. Charafaddine, for one, has a few suggestions.
Reestablishing investor confidence through foreign aid and domestic job generation will be central, Charafeddine said. But Charafeddine’s primary interest is short-term economic success in the region that might serve as a beacon of hope.
Above all, Charafaddine emphasized the centrality of government reform across the region, which will, he said, lay the foundation for economic improvement. This time, the government must keep the people in mind, he said.
“Nothing is as constant as change, and today, change is essential for Arabs to claim the international acknowledgment they deserve,” said Richard J. Saliba ’15, who is from Lebanon.
But the issue is complicated by several challenges inherent to the region, Charafaddine said, not the least of which include deep-seated government corruption, a lack of economic diversification, and skyrocketing youth unemployment—issues that gave birth to the uprisings in the first place.
Although the G-8 summit last May promised up to $40 billion in aid to Egypt and Tunisia, little of that money has been delivered. Charafeddine said that foreign and non-governmental aid will be an important component in rebuilding, as both Egypt and Tunisia are currently in the midst of precarious transitions to democracy.
Charafeddine’s talk was part of the Belfer Center’s Middle East Initiative.

Peter A. Thiel, cofounder of Paypal and one of the initial investors in Facebook, encouraged students to look at life with a more definite vision for their long-term future during a talk at Harvard Business School on Thursday.
Thiel started off by sharing an anecdote about Facebook, recalling when, in 2006, Yahoo offered $1 billion to acquire the company.
In what Thiel considers to be the “single most important decision Facebook ever made,” CEO and founder Mark E. Zuckerberg did not sell his company. “There were many points when they could, but they never sold the company,” Thiel said.
At the time, Thiel argued in favor of the money, he said. But Zuckerberg, at age 22, offered the counter argument of “‘Why should I sell? I like this company,’” Thiel said.
Thiel praised Zuckerberg’s long-term outlook on life, which he described as “definite.”
The indefinite view, by contrast, is more common in American society. It describes a probabilistic outlook, by which people make choices without knowing what will happen to them, he said.
People who approach the world with a definite view in America, Thiel said, are “treated with mild contempt.”
But people in some countries adhere to more definite plans. “China has a very definite view of the future,” Thiel said. Among the Chinese, “there’s a sense of what China will look like in 20 years,” he said.
Compared to China, Thiel believes, the U.S. does not have any sense of what America will look like in the future—in terms of the government, or technology, or anything.
On an individual level, Thiel said people should have an idea of where they want to be in the long term. He advised having a 20-year plan, rather than a short-term plan for the immediate future.
He made an analogy to chess, in which the best players plan several steps ahead.
“In any given position, you want a plan,” he said.
Thiel was also critical of the social focus on college campuses, which he said is not conducive to fostering development.
He distinguished between two categories of development, based on what he described as buzz words: globalization, the spread of ideas, and technology, the generation of new ideas.
College is more negative for technology and more positive for globalization, he said.
“Globalization is copying things that work,” he said. “Technology is going from zero to one, doing new things.”

Harvard’s security guards confirmed in a vote late Wednesday night a new contract that guarantees a 15.3 percent wage increase over five years, an increased number of full-time jobs, and protection of their current health care coverage.
The contract comes after tense negotiations during which security guards threatened to strike after Securitas, the contractor that employs security guards for the University, proposed a less extensive health care plan than the one guards currently receive through their union. Security guards were outraged at the proposal and began circulating a petition expressing their willingness to strike over the new health care provisions. Over 80 percent of security guards signed the petition, which was then formally presented to their bargaining committee.
Leaders of SEIU Local 615, the union that represents Harvard security guards, said that the guards think the new contract is an excellent agreement. According to Local 615 Director of Higher Education Wayne M. Langley, the guards overwhelmingly voted to confirm the contract.
Langley added that there was a general air of celebration among the guards after the confirmation.
“Everybody is happy with the terms of the contract—they feel like their hard work and their struggles have paid off,” he said. “The guards have learned that if they stay united, if they stay focused, if they work as a team, that that produces better contracts.”
Security guards also emphasized the importance of solidarity in the negotiations process.
“Everybody came together to get things done,” said Harvard security guard Shawn Lynch. “It’s a really solid contract all the way through. We got everything we needed out of Securitas.”
Lynch also expressed relief over the fact that the negotiations came to a peaceful resolution and that guards were not forced to strike.
“I think that all of us [security guards] are happy that it did not come to that,” he said. “We definitely wanted a more peaceful resolution to this process, and that’s what we ended up getting—thanks to our bargaining committee.”
Despite the approval of the contract with Securitas, negotiations are not over for the guards. They are currently in the process of bargaining with the University for access to the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), which allows Harvard employees to take undergraduate and graduate courses at a reduced rate, sometimes for as little as $40. Currently, security guards are not eligible for TAP because they are contractors and not direct employees of the University. The new contract with Securitas stipulates that if the University agrees to fund the benefits, Securitas will provide access to TAP for guards.
While security guards do not have access to TAP, they can take part in the Bridge Program, which offers preparatory classes such as “English as a second language.”
Securitas could not be reached for comment, and the University has said that it does not comment on Securitas negotiations.

Natalie L. Jacewicz ’13 is captivated by lizards. She went all the way to the Dominican Republic to observe them in their natural habitat.
“My favorite part of researching is just watching the lizards,” she said. “It’s fascinating to become a part of the lizards’ world.”
In her study of Anolis lizards at the Losos Laboratory, Jacewicz seeks to answer both behavioral and physiological questions.
The Organismic and Evolutionary Biology concentrator began analyzing the morphology and conduct of juvenile lizards in the fall of her sophomore year. Anolis, the largest genus of lizards, includes several species of lizards that have developed in similar ways across the Greater and Lesser Antilles.
“If we see lizards evolving in the same way, it suggests strict rules for evolution,” Jacewicz said.
Over the summer, Jacewicz explored these evolutionary pressures in the Dominican Republic, where she studied juvenile lizards during lizard breeding season in late June and early July. Juvenile lizards, smaller and more elusive than their adult counterparts, serve as a model organism for evolutionary biology. After closely observing these creatures in groups of up to 120 lizards, Jacewicz compared the behavior and proportions of limb length, head width, and other body parts in adults and juveniles. Jacewicz is currently synthesizing her findings about the evolutionary development of juvenile lizards and aims to publish her work this year.
Though Jacewicz typically spends a few hours per week in her lab during the school year, she often worked 10 to 14 hours per day over the summer.
“The field work we did was very group-oriented,” said Thomas Sanger, a postdoctoral fellow at Losos Lab who has worked with Jacewicz since she began her scientific research. “She kept up with the grueling pace of work.”
Jacewicz’s scientific pursuits have motivated her to consider further research in the Caribbean over the upcoming summer. She would like to observe lizard behavior in urban areas, reflecting a longtime interest in an environment’s influence on an organism and conservation in general. Jacewicz said that her passion for conservation comes from experiences she had during her childhood in a rural part of Tennessee where she witnessed the rapid construction of parking lots and buildings that subsequently went unused.
“Development spiraled out of control,” Jacewicz said.
Accordingly, she serves as a representative for Harvard’s Resource Efficiency Program. In addition, Jacewicz is an active member of the Mock Trial team, which she views as a way to develop her analytical thinking and consider the steps needed to translate scientific research into societal change.
Jacewicz said she is considering going to graduate school or law school and is contemplating the fields of alternative energy and environmental law.
“I know whatever I do, whether with graduate school or with law, I would want to explore conservation,” she said.

Researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics are turning their attention to something even the most advanced telescopes can’t detect: the art in their science.
As technology generates better representations of far-off astronomical events, the Aesthetics and Astronomy project is studying how the public reacts to these images. By determining whether public interest in astronomy is more aesthetic or scientific in nature, the project hopes to develop effective ways of communicating astronomical discoveries to the general public, according to visualization coordinator Kimberly Kowal Arcand, who leads the project along with CfA astrophysicists Jay A. Bookbinder and Randall Smith.
The popularity of websites such as NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day shows that celestial images are compelling to the general public, but A&A researchers initially thought that this attention was solely aesthetic in nature.
The results of surveys and focus groups conducted by A&A researchers, however, contradicted this theory. People responded more positively to images that were accompanied by an explanation, suggesting curiosity about the nature of the celestial event or object pictured, according to Smith.
“There is a devaluing when you separate out function and form,” Arcand said.
The A&A researchers said they believe that an understanding of the scientific nature of astronomical imagery can let people more fully appreciate its beauty—and conversely, that its aesthetic appeal can increase appreciation of the science.
With this fundamental principle, the A&A project has begun to develop and test ways of further engaging the public with astronomical images, such as the inclusion of captions, question-and-answer formatted information, and what Smith calls the “Cocktail Format”—short, memorable facts that a viewer might later drop at a cocktail party.
“We are trying to find ways of livening it up, bringing the viewer in,” Smith said.
While these fun facts can be entertaining as well as informative, the project also seeks to address misunderstandings between the astrophysics community and the general public. For example, A&A researchers found that most people associate the color red with high temperatures, while most astrophysicists understand that blue represents the higher temperature in most deep space images.
The A&A project hopes to develop ways of closing this knowledge gap between experts and non-experts, Smith said. By tying the science of their work with something accessible to everybody—aesthetics—the researchers are bringing the celestial ever closer to home.

Harvard researchers have recently uncovered some of the biological mechanisms underlying the traumatic brain injuries caused by bomb explosions, suggesting future avenues for improved treatment and therapy.
Led by Kevin Kit Parker, a bioengineering and applied physics professor at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the scientists showed that the overactivity of proteins called integrins, which can be caused by the physical force of an explosion, plays a key role in TBI by causing networks of neurons to disconnect from each other.
Preliminary studies in the lab have also shown that the administration of drugs that inhibit integrin overactivity immediately after a blast can help to protect neural tissue—a finding that the scientists hope will translate into clinically-used therapies in the near future, according to researcher Borna E. Dabiri ’07.
Parker, a combat veteran in Afghanistan, said he initially worked in cardiac research but was motivated to redirect his research in order to help his fellow soldiers and friends. The current lack of understanding about TBIs makes the recovery process difficult for many victims, he said.
“The idea that these guys are getting wounded like this and what their future health might look like kills me,” Parker said. “I can’t look at these guys and not do something.”
In the past, the physical symptoms of soldiers following explosions were commonly attributed to psychological trauma, according to Christian R. Macedonia, the medical science advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
But Dabiri said that recent studies have shown that the impact of the blast can also cause physical brain damage, with later complications such as early-onset Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease.
“It dawned on me that the blast concussions were not just from people being frightened,” said Macedonia, who felt first-hand the physical aftereffects of a blast while serving as a combat surgeon in Iraq.
“I wasn’t fearful,” he said about his own explosion experience. “But I also was not right in the head, and my ears continued to ring for days.”
Parker and Macedonia are currently part of the Gray Team, a group of scientist-veterans that routinely take two-week long missions to Afghanistan. Based on information and testimonials from U.S. military personnel on the ground, the scientists give recommendations relating to TBI injury and care.
Though Parker’s work on TBIs now receives support from the government, he said he is grateful to Harvard for providing the necessary funding for the initial stages of the research, which was considered a very new field at the time.
“I am very appreciative of Harvard’s financial position,” Parker said. “It empowered me to get this work started while we waited for the government to get organized.”

Biology professor Hopi E. Hoekstra and astronomy professor David Charbonneau have been selected as the first-ever recipients of the Fannie Cox Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching, an award that recognizes teachers who inspire students in introductory-level science courses.
The prize, which consists of a $10,000 personal award and $40,000 of research support, was endowed this past summer by a donation from Harvard alumnus Gardner Hendrie ’54.
A committee of senior faculty members from various scientific fields, headed by biology professor Richard M. Losick, collectively decided on the awardees.
“We collectively circulated names, and Hopi and David just surfaced,” Losick said.
Both Hoekstra, who teaches Organismic and Evolutionary Biology 53: “Evolutionary Biology,” and Charbonneau, who teaches Astronomy 16: “Stellar and Planetary Astronomy,” received Q guide ratings above 4.5 when they last taught their classes.
“I start off every lecture by asking a question to get the class interested,” said Charbonneau, who, as a child, would feed his curiosity by traveling out of his home city with a star map.
Hoesktra, who used to collect owl pellets and construct mouse skeletons as a kid, agreed with the power of curiosity and active involvement. “Enthusiasm and passion for science are contagious,” she said.
Confirming her statement, Hoekstra’s OEB 53 has seen enrollment grow from 34 students in 2008 to 86 in 2011.
“It’s impossible not to become excited about science when you hear her squeal with glee—quite literally—upon turning to a page in the mammalogy textbook with a picture of some adorable rodent,” said former OEB 53 student Joshua H. St. Louis ’09.
Charbonneau has been similarly credited for popularizing the Astrophysics concentration. Only three students took Astronomy 16 in the year before he began teaching in 2008, and that number grew to 63 students in 2010.
Despite being a leading scientist in the study of exoplanets, Charbonneau stressed the importance of balancing his teaching duties with his research.
“I know that my responsibility is to teach and mentor students,” he said.
Hoekstra, too, describes her greatest challenge as the task of allocating equal time and effort to working with students and working in her lab.
At an institution where professors are often criticized for being inaccessible, Hoekstra and Charbonneau also make a point of getting to know their students personally.
“I love the faculty-student dinners,” Hoekstra said. “Last year, a couple of dinners overlapped and I couldn’t go to all of them ... That was really sad!”
Similarly, Charbonneau said he has kept in contact with many of the students from his first Astronomy 16 class in 2008, most of whom are now seniors.
“It’s a delight to see what they have achieved,” he said.

Researchers at the Harvard Medical School have discovered new genetic evidence supporting the theory that the migration of modern humans to Asia occurred in multiple waves.
The results of the study—a joint effort between scientists at HMS and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany—contradict previous studies arguing that the dispersion of human populations to Asia occurred in a single wave.
The researchers identified separate migration waves to east Asia, southeast Asia, and Oceania by looking for traces of genetic material from Denisovans—a previously unknown group of ancient humans that occupied southeast Asia, among other areas—in 33 populations in the regions studied.
“The major challenge was analytical, coming up with a method that could detect even small amounts of Denisovan genetic material,” said Max Planck Institute evolutionary professor Mark Stoneking, one of the lead authors of the study.
Denisovan genetic material was identified in populations in southeast Asia and Oceania—including the Australian aborigine, New Guinean, and the Philippine Negrito—suggesting ancestral interbreeding with Denisovans that did not occur in populations found further west and northwest, such as the Asian mainland.
HMS Professor David E. Reich, the other lead author, argued that these results fit the patterns of multiple migration waves, rather than one single wave.
“This leads to two implications,” he said. “First, Denisovans interbred with the population very early in southeast Asia ... Second, there had to be two waves of migration in southeast Asia.”
The initial wave led to the ancestors of the human populations with traces of the Denisovan genome in southeast Asia and Oceania.
Other subsequent waves of humans—likely ancestors of modern-day Chinese and Indonesian populations—later displaced the existing occupants of East Asia and Southeast Asia, including some of the Denisovan-human groups, according to Reich.
The sequencing of the Denisovan genome—an essential precursor to the present study—was carried out last year by another group at the Max Planck Institute from a fossilized finger tip bone found in the Denisova Cave in Siberia. The scientists found that Denisovans were descended from similar ancestors as early humans and Neanderthals.

By pairing engineering students with doctors at Harvard-affiliated hospitals, a new course titled Engineering Sciences 227: Medical Device Design bridges the divide between engineering and medicine.
The class, which was offered for the first time last spring, is the brainchild of SEAS Lecturer Conor J. Walsh, who said he was inspired by a similar class taught by his MIT graduate advisor.
When he arrived at Harvard last year, Walsh noticed a need for hands-on, project-based learning at SEAS.
He said the goal of his course is to bring together students of engineering and doctors to solve practical medical problems together. This past term, Walsh’s 15 students split into different groups to tackle four difficult medical problems proposed by practicing doctors. He said one of the exciting aspects of the class is that the project ideas are generated by doctors, but the students themselves pick which projects to work on.
“We bring in a number of different doctors, but it’s really the students who decide what they want to work on,” said Walsh.
According to Samuel B. Kesner, a graduate student in engineering and the teaching fellow for ES 227, the course focused on the interdisciplinary nature of medical device design from the beginning. In addition to Walsh’s lessons, the course consisted of guest lectures by members of the Harvard Business School and the Harvard Law School. Teammates also met regularly to work on their individual projects, and while there was no homework per se, the teams were required to submit assignments related to their projects on a weekly basis.
The hands-on nature of the class differs sharply from most of Harvard’s course offerings, Kesner said. While Harvard is very strong in the theoretical sciences and growing stronger in the applied sciences, Kesner said that there are relatively few graduate engineering classes that offer the type of interdisciplinary, interactive, project-based work that ES 227 champions.
“Students get the most out of it by really getting immersed in the material, and there’s no better way than actually working on a project,” Kesner said.
Both Walsh and Kesner were pleased by the outcome of the course’s first semester, and hope to offer it again as long as they can secure funding. Walsh envisions the course slowly becoming even more interdisciplinary, bringing on students from the HBS and HLS to join the project teams in the hopes of successfully taking products from the design stage to production stage.
“Everyone involved had a great time—the doctors were pleased and the students enthusiastic and excited,” said Kesner. “We’d love to offer it again.”

Eva Gillis-Buck ’12, a joint concentrator in Women, Gender, and Sexuality and Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology, has spent a great deal of her undergraduate career unpacking the gender paradigms that pervade autism and neuroscience research.
But whenever her studies of gender biases start to seem discouraging, Gillis-Buck says she looks to the inspiring women that work alongside her in her stem cell lab.
“They do not fulfill the stereotype of the geeky scientist alone in the corner,” she says. “They’re super smart but also very well-rounded, very fun, very silly.”
Understanding the importance of these types of role models inspired Gillis-Buck and Meredith A. MacGregor ’11 to launch the Harvard Science Club for Girls this past spring. The program sends Harvard women and other female scientists into schools each week to mentor young girls and foster enthusiasm about science.
“We’re not just there to convey information, but to show them that science can be fun,” Gillis-Buck says. “That you can be a scientist and have lots of interests and not look like Einstein.”
Harvard Science Club for Girls joins a growing contingent of campus organizations that support women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
Among these groups are a new women’s science magazine called Women Innovating Science and Engineering (WISE) Words, WISHR (Women in Science at Harvard-Radcliffe) and WISTEM (a mentoring program for females in STEM fields run by the Women’s Center).
“The number of women who graduate with STEM degrees and continue on to the next phase shrinks at every step,” notes Women’s Center Director Gina Helfrich. “I largely understand groups for women in science to be a place that creates a sense of community and belonging for its members. Through that network of support, they help to keep women in the STEM pipeline.”
THE ‘WHOLE GIRL’
As Gillis-Buck explores the “pervasive and problematic theory” of “autism as the extreme male brain” for her thesis, she says she is excited about unpacking the consequences of doing neurobiological research under a gendered paradigm.
Her thesis touches on the distinction between what her advisor, History of Science and WGS Assistant Professor Sarah S. Richardson, calls the topic of “gender and science” and the topic of “women in science.”
The former, Richardson explains, deals with the way gender conceptions influence the content and practice of science. Meanwhile, issues of “women in science” deal with attracting women to STEM fields and with women’s status in these professions.
Richardson—who also serves as the faculty advisor for the Harvard Science Club for Girls—says she sees these issues as intrinsically linked.
“If a field of scientific research is systematically in its knowledge excluding women, as medicine once did, if it is perpetuating theories that are sexist or misogynist or in some way sex-biased, I would suggest that this may contribute to the hostility of that field towards women entering it,” she says.
Breaking stereotypes is one of the Harvard Science Club for Girls’ main missions. From anatomy to crystals to circuits, the Club’s lessons are meant to be diverse and engaging—but Gillis-Buck says the program is mainly about fostering “the whole girl” and demonstrating that “science is for everyone.”
The Club also provides a positive community for its older members, according to Gillis-Buck and Richardson.
“[Engaging with the young girls] puts them at the front lines of that work and will make them, as they move up the ranks, very sensitive ... leaders in the effort to draw women and girls into science,” Richardson says.
THE MERITS OF MENTORS
When WISHR Co-President Jennifer K. Cloutier ’13 returned home this past summer, she says she was shocked to find her favorite physics teacher instructing an all-male class.
“He asked me to come back sometime this year and talk about science, tell the girls not to be scared of it,” she says, noting that the episode re-energized her WISHR plans for the year.
One aim of both WISHR and WISE Words Magazine, founded this spring by Julia C. Tartaglia ’11 and her sister Christina E. Tartaglia ’09, is to increase the visibility of women already in science.
“Most people can’t name one female scientist, and we really want to change that,” Christina Tartaglia says.
Women’s Leadership Conference organizer Rachel M. Neiger ’12 also emphasized the struggle to attain and navigate female science networks.
“It’s sometimes hard for women to advance in science because there isn’t that network of female advisors, so it’s harder to get appointments and grants,” she says.
Leslie A. Rea ’12, who organized the first “Women in Science” panel in the WLC’s 24-year history, helped recruit School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Cherry A. Murray to speak about how she became a leader in science and about the importance of mentoring.
Rea says her personal mentor has been Sujata K. Bhatia, who joined SEAS in May as the assistant director of undergraduate studies for Biomedical Engineering.
Bhatia says that many of the students she encounters worry about work-life balance and whether or not they have what it takes to succeed in engineering. Bhatia encourages women to speak up in class, so they can “learn that they have a unique voice to contribute to the field.”
WISHR Co-President Swara S. Kopparty ’12, an Applied Math concentrator notes that in the future she hopes WISHR’s bi-annual National Symposium for the Advancement of Women in Science will include speakers in fields like economics and computer science as well as hard sciences.
WIDENING THEIR IMPACT
When WISE Words won the i3 Competition in the spring of 2011, the organization received funding its founders hope will allow the publication to have a national impact.
“We think that our online presence allows us to have really wide-spread effects, so our audience can be nation-wide,” Julia says. “People might not have time to go to an event or a conference ... but everybody has time to check their computer.”
Professor Melissa Franklin, who was named the first female chair of the Harvard Physics Department in 2010, says that though the department’s female population has risen in recent years, there are still inherent obstacles in the system.
“It’s hard to be a minority,” Franklin says. “I used to think it had a lot to do with confidence. If girls had confidence, they would just learn physics, no matter what anybody else thought.”
Susanne F. Yelin, a senior research fellow in the physics department, said she feels that “on average, women doubt themselves much more than men,” and that “one always feels like the odd one out at meetings where everyone else is male.”
For these reasons, she believes a publication like WISE Words that promotes the visibility of women in science is invaluable.
Whether facilitating mentorship relationships, challenging stereotypes, or providing role models, these clubs have in common a desire to make evident the potential for rewarding and engaging scientific careers for women.
Richardson notes that once women break into certain fields, they ask different types of questions, thereby generating new knowledge and transforming the discipline in exciting ways.
“If a woman is willing to stick with a career in science or engineering, she has a really bright future,” Bhatia says.
“With the girls in my class, I tell them: ‘you belong here.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WOBURN, Mass.—Former Harvard student Brittany J. Smith pleaded guilty Friday to five of six counts related to her role in the May 2009 killing of a Cambridge drug dealer in Kirkland House. She was promptly sentenced to three years in prison, in addition to two years of probation.
After a two-year legal drama, Friday’s sentencing marks the fourth and last individual to be convicted in connection with the 2009 shooting that resulted in the death of Cambridge resident Justin Cosby, 21. The ruling follows the felony murder conviction of her boyfriend at the time of the shooting, Jabrai Jordan Copney. Smith was convicted of hiding the murder weapon her boyfriend handed her after the shooting and of then lying to investigators about her involvement.
Smith pleaded guilty Friday to accessory after the fact to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, accessory after the fact to unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of a firearm, and willfully misleading the police. Smith also pleaded guilty to the charge of willfully misleading the grand jury. Under the terms, Smith acknowledged repeatedly lying to a grand jury but maintains that in several instances she did, in fact, not lie.
In the charge of accessory after the fact to murder, Smith maintained her not guilty plea.
Smith's sentence does not grant her the possibility of parole, and while she is on probation she must seek to maintain employment or attend school.
"By pleading guilty today, Brittany Smith is taking responsibility for her role in the events leading up to, and directly following, the senseless murder of a beloved young man," Middlesex County District Attorney Gerard T. Leone '85 said in a statement.
Smith, the only Harvard affiliate charged in Cosby’s murder, stood in court on Friday with her attorney John P. Osler. Her father and more than 10 family members and friends looked on.
"Your nonchalant and cavalier attitude makes me sick," the victim’s mother, Denise Cosby, said in court. "You were the nucleus of this catastrophe."
Denise Cosby was joined by several members of the victim’s extended family, including Cosby's uncle, who also spoke out in court. Gregory Cosby said that Cosby was "amazing with children" and frequently volunteered and worked with children prior to his death.
"They loved him, and he also loved them," Gregory Cosby said, reading from a statement. "What gave you and your boyfriend the right to plan his murder? I never met you, but words cannot express my anger toward you."
Cosby was studying at Salem State College the semester prior to his death, Denise Cosby said in an interview after Friday's court proceedings. He had just withdrawn for the semester and was planning to return to school that fall, she said.
Denise Cosby said that her son aspired to be a physical education teacher because he thought that the subject would be fun for the kids.
"I couldn't believe as my son passed away right in front of my eyes," she said in court, addressing Smith. "In my opinion, you are just as responsible for my son's death as the shooter."
Friday's hearing came at the conclusion of sentencing negotiations between the prosecution and defense, which had been ongoing since June when Superior Court Justice Diane M. Kottmyer denied the defense's motion to dismiss the charges.
While the defense recommended a sentence of two and a half years, the prosecution asked that Smith be sentenced to five to seven. At three years in prison, the ruling handed down by Superior Court Justice Kathe M. Tuttman splits the difference between the two sentencing recommendations.
Smith’s attorney, Osler, declined to comment on the sentence.
On May 18, 2009, just two weeks before Smith's graduation from Harvard, her boyfriend Copney and two accomplices shot and killed Cosby in the basement of Kirkland’s J entryway.
An aspiring songwriter from New York City who frequently visited Smith and stayed in her room, Copney was convicted of felony murder of the first degree at the conclusion of his trial in April. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
His accomplices Blayn Jiggetts and Jason F. Aquino pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter prior to the start of Copney’s trial in exchange for cooperating with the case against Copney. Aquino was sentenced to 18 to 20 years in prison. A sentencing date has not yet been set for Jiggetts.
A senior in Lowell House at the time, Smith watched Jiggetts load the gun in her room before the men brought Cosby to Kirkland House to arrange the drug rip. Smith gave Copney and his accomplices her Harvard ID to gain access to the Kirkland basement, where Cosby was shot. Cosby later died from a bullet wound to his abdomen.
Upon Copney’s return from Cosby's shooting, Smith hid the gun in her blockmate’s room in a bag under her bed. She then called a taxi to help with the men’s getaway to South Station, where the four boarded a bus to New York. Smith returned to Harvard the next day.
Smith entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the district attorney's office in July 2009, but prosecutors said she later lied to investigators and misled a grand jury, breaking the terms of the agreement. Smith's lawyer disputed that claim and tried to dismiss the case. Kottmeyer denied the defense's motion in June, which resulted in the two sides entering into negotiations for a plea agreement.
Chanequa N. Campbell, another former Harvard student, has also been implicated in the murder and was denied a diploma in 2009, but Smith is the only Harvard student charged for involvement in the murder. Campbell has maintained a non-prosecution agreement with the district attorney's office and has been cooperating in the investigations against the other defendants.

Harvard football alum, Eric LaHaie ’02, has headed to the Sahara  Desert to race in honor of his late teammate and friend, Niall Murphy ’02.
LaHaie and Murphy were best friends and both All-Ivy defenders for the Crimson.
Murphy, who was also a hurdler on the track and field team, suffered from diabetes at a young age and passed away suddenly in February due to complications from juvenile diabetes.
Just 31 years old when he died, Murphy was remembered for not only being an exceptional athlete, but one with a helpful, energetic, and fun-loving attitude.
“Niall was my teammate, my wingman, and my best friend,” wrote LaHaie in a hepstrack article. “I have never met a more genuine and free spirited guy in my life. We were two peas in a pod, and I miss him dearly, as do all his friends and family. But his memory and legacy with always live on in our hearts and minds.”
Eric LaHaie is now a well-known endurance runner who has won races through some of the most treacherous domains, such as China's Taklamakan Desert in China and the Gobi Desert.
LaHaie’s next endeavor takes him to The Sahara Race 2011, where he will compete in honor of Niall and to raise money and awareness for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.
“Niall was loved and cherished by us all, and I will be thinking about him a lot out in the desert and I know he will be there with me every step of the way,” writes LaHaie in his blog.
This seven-day trek, starting October 2nd, is named by TIME magazine as one of the Top 10 Endurance Competitions in the world. The race is a self-supported 250 km (155 miles) run over largely sandy terrain. The Sahara is the hottest desert in the world, and temperatures there can reach up to 122 degrees.
Nearly $13,000 has already been raised in Niall’s name for the campaign. You can go here to donate.
LaHaie’s has chronicled his rigorous training process on his blog, ending every post by saying:  “Run with your heart, not your feet. This is how Niall ran and lived.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Harvard football’s first home game of the season, freshman defensive end Zach Hodges wreaked havoc on Brown’s offense, earning the Ivy League Rookie of the Week accolade for his efforts.
Playing like a seasoned veteran, the freshman tallied three tackles, led his team with three quarterback hurries, and had a game changing forced fumble on the Harvard one-yard line.
For Hodges, this success has been a long time coming.
Because sometimes, the stats don’t tell the full story.
When Hodges was six, his father passed away. He and his mother moved from place to place, at times even battling bouts of homelessness.
During the fall of his junior year, to make matters worse, Hodges’ mother suffered a massive, fatal stroke. After her death, Hodges moved from his hometown of Charlottesville, NC, effectively “drop[ping] everything” in his life to move to Atlanta.
The move—which came in the middle of his junior year in high school—was challenging for Hodges, who naturally found difficulty in understanding the hardships he faced and was unsure of his future.
“He has faced more adversity than 98 percent of the students at Harvard,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said.
Through it all, Hodges’ unshakable faith has proven to be a main constant in his life and is a force that has enabled him to overcome personal hardship.
In the sixth grade, when Hodges was facing various difficulties, he turned to Christianity to help guide him and deal with his experiences.
“I am a pretty religious person, and my personal relationship with Christ is probably the biggest thing,” Hodges said. “I know that God has a purpose ... I don’t know what is best, so I need to sit back and trust God.”
Hodges’ faith ultimately allowed him to settle down and have a good junior year of football.
Though the 6’3, 220-pound freshman began his football career at what he considered the “late” age of nine and called himself an “okay” player who simply enjoyed the game, his high school stats speak for themselves.
In nine games during his senior year, he earned 21 sacks and forced 10 fumbles.
His stellar play in high school made him a hot commodity to college coaches, and over 25 schools recruited him. Ultimately, it was the strong academic environment that influenced Hodges to choose Harvard.
“I like the fact that Harvard puts academics first,” Hodges said. “It gave me a chance to see that there is more to life than football.”
For people from his hometown, it might not be too surprising that Hodges ended up at Harvard.
“Everyone back home knew me [as] more of a student than [a] football player,” Hodges said.
But first, after graduating from high school in 2010, Hodges spent the past year at the Philips Exeter Academy, where he took a postgraduate year, which proved to be a valuable time for personal and physical maturity.
“It was a great decision [to take a post graduate year],” Murphy said. “It was a smart decision ... he even looks back now and says it was time well spent.”
Now, three years after the recruitment began, Harvard football coach Tim Murphy is reaping the benefits of snagging Hodges.
“[Hodges] came in as a freshman this year and did not act like a freshman,” Murphy said. “He ticked off a lot of the upperclassmen during preseason, and that’s a good thing ... it means that he is flying around and playing with intensity.”
Hodges spent this summer training with his Crimson teammates, which entailed 5 a.m. wake-ups and intense physical preparation. He understands that as a freshman on the starting lineup—a rarity for Harvard football—he must work exceptionally hard to prove his worth.
“I am one of the younger guys that is getting play time, so I just want to make sure that I give my teammates everything I can give them,” Hodges said.
Hodges is not just getting playing time; he has excelled on the field and is quickly a mainstay of the defensive line.
But after overcoming immense amounts of personal adversity, Hodges understands the profound opportunity of playing football for Harvard and will not take it lightly.
“He does not take anything for granted here at Harvard,” Murphy said. He appreciates the opportunity he has ... This is a kid that is going to make the most of his opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team (2-5-1) will look to start its season off with a fresh slate as it opens Ivy League play this Saturday with a game against rival Yale (4-4-1) at Reese Stadium. Much is at stake in the Crimson’s remaining games, with in-conference victories being the only thing that matters when it comes to determining who gets the Ancient Eight’s automatic berth in the NCAA tournament.
“Being the first Ivy League game, it’s obviously going to be a difficult one,” co-captain Tim Linden said. “Something about the Ivy League, every game is a battle. There’s no tournament like there is for other conferences. The results during league play really determine the winner of the league. It comes down to which team has the will to win and who doesn’t want to step off the field with a loss. We’re focusing on our mental toughness and team cohesiveness.”
Harvard is coming off Wednesday night’s 2-1 home loss to Boston University, in which the coaching staff experimented with the lineup in order to give the veterans a rest and the rookies a chance to showcase their talent. In that contest, the Crimson got on the scoreboard first thanks to a header in the 29th minute from junior Zack Wolfenzon, but then watched as the Terriers took a 2-1 lead midway through the second half. Despite a spirited comeback bid, Harvard could not muster up enough second-half offense to even the score against their cross-town rivals.
“Obviously we saw a lot of things that we can improve upon, but we also saw a lot of things that went really well for us against BU, especially in the first half,” Linden said. “A lot of different guys saw time against BU, and a lot of players had the opportunity to prove themselves. The coaches had time to see who was effective. Going forward … we’re going to make sure our most effective players are out there and make sure they’re strong.”
Prior to Wednesday’s game, the Crimson had capped off a two-game road trip last weekend on the West Coast that saw Harvard fall to Stanford, 1-0, in the Nike Classic and play to a 0-0 tie against Santa Clara two days later.
The Bulldogs enter Saturday night’s contest coming off a 1-0 loss to No. 1 Connecticut in double-overtime on Tuesday. It nearly pulled off an upset that would have sent a powerful message to the other teams in the Ivy League that Yale is no longer a cellar dweller in the conference’s standings.
“In the past two years, Yale has been one of the bottom teams in the Ivy League,” junior co-captain Scott Prozeller said. “Despite that, it’s always an incredibly tough game for us … It’s going to be a 90-minute battle.”
The Crimson will have to contend with a formidable Bulldogs offense that has scored four times as many goals as Harvard has on the year. Fifth-year senior Brad Rose, who is tied for 13th in the country in assists per game, leads the charge for the Bulldogs. Sophomores Jenner Fox, with nine total points, and Peter Jacobsen, who has put away four goals, are also coming up big on the offensive side of the field for Yale.
“We’ll probably control possession a lot of the game,” Linden said when asked how his team would deal with the Bulldogs’ attack. “These next couple days of practice we’re going to get together as a team and work on our offensive strategy. We’re much more concerned about ourselves and how we’re going to put the ball in the back of the net [than with the Yale offense].”
The Crimson has scored just four goals all year and has been outscored by opponents, 8-4. The Crimson will look to juniors Brian Rogers and Prozeller for their offensive production. Rogers leads the team in goals scored, having found the back of the net in a season-opening win against Northeastern and a 2-1 loss to Rhode Island. Prozeller secured a thrilling 1-0 victory over Massachusetts on September 16th when he converted on a penalty kick five minutes into overtime.
“The main thing we’ve struggled with this year is goals,” Prozeller said. “One of the most important things against Yale is going to be scoring early. If we do that, we’ll open things up and make them attack us.”
Last year’s Harvard-Yale matchup at Ohiri Field ended in a 1-0 win for the Crimson, with Prozeller finding the back of the net in the 30th minute to record the game’s only score. That was the 15th career shutout for senior goalkeeper Austin Harms. In Saturday’s contest, Harms will look to tie the school record of 19 shutouts held by Chris Johnson ’06.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday was Rosh Hashanah. And we all know what that means—Ivy League football is starting to heat up.
Well, that’s not entirely true. But as it so happens, this year, the start of 5772 coincides with some of the first meaningful games of the Ancient Eight season.
It’s also an especially appropriate metaphor this year in that we can compare some of Bubbe’s favorite dishes to the teams in the league.
Harvard, for one, has had mixed performances so far this year. Against Holy Cross in the season opener, the Crimson was horseradish—it was the type of game that would make a fan tear up. Play was inconsistent, and you definitely left with a worst taste in your mouth than when you started.
But last week against Brown, Harvard was apples and honey, Rosh Hashanah’s dish of choice. What’s great about the snack is that it takes two independently delicious items—the apples and the honey—and fuses them into one sticky slice of greatness.
Likewise, the Crimson put it all together last week. The secondary picked up its play a week ago after a sloppy opener. And even without senior quarterback Collier Winters, junior backup Colton Chapple filled the void, throwing for two touchdowns in the Crimson’s first win.
At the moment, Penn is the gefilte fish of the Ivy League. The preseason Ivy League favorites, the Quakers have been handled by their first two opponents, Lafayette and Villanova. Like the gefilte fish, you know that something is good about Penn—I mean, so many people love it, right?—but you just haven’t figured out what exactly that is yet.
Yale is Ancient Eight’s blintz. When it comes down to it, a blintz is all about what’s inside. Sure, it might look good, but you can’t really know until you take a bite. The Bulldogs have played well so far, but we haven’t seen them play any tough games yet. What’ll happen when they get to the meat of the schedule?
Now imagine that I got some challah and forgot to throw it away before I left the house for a three-week trip. That’s how I see Princeton.
Let’s get onto the picks.
YALE (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) at LEHIGH (3-1, 0-0 Patriot)
Amazingly, just two weeks into the Ivy League season, Yale is the only unbeaten team left. Its offense has been prodigious, scoring 37 points in each of its first two games.
Bulldogs quarterback Patrick Witt has completed almost 75 percent of his passes this year and has thrown for five touchdowns and just one pick. And Yale’s run game has averaged 139 rushing yards per game to add to its five scores so far this year.
But Lehigh may be its toughest game yet. The Mountain Hawks have won three of their first four (well, two-and-a-half if you account for a win against Princeton), and its only loss came in a 48-41 overtime shootout against New Hampshire.
Expect big numbers from two teams that haven’t scored fewer than 27 points this year. I’ll give the edge to the home team.
Pick: Lehigh 41, Yale 35
WAGNER (1-3, 1-2 NORTHEAST) at CORNELL (1-1, 0-1 Ivy)
Cornell lost to Yale last week. But with the Bulldogs emerging as a serious league contender and with the win over Bucknell in week one, there’s a chance that Cornell may be an improved team from last season.
Wagner has lost its last three, but both games have been tight. But I also think that the calibers of teams the Seahawks have played so far haven’t been great, with the exception of one FCS-ranked team.
Pick: Cornell 16, Wagner 13
PENN (0-2, 0-0 Ivy) at DARTMOUTH (1-1, 0-0 Ivy)
Penn’s level of play so far this year has to be the biggest surprise in the league. It’s not just that the Quakers have lost its first two games. It’s that they were defeated badly in both.
Meanwhile, Dartmouth returns last year’s co-MVP Nick Schwieger, and the running back is out to another tremendous start to the year. He’s averaging 137.5 yards per game.The Big Green’s first loss, last week against Sacred Heart, came down to a last-minute field goal. The team could just as easily be 2-0.
that I would have even been considering Dartmouth in this game, I would’ve laughed. But the Quakers have been playing sub-par football; the Big Green has impressed in the season’s first two weeks.
Plus, it’s Dartmouth’s first ever night game. Home-field advantage will be as strong as ever.
Pick: Dartmouth 24, Penn 21
RHODE ISLAND (1-2, 0-1Atlantic 10) at BROWN (1-1, 0-1)
Though Harvard played well last week, I also think Brown just had a lousy game.
Quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero remains one of the top passers in the league and should not be overlooked as a threat.
Rhode Island picked up its first win last week against Fordham, which only beat Columbia by a touchdown. It’s tough for me to count that win as too meaningful.
Pick: Brown 28, Rhode Island 20
COLUMBIA (0-2, 0-0 Ivy) at PRINCETON (0-2, 0-0)
I half-expected both of these teams to remain winless for a larger chunk of the year, but I guess if they’re playing each other that’s no longer possible.
Both teams are coming off blowout losses last week, so this matchup might actually allow them, as they say, to pick on someone their own size. Columbia certainly isn’t the class of the Ivy League, but at least it kept its first game close.
Pick:  Columbia 17, Princeton 10
HARVARD (1-1, 1-0 Ivy) at LAFAYETTE (1-3, 0-1 Patriot)
Sports confuse me sometimes.
Lafayette crushed the only team favored over Harvard in the Ivies, yet lost to the team that Brown beat? It’s confusing.
There’s really no way to anticipate what’s going to happen in this one.
It’s unclear whether Winters or Chapple will start for the Crimson, but my money’s on Chapple.
There are a lot of question marks going into this game, probably more than in any other on the Ivy schedule.
Pick: Harvard 31, Lafayette 27

Once again, Tyra Banks has given us the final word on the ups and downs of life at Harvard. The model/media personality/businesswoman/author recently revealed one of the university’s best-kept secrets to the world—it's actually supposed to be hard.
At a signing for her book "Modelland" on Tuesday, Banks told her audience about the realities of academic life at Harvard, where she is currently attending a management program at the Business School.
"I think they make it hard on purpose. Once you get done reading one assignment, you get another," Banks said.
Yep, that's pretty much how it works.
