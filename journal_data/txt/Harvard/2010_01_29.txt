After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake in Haiti has left more than 150,000 dead as heroic individuals work tirelessly to contain the damage and rebuild the struggling nation. Already one of the poorest countries in the world before the natural disaster, Haiti will need aid not only immediately but also years down the road as it reconstructs its infrastructure, recollects its government, and revamps its economy. This extended recovery mission will require a team committed for the long haul as well as a multilateral approach that spreads responsibility amongst all members of the world community. For these reasons, the United Nations is the organization best suited to coordinate relief efforts and rebuild the Haitian state.
The U.N.’s doctrine of Responsibility to Protect makes it the appropriate body to spearhead this endeavor. Adopted in 2001, this policy calls on all nations to provide for their collective security through shared responsibility of world crises. The tragedy in Haiti unmistakably qualifies as a crisis. With this in mind, the U.N. is the proper agent to organize necessary supplies and services in the short term and sustain the Haitian government in the long term, since it can best facilitate the cross-national efforts required under the Responsibility to Protect.
The appeal of a U.N. led rescue and recovery mission lies in its implication of multilateralism and political neutrality. As an association of nations, the U.N. must lead a global response to a severe disaster. All member nations would contribute to the U.N. relief effort, creating multilateral engagement that will foster a much greater sense of respect and credibility than any unilateral response could generate. A unilateral mission could be looked upon with suspicion. The U.N. is a politically neutral body without any personal, economic, or political ambitions, making its involvement the most palatable to all nations.
However, our stance on the future of the operation in no way denounces the American response. In fact, we commend our fellow citizens for their swift and passionate contributions to Haiti. Nearly half of all Americans have donated to the rescue mission—certainly a laudable achievement. Our government also deserves recognition for its coordination of multifaceted relief efforts. Without a doubt, the U.S. has rendered Haiti and the world, a great service with its outpouring of aid.
Although the U.N. should soon take the reigns of the relief mission, it can only accomplish its goals in Haiti if member nations continue providing their unwavering support in the form of money, supplies, and labor. The U.N. is as effective as the sum of its parts, its resolve only as robust as the commitment of its members. While the U.N. should be in charge of coordinating the resources and services, its success depends on the continued contributions of the international community.
Those in charge of planning the recovery in Haiti must recognize the abject poverty and suffering that existed there even before the quake. In order to succeed, the U.N. must nudge the Haitian economy in the right direction by reforesting the environment and rebuilding destroyed infrastructure.
In the past century, Haiti has transformed its ecological landscape by felling trees for charcoal. This practice has eroded the topsoil in many regions, making agriculture difficult for farmers and forcing them to overcrowd the cities, which then leads to crime and poverty. For long-term success, Haiti must transition to sustainable agriculture, which would help the economy as well as the environment.
As an underdeveloped nation, Haiti was especially vulnerable to a disaster of this magnitude. Once the rubble clears, relief groups must focus on modernizing the country’s decrepit infrastructure. The Army Corps of Engineers has specified that any recovery in Haiti must renovate the ports, airfields, electrical grids, and water and road systems. It is not enough to merely restore Haiti to its former condition; true relief means leaving the country with the means to provide essential services to its own people.
The devastation in Haiti has been a real human tragedy. However, the tremendous outpouring of support suggests that there is reason for optimism. When the dust clears, we hope that the U.N. and its constituent nations act efficiently and deliberately to build a stronger and more resilient Haiti.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Times are tough at Harvard. Our huge endowment is now a less huge endowment. Young liberals campus-wide are still sobbing into their cappuccinos over Scott Brown’s victory.  Childhood dreams about working at Goldman Sachs have been crushed, and the prospect of sub-six-figure salaries is becoming a horrifying reality.
But even before these bleak times, Harvard was party to a gross injustice. Even at the height of its glory, it harbored a nasty deficiency that threatened and continues to threaten the quality of student life. I am referring, of course, to the quality of our toilet paper.
The toilet paper at Harvard does not offer the gentle and comforting caress that is to be expected at a university of international renown. Indeed, the toilet paper provided is inexcusably average, and of no comfort to the pale and pampered tush of the average Harvard student. Many minutes of study time have been wasted by this glorified tissue paper and its frustrating inability to properly attend to even the lightest of Au Bon Pain and frappacino-infused pâtés, let alone a heavy-duty Rubinoff and Noch’s combo.
This outrageous inconvenience is only compounded by the Stalinesque two-roll-per-visit quotas on toilet paper acquisitions.
This draconian rationing of toilet paper reveals itself as such when an urgent undergraduate, gorged on squash and Our Dear Leader’s weekly gift of hot sausage and eggs, finds himself perched on a porcelain potty. Smug because of a particularly generous offering to the Charles River, his hand reaches for his janitorial set only to find unwelcoming and coarse texture of a cardboard tube. Panic and rage set in.
Two toilet rolls is perfectly reasonable if they are of suitable quality, possessing both the tensile strength to accommodate a particularly involved cleaning and the softness necessary to accommodate the delicate extremities of a budding academic. But this ration is utter madness when the toilet paper in question is the quality of a Great Depression-era phone book page. What could have been accomplished in two swift wipes now requires twice the effort and demands thrice the material.
According to my conservative estimates toilet paper-less defecation occurs at a rate of at least 40.5 freshman tushies and 23 upperclassmen tushies a day. Comfort and peace of mind demand that we take action. The first step that must be taken is to provide a brand of toilet paper that is both comfortable enough to accommodate the discerning buttocks and durable enough to prevent messy private failure. Quality toilet paper can be consumed like caviar—in smaller amounts than fast food but with greater amounts of utility.
Indeed, this idea should even appeal to more conservative bathroom-goers who might assume that higher quality toilet paper is an unnecessary expense. With better toilet paper, we can accomplish with a single transcendent wipe what would have required multiple unsatisfying squares and save a considerable amount of money. The bathroom tissue we currently employ, Georgia Pacific’s “Preference”, is available at 76¢ per roll and Charmin’s “Ultra Soft”, a bathroom tissue befitting a patrician, is a reasonable 83¢ per roll. That extra seven cents is an investment in the comfort of the next Emerson, and will allow us to once again raise aloft a standard of obscene luxury that Yale and peer institutions will again struggle to match.
No matter what we do about this crisis, it seems clear that something must be done. Put yourself in the place of the deprived defecator stuck on a toilet with choice between public embarrassment and private filthiness. How would you resolve such an impossible dilemma?

During the “Opening Days” this fall, Harvard’s freshmen orientation week, the Institute of Politics debate over healthcare turned into a lot of mudslinging and grandiose accusations over death panels and government-run healthcare. It’s a shame that we choose to focus on these side issues when a major part of the problem is the fact that 28 percent of people in the 18-24 age group are uninsured, the highest of any group. There needs to be a voice telling students that the current healthcare bill in Congress will have a direct effect on our lives from the day we graduate until retirement. The healthcare system that has been handed down since World War II is certainly broken in many ways, but the current “reform” plans need to be fully examined for their impact on the younger generations.
The central component of the bill is the individual mandate on everyone to buy healthcare insurance. This poses an immediate and steep cost for young people who do not have access to steady income or employer benefits. Harvard’s Student Health Plan, which is required for all students, even those with family health plans, was a product of the current Massachusetts healthcare bill that includes a personal mandate,. Students now incur a minimum of an additional $1000 per year cost added on the term bill, and roughly triple that for those who subscribe to Harvard’s Blue Cross Blue Shield plan. Compared to other groups, like seniors, who are covered by Medicare, and working adults, who might have generous employee health plans, students would be hit hard by the mandate.
The solution from politicians in Washington has been to allow people to be covered by their parents’ insurance until age 26. While this proposal would reduce some the impact of the mandate on the youngest age groups because they tend to be the healthiest and the least prone to high-cost diseases, it is not the cure-all for healthcare that some politicians have claimed it to be. The proposal may actually make sense in the current economic climate—the employment rate for people aged 16-24 has fallen to a low of 51.4 percent. But this number has been falling consistently since its peak in 1989, which suggests that other factors may be influencing its decline, and it is not much different from the total employment rate of 59 percent.
Thus, the extension of healthcare to younger workers, thus, does not do enough to offset the rising costs incurred by young people due to other provisions in the bill. Additionally, the healthcare plan prevents the young from capitalizing on their good health. Factors, including limiting the amount that companies can charge older patients, preventing the denial of coverage based on preexisting conditions, and “community rating”—or price controls—to limit the ability to offer lower costs to lower risk patients, would likely mean that younger workers would have to pay more for their basic healthcare coverage, despite being healthier.
The mandate system would also be unlikely to reduce costs in the healthcare bureaucracy. In fact, the mandate has been shown to sharply increase the number of payers in the system, which artificially drives up demand and prices, as seen by the rising individual costs of Massachusetts healthcare under the state’s current universal plan. Since that reform passed, health insurers have raised premiums between 7-12 percent, greater than the national average of 5-7 percent increases. This makes Massachusetts the state with the highest average family healthcare plans, $13,788 per year, despite the carefully crafted reform bill. Thus, the price control provisions in the healthcare bill should only lead to expectations of greater increases for younger workers.
Another component of the healthcare bill that is potentially devastating to our generation is the burden it places on small businesses. When one thinks of small businesses, one tends to think of mom and pop stores, family operations, and life savings. Yet a recent Kauffman Foundation report indicated that there is a “coming entrepreneurship boom” among people ages 20-34. The Democrats’ healthcare plan would require all small businesses with payrolls over $400,000—around one million employers—to cover healthcare or pay an 8 percent surcharge. This means that the added bureaucracy and taxes of the current healthcare bill will stymie future innovation.
The mandate will strip those who do not feel that they need complete coverage or coverage at the level determined by the government of their rights. Unfortunately, that categorization almost exclusively defines young adults. Policies ranging from community rating to increased equality in healthcare plans will only increase premiums and threaten jobs, while new taxes will disincentivize small business growth. Students should therefore pay greater attention to the reforms being discussed in Washington—for they will directly impact their lives and potentially map out their futures.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It might be easy to forget that just over a week ago, Haiti experienced its largest earthquake in 200 years, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths, hundreds of thousands of injuries and infections, and unthinkable devastation in the capital of Port-au-Prince. The media has already begun to turn its focus to other issues, but we must not forget about Haiti so soon—not again.
For too long, Haitians have been neglected by their northern neighbors and forgotten by the constituencies on whose behalf wealthier governments claim to act. After being established by former slaves and revolting against its French master in 1804, Haiti was not welcomed into the international community of independent nations. The United States, viewing a nation of former slaves as a threat to slavery in the Western hemisphere, refused to grant diplomatic recognition to Haiti until 1862. The French demanded that Haiti pay an unreasonable price for the new nation to receive diplomatic recognition—150 million gold francs to French citizens who lost property and assets during the Haitian Revolution. Needless to say, repaying a debt representing five times Haiti’s export revenue for 1825 drained the government’s coffers, crippling the capacity of the Haitian state to support its large peasant population. Since then, Haiti’s history has been marked by the exploitative economic presence of wealthy northern countries, foreign intervention in internal politics, the establishment of the modern Haitian army by the United States, and Cold War support for brutal dictators whose legacies are still felt.
Before the earthquake, Haiti was the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere. Over the past two weeks, it is now clear Haiti has lost almost everything, from its already fragile infrastructure to its lifeline of international aid. While no accurate death toll figure exists yet, The Haitian government has said that 150,000 have died in the capital of Port-au-Prince alone. The capital lies in ruins, and the surviving population hangs by a thread in tent towns now housing millions of homeless Haitians.
As students, we read about this tragedy with an intellectual curiosity and a shared belief that these events are tragic and something must be done. Unfortunately, we stop there. We find ourselves following the tragedy in the news, speaking about it with our friends, agreeing something must be done, and then going about our daily business. After all, we haven’t figured out our classes yet, and that’s important, right?
We simply cannot allow our devotion to this cause slip away as it turns from a current event to a past tragedy. The truth remains that people are dying in Haiti, and that these deaths are avoidable. In a state so fragile, lives can be saved for the amount of a book. Our actions now can, and must, account for past transgressions. We have a responsibility to all Haitians to provide them with the tools to rebuild, the tools we have denied them for two hundred years.
If we act now, donations can save lives. Miraculous stories of rescue missions abound, operating rooms have been established, and urgent medical care is being delivered—but the resources are still outstripped by the need for them. As the rescue missions subside, the long-term task of rebuilding the infrastructure and public institutions in Haiti—a task that has often gone without proper international support for 200 years—will continue. As the international spotlight fades from Haiti, this task will become even more difficult.
We must support efforts to rebuild Haiti in the long term—both as donators and as political agents making claims on our government. This requires that public institutions have adequate resources, tertiary education institutions give Haitians preference in admissions, and that jobs for Haitians are created with the recent influx of aid. One organization that is working with the public sector and will continue to work in Haiti after all of the cameras and news media leave is Partners In Health, an NGO that has been operating in Haiti for 25 years delivering free medical care to the rural poor. Before the earthquake struck on Jan. 12, PIH had more than 100 doctors, 600 nurses, and 4,000 employees on the ground in Haiti working from 12 existing PIH medical facilities. It has since established field hospitals in Port-au-Prince, and supported 20 operating rooms in the country. It is organizations like Partners In Health that are clearly in Haiti for the long haul and should be supported in the coming weeks, months, and years with charitable donations.
But as the media withdraws from Haiti, the number of charitable donations will likely decrease. If Haiti is to have enough resources for rebuilding more, wealthy governments will have to make sustained commitments. What is needed is a Marshall Plan for Haiti that tackles problems comprehensively and allows the rebuilding of both physical and public institutions. As citizens, we must not forget that our government’s budget ought to reflect our priorities, and the outpouring of donation and support for Haiti should be seen as a reflection of Americans’ political willingness to support reconstruction. As political agents, we must ensure that our government is held accountable, and that for once Haiti be supported by the international community in an enduring way.

As Anne J. Hathaway proceeded down Mass. Ave atop a fire engine red Bentley convertible, the fair-skinned actress did not seem to mind the chill of the falling snow as scantily clad, cross-dressing men from the Hasty Pudding Theatricals fawned over her.
Hathaway, star of “The Princess Diaries” and “Ella Enchanted,” is no stranger to assuming the trappings of royalty in her films—and yesterday, the Pudding treated its 2010 Woman of the Year with adulation befitting a princess.
Around 2:30 p.m., the parade began its crawl towards New College Theatre, where Hathaway attended a roast held in her honor and a preview of this year’s Pudding production, “Commie Dearest.”
During the roast, the theatrical organization’s president Clifford N. Murray ’10 called Hathaway “the second most famous Anne in the history of keeping a diary,” drawing hearty laughter from the audience.
Hathaway, who called the event “thrilling and wonderful,” may have been the star of the afternoon, but in order to officially collect the Pudding Pot, the starlet had to endure the cutting humor of the event’s hosts and the taunts of the wacky characters that populated the stage.
“What are a few of your favorite things?” Walter B. Klyce III ’10, dressed as Julie Andrews, asked Hathaway when he took the stage.
In response, Hathaway broke into song with several lines from famous film tunes, such as those from “The Sound of Music”—to which Klyce retorted, “I think what you mean to say was appearing topless in movies.”
When Klyce compared Hathaway’s breasts to “a couple of windsocks” dangling in the wind, the actress playfully peeked down her shirt.
Then, a man dressed as Puff the Magic Dragon took the stage to accost Hathaway, who was instructed to slay the creature by a man playing Meryl Streep’s character in “The Devil Wears Prada.”
“Dragon is the new plaid,” the actor said.
After the Pudding actors took their turns skewering Hathaway’s acting resume, she was presented with the gleaming, golden Pudding Pot. Hathaway delivered her prepared acceptance speech in rhyme before returning to her seat in the center of the theater to watch the preview of an upcoming Pudding production.
“My rump is swollen with pride,” Hathaway said in her speech.
As the Woman of the Year, Hathaway joins the ranks of Meryl Streep, Katharine Hepburn, Julia Roberts, and last year’s winner Renee Zellweger.
Justin R. Timberlake, who has been named the Man of the Year, will be honored in a separate ceremony on Feb. 5. While the Grammy Award-winning singer will not be treated to a parade, the Pudding will hold a roast in his honor.
Photographers piled onto a truck ahead of the Bentley carrying Hathaway to snap pictures, and the media descended on Harvard’s campus yesterday to snag a close look at the 27-year-old actress, who has appeared on People Magazine’s list of the 50 most beautiful people in the world.
Despite the freezing temperature, Hathaway finished the parade with a toothy smile.
When asked if she had wished for warmer weather, Hathaway joked, “Personally with my skin tone, I probably would have gotten a sunburn, so the weather was perfect for me.”

After a six-month search for a new executive director, the Cambridge Police Review and Advisory Board will now be able to investigate complaints filed in response to the July 2009 arrest of Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr., professor and director of the W.E.B Du Bois Institute for African and African American Studies.
Marlissa S. Briggett ’88, a civil rights attorney living in Arlington, will serve as executive secretary of the advisory board—a committee of five Cambridge residents responsible for reviewing complaints about the Cambridge Police Department, according to the Cambridge Chronicle.
Following Gates’ arrest, City Manager Robert W. Healy and Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas formed a panel of 12 professionals from across the country to analyze the policies and procedures of the police department and its relationship with the community.
Shortly after the ad hoc panel was assembled, the Police Review and Advisory Board voted to look into three complaints about Gates’ arrest in September, but the lack of official leadership hindered the investigation. The advisory board has been without a director for much of the past year.
The Cambridge Chronicle reported that Briggett will also take on responsibilities as Cambridge’s new executive director of the Human Rights Commission, which investigates discrimination claims in housing, employment, education, and public accommodations.
Briggett, a civil rights attorney, was previously a commissioner on the Arlington Human Rights Commission and an attorney-adviser at the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.
Briggett could not be reached for comment yesterday.

The City of Cambridge will upgrade its current energy use tracking tool to MassEnergyInsight—a new web-based tool launched this week to make Massachusetts greener free of charge, according to the state’s Department of Energy Resources.
To record energy use, Cambridge had been using an earlier version of MassEnergyInsight since 2006, and the new program will now be used to analyze energy use, costs, and emissions across 351 cities and towns.
The new tool boasts a more usable interface and will provide the state with customized data on electricity, natural gas, and oil usage as well as help local officials identify which departments and buildings are wasting energy. The program will also help communities reduce energy use by 20 percent in five years—fulfilling one requirement for receiving the Green Communities Grants Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 announced last week to finance energy efficiency and renewable power projects.
Paul W. Gromer, president of the Peregrine Energy Group of Boston, which created the tool, stressed the importance of aggregating a city’s energy information in one place to streamline costs.
“We gather that information, find a meaning it,” Gromer said. “We take pennies and turn them into ten dollar bills.”
Cambridge has approximately 500 utility accounts, including street lights, traffic lights, and gas and oil heating, according to Ellen F. Katz, fiscal director of the city’s public works department.
City Councillor Henrietta J. Davis said that the complexity and number of the city’s bills impeded energy efficiency efforts before 2006, when Cambridge first adopted the system.
“We’re used to getting one bill at home,” Davis said, “But when you’re talking about something like the city of Cambridge, you’re talking about hundreds of thousands of bills. If you don’t know how you’re using your energy, it’s difficult to increase your efficiency.”
The city later implemented Cambridge GreenSense in October 2008, a program that encourages employee awareness to make simple efforts to save energy. According to Katz, buildings involved in the program saw a 5 percent decrease in energy use over the past year.

A new report found that university endowments declined an average of 18.7 percent in the fiscal year ending June 30, confirmation that Harvard has not been alone in suffering large endowment losses—though the average university’s losses have been significantly less severe.
Of the 842 U.S. universities surveyed, the 52 institutions with endowments valued at $1 billion or more reported the largest declines—an average of 20.5 percent—according to a report released yesterday by the National Association of College and University Business Officers. Harvard’s investment losses this past year amounted to 27 percent of the endowment’s total value, or about $10 billion.
Several of Harvard’s wealthy peer institutions faced similar losses in fiscal year 2009. Last year, Yale’s endowment—higher education’s second largest after Harvard—fell 25 percent, and Stanford’s endowment fell by 27 percent.
Despite last year’s shock to the endowment, Harvard’s endowment returns over the past 10 years have beaten those of university endowments on average, according to figures from NACUBO’s report. Harvard’s endowment has grown 8.9 percent since 1999, while the average university endowment netted a 4 percent gain.
“At Harvard, we’re long-term investors,” University spokesman John D. Longbrake said. “We have a very strong track record.”
The report also found that universities increased their use of “alternative strategies”—branching into private equity, real estate, and commodities—and held more cash and short-term securities in 2009 compared to 2008. The percentage of holdings invested in both domestic and international equities declined on average across universities.
These alternative assets contributed significantly to the decline in Harvard’s endowment—private equity holdings, which represented 13 percent of the University’s portfolio in 2009, fell 31.6 percent. Harvard Management Company’s investment strategies came under fire in the past year for investing the University’s endowment in private equity and other illiquid assets, which could not be sold easily to meet cash obligations.
Similarly, Yale’s endowment managers blamed much of their losses in 2009 on real estate, energy, and commodities.
In a speech yesterday to university financial officers at the NACUBO conference in New York City, HMC’s chief executive Jane L. Mendillo addressed concerns about liquidity and endowment risk management.
“One lesson we have taken away from the last couple of years is that it is essential to reconcile liquidity needs, investment opportunity, and endowment dependence, with our long-term view,” Mendillo said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Cambridge resident Adam W. Fastman and his housemates on 218-220 Putnam Ave. first conceived the idea of raising chickens and ducks in their backyard, they did not foresee that their newfound “pets” would raise so much controversy among their neighbors.
Marcia C. Hamilton, 62, a lifelong resident of Cambridge, names herself as one of those disgruntled individuals. A barbed wire fence separates the yards of her home and, as she calls Fastman’s abode, the “purple house.” Since last spring, when the two chickens and three ducks were first brought into a constructed coop in the adjacent yard, Hamilton said she has been distracted by the unpleasant odors and loud noises that accompanied the birds’ daily habits.
Fastman argued that the chickens are of a carefully selected breed that does not make too much noise, and the smells had wafted from a pool of water that had been created for the ducks and removed at the start of winter.
Regardless, keeping a coop and raising fowl are illegal activities in Cambridge, Hamilton alleged, and for that reason, she called an inspector to her neighbors’ home.
Fastman, his wife Allison J. Fastman, and their housemate Blake R. Brasher­—all co-owners of the birds—were issued a citation stating the illegality of owning a duck or chicken coop and growing livestock or fowl in Cambridge.
Before undertaking their fowl-raising project, the Fastmans and Brasher had researched Cambridge ordinances, and they noted the absence of “chicken coop” on the list of permitted uses—along with items like doghouses and bird feeders that can be easily found in many backyards, Fastman said. Finding no documented regulations against having chickens and ducks as pets in a backyard when they researched the city ordinances, the trio proceeded to build the coop and keep the birds by what they understood to be legal means.
The trio has been appealing the citation and contacted Cambridge City Councillor Henrietta J. Davis to locate the official wording of the zoning laws Hamilton cited.
Davis, who has contacted the city manager for an official report, has not yet responded to the housemates’ inquiry.
On Monday, Hamilton and a group of about 20 neighbors in opposition to keeping the birds attended the City Council meeting to voice their complaints. Fastman attended with a few of his housemates, expecting to hear from Davis about the city manager’s report. Instead, Fastman said they were bombarded by false allegations from neighbors, aside from Hamilton, who had never approached him, Allison J. Fastman, or Brasher in person to complain prior to that meeting.
The next hearing will be held on Feb. 11, and both sides of the conflict hope it will lead to some form of resolution.
Hamilton said that she is most concerned about health hazards the chickens and ducks pose.
“I want the chickens and ducks removed permanently—by force, if necessary,” Hamilton said.
Fastman, an IT manager at a robotics research and development firm, argued that no human has contracted avian flu in North America, and their chickens have not come in contact with other birds that can spread the flu.
Additionally, Fastman contended that the birds have improved his quality of life, and he hopes to keep them in his home, where they have lived since their arrival last spring.
“They’re lovely animals, they have their personalities, they’re very friendly,” Fastman said. “It gives us joy to keep things like this. It makes our yard feel more like home to us.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction and clarifications:
CORRECTION: January 29, 2010
An earlier version of the Jan. 29 news article "Birds in a Cambridge Yard Stir Neighborhood Trouble" and the caption in the accompanying photo stated that Cambridge resident Adam W. Fastman and his housemates live on 218-210 Putnam Ave. The correct address is 218-220 Putnam Ave.
CLARIFICATION: January 29, 2010
An earlier version of the Jan. 29 news article "Birds in a Cambridge Yard Stir Neighborhood Trouble" did not clearly state whether the Fastmans and Brasher began their project with knowledge of its legality. In fact, the trio acquired their chickens and ducks with the understanding that such a move was legal in Cambridge.

The article also stated that the chickens have not come in contact with "pigeons or other birds that can spread the flu." In fact, pigeons cannot contract the avian flu in the first place, as Fastman was told by Richard "Chicken Dick" Gonci, who was at the City Council meeting on Monday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Longtime sports journalist Peter Gammons recounted stories from his four decades of experience covering baseball and the Boston Red Sox, touching on topics ranging from journalistic ethics to steroids use at the First Church in Cambridge Congregational’s Lindsay Chapel last night.
William M. Polk, Cambridge Center for Adult Education president and Gammons’ close friend, opened the event by asking the 2004 Baseball Hall of Fame inductee about the 2010 prospects for the Sox.
Gammons lauded the Red Sox for improving their pitching and shoring up their defense by adding center fielder Michael T. Cameron and third baseman Adrian P. Beltre.
One audience member asked Gammons how he reconciles being a fan and covering games.
“We’re all human beings, and therefore we have the right to like people,” Gammons said. “But we’re journalists, so we don’t have the right to dislike people.”
A pioneer in sports journalism, Gammons became one of the first print sportswriters to move to television and eventually the internet after joining ESPN in 1988. Gammons, who started his career at the Boston Globe, inspired a generation of sportswriters with innovations such as his “Sunday notes” column.
“It was a life change,” Gammons said of moving to ESPN in an interview after the talk. “But it was still the same thing. It was reporting.”
Gammons recently left ESPN for the MLB Network and MLB.com. He said in an official statement last month that he was looking forward to working for a network “devoted to baseball, and baseball only.”
In response to why journalists didn’t dig deeper to expose use of performance-enhancing drugs before it became a national scandal, Gammons responded, “I always suspected it, but I didn’t know. There’s a great deal of remorse for a lot of us for not pushing it.”
Gammons also spoke candidly on broader issues affecting the sport, including professional baseball’s role in Latin America.
As Major League teams are spending more in the Dominican Republic and other Latin American countries, Gammons mused over the possibility of Cuban players in the Majors should U.S.-Cuba relations improve.
Gammons, who traveled to Havana in 1999, described a culture of suspicion among Cuban players driven by social factors such as “snitch lines”—government incentives for citizens to provide incriminating information about their neighbors.
“Trying to break that down is going to be fascinating,” he said.
The discussion, which took place at the First Church in Cambridge Congregational’s Lindsay Chapel, was the first installment of the CCAE’s Home Run in Harvard Square speaking series, which ends in May.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New York, New York.
According to Frank Sinatra, if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
It’s a fitting lyric for the Harvard men’s basketball team, which knows that the road to its first Ivy League championship and just its second NCAA tournament appearance ever—the other coming in 1947—runs through Ithaca, New York.
After a Friday night date in the city with the Columbia Lions, the Crimson will take on the two-time defending Ivy champion Cornell Big Red tomorrow night in a match-up that’s getting an enormous amount of publicity for an Ivy League basketball game due to the two teams' success.
Both Cornell and Harvard are having phenomenal seasons that have seen them knock off big programs while receiving votes multiple times in the national polls. The Crimson (13-3, 2-0 Ivy) has impressive wins over Boston College and William & Mary, while the Big Red (16-3, 2-0) has taken down Alabama and St. John’s. But it may have been in their losses in which the two teams have been the most impressive. Cornell led then-No.1 Kansas for most of their game before eventually falling by five, while Harvard hung tough with then-No.13 Connecticut before losing by six.
It’s rare for an Ivy League team to possess such an impressive resume—let alone two in the same season—and the pundits are starting to take notice. The Big Red received 38 points in the most recent ESPN/USA Today poll, placing it at 27th in the nation. The Crimson has received a top-25 vote in the AP Poll for three consecutive weeks.
For the first time in history, the Ancient Eight has a realistic, though unlikely, chance of being a two-bid league for the Big Dance. And because the conference is the only Division I grouping in the country to not feature a conference tournament, a trip to the tournament is determined by conference record—thus making tomorrow night’s game, along with the Feb. 19 matchup in Cambridge, crucial.
“Honestly, I think it’s very exciting,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I think our kids have worked hard and I think anybody in our league or anybody that plays or loves basketball, wants to be in positions such as this.”
The two teams are centered around their stars, guard Jeremy Lin for Harvard and forward Ryan Wittman for Cornell. Last season, Lin was the only player in the country to finish in the top 10 of his conference in every major statistical category. This year, the Wooden and Cousy award finalist is fourth in the Ivy in points per game (17.1), second in assists per game (4.8), and fourth in blocks per game (1.3). He also ranks fifth in the country in steals per game (2.9).
Wittman, the son of former NBA player and head coach Randy Wittman, is second in the conference in points per game with 18.2, and, as of Thursday, ranked 12th in the country in three pointers made, with 62. The two players are the heavy frontrunners for Ivy League Player of the Year; Wittman has won Ivy player of the week five times, while Lin has done so three times.
“He stretches you and he’s a gunslinger,” Amaker said of Wittman. “He catches it and he’s incredibly quick and fast into his shot...he has good size anyway, but he just gets his shot up so quickly.”
A key matchup is in the front court, where Harvard’s Keith Wright will try to contain Cornell center Jeff Foote, who, at a height of seven feet, has four inches on Wright. Foote leads the conference in rebounds per game; Wright leads in blocks per game and field goal percentage.
“[I’ll defend him] just like any other player in the post,” Wright said. “I’ve played against 7 footers before...so I don’t think it’s any different.”
While Cornell is a veteran team, relying on its senior trio of Wittman, Foote, and point guard Louis Dale for most of its offense, a key to the Crimson’s success has been the play of its three freshman–forward Kyle Casey and guards Christian Webster and Brandyn Curry.
All three have had successful spurts–most recently Casey, the reigning Ivy Rookie of the Week who has averaged over 17 points per game in his five prior contests.
Webster’s sometimes inconsistent shot will have to be on if Harvard is going to be able to go bucket-for-bucket with Cornell, which ranks fourth in the country in three-point shooting.
And Curry will rotate with sophomore guard Oliver McNally in trying to stop Dale, a former Ivy League Player of the Year who leads the conference in assists but has also struggled at times this year.
“We’ve got to play Harvard basketball,” Wright said. “Keep doing what we’ve been doing the whole season–all that starts with defense.”
While the battle with the Big Red has been getting most of the attention, Harvard will have to be careful if it is to make it upstate undefeated. The Crimson travels tonight to New York City to take on a dangerous Columbia team that ranks fifth nationally in three-point shooting. Though Cornell defeated the Lions by a combined 47 points in its previous two games, Columbia could still challenge the Crimson. The Lions feature one of the best scorers in the conference, guard Noruwa Agho.
“The trap and the worry we have as coaches is that we’re thinking of Saturday and not necessarily thinking of Friday,” Amaker said. “Saturday is going to be there and Saturday is going to be a heck of a lot more to us and everyone else that has circled it or is excited about it if we play well and win on Friday.”
If Harvard can emerge from the Lion’s den unscathed, all eyes will turn to Ithaca, which ESPN’s Andy Katz recently deemed his “place to be” this week in college basketball. Darren Everson of The Wall Street Journal added that “the game of the year in college basketball just might be in the Ivy League.” And Sports Illustrated’s Pablo Torre ‘07, a former Crimson sports editor, called it “the most anticipated conference game in decades.”
For Cornell, a win could mean a top-25 berth for the first time since 1950. For Harvard, a victory would open up a path to its first-ever Ivy title. The stakes have never been higher. So start spreading the news.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s ice hockey team has been used to skating as the underdog for most of its current four-game unbeaten streak.
After a disappointing 2-10-2 start, the resurgent Crimson (5-10-3, 5-5-3 ECAC) will see if it can handle the pressure of being the favorite when it squares off with ECAC and Ancient Eight foe Princeton (7-10-2, 3-8-1) Friday night at the Bright Hockey Center.
After failing to get back-to-back victories through its first 14 games of the season, Harvard put together a three-game winning streak that included wins over No. 6 Yale and No. 18 Union. The Crimson followed this streak with a dramatic comeback at Rensselaer, in which Harvard scored three goals in the third period to draw, 3-3.
The tie against the Redhawks was reminiscent of the Crimson’s first game against Princeton this season, when Harvard faced deficits of 2-0 and 3-1 before coming back to knot things up in an overtime finish.
That game against the Tigers seems like a distant memory for the Crimson, as it is now sporting the nation’s fourth-longest active unbeaten streak and is unbeaten (4-0-1) in its last five ECAC contests.
“We’ve really done a better job of establishing our forecheck and putting pucks in the net,” captain Alex Biega said. “We have been better at identifying the strengths on the team, and when we actually execute our game plan we can be dangerous.”
Despite Harvard’s recent improvement, predicting the outcome of Friday’s match-up is no easy task. Princeton is just as streaky as its opponents.
Following the tie with the Crimson, the Tigers lost six consecutive games, only to go 3-0-1 over the next four games. The Tigers followed that run with two home losses to Union and Rensselaer, but stomped Connecticut on Monday, 8-1.
Harvard is poised to go unbeaten in a season against Princeton for the first time in four years, and a clutch win would make the already tight ECAC race all the more dramatic.
After gaining seven points in its last four games to notch a total of 13 on the season, the Crimson is currently in eighth place in the ECAC, with only four points separating Harvard from league-leading Union. With merely nine ECAC games left, it’s clear that anything could happen in the standings as the Crimson seek to gain a coveted first-round bye by finishing in the top four of the ECAC.
“There’s no other way to do it but to win every game,” Biega said.  “We’re past the point where we can really look at how many games we can afford to lose. Taking it step by step is the only way we’ll continue to win.”
The catalyst for Harvard has been freshman Louis Leblanc, who now leads the squad in goals with nine. Leblanc recorded multiple points in three of the games in the Crimson’s unbeaten streak, during which the star rookie totaled five goals and an assist. His performance earned Leblanc back-to-back ECAC Rookie of the Week honors.
“I definitely had to adjust to college hockey,” Leblanc said. “Getting used to a new league full of older and stronger guys new league full of older and stronger guys was tough, but I think we’re all really clicking now.  We’re definitely working harder on and off the ice.”
The Crimson has historically found its best following the exam period. Under coach Ted Donato ‘91, the Crimson is 35-8-8 in league games after the break.
“I think we started off slow, but at some point we realized we were running out of games,” Leblanc said. “We are right back in the race to finish in the top four and we’re excited for Princeton and a chance to come out on top in that series.”
Leblanc’s offense has provided a valuable complement to Harvard’s impressive defensive efforts. The Crimson has killed 17 out of its opponents’ last 18 power plays, and junior goalie Ryan Carroll has stopped 147 of the last 153 shots he has faced.
“Louis’s been very active for us since he stepped on campus,” Biega said. “He’s scoring big goals for us when we need them, and hopefully he keeps up with his hot streak.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Ivy League has gone mainstream. This week alone, it’s reached the pages of The Wall Street Journal, ESPN, and Sports Illustrated.
Most of the attention has swirled around the league’s budding rivalry between Cornell and Harvard, but even the bottom-dwelling Ivies are making news.
Two weeks ago, Denzel Washington talked Penn basketball on the Late Show with David Letterman (the actor’s son, Malcolm Washington, is a freshman guard on the team), and Dartmouth has earned headlines this month first for an alleged player mutiny and later player arrests (testing PT Barnum’s belief that all publicity is good publicity).
For the most part, this coverage is sound and fury signifying nothing. It won’t translate into wins and losses, and no amount of speculation will actually result in the Ivy League earning two NCAA tournament bids. Nevertheless, this unprecedented exposure captures, and even contributes to, the excitement and unique spirit of this season.
For the first time, the Ivy League has two teams that can compete on the national level. The Big Red has taken a championship-caliber team—Kansas—down to the wire, and the Crimson has pushed powerhouses Georgetown and UConn to the limit.
While celebrated Ivy teams of the past have figured on the national stage, they’ve done so with a cerebral style of play befitting their school’s reputation. This season, Cornell and Harvard have shown the ability to match their opponents’ skill and athleticism (search “Kyle Casey from Oliver McNally” or “Errick Peck Bucknell” on YouTube). They’ve defied the stereotypes that have defined Ivy basketball and, in so doing, captured the media’s attention and made stars out of several players.
The result is a storybook season in the making. The attention the Ivy League is receiving isn’t beyond anyone’s wildest dream; it’s what each player has always dreamed of since he started dribbling in his driveway, counting down the seconds to another imaginary buzzer-beater.
Of course the season is still in its infancy. As Crimson coach Tommy Amaker has said, “It’s a long horse race.” The difference this season though, unlike years past, is that everyone is watching.
HARVARD (13-3, 2-0 Ivy) at COLUMBIA (6-10, 0-2)
Although many fans have heralded Saturday’s matchup against the Big Red as the biggest of the season, Friday’s game against the Lions is arguably just as important to Harvard. Given Cornell’s strength, the Crimson cannot afford to lose to an inferior team, since doing so would likely mean having to beat the Big Red twice for a shot at the Ivy title.
Columbia’s Noruwa Agho is an All-Ivy caliber guard capable of carrying a team, but the biggest threat to Harvard is its ability to stay focused. The Crimson must improve on its poor shooting performance at Dartmouth, get over the thrill of Sports Illustrated, and push Saturday’s game against the Big Red out of its mind. Harvard has stayed focused so far this season and will do so again.
Pick: Harvard 74, Columbia 67.
PENN (1-13, 0-0 Ivy) at YALE (7-12, 1-1)
After splitting its season series with Brown, the Elis play host to a Penn team that has struggled all season. The Quakers’ sole win came against the equally hapless University of Maryland, Baltimore County Retrievers. Expect Yale guard Alex Zampier, the league’s leading scorer, to light up the league’s worst defense.
Pick: Yale 79, Penn 63.
DARTMOUTH (4-12, 0-2 Ivy) at CORNELL (16-3, 2-0)
Dartmouth has showed a lot of fight lately. In its last four games, over which coach Terry Dunn was forced to resign and two players were arrested with possession of marijuana, the Big Green has gone 2-2, including a narrow loss to the Crimson last weekend. But the Big Red will be simply too much for it to handle. Cornell has too many weapons to fall prey to an upset of this magnitude. Factor in that Cornell is at home, and the game should be a blowout.
Pick: Cornell 78, Dartmouth 53.
PRINCETON (9-5, 0-0 Ivy) at BROWN (7-12, 1-1)
After starting off 2-4, the Tigers have won seven of their last eight, including a gritty road win at St. Joe’s. The Bears have seven wins, but only one was against a team with a winning record. While Brown has one of the league’s best players in forward Matt Mullery, Princeton is a deeper team and has a few stars of its own in guards Doug Davis and Dan Mavraides. The Tigers play at a slow tempo, and no road game is easy in league play, so look for a close, low-scoring affair.
Pick: Princeton 66, Brown 60.
DARTMOUTH at COLUMBIA
Dartmouth won’t find better luck in New York City. The Cornell-Columbia road trip is brutal, probably the toughest traveling of the season for the Big Green. Columbia will be hungry for its first league win and won’t let the opportunity slide against this feisty but depleted Dartmouth team.
Pick: Columbia 65, Dartmouth 56.
PRINCETON at YALE
Yale has not beaten a team with a winning record thus far. But the second night of a back-to-back will leave Princeton vulnerable. The Tigers would be lucky to escape unscathed against a pair of teams in the second-tier of the Ivy League, but until Yale proves it can take down a strong opponent, I’m giving Princeton the nod.
Pick: Princeton 60, Yale 56.
PENN at BROWN
I don’t see Penn improving much between Friday and Saturday, so again it will be a heavy underdog. But given that Brown is one of the four teams that the Quakers could realistically beat, I see them giving a spirited effort and losing by single digits.
Pick: Brown 70, Penn 61.
HARVARD at CORNELL
This game is the main event. So far this season, the two heavyweights brought out the best in one another. Cornell beat Alabama, then Harvard topped William and Mary. The Crimson scared UConn and Georgetown, and the Big Red spooked Syracuse and Kansas. Each has been good for the other, and, together, they’ve been a great storyline in college basketball.
The difference between these teams is that Cornell has played in big games before. The two-time reigning Ivy champion will be looking to reestablish its position at the top of the league. Newman Arena will be raucous, each team will be fired up, but I see the Big Red ultimately protecting home court.
Pick: Cornell 75, Harvard 68.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former football captain Carl Ehrlich ‘09 left the United States recently to continue playing football in Spain for the Valencia Firebats. While this may be old news, it is important to analyze the ramifications of such a move.
Ehrlich is currently playing for La Liga Nacional de Futbol Americano, a fairly recent league that started up in 1995 after gathering several organizations that had previous football experience. One of those teams was the Valencia Bats, a team composed mainly from the roster of the failed Cullera Giants team. The Bats joined the American Football League (not to be confused with the AFL that was merged into the NFL in 1969) and had a moderately successful season.
Competing with the AFL was the Catalana Football League, and so Spain’s football organizations realized that in order for football to even have a chance in Spain, the leagues needed to be united. The LGNA was created and has been a fairly strong organization since its inaugural season, adding five more teams for the 2010 season. Along with the league’s inception, the Bats changed their name to the current moniker. (More on the Firebats history can be found here, though you may need a translator).
Ehrlich joins a team that in recent years has made major strides to excel on the European football stage. The Firebats won the last three out of four LNFA titles, only failing to win it in 2008.
Because the LNFA is Spain’s top flight for football, the winner and runner-up get the chance to represent the league in the European Football League, the equivalent of the Champions League for soccer. The Firebats’ successes haven’t translated onto the big stage, though, and they have failed to win against many major European opponents. Austria’s Vienna Vikings and Swarco Raiders Tirol have captured the crown for the majority of the past decade, not letting any other country get the title since 2004.
The Firebats are looking to change things around by adding Ehrlich not only to their defensive line but to their offensive line as well. According to Valencia’s website, Ehrlich had a solid effort on both sides of the ball in his first Spanish game, getting a lot of action in its 14-6 victory at home. But it’ll be crucial for Ehrlich to adapt to the different tactics of the Firebats and the scrappy play and strict officiating of European football—he was ejected from his first game for clotheslining an opponent.

Their House may be about 50 years old—just about as old as color television—but that's not stopping Quincy House Masters Lee and Deborah J. Gehrke from giving out some good old-fashioned House love, new media style.
This Tuesday, the Gehrkes decided to welcome Quincy House residents back from J-Term with a YouTube video posted on the House Web site. With the Quincy penguin dancing around on screen and an appearance of Kahlua chocolate mousse pie, the Gehrkes relayed information on House events that took place this week.
"We missed you guys," Deb Gehrke says in the video. "It was boring around here."
It took three takes to get the video just right, Lee Gehrke said, admitting that they "weren't very good at that at first."
But this won't be the last time the Gehrkes make it to the small screen. They're hoping to use YouTube to convey future messages to their students and to encourage other students to use YouTube to promote House spirit.
"Communicating with our students and letting them know what's going on in the House is always a challenge, so we decided to try something new," Lee Gehrke said. "We're hoping it will catch on as a way the students will communicate on the various activities going on in the House."
