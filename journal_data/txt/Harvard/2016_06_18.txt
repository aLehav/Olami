After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At their worst, semesters on campus can feel like hallucinogenic, backlit film blips, the same underdeveloped frames scratching back and forth. By May, though, we remember summer again. The sunlight’s smell, a warm patchouli of every place it has ever touched. Things begin to move and expand, and there’s a special sensation of change, as if my consciousness is some astonishing fruit—perhaps a mango—growing in an oblique, unexpected direction, right out of my imagination’s range. Or as if the edges of my vision are constantly about to come apart, revealing sudden newness beneath, glowing golden-buttered.
Tomorrow, I return to Cambridge after five weeks in St. Louis. I didn’t realize I even had the heart to miss a place as much as I’ve missed Harvard until the taxi carried me past Johnston Gate on my way home. My friend T., who is also on campus for the summer, emailed to tell me about a boy she’d met, the first one she’s ever really liked. I read and reread. It felt like seeing a field of sunflowers, burnt yellow against a stark blue sky. I thought back to when I met T. last August over platters of curry and rice in the Garage. She’d picked up an empty water cup, peeled its thin cylindrical sides into even strips, and folded them down into flower petals. The rest of us all attacked our cups, too, waving our plastic flowers, to the consternation of a restaurant worker, droplets of leftover water flecking our noses and brows.
I was going to write about human misconceptions for this postcard, the self-congratulating and delusional nature of our views about so many things. I was going to write about the inevitable physical and psychological decay of Home. I couldn’t bring myself to send those drafts. (Jonathan Franzen, the inspiration for the latter, has already captured the experience better than I ever could in “Meet Me in St. Louis.”) Not so long ago I sneered at sentimentality, thinking it killed the present; I still usually react to outright cheesiness by swinging my eyeballs as far back into my head as they will go.
These past 10 months, though, at their very best and worst, through people like and unlike T., have made my heart so much bigger. Sometimes we relinquish our myopic happiness, but this week is not the week for that. I can’t wait to walk my old footprints. I’m thinking about all the friends I’m going to see, the people I’m going to meet; I’m thinking about the palette of a sunset filtered down chutes of red brick buildings and streets. Next week, perhaps, I will self-scrutinize, berate, awaken and reset myself in a cold shower of existential unease. For now, I want to stumble around in this city’s summer, melting and reshaping like a Dalí creature; a mango-headed fool, slipping and sliding on all the sidewalks’ potential.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Harvard fans are focused on seeing whether the 2016 recruiting class can live up to its ESPN top-10 ranking this year, the first member of the 2017 recruiting class has chosen to don Crimson.
Mario Haskett, a 6’3’’ guard from Chesterfield, VA, announced via Twitter on Thursday that he would join coach Tommy Amaker’s squad, writing “I’m proud to announce my intentions to commit to Harvard University. #WeSoCrimson.”
Haskett is listed as a three-star recruit on 247sports.com and received 11 collegiate offers, including Cincinnati, Virginia Tech and VCU.
“I picked Harvard because it’s a place where I believe my game can develop and have an opportunity to get to the next level,” Haskett told Scout.com following his commitment. “Also it’s an opportunity for me and my family and my brothers to be set for life...It’s more than a hoop move.”
Though he has not officially gone through the admissions process, Haskett has shown an interest in pursuing engineering as a concentration after participating in his high school’s engineering program. Incoming freshman Chris Lewis has also noted an interest in concentrating in engineering, noting Amaker’s pitch that Harvard is a “40 year decision”, not a four-year one.
Amaker consistently refers to defense as his team’s calling card, making Haskett a good fit for the Crimson as he points to his defensive work as his best asset, referring to it as his “moneymaker”. Though he puts the most weight on defense, Haskett has also been a strong scorer for his team, averaging just over 11 points per game in his junior season and expecting to take on an even greater load in his final season at L.C. Bird.
This past season, Amaker often had to choose between offense and defense at the shooting guard position. While freshman Corey Johnson got the majority of the minutes at the two position, Amaker flip-flopped between Johnson and sophomore Andre Chatfield when things were close, with Johnson entering the game for offensive possessions and Chatfield subbing in on defense.
Also according to Scout.com, Haskett will make his first official visit to Harvard on Sept. 17th, the same weekend that top-five, five-star recruit Wendell Carter is expected to make his way to Cambridge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just a few days before its Copa America Centenario quarterfinal matchup against South American rival Venezuela at Gillette Stadium, the Argentinian National Soccer Team stationed itself at Harvard’s Ohiri Field to partake in training this week.
The Argentinian “La Albiceleste” team, one of the favorite teams to win the trophy in the 100-year anniversary of the prolific South American competition, began practicing on the Harvard field Wednesday afternoon and will continue to practice through Friday, according to a press release from the Argentine Football Association prior to the team’s arrival.
The quarterfinal matchup is the final of three matches hosted at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, a venue that normally hosts the New England Patriots. Other matchups featured at Gillette included Brazil vs. Peru and Chile vs. Bolivia.
One hundred years after Uruguay won the first-ever title in 1916, the Copa America is being hosted outside of South American soil for the first time in its history as part of the commemorative celebration.
The Copa America, which is normally hosted every four years, is an internationally renowned competition between the national teams of the South American countries who make up CONMEBOL, the continent’s governing soccer body. Since 1993, CONMEBOL has invited other nations, predominantly North and Central American or Caribbean countries such as Mexico, USA, and Costa Rica, to partake in the tournament as well.
Though the last tournament was held in 2015, a special edition of Copa America is being held in the United States this summer as part of a deal between CONMEBOL and CONCACAF, the governing soccer body for North America, Central American, and Caribbean countries, where the Copa was hosted by a non-CONMEBOL member for the first time to celebrate the 100-year anniversary. Officials have also expanded the field to 16 teams, as opposed to the normal 12.
Argentina, a historically dominant soccer team, won all three of its games in the group stages to top Group D with a maximum nine points and will face Group C runner-up Venezeula, who finished behind Mexico.
Featuring a roster full of soccer stars including Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero, Paris Saint-Germain’s Angel DiMaria, and FC Barcelona’s Lionel Messi—considered by many to be the best player in the world and one of the best of all time­—the Argentines will be favorite to walk away with the victory.
The winner between Argentina and Venezuela will face off against the United States, who won its quarterfinal matchup against Ecuador by a 2-1 margin, in a semi-final clash in Houston, Texas.
