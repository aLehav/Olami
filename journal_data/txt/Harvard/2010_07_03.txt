After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Former Harvard student Adam B. Wheeler, who pled not guilty in May for fabricating an elaborate academic history, was released from jail after his $5,000 bail was posted on June 14, the Middlesex Sheriff's Office confirmed on Saturday.
On May 18, Wheeler pled not guilty to 20 counts of larceny, identity fraud, falsifying an endorsement or approval, and pretending to hold a degree. Prosecutors allege that the Delaware native submitted plagiarized letters of recommendations, fake transcripts, and fraudulent SAT scores in his transfer application to Harvard. He also allegedly submitted fraudulent documents when applying for the Rhodes and Fulbright Scholarships.
After his dismissal from Harvard in the fall of 2009, Wheeler applied to Yale, Brown, and Stanford as a transfer student, as well as to McLean Hospital for an internship in January 2010. Stanford, which had accepted Wheeler as an incoming junior, revoked his admission upon learning of his fraudulent schemes.
Wheeler, who arrived at Harvard in 2007 as a sophomore, was a resident of Kirkland House and won a Hoopes prize in his junior year for a paper that was later found to be plagiarized.
His hearing date is set for Aug. 9.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University’s difficult financial situation rendered contract negotiations between the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers and University management particularly challenging in the past year, according to leaders of both parties.
HUCTW and the University entered the eighth round of negotiations with differing opinions on Harvard’s ability to increase wages and extend benefits in subsequent years, leading to a tentative two-year contract agreement on Wednesday—a divergence from the three-year contracts that have been the norm since the union’s founding in 1989.
The union and University management also disagreed on whether Harvard’s finances are improving and will continue to improve, according to HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger, who could not elaborate further on the specifics of the discrepancy in opinions. Harvard’s Director of Labor Relations Bill Murphy similarly declined to detail the points of disagreement.
“These were challenging negotiations, but the parties worked together respectfully and we consider this a successful agreement which reflects the economic times,” Murphy wrote in a statement.
Echoing Murphy’s sentiments, Jaeger said that the recent negotiations occurred within what was likely “the most difficult set of external circumstances we’ve ever had to contend with,” in reference to the roughly $11 billion that Harvard’s endowment lost in the 2008 market crash. But Jaeger added that negotiating parties were able to “work out something that we think will work in such difficult financial times.”
The tentative agreement offers a 2.58 percent average pay increase to HUCTW members over the next two years, with an a $1,000 raise for all HUCTW members this year, and a 3.5 percent salary increase for the majority of union members—significantly less than the salary increases in the 4 to 4.5 percent range outlined in the previous contract.
“The economics are not as strong as they have been in other times, but those were times of greater prosperity and economic growth,” said Jaeger of the decrease in pay raises, adding that the union is “very proud” of policy changes in the contract.
In what seems to be a reactive measure to the slew of staff cuts that swept through the University during the budget crisis last year, the new contract features offers details on the University’s layoff procedures. Specifically, an individual’s length of service will be the determining factor in job cuts when the University cannot demonstrate differences in employees' qualifications, abilities, function, or documented performance, according to a Harvard official close to negotiations who wished to remain anonymous because the contract remains tentative. 
The new agreement includes strong language that seeks to ensure that the Union and the University work together to manage layoffs. Though such a measure was already in place, Jaeger said he hopes to make sure that union-management collaboration happens "earlier and more meaningfully."
“The worst of any layoff experience for our members is almost certainly behind us,” said Jaeger, in reference to the layoffs of about 100 union members last year.
The Harvard official confirmed that “currently, there are no plans for any layoff announcements.”
The new contract expresses a commitment on behalf of the union and the University to determine when it is appropriate to hire employees for “term jobs,” positions with a designated end date, usually one to two years from the time of hiring, which can be extended by the employer. The issue has been a source of tension between union members and the University, since employees whose jobs end on the specified date after less than two years of employment do not receive unemployment benefits.
Both HUCTW and Harvard officials agree that “term jobs” are appropriate in times when a funding source or a the duration of a specific project are limited—such as recent digitizing projects, or a position associated with a grant. But some HUCTW officials argue that the University’s use of term jobs can border on abusive.
But Jaeger, who said he was pleased with the stipulation in the new contract, expressed a more tempered view of the situation of temporary workers, saying that it was “not an outrage” but “a serious concern.”
“If we disagree now we’ve got a way to investigate and resolve it together, and to go to mediation if necessary,” Jaeger said. “I don’t think it’s an overnight fix, but it’s the beginning of a new process.”
The new contract also increases the size of the union’s membership by granting union eligibility to non-exempt jobs in salary grade 56, or Harvard employees who earn between $49,800 and $82,000 a year—a salary grade higher than was previously covered in the contract. The change will lead to "important new career development opportunities for current Union members," according to an e-mail from HUCTW leadership to union members.
Additionally, there will be no cuts in union member’s benefits, such as health care, tuition assistance, and retirement.
Both HUCTW and University officials attribute their ability to reach a satisfactory agreement in difficult conditions to their particularly strong relationship.
“It’s a good thing that we have a mature partnership, and a lot of good relationships and built up respect between union and University leaders,” Jaeger said. “We needed all of that to make things work in this round of negotiations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brien Battiste—described as skilled guitarist, hungry intellectual, devoted friend, and even underground journalist—defies simple categorization. In light of his recent passing, friends have shared memories that are duly reflective of a multifaceted character who lived life with passion.
Battiste, an Adams House resident in the class of 2010, took his own life in his Boston apartment last Friday, just weeks after he had moved in, his friends confirmed.
The 22-year-old economics concentrator—who arrived at Harvard in the fall of 2006—took a health leave in December 2008 and returned to campus briefly the following fall. At Harvard, Battiste immersed himself in the arts, impressing those around him with his hybrid of intelligence and integrity.
“Surrounded by the users, social-climbers and name-droppers of Harvard, Brien’s moral aptitude was a blessing to all who knew him,” wrote Harry T. Rimalower ’10, one of the directors of Ivory Tower, in a message to The Crimson. “Armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of philosophy and the latest in psychologic research, Brien’s sense of right and wrong was a compass to me.”
His sophomore year, Battiste became involved in the production of Ivory Tower, Harvard’s online soap opera series. Battiste produced and acted for part of a season, and worked as the business chair for the production.
“He was committed to pretty much everything he did,” said Steven J. DeMarco, an Extension School graduate who starred in that season’s run. He recalled Battiste’s diligence in editing the score for a film co-produced by DeMarco: “He stayed up for three days straight in Hilles, and he put everything else aside.”
“He didn’t harbor any resentments and prejudices against anybody,” DeMarco added. “He always brought life and energy and vitality to every situation.”
At Big Bear High School in California, Battiste served as student body president—after campaigning under the slogan “Vote Red,” in reference to his hair color—and invited motivational speakers to address students, effectively “changing the culture of the school, making it a more positive spot,” said Big Bear teacher Michael A. Harrison.
“I don’t think Brien really understood the impact he had on people,” said Harrison, who mentored the student throughout his high school career. “I understood the impact he had on the people around him—I wish he understood how important he was to others.”
Harrison, who taught Battiste in English class his sophomore year, said that he gave the student more difficult work than the others because Battiste was “just operating in a different realm.” He required “intellectual stimulation in any arena” and thirsted to know everything, said Harrison, adding that the student’s hyper-intelligence often translated into bluntness.
“He was kind of a double-edged sword: he could be incredibly inspiring, helpful, and kind, but other people might have experienced him in a different way,” Harrison said. “He could be a little caustic, a little direct, and he could challenge people.”
During his senior year of high school, Battiste began an underground newspaper called The Captain’s Log—a “huge hit” that featured “pirate-themed satirical news,” according to the paper’s co-founder Chris Gromek, who said he was surprised that the enterprise had not gotten the pair expelled from school.
“The administration officially didn’t condone it, but they all secretly read it and loved it,” Gromek wrote in a message to The Crimson. “Brien used to carry around an ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] card in his pocket and wave it around anytime someone said we couldn’t print that sort of stuff.”
High school friend Brett M. Croxton—who remembers late night excursions to Denny’s and games of Risk with his friend—said that Battiste possessed a remarkable capacity for learning. After all, he was once able to make a 100-foot jump while skiing in Oregon, landing a back flip like a professional, Croxton recalled.
Yet another point of mastery for Battiste was the guitar. After just one year of instruction under Harrison, then-high school junior Battiste signed himself up to compete in the battle of the bands, and went on to actually win the competition the next year. Battiste’s performance inspired Harrison—who had played the guitar for many years but never performed for a crowd—to conquer his fear of playing in public.
“He really used it to express himself and his emotions,” DeMarco said of Battiste’s love for the guitar, adding that Battiste—who had stayed with DeMarco for a few months in the past year—would wake up and play throughout the day until 2 a.m.
Adding to his list of accomplishments, Battiste was on the Board of Directors of SolSolution, a non-profit organization that seeks to generate sustainable solutions for renewable energy. Battiste organized the capital accumulation campaign and contributed to the group’s strategic planning as a volunteer, according to the organization’s website.
“Brien was so inspiring to me and really passionate about making our world better,” said Soren D. Harrison, founder and chief executive officer of SolSolution. Battiste worked for the organization for more than a year during his time at Harvard, but dropped off in his involvement in 2009.
“No matter what life throws at you, you can achieve really great success,” Harrison said, recalling the day that Battiste learned he had gotten accepted into Harvard, his dream school. “That’s what’s so disappointing and [why I’m] angry about his death is that he didn’t really get to achieve what he wanted to.”
“It’s hard to relate how deeply I miss Brien and what a huge hole he’s left in a lot of people’s lives,” Gromek wrote. “For me in particular, it was like losing a brother.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Canada won the gold medal in women’s hockey at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, fans north of the border celebrated a well-deserved, third-straight title in the event. But back in America, fans were disappointed that the U.S. women had once again fallen short, claiming a single gold medal to the Canadians' three.
It was only natural, then, that USA Hockey would recruit Crimson coach Katey Stone—who has racked up the most wins in the history of women's college hockey—as the head coach of the national team for the 2010-2011 season.
“She’s long overdue for another shot with the national team,” said Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08, a defenseman for the U.S. team, about Stone and the June 24th announcement of her appointment. “Her success at Harvard speaks for itself.”
“She’ll bring together a lot of knowledge and an enthusiasm that will be contagious,” Julie Chu ’06-’07 added.
Stone's coaching accomplishments at Harvard make for a lengthy list.
In 16 seasons with the Crimson, she has led the Harvard team to the 1999 National Championship and followed up with three straight NCAA Championship appearances in 2003, 2004, and 2005. Under her direction, the Crimson has garnered five ECAC tournament titles, six ECAC regular season titles, and 10 Beanpot titles. Only twice in the history of the NCAA tournament has Stone’s team failed to qualify.
“At the NCAA level where schools get 18 scholarships it’s difficult as an Ivy League team to make the tournament,” Cahow said. “She brings Harvard to the tournament every year. That really says something.”
But Stone's accomplishments reverberate far beyond Harvard. Most recently, she led the United States to the Four Nations Cup title in 2008— its first since 2003—and coached the U18 team to the International Ice Hockey Federation World Championships.
Despite her success at both the collegiate and national levels, Stone has never coached an Olympic squad. After the U.S. team replaced men’s hockey alumnus Ben Smith ’68—who coached the women’s hockey team in its first three trips to the winter Olympics—Stone was one of three finalists to coach the Vancouver squad, but USA Hockey ultimately selected Wisconsin’s head coach Mark Johnson.
Though Stone has never coached an Olympic squad, her influence has been far from absent in the Games. In the inaugural women’s hockey Olympic Championship, two Crimson skaters—A.J. Mleczko ’98-‘98 and Angela Ruggiero ’02-’04—helped the United States take the gold medal in Nagano, while Jennifer Botterill ’02-’03 took silver with Team Canada.
Of the three, Botterill proved to be the most successful in the Olympics. The Canadian went on to follow her Nagano Silver with gold medals in Salt Lake City, Torino, and Vancouver. Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09 also made a successful leap from Cambridge to Team Canada, earning gold medals in Torino and Vancouver, while Chu and Cahow have made their mark on Team USA.
In this year’s gold medal game, as in 1998 and 2002, a victory on either side would have brought gold medals to Stone’s former players. Five of those six players won Patty Kazmaier Awards, with Botterill winning the award twice. The sixth, Cahow, came to Cambridge as a third-line forward—but Stone saw in her the makings of a great defenseman.
“I wasn’t necessarily the most talented player,” Cahow said. “She could see that I had a solid work ethic. She saw that I had abilities that weren’t being utilized at the forward position, so she switched me to defense. I fit into the game a lot better.”
By the end of her sophomore year, Cahow’s blue line abilities were enough to earn her a spot on the 2006 U.S. Olympic team.
“She’s able to see those innate things in each player,” Cahow said. “I think that ability to see those things makes her a great visionary and a great coach.”
Stone’s ability to bring victory to Bright Hockey Center and develop Olympic level talent hadn’t been enough to get her the coaching position for Vancouver. But after the 2009-10 college hockey season, Stone’s accomplishments—including her newly minted coaching record—made her hard to ignore.
Success was anything but guaranteed to Harvard last year. The team had graduated its top three scorers the year before, opened its season without one of its top forwards, junior Liza Ryabkina, and lost its record setting goaltender, Christina Kessler ’10, by the end of January. But by the end of the season, the Crimson had won the Beanpot and earned the fourth seed in the NCAA tournament.
“When injuries arise, other players have to step up,” Chu said. “I think Coach Stone creates an environment that allows them to step into those roles…She gives them an environment for them to reach their potential and perform.”
But Chu emphasized the Stone’s guidance extends beyond the ice.
“She’s equally invested in helping us as women to be strong and have great sound morals,” Chu said. “I’ve appreciated everything she’s guided me through.”
As her former players tell it, Stone’s qualities as a mentor, as well as her impressive knowledge of the sport, make her a great choice to lead the national team.
“She’s got a great mentality for the national team level,” Cahow said. “She’s very business oriented, very professional. For a female coach, that’s really exceptional. She is able to separate herself and stand as an authority figure and someone to look up to. She does her job with a great sense of decorum.”
Stone has been a winner since college, where she won the national lacrosse title with UNH in 1985. After Stone, a two-time All American in lacrosse, reached the highest pinnacle in that sport, she made a name for herself on the ice and led UNH to two ECAC titles in college before establishing herself as a top college hockey coach with the Crimson.

If you don’t remember the last time you left the Square, it’s probably because, well, you just haven't. For an inexcusably long time. The sort of time that traverses past spring semester, the barren terrain of J-Term, and maybe even those deceptively serene days following fall move-in day. Get the point?
 
If not, the point is that you should probably crawl out from under that rock called Harvard (if you're here for the summer) and explore the bounty of events that awaits your fresh faces in Cambridge. The city has a series of exciting events lined up, many of which are outdoors, free, and within walking distance from the Square. Here are a few college-friendly ones:
 
 
Boomtown Festival 2010 (July 8 and 15, 6:30 p.m.)
This concert will feature free bluesy, jazzy, and soulful music, dance, and visual arts. So grab your picnic blanket (or that ratty towel that you like to use as an alternative, no big deal) and your friends, and take a walk down to Centanni Courtyard. 
They Gotta Be Secret Agents (June 13, 11:00 a.m.)
The puppetry show at the Donnelly Field will consist of short segments of clowning, video, dance, puppetry, and theatre flow.
Inkas Wasi (July 28)
 Held at Sennott Park, this event will feature a Peruvian music and dance performance by artists in current day Andean costumes and with traditional Inka flutes, unique percussions, and string-instruments.
Alastair Moock (August 5, 11:00 a.m.)
Mixing music and humor, the American folk musician will perform at the Kennedy Longfellow School Playground to showcase his music, anecdotes from his tour, and American history, to entertain and educate his audience.
Chinese Dance (August 17, 11:00 a.m.)
 Founder and director of the Chu Ling Dance Academy, choreographer Chu Ling, will perform at the Hoyt Field for a range of audiences. She has performed at several colleges and universities in the Cambridge and Boston area, including Harvard.
Jungle Jim's Big Balloon Show & Inman Square Neighborhood Movie Night and Social (August 19, 7:30 p.m.)
A two-in-one package featuring a juggling show and balloonist, this event will be followed by a free move screening co-sponsored by the Inman Square Business Association. If you’re up for a night of family-friendly nice outing before a long weekend of fun, head over to East Cambridge Savings Bank parking lot.
