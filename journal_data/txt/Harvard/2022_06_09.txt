After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her opinion piece, Natalie L. Kahn whitewashes Israel’s apartheid regime and misrepresents both the BDS movement and my personal views.
Basic facts about BDS are worth reiterating. Inspired by South Africa’s anti-apartheid struggle and the U.S. Civil Rights movement, BDS is rooted in decades of Palestinian nonviolent resistance. It was launched in 2005 by the broadest Palestinian coalition, calling for ending Israel’s military occupation that began in 1967, upholding the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their lands that they had been ethnically cleansed from since 1947-1948, and ending Israel’s apartheid “regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea,” as the leading Israeli human rights organization, B’Tselem, describes it.
B’Tselem is not alone. Following the lead of many Palestinian, South African, and international human rights advocates and experts, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have also designated Israel as an apartheid state. The latter’s report concluded that Israel treats all Palestinians as “an inferior non-Jewish racial group.” A former Israeli Attorney General has also weighed in saying: “You simply cannot be a liberal democracy if you operate apartheid over another people. It is a contradiction in terms because Israel’s entire society is complicit in this unjust reality.”
In its struggle to dismantle this regime of oppression, the BDS movement has consistently opposed all forms of racism, including antisemitism, witnessing an inspiring rise in support among Democrats and Jewish-Americans. It belongs to the intersectional progressive wave that upholds what Angela Davis calls, the “indivisibility of justice.” It joins Indigenous, racial, economic, gender, BGLTQ, climate, and social justice struggles in the fight against fascism, racism, white supremacy, patriarchy, and neoliberalism.
Reflecting on these cross-struggle bonds and expressing a widely shared analysis among U.S. progressives, congresswoman Cori Bush once said: “The fight for Black lives and the fight for Palestinian liberation are interconnected. We oppose our money going to fund militarized policing, occupation, and systems of violent oppression and trauma. … [W]e are anti-apartheid. Period.”
Finally, the BDS movement takes no position on the ultimate political solution. I personally do. But Kahn repeats a distorted and misleading interpretation of my position promoted by the right-wing Israel lobby group AIPAC. Here’s what I actually said:
“A Jewish state in Palestine in any shape or form cannot but contravene the basic rights of the indigenous Palestinian population and perpetuate a system of racial discrimination that ought to be opposed categorically.
“Just as we would oppose a ‘Muslim state,’ or a ‘Christian state,’ or any kind of exclusionary state, definitely, most definitely, we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine. No Palestinian, rational Palestinian, not a sell-out Palestinian, will ever accept a Jewish state in Palestine.
“Accepting modern-day Jewish-Israelis as equal citizens and full partners in building and developing a new shared society, free from all colonial subjugation and discrimination, as called for in the democratic state model, is the most magnanimous, rational offer any oppressed indigenous population can present to its oppressors. So don’t ask for more.”
What’s wrong with a non-racial democracy and equal rights for all?
Omar Barghouti is the co-founder of the BDS movement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 9, 2022 at 2:25 a.m.
Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow will step down in June 2023 after just five years in office, ending a pandemic-stricken tenure in which he oversaw a radical transformation of the University’s operations due to Covid-19 and steered the school through the political turmoil of the end of the Trump era.
Bacow, who announced his departure Wednesday afternoon, will be one of the shortest-serving Harvard presidents of the modern era, tying Lawrence H. Summers for the shortest tenure since the Civil War. Prior to his time in Massachusetts Hall, Bacow sat on the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing board, for seven years.
“There is never a good time to leave a job like this one, but now seems right to me,” Bacow wrote in a four-paragraph email to Harvard affiliates announcing his departure on Wednesday. “Through our collective efforts, we have found our way through the pandemic. We have worked together to sustain Harvard through change and through storm, and collectively we have made Harvard better and stronger in countless ways.”
The Harvard Corporation and its incoming senior fellow, Penny S. Pritzker ’81, will lead the search for Bacow’s successor. In an email to Harvard affiliates Wednesday, Pritzker and outgoing Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72, who is set to leave the board at the end of June, offered few details about the search process, writing only that they will reveal more “before long.”
Bacow, 70, was selected as Harvard’s 29th president in 2018 after he stepped off the committee tasked with finding a candidate for the post to be considered for the job himself. During his first four years in office, he has led the school through one of its most tumultuous stretches — the Covid-19 pandemic — and championed some higher education issues at the national level.
Bacow’s presidency shifted drastically in March 2020 when Harvard emptied its campus at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, making it one of the first schools to send students home. Harvard took a largely conservative approach to managing the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, keeping most students away from campus and maintaining strict public health protocols.
Bacow himself tested positive for the virus just two weeks after students vacated campus in March 2020 — the first of two bouts he has had with the disease.
Bacow also steered Harvard through the political headwinds of the Trump administration, which publicly clashed with the school on multiple occasions.
In July 2020, shortly after Covid-19 hit, Harvard sued the federal government over new federal immigration rules that would have barred international students attending colleges and universities offering only online courses from staying in the United States, prompting the Trump administration to eventually reverse its guidelines.
Trump himself took aim at Harvard at several points throughout his presidency. In April 2020, after The Crimson reported that Harvard was set to receive nearly $9 million from a federal stimulus program passed by Congress, Trump called on the University to “pay back” the money. Under pressure from an array of GOP lawmakers, Harvard eventually said it would not accept any of the federal funds.
Bacow also led Harvard as it was pulled to the forefront of the debate over the use of race in college admissions. A 2014 lawsuit challenging Harvard College’s race-conscious admissions policies is set to be taken up by the Supreme Court in the fall, putting in doubt the future of affirmative action in American higher education. During Bacow’s tenure, the school won a trial in federal court in Boston over the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, along with a subsequent appeal.
Under Bacow, Harvard took a major step in reckoning with its ties to the institution of slavery, acknowledging in a landmark report released in April that slavery “powerfully shaped Harvard.” Upon the release of the report, the Harvard Corporation committed $100 million to redress the University’s slavery ties.
Bacow’s tenure was not marked by the controversy or tumult characteristic of the Summers era. But in September 2019, Bacow used the 13th Amendment to compare Harvard’s donors with slaves — a remark he later apologized for.
Bacow often clashed with campus activists during his presidency — including students and alumni calling for the University to divest its endowment from fossil fuels. Bacow for years voiced opposition to divestment, arguing the University’s endowment should not be used for political means. But in a surprise move, he announced in September 2021 that Harvard would allow its remaining investments in the fossil fuel sector to expire.
Bacow also oversaw the end of a high-profile controversy that began under his predecessor, Drew G. Faust, who presided over an effort to sanction members of single-sex social groups on campus. In June 2020, Harvard dropped the social group sanctions following a Supreme Court decision on sex discrimination. The College first announced sanctions in 2016, seeking to prevent members of final clubs and single-gender Greek organizations from receiving fellowships, athletics captaincies, and leadership posts in extracurricular groups. The controversial sanctions were first applied to the Class of 2021.
Bacow’s tenure was also marked by the continued expansion of Harvard’s campus in Boston’s Allston neighborhood, where the school has run into intense opposition from local residents and officials.
The search for Bacow’s successor is likely to begin soon. The last presidential search lasted seven months, while the selection of Bacow’s predecessor, Faust, took almost a year.
With Lee, the Corporation’s senior fellow, and Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp stepping down from their posts this summer, Bacow’s announcement coincides with a major shakeup of the University’s top leadership.
“Like just about everyone who comes here, I was in awe of the place—its history, its reputation, and its impact on all of American higher education,” Bacow wrote Wednesday. “Fifty years later, I am still in awe but for different reasons.”
“I have never been prouder to be part of this University than I am today,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s announcement on Wednesday that he will step down in June 2023 is the latest in a string of departures from Harvard’s top leadership.
William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, will leave the University’s highest governing body at the end of this month after serving on the board for a dozen years; Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, who oversees campus services, finances, and administration, will step down this summer after more than a decade in the role; and Philip W. Lovejoy, the executive director of the Harvard Alumni Association, will conclude a 20-year run at the University when he departs in December.
Bacow will leave his post after just five years in office, tying Lawrence H. Summers for the shortest presidency since the Civil War. The search for Bacow’s successor, which will be led by the Corporation, is expected to begin soon.
The Board of Overseers — Harvard’s second-highest governing board after the Corporation — sees annual turnover by design. In May, the body elected seven new members and selected Paul L. Choi ’86 to lead the organization for the next year.
Meredith L. Weenick ’90, who has served as Harvard’s vice president for campus services since 2014, will serve as Lapp’s successor. Penny S. Pritzker ’81, a Chicago billionaire who has served as a fellow on the Harvard Corporation since 2018, will replace Lee as senior fellow when he is term-limited off of the board this month. Tracy P. Palandjian ’93 will fill the remaining vacancy on the Corporation.
“Having a lot of transitions at once is difficult because you lose a lot of institutional memory and expertise, but by the same token it gives the incoming president the ability to start new kinds of relationships, perhaps to change direction,” said former University Provost Steven E. Hyman. “This amount of turnover is costly in terms of lost expertise, but it’s also an opportunity to look at things afresh.”
Richard Chait, an education governance expert who serves as a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, called the upcoming Harvard leadership changes “pretty normal.” He noted that Bacow, Lapp, and Lee have all held key positions at the school for at least a decade. (Bacow served on the Corporation for seven years prior to his presidency.)
“It’s not that they do it in unison, but there is a molting, a rhythm to academic institutions,” Chait said. “I don’t see anything unusual or symptomatic about that at all.”
Chait expressed optimism that the upcoming transitions in Harvard leadership will proceed smoothly.
“I don’t think you’ll see a stutter step or misstep because three or four key people are leaving the institution,” Chait said, noting that the departures are staggered over a year.
Despite the impending shifts in Harvard’s upper echelons, some key players remain, including University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75. Garber has held Harvard’s top academic office since 2011, while Finnegan first joined Harvard leadership as a fellow of the Harvard Corporation in 2012.
Though Harvard’s next year will be marked by changes in top personnel, Chait said the future of the University extends beyond the individuals holding its highest posts.
“Leadership transitions always — and rightly — are seen as major points of demarcation, and it’s an easy way to mark an institutional era,” he said. “But there also is a strong self-sustaining aspect to universities that I think might put a little less of a premium on the single leader.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sadé Abraham will serve as the new senior director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, the College announced Tuesday.
Abraham formerly served as interim assistant director for the foundation, as well as its first-generation, low-income student advocate. She also founded and directed the First-Year Retreat Experience, a pre-orientation program designed to equip FGLI students with the tools to navigate Harvard and take ownership of their undergraduate experience.
Abraham wrote in an email that her former posts at the school have allowed her to better understand the “multidimensional entities that make Harvard special.”
“I hope to apply this lens (and the skills therein) to my directorship by making the HF a hub and connecting point for students,” she wrote.
Established in 1981, the Harvard Foundation aims to improve intercultural and race relations across the University to “enhance the quality of our common life.”
The foundation engages Harvard students through year-long professional development internships and its Student Advisory Committee — a collective of representatives from more than 90 student organizations across Harvard committed to promoting dialogue about different aspects of identity, including ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation. Interns also offer diversity trainings and consultations to interested student organizations in the College.
Abraham, who called the new appointment an “incredible honor,” will take the baton from Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07, who assumed the post in April 2020.
“The Harvard Foundation has always played a critical role in the cultivation of community and the development of an enriching student experience, and I am committed to building on that success for Harvard students in the years to come,” Abraham said in a press release. “This work is deeply personal to me, and I am excited for the opportunity to lead us into the next chapter of the Harvard Foundation story.”
The Foundation’s hallmark programming includes its annual Humanitarian Award, whose recipients include Burmese politician and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi as well as former United Nations Secretary General and Harvard Kennedy School alum Ban Ki-moon. In March, after a two-year hiatus from in-person festivities due to Covid-19, the Foundation presented the 36th iteration of its Cultural Rhythms — a festival that celebrates Harvard’s diversity through student performances, art, and cuisine — and named Grammy and Academy Award-winning musician Lady Gaga its Artist of the Year.
Associate Dean for Inclusion and Belonging Alta Mauro lauded Abraham’s return to the foundation.
“We are thrilled to welcome [Sadé] to the role of Senior Director of the Harvard Foundation,” Mauro wrote in an email. “Her experience, enthusiasm, and commitment to building an inclusive community for every single Harvard College student will help position the Foundation to further advance the mission of the College.”
A 2018 alum of the Graduate School of Education, Abraham went on to co-found Kairos Learning, a venture that aims to provide FGLI college students exposure to institutions of higher learning through virtual reality experiences. The venture’s website describes Kairos Learning as using “choose-your-own-ending simulation gaming” to make students more comfortable navigating academic environments.
Abraham wrote that she looks forward to advancing the Foundation’s “flagship programming” and celebrating its more than 40-year history as she assumes the post.
“All of our initiatives strive to enhance the community for various affinity groups and student experiences,” she wrote. “Just knowing that our work and any number of our events can facilitate deeper inquiry, engagement, and a sense of belonging pushes me to ensure that everything we do is done with a spirit of excellence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following reports last week that Harvard University holds the human remains of at least 19 individuals who were likely enslaved and nearly 7,000 Native Americans, the Cambridge City Council adopted a policy order urging the University to relinquish the remains to their descendants during a Monday meeting.
The policy order, sponsored by Councilor E. Denise Simmons and passed unanimously, calls on “Harvard University to work as quickly and deliberately as possible to ensure that the human remains of the nearly 7,000 indigenous peoples and 19 enslaved individuals currently in their possession are released to the appropriate parties.”
Last week, The Crimson reported that an unfinalized draft report, produced by a committee tasked with studying how Harvard should treat human remains in its museum collections, calls on the University to return the remains of the people who were likely enslaved to their descendants and accelerate its return of Native American human remains, which has been mandated by federal law since 1990.
“In order to allow these individuals to at last rest in peace, it is imperative that the University move with all due speed, care, and deliberation to ensure that these remains are turned over to the appropriate parties for the proper, respectful burial they deserve,” Simmons said during the meeting.
In an interview, Simmons said she felt the city had to publicly call on Harvard to return the human remains for the sake of “building historical record.”
“I think it’s important that the city acknowledge this moment and go on the public and permanent record in taking a stand,” she said.
The policy order cites the University’s release of a landmark report detailing the “integral” role slavery played in shaping the school, calling on Harvard to “acknowledge and atone for its past grave misdeeds.”
“While Harvard University can no more erase its past misdeeds any more than the United States can erase its own shameful history around slavery and the treatment of indigenous people, it can and it must work to atone for these past sins in efforts to move towards a more holistic path forward, just as our country itself must strive to do,” the order reads.
The draft report, obtained by The Crimson last month, was created by Harvard’s Steering Committee on Human Remains in Harvard Museum Collections, convened in January 2021. The draft, dated April 19, is unfinalized, meaning its language, findings, and recommendations are subject to change as the committee finishes its process.
The Council’s order calls for a copy of the passed resolution to be forwarded to University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane did not respond to a request for comment on the policy order.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ibta S. Chowdhury ’25 met the news of Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s decision to step down next June largely with indifference.
“It’s kind of hard to make that connection to an administration that does not show itself as much or does not make itself seem as human,” Chowdhury said.
Bacow announced his departure after just five years in office in a Wednesday email to Harvard affiliates. During his tenure, Bacow oversaw the University’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the ramifications of Trump’s presidency on higher education. Students across the University reacted to the news of Bacow’s exit with a mixture of shock, ambivalence, and reflection.
Deven Hurt ’18, who now attends Harvard Law School, said Bacow’s term felt “quick” in comparison to his predecessor, Drew G. Faust.
“I was definitely surprised. I also did not have, initially, a great feel for how long University presidents traditionally served,” Hurt said. “When I was originally a student at the College, Drew Faust eventually finished her tenure after 11 years.”
Still, Hurt said he was ultimately “very happy” with Bacow’s presidency, citing his “phenomenal” handling of the pandemic.
Other students praised Bacow’s Covid-19 response, which included the decision to evacuate campus as the health crisis escalated — making Harvard one of the first schools to do so. The following year, the University opted for remote learning on a low-density campus.
“He had a really hard job dealing with Covid,” Soren E. Choi ’24 said. “I think there’s some pent-up frustration against him because of factors he couldn’t control, such as the pandemic.”
Choi said he believed Bacow “really cared about the students overall,” despite facing a challenging term shaped by the virus.
Nicholas R. Gjerde, a student in the Extension School, lauded Harvard and MIT’s decision to sue the Trump administration over a policy that restricted international students from residing in the United States if they were only taking online classes.
“I thought that was a really strong message,” Gjerde said.
During Bacow’s tenure, Harvard graduate students went on strike twice during contract negotiations with the University.
Denish K. Jaswal, an executive board member of Harvard's graduate student union, said while she initially was indifferent toward Bacow, she grew dismayed by the president’s “silence” toward her union’s demands.
“He literally wrote a dissertation about unions and still turned a blind eye towards any of the things that we were working on,” Jaswal said.
Victoria “Vicki” DiLorenzo, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School and a former member of the HGSU’s bargaining committee, said she hoped the next administration would be “more supportive” of the union.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on Bacow’s interactions with the union.
At the College, many students reacted to the news of Bacow’s departure with apathy.
Brammy Rajakumar ’23 said she was surprised that Bacow decided to step down “in the middle of a pandemic” but otherwise felt “fairly neutral” about the news.
“People were just making jokes about it and just not being very interested,” said Rajakumar, a former Crimson editor. “There’s just so many other roles in the University that are just as equally important and serve students more directly.”
Bacow’s departure sparked a barrage of memes on Sidechat, a social media platform which allows Harvard students to anonymously create posts about Harvard life.
“larry bacowed out,” one anonymous student punned.
“Larry’s in his UC era,” another poster wrote, referencing the recent resignation of former Undergraduate Council President Michael Y. Cheng ’22.
Henry S. Bae ’25 said though the announcement was unexpected, he believes the general sentiment surrounding Bacow’s presidency was “somewhere in the middle.”
Hurt said he is “looking forward” to following Harvard’s search for Bacow’s successor and hopes the new president is responsive to student needs.
Still, DiLorenzo said she does not expect radical change under new leadership.
“I certainly hope that the next person is a person of color, a woman, or both,” DiLorenzo said. “But I don’t know that I am expecting something particularly transformative, just given the structures that they’re going to operate under.”
Correction: June 9, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Harvard Kennedy School student Victoria “Vicki” DiLorenzo is a member of the Harvard graduate student union’s bargaining committee. In fact, she formerly served on the committee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard’s presidential search committee goes to work in the coming months, it will have some competition.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who announced Wednesday that he plans to step down next year, has joined more than a half-dozen prominent higher education leaders who are set to depart soon, including the presidents of Dartmouth College, Columbia University, Tufts University, and MIT.
Many experts agree Covid-19 has played a role in spurring the departures, which will leave open many of higher education’s top jobs all at once.
“While you expect crises to come along, you don’t expect one that lasts two years — and that causes essentially the world to be affected in the way the pandemic did,” said former Missouri State University president Michael T. Nietzel. “This is of a whole different magnitude than would be normally expected.”
At least half of the Ivy League will see a presidential transition either this year or next. Dartmouth College’s Philip J. Hanlon and Columbia University’s Lee C. Bollinger both announced plans to depart in 2023, along with Bacow. Former University of Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann resigned in February to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Germany.
An array of local higher education leaders have also called it quits this year. MIT President L. Rafael Reif and Tufts President Anthony P. Monaco — who lead Harvard’s two closest neighbors — recently announced plans to depart at the end of the 2022 and 2023 academic years, respectively. The presidents of Amherst College, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and Emmanuel College have all also announced they will exit in the coming months.
L. Jay Lemons, president of the recruiting firm Academic Search, said an array of challenges — not just Covid-19 — may contribute to the mass exodus, pointing to state-level political headwinds some leaders face, among other issues.
“What might appear to be some clumping could be a bit a consequence of Covid, but is more likely a bit more complicated phenomenon than it may appear on the surface,” Lemons said.
Former Ohio University President Roderick J. McDavis, who leads the higher education executive search firm AGB Search, said the pandemic’s challenges may have caused leaders to depart earlier than originally anticipated.
“The last two years in higher education can be compared, really, to about three to five years in terms of the amount of stress that people have been under,” he said. “The fact that many of the presidents that probably had planned to serve a few more years have reached a point where they’re deciding to step down is very much a national trend.”
Some search firm executives said the pandemic may lead schools to prioritize crisis management skills when selecting new leaders.
Another potential factor in the wave of departures: age.
The American Council on Education, a leading education nonprofit, noted in its 2017 American College President Study that presidents were “slightly older” than their counterparts from five years ago. The report predicted higher turnover in top posts due to retirement and shorter tenures in the following years.
Bacow, 70, was tapped to serve as president of Harvard in December 2018 after previously serving as president of Tufts. Lemons called Bacow’s tenure at Harvard an “unexpected second act.”
In the first four years of his presidency, he steered the school through an array of crises — most notably, Covid-19 — and battled the virus twice himself.
Nietzel said broader shifts in higher education may have also influenced leaders, pointing to a growing erosion of trust in institutions — including universities.
“Major social institutions across the board have come under not just scrutiny, but face cynicism from a large segment of the public — and there’s been a particular aim at elite universities in that regard,” Nietzel said. “Harvard would be at the top of that list.”
“I think it does take a toll to defend universities against those kinds of attacks,” he said. “Understandably, presidents get tired.”
