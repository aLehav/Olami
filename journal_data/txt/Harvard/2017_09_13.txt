After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s no easy task to write apolitical political satire. That’s probably why Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk failed so miserably to produce anything worth watching in the season premiere of “American Horror Story: Cult,” which is set in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 presidential election. Now in its seventh season, “American Horror Story” has received generally positive responses from critics and casual TV watchers alike for its creative premises, engaging plotlines, and can’t-look-away grotesquerie. “Cult,” however, falls flat, in large part because of its co-creators’ refusal to explore the season’s subject matter in any meaningful way.
Ryan Murphy never intended for “Cult” to be, in his words, “pro-Hillary [or] anti-Donald Trump.” Though his intentions may have been to avoid letting the show devolve into partisan propaganda, the show’s half-baked political neutrality prevents it from offering nuanced observations or incisive commentary. For instance, while earlier seasons of “American Horror Story” brimmed with compelling and well-acted characters, “Cult” is populated entirely by insufferable caricatures. Murphy lampoons those on both sides of the political spectrum with a maddening ham-fistedness. On one side are the unhinged and vulgar Trump supporters, who shout racial slurs and victory-hump TV screens; on the other side are the snowflake liberals, who bemoan CNN’s lack of trigger warnings, burst frequently into affluent Caucasian tears, and brandish bottles of rosé at possibly hallucinated evil clowns.
The plot, too, is burdened with this ungainly mix of clumsiness and ineffectuality. The premiere primarily follows Ally Mayfair-Richards (Sarah Paulson), an anxiety-ridden Jill Stein voter who appears to be this season’s protagonist, as she experiences a rather boringly unidirectional descent into mental instability following Trump’s election. Despite the episode’s ever-present theme of fear and the politics thereof, it largely fails to explore, explicitly or obliquely, the very real fears faced by Americans in the wake of the current political climate. Instead, Murphy attempts to meet some kind of scare quota by peppering the episode with Ally’s phobias (blood, clowns, irregular clusters of holes) and hoping viewers share at least some of them.
The only real-life collective fear “Cult” comes close to capturing is the sense of mistrust and unreality that permeated election night and the months thereafter. In one scene, Ally makes commiserative small talk with a cashier only to see him don a Make America Great Again hat. This incident allows the viewer to understand the symbolic significance of Ally’s subsequent killer clown encounters: Where once there were friends, there are foes. In every corner lurks another person who believes the world would be better off without her. Truth be told, however, the cast of clowns is not necessary to convey Ally’s sense of post-election wariness and derealization. In fact, their presence––combined with Ally’s histrionics and an excessive number of semi-ironic dolly zooms––made the episode almost unbearably campy at times.
It’s never quite clear what “Cult” is trying to get across, what’s meant to be a joke and what’s meant to be scary. Evan Peters’ maniacal blue-haired Trump supporter character is a menacing bigot, but his bizarre antics (he covers his face with Cheeto powder to celebrate Trump’s victory) render him too ridiculous to be frightening yet too threatening to be funny. Billie Lourd is successfully unsettling as a snuff film-watching babysitter, but her character’s self-injurious tendencies and anxieties about reproductive justice are played in such a strangely flippant way that she lands in a bungling middle ground between seriousness and satire.
In the end, “Cult” comes off as a feeble and opportunistic attempt to maximize viewership on both sides of the aisle. Anyway, even if it had offered a more biting take on recent events, it’s unlikely that it could be any scarier than America’s current descent into a real-life horror story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Slavery effectively ended in 1865 with the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. The racism that built and sustained American race-based slavery did not vanish. Despite the legislative gains made during the Civil Rights Movement, the very racism that kept slavery alive for hundreds of years now manifests itself in modern institutions and ideologies. We see it in the discrepancies in treatment of minorities and white citizens by police officers, in pay inequalities on the basis of pigmentation, at the Charlottesville Unite the Right Rally, and veiled in many more ideologically-rooted mistreatments.
Such is the story of the continuing battle for equality. Women, the BGLTQ+ community, Muslims, immigrants, and other minority communities have witnessed legal gains since the founding of the United States. Nevertheless, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, xenophobia, and hatred for identities different from one’s own still exist. Minority groups have complicated histories in the United States, and while social equality progresses with legal protections, the legacy of struggle and inequality cannot evaporate upon the introduction of legal protections. Codified laws are only a first step to unraveling traditions of hate.
It’s easy to think that once legislation is enacted, divisive inequalities will be erased. Mass mobilization is an effective actor in creating legal change, as it pressures lawmakers. The gains made by Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement, Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers Movement, and the women’s suffrage movement were monumental in extending and protecting civil liberties. However, the fight does not end there.
While protests affect the acts of legislators, who are often isolated from the general population, they do not combat long-existing sentiments of hatred. Legislation is not a guarantee of liberation from societal subjugation. Freedom of religion is guaranteed under the First Amendment, yet Muslims continue to face widespread discrimination from fellow residents in the United States, and indeed even from the President of the United States.
People with minority identities deserve more than solely legal protections. They, like all other people, deserve to live without fear of discrimination from anyone. Social equality should be the law of the land; more so, it should dominate public sentiment. Nobody should be born into socially “disadvantageous” positions kept alive by archaic, bigoted belief. More often than not, these conditions are socially, not legally constructed.
Despite major movements and gains in civil rights legislations for minorities, people of color are still subjected to more severe sentences in prison than their white counterparts, women are still consistently compensated less than men, and suicide rates are still much higher among the BGLTQ+ community than in cisgender and heterosexual communities. These are facts that cannot be contested, and they are direct results of American historical white, cisgender, male, heteronormative domination.
In addition to fighting for legislative gains, we must also fight to change the hearts of those around us. Those with privileged identities need to remember that identities cannot be compartmentalized: Discrimination against one is discrimination against all because of the inherent intersectionality within personhood. We need to leverage the privileges that we have, we need to check them, and we need to check the privilege of those around us to create real change. No longer can people with a privileged identity sit by idly, complicit in societal oppression, as others struggle.
We need to create a dialogue, create exposure to minority identities so that those in positions of privilege see that politicized social issues are human issues. Struggles involve a people’s humanity; they are not just theoretical issues that appear on the news. The combined force of dialogue and personal exposure with the rallying that drives political change can help shift ideologies and create true liberation.
The growing acceptance of the gay community during the 2000s is evidence of such ideological change. Where in 1973 approximately 70 percent of people believed same-sex relations to be wrong, by 2010, the rate dropped to 43.5 percent. There is still a long way to go, but increased exposure to gay people encourages and catalyzes the process of liberation for queer people from structural oppression.
Nelson Mandela once said, “No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion… People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.”
Real change does not exist in legislation alone. It must be accompanied by societal and ideological change. Laws may enumerate and codify legal rights, but without the disappearance of hate from personal ideology, people are not safe in society. They are not liberated from the social subjugation that was built from years, decades, or even centuries of marginalization and oppression.
Ideally, legislation would be synonymous with liberation. That, however, is a utopian ideal. As long as people hold incongruous views to legislation protecting the basic human rights of minorities, freedom cannot exist in full. Ideological change must accompany legal change. People must unlearn their hate and learn love.

Chris: We are told we are American, but what does it mean to be an American anymore? We pledge allegiance to the same flag, but each of us see a different vision projected by those stars and stripes.
As political polarization intensifies, the question of what it means to be an American continues to tear our communities apart as we battle to provide a better answer. America used to stand for freedom, or at least that is what we’re told, yet now we ban the very immigrants our monuments claim we pride ourselves in accepting into our communities. America used to be a safe haven from persecution, yet now it appears that we need a new haven to escape the persecutions of today’s America.
I grew up being told that immigrants like my family represented the American Dream. Yet as every day passes, the dream my family once held dear is increasingly drowned out by a sea of nativism being expressed by those who would rather see us oppressed if it meant the comfort of their supremacy could continue.
In my early childhood, we elected the first black president. The willingness of our country to elect a candidate who both embodied and projected positive change gave me hope for the future of our country. But we replaced him with the embodiment of what our country currently is—toxic and divisive. And as we continue to tear our communities apart, the question of what it means to be an American will continue to be in contention.
What I now recognize as the American Dream is a vision lost amid the hatred of our time. A vision lost because we have broken the fundamental pillar of our democracy: the willingness to listen to one another with respect.
Jason: By now it’s redundant to say that America is no longer up to business as usual. Some rejoice in this news with the hopeful anticipation that a chaotic administration will one day lead to a state where Washington, D.C. is no longer beholden to special interests instead of the people. However, for many, this is quite a frightening development that threatens our cherished and timed-tested political institutions, civic culture, and fundamental values as a people.
Both schools of thought have more than sufficient reason to either be concerned or optimistic for change. Yet somehow, these two sides have recently found a way to consistently talk past each other, not only blind to the merits of the opposing sides’ objectives but adamantly hostile in the same way one views an enemy in war.
In some ways, it is actually worse than that. In a war, the individual components have nothing against the people they are fighting against: They only take orders from bosses with conflicting strategic aims. As politics now devolves into a culture war, the two sides, before mere ideological parties, now view each other as intrinsically immoral and hostile.
This devolution of discourse exacerbates our divisions in race, class, and religion. Instead of exchanging ideas respectfully, we now fight to prevent what we believe is actual evil from succeeding. If we do not change the way we exchange ideas, only the loudest will succeed, either because they have ignited mobs to chant them in unison or because they are being shouted from the Oval Office. If we don’t approach one another with respect, but instead vilify each other merely because of our disagreements, we will feed the very evils we fear into existence.
Chris: We vilify one another not because our ideas are actually evil, but because we are never willing to actually listen to them. Instead of exposing ourselves to the possibility that perhaps there is a better position on an issue from our own, we continue to feed the divisiveness that is tearing our communities apart.
All we have to do is look at the most recent natural disasters we have experienced. In Houston, Tx., my family was amidst a sea of people who were willing to aid one another in their greatest time of need, not because they shared the same skin color, religion, or political party, but because they were all in the storm together. Our country is currently in the storm. The damage from which we will be forced to recuperate will leave scars too big for us to heal as individuals. It is time we realize that we are in this together and understand that the only way we truly heal individually is by healing as one nation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, professors from across the Boston area gathered in front of Johnston Gate for a rally. They then took to Mass. Ave. to be arrested as part of a civil disobedience demonstration. The professors made this bold decision in response to the repeal of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an executive order that grants undocumented students—who qualify and go through a background check—protection from deportation and a work permit.
We commend the professors and faculty members who stood up for students on this campus as well as the other undocumented individuals in this country. It was clear their act of civil disobedience may have been ignited by the repeal of DACA, but given the content of the speeches given at the rally, it was also about undocumented students without DACA and the immigrants across the country who are being targeted by the Trump administration.
It is also important to remember that the call to fight for the rights of undocumented immigrants is not limited only to students. It also includes workers, an indispensable part of Harvard, who are also impacted. Attention must be drawn to the 10.2 million undocumented people in this country who did not qualify for DACA but deserve to be protected regardless. The fight for equal rights at Harvard is not just about DACA. It’s about everyone.
We ask that no professors be penalized for participating in civil disobedience. Having to choose between activism for their students and their jobs should not be a concern that any would-be professor should have. Civil disobedience is a cornerstone of our democracy, and acts of support are important as the Trump administration continues scapegoating immigrants and their communities. We are especially impressed with Divinity School professor Ahmed Ragab, who was naturalized as a citizen one hour prior to being arrested in the name of the rights of his undocumented students and undocumented immigrants across the country. His actions epitomize the role protest plays in supporting our democracy.
Undocumented students, whether or not professors realize it, are an essential part of this campus; we hope that the professors who have shown this through their protest will inspire other professors, as well as members of Harvard’s administration, who may not be aware of the role that undocumented students play in their classroom to learn more about how to be better allies.
We also hope that these actions will result in faster institutional change, expanding the initiatives currently in progress and creating more support for all Harvard affiliates impacted by the President’s immigration policies. The University must ensure that these individuals feel supported at a time when the federal government seems to be doing everything in its power to undermine them.
It is more important now than ever that students and other Harvard affiliates who enjoy the privileges that citizenship provides leverage that in order to advocate in ways that may be too risky for undocumented students. Specifically, it is important for citizens not shy away from civil disobedience to push for change; it will become even more unsafe for those without the protection of citizenship to fight for their own rights. Members of our community, and this country, who are being impacted by these nearsighted immigration policies deserve to be fought for. The time to act is now.

Calling Carla D. Martin ’03 a ‘chocoholic’ is a bit of an understatement. Martin, a lecturer in the Department of African and African American Studies and the Executive Director of the Fine Cacao and Chocolate Institute, has dedicated her life to studying all things chocolate, from the culture of cultivating cocoa beans to the politics of picking a chocolate bar off the supermarket shelf. Martin’s work for the FCCI has taken her all over the world to create common understanding among global chocolate distributors, teach cacao growers how to better evaluate their products, and promote collaboration between producers and consumers in the chocolate market.  Editor’s Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: When did you realize that chocolate was the subject area that you wanted to study?
CM: I lived in West Africa for a period of about three years over time when I was doing dissertation research. I was living in a small archipelago called Cape Verde, and the family that I came to consider my Cape Verdean family had had family members who were indentured by the Portuguese government under colonialism. They were sent to work on cacao and sugar plantations in Sao Tome, another small group of islands off the coast of west central Africa. As I looked into this, I learned that many of them had lost touch with their family members, and in fact, they had been working in conditions of slavery up until 1962. I was shocked to learn that that had been going on for that long. I thought to myself: how is it possible that chocolate, this thing that I’ve always wanted, this luxury that I had always been able to enjoy, has such a problematic labor condition of production and that so many of us are unaware of that?
FM: How do the classes you teach at Harvard and the work you do for the Fine Cacao and Chocolate Institute inform each other?
CM: What I’ve found is that all of my academic work has set me up to be effective as the leader of a non-profit organization. There is always overlap in what I end up doing. I’ve especially found that it actually improves what I’m able to do with students when I come back into the Harvard classroom. I’ve taught this chocolate class, for example, for about five years, and there were times last spring semester when I thought to myself: how is it possible that I’ve taught this before when I’ve only learned what I’m saying now over the last six months? It’s constantly keeping me fresh, and it’s constantly updating my knowledge and enriching what I’m able to do with students.
FM: You also have a large public following on social media. Have there been times when you felt your online presence has made a big difference in the world of chocolate?
CM: There have been a variety of different scandals in the chocolate world over the past several years. Whenever a new report comes out about, say, child labor in cacao production (which is very popularized by the media), I’m able to have a real, immediate impact in terms of how people interpret and understand that report on Twitter. Although, what I will add is that it comes with some negative sides. I have had various neo-conservative groups attack my work via social media or via email in creepy ways. They write in and they say, ‘you’re trying to ruin M&Ms for everyone!’
FM: How much of your work deals with the production of chocolate, and how much deals with the end product?
CM: Because I work in the field of anthropology, my work is very holistic, so I’m really trying to see all of these different levels of production and consumption and how they connect with one another. What I find most useful—especially through the social engagement that I do with the nonprofit organization—is that I try to make decisions from the ground-up. And typically, the way that we as North Americans view chocolate is from the top-down, because we’re at the end stage of the supply chain. We have very little connection to the producers who make those raw materials without which chocolate wouldn’t exist.
FM: Has tasting the best chocolate in the entire world essentially ruined Tootsie Rolls and Snickers Bars for you?
CM: [Laughter] I was raised by a couple of hippies, and I was not allowed to have a lot of sweets. For me, any time I was bribed, I was bribed with candy because people knew I never got to have any. So, to this day, I love Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, M&Ms, Hershey’s Kisses... I will never turn those down. I think that it’s important that we understand them as a category of chocolate that’s available to us. Hershey’s Kisses are eleven percent cocoa content. The rest is sugar and milk and milk fat. But, I’m aware of the fact that when I have a Hershey’s Kiss, it’s nostalgic for me and has a very particular flavor profile. I think about childhood.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than two dozen Law School students staged a sit in outside offices where students were interviewing for positions in the U.S. military Tuesday in protest of President Donald Trump’s announcement that transgender people may not serve in the military.
The protest, organized by HLS Lambda and Queer/Trans People of Color, took place over the course of the day as the U.S. Army and Air Force conducted interviews for their JAG corps, which allows students to serve in the military while completing their legal education.
Because of Trump’s decision to ban transgender people from the armed forces, some students argued that allowing the military to recruit on campus violates the Law School’s anti-discrimination policy. Harvard receives hundreds of millions of dollars in research funding from the federal government every year, meaning it must allow the military to recruit on campus or risk losing its funding under federal law.
Han Park, the co-President of Lambda, the school’s BGLTQ student group, said that the groups leading the sit-in wanted to bring public attention to the issue.
“We’ve had a dialogue with the school and said, ‘Listen, if you’re going to have an anti-discrimination policy in place, live up to it, or else don’t take the money, or do something else with the money,’” Park said. “That’s the conversation we’re going to be having, but we’re today, right outside the interview rooms, just to kind of show a physical presence saying that we don’t agree with this policy.”
In an email to students on Friday, Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 acknowledged that allowing military recruiting on campus was in violation of the school’s anti-discrimination policies. Still, he said the Law School cannot bar the military from conducting interviews because of the Solomon Amendment, which requires federally-funded universities to allow military recruiting on campus.
“I very much regret this exception to our antidiscrimination policy,” Manning wrote. “Military service is a noble calling. Those who choose that path are entitled to gratitude and honor for the sacrifices they make protecting our freedoms. This fact, however, heightens the inequity and wrong of denying some of our students the opportunities that others enjoy to serve this country.”
He said that while the Law School itself receives very little federal support, federal funding constitutes 12 percent of Harvard’s overall budget.
Students in HLS Lambda and QTPOC met with Manning Tuesday to discuss the possibility of establishing an BGLTQ legal clinic at the Law School. Park said the groups have been pushing for the creation of such a clinic for a long time.
“It’s been years and nothing has been done, so we’re trying to use this leverage to say ‘it’s fine if you take the money, but lets funnel some of the money to direct work on the trans community and queer people of color in this community,’” Park said. “We’re looking to, hopefully if he is up for it, to have a discussion about what that would look like.”
This was not the first time Law School students have protested the military’s policies around BGLTQ inclusion. In 2005, students protested the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, eventually leading Harvard to file a brief in a Supreme Court case to strike down the Solomon Amendment.

Aiming to support more students from lower-income backgrounds—and aided by a $12.5 million donation—Harvard Business School will launch several scholarships targeted at first-generation college students, the school announced Monday.
The gift, from Jonathan S. Lavine and Jeannie B. Lavine ’88, is the largest-ever donation to the Business School for scholarships. The Lavine-endowed fellowships will be specifically directed towards students who were the first in their family to attend college and may not otherwise be able to afford the Business School’s nearly $107,000 annual price tag.
Under 10 percent of Business School students are first-generation college students, according to Chad Losee, Managing Director of MBA Admissions and Financial Aid. According to a survey conducted by The Crimson, more than 16 percent of the College’s Class of 2021 are the first in their families to attend college.
The Business School also announced in July that it will launch the Forward Fellowship, a scholarship program that aims to assist students who come from low-income backgrounds. Losee said these students often continue to provide financial support to their families throughout graduate school.
“They may be sending money back. They may be helping a sibling through a tough time, or a parent who’s going through an illness,” Losee said. “It’s our way of helping them meet the financial obligations that they have, but also recognizing how far they’ve come to get to our graduate business school.”
Both the Forward Fellowship and the two Lavine-endowed scholarship programs mark a departure from the school’s traditional financial aid system, which parcels out scholarships based on only individual need, not family and educational history.
The Forward Fellowship will begin for next year’s entering cohort, the Business School's Class of 2020. Losee said he estimates five to 15 students will receive the fellowship in its initial year. Recipients will be selected based on an application, which includes family information and an essay. Awards will range from $10,000 to $20,000 for each year a student applies and will supplement regular need-based financial aid.
“There are people out there who are nervous about taking time off their career…and making an investment in your future,” Losee said. “It’s a big decision to make...Financial aid is here to help people from all different walks of life, no matter their economic background or where they grew up or anything like that, feel like HBS is a place they can come to.”

As Harvard reckons with its historical ties to slavery, an exhibit at the School of Public Health this semester aims to honor the overlooked contributions of significant black and Native American figures in the field.
The “Ghost Portraits” installation consists of eight portraits featuring African-American and Native American pioneers, including five women, in public health and medicine. Printed on translucent fabric in black and white, they hang in the Kresge Atrium alongside color portraits of 14 of the Public Health School’s founders and deans, all depicting white men.
Noting students of color comprise roughly a third of the School of Public Health, Lisa J. Rosowsky ’87—a professor at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design who curated the portraits—said she wanted to see that diversity represented on the school’s walls. 
“Just looking around I can see that [the portraits] didn’t reflect the current population of the students,” Rosowsky said. “The first thing I wanted to do was to disrupt that gaze of all those white men kind of looking down students, staff, and faculty on that very commonly used space.”
The exhibit was commissioned and opened last May as part of a Public Health School conference entitled “Slavery & Public Health: Past, Present, and Future.” Initially set to close in October, the exhibit will stay up until the end of the fall semester due to an overwhelmingly positive response, according to Zennon R. Black, an administrator in the school’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.
The “Ghost Portraits” display comes as the University moves to acknowledge the history of slavery and its impact on Harvard. Last week, Harvard Law School unveiled a monument to the slaves owned by the Royall family, who endowed the institution. In April 2016, University President Drew G. Faust dedicated a plaque to four slaves who worked and lived on campus in the 18th century.
Rosowsky said that she spent a month researching the history of public health and compiling a large list of candidates for the portrait series, then another month searching for portraits of the individuals in national archives and local historical societies.
“Many of the people who made the final cut were ‘first ofs’— one was the first Native American to go to medical school, for example,” she said. “Each of these individuals had some significant contribution to public health.”
After the fall semester, the exhibit will be replaced by a portrait display of current Public Health School staff and faculty to “reflect the changing community,” Black said.
“I think this installation has begun to allow students, whether they identify as African American, Native American or not, to now see themselves succeeding as leaders in the field of public health,” Black said.

UPDATED: September 13, 2017 at 4:35 p.m.
Around a dozen undergraduate women auditioned for the Hasty Pudding Theatricals this weekend, continuing a three-year and so far unsuccessful push to pressure the all-male production to add women to its cast.
Some of the women had auditioned for the cast of the Pudding—a campus drag troupe famous for its burlesque productions and celebrity “roasts”—multiple times in the past, but, as in previous years, they did not receive a callback.
“Unfortunately, the gender composition of the Hasty Pudding cast will remain the same for HPT 170,” the Hasty Pudding Theatricals executive board wrote in an email to the women auditionees obtained by The Crimson. “We would like you to know that we really value your effort to make change within the Harvard arts community.” 
Calls to change the Hasty Pudding’s long-standing all-male cast first made waves in 2015 when a group of undergraduate women signed up for auditions in protest. The troupe’s website notes that “while the Pudding remains all-male on stage, we have female members who have been working on every other facet of the show since the 1950's.” Women are allowed to be involved behind the scenes as part of the business staff, band, creative team, or tech crew, but cannot take the stage as a cast member.
Last September, at least 86 Hasty Pudding alumni signed a petition advocating that the third-oldest theatre organization in the world include women in its cast after over a dozen auditioned for the second year in a row.
Several of the women who auditioned this year said that participating in the Hasty Pudding Theatricals show can open doors for aspiring actors.
“It is so unfair that the men in the Pudding get all these opportunities to be in a professionally directed, orchestrated, choreographed show with professionally designed costumes and an extravagant set,” said Elizabeth P. Kantor ’18, who auditioned for the Pudding cast for a third time this year. “They are constantly performing and doing what they love, and women I know who are just as talented don’t have the same opportunity.”
Madison E. Deming ’18, who has also auditioned three times, agreed. “For people who are interested in musical theater and comedy, the best opportunity, professionally, and the most connections you can make on campus, is the Hasty Pudding,” she said.
Elle L. Shaheen ’21, who tried out for the cast this year, said that although she felt welcome at the auditions, it was “frustrating” to receive the email indicating that women would not be called back.
“For the first time I felt that I couldn’t do something because of my gender, which I did not expect to happen, especially on a college campus like Harvard’s,” Shaheen said.
Members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals executive board did not respond to requests for comment.
Deming said that she continues to encourage women to audition to send a message to the Hasty Pudding’s graduate board.
“We sign up, and take up a lot of their space, purposefully, because we want to make a point—especially to the grad board,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three former White House chiefs of staff discussed the challenges associated with managing White House staff, the unique partnership between the President and his top adviser, and disorganization in the Trump White House at the Institute of Politics Tuesday night.
The panel included Denis R. McDonough, Andrew H. Card Jr., and Thomas F. “Mack” McLarty III, chiefs of staff to former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, respectively, and was moderated by Chris Whipple, author of the New York Times best-selling book The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency.
Whipple began the event by asking the speakers to describe their job for the audience but soon transitioned to a discussion of the Trump administration, beginning with the “doomed” tenure of President Donald Trump’s first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, who left the White House in July after just six months.
“The responsibility of the chief of staff is such that you have to have a unique relationship with the President to do your job, and you have to be empowered by the President to do the job,” Card said, who added that Trump did not support Priebus in this way.
Card said it was difficult for Priebus to “introduce discipline to the White House when the President wasn’t practicing any discipline himself.”
Whipple then turned to the current state of the Trump administration, posing the question of effective governance under circumstances far outside the norm.
“This is a big challenge for the country,” McDonough replied. “There is very little muscle memory in Congress on how to get things done. They just forget how to do big, hard things.”
McLarty contrasted President Trump’s failure to enact his agenda with President Clinton’s early success.
“Good policy is generally good politics, and it certainly served President Clinton well that first year,” McLarty said.
Whipple also raised the preponderance of leaks coming out of the Trump Administration, asking the panelists how they managed to keep information inside the White House.
“People need to feel comfortable vetting their frustrations inside the White House instead of taking them outside,” Card said. “It eventually comes down to respect for your colleagues.”
McLarty said that in his tenure, he emphasized “the importance of staying focused on what we’re trying to do in the White House and not on scandal.”
In an interview after the event, Card said he encouraged Harvard students to get involved in politics instead of revelling in their cynicism.
“This administration is unprecedented in some ways in its contempt for Democratic institutions, in its assault on the judiciary, on the press, but the answer to that is to defend Democratic institutions,” Card said. “You have to get involved, you have to vote, you can’t opt out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This fall, some students found a welcome surprise when they opened their advising reports: “Sciences of the Physical Universe,” the General Education requirement traditionally satisfied by courses like SPU 12: “Natural Disasters” and Astronomy 2: “Celestial Navigation,” was suddenly fulfilled by introductory statistics and computer science courses.
This change in the categorization of some classes—which allowed students who had previously enrolled in massive lecture courses like Computer Science 50 “Introduction to Computer Science I” or Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods” to satisfy their SPU requirement—is the byproduct of a transition to a new General Education system set to take full effect in the fall of 2018.
“I think most [students] are extremely pleased and finding out ‘Oh, look, I fulfilled a few more than I realized I did,’” said Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Stephanie H. Kenen. 
Approved in March 2016, the new Gen Ed program mandates that students take four courses in newly defined Gen Ed categories, as well as three distribution requirements across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and a “quantitative facility” course. The Faculty voted to overhaul the program after a 2015 FAS report deemed that the current Gen Ed system was “failing on a variety of fronts.”
According to Kenan, the General Education program has adopted a hybrid approach in which General Education courses can be fulfilled through both old and new requirements. Students have benefitted from this ambiguity, finding that some courses that did not previously fulfill General Education requirements suddenly did.
“The flexibility is the trade off for the uncertainty,” she said. “[Computer Science 50] doesn't actually fulfill SPU. It will fulfill the Science distribution requirement and there's no place to track that now. So basically, the spirit of the new requirement is being fitted into the old requirements.”
Harvard has also extended the more generous fulfillment standards to the College's Class of 2018, who will not be affected by the future policy. The Registrar’s Office is currently on track to fully transfer to the new General Education system for the 2018-2019 school year.
Students aren’t the only ones caught in Gen Ed limbo—professors, too, must prepare for the switch. Science of Living Systems 20: “Psychological Science,” for instance, which currently is a Gen Ed course, may have to move into the psychology department as “introductory psychology,” according to Kenen.
Fiery A. Cushman, who teaches PSY 15:  “Social Psychology,” which currently counts towards Science of Living Systems as well, said that roughly one third of polled students in his class indicated they wouldn’t have taken the course if it didn’t count toward Gen Ed. Still, Cushman said he doesn’t plan on modifying his course to fit the new Gen Ed categories.
“If it turns out the content fulfills a Gen Ed requirement, I’m going to be delighted,” he said. “If it turns out that it doesn’t, I’ll keep teaching Intro to Social Psych.”
Dean of the Arts and Humanities Robin Kelsey said that he hopes the new Gen Ed program will make it clearer to students why certain classes are classified as Gen Ed.
“I think the program is moving in an exciting direction,” Kelsey said. “The emphasis on unsettling the assumptions that students come to Harvard with is a good way to distinguish that program.”
Despite the approaching transition, questions remain about one aspect of the new General Education system. After substantial opposition from professors last spring, the Faculty have yet to approve a “quantitative facility” requirement, which would replace the current Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning requirement.
“We will be implementing and interpreting a broad set of requirements for fulfilling that requirement until there is a replacement,” Kenen said. “As it is now we are accepting all Mathematics courses, all Statistics courses and all Computer Science courses.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s chapter of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority could shut down if the College goes through with its sanctions penalizing members in single-gender social groups, one of several possibilities the group is considering.
The group has not come to a decision on the matter yet, according to Sally C. Marsh ’18, president of Kappa’s Harvard chapter.
“We are keeping all options open, and look forward to reading and responding to the final University policy on [single-gender social groups] sometime this fall,” Marsh wrote in an emailed statement.
The College’s policy—in effect for the Class of 2021—bars members of final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, athletic captaincies, and College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
The future of that policy remains uncertain, however, as administrators consider changing or even strengthening the current policy. A committee tasked with reviewing the penalties will make its final recommendations later this month.
The possible conclusion of the chapter would make Kappa—a sorority established off campus in 2003—the first of Harvard’s 23 unrecognized social groups to shutter operations following the announcement of the College’s historic sanctions in May 2016.
Critics have long argued that the penalties unfairly target all-female groups. Days after the announcement of the policy, hundreds of women rallied in support of all-female organizations like Kappa.
In March 2017, former associate dean of students David R. Friedrich clarified that the policy would allow traditionally all-female final clubs and sororities to retain their “gender focus” for the next few years. Friedrich added that the gender-focused mission should exist simultaneously with “substantive move toward full inclusion,” including gender inclusivity.
But unlike final clubs, the bylaws of national Greek organizations determine the membership policies of the Harvard groups, often mandating single gender membership.
Of Harvard’s original nine Greek organizations, two fraternities—Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kappa Sigma—have chosen to go co-ed and disaffiliated from their national organizations in the process.
In contrast, Kappa is working in close consultation with its national organization in light of the College’s penalties.
“We are proud to continue supporting our chapter at Harvard University as the University reviews its policies regarding single gender organizations,” Ashley Moyer, a spokesperson for the national Kappa Kappa Gamma organization, wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson. “We believe strongly in the positive impacts our chapter and other fraternal organizations have on members at Harvard and the university community.”
In the meantime, members of Kappa can only wait and see as the College’s penalties are finalized.
“Regardless of the final policy, we are committed to maintaining a network of support and female empowerment on this campus now and into the future,” Marsh wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than a dozen candidates for Cambridge City Council discussed how to make Cambridge housing more affordable at a debate hosted by the Harvard College Democrats Tuesday night.
Abigail N. Burke ’19, events director of the Harvard Democrats, said the club has historically voted to endorse candidates in running for City Council. On Thursday, members of the College Democrats will discuss candidates' platforms and vote to endorse three candidates and aid their campaigns.
Of the candidates running for the Council, six are current Councillors, contending for nine seats—the first time in decades that a race of this kind has occurred. Candidate backgrounds ranged from current Harvard student to alumni, recent residents to Cambridge born-and-raised, software engineers to lawyers, “activists-by-night” to long-time politicians, but all of them said Tuesday that they call Cambridge their home.
Candidates discussed issues of housing, education, environment, and diversity at the event. Housing prompted the most responses, with eleven of the fifteen attending candidates using their limited speaking time to voice their stand on the issue. Gwen Volmar focused specifically on the homelessness problem, while the other candidates rolled out ideas for affordable housing.
Affordable housing in Cambridge is further complicated by the lack of housing provided by universities' failure to meet the demand of graduate students, candidates said at the event. City Councillor Dennis J. Carlone said that the City Council is currently working on zoning plans that limiting university growth with MIT, regulations for graduate students dormitories, and creating job training programs for surrounding neighborhoods on campus.
“I see no reason why we’re not going to go to Harvard after this, we’re seeing the same thing.” Carlone said. “If you’re tax exempt, and you’re blessed with being tax exempt, as the oldest university in the country, you have the responsibility to do more.”
Every year, Harvard pays the city as part of the “in-lieu-of-taxes” program. The amount paid, however, is part of an ongoing dilemma between non-profit universities like Harvard and the city.
Burke said that the Democrats held the event because they wanted “for people in the Harvard community to engage with local politics.” Around forty students attended the two hour event.  Bearing fresh new faces at Harvard, freshmen Ajay V. Singh and Nirav R. Sookhai, said that they came to learn about the City Council and Board of Education races.
“Those [elections] are going to affect us the most, because it’s local politics,” Singh said. “Getting to know the candidates, being face to face, and seeing them respond to issues as students and as new members of the Cambridge community, that’s just really cool.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2014 complaint that spurred a federal investigation into the College’s compliance with Title IX cited all-male final clubs as “major site[s] of sexual violence,” raising the possibility that the government is studying the groups as it evaluates how Harvard responds to sexual assault.
A month after two then-undergraduates filed the complaint, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights opened an investigation—which is still ongoing—into the College’s method of dealing with sexual assault cases.
“By not monitoring the Final Clubs, the University is condoning a social space that contributes to alcohol-facilitated sexual violence against [women],” reads the complaint, obtained by The Crimson through a Freedom of Information Act request.
As the College grappled with the federal investigation and sought to combat sexual assault on campus, it also formulated a policy penalizing membership in single-gender social organizations with the goal of minimizing their influence on undergraduate social life. Starting with the Class of 2021, the College’s sanctions bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, varsity team captaincies, and certain fellowships.
As he prepared to roll out those penalties, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana held discussions with final club leaders behind closed doors, at times citing the Title IX investigation as one reason Harvard must seek to control student behavior at the clubs. During one meeting, Khurana repeatedly told attendees that the University risked losing federal funding if it did not act.
A spokesperson from the Department of Education declined to comment.
Khurana also declined to comment on what role the 2014 Title IX complaint played in the development of the College’s social group policy. Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday evening that the College does not have a copy of the complaint. Though originally arguing the policy would help combat sexual assault, administrators have more recently pointed to gender exclusivity as a rationale for the sanctions.
But Title IX expert Colby Bruno said she thinks Harvard may be aware of its contents anyway, given the federal investigation.
Bruno, who serves as senior legal counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center, explained that schools under investigation by the Office for Civil Rights can often deduce why they are being scrutinized based on questions asked by investigators.
“The school will know every single allegation that is charged against them,” she said.
The 38-page complaint was filed in late March 2014 by Emily M. Fox-Penner ’17, a former organizer for anti-sexual assault student group Our Harvard Can Do Better, and one student who has remained anonymous. It contains ten sections, one of which—titled “Hostile Social Spaces on Campus”—is exclusively devoted to Harvard’s final clubs.
Other sections argue Harvard did not adequately inform students of their rights under Title IX and that the University’s disciplinary process for sexual aggressors violates Title IX guidelines. The document also features testimonial from Harvard students who were sexually assaulted, though this testimonial was redacted from the version obtained by The Crimson.
A few months after the Office for Civil Rights opened its investigation, Harvard dramatically altered its procedure for handling cases of sexual assault. The University created a centralized investigatory office to examine the cases and instituted a lower burden of proof in sexual assault cases.
The complaint’s two-page section on final clubs argues the University is obligated to track and report sexual violence in the final clubs under the Clery Act, a 1990 federal law that requires colleges and universities that receive federal funding to publicly disclose crime statistics on or near their campuses. The Clery Act specifically states schools must monitor and record crimes occurring at “off-campus student organizations which are recognized by the institution.”
The final clubs—which are off-campus and independently owned—have not been recognized by Harvard since 1984, when the male clubs chose to disaffiliate from the University rather than accept women. Nonetheless, the complaint argues that final clubs deserve surveillance because they are “central” to student social life.
“Given the lack of alternative social spaces on campus, many students feel that they have no choice but to go to Final Clubs,” the complaint reads. “Therefore, Harvard has an obligation to address harassment and assault and to track identified patterns of sex discrimination within these locations.”
Harvard’s online Title IX resource guide asserts the University’s sexual and gender-based harassment policy applies to all misconduct committed by students, faculty, or staff—whether the misconduct occurs on or off Harvard property.
In addition to calling for University oversight of the final clubs, the complaint critiques the social groups for holding “sexist” and “racist” parties and for reinforcing the idea that “women are there” to gratify men. The document takes particular issue with the way clubs select students to attend their weekend parties.
In a subsection titled “Predatory Social Spaces,” Fox-Penner and the anonymous student describe what they call a typical weekend night at the clubs, with club members acting as bouncers and turning away would-be partygoers “based on their appearance.”
“Admittance to these parties is contingent on a particular dress code that is revealing and objectifying of women and subject to the whims of the club members,” the complaint reads. “The effects of this standard resonate throughout campus.”
The 2014 complaint is not the only time Harvard undergraduates have taken the University to task for its management of sexual assault cases. In February 2016, Alyssa R. Leader ’15 sued Harvard, charging the school violated Title IX when it responded to a sexual assault complaint she filed. That lawsuit is ongoing.

Collegiate sailing is an elusive sport. While water polo and swimming find comfort in a heated pool, the Harvard sailing team braves the cold and unforgiving outdoor waters. The team must embrace the elements, for the wind and water determine whether they will succeed—or fail.
"We are excited for a great season on the water," junior Divya Arya said.
This institutional diaspora must confront earth’s most uncontrollable feature—the weather. Athletics often entails the training of one’s own abilities and then the integration of those repetitions to hone on near-perfect form for game situations. An athlete’s effectiveness is very often correlated to personal factors such as conditioning and physicality.
This fluid process from practice to competition does not work so simply for Harvard’s sailors. Training is focused on attempting to control the uncontrollable.
“You’ve just have to go out there, stand up in your boat and look upwind and survey everything,” junior Nick DiGiovanni said. “There are so many different factors that can contribute to it. There can be current, and there can be different pressures in the wind. There can be things blocking the wind. Like, in Boston, you can have buildings that are messing with stuff.”
As the sailors go out to practice every day, they learn to break down the conditions and find the most favorable path forward. Once the team is on the waters, they are essentially on their own without coaches to guide them.
“It’s just a fourteen foot boat,” DiGiovanni said. “So you’ve only got two people in each boat…. You’ve got the skipper and the crew in one boat. You’ve just got to talk together and map out a plan.”
This fall semester the team will collectively participate in 34 different regattas. With the team spreading across multiple locations each weekend, the collective success of the team rests on individual leadership. The fall season is especially focused on gaining sea legs as the team builds up its fleet, racing across two different divisions. Often one pair is on land while the other pair is out racing.
But at the end, there is still a distinct team component, which serves both as an accountability measure and support system.
“It’s still a team thing at the end of the day because you are always combining your scores with your teammates in the other division,” DiGiovanni said. “At the end, it all sort of adds up together and then you get the rankings overall.”
This dynamic will play out as the team gets further into the season and as they look towards the spring playoff season. This plays out most of all for the new sailors joining the Harvard team, who may have good individual success, but less experience competing as a group.
“We have a lot of depth now, a lot of new young kids,” said DiGiovanni. “They have a ton of talent and they are coming off of some really good high school racing.”
These new recruits will go through a unique development process of practicing as a team, but competing almost as individuals. As they compete across New England, they will encounter road bumps—or waves—but will also enjoy the opportunity to mature. As the season begins and the sailors disperse to their various regattas, they hope their competitions will collectively lead to team success in the spring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The next five days for the Harvard women’s soccer team will perhaps be a test of two things: endurance and the ability to fine-tune.
Can the Crimson squad, sitting on a 4-2 record for the year, pull through a grueling stretch of three games in five days while continuing to dutifully prepare for the quickly-approaching Ivy League conference play?
The tests start Wednesday afternoon against Quinnipiac (4 PM, NSEN), as the Bobcats roll into Cambridge with a .500 winning percentage and a dangerous junior forward, Nadya Gill, who has already posted 12 points on the season. Harvard, coming off a 1-0 loss to Syracuse, will look to get back to its winning ways against the visitors before taking on Villanova and Seton Hall in quick succession later in the week.
On the other hand, Quinnipiac (3-3) has lost its last two games and has a minus-six goal differential on the season. The team out of Hamden, Conn., has also been outscored 7-3 in its last two defeats.
To make matters worse for the Bobcats, the Crimson is 3-0 all-time against Quinnipiac and is 19-8-6 at home since the start of the 2013 season. Harvard has been similarly successful at defending its home turf this season, blanking Boston College and Providence both by a score of 1-0.
Against a slightly reeling team, the Crimson, with a defense as successful as any, now has a relatively clear aim: to score more goals.
“I think it’s a good opportunity for us to be a little bit more dynamic and a little bit more clinical in some of our attacking play,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “We want to generate more offensive opportunities.”
In a season in which the Crimson has played brilliant lockdown defense—allowing just half a goal per game—the Harvard players know that the importance of creating and finishing attacking opportunities has grown significantly. The game plan is now to complement their strong backline performance with execution on the other side of the pitch.
“Keep doing what we’re doing, just keep playing soccer the way we have been,” said senior co-captain Marie Becker. “Capitalizing on the chances we create and be more effective in the final third.”
The Bobcats are certainly prone to being scored on—the team is capable of both putting up and giving up many goals in its high-scoring affairs. In its three losses this season, for example, Quinnipiac was scored on three, three, and four times.
The Bobcats have also scored 11 times in six games, so the threat to Harvard’s resilient defense certainly remains.
“They’re going to be a team that’s going to attack us,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “We have to try and make sure we can withstand that.”
Quinnipiac’s Gill leads her team to Jordan Field, with five goals—three of which have come in the last two games—and two assists on the season. The streaking third-year also leads the Bobcats with 17 shots.
Redshirt freshman Kelsey Goldring is second on the Bobcats with seven points, posting two goals and three assists. The Quinnipiac roster boasts two more players who have scored twice in this young season.
In comparison, junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi is the clear powerhouse of the Crimson offense yet has posted one fewer point than Goldring—six points on three goals and no assists. In addition, only two players—Mohammadi and freshman Murphy Agnew—have scored a goal for Harvard.
Despite not finding the back of the net, Harvard still played its most complete game on offense this past Sunday. It created plenty of chances against ACC foe Syracuse and racked up a season-high 11 shots. Mohammadi launched seven shots, while Agnew and fellow freshman attacker Lauren Raimondo added one and two shots, respectively.
In addition to adding to its offensive pressure, the Crimson players believe they’ll be able to mitigate Quinnipiac’s threats by continuing their strong defensive play on Wednesday. Harvard has posted four shutouts in six games and has only been scored on three times to date.
“We’ve played against good players in the past, and especially with a team effort, we can deal with anything,” Becker said.
Becker, a defender out of Kiel, Germany, played with Gill on the Boston Breakers Academy Program team over the summer and described her as “a very good player, no doubt.”
“There are no hard feelings coming out of the match,” the senior said. “But there are definitely no friendships in the match.”
After Wednesday afternoon, the Crimson travels to Villanova on September 15 and hardly has time to rest before traveling to Seton Hall on September 17.
When Harvard gets to Ivy League play, though, it’ll have more chances to breathe. A week separates most of the Crimson’s matchups against its Ancient Eight foes, starting with Penn on September 23.
