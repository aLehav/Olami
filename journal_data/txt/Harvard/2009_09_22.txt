After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, we saw the latest of a number of vocal protests of the layoffs of workers, but this time they had a new message. Through their actions and words, union activists argued that sanitation standards have suffered because fewer janitors now clean Harvard in less time due to layoffs and cuts in working hours. The new tactic rings false, as it flies in the face of Harvard’s actions to promote cleanliness over the first few weeks of school. It is admittedly difficult to tell whether Harvard has become more or less clean since the janitor cuts; there have not been any reliable metrics or significant outcry about this issue.  However, Harvard maintains that it is doing everything it can to keep the campus clean, especially with the threat of swine flu this fall, and its actions thus far have been impressive. Through countless hand sanitizers, instructions on keeping clean, and other proactive measures, the university has been making a concerted and visible effort to keep students and the campus clean over the first few weeks of school.  These efforts are necessary and will hopefully pay dividends if flu affects a large swath of campus later this fall. When labor groups attacks the university for its hygiene standards, they are making the mistake of criticizing a program that is both comprehensive and wise.In addition, the most important measures to avoid a massive disease outbreak this fall arguably won’t be janitorial measures, but rather decisions on personal hygiene and behavior. Washing hands before and after meals, keeping rooms clean, and doing laundry frequently will all help prevent a flu outbreak, as will healthful meals and proper amounts of sleep. The cleanliness of buildings is certainly important, but if students absolutely don’t want their peers to get sick this fall, they should encourage them to lead healthful and clean lifestyles. Harvard’s janitors are a valuable part of the university community, but Harvard’s decision to let some people go to manage costs during tough times was understandable and necessary. The efforts of those janitors remaining are admirable, and we encourage the union not to disparage both their efforts and those of the university as a whole by associating layoffs with decreased cleanliness. Harvard is making an earnest and thorough effort to keep students clean and healthy this fall, and, inevitably, much of the responsibility for the health of the College will fall to the students themselves.Correction included: A previous version of the article above incorrectly cited the Student Labor Action Movement as having organized and led the protest. In fact, it was put on by union officials. The Crimson regrets the error.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, behind-the-curtains activity by President Barack Obama garnered national attention when it was leaked that he had relayed a message to New York Governor David Paterson, requesting that Paterson quit seeking re-election. While this presidential vote of no confidence may seem particularly harsh, especially given that Paterson is a fellow Democrat and one of just two black governors nationwide, the ensuing reaction in the media has been seriously overblown.
Obama’s message was in no way out of line or unusual—presidential communication of this sort almost certainly occurs often: behind closed doors and without hype. He determined correctly, alongside his political advisors, that Paterson is particularly embattled—with 71 percent of New Yorkers assessing the governor’s work as either “fair” or “poor.” Paterson might not even survive a challenge in the Democratic gubernatorial primary and could very easily lose to a Republican challenger in the statewide race, especially if that challenger were to be former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, as some speculate.
Though from an Electoral College perspective, New York will almost certainly remain a Democratic state, the state has certainly elected Republican governors in the past and could certainly do so again. A Republican governor would put tremendous pressure on local Democratic leaders and the state legislature. Further, if Giuliani were elected governor of New York, he might pose a threat to President Obama’s own reelection bid in 2012. It is quite reasonable, then, for President Obama to communicate his concerns to Governor Paterson so as to avoid the many problems for the Democratic Party that an unsuccessful New York gubernatorial campaign could create.
Governor Paterson has refused to heed President Obama’s advice, however, and has committed to run for re-election anyway. He has every right to do this. Nevertheless, Governor Paterson’s refusal to the media to discuss his rationale behind neglecting Obama’s advice was not the best way to handle a very delicate situation. In deciding to run anyway, Paterson should have been more publicly deferential and respectful to the desires of the leader of the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, while his message was warranted, Obama might want to rethink the way he communicated it. Because President Obama campaigned so vigorously on a message of change, it is particularly off-putting to see him engaging in backroom deals that are more closely tied to old politics than to President Obama’s promised politics of the future.
That said, Democrats should not be totally disappointed in President Obama’s behind-the-scenes politicking because this means that at least someone is taking a definitive leadership role in a political party that has not always made the most savvy electoral decisions. President Obama must represent all of America, but he is wise to take an aggressive role in the positioning and organization of his party, not just at the nationwide level of government, but also at the state and local level.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, as I stood battling for my place in the always chaotic Quincy House lunch line, I ignored the “excuse me” calls flying about on all sides and focused on the various messages Harvard University Dining Services was sharing with me. Through table placards, video screens, and posted advisories, HUDS was doing everything it could to save me from getting H1N1 through nifty, cheerfully presented tips. Such tips, however, seem more intended to comfort their makers than they are to actually stop H1N1’s spread.
Swine flu is an unavoidable risk on campus, and I suppose remaining mindful can only improve one’s safety. Yet the number of advisories and preventive measures seem better suited for a game of “swine-flu dodging”—so let’s play. To win your first point, you have to make full use of the Purell dispenser by the entrance. I have overheard students comparing the dispenser to its counterparts in other Houses. “Lowell’s totally doesn’t work,” one student shared. One point, Quincy.
Upon entering the dining hall, notices warn students to use a clean plate each time one gets more food from the lines to avoid contamination. Too bad for those environmentally conscious friends trying to save resources and conserve water—in the game of swine-flu dodging, the Dudley Co-operative Society is surely at a disadvantage.
The game raises its stakes as you sit down to eat. According to tradition (invented right now), you have to dive for cover if someone sneezes in the beverage area. If this happens in the food line, for an extra point, a player can simply turn his head and no-look point to an H1N1 sign. The most difficult maneuver in the game, attempted and unconverted in one try so far, is to read HUDS’s on-table signs about swine-flu risks and then successfully mention “the crook of the elbow” in conversation unrelated to “places where you should safely sneeze.”
OK, fine—so HUDS probably had more in mind than promoting games like this when it made these advisories. Yet its messages aren’t good for much more. The advice they offer is confused and largely superficial. Suggestions that students wash their hands before eating are common sense and should be applied before every meal, not just during swine-flu season. The health messages it prints often seem to arise more out of a desire not be held liable than out of genuine concern. Nutrition fact placards disappeared when some people complained, for instance, but they later came back—sort of—in the form of printouts available somewhere in each dining hall. (Even The Crimson remains confused by HUDS’s quirky new plan for nutrition info.)
One can’t blame HUDS for trying, but what do such notices actually achieve? Tips like using a fresh plate for seconds do not seem particularly effective in a packed dining hall like Quincy’s. Anyone who has lunched there knows the basic crowd dynamic: Right after noon and 1 p.m. classes, the place is more like a battle scene out of “Gladiator” than a serving station. Then, in the middle of each hour, with no classes disgorging hungry, recently sleeping students, it quietly recovers while the tables strain under full capacity, random students brushing shoulders as groups compete for space.
Our crowded eating area itself seems the most likely way that disease would spread. Signs warning about things like plates seem laughably inadequate in this context. Follow these tips, they seem to claim, and one will be safe from danger. But if the student next to you fighting to reach the last pizza slice has H1N1, then you may be bound for UHS’s quarantine rooms, regardless of whether his plate is clean or whether he earned his point for Purell use.
Certainly, H1N1 is a serious risk—this is not to discount it as a threat. Those with pre-existing medical conditions are at a higher risk of danger than the average population, and unfortunately several students nationwide have died of complications. Advisory campaigns to supposedly minimize our risk, however, are ineffective. It’s common sense and the responsible self-reporting of symptoms that will protect us—not refusing to shake hands with people juggling clean plates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Steve is a fearless journalist,” stated James Hider, a Middle East correspondent for The New York Times, about his colleague at the newspaper, Stephen Farrell. A force of NATO commandos had just freed Farrell on September 9 after the Taliban kidnapped him and his translator in the Taliban-occupied Kunduz province of northern Afghanistan four days earlier. Yet four deaths in exchange for one reckless journalist’s story is an impossible transaction to defend. Journalists must exercise more caution in reporting from war-torn areas like Afghanistan. Their bravery can quickly turn into a vainglorious fixation on getting a story when others’ lives are also endangered. 
Farrell had been investigating a recent German-ordered air strike targeting two hijacked fuel tankers in Kunduz that killed 70 people, a number of them civilians. The region, however, was volatile and controlled by the Taliban. Despite police warnings, Farrell entered Kunduz without a military escort, armed with nothing more deadly than the language abilities of his translator. In the mission to save Farrell, a dual British-Irish citizen, four people were killed: a British commando in the NATO force, an Afghani man and woman—both civilians—and Farrell’s own translator, Sultan Munadi. When did reporters decide that they are CIA operatives? Certainly, undercover and investigative journalism has a long history, but generally such people have assumed all risks for themselves and themselves alone. Farrell, by shunning a military escort, made himself into a liability for NATO as well as for The New York Times, which did not report on the situation for fear of Taliban reprisal against its hostages. The Allied forces became responsible for rescuing Farrell from a situation into which he should have never put himself, much less put the life of his co-worker Munadi, a married man with two children who had worked as a translator for U.S. newspapers for many years. Farrell’s behavior could be excused if he only endangered himself in his quest to report on the air strike, but the situation in Kunduz made that impossible—a reality Farrell should have appreciated before basically throwing himself into the Taliban’s waiting arms. Reporters should write to expose others to the truth, not foolishly expose others to danger.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Upon entering the art gallery of the Government Museum in Chennai, visitors are greeted by enormous portraits of various officers, presumably painted in India. I say presumably because British artists painted the portraits in British style. The people portrayed in these works all wear British clothing. Probably because they’re British. Apart from a vaguely Indian script in the corner of one painting and a barely visible Indian servant in the background of another, there is no reference to India at all whatsoever in this section of the museum. 
The next portion of the exhibit consists largely of works by Raja Ravi Varma. A late 19th-century painter, Varma is easily the most famous artist in India. He used European techniques to illustrate Indian subject matter: various sari-clad women, figures from Hindu mythology, and scenes from everyday Indian life. 
In the summer of 2005, my parents and I traveled to India for one month to visit the host of grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins they’d left behind. At one point during the trip, a police officer asked us to pull over our car. My dad was fully prepared to bribe him, the modus operandi when dealing with any uniformed Indian. But our American accents were enough to promptly dismiss the official, after offering to provide us with any assistance we might need. I giggled smugly along with the rest of my family, but I pitied the policeman. I had always viewed my heritage as a burden because I grew up in a nation that was foreign to my parents. What an unpleasant surprise for my teenage self to find an entire country of people similarly stifled by their Indianness, even in their native land. 
Months after my return to the States, I encountered my first Varma painting while flipping through my high-school art-history textbook. (My class never got to the section on Indian art, which wasn’t covered on the AP Exam.) I would come to blame artists like Varma for the exaggerated deference I’d witnessed firsthand in India. In a country with such a rich artistic tradition, I found myself asking: What compelled a Keralite to adopt a European vocabulary to produce something meaningful and aesthetically pleasing?
The last section of the Government Museum consists of pieces from the past few years. Contemporary Indian artists have begun using archetypal Indian techniques in new and interesting ways. This trend is unsurprising in a nation whose potential growth rate is expected to average 8.4 percent until the year 2020, with a GDP set to surpass that of the United States by 2050. As the nation grows and develops economically, its people are discovering a newfound pride in their heritage. They needn’t look to the West for expressions of their modernized selves but can instead draw from their nation’s past. When Indians hear American accents in shopping malls and hotel bars, they no longer accommodate and kowtow. Instead, they ask how Americans are responding to the downturn after causing  worldwide economic collapse. My high-school self would certainly have been pleased. 
I returned to India this past summer, four years after my first, fleeting glance at a Varma painting, in a cliched attempt to reconnect with my roots. (The journey of self-discovery included a trip to the Government Museum.) At the same time, New York Times columnist and similarly second-generation immigrant Anand Giridharadas was completing a four-year tour of the country. Determined to steal my thunder, Giridharadas wrote about a transformation of the Indian population’s psyche. “They don’t crave our mayonnaise and khakis anymore... Indian accents are now cooler than British ones... How fortunate to live in a land you needn’t leave to become your fullest possible self.” How fortunate to possess a rich and vibrant culture, one whose allure fascinates yet eludes a generation of Indian-Americans who return to the land of their parents to remind them of a history they never truly knew. 
If I learned anything during this time in the motherland, it is that true cultural progress cannot be measured by a nation’s willingness to abandon Hellman’s and Gap. It’s perfectly reasonable for Indians to be proud of how far they’ve come, particularly in a third-world country that is emerging as a strong player in the global economy. Still, a retreat inward is not only fundamentally flawed, but also ultimately futile. (Exports of goods and services as a share of India’s economy have practically quadrupled in the past two decades.) What better triumph for Indians, what better act of empowerment, than to adopt the vocabulary of their oppressors to enhance and enrich their tradition?
India can’t go back to what it was before colonization. Arguments about whether the country would be better off today if globalization hadn’t been forcefully thrust upon it are ultimately pointless. The real show of strength for India is not, as I once believed, to pretend that Western influence doesn’t exist, but to incorporate that influence, as Varma did, into a distinctly Indian story. For the first time in modern history, the world is listening.

When “An Expensive Education”, a novel by Nick McDonell ’06-’07 came out this summer, Harvard was, once again, fictionalized and seen anew through the eyes of a recent graduate.
But while McDonell explained that his focus was on writing an engaging spy novel rather than on representing the setting where so much of the novel unfolds, a number of young authors who choose to write about Harvard instead decide to incorporate the institution into their own stories.
“Having a bad depression and getting help and medication happens all over the place, but the specifics are really important,” says Elizabeth Wurtzel, author of Prozac Nation, a memoir of her depression that began when she was eleven or twelve and unfolded throughout her undergraduate years. “I’m not sure if I would have been able to write the book and get it published if it didn’t take place at Harvard,” Wurtzel says. “People are always curious about the place.”
Although many such memoirs are not about Harvard per se, the name and place are tied inextricably to the stories, and the memoirists would argue they couldn’t be set anywhere else.
WHAT KIND OF 25-YEAR-OLD WRITES A MEMOIR?
“If you write a memoir, particularly at a young age, there has to be something unique about your experience,” says Ruben Navarrette Jr. ’89-’90, who arrived in the Yard as one of 35 Mexican Americans in the class of 1989, five years before the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies was founded.
Navarrette left Harvard when he was 23 and decided to write his memoir just one year after graduating. By the time he was 26, his book, “A Darker Shade of Crimson: Odyssey of a Harvard Chicano”, had been published. He described the writing process as “cathartic” and explained his decision to pen the memoir so soon out of college.
“The emotions coming out of college were still pretty raw,” says Navarrette, “It was a very effective way, I think, to transition out of college and into the workforce and into what became a career as writer and journalist.”
While Navarrette explored his ethnicity to cast a unique spin on the Harvard experience, Lauralee Summer ’98 also seized upon her unusual path to Harvard in writing her memoir.
When Summer was making a name for herself in high school wrestling, reporters started asking her about her family background. She talked about how growing up she and her mom sometimes lived in homeless shelters, moving 20 times before she was 12 years old. Soon, she was making headlines as “Homeless to Harvard.”
“A lot of people, I think, had the perception [that] if you work really hard, you could overcome poverty, and anyone could go from being homeless to Harvard, and therefore the American dream was awesome and working for everyone,” Summer says. And so, Summer, the first woman to join Harvard’s varsity wrestling team, decided that if anyone was going to tell her story, it should be her.
“I felt like I had had a lot of lucky events in my life and a lot of people who cared about me. That was part of the reason that I made it from one place to another. That was the story I really wanted to write.”
And she wanted to do it right away. “I felt like it would be a different story if I waited a long time,” she says, “I wanted to do it while it was fresh.” She first wrote “Learning Joy From Dogs Without Collars” as a creative thesis, and her adviser recommended the manuscript to a publisher.
Elizabeth L. Wurtzel ’89, the author of “Prozac Nation,” initially set about to write an article for New York Magazine in honor of the 350th anniversary of the University about what Harvard was really like. While the 20,000 word piece was never published, Wurtzel held onto her material along with notebooks she had kept to journal her thoughts. She then wrote an article about taking Prozac to beat depression, and eventually it became clear that her untold story of Harvard life was actually about being depressed.
Wurtzel conceived of her memoir idea when the form was much less popular than it is today. “Any memoirs were pretty much written by famous people,” she says. “I was encouraged to either turn it into a novel or make it more of a sociological study of depression in young people or something.”
The title ended up suggesting a more sociological account than the book actually presents, and readers expecting a cultural study of depression found instead a very personal account.
“It got a lot of nasty reviews and I think a lot of people did have this feeling of ‘What’s this privileged person doing complaining?’” she says. “Although I think I make this point in the book that that’s the thing about depression–it’s ridiculous. It’s about being sad about nothing.”
Along with many of the other Harvard memoirists, Aaron J. Greenspan ’04-’05 wrote a deeply personal account that ending up having a therapeutic effect for him.
Although he only printed a thousand copies of his memoir, “Authoritas: One Student’s Harvard Admissions and the Founding of the Facebook Era,” Greenspan says that the real value of the project was in the writing process. “It was either that or seeing a psychologist,” he says. “I didn’t want to be a nervous wreck for my entire life because of something that happened when I was in college.”
Greenspan’s memoir, which he began writing in August 2004, describes his personal history and unique college experience.
During his undergraduate years, Greenspan says he designed a web-based email system, a textbook exchange, and a course review tool for a statistics class. Eventually, he decided to combine his programs to make a web service he called houseSYSTEM. Greenspan tried to spread the word about this program, which included a universal directory called the Face Book (known also as the Universal Facebook and The Universal Face Book) that integrated all of the Harvard House facebooks.
Only a few hundred of the 1200-1300 people who were using houseSYSTEM started using the Face Book. One user, briefly, was fellow Harvard student Mark  E. Zuckerberg ’06-’07. By the time Greenspan was about to graduate–early, because he had opted to pursue Advanced Standing–he was reading about reports of Zuckerberg’s success with The Facebook.
Greenspan decided to explain his side of the story. While his friends were toiling over theses, he took on his own massive writing project and wrote a 333-page memoir of his life until graduation. Though he developed a computer program to contact every literary agent in America, he ultimately couldn’t find a publisher and self-published the book instead.
FIRST IMPRESSIONS
“There are several ways of approaching a big subject like Harvard,” writes Richard P. Bissell ’36 in “You Can Always Tell A Harvard Man.” “One is to take the subway cars from Park Street or South Station, getting a fine view of the Carter’s Ink sign as you cross over the Charles River bridge.”
Though Bissell was being clever, the opening of his 1962 book hits on a common element of the modern memoirs set at Harvard: focusing on the entrance.
Like all the memoirists FM talked to, Summer started the Harvard section of “Learning Joy From Dogs Without Collars” with Freshman Move-In. Summer, whose picture in the Freshman Directory showed her with fluorescent orange hair and a multicolored striped shirt and tie, brought friends from Quincy High School to help her move her things into Weld. She wrote: “‘Where do we park?’ Jeff asked. ‘Pahk the Cahr in the Hahvahd Yahd,’ Mary said, and we all giggled.”
Move-In Day is foreshadowing in “Prozac Nation.” The first Harvard chapter begins with Wurtzel’s mother chiding her for commenting that the rain on the drive to Boston “doesn’t bode well.” She hoped the change in environment would snap her daughter out of her depression. “But when we got to Matthews Hall on Saturday afternoon and discovered I lived on the fifth floor and there were no elevators,” Wurtzel wrote, “even she became a little less optimistic.”
Greenspan’s portrayal of his arrival is similarly ominous. “It was far too early in the morning, and the September air was brisk as we sped up Western Avenue,” he wrote at the opening of Chapter 11 of “Authoritas,” “I was reading printed directions off a bright red sheet of paper. Unlike most streets where you had to strain your eyes to read any addresses at all, the numbers here were larger than life, almost two feet tall and bold, so that they looked like they might hurt if they fell on you.”
The fear he reads into the large numbers suggests the unease that will underlie the rest of the events in his detailed account of the disappointments of his college career, which culminate in watching others get rich off of an idea he claimed he developed.
Consistent with the reflective but positive tone of “A Darker Shade of Crimson,” Navarrette is a more upbeat than Wurtzel or Greenspan, but he too describes his arrival in words laden with significance. He is preoccupied with the “Enter to Grow in Wisdom” inscription when his taxi pulls up to Johnston Gate. “As I walked awkwardly with too many bags and not enough hands through the darkness of Harvard Yard, the driver’s words echoed. Good luck. Odd.”
“I was, after all, merely going to college,” Navarrette writes, “As so many of my classmates from high school–60 percent of them, to be exact–were doing and as others had done for generations before me. Good luck? I didn’t need luck, I thought to myself. Public school or not, I was bad.”
INSIDE SCOOP
Characters in “An Expensive Education” are forever gazing up Annenburg’s spires, and McDonell name-checks Square restaurants and student organizations in his third novel. But beyond casual allusion is the more challenging task of describing things not obvious to anyone but those familiar with Harvard. Sometimes this means defining terms like concentration or TF with a jab at Harvard’s refusal to conform. Sometimes that means dispelling rumors.
As one can surmise from reading “Prozac Nation,” when Wurtzel attended Harvard in the ’80s, it was a different time. “The Adams House swimming pool was still open, and people just had orgies in there,” she says, “That’s not a myth.”
Although Keith A. Gessen ’97, the author of “All The Sad Young Literary Men,” is a novelist, the sentiments he conveys through his characters are indeed tied to his own feelings about his Harvard experience. In his 2008 novel, one of the things Gessen hoped to convey in a protagonist’s flashbacks to his days at Harvard was the letdown Gessen experienced when he realized the college of his dreams was not what he had imagined.
“I had a lot of ideas of what Harvard was going to be like, and that it was going to redeem all the time I had wasted getting into Harvard,” he says. “And then you get there, and it’s a lot of the same shit as the rest of the world. A lot of the same kind of class divisions, and a lot of people who just want to drink beer and go work at investment banks.”
Sometimes it is necessary to marshal less than scintillating aspects of Harvard life to hold retrospective weight. In “A Darker Shade of Crimson,” Navarrette wanders into the Yard earlier than his classmates, reporting for “a special work detail.” And in this special work detail, he writes, “a group of us would clean and ready the dormitory rooms of arriving undergraduates.” And like many other recorded events, Dorm Crew gets vested with symbolic and personal significance. “When asked of all Harvard taught me, I sometimes joke that my very first lesson was how to scrub a toilet. Appropriately so, perhaps.”
And if the dressed up term “special work detail” makes you laugh, Dorm Crew’s shout-out in “An Expensive Education” is imbued with a similar significance. While the elite are out swilling Bloody Marys for Sunday brunch at Deadalus, international students are swishing Mur-Kil down their shower drains. “The introductory meeting looked like an abbreviated European Union of reluctant janitors. A Scottish piano virtuoso, two Irishmen, half a dozen girls from Eastern Europe who were either short and stout like potato balls or tall and thin like dune grass on the Baltic,” McDonell writes. 
WITH FRIENDS LIKE THESE
But far stickier than explaining Harvard places and objects is the quandary of whether to use real names of people. Gessen’s titular sad young men represent what he describes as three guys who are each similar in different ways to the author.
“One of them is in the first person, and it just seemed natural to go ahead and call him Keith. And in a way, he’s the character who is least actually like me.” The roommate character is an amalgam of Gessen’s actual roommates. As for other central figures in the book, Gessen graduated two years ahead of Kristin Gore, but he insists that Lauren, the vice president’s daughter in the book, is not based on Gore, who he only knew “a tiny bit.”
For Greenspan, the decision to use only real names–no pseudonyms or composites– was difficult. “There were a lot of my friends who I wanted to include in the book who actually just aren’t in the book at all, because I wanted to write about them and they didn’t want to be tied up in the craziness that is my life,” he says.
Wurtzel’s friends may have even more reason to be scared. “On Halloween of my freshman year,” she wrote, “I found myself running through Harvard Yard because my best friend (at least so far), Ruby, was pursuing me and threatening to kill me, her pocket knife unsheathed, screaming something like, ‘you bitch, I’ll kill you.’”
Is Ruby real? And is she okay with having her knife-wielding chase immortalized in “Prozac Nation”? “It’s not her real name, but she’s a real person,” Wurtzel says. “And she’s actually, it’s amazing now, she has three kids and works in private equity. And she is nothing like she was in the book.”
In fact, the two stay in touch. “I adore her,” Wurtzel says.
UNIVERSALITY
Although the uniqueness of their experiences gives interest and profundity to their memoirs, paradoxically, many of the Harvard memoirists’ stories actually have universal appeal.
Just as Gessen characterizes his novel as one about the “disappointments of young men with the world,” — first, perhaps, with Harvard, and then with what they encounter next — so too do the trials Wurtzel and the others memoirists describe extend beyond the realm of Harvard.
After “A Darker Shade of Crimson” was published, Navarrette got a call from a retired doctor in Fresno, where Navarrette now works as a journalist. “He said, ‘When I was going through USC in the 1930’s, I was one of only a handful of Jewish kids. And so my experience of being Jewish at USC in the 1930’s,’ he said, ‘was exactly the same as you being Latino in Harvard in the 1980’s.’”


Sections
They expect to be fed, they soil themselves on the spot, they bite and scratch, and they’re found in dorm rooms across the Harvard campus. No, we’re not talking about high-maintenance students, we’re talking about their pets. Welcome to the secret, underground world of pets—and their quirky owners—at Harvard.
According to article two in the “Health and Safety” section of the 2009-10 Harvard Student Handbook, “no student may keep an animal in a building owned or leased by the College.” However, like many other regulations at Harvard, this one has been subject to loose interpretation by students. During the dead of night in rooms from the river to the quad, one can hear the tweets, squeaks, purrs, and ribbits of these furry intruders.  
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT
Throughout the Yard and various house courtyards, the sight of dogs jumping after Frisbees warrants no intervention from HUPD. These lucky canines are part of a select crowd belonging to tutors and House masters. House administrators, unlike students, do not have to abide by the pet rule. Despite the banishment of pets from student rooms, dogs have especially become common inhabitants of many entryways due to their popularity amongst House tutors.
“Tutor suites are a little larger than student suites,” said Winthrop tutor Brian J. McCammack. “The dogs fit fine.”
McCammack is the owner of two dogs, a Doxon named Tippy and a Basset Hound named Buddy, both of whom nest in his living room. Though McCammack says that though his students seem to enjoy the presence of the dogs, he generally keeps them tucked behind the safety of a baby gate. He also took the precautionary measures of making sure that none of his students had dog allergies.
Though McCarmmack has yet to punish any student for bringing animals into their dorms, he says he does not actively search for pets in students rooms.
FRANKLIN THE TURTLE 
Unlike many other undergrad pet owners, Collin P. Galster, ’11 speaks openly about his pet turtle, Franklin, who lives with him in his Eliot dorm room.  
“Yeah, it’s not fair that tutors have pets,” said Galster. “It’s not ideal, but to be honest, they give you enough leeway to have my pet turtle. There’s not enforcement for small things, so there’s a middle ground.” Galster admits that his House tutor is well aware of Franklin’s presence.
“In fact,” said Galster, “on Housing Day last year, I brought him [Franklin] down for luck. The House master’s wife fell in love with him. She thinks he’s adorable.” Galster clearly does not see the House administration as a looming threat. “Administration is not going to bother me. Franklin is not going to escape, and even if he does, he’s a turtle. How far can he get?” said Galster.
Turns out, Franklin has not only provided Galster with constant companionship, but also some social perks as well. Galster describes Franklin as a “chick magnet.” Their friendship goes so far that Galster has included Franklin in rowdy drinking games. “Franklin has had his share of Beiruit games,” said Galster, laughing.
ME OR THE HAMSTER?
Many other student pet owners are more secretive about their furry friends. A Kirkland sophomore was unwilling to release her name for this interview, fearing that her hamster Merf, short for Merfenevicha, would be taken away from her.
“It was love at first sight ...the connection is there,” said the pet owner, commenting on her first encounter with Merf, a Siberian Dwarf hamster she acquired as a result of “feeling lonely” during her stint in dorm crew earlier this summer.
Not all of the sophomore’s roommates have taken so warmly to Merf. Though she said she had informed her roommate about their extra roommate, apparently the forewarning was not sufficient for what was to come. The hamster has since become a sore subject for the two roommates, who constantly bicker over the presence of the pint-sized creature, according to Mertf’s owner.
“The hamster does not make any noise. It doesn’t smell. And yet, for some reason, my roommate has nightmares about the hamster jumping all over the bedroom,” says Merf’s owner. “If my roommate has no respect for my hamster, then she has no respect for me.”
Though Merf’s presence is of crucial importance to this student’s well being, she sometimes struggles to balance her two roles of Harvard student and pet owner. “The thing is with Merf, she gets lonely, she doesn’t have a companion to play with her. I’m busy with class, with work, and I don’t have the necessary time, which is on average an hour a day to play with her. I feel as though it is necessary that she get an article for herself,” says the student, “especially at a place as prestigious as Harvard, just so that she knows she is special.”
THE RAT PACK
In another River House, two students have been acquiring a growing family of rodents. “I mean, some dorms have mice running all over. One in a cage, one in a hall, what’s the difference?” asks one junior who preferred to remain anonymous, claiming that his House administration would hunt him down if they ever found out about his pets.
“I can understand their concern for large pets, dogs and cats, but for fish, turtles, hamsters, no reason to,” said this student’s girlfriend, who share what they consider joint custody of their two hamsters, Hammie and Marshmallow, and a rat they rescued from certain death at a Harvard lab.
The roommates of the rodent-loving student, however, were not as enthusiastic to find permanent crashers on their bookshelf. “They just came in. It was kind of [by] fiat, they just kind of brought them in, ” said one roommate.
“My roommate once stuck one down my pants, and both I and the hamster squealed,” commented the other roommate.
The couple denies that the pets are a distraction to schoolwork, claiming that various studies have shown that pets can actually have a soothing effect and helps to relieve stress built up through the day.
“[They’re] like YouTube videos. Are YouTube videos a distraction?” said the pet owner. “And having pets is therapeutic. If you have a rough day, you come back, you take the hamster out of the cage that is looking at you, and you pet it, and it’s fuzzy, it’s cute, and it overwhelms you.”

Nworah B. Ayogu ’10 will lead a predominately male group of senior class marshals, the Harvard Alumni Association announced yesterday.
Both Ayogu and Second Class Marshal Larry D. Arbuthnott ’10 said their primary goals as marshals are to promote class unity and to help seniors get to know each other during their final year as undergraduates.
The eight class marshals are responsible for planning senior class activities, helping pick the Class Day speaker, and organizing future alumni events.
Ayogu said he is particularly looking forward to the opportunity to help select the Class Day speaker.
“I’m not going to lie, Michelle Obama would be nice,” Ayogu said. “Barack would be a close second.”
A neurobiology concentrator in Currier House, Ayogu said he was “humbled and confused” by his selection as First Marshal.
“There definitely were people in the top 16 I would have picked over me,” he said.
Ayogu said he was at the T station waiting to take the train to lab when a friend gave him a high five. He said he thought his friend was celebrating the arrival of the Ashmont train until the friend congratulated him for being selected First Class Marshal.
Joining Ayogu and Arbuthnott as the Class of 2010’s representatives are Shiv M. Gaglani ’10, Jamison A. Hill ’10, Ami A. Nash ’10, Robert B. Niles ’10, Andres Castro Samayoa ’10, and George A. Thampy ’10.
Thampy said he looks forward to working with a group of students “who come with a stamp of approval from hundreds of people who say, ‘we know you, and we trust you.’”
Ayogu and Arbuthnott said that they were thrilled by the group of marshals selected, though both added that they wished the group better reflected the gender makeup of their class.
This year, 17 class marshal finalists were selected as opposed to 16 in past years, a change which raised speculation among several students that a technical error had led to an additional student being placed among the finalists.
The Alumni Association has not provided a reason for the change in numbers, and senior class coordinator Alexandra Monti could not be reached by The Crimson.
In addition to the eight elected marshals, the Senior Class Committee also includes representatives from each House. 
Applications for House representative are due to the Alumni Association tomorrow, and elections will begin on Friday.

A “neighborhood” is forming on Dunster Street. That’s what Robin Mount, interim director of the Office of Career Services, is calling the organization’s newfound partnership with the Office of International Programs—which was spun off from OCS in 2002 to highlight international programs.This fall, the OIP moved for the second time in roughly a year to be near their larger counterpart, a shift administrators say is intended to increase coordination between the offices’ offerings for undergraduates by creating shared office space, joint events, and further collaborating in their online efforts.Administrators said the changes stem from a growth in responsibilities for the OIP, which recently began administering the new David Rockefeller International Experience Grants—which funded over 500 students in its inaugural year.Between the influx of funding and increasing overlap with OCS as students spend more time abroad, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds has been pushing for closer cooperation.The organizations will retain separate leadership and separate budgets—which won’t be reduced, according to Mount. The OCS director said they aren’t reuniting, but “there may be more of an umbrella structure coming.”In the coming weeks, they expect to submit a proposal outlining their plans for cooperation to Hammonds.Among other joint online projects, the OIP and OCS are testing a new internet application with the Michael C. Rockefeller Memorial Fellowship, a grant program for graduating seniors. They said they are now working out the bugs and may extend the application to more OCS/OIP programs next year.The OCS Fellowship Office is now being housed in the OIP’s two-story building at 77 Dunster St., which was formerly home to the Core Curriculum Office.The OIP temporarily had been located at 2 Arrow St, after moving out of its University Hall offices last summer. The OCS is located at 54 Dunster St.The offices recently held a joint fair to provide students with an opportunity to explore their options in the United States and abroad and are planning similar joint events this year.Administrators from both organizations said that their offices’ physical proximity will provide the opportunity to initiate the cooperation that they—and Hammonds—see as increasingly necessary.Hammonds, who oversees the two offices, said that she has asked for the cooperation as part of a University-wide effort to streamline programs. “We want to see a structure in the College where the various offices are closely collaborating,” she said.The increased coordination follows the merging of two other pairs of Harvard offices in recent months. Within the College, the Offices of Student Life and Activities and Residential Life folded into the Office of Student Life. And earlier this month, the Faculty of Arts and Science communications were merged into the University’s Public Affairs and Communication Office.Hammonds said the cooperation between the OIP and OCS was especially apt. “This is about the two organizations that work on student internships, fellowships, study abroad, career issues they just had a joint career fair,” she said. “These are things that fit well together.”OIP Director Catherine H. Winnie emphasized the two offices’ ability to productively coordinate their efforts.“We have a responsibility to step up, and you can’t do that alone,” Winnie said in a joint interview with Mount and Erin E. Goodman, Assistant Director of the OIP.Mount and Winnie added that the new proximity will improve their offices’ teamwork.“It was hard, we had to walk all the way over there,” Mount said.“Oh, give me a break,” Winnie playfully retorted.—Staff Writer Eric P.

Starting next week, customers at Harvard Book Store will be able to buy in minutes books that once would have taken weeks to find.
The service comes courtesy of the Mass. Ave. retailer’s new printing machine, which will make it the first bookseller in the nation with the ability to print 3.6 million titles on demand.
The Espresso Book Machine—produced by New York-based firm On Demand Books—has been rolled out to a select few stores to date, but the one at Harvard Book Store will be the first with access to the 2 million public-domain texts digitized by Google, which also announced a deal with On Demand last Thursday.
After the unveiling on Sept. 29, Harvard Book Store customers will be able to order a printed copy of Google’s titles or On Demand’s 1.6 million works—all in public domain because they were copy-righted before 1923.
Store Marketing Manager Heather Gain said owner Jeffrey Mayersohn ’73 bought the machine in pursuit of a broader vision for the store—which he took over from long-time owner Frank Kramer last October. “He would like to provide customers with every book ever written,” Gain said. 
The Espresso Book Machine will be able to print a 300-page paperback book in four minutes, according to Gain, who added that printed books will be competitively priced and indistinguishable from those sitting on the shelves.
Customers will be able to request a book to be printed online or in the store, after which they can either pick it up in-store within minutes or have the book delivered by bicycle either the same or next day. Books can also be shipped to domestic or overseas locations.
On Demand CEO Dane Neller said he hopes the Espresso Book Machine will revolutionize the book industry by eventually making any book available—regardless of its popularity. “We want to make sure that a book never goes out of print.”
Daniel Eastman, general director of Schoenhof’s Foreign Books on Mt. Auburn Street, said he was intrigued by the potential benefits of the Espresso Book Machine—even though most of the books available were published before 1923. “Many of my customers are interested in classic literature,” he said, “They want to read Madame Bovary in French.”  
Eastman called the trend “something to keep an eye on,” but said Schoenhof’s will wait to learn more before investing in a machine due to its $100,000 price tag.
Allan Powell, the Harvard Coop’s corporate general manager, expressed greater reservations about the technology. 
“Until printed books on demand moves to include current publications/editions, and resolves the copyright and pricing issues, we won’t know if this is a viable model for consumers and bookstores,” he wrote in an e-mailed statement.
For its part, Google plans to continue trying to add more books to its burgeoning digital collection, according to spokeswoman Jennie Johnson.
At Harvard Book Store, where customers can see the machine starting this Friday, Gain said regulars won’t have to worry about the new technology changing the store’s feel.
“We will not be removing the opportunity to browse from our customers,” she said, “We are just exponentially increasing inventory.”

Harvard’s once small collection of film stills—movie frames studied by film historians—is slowly ballooning into one of the country’s ten largest, thanks to a gift from a pair of German collectors.Munich-based couple Lothar and Eva Just are now in the process of donating their estimated 800,000-piece collection to the Harvard Film Archive. So far, the HFA has received over 42,600 items in the collection, which will take an estimated five years to arrive and catalog, according to Film Conservator Elizabeth Coffey. The HFA began receiving the shipments in May 2008.The materials—which according to Coffey include film stills, negatives, pressbooks, posters, slides and transparencies, and text documents—span all the way back into silent films and include international movies.Notably, the collection includes shots from films whose footage has been partially or wholly destroyed—such as Josef von Sternberg’s The Case of Lena Smith and Orson Welles’ The Magnificent Ambersons.The film collection is immense; “it took over [the Justs’] whole townhouse—except for the kitchen and bathroom,” said HFA Director Haden Guest. “That kind of collection is only put together with great passion and patience.”The pieces in the Just collection were originally indexed by filmmaker and subdivided into films, Guest said, and the HFA has decided to keep that system.The gift continues more than a decade of Lothar Just’s philanthropic relationship with Harvard, who began working with Germanic Languages and Literature Professor Eric Rentschler in the 1990s to help obtain several hundred 35-millimeter German feature films for Harvard’s collection from the Film and Television Board of Bavaria in cooperation with German directors and producers.Just approached Rentschler around 2005 to offer donating his film collection, Rentschler said. “This is going to be seen by film historians as an enormous help,” Rentschler said. “At a time when Harvard is building a Ph.D. program in film studies, this collection will be tremendously helpful for people writing their dissertations.”Coffey, the Harvard archive’s film conservator, said she now oversees a team of several students who are working part-time to catalog the pieces. The HFA is considering making the stills available online at some point in the future, but with years of cataloging before the collection is even assembled in the physical archive, Coffey said researchers or curious film-buffs will have to trek to the Fine Arts Library for their fix for some time to come.

When iconic Annenberg card-swiper Domna Antoniou took an early retirement package in the midst of a budgetary crackdown last spring there was an outpouring of appreciation for the 22-year Harvard University Dining Services veteran. But when budget cuts and a glimpse of greener kitchens caused former Executive Chef of Residential Dining, Larry R. Kessel, to leave Harvard in August, his departure passed nearly unnoticed by students. 
After six and a half years at Harvard, Kessel, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and a former New York and Boston restaurateur, left HUDS and joined private food provider AVI Food Systems as Executive Chef and Operations Director for Wellesley College. Kessel, who played an integral role in crafting residential menus and working on the Food Literacy Program, said a former HUDS employee had been recruiting him to work at AVI for the past three years.
“It was the right opportunity at the right time,” Kessel said. “This is a new property so there was that challenge and that opportunity, and I like opening up new projects. Also there was a larger potential for growth.”
Kessel also noted that his position at Wellesley would be “more financially rewarding.”  
In January, in an effort to consolidate its budget, HUDS eliminated the Executive Chef of Residential Dining position, and shifted Kessel to Executive Chef of the Cook and Chill Division, which handles the preparation and distribution of soups and sauces for the House dining halls. 
“Larry’s title [of Executive Chef] didn’t change,” said HUDS Director for Culinary Operations Martin T. Breslin. “He was just refocused.”  
In his new position, Kessel’s administrative oversight was narrowed—from control of whole menus to a focus on condiments and appetizers. Breslin said that he took over Kessel’s administrative tasks. 
But HUDS Director for Marketing and Communications Crista Martin said that Kessel’s position at HUDS had been in no way downgraded, but that he left to pursue a career opportunity. 
At Wellesley, Kessel will be in charge of all culinary operations including running Wellesley’s five uniquely-themed dining halls, according to Dawn Perry, AVI Food Systems’ vice president for marketing.
“He is the absolute ending point for all things culinary on campus and has the full authority to write local menus and change menus as needed based on students’ needs,” Perry said. “We are very excited to have him on our team.”
“One of the great things for me that was a deal-closer was that at Harvard all the dining halls serve the same food,” Kessel said. “But [at Wellesley] I have five locations that all get different menus and different cuisines.”
Because Wellesley contracts a private company to run their food services, the university saves on overhead costs such as health and benefits packages for chefs and culinary administrators. Perry said that she believes this gives the school greater budgetary flexibility.
But Martin says that she believes HUDS’ University affiliation gives it a unique place within the College.
“We are pleased to be an integral part of the House system, where community happens every day,” she said. “What happens at Harvard doesn’t happen anywhere else and that comes with challenges as well as opportunities.”
Though Kessel admitted that HUDS had been feeling the effects of budget cuts for quite some time, he said that he believes HUDS still runs one of the College’s benchmark programs.
“This is not the first time in history they’ve had to make cuts in the dining halls,” he said. “But everything is cyclical, that’s just where the university is right now.”

Founded by two Harvard alumni, the newly-formed Ivy Key SAT preparation company may seem a bit exclusive at first glance. After all, its stated hiring policy is to “only select tutors who have either graduated from or are currently attending an Ivy League school or institution of equal quality.” But founders Chris L. McConnell ’08 and Jae R. Gardner ’07 were determined to assist students lacking financial and academic resources when they created the company in January of 2009. The company has a for-profit private tutoring program that funds their philanthropic endeavor, Climbing Ivy, dedicated to serving low-income students. With a commitment to education, community and social entrepreneurship, the Harvard graduates formed their business despite skepticism about offering anything for free during a recession. “With the economic downturn, what better time than now to impact the community in a positive way,” Gardner said. McConnell and Gardner are equally emphatic in their perception of business and education as working hand-in-hand. “Social entrepreneurship is huge,” said McConnell, who added that running a business in conjunction with non-profit tutoring is “a natural fit.”Mark Greenstein, founder and director of an entirely for-profit SAT preparation program, Ivy Bound, is less optimistic about the sustainability of programs like Climbing Ivy. Though Ivy Bound has an outreach program in low-income areas, local schools cover the cost for these programs. “More power to them,” said Greenstein of Ivy Key, “but no one can just donate their time.”Harvard Sociology lecturer David L. Ager has more hope for entrepreneurial efforts to help students of low socioeconomic status achieve equal opportunities. “It really is exciting to see more and more students involved in the macro-social phenomenon of putting their intellect toward helping the community,” he said, adding that proper funding and a sound business model created in clever and innovative ways would allow such a program to be sustainable.McConnell and Gardner are confident in Climbing Ivy’s ability to survive. “At the end of the day, education is the heart of the business,” said Gardner, continuing that “education should be a right, not a privilege. If you just can’t afford it, you shouldn’t be pushed to the end of the line.” Arun A. Alagappan, director of the test preparation program Advantage Testing Foundation, applauds Climbing Ivy’s mission to provide confidence and future opportunities for its students. “Long-term test prep is in the interest of society as a whole,” he said. “It’s important to bring talent from every sector to the leadership pool of the whole country.”

Professor Louise Cainkar led a talk yesterday on her new work “Homeland Insecurity: The Arab-American Experience after 9/11” as part of a series of “Islam in the West” seminars organized by the Center for Middle Eastern Studies here at Harvard. This effort is one of the reasons that led the Center for Middle Eastern Studies to expand and build an interdisciplinary study of the Muslim culture, said Jocelyne Cesari, director of the Islam in the West Institute, a part of the Center. Harvard students and other affiliates have been involved in research and graduate study workshops in the organization’s attempt to assist a contemporary wave of thinking about Islamic culture. The event consisted of two sections: a presentation about the content of Cainkar’s book and a discussion with the audience. The presentation provided analysis and evaluation based on Cainkar’s book—“the first in-depth post 9/11 survey,” according to Cesari. Cainkar spoke on her methodology, having interviewed 102 Muslims in the suburban and metropolitan Chicago area after the incident as part of her research. According to Cainkar’s findings, “the anti-Muslim social climate had been there” since before 9/11, with the attacks just providing an open forum for the “defensive hate crimes.” She evaluates the different responses from the Muslim community, whether through increasing  religiosity, strengthening of bonds between different Muslim communities or segregating from non-citizens.The growth in “non-quantifiable hate crimes” has, however, affected the environment for the better in that it brought this racial issue to center stage, Cainkar said, adding that this is essential to ease the way of the process of integration. Some attendees were skeptical of Cainkar’s findings.“It was based on self-selecting statistics, exclusive of FBI’s studies”, said Phillip Davis, a non-Harvard affiliate, who expressed his disagreement with Professor’s treatment of the government’s involvement in dealing with the tense environment of 9/11. Michael McCarrick, an intern at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, disagreed. “She presented a lot of interesting, in-depth data. I was surprised at some of the results”, he said. But Cainkar cautioned that much still needs to be done to resolve the racial issue.“The sad thing is, though, we have not learned a thing”, Cainkar said. “We keep making the same mistakes.”

Due especially to economic concerns, many Asian-born students are choosing to attend universities in Asia rather than in the U.S. and other Western nations, according to an article published in the New York Times on Saturday.“The schools in Singapore are world-class, they’re close by, and they’re a lot cheaper,” said Harvard student Michelle B. Nguyen ’13, who was born in Vietnam and attended high school in Singapore.William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, dean of admissions and financial aid, noted the dramatic increase in applicants from China in particular. At a mere 50 applicants a decade ago, application numbers from the world’s most populous country rose each year, peaking with the Class of 2012, which saw 484 applicants from China. This past year, 417 Chinese students bid for spots in the Class of 2013.“Certainly after 10 years of such increases, one expects a levelling off,” Fitzimmons said of the 14 percent decrease. “And as attractive as American universities might be, China certainly is working a great deal to make its institutions more competitive.”John P. Gobok ’12, who grew up in the Philippines, said that the economic recession has made it less feasible for students in his native country to study in America. “Asian students still want to come to the U.S., but because of the expense, they’re choosing to stay in Asia,” Gobok said. “It’s not because they want to, it’s because they have to.”Fitzsimmons said that Harvard’s need-blind financial aid policy for all applicants has played a significant role in enticing international students. “There is a very small number of other universities in the US that offer similar kinds of financial aid, so those that have financial aid for international students are a very attractive option. It allows us to be much more competitive,” Fitzsimmons said.Having travelled to China and Vietnam to speak to prospective students last fall, Fitzsimmons affirmed Harvard’s desire to bring in “students from all regions of Asia.”These recruiting trips have grown increasingly important as universities in Asia continue to draw more students from the region with scholarships and improving facilities. A report released by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in July showed that East Asia and the Pacific have become home to more and more of the world’s university students over the past decades. In 1970, the region claimed 14 percent of students, while almost half of all students studied in the United States and Western Europe. In 2007, nearly a third of university students could be found in East Asia and the Pacific compared with 23 percent in Western nations.Despite the lower price and greater convenience of schools in his native Singapore, Colin Teo ’12 said he’s glad he decided to come to the U.S. “I don’t think I would have gotten a worse education in Singapore than at Harvard, but I learn so much more at Harvard out of the classroom,” Teo said. “Getting to meet people from 60 different countries and living in a different society has really opened me up a lot—that’s something I never could have learned at home.”

Speaking to an intimate gathering of Harvard’s literary community last night, guest speaker John D’Agata spoke out against the view that most people “are fearful of the essay because they were things that we had to do here in school.”
In place of such a limited conception of the essayistic form, D’Agata advocated for a different critical interpretation—the essay as art. 
Holding a public reading in the Barker Center, D’Agata read excerpts from “The Lost Origins of the Essay,” his new anthology. After beginning with a reading from the introduction of the work, a succession of Harvard professors read selected essays from the anthology. The evening concluded with a question-and-answer session with the author himself.
After citing the contractual writings in ancient Mesopotamia as the first system of (albeit primitive) literature, D’Agata proceeded to explain that these writings represented the “worst kind of nonfiction there is”: writing which seeks solely to convey information. 
“Instead, I am here in search of art,” the author explained.
D’Agata said he was determined to compile an anthology of essays which could dispel the notion of the essay as a genre devoted solely to instruction and the conveyance of information.
To accomplish this goal, D’Agata included essays from Ziusudra, William Blake, Matsuo Basho, Clarice Lispector, and Jonathan Swift, among others, and he explained that such writers respected the essay as an art form.
Professor of Creative Writing Joanna G. Klink further articulated the miscategorization of the essay when she asserted that “the essay is searching for a way of being in the world.” 
To remedy this lack of critical respect, Klink, reading from D’Agata’s book, made use of an essay by Samuel Beckett. 
The essay, “Afar, A Bird,” hearkens to Blake’s poetic works, further proof that the essay can be interpreted as a work of art. 
Although the audience seemed captivated by the readings throughout, several spoke up to ask questions at the conclusion of the event.
When asked whether the essay could achieve the artistic recognition that other genres have received, D’Agata explained that while students and professors may be forced to classify literary works as pertaining to different genres, essays should, in the artistic sense, exist for their own sake, just as any other painting, novel, or sculpture.

Sometimes you just have to bring out the big guns.Down 18-10 in the third frame of its contest against Holy Cross, the Harvard women’s volleyball (4-7) team needed a serious boost to regain its momentum and avoid dropping its second frame in a row.Enter sophomore Anne Carroll Ingersoll. The 6’2” outside hitter walked onto the court of the Malkin Athletic Center for the first time in the game and immediately dropped two kills. From there, Ingersoll helped catalyze a crescendo in her team’s play that eventually put the Crimson over Holy Cross (1-12) in overtime, 27-25.Harvard went on to close the fourth set in decisive fashion, winning the final game of its preseason schedule with the start of Ivy League competition looming this weekend. “It’s a good feeling to take into Friday,” Ingersoll said.Harvard’s performance was not as convincing out of the gate, however, and seemed uncoordinated on the attack. The two teams traded points early on, keeping close until the Crusaders used a kill from offensive maestro Megan Lynch to take a 10-7 lead. Soon thereafter, sophomore Sandra Lynn Fryhofer generated renewed life for the Crimson, letting loose a devastating kill before tossing out back-to-back service aces to tie the score at 11.Several plays later, co-captain Chelsea Ono Horn saved a monstrous strike from becoming a kill, eventually allowing the Crimson to take a 13-12 lead. With the previous coordination problems resolved, senior Lily Durwood deftly put up a ball that senior Alissa Flesher knocked to the Holy Cross court without contention to close the set out at 25-19.Flesher, who notched 12 kills throughout the game, was one of four Harvard players who racked up double-digit kills.The Crimson returned to the court in the second set with all cylinders still firing, carrying over the previous frame’s momentum to jump out to an early lead. Junior Mikaelle Comrie accounted for a large chunk of Harvard’s offense throughout the night, leading the Crimson with 13 kills–most of which hit the ground before the Crusaders could react.Although Holy Cross spent much of the second frame in a deficit, the Crusaders crept up down the stretch and eventually forced a tie at 24-24. Harvard went up on the ensuing point, but Holy Cross utilized a 3-0 run to take the set.“We didn’t necessary play in our system towards the end of the game,” Comrie said. “I think that was to our detriment.”The third frame emulated the predecessor in every way–save for a role reversal.The Crusaders held a significant lead throughout most of the frame and looked poised to take the set easily.The Crimson offense that had congealed well during the previous set continued its downward trend to start the third frame; the women’s squad committed nine errors throughout the set. However, it was Harvard’s turn for a comeback once Ingersoll–who had been sick lately–took the court. “It’s nerve-wracking to be on the bench,” Ingersoll said. “You warm up, but then you get cold and you’re thinking, ‘Oh no what if I biff it?’ It’s all or nothing.”There would be no biffing for Ingersoll, however. In just 1.5 sets, the sophomore racked up 11 kills and a .714 hitting percentage.With its top offensive weapon back in play, the Crimson won eight of the next 10 points. Harvard soon pulled to 24-23, emulating the Crusaders’ work the previous set.“Everyone just realized at that point that we weren’t going to have a repeat of the second game, and we really needed to finish it,” Comrie said. At 24-23, Ingersoll applied two critical kills to give the Crimson the advantage before freshman Taylor Docter ended it with a kill of her own at 27-25. In the fourth, Harvard relied on the power of Comrie’s blasts to keep its offensive tempo up while Holy Cross pestered the Crimson early on with misleading drop shots. Harvard mustered its way to a 14-10 lead as the Crusaders lost composure. Gaining momentum, the Crimson pumped up its advantage to 19-13 off of two consecutive, well-placed Ingersoll kills.  With the score at 22-14, the stage was set for more dramatics. This time, though, there would be no epic comeback. The final set of the game finished in mundane fashion, with a Wu serve resulting in a Holy Cross attack error to close out the set at 25-15.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say there is no such thing as perfect—yet the Harvard men’s soccer team would beg to differ. The sixth-ranked Crimson has kicked off its 2009 season with a spotless 5-0-0 record and is looking to continue the pattern in this week’s two matches. Harvard is taking on New Hampshire (2-3-1) at 4 p.m. this afternoon in the second of four straight road games. Saturday will be a battle between top ten teams as the Crimson challenge No. 3 Wake Forest (3-1-1) in Winston-Salem, N.C., at 7 p.m.Harvard has earned its national ranking with a perfect non-conference record so far this year. Most recently, the team defeated Fairfield last Saturday in a 4-1 decision. Co-captain and Top Drawer Soccer National Player of the Week Andre Akpan led the effort with two goals and an assist. Freshmen Brian Rogers and Zack Wolfenzon each tallied a goal of their own as well.Akpan has been crucial to the Crimson’s success and leads the team in shots, assists, goals scored, and total points. However when asked about his success this season, the veteran is quick to recognize the team’s effort as a whole.“What we’ve been really focused on this year is being strong on defense which develops into good offense. So far we’ve seen really good results,” he said.In fact, Harvard’s defense has given up only two goals in five games, while the offense has scored an impressive 15 goals on its opponents. This eye for the net ranks the Crimson third in the nation in goals scored.Today’s matchup against the Wildcats will be a great opportunity for Harvard to continue its momentum going into Saturday’s highly-anticipated game. In two of the past three meetings between the teams, UNH has come out on top, but the Crimson is hoping to repeat last season’s success. Exactly one year ago Harvard defeated UNH 3-1 on home turf at Ohiri Field.Akpan recognized that while the game against the Wildcats is as significant as any other, most of the attention is on the weekend game against the third best squad in the nation.“Both are important games. Wake Forest is obviously a little more exciting because of their ranking,” the team captain said.But his teammate emphasized that the Crimson isn’t affected by the reputation of its opponent, no matter the media attention.“We go out and impose our identity on the other teams and it works out in our favor,” junior Robert Millock said.The Demon Deacons boasted an undefeated record of their own until they fell to No. 20 Virginia 1-0 last Friday. The game also marked the end of the team’s 35-game home win streak.However, Wake Forest has proven itself among the college soccer elite with wins against other top-ranked opponents earlier this season. This September the Demon Deacons have tied No. 10 Notre Dame in double overtime, defeated No. 7 Indiana on the road, and taken down Clemson in their ACC opener.Harvard has the chance to solidify its spot in the top ten with a win on Saturday. In reference to rankings, the Crimson may appear to be the game’s underdog, but a closer look reveals that it holds a considerable advantage.Harvard’s goals-per-game average of 3.00 is more than twice that of Wake Forest’s 1.40 average. The Demon Deacons have also allowed opponents .80 goals per game, while the Crimson and its goalkeeper Austin Harms have allowed half that and have already secured two shutouts.With consistently good play, Harvard has all the pieces in place to continue its success. In addition to Akpan’s tremendous effort this season, the Crimson will rely on solid performances up and down its lineup to continue overcoming challenges on the road. So far, Harvard has proven itself among non-conference opponents, but this weekend also marks the last chance to prepare for its Ivy League opener against rival Yale on October 3. Two worthy opponents and a top ten team face the Crimson men this week in their mission to secure the best record to start a season in school history, but amidst the pressure, the team is keeping its focus.As Millock said, “Nothing matters until we make it to the NCAA’s and win the Ivies.”

It looks as though the J-Term housing game just got even harder.
We've known for awhile that varsity athletes, international students, lab assistants, and thesis writers constituted the "elect" who were to receive highly coveted J-Term campus housing this coming January, when most Harvard students wishing to come back to Cambridge will just have to stay at home and see how long they can stand trying to remember high school inside jokes.
But now, the stakes are even higher for some students who were guaranteed housing, particularly for the thesis writers. FlyBy received word that now, some of Harvard's most devoted agents of pure and practical academic inquiry must now submit roughly a one-page-long proposal outlining their particular thesis projects AND (and this is a big AND) the specific resources they will need on campus.
If housing is really that expensive to maintain during J-Term--even for those who need it the most--FlyBy wonders whether Harvard will offer these thesis writers the discounted option of the Quad....
Read the full text of the J-Term stipulations after the jump.
Dear Thesis Writer,
Thank you for your application for Winter Break on campus housing. In order to best assess individual needs, we ask that you send a 1/2 to 1 page description of your thesis project, including what specific resources you will need on campus. Please send this information to me as soon as possible atjanuary@fas.harvard.edu.
Please feel free to reach out for additional questions or clarification.
Sincerely,
Dean Inge-Lise Ameer

This winter, the men's hockey team could be keeping a few more brain cells.
Harvard recently announced that it will be the first team in the nation to test a new, state-of-the-art helmet made to decrease the incidence of concussions—a common injury in hockey, and one that can cut short a career.
The Crimson will be a guinea pig for NHL Hall of Famer Mark Messier, who is working to find out the best way to implement a similar helmet program in the NHL. Messier visited the locker room last week as the team tested the helmets for the first time.
With the team's heads protected, the only thing that remains to be seen is whether or not the new helmets can help bring Harvard back to the NCAA tournament for the first time in four years.

New York City Resident Jason Aquino, one of the three men allegedly involved in the fatal Kirkland House shooting this May, will not be charged for murder, prosecutors said today.
Aquino, 23, will now face charges of being an accessory after the fact of armed robbery and carrying a firearm without license. He has been held without bail since his lower court arraignments on August 3. New bail will be set at Aquino’s arraignment tomorrow in Middlesex Superior Court.
Corey Welford, a spokesman for the Middlesex district attorney’s office, told the Associated Press that prosecutors dropped the murder charges in part due to “additional developments of the facts and witness statements.”
Welford declined to disclose any new details about the May 18th shooting, citing the secrecy of the grand jury process.
First-degree charges remain against the two other men, Jabrai Jordan Copney, 20, and Blayn “Bliz” Jiggetts, 19. Copney pleaded not guilty at his arraignment, and Jiggetts is awaiting extradition from New York.The three men were allegedly involved in what prosecutors called a “drug rip”. Aquino, Copney, and Jiggetts, none of whom were Harvard students, arranged to meet Cosby on May 18 and planned to rob him.
During the meeting, multiple shots were fired in the basement of Kirkland J entryway. One of the shots struck Cosby and resulted in his death. Investigators later found marijuana and approximately $1,000 near Cosby’s body.
The three men fled the scene and returned to New York City that evening.
Copney was arrested in Harlem on May 21 and later indicted by a Middlesex Superior Court grand jury on charges including murder, accessory after the fact of murder, and possession of a firearm. He is being held without bail.
Jiggetts was arrested on June 9 and was indicted on July 10 by a Middlesex grand jury on similar charges. He has not yet been arraigned in Massachusetts.
Harvard University Police, Cambridge Police, state police, and the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office continue to investigate the murder.
