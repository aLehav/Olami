After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over two months ago, 2,631 students cast ineffectual, symbolic ballots on an Undergraduate Council referendum asking Harvard to divest from fossil fuels. The result? A massive victory for the Harvard Pat Yourself on the Back Caucus. Fossil fuel divestment “passed” the UC with 71.5 percent of the vote, 71.5 percent more than the percentage of Harvard’s endowment which will be divested from fossil fuels. Harvard Management Company’s Board of Directors, the body with the power to manage Harvard’s endowment, was bound to take no action as a result of the vote. Despite the results of the referendum, divestment remains a pipe dream.
I can’t blame or judge those who supported the referendum. I voted for divestment. I believe that the global reliance on fossil fuels is leading to massive increases in destructive greenhouse gasses, and that Harvard damages its moral standing by affiliating itself with it. Harvard has already divested from big tobacco in 1990. And I believe saying that the University has no choice but to invest its endowment in morally questionable industries is logically disingenuous.
Though divestment is an honorable goal, we achieved nothing honorable by voting for it. If University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Harvard’s Board of Overseers were to act on the UC referendum, it would take a while before the possible effects of increased tuition and decreased University funding impacts students’ Harvard experiences. The student body would have taken a moral stand without facing any consequences.
If we’re as serious about fighting climate change as 71.5 percent of us claim to be, let’s take direct action and put our showerheads where our mouths are. Let’s ask Harvard Campus Services to disable hot water in student dorms and martyr ourselves with 50-degree showers for the planet.
Imagine the case that would make for divestment. Harvard students care enough about climate change to put themselves on cold rinse in February, in the middle of a snowstorm. With effective messaging, a cold-shower, energy-conserving movement could spread to schools around the country. Instead of agitating for legislators and bureaucrats to make changes, students could be the changemakers for energy conservation ourselves, with Harvard leading the way.
Granted, I like my hot showers as much as the next person. But they are not a necessity. Military academies sometimes go without. Some people never take hot showers to begin with. In an age where the depletion of our resources and the mass consumption of energy are enormous concerns, we should ask ourselves what is necessary, as we ask corporations and other fossil fuel producing industries to do the same.
Hot showers aren’t the only concrete sacrifices we can make to show we’re serious about conservation. San Francisco in 2015 launched an initiative called “Brown is the new Green,” encouraging residents to stop watering their lawns to conserve water in the midst of a historic drought. Imagine the statement on climate change we would make if we stopped watering Harvard Yard and let it go brown.
Both of these changes would impact important and visible parts of our days. Some would argue they go further than necessary. But perhaps drastic action is necessary in a nation whose lawmakers and in a university whose investors delay action on climate issues. Who better than the nation’s young people to shock decision makers awake? Who better than the nation’s most privileged than to make some of the first sacrifices?
We have an opportunity to prove that Harvard students are willing to sacrifice for our ideals. If we take it, we will make a much stronger case when we ask the Board of Directors to do the same.
Alternatively, we can keep voting for vague ideals that cost us nothing and move on with our lives. We are, after all, liberals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since students wrapped up classes last semester, Harvard Square has said goodbye to Crema Cafe, Chipotle, Tealuxe, Urban Outfitters, Sweet Bakery, and Au Bon Pain. Students have lamented the departure of these stores, a development which follows a pattern of storefront turnover in the Harvard Square. Rising rents and competition are to blame in part, but the planned construction to the building, which houses Urban Outfitters, Tealuxe, and Sweet Bakery, is also critical in this new wave of closures.
It is unfortunate that stores we have grown to love in Harvard Square are closing. The increase in high-end stores will have an adverse effect on both students and the residents of Cambridge, as affordable options become increasingly scarce.
After all, the food situation in Harvard Square was already dire. Due to the lack of supermarkets in the area, the U.S. Department of Agriculture classifies Harvard Square as a half-mile “low-access zone.” The University, city of Cambridge, and local developers should expand efforts to provide students and Cambridge residents access to low-cost options in Harvard Square. A potential approach, piloted by some U.S. cities, to this looming problem could be the introduction of new subsidies and tax relief programs to support businesses that offer affordable and healthy food options. Moreover, if this trend of closings continues, Harvard should consider offering more financial support to low-income students.
While consumer choice does play a role in which stores can stay and which are forced out, there are certainly other factors at play. Businesses choose what types of consumers to target. Unfortunately, an increasing number of Harvard Square businesses choose to cater to high-income individuals — whether they be students, tourists, or residents — ignoring the need for affordable food options.
To make matters worse, what little voice might typically be afforded to consumers by the power of their pocketbooks is not afforded to low-income students and Cambridge residents. Indeed, many of the stores being replaced, like Urban Outfitters and Sweet Bakery, were already pricey for many students and Cambridge residents. Two years ago, the same worry was present as Tatte replaced Panera Bread and as Pinkberry was melted down into Pressed Juicery. Stores being priced out of Harvard Square does not bode well for the affordability of future developments, as even higher-end options may replace them. In particular, residents have expressed concerns over the potential effects of a shopping center proposed by Regency Centers Corporation, which would encompass three historic buildings. If Cambridge does not heed these concerns, then residents would be left largely out of the conversation in these changes.
Like Cambridge residents, we’ve opined on this issue before. We continue to hope that Cambridge and Harvard begin to take more proactive note of the voices advocating for a more affordable Harvard Square.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During winter break, I stopped by my freshmen teacher’s geometry class, and decided to stay for a bit. Class started. Twenty minutes in, only three people gave an effort to speak, with a confidence that was minimal at best. When my teacher resorted to calling on people, the students boasted an aloofness that bordered on disrespectful. Sure, they’re high schoolers, but I don’t remember anyone in my grade being so unresponsive — was class always like this?
I ask my teacher, who has been teaching a long time, how the newest class compares to those from years past, and she echoes what I had already observed. When I ask her what’s the cause, she smiled knowingly. “Without a doubt, it’s the phones!”
With online communication becoming so normalized in the past decade, we experience less face to-face interaction on a daily basis. The benefits of such medium are plenty as we connect with people regardless of who they are, where they live, or what they do. It has bestowed upon us a virtual world of endless influence and possibilities.
Nevertheless, the obvious yet critical difference between online and normal conversation is that the former never requires one to face another person. More than ever, new generations have mastered the art of communicating online — in lieu of the more traditional ways. A recent study found teenagers spending more than a whopping nine hours in one day on media, with tweens aged from eight to twelve spending six hours. Keeping up with friends, the news, and community is shaping a generation to be more capable behind the screen then in person.
It’s true that online skills are crucial to a workplace that also wraps itself around an online platform. However, with the new generation being better versed online than in person, many subtle yet important abilities in verbal communication are jeopardized. Gestures like reading someone’s reaction and responding appropriately, empathizing with emotions that flash across a face, or even maintaining lively conversation are social actions that future generations are simply having less continuous practice with. The conventions of human empathy and emotion are being switched out for a more widespread but less sympathetic medium.
This shift in social dynamics will be felt when it comes to employees cooperating and making important decisions. We’re dealing with an incoming workforce that would rather email or message than deal with a problem in person. We’re dealing with a workforce that doesn't have the collaboration instincts needed for unexpected situations. In a world where slacktivism is rampant and social media is as pervasive as ever, our future ability to communicate in favor of change is threatened.
It’s likely that the future Harvard classes will still be more vocal than their high school peers, so perhaps this generational shift won’t be felt much on campus. However, as future leaders of their field, these classes will have to be well equipped in navigating an unprecedented range of social abilities. The important skills that are instinctual to some won’t be to others, and it’s going to take time before an adjustment for the differences is made.
There’s no way to change the focus of this epidemic without severely inhibiting online communication, which is certainly not happening soon. Therefore, this can certainly be seen as another crucial point in the case for the humanities.
Critical reading, listening to others, analyzing a perspective, and directing conversation are all trademarks of the humanities. It’s about getting to the core of what you want to know and building up the ability and confidence to find it, which is advantageous in diagnosing and solving problems that may arrive from an imbalance in communication skills.
Put frankly, the Harvard classes of the twenty first century need to prepare themselves for a fascinating shift in the way people approach complex problems. The globalization issues we’re facing are growing more dire by the minute — we can’t afford to depend on a workforce that struggles to look other people in the eye.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Actor, director, and producer Milo A. Ventimiglia is Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 2019 Man of the Year, the organization announced Wednesday.
The Pudding will present Ventimiglia with his award Feb. 8, the opening night of its 171st production “France France Revolution.” The Man of the Year festivities will begin with a celebratory roast of Ventimiglia in Farkas Hall, followed by the presentation of the “Pudding Pot” — an award given to both Man of the Year and Woman of the Year honorees — and then a press conference at 8:30 p.m.
Grace C. Ramsey ’19, president of the Pudding, said in a press release Wednesday that the group is “so excited" to honor Ventimiglia as their Man of the Year.
Ventimiglia currently stars with Mandy Moore on the NBC drama “This is Us.” His role as Jack Pearson earned him two Emmy nominations for “Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series,” along with awards from the MTV Movie & TV Awards in 2017 and the Screen Actors Guild in 2018. He will star in Fox 2000’s feature film “The Art of Racing in the Rain”, which will be released Sept. 27.
The Pudding’s Man of the Year announcement comes one day after the group named Bryce Dallas Howard its Woman of the Year. Both awards honor “performers who have made lasting and impressive contributions to the world of entertainment.”
Previous Man of the Year recipients have included Clint Eastwood, Tom Hanks, Robert DeNiro, Harrison Ford, James Franco, Justin Timberlake, Chris Pratt, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Ryan Reynolds, and most recently Paul Rudd in 2018.
Ventimiglia first gained major recognition for his breakthrough role as Jess Mariano on "Gilmore Girls" from 2002 to 2006. His television career has also included main roles in “Opposite Sex,” “The Bedford Diaries,” “Heroes,” “Mob City,” “Chosen,” and “The Whispers,” along with appearances in shows including “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” and “Gotham.” Most recently, he appeared once more as Jess Mariano on the Netflix reunion miniseries “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” in 2016.
This year's premiere of “France France Revolution" will mark the first time women have acted on a Pudding stage. The group announced during a roast honoring last year’s Woman of the Year Mila Kunis that it would admit women to the cast for the first time for the Pudding’s 171st show. That move marked a break with the Pudding’s nearly 200-year tradition of male-only casts.
“We hope that [Ventimiglia] will not only enjoy his night as our honoree, but will also enjoy watching history unfold on the Hasty Pudding stage,” Ramsey said.
Tickets for the Feb. 8 Man of the Year festivities sold out for a price of $250 each, though tickets for tomorrow’s Woman of the Year event are still available. The Pudding initially sold Woman of the Year tickets for $100, but put $20 student tickets up for sale Wednesday afternoon.

Not many high school science classes use thermal cyclers in their experiments.
The cyclers — which can cost more than $7,000 — are too expensive for many high schools to afford. But they are just one of the cutting-edge scientific tools that students at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, a public high school a few blocks from Harvard’s campus, can access.
CRLS students use instruments like thermal cyclers as part of the Life Sciences Outreach Program — a Harvard-run initiative in which local students visit University-affiliated labs to conduct experiments.
The University has more than a dozen programs and partnerships with local high schools, including the LSOP, that invite students to campus so they can supplement their academic work with some of the University’s resources. Though some programs are open to a range of local schools, many focus just on CRLS.
For some local students, the Harvard programs — including initiatives coordinated by University administrators, faculty, and student-run community service groups — have given them a glimpse of research and academics on a college campus. Some students from groups underrepresented on college campuses say the experience of working with Harvard students and faculty influenced their academic plans.
“Just to be sitting at the same benches that Harvard undergrads sit at, I think, is really powerful,” LSOP coordinator Alia Y. Qatarneh said.
But high school students are not the only ones reaping the benefits of these initiatives, according to University faculty members and program coordinators. Harvard affiliates said teaching high schoolers helped them hone their skills in the classroom and proved rewarding.
“You can learn so much from the people you are helping — it’s not just a one-way street,” said Lia Kiam ’21, co-president of College High-School Alliance: A Nexus for Creative Education, which provides SAT tutoring to CRLS students. “For us, as Harvard students, we can forget that there’s a school right nearby, but for them it’s very known that they’re in the Harvard community,
“To learn about their experiences is really beneficial to your own,” she said.
ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES
When CRLS biology teacher Paul McGuinness asked Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor Peter R. Girguis in 2006 to open up his lab to high school students, McGuinness hoped a collaboration between CRLS and Harvard would give his students the chance to “work on real, authentic, marine science projects,” he said.
Girguis accepted the request with an additional goal in mind: to inspire some students from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue studies, and possibly careers, in science.
“As the child of first generation immigrants, I was acutely aware of how students from different backgrounds often don’t have opportunities to learn about science or technology firsthand,” he said. “Having the chance to be in a lab and being afforded a greater degree of autonomy or being in an environment that is very different from their high school course experience is a real moment of growth. We treat them as colleagues and as peers, and that is very empowering.”
Both local students and Harvard affiliates say one of the greatest strengths of their partnerships is that they provide role models and mentors to some students from demographics underrepresented in higher education.
“I know personally, for me, if I saw a female with an Arabic last name donning a white coat and goggles when I was in high school, I would say ‘Yes! I want to be her,’” Qatarneh said.
Kenneth N. Salim, the superintendent of Cambridge Public Schools, said this exposure to underrepresented groups in academia helps fulfill Cambridge Public Schools’ mission of promoting “equity” and “inclusion” — a mission he said is particularly important for CRLS to achieve. The Massachusetts Department of Education recently found that 28.1 percent of students in the Cambridge school district are “economically disadvantaged,” while about 60 percent are racial minorities.
“We value tremendously the support and collaboration we have with Harvard,” Salim said. “There’s a recognition that it’s not just about access for (college-bound) students, but how we can develop a college-going culture, and provide access for those who might be the first in their family to have the opportunity to go to college.”
While participants say many of Harvard’s collaborations with local high schools help support groups that are underrepresented in higher education, one organization’s mission is specifically tailored to meet this goal. High school tutoring program Crimson Summer Academy aims to help underserved students, including some from CRLS, get into and graduate from highly selective colleges.
“The statistics on low-income students who achieve admission into top colleges and universities nationally is abysmal, and their completion rates are similarly rough, so that’s our mission,” Maxine Rodburg, the program’s director, said.
As part of the initiative, a cohort of high school students lives in the Harvard dormitories on weeknights during the summers after their freshman, sophomore, and junior years. They attend classes and meet with undergraduate mentors who advise them over the summer and during the school year.
“My mentor calls me once a month. You build strong connections. She’s always available when I need help with my academics,” said Destin E. Bundu, a participant in the program and a junior at City on a Hill Dudley Square, a charter school in Roxbury. “It definitely helps in school.”
Bundu said that, because of the program, he is “breezing through my regular classes.”
Fahedur Fahed ’22, a former CSA student who now attends Harvard, said that participating in the program gave him “inspiration” to overcome obstacles to his education.
“Growing up I used to be really ashamed of my identity as a first-gen, low-income student, but once I learned about CSA and got admitted, I felt more empowered about my identity,” he said. “I always thought of Harvard as this very elitist place that I couldn’t possibly attend, but going to CSA helped me realize that I did have a place here, and it was possible for me to attend.”
Though the program focuses on the success of individual high school students, school administrators say CSA can also help shape schools’ cultures.
“The headmasters of schools we work with say that it’s not only the students who benefit, but the families, the communities, the schools that benefit too because a cluster of our kids at a school can help change the dynamic of the school or reinforce the college-going dynamic,” Rodburg said.
'THE BEST PART OF HARVARD'
While partnerships with the University provide mentorship to local high school students, Harvard affiliates say the programs also benefit them.
“When I started my freshman fall, I was very nervous to tutor,” Julie O. Effron ’20, co-president of CHANCE, said. “Seeing how I have been able to refine my own skills in tutoring has been a huge change for me: the tool of being able to relate to someone and figure out why they are getting something wrong and the best way to explain it.”
Other PBHA group leaders said they also think that tutoring helps enhance their understanding of the material they teach.
“Sometimes we can really learn more from teaching other people than just playing our instrument because, especially for brass, it’s so difficult to describe what to do with your mouth and whatnot,” said Eliane S. Grace ’21, incoming director of HARMONY, a group that provides free music lessons to Cambridge-area students. “By teaching our instruments we learn more about them for ourselves.”
Graduate students, too, say offering classes to high schoolers has helped them enhance their teaching abilities.
Correna S. Cohen, curatorial fellow for academic and public programs for the Harvard Art Museums, said her experience in the Graduate Student Teacher Program — in which CRLS students visit the Harvard Art Museums several times over the course of a semester to hear lessons designed and taught by Graduate School of Education students — helped hone her skills in the classroom.
Cohen credits the program, which she now helps oversee, with helping complement her more abstract graduate studies with more practical experience working with high school students.
“Having a place where I could take all that theory and apply it and see if it worked, and have this ongoing lab course, was really great,” she said.
Several Harvard students said they find it gratifying to help local students.
“From my own experience, it’s so rewarding. The best part is seeing faces return week after week,” Effron said. “Forming relationships with these students, and sensing them becoming more confident in their abilities is the best feeling.”
Grace said she values the opportunity to “give people an outlet that they might not have otherwise known they wanted” by teaching local students music.
Some students said working with local high schoolers is one of their most important activities in college.
Mentoring for Crimson Summer Academy can be “very, very powerful” for undergraduates, Rodburg said.
“Many mentors say it’s the best part of Harvard for them, a number of them say it has been powerful enough that it has changed their career plans” to teaching, she said.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow offered advice on leadership and defended the importance of a liberal arts education at a talk with Harvard School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams on Wednesday.
The School of Public Health discussion, entitled “Challenging Times in Higher Education,” aimed to provide students with an opportunity to hear lessons about leadership that may not be taught explicitly in school, according to Eric R. Andersen, director of Voices in Leadership, the group that organized the talk.
Bacow shared numerous life lessons and career suggestions, telling audience members that “some of the best career decisions I have made in my entire life are jobs I have not taken.” He also advised audience members to “take a job because you have an agenda, not because the job is just there,” and “to think about the fit between themselves and the institution.”
Bacow pointed to his Tufts presidency as a key leadership experience that taught him the value of understanding an institution’s culture before attempting to change it.
“I think it’s important when you start out that you think of yourself as a cultural anthropologist who has been parachuted into some remote territory and you don’t speak the language, and you don’t know what the social conventions are, and you have to figure them out for yourself through careful observation,” he said.
Bacow outlined major leadership challenges to be aware of, particularly in higher education.
“There’s more than one way to organize an institution and you just have to be cognizant of what are the traditions and what people know and understand and are comfortable with and how you get them to appreciate that there might in fact be something different that they could benefit from,” he said.
As the conversation progressed, Bacow shared his goal of changing current social attitudes towards higher education.
“It’s the first time in my lifetime that people have questioned sending a kid to college, whether or not it’s worth it. It’s the first time in my lifetime that people have questioned whether colleges and universities are worthy of public support. It’s the first time in my lifetime where a significant portion of the population has questioned whether or not these great institutions are even good for the nation,” he said. “My highest priority is to try and change this narrative about higher education.”
Bacow argued a revival in the humanities would strengthen higher education, especially as many institutions shift their gaze towards technological advances.
“I’d like to think that we are going to have a renaissance in the humanities as we contemplate, ‘What does it mean to be human?’ in a world increasingly dominated by machines. What is it that’s distinctly human that a machine will never replicate?” Bacow said.
“A liberal arts education is the most valuable way to prepare us for the future,” Williams added.
As the conversation came to a close, Bacow implored audience members to “always do the right thing” above all else.
“It’s usually not that difficult to figure out,” he said. “It’s often excruciatingly difficult to do and leadership is about doing the right thing especially when it’s very very hard.”

Harvard Senior Vice President and General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83 has been chosen as the next president of Gettysburg College.
Iuliano — who oversees Harvard’s legal strategy in the midst of multiple high-profile lawsuits — will begin his new role in Gettysburg, Pa. on July 1 after the school’s current president, Janet M. Riggs, retires, according to a statement posted on Gettysburg College’s website.
The Gettysburg College board of trustees unanimously selected Iuliano.
Iuliano told the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, that he is “grateful” to Harvard for shaping who he is today.
“It has been a privilege to have served this remarkable institution for the past 25 years,” Iuliano said. “The work has mattered enormously to me, and I have found deep satisfaction in partnering with the faculty, students, and staff who make Harvard what it is and in helping to advance Harvard’s research and educational mission.”
Iuliano graduated from the College in 1983 with a degree in Government before attending University of Virginia Law School. Prior to joining Harvard’s Office of General Counsel in 1994, he worked as an associate at the law firm Choate, Hall & Stewart and later as a federal prosecutor. He became vice president and general counsel in 2003.
Iuliano is departing Harvard at a time when the University is facing a slew of publicly salient and high-stakes lawsuits. His decision to leave the General Counsel’s office comes as many of these suits reach critical junctures.
In his role as general counsel, Iuliano has overseen the University’s legal strategy as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants in its admissions process. The lawsuit was brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions in 2014. The case’s three-week trial ended in November, and federal Judge Allison D. Burroughs is expected to issue a ruling in the coming months. Some legal experts say this case could climb all the way to the Supreme Court.
Last month, a group of parent organizations for national fraternities and sororities, along with one Harvard fraternity and three students, also filed two lawsuits alleging the College’s 2016 sanctions on single-gender organizations are discriminatory and unconstitutional. The sanctions, which took effect with the Class of 2021, bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding campus leadership positions, captaining varsity athletic teams, and receiving endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
Harvard has until Feb. 4 to respond to the federal plaintiffs’ complaint and Feb. 8 to respond to the complaint within state court.
In addition to his administrative responsibilities, Iuliano has also taught courses at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the College during his tenure. This semester, he is teaching Freshman Seminar 70W: "Contemporary Issues in American Higher Education,” which will cover issues like free speech on campus, race in college admissions, and fossil fuel divestment, according to its course listing.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow told the Gazette that Iuliano is a “fabulous leader” and praised Gettysburg College for hiring him.
“Bob Iuliano is one of the most talented leaders with whom I have ever been privileged to work,” Bacow said. “Gettysburg has chosen well.”
Bacow also thanked Iuliano for his service to Harvard and for his personal counsel.
“Bob has contributed immeasurably to Harvard during his 25-year career here,” Bacow said. “I have come to rely on Bob’s sage advice during my tenure as both a member of the Corporation and now as president.”
“He is not only a great lawyer; he has become a great friend,” Bacow added.
Bacow said he will begin a search for Iuliano’s replacement in the coming weeks.

Religious leaders and activists spoke in praise of unity across diversity and tackled questions about the intersection of faith and activism at an Institute of Politics panel Wednesday evening.
Harvard Kennedy School Professor Cornell W. Brooks moderated the event, titled “Moral Resistance: When Faith and Activism Meet in the Streets." Panelists included Harvard Muslim Chaplain Khalil Abdur-Rashid; the Rev. J. Bryan Hehir, professor of the practice of religion and public life at the Kennedy School; Brittany Packnett, vice president of National Community Alliances and Engagement for Teach for America; and Rabbi Jonah D. Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.
Despite hailing from different religious backgrounds, panelists said they were among friends and colleagues. Several said they had once fought together for causes such as racial justice and gun control.
Referring to a line in the Quran, Abdur-Rashid said inclusion serves as a crucial tenet in Islam.
“When you’re asked to make space in your places, make space in your places,” he said.
Hehir further emphasized, “God is universally inclusive.”
Brooks posed a question about how religious communities can better foster inclusion, especially during a time of growing extremism and rising hate crime rates.
He said the panel “occurs at a moment of unprecedented activism, but it is also a dangerous moment.”
Addressing the issue of division, Abdur-Rashid said he feels strongly about the need to advocate from one’s principles above all else.
“If we try to make connections and stand for what’s right, not what’s convenient, that goes a long way from my experience,” Abdur-Rashid said.
Packnett said she was inspired by the leadership of Reverend Traci Blackmon, a pastor at Christ The King United Church of Christ in Florissant, Mo. who was active during the protests in Ferguson, Mo. in 2014.
Blackmon "brought the church out to the streets of Ferguson" when some people did not feel comfortable attending the church, Packnett said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the public comment period for United States Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos’s proposed Title IX rules drew to a close Wednesday night, Harvard Law School faculty members Jeannie Suk Gersen, Nancy Gertner, and Janet E. Halley submitted their own response praising and critiquing the requirements.
In their 22-page commentary on the new rules, the faculty members presented revisions to the Department of Education’s proposed definition of sexual harassment and live cross-examination requirement. They also denounced the proposals’ new evidentiary standard option for formal investigations.
DeVos released the new rules for enforcing Title IX — a federal anti-discrimination law that underpins Harvard’s policies on sexual misconduct — in November 2018, opening them up to a 60-day comment period that ended Jan. 30. The rules have faced criticism since an earlier version was leaked in August 2018, drawing criticisms for narrowing the definition of “sexual harassment” and introducing live cross-examinations. Many have argued this practice would deter victims of sexual misconduct from coming forward.
The Department had received more than 96,000 comments as of Wednesday evening.
The Law School faculty members’ contribution — submitted independently from the University — came shortly after Harvard offered its own commentary via the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts and the Association of American Universities. The two coalitions published their critiques of the new Title IX rules on behalf of their membership schools last week.
Gersen, Gertner, and Halley wrote they support the new proposals’ mandated live hearings as a method that “allows parties to probe, and decision-makers to assess, the credibility of the parties and of witnesses.” The university coalitions strongly denounced this aspect of the proposal.
In the right environment, Halley said in an interview, cross-examinations are a useful tool, especially when regulated by formal legal proceedings that can prevent issues like duplicative questioning.
“All of those protective rules that govern cross-examinations in a trial keep it from being abuse,” she said.
In their comment, however, the faculty members wrote cross-examinations could cause harm to both complainants and respondents if questioning were to grow too harsh.
Instead, they proposed a “submitted questions” method currently employed at the Law School, wherein both parties can submit questions to a case’s investigator. The investigator, the faculty members recommend, would be responsible for asking all questions, except for those deemed “irrelevant, excluded by a rule of evidence clearly adopted in advance, harassing, or duplicative.”
In addition to their proposed modifications to the live hearing process, the Law School faculty members critiqued the rules’ new definition of “sexual harassment.”
Under Obama-era Title IX policies, sexual harassment was defined as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” that included “requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.”
The new rules redefine sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity,” based on Supreme Court precedent.
This definition is “both too narrow and too broad,” the faculty members’ comment reads. Their response contended that the rule should require all hostile environment claims to be “objectively reasonable,” and that a claim should only need to be severe or pervasive — not both.
In a press release, the faculty members reiterated that their critiques and endorsements of the new Title IX rules are all aimed at improving students’ academic experiences and protecting both complainants and respondents.
“I wish that more advocates would take into account the possibility – the reality, in my view – that men of color, trans students, and people with disabilities are subjected to unfair accusations and unfair processes precisely because of their non-normative status in society,” Halley wrote in an emailed statement.
“A fair process that cares both about sexual assault and other forms of discrimination should be an important goal,” she added.

​​​​​
The Faculty Council voted to approve a proposal to allow undergraduates to obtain concurrent bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Harvard at its first meeting of 2019.
The Council — the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ highest governing body — first heard the concurrent degree program proposal at one of its biweekly meetings last December. The proposal follows the Faculty’s recent decision to abolish the College’s Advanced Standing program, a decades-old initiative which allowed students who complete enough advanced coursework in high school to enter Harvard with a year’s worth of college credits. Students could then choose to earn a bachelor’s degree in three years or both a master’s and a bachelor’s in four.
Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Noël Bisson said in 2017 that only a “tiny” portion of the student body chose to pursue Advanced Standing each year, though she declined to specify how many.
Under the proposed system — first presented to the Council by Comparative Literature Professor Karen L. Thornber — students would be allowed to double-count three courses toward both bachelor’s and master’s degrees, according to Council member David L. Howell.
“This is a proposal for a new way for some students who are well-qualified and highly motivated to get both a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in four years,” Howell said.
The Council’s referendum is purely advisory, however, and the proposal must go before the full Faculty for a vote before it can be approved. If it passes, students starting with the Class of 2022 would be eligible to apply, and the program would be reviewed during the 2024-2025 academic year.
The Council heard two other proposals — one concerning the Visual and Environmental Studies department and the other about the FAS Standing Committee on the Library — at its “very brief” meeting, according to Howell.
The VES proposal suggests changing the name of the department — which houses classes for the visual arts as well as the “study of the built environment” — to Art, Film, and Visual Studies. Department Chair Robb Moss first presented the proposal at the Council’s Dec. 14, meeting, and Council members voted in favor of the change Wednesday.
The Council also voted to approve a proposal to dissolve the FAS Standing Committee on the Library, Howell said. The proposal — first presented to the Council by Vice President for the Harvard Library Sarah E. Thomas at the Dec. 14 meeting — relegates the committee’s duties to the University-wide Faculty Advisory Council, which reserves seven seats for professors within FAS.
Unlike the votes in favor of the concurrent degree system and the renaming of the VES department, the Council’s decision to dissolve the committee is binding, according to Howell.

Harvard will seek to extend its winning streak this weekend as it travels to face Yale on Friday and Brown on Saturday in its first full Ivy League weekend of the season.
The Crimson (9-6, 2-0 Ivy) has been rolling since a two week break in the middle of December, returning from the break to win five straight, three of which came on the road and one at No. 14 California, which became the highest ranked opponent defeated by an Ivy League team since Harvard famously beat No. 1 Stanford in the first round of the 1998 NCAA Tournament. Over the five game stretch, the Crimson has thrashed teams by an average of 17 points.
“That win against Cal early in that winning streak was big for us in terms of our confidence,” captain Madeline Raster said. “We’re definitely clicking on the offensive end, which has been very helpful. We’ve also played good defense, especially in the first game against Dartmouth.”
Harvard blanked the Big Green in the first quarter of that first game against Dartmouth two weeks ago, setting the tone for the dominant defensive performance that spurred the Crimson’s sweep of its rivals to the northwest. In the two wins against Dartmouth, Harvard gave up just 103 combined points.
Those defensive performance, though, came against a team that averages just 62 points per game, seventh in the Ivy League. Yale (11-6, 1-1) and particularly Brown (9-9, 1-1) will provide a different type of threat.
The Bulldogs are led by junior guard Roxy Barahman and freshman forward Camilla Emsbo, who Head Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith pointed to as a potential problem on the boards.
“I know Yale has a nice, tall freshman [Emsbo] who’s having a strong year,” Delaney-Smith said, “so she’ll probably work hard on the boards and we’ll see what we’re made of against her for sure.”
Indeed, Yale ranks 58th in the nation in rebounding margin at +5.1, second in the Ivy League to Penn and just a hair ahead of the Crimson, which ranks 64th with a +4.8 margin. After slaughtering Dartmouth on the glass 50-34 and then 47-31, Harvard will feel that it has a good shot at neutralizing Emsbo, who averages 9.1 rebounds per game.
“I think it definitely really helps that we have strong individual rebounders like Jadyn Bush, who prioritizes rebounds and works really hard,” Raster said. “We have good rebounding guards too so I think that really helps in terms of having an overall team mentality about the importance of rebounding.”
Bush, a 5’11” sophomore forward, leads the Crimson in rebounding with 8.7 per contest. But she and 6’3” junior Jeannie Boehm will have their hands full with Emsbo, who towers over both of them at 6’5”.
Rebounding is less likely to be a problem against Brown, as the Bears’ -5.1 rebounding margin makes them the 48th worst rebounding team in the nation and worst in the Ivy League. But Brown brings other challenges to the matchup with Harvard, as in the Ivy League only the Bears outpace the Crimson’s 68 points per game. Most of Brown’s offensive firepower comes from junior guard Justine Gaziano and senior guard Shayna Mehta, who average a combined 36.8 points per game and have hit 41 threes apiece.
To Delaney-Smith, the difference in styles is not all that concerning.
“I think we have the components to be a very strong team, one of the strongest I’ve ever coached,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think game in and game out we just concentrate on what we do. We don’t spend a lot of time on our opponents. I think if we can do what we do and do it well, we’re a tough team to beat.”
This is the second of three road weekends for Harvard before they come home to face Penn and Princeton, the conference’s other two favorites, in two weeks. Raster believes that it is key for the Crimson to keep rolling heading into that big weekend.
“Our goal is to go 4-0 in the next two weekends to go into Penn and Princeton undefeated in Ivy League and to stay in the #1 spot in the league,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the influence of analytics has spread across basketball, the style of play and overall aesthetic of the sport have evolved. As teams like the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets have embraced a pace-and-space, penetrate-and-kick offensive philosophy, basketball scoring has been cleaved into two categories: interior buckets within the paint (i.e. Giannis ball) or relentless three-point shooting (i.e. Curry ball).
Here, we will focus on the latter category and look at how deep range shooting has affected not only the NBA — in which league average three-point attempts per game (31.3) are at an all-time high — but also in the collegiate ranks. Specifically, how has Harvard men’s basketball experienced a change in its three-point shooting levels?
First, we looked into two basic metrics that are found on most box scores: three-pointers attempted per game (3PA) and three-point percentage (3P%). Compiling individual game statistics dating back to the 2009-10 season, we found the average 3PA and 3P% of each season up to the most recent Jan. 26 Dartmouth contest. Below is a graph on Harvard’s average three-pointers attempted per game by season.
What is most notable here is the precipitous decline up to 2014-2015, followed by an drastic spike to a 23-plus level that has persisted to the present. Although its three-point attempts have remained relatively stable in the past three seasons, this new rate is significantly higher than the beginning of the decade, with about 5-6 more threes attempted per game.
Although the number of three-point attempts has risen in the past three seasons, shooting accuracy has not. The Crimson shot at a 40.1 percent clip in the 2012-2013 season, its highest in our measured range, but has since flattened to around the 35-36 percent range. That plateauing coincides in some way with a changing of guard, as the current highly-touted crop of juniors (including four ESPN Top 100s) first entered the team in 2016-2017.
Next, we took total three-point attempts each season and divided that number by total field goal attempts. In essence, this was the percentage of shots that came in the form of a three-point attempt.
Again, comparing from around 2014 to the present season, there is a statistically significant increase in the fraction of field goals that ended in a three-point attempt. Although the results show a marginally declining increase, the Crimson is still nevertheless showing a more aggressive season-by-season effort to take triples. This year’s current ratio is the highest in recent history at 42.6 percent. Compared to past renditions of the Harvard side (particularly pre-2016), this is a remarkably high ratio.
Finally, we did the same calculations for the remaining seven Ivy League teams and found that the Ivy average in 3PA/FGA has also seen a significant spike since the start of the decade. Currently in 2018-2019, the Ancient Eight on average attempts 42.18 three-point shots for every 100 field goal attempts, slightly below Harvard’s numbers. Princeton has recently led the pack in this category, achieving its highest three point to field goal attempt ratio in recent history — a resounding 48.95 percent — in the 2013-14 season.
Penn and Cornell, who saw coaching changes in 2015 and 2016 respectively, have also stayed mostly above the mean in recent years. Dartmouth, who this year has one of the nation’s leading three-point shooting units led by Brendan Barry — NCAA’s most accurate shooter from deep — unsurprisingly pace the Ivies at 45.22 percent 3PA/FGA this season.
What does the Crimson think about its three-point shooting?
Harkening back to the reference to the Warriors, the Harvard team had a once-in-a-lifetime experience this past Sunday. Following a win over the Boston Celtics the prior night, Golden State decided to hold a practice inside Lavietes Pavilion, and Harvard’s student-athletes were invited to watch Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and more take shots underneath its own roof. Previously, Harvard had hosted the Sixers and Duke Basketball this past season.
Coach Tommy Amaker, who had actually been teammates with Warriors head coach Steve Kerr on the gold-medal 1986 World Championship team, joked with his compatriot that he had “messed up the world of basketball” with the Warriors' relentless ability to drain triples.
“I said everybody wants to play like you guys, but no one has the players that you have,” Amaker added.
However, the Harvard coach did acknowledge his team’s embracing of several core principles that has spurred the Warriors to three titles in the past four seasons.
“Ever since we’ve been here, we’ve played with great pace,” Amaker said. “Pacing and spacing is exactly what we’ve talked about for years. [Golden State] has taken it to a totally different level, but there are similarities in terms of ball movement, getting people off with touches, counting the number of passes a possession. That’s exactly some of the philosophical things that are exactly the same.”
For Harvard players, the explanation of the team’s record frequency of three-point shooting brought more surprise than affirmation, particularly in lieu of the Crimson seemingly depending on junior big Chris Lewis’ “inside-out” presence and Ivy-leading field goal efficiency numbers.
“I feel like how Chris [Lewis] played last year, teams are really keying in on him,” classmate Rob Baker said. “...Instead of being able to throw it inside to Lew[is] we sometimes skip it and attack the double team by shooting a wide-open three-pointer. As long as we knock them down I have no issues with it.”
“I don’t know if that’s because of the game and how it is evolving in general, but that’s nothing that has been intentional as far as jacking up threes,” junior guard Christian Juzang added.
Regardless, there is little argument that the triple will continue to be a lethal weapon for the team as opportunities will abound for wings such as junior Justin Bassey and first-year Noah Kirkwood as well as stretch fours including sophomore Danilo Djuricic and Baker, among other targets.
“When I get [three-point opportunities], I need to make sure I make it, because Bryce [Aiken] commands attention, Juzang commands attention, Chris [Lewis] commands attention,” Baker said. “When it is open, I just got to step up and knock it down.”
As this season progresses into the depths of the Ivy League campaign, expect the emphasis on three-point shooting to continue to play a significant factor in influencing wins and losses. Looking ahead, it will be intriguing to see whether these upward trends from long range continue to persist in both the professional game and in the Ivy League.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Southeastern Conference will boast a Crimson streak next year.
Senior standout wide receiver and return man Justice Shelton-Mosley is set to transfer to Vanderbilt University next season. Shelton-Mosley appeared in only four games in the fall before a serious leg injury ended his season, so he will be eligible for one more NCAA campaign under recently updated redshirt rules.
The three-year All-Ivy League first team selection will face off against football powerhouses including Georgia, LSU, Florida, and South Carolina in the famously formidable SEC. Ivy League transfers to the conference are hardly unprecedented — Vanderbilt snagged a lineman from Penn and a punter from Columbia last season.
“It’s objectively the toughest conference in college football,” the 2017 STATS FCS First Team All-American said of the SEC. “So many great players come out of there, and you also have legendary coaches. [Vanderbilt coach Derek] Mason is just a great person.”
Shelton-Mosley racked up a number of accolades over his three full seasons with the Crimson. A former Ivy League Rookie of the Year, the Sacramento, Calif., native finished his Harvard career with 148 receptions and 1,921 receiving yards — good for third and fifth, respectively — on the school’s all-time lists. The Academic All-Ivy selection also sits atop the Crimson record board in punt return and kick return averages.
Shelton-Mosley also praised the new, more lenient NCAA eligibility system, which is expected to allow more players to pursue transfers or redshirts in the future.
“I’m positive there will be probably more players that consider this route,” he said.
At least one other student-athlete will be following that path this year. Senior quarterback Tom Stewart declared recently that he will be extending his football career with a graduate transfer.
The play caller is headed to Rice University, where he will look to build on a 2018 season in which he took over the starting position in the latter half of the campaign. Stewart suffered a hip injury in the Crimson’s season finale against Yale, but before that disappointing coda came five multi-touchdown games, an Ivy League Co-Offensive Player of the Week nod, and an All-Ivy League honorable mention. 
The Dallas gunslinger’s best performance this year also was one in the history books. Against Columbia, he found paydirt five times, tying a Harvard record. One of those touchdown throws went to junior wideout Jack Cook for 92 yards and now stands as the longest touchdown pass in school history. Stewart totaled 393 passing yards in the contest.
Stewart did not see much game action in his first three seasons with the Crimson.
“My four years here from a football perspective didn’t go quite the way I wanted,” Stewart said. “Had some injuries and then, obviously, they kind of threw me into the fire this year. I feel like I still have a lot of football left in me. I was really hitting my stride at the end of the year, and I just want to keep pursuing that, chasing that dream, and play for as long as I can.”
Stewart, like Shelton-Mosley, spoke favorably of the NCAA’s policy changes to transfers and recruiting.
“They have this new transfer portal, and it means a ton of college guys, especially quarterbacks, switching schools, like Georgia to Ohio State, or Ohio State to Miami,” Stewart said.
The quarterback was contacted by a number of schools and ultimately chose Rice over the University of Richmond.
“Rice’s head coach was up in Boston visiting Justice [Shelton-Mosley], and I was able to meet him,” Stewart said. “I scheduled a visit with them this January and had a great time, decided Rice is the place for me. Division I football with some big games next year, great academic institution, and also my dad went there.”
And while Shelton-Mosley and Stewart are prepping for moves to the SEC and Conference USA, some of their teammates will be gearing up for a shot at the NFL. Among those eyeing the next level are defensive tackles Stone Hart and Richie Ryan, wide receiver Adam Scott, and offensive lineman Larry Allen, Jr., son of Hall of Fame lineman Larry Allen, Sr.
Senior running back Charlie Booker is reportedly also exploring transfer opportunities, per Stewart.

With all the shops and restaurants leaving the Square lately, &pizza and Milk Bar are some of the few shining new additions compared to a now deserted Urban Outfitters (R.I.P.). Located on Brattle Street right across from the Curious George store, this new restaurant and dessert stop combo is especially convenient for those of us living near the Yard. So, with the grand opening happening this Saturday, I got the chance to check out the Friends & Family Preview on Wednesday for a first look at this new combo store.
General Atmosphere: 9/10
With its fun, bright interior and windows all along the outside, this is great location to get away from the grey Cambridge winter while doing some Square people-watching. Anywhere inside could serve as the background for your next Insta post, and the lighting is perfect for taking some ~aesthetic~ foodie pictures. The music is bopping, the workers are friendly, and there’s seating for you and your squad, so really what more could you ask for? Plus, with Valentine’s Day coming up quick, this would be a great spot for a combined dinner and dessert date night (or the perfect place to eat lots of ice cream and act like that holiday doesn’t exist, your choice!).
Milk Bar: 7/10
I tried three items at the Milk Bar: the Crack Pie, the Boston Creme Pie Milkquake, and the Corn Cookie. The highlight of my Milk Bar experience was, without a doubt, the Crack Pie (which makes sense considering it’s one of their most popular items). Imagine basically eating a full stick of butter with an oatmeal cookie, and you can start to understand the nearly religious experience I had while eating this. The Boston Creme Pie Milkquake is unique to this new location, and although it didn’t taste as heavenly as the Crack Pie, it’s a great option for pretending like it’s still 70 degrees and sunny outside. While I was undecided on a third sweet to try, one worker highly recommended the Corn Cookie, saying it tasted like cornbread (which was music to my Southern ears). Admittedly, I would compare it more to a sugar cookie with a heavy smell of corn but hey, if that’s your thing then this is perfect for you. Despite the downfalls of the Corn Cookie, I give Milk Bar a 7/10 — just make sure you come with a big sweet tooth.
&pizza: 8/10
For my pizza taste testing, I got “The OG”, or your classic Margherita pizza. Each pizza can be customized to your liking with whatever sauces, cheeses, and toppings your heart desires, and you get to watch the whole (Instagrammable) process that only takes a few minutes. Depending on what you order, the pizza is definitely more on the minimalist side (aka, no gooey melted cheese to bite into), but with fresh ingredients and a great experience, earning an 8/10 from this pizza connoisseur.
Overall, with some great flavor and a fun, cheerful vibe, I give Milk Bar and &pizza a good 8/10. With so many changes to the Square over winter break, both are great new additions for anyone wanting something savory or sweet. Plus, with them being open until 2:00 a.m. on the weekends, they make for a great late night spot besides Jefe’s or Tasty Burger – that is, if you’re willing to wait in what are sure to be long lines of students also eager to try them. Be sure to check out both restaurants when they open at 11:00am on Saturday for giveaways, samples, and sweet treats (one dollar soft serve!).
