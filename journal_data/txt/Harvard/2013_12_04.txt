After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite living in L.A., I’ve only seen one famous person in my hometown, and it’s that guy from the Allstate commercials with the really deep voice. As anyone who follows me on Instagram knows, though, I’ve met plenty of famous people here in Cambridge and Boston, either through opportunities from The Crimson or aggressive stalking. Here are the most important life lessons they’ve taught me.
The Airborne Toxic Event: People around the world are surprisingly similar.
Lead singer Mikel Jollett said he noticed one constant when he was touring: “We’ve played all these different places. Some people love their kids. Some people love their dogs. They generally like each other. The people are the same.”
The Cast of “The Cabin in the Woods”: Be passionate about your job (like Joss Whedon).
Actor Kristen Connolly on working with director Joss Whedon: “He was just so excited. He’d be like, ‘Can we do it again? That was perfect, but let’s just do it again for fun.’”
Kristin Chenoweth: Don’t let rejection get to you.
The hilarious, pint-sized triple threat gave me this gem about dealing with rejection: “I call my friends up and dissect it to death.… Rejection is a part of my business and a part of life. Let yourself go get a Frosty. Spend the day being pissed. And then move the fuck on.”
Will Forte: Keep the people who care about you close and don’t let anyone take advantage of you.
In Forte’s newest movie, “Nebraska,” his character is confronted by a number of people who want part of his father’s fortune. When I asked him if there were any people like that in his life he said, “I have a wonderful family. I’m pretty good about picking my friends. There are [other] people in your life who try to take advantage of you and are one-sided friends. If you have friends like that, you can easily get rid of them.”
And finally:
Tina Fey: Your time is important—be respectful but assertive.
Tina Fey is one of my biggest role models. Was I disappointed when I met her my freshman year and wasn’t able to squeak out anything remotely resembling human speech? Yes. Was I also disappointed that the only words she said were, “Are you guys going to be in this too? Because I’m only gonna do this once,” to my friends after I stood next to her for a picture? Yes. But looking back, I can see it from her perspective. You owe it to yourself to demand what you think you deserve. No one else is going to do it for you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After yesterday’s report that the most frequently awarded grade by Harvard College is an A, the natural reaction will be to fault a blend of unwarranted grade inflation and lax teaching standards—implicitly assuming that the high grades are in no way the result of high-quality work but mostly, if not entirely, due to undeserved coddling of students.
The news came from the monthly meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, when Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris revealed that the median grade at the College is an A- and the most frequently given grade is a straight A.
That shouldn’t come as a complete surprise—admission to Harvard has become increasingly selective with each incoming class hailed as extraordinarily gifted. A commensurate gain in academic achievement should be more an expectation than a surprise. High grades could be an indicator of the rising quality of undergraduate work in the last few decades, due in part to the rising quality of the undergraduates themselves and a greater access to the tools and resources of academic work as a result of technological advances, rather than unwarranted grade inflation.
In the same way that directly comparing the price of a contemporary Cadillac to the $3,200 inflation-adjusted price tag of the original Model T would ignore the incredible gains in the quality of cars over the last 90 years, so too does comparing modern grades to the C average during the Eisenhower administration disregard significant differences in the College.
That’s not to say that this “grade compression” is not a legitimate concern that makes it harder to differentiate among students at the College. But that addresses the deeper question of what the purpose of grades is —whether grades should signify competence or comparison.  Before any action is undertaken this question needs to be answered by the University and the student body.
Establishing a rigid bell curve on grades or other equally clunky deflationary techniques would only make the already savagely competitive culture devolve into a Hobbesian environment. Furthermore, if there were already a problem of students self-selecting into easier classes, that pressure might strengthen with such policies and further stifle the culture of intellectual openness that is one of the most rewarding experiences for Harvard students.
Yearning for the halcyon days of depressed GPAs seems to miss the realities of a more economically diverse undergraduate student population that is more sensitive to the pressures of the modern job market. The post-recession mindset of students is already the source of much anxiety and to add the uneasiness of deflated grades would be unwise.
Even Princeton  is now considering a reversal on its policy that set a suggested cap on the number of A’s in order to lower GPAs. A recent study by researchers at the University of California-Berkeley provides evidence that employers are more likely to select applicants with a higher nominal GPA, even when presented with statistics on the difficulty of the school that the applicant attended.
While the unexpected frequency of high grades at Harvard may be somewhat jarring, there is not conclusive evidence that only grade inflation is to blame. In addressing this problem, Harvard should avoid making simple comparisons between the students in the Class of 2013 and its 1953 counterpart.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You’re sick? I’m sorry to hear that.”
I can almost guarantee you that you’ve heard some form of that line at least once in your life if you’ve been “unfortunate” enough to get sick. This apologetic response to a biological misdemeanor (“You need to take care of yourself!” is up there, too) has basically become the expected response after learning that someone is under the weather.
The definition of disease doesn’t help its villain status, either. According to Oxford Dictionaries, a disease is “a disorder of structure or function in a human, animal, or plant, especially one that produces specific signs or symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury.” In other words, a disease is something that’s wrong with the way your body is working, and, by extension, anything that is not right with your body. That’s a lot of weight to put on a word.
To be fair, being sick is anything but easy. When you’re sick, you’re fighting a lot of battles. Usually you’re quite fatigued, so you’re fighting a battle without your physical strength. The next stage involves sleeping a lot. Anyone who has slept with a fever can tell you that it’s not much fun: fever dreams are usually quite vivid and can leave you feeling confused and disoriented. Thus, you’re fighting a battle with your mental landscape, too. This combination of physical exhaustion and mental distress is sure to take a toll on your spirit, opening up a third front on the emotional side. In sum, it’s easy to say that it sucks to be sick.
But it’s being easy doesn’t mean that it’s correct. Contrary to popular belief, there are some clear benefits to being sick.
One involves getting to know yourself better. When you’re sick, you begin to understand how you handle problems that you can’t necessarily solve immediately. Do you take the “denial” approach, refusing to accept that you’re sick until something serious happens? Do you immediately become distraught and give in to your misery? Maybe you do some combination of the two? If you take some time to analyze how you deal with being sick, you can learn a lot about the way you handle issues that don’t have obvious solutions and save yourself a lot of time and trouble in the future.
That’s another thing that being sick gives you: time. In today’s society, breaks have become a luxury, one too expensive for some to afford (for mental or financial reasons). But being sick, almost ironically, removes you from the turbulence of the global economy and gives you time. Of course, this time is somewhat tainted, seeing as you’re probably suffering; but at least you have time to reflect on your life once you begin to recover, an invaluable emotional plus.
Indeed, perhaps the best thing about being sick is that you learn just how strong you are. The role of recovery is understated in society; there are few feelings as good as recovering from a low point. If we’d take the time to think about how difficult it is to fend off waves of microscopic organisms that want nothing more than to destroy our feeble little cells, we’d appreciate what we are capable of a lot more. Whenever I get better, I want to high five each and every helper T cell in my body for a job well done. Perhaps this is where we should direct our efforts in addressing the stigma against disease—getting sick is bad, but recovering makes it worth it.
Unfortunately, this argument doesn’t work for every illness. There are certain diseases that do not have cures. But even when disease leaves little room to consider the bright side, there is something to be said for maintaining a positive attitude. People with grave illnesses should be admired for their courage and strength. In refusing to let their handicaps drag them down, they inspire the rest of us, and make us all better.
Medically, the debate is still ongoing as to whether a positive attitude has a significant effect on a sick patient’s condition. But in the mean time, I’ll just stay optimistic. What do I have to lose?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
80 percent of students who voted in last week’s referenda voted “yes” on a questionasking whether Harvard University should advocate for comprehensive immigration reform. “Comprehensive immigration reform” refers to a federal plan to, among other things, provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented Americans—including the family members of the young adults who have already qualified for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which provides a means for undocumented students and veterans to reside in the country and find jobs without fear.
This referendum made sense for all the reasons stated by its sponsor, Harvard College Act on a DREAM. They argued in the UC’s “pro” statement that Harvard previously supported the DREAM Act, which has now become part of a larger comprehensive immigration bill; that “hundreds of colleges and universities throughout the country” already advocate for comprehensive immigration reform; that  “if immigration reform fails to pass this year, the 40 undocumented students currently at the college will be left with no legal avenue to adjust their immigration status.” Yet I still find it interesting that there was such a strong student consensus that Harvard should support comprehensive immigration reform—which might include spending money to lobby US Congress.
After all, what does it mean for our university to engage in lobbying?
Of course, Harvard is a political actor in many ways. Our university makes political statements through where it invests its massive endowment; it makes a political statement withits treatment of workers on campus; it makes a political statement with the research it funds and the faculty it hires. Yet it also quite literally spends between a quarter million and one-and-a-quarter million dollarseach year directly advocating for policy changes. Harvard’s top administrators, the Office of Federal Relations, hired lobbyists, and a contracted law firm all spend timelobbying the federal government and the state of Massachusetts on behalf of our university.
Harvard is certainly not the only university to engage in lobbying the federal government. Even in its highest-spending year recently, 2007, Harvard was outspent by both California State University and Johns Hopkins University. But Harvard’s huge endowment as well as its influence as a huge academic institution means that it can put a lot of economic and moral clout behind legislation that it cares about.
In the past, Harvard has justified its lobbying by saying that it advocates for causes connected to its mission of education and research. This is why, two years ago, President Faust travelled to Washington, DC along with an undocumented Harvard undergraduate to promote the DREAM Act—which would have protected dozens of Harvard students every year from the threat of deportation. Faust also repeatedly wroteletters to all representatives to US Congress whose districts include Harvard (includingSenators Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, John F. Kerry, and Scott Brown, and Representative Michael E. Capuano), publically advocating for the DREAM Act. According to OpenSecrets.org, which draws quarterly reports from the Senate Office of Public Records, Harvard listed the DREAM Act on its lobbying disclosure form in 2009, 2010, and 2012.
Many of the federal bills Harvard lobbies for have clear connections to the research and education mission of our university: they create pathways for highly-skilled immigrants to obtain visas, strive to reduce student loan interest rate hikes, and sustain the federal research funding that Harvard’s faculty relies on. Some of the bills Harvard support may be in our university’s interests even if they don’t align with the generally-liberal political values of Harvard’s students and faculty: For example, President Faust signed her name to a letter advocating against sequestration of science research funding that suggested instead that entitlement programs were “a primary source of long-term spending growth” that should be addressed in a deficit-reduction plan.
While Lawrence Lessig might warn against the increasing influence of money in Congress, I do believe that given the nature of today’s politics, Harvard’s million-dollar lobbying structure has the potential to do a lot of good. But, in an increasingly corporatized university, it can also be dangerous.How does Harvard decide what bills connect to its mission as a University? Essentially, this requires an act of deliberate boundary-drawing by Harvard, certainly a subjective process. What directly relates to education and research, what does not? What would it mean for Harvard to support bills deregulating workers’ rights, or bills decreasing endowment transparency?
There’s no strict standard behind what falls within Harvard’s purview and what does not—which leaves room for student advocacy to make a difference in what Harvard lobbies for. Harvard College Act on a Dream helped convince Faust to support the DREAM act four years ago. Hopefully, student advocacy will follow through on last week’s referendum on comprehensive immigration reform and Harvard will turn its lobbying power to this important issue, too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over Thanksgiving break, I read and fell in love with a translation of a novel by Aksel Sandemose called “A Fugitive Crosses His Tracks.” Alfred A. Knopf, now an imprint of Random House, published the novel in 1936. At the time, Sandemose’s reviewers compared him to Joyce, Céline, Rilke, and Kafka; though I find him to write much like Montaigne. That his work is obscure is all the more cognizable in light of his fall from such high praise. The novel might be better known under its Norwegian title, “En flyktning krysser sitt spor.”
I take the time to mention the original title because only Norwegian copies of the book are for sale; a hard-cover copy costs about $20, plus $30 for delivery to the US—in order to obtain a copy of one’s own. I was lucky in borrowing Widener’s copy, because I would otherwise never have had the pleasure of reading Sandemose. My appreciation for the book sent me on an historical investigation of its printing history that leads me to believe the novel might be an orphaned work.
An orphaned work is a work protected by copyright, but the holder of the copyright is either unknown or untraceable. In the case of Sandemose’s “Fugitive”, the work was copyrighted in 1936; under the 1909 copyright, works were copyrighted for 28 years with a possible renewal of 28 years. However, estimates suggest only 7 percent of books under copyright were renewed prior to 1964, when renewal of copyright became automatic.
Copyright law is complicated. I’ve emailed the Permissions Department of Random House to enquire after the status of the book. Perhaps the copyright was never renewed. It’s also possible the copyright was renewed and is still valid through the many acts of Congress passed since the mid-1970s that extended copyright protections for longer periods of time. And if the copyright is still valid, it might be held by the publisher, or held by the translator or his literary estate, or by another party altogether. I’ve still yet to hear from Random House; I don’t know what to expect as a response—anything is possible.
The complexity of copyright is a problem. Copyright, as conceived in 1790 in the first US Copyright Act, meant a term of protection from piracy of 14 years, with renewal for an additional 14 years; to receive the additional term, the copyright holder had to be alive. Simple. And from 1978 until now, copyright extends for the lifetime of the creator plus an additional 70 years after death. Also, simple. But what happens with works copyrighted between 1923 and 1978 is anything but simple—works could be in the public domain, could be orphaned, or could be in copyright for an additional 67 years after publication.
The confusion surrounding these works often prevents interested parties from making use of their content, thus thwarting the ultimate goal of copyright law—the promotion of “the progress of science and useful arts.”
Returning again to the example of Sandemose’s novel, if the copyright status was clear, the novel could perhaps return to print. The publisher could issue a reprint or sell the rights to another firm more interested in turning the text into a new edition or an e-book. Likewise, an organization like HathiTrust (a digital partnership of academic libraries, including Harvard’s) or Google Books could take their digitized copies, currently unavailable for reading but available for full-text search, and share the contents of the book with readers across the globe. As it stands, the book is out of print; there is no e-book other than the one held by HathiTrust; and there are no used booksellers I can find who have a copy on the market.
An opening of the digitized treasure troves of the world’s great libraries is on the horizon, and this November came steps closer to fruition when Google won the lawsuit brought by the Authors Guild; the court ruled book digitization an acceptable fair use practice, when used for preservation and indexing, not commercial activity. Libraries are on Google’s side, with the ALA coming out in support of the ruling—though the ALA does not represent the opinions of all librarians. The Google case was helped, in fact, by a similar case in which HathiTrust won against the Authors Guild on similar grounds of fair use.
I hope the expansion of the fair use doctrine established in these cases portends some change regarding the law governing orphaned works. A House bill in 2006 and a Senate bill in 2008 both failed to bring about change; they died in Congress and never got within inches of the President’s pen.
The US is falling behind other nations that share our common law heritage. Canada reformed its Copyright Act to add licensure for the use of orphaned works. Great Britain did the same in earlier this year through its Enterprise and Regulatory reform Act. Even the EU has already moved to grant public entities (including libraries) the freedom to make use of orphaned works for the public good. The US must take notice of these reforms and implement them to allow the use of orphaned works for the advancement of arts and science, for the continued innovation and growth in our economy.
Whether or not my new pet novel is in or out of copyright is ultimately unimportant. It’s just one of many works of uncertain legal status, another piece of evidence showing that the byzantine nature of copyright hampers the market, creates scarcity of intellectual property without benefitting authors, and chains up information that would rather be free.

The Harvard Coop will soon provide members with an immediate discount on purchases in place of the annual rebate the store has offered since 1882.
 
“The Coop is finalizing a shift to an upfront discount for paid-up members as opposed to a back-end rebate,” Coop President Jeremiah P. Murphy '73 wrote in an email to The Crimson.
 
This year, Coop members received rebate checks along with a note detailing that the discount will become effective at the start of fiscal year on June 29, 2014.
 
Murphy said that the change stems from the findings of extensive surveys, which suggested that Coop members would prefer to receive an upfront markdown rather than wait until the store determines rebates at the end of each year.
 
“We did some focus groups and what we really got out of those focus groups was that people really don’t know what they want the Coop to be in 10 years or 15 years,” said Cody R. Dean ’14, a member of the Coop Board of Directors. “But there were some small things that we could do to make it a little more relevant or a little more convenient without losing the tradition that the Coop has built for many hundreds of years now.”
 
Dean said that while the exact number has not been decided upon yet, the member discount will likely fall within the range of past rebate rates. However, while past rebate percentages have varied year to year, Dean said that the discount will likely be a fixed rate.
 
The member rebate has occupied a central role in the Coop’s structure since the organization’s founding in the late nineteenth century by a group of students and University professors who hoped to offer an alternative to the high prices offered elsewhere in Harvard Square.
 
As a cooperative society, the Coop is owned collectively by more than 55,000 members who purchase a $1 membership card in exchange for the value proposition historically offered in the form of the annual rebate.
 
Previous rebate percentages have reflected a number of factors including the economic climate, fluctuating between 0 and 8.9 percent since 1990 and most recently rising to 8.8 percent.
 
Due to the changing industry, the Coop has looked to revisit its role with the University and its members.
 
Murphy wrote that he believes an immediate reward will be more meaningful for members and will likely augment future membership numbers. He added that the Coop will issue a formal announcement to members once it finalizes the new discount program.
 
Dean said he views the policy switch as a means of reflecting the constant changes in the way students shop.
 
“We hope that it will attract people to shop at the Coop and maintain the institutional identity for students and alumni,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
In her freshman year, Angie Peng ’14 could barely run a mile. Whenever she attempted to go for a long jog, she said, she would stop whenever she got too tired. But joining Harvard On The Move, a University-wide program that encourages group exercise, helped changed that. Earlier this year, with three years of HOTM participation under her belt, Peng was able to complete her first marathon.
 
“The only reason I have been able to [run] is because there have been people running with me who distract me from how far I have run or how tired I am,” Peng said. “It is very hard to become a distance runner on your own.”
 
Like Peng, many Harvard community members said that staying fit and living a healthy lifestyle is no easy feat. With several commitments and activities to juggle, students said, exercise often falls low the list of priorities.
 
“Harvard is a brand new environment, and there are a lot of other appealing extracurriculars that compete for one's time here,” said Craig Rodgers, who founded the Harvard College Marathon Challenge in 2005. “So what are the first things that we tend to give up? Sleep and exercise.”
 
With the launch of HOTM in January 2011, Harvard has enhanced its promotion of exercise and health among the Cambridge community through programs that seek to offer exercise opportunities with others and is particularly for those who are not necessarily top-level athletes.
 
Director of the Harvard University Center for Wellness and Health Jeanne Mahon, who oversees Harvard On The Move, said that beyond community building, organizers hope that these programs “create an opportunity for the Harvard community to get outside and be more active.”
 
FROM BEGINNERS TO VETERANS
 
Contrary to their names, HOTM and HCMC recruit all members of the community to join their ranks, regardless of experience or skill.
 
“Despite the word ‘marathon’ in its title, HCMC is primarily not for marathoners,” Rodgers, who works as a psychologist for the Bureau of Study Counsel, said. “Rather, most people on the HCMC list typically run much shorter distances.”
 
HOTM participants have a wide range of physical abilities, from members who are just beginning to exercise consistently to more seasoned runners. Every year since 2006, a group HCMC participants have been selected to run the 26.2-mile Boston Marathon to benefit charity.
 
“It is a pretty wide spectrum. You have a bunch of marathoners who run really fast, and then you have people who are just running their first 5K,” said Peng, who is now a run leader for HOTM. “The benefit with that is wherever you are on that spectrum, you have someone who is running your pace, running your distance.”
 
HOTM run leaders inform students about upcoming runs through the groups and encourage students to attend. Through the program, participants earn points for the House Intramural program and can support the Houses in the Straus Cup standings.
 
RUN TOGETHER, STAY TOGETHER
 
Those interviewed said that the most appealing aspect of HOTM and HCMC is that they create communities to inspire healthy habits. Leaders from both HOTM and HCMC stressed the importance of community when discussing the success of their respective programs.
 
“I think [community] is important because most of the people who come on HOTM run recreationally,” said Jennifer Tu ‘16, who is a run leader for HOTM. “A lot of them didn’t do track and field during high school, and this is their way to connect with people in the community as well as have fun and keep fit.”
 
HOTM and HCMC serve to represent the importance of exercise by actively reminding the community that others are exercising as well, according to leaders of the organization. The HCMC mailing list has over 500 subscribers. Over the list, members post runs with their expected mileage, pace, and the location of where to meet. The list is also used to share running tips, such as where to run and what to wear.
 
“Some people who always prefer to run alone say they like being on the list just because it serves as a consistent reminder that others at Harvard are running, which in turn motivates them to keep running,” Rodgers said.
 
Peng added that the motivation to exercise comes not only from knowing that people are exercising, but also from exercising together.
 
“If you run for four hours by yourself it is miserable, at least for some people,” she said. “For group running, it is a lot easier to get into it. It is always easier to run with a buddy.”
 
GOING THE DISTANCE
 
While these programs have been around for a few years—with HOTM launched in January 2011 and HCMC founded in the fall of 2005—this year, they have made efforts to attract new members of the community, including both faculty and students alike.
 
According to walk leader, Kayla A. Hart, who is also a staff assistant at the Center for Wellness, the programs do not get as much publicity as they should. Organizers have been searching for new ways to reach members of the Harvard community.
 
“We have been trying to put ads on the main employee site and ads on different places on campus. We are definitely seeking to find more opportunities about that,” she said.
 
HOTM plans to find ways to attract students through fun events, such as the Hash Run that happened earlier this fall, where runners followed an unknown path by tracing a trail of baking flour left by a run leader, and the Halloween Run.
 
“We are just trying to do more events that will get people who aren’t intense marathoners interested,” Peng said. “We are also looking at sponsoring fun runs and races and things like that.”
 
Peng added that while the programs should actively recruit new members, they must also remember to retain their veterans.
 
“I think it is a fine line between doing fun new exciting things but keeping it consistent so people who do show up know to come on a regular basis,” she said.

Jody Diamond does not allow spectators at her weekly Gamelan rehearsals. If you come, you play.
 
Held in the Student Organization Center at Hilles every Tuesday at 6:30 p.m., Gamelan lessons take place in a small room decorated with bright orange and blue percussion instruments, as well as an assortment of drums, painted mallets, and a couple of large gongs in the back corner.
 
Gamelan, pronounced jam-eh-lan, is a traditional instrumental ensemble from Indonesia that boasts a small but vibrant community at Harvard. The ensemble, led by Harvard artist-in-residence Jody Diamond, is composed of students, musicians, and local residents.
 
Players are instructed to discard their shoes in a pile in the corner and take their seats on small stacks of blue cushions. At this Tuesday’s rehearsal, Diamond’s white poodle Lily was in attendance and ambled among the instruments.
 
Once warmed up, the players, separated by percussion instruments on all four sides, begin to harmonize. Although gamelan music relies on a basic skeletal structure, the core of its appeal lies in improvisation. Beginning and ending with a certain contour of notes, gamelan music moves not so much around pitch and rhythm as around the contour of how the notes flow.
 
T. Brandon Evans, a second year film and visual studies Ph.D. student at Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, has been playing gamelan for a year, and said that he finds it the perfect way to relax.
 
“Once you understand the contour, you just feel the vibration,” Evans said. “You’re able to relax and just play.”
 
As a researcher of theories of sound, Evans also said he finds gamelan an interesting way to reverse conceptions of time. Because gamelan rhythm is punctuated by the intermittent strikes of the gong and the tenong—a xylophone-like percussion instrument with triangular keys—players draw their timing not from measured beats but from listening to the ensemble as a whole.
 
Diamond, who has been playing gamelan since 1970, said she loves this fluid notion of time and the culturally specific way of listening that gamelan teaches.
 
“Playing gamelan offers a different way for us to hear time, to connect with each other, and to uncover feelings that we didn’t know existed before,” Diamond said. “It’s a totally new way of relating and discovering.”
 
Diamond believes that the appeal of the gamelan, especially at Harvard, is that unlike other activities, gamelan affords students the freedom to be a total beginner and to make mistakes.
 
“We didn’t grow up hearing music this way,” Diamond said. “We’re like little children. Learning the gamelan is like watching yourself learn English as a baby. That’s why I fell in love.”

Julie Orringer, a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, spoke on the ability of novels to convey truths through fiction in a lecture delivered Tuesday at the Knafel Center. During the lecture, titled “Lies that Tell the Truth: Story and History in the Novel,” Orringer discussed the ways in which writers blend history with their own speculation and inventions into a cohesive story.
 
Orringer, author of the novel “The Invisible Bridge” and the short story collection “How to Breathe Underwater,” joined the Radcliffe Institute this year to research an upcoming historical fiction novel about Varian Fry ’30, a Harvard student and journalist who traveled to Marseilles in 1940 to save Jewish writers blacklisted by the Gestapo.
 
At the lecture, Lizabeth Cohen, dean of the Radcliffe Institute, introduced Orringer’s previous works and her current research.
 
“With such an accurate presentation of history, it grew impossible for me to detect the line between historical fact and the fiction created in Julie’s imagination,” Cohen said of Orringer’s historical fiction novel, “The Invisible Bridge.”
 
Orringer began her lecture by discussing the known history and sources on Fry, whose Harvard files were recently released by the University. In 1945, Fry published a memoir of his experiences assisting Jews in Marseilles .A number of biographies already have been written on Fry.
 
Given this abundance of source material, Orringer posed the question of why she wrote a novel as opposed to a history.
 
“I guess I’ve been interested for a long time in the ways writers interlace real and fictional stories,” Orringer said. “How we study and transform the past for the purpose of writing stories and novels, and how that tension between history, speculation, and pure invention can lend energy to a piece of work, not just for the writer, but for the reader.”
 
Orringer elaborated on this marriage of history and fiction by discussing the ways in which other authors took liberties in writing novels about characters and events that were rooted in reality.
 
She discussed Jeffrey K. Eugenides’ novel “Middlesex,” which placed a hermaphroditic protagonist in the city and setting that the author grew up in, and Philip M. Roth’s novel “The Plot Against America,” which described an alternative history in which aviator Charles Lindbergh won the 1940 presidential election. Orringer posited that both novels arrived at “deeper truths” by blending history and reality with creative departure.
 
The lecture was part of the annual Julia S. Phelps Annual Lecture in the Arts and Humanities lecture series to honor Julia S. Phelps, an instructor at Radcliffe who died in 2002.

An unpublished study conducted by Berkman Center fellow Jerome Hergueux suggests that reciprocity and social image are the most significant social motivations for new volunteers who contribute to public goods, such as Wikipedia.
 
Hergueux presented his findings of a study that explored why people voluntarily contribute to public goods during Tuesday’s installment of the Berkman Luncheon series. According to Hergueux, his study is the first comprehensive test that applies a variety of theories on the topic to real life examples.
 
During the course of his research, Hergueux took particular interest in Wikipedia, which stands as a paradigm of the “collaborative model,” wherein production is mainly based on voluntary contributions. The model stands in contrast to “incentivized firm production,” wherein people are compensated for their work.
 
Hergueux said that he believes there are “social preferences that can push people to contribute to those public goods.” In his study, he examined social motivations such as altruism, reciprocity, and social image in determining why and how much volunteers contribute to public goods.
 
The study coupled experiments and observational data. Hergueux recruited Wikipedia contributors to participate in various experiments that tested social preferences. He then studied the relationship between volunteers’ social motivations and their number of contributions.
 
Wikipedia contributors were divided into three categories—new users, engaged users, and administrators. Hergueux found that altruism played an insignificant role in predicting contribution level for all types of contributors.
 
While Hergueux said that reciprocity and social image “appear as the underlying social motives” in the transition from a new to engaged contributor, reciprocity did not help explain the continuing contributions from those already engaged in Wikipedia.
 
The category of administrators referred to users who police Wikipedia pages and remove disruptive users. Hergueux said that social image did help predict administrator activity, but that administrators were less likely to have a preference for reciprocity. The study found that the less trust administrators had for strangers, the more likely they were to actively police pages.
 
Attendee Doug O’Flaherty, a product manager at Open Source Digital Voting Foundation, said that the study “reveals real underlying social motivation…from a depth of understanding that is not possible” other than from statistical analysis.
 Hergueux noted that the study is still in progress and more data needs to be collected. After the event, O’Flaherty commented that the study will be useful for businesses looking to use the collaborative model.

Thomas F. Burke, the chief of the Division of Global Health and Human Rights at Massachusetts General Hospital, argued that the greatest inequality on earth is health care for women in poor countries during a talk at Ticknor Lounge on Tuesday.
 
Burke spoke to a crowd of about 30 students on the importance of men’s roles in women’s health during the presentation, which was advertised as “Be a Man in Maternal Health.”
 
The event was chiefly organized by the Harvard Undergraduate Maternal Health Initiative and was co-sponsored by the Sigma Chi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternities, the South Asian Men's Collective, Asian American Brotherhood, Black Men's Forum, and Harvard University Global Health Forum.
 
During his presentation, Burke argued that significant inequities remained between women in affluent nations and women in poorer nations. He said that girls in certain underprivileged nations statistically face a one-in-six chance of dying of pregnancy-related causes in their lifetimes, whereas the corresponding statistic in the United States is one-in-18,000.
 
Burke also explained some of the ways in which his division at MGH has been involved in tackling maternal health issues in less privileged nations. According to Burke, 2.6 million women are disabled every year by postpartum hemorrhage.
 
“These are all preventable deaths, and they almost all happen in poor women,” Burke said.
 
To tackle the widespread effects of postpartum hemorrhage, Burke said his department has been involved in creating a low-cost solution, a reusable Uterine Balloon Tamponade treatment that can be offered at a cost of $4.85 per unit in underprivileged nations.
 
“This four eighty-five can save many, many lives,” Burke said.
 
Burke expanded his focus to the importance of financial and entrepreneurial involvement in maternal health issues. He called for business, cultural, and regional collaboration to incite change in the maternal medical community. 
 
“Science has shown us that investing in women and in girls has an enormous economic return, an enormous social return,” Burke said. “This return allows for lifting families and communities out of poverty.”
 
HUHMI was co-founded last fall by its current president Michelle J. Wang ’14 and advocacy and outreach co-director Eunice Kim ’15. Regarding the motivations to start the group, Wang said there was a lack of specific interest in maternal health on campus. 
 
Last spring, HUMHI organized a week to raise awareness surrounding topics in maternal health. In the future, Dylan V. Neel ’15, the group’s research and development co-director, said HUHMI hopes to continue its advocacy work by reaching out to groups at the Harvard Innovation Lab to achieve a more entrepreneurial focus.

The number of biology concentrators at Harvard College has risen by 44 percent in the last decade, a sizeable increase when compared to Yale, Stanford, and Princeton, according to a review of the life sciences concentration cluster. The review was presented at the monthly meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Tuesday afternoon.
 
The report is the first major evaluation of the life sciences concentration since the formation of the Life Sciences cluster in 2006, when the two existing life sciences departments—Biology and Chemistry—were reorganized into nine distinct concentrations.
 
“This represents a cross-departmental discussion...within the life sciences that really got started in 2004,” chairman of the Board of Life Sciences Concentrations Robert A. Lue said of the review at Tuesday’s meeting.
 
In 2005, life sciences faculty also began implementing a new set of advising procedures and significantly reworking introductory courses such as Life Sciences 1a and Life Sciences 1b.
 
“We wanted an opportunity...to address what we thought were some standing problems that we thought were evident in student advising,” Lue added.
 
Student interest and satisfaction have both increased since the restructuring of concentrations and advising within the life sciences. In 2012, the life sciences concentrations graduated 52 percent more students than in 2006. Concentration satisfaction—a major concern before the restructuring—has also risen significantly, according to the report.
 
“Bio majors were always the least satisfied in [satisfaction] surveys [before 2006],” Lue said at the meeting. “The college has improved its student satisfaction ratings across a broad range...and Life Sciences is now in many parameters above the college.”
 
The review attributes the life sciences’ increased ratings to a number of factors, including the employment of Ph.D.-level advisors and more opportunities for research inside and outside the classroom. The number of life sciences concentrators who participate in research for credit has risen across all nine concentrations, and the number of thesis writers has also grown.
 
The establishment of foundational courses like Life Sciences 1a and Life Sciences 1b, whose enrollments have risen by more than 20 percent between the 2006-2007 and 2011-2012 academic years, also has contributed to greater interest among students, according to the review. Lue said at Tuesday’s meeting that the restructured foundational courses were meant to appeal to a wide range of undergraduates, including non-science concentrators.
 
“We decided that there was no difference, at the foundational level, of what a future life scientist needs and what a future poet needs,” Lue said.
 
According to the report, Harvard has proportionally more underrepresented minority concentrators in the life sciences than minority representation in the student body at large, a trend that runs counter to national statistics showing fewer underrepresented minorities graduating with biology degrees.
 
The review was one of three docketed items at Tuesday’s meeting, which included a discussion of HarvardX led by Peter Bol, vice provost of advancements in learning. Perhaps the most timely business of the meeting—given the approaching exam period—came when Jay M. Harris, dean of undergraduate education, said that the median grade at Harvard College is A- and the most awarded mark is A.

With next year’s UC vice presidential seat soon to be vacant, three of the four candidates who lost their presidential or vice presidential bids last month say they are uncertain of whether they will pursue the position.
After Samuel B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15—two UC outsiders and this year’s joke ticket—won the UC presidential election last month, they immediately pledged to resign as soon as possible. However, on Monday night, Mayopoulos reversed his position, saying he would not be resigning after all and instead assume the presidency. Mayopoulos’s move vacates the vice presidential seat, which will be filled in an internal UC election on Dec. 8 in which, theoretically, any College student could be elected.
When asked about that seat, former UC presidential and vice presidential running mates C.C. Gong ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15, who placed a close second in the election, expressed uncertainty about their future plans. Former presidential candidate Chika-Dike O. Nwokike ’15, who placed third in the election, said that he was also unsure of whether or not he will run for UC Vice President, but that he is leaving open the possibility.
In an email, Gong wrote, “nothing has been decided yet, and we're each reflecting upon our goals and what we hope to accomplish to understand what we should do moving forward.”
On the other hand, Nwokike’s former vice presidential running mate Una Kim ’15 was more certain about her plans, saying she will definitely not be running for the position.
Kim also added that, regardless of whomever ends up vying for the position, she believes that the Gong-Gofford pair has already been reaching out to UC reps regarding the upcoming election and that either one of them will be elected the new vice president.
Mather Representative Manik R. Kuchroo ’16 said that the meeting might create some tension within the UC. Prior to Mayopoulos’ public announcement, Goffard said Mayopoulos informed him at lunch on Monday of his intention to serve in his newly elected position. However, both Nwokike and Kim said that they were not informed of Mayopoulos’ decision prior to reading the article in The Crimson.
Gong was not available to comment on whether she knew before The Crimson article that Mayopoulos would no longer resign.
Despite the uncertainty over who will serve as the UC vice president, both Gong and Nwokike said that they anticipate a positive relationship between Mayopoulos and the to-be elected Council vice president.
“I definitely don’t think this will stifle any creativity or initiatives the Council is working on,” Nwokike said.
Observers also reflected on the unusual nature of the Dec. 8 upcoming internal election, which all agreed will necessarily play out far differently than typical elections.
“What would ordinarily take place over the course of a few weeks is going to have to take place during the course of a single UC general meeting,” Quincy Representative Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 said. “That includes people declaring their candidacy, advocating for themselves, and trying to earn the support of the voters who in this case are the representatives of the Undergraduate Council.”
Referring to the exclusivity of the UC internal election, Tim R. Hwang ’08, who ran for president under a joke ticket during the 2006 presidential election, advocated for an election of a vice president by the students, regardless of UC constitutional laws.
“I think it doesn’t make sense to have a smoke-filled room of UC representatives choosing a new vice president,” Hwang said.
Though UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said that Mayopoulos has every right to claim the vice president position as his, this year’s election results indicate that the student body continues to have doubts regarding the Council’s efficacy. However, she added that those concerns are raised in every UC presidential election.
“I think certainly there’s a healthy skepticism on campus of the role of the UC and the efficacy of the UC, and I hope that those are questions that are continued to be asked now and into the future,” Raghuveer said. “I’m happy that the election is a great opportunity for the school to collectively reflect on those questions once a year.”
While Mayopoulos’ change of course will present new challenges for the UC, several students interviewed by The Crimson expressed their support for Mayopoulos’ decision to not resign.
“Since they were elected, both of them deserve a shot at [the positions],” Devon Guinn ’17 said.
Meanwhile, Clark formally confirmed to The Crimson on Tuesday afternoon that he still intends to resign from UC presidency once he is inaugurated during the Dec. 8 UC general meeting, effectively ensuring that Mayopoulos will assume Clark’s position shortly after being inaugurated as UC vice president.
“I’m really excited for it,” Clark said of the prospect of Mayopoulos leading the Council. “I think he’s going to do a tremendous job.”

China’s Hainan Airlines will offer non-stop flights between Boston and Beijing starting in June 2014, an announcement expected to benefit Cambridge’s tourism industry and Chinese students at area colleges.
Hainan Airlines will initially offer four flights per week, as reported by the Boston Globe earlier this week. Even without non-stop flights to Logan International Airport, Boston already receives an impressive number of Chinese tourists.
“What the impact [of the new flight] will be is just a much stronger stream of Chinese travelers,” said Evan Saunders, the CEO of Attract China—a company that helps businesses across the country build their presence in the Chinese travel industry.
The flight will boost the economies of Boston and Cambridge, as Saunders noted that Chinese visitors to America spend more money than any other tourist demographic.
Attract China has worked with the Harvard Square Business Association and individual businesses, such the Coop to increase their appeal to Chinese travelers. The company has also contributed to The Charles Hotel’s increased efforts to accommodate a growing Chinese clientele.
Saunders said he expects that Boston and Cambridge businesses will continue such existing programs and aim to improve their visibility in the Chinese market to cater to the new wave of tourists.
“I think businesses don’t need to change much. What they just need to show is that they’re there and they offer a product that the Chinese want,” he said.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the HSBA, wrote in an email to The Crimson that the HSBA is excited about the new, non-stop service and ready to welcome a greater amount of Chinese tourists.
“Our businesses are always on their game; an influx of new visitors will mean they’ll step it up again,” she wrote.
Additionally, the new direct flight between Boston and Beijing will provide college students from China with a more convenient means of traveling to and from their homes.
Diana Zhu ’16 said that although she flies out of Shanghai, she is glad to have the new option of flying from Shanghai to Beijing and then directly to Boston.
Yet Zhu acknowledged that while the non-stop service may attract more tourists to Boston, she believes that the transfer-free flight will have little impact on the number of Chinese students choosing to study in America.
“I think the major drive for people coming to the U.S. to study is fundamentally the education here,” she said. “A flight can make it more convenient, but I don’t think it will be a fundamental drive for people to come to Boston to study.”

After traveling over 4,500 miles to play its last game, the Harvard men’s basketball team’s (7-1) Wednesday tilt against Northeastern (2-5) will provide a change of pace. Instead of connecting on different airlines, the team simply has to transfer T lines as it renews its cross-town rivalry with the Huskies.
Harvard comes into the game on a three-game winning streak after winning the Great Alaska Shootout. Led by juniors Wesley Saunders (14.3 ppg, 4.7 apg) and Steve Moundou-Missi (12.7 ppg, 8.3 rpg), the team won each of its tournament games by an average of nearly 14 points. Saunders was named the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player.
“I think we are learning to piece together all the pieces on our team,” senior Laurent Rivard said. “We have learned to play together really well and we are extremely unselfish. We want to win the Ivy League and make a run in the tournament and to do that you have to be unselfish. It cannot be about the points, but [rather] about the team.”
The Huskies come into the game on a season-long three-game slide, with two of the losses to teams hovering just outside of the Associated Press Top 25. Both of the losses, to Florida State (62-60) and VCU (79-66), came away from home, where the Huskies are 1-4 on the year. Overall, Wednesday’s game will only be the Huskies’ third at home all season.
Northeastern is led by junior forward Scott Eatherton, who has five double-doubles on the season and averages just over 16 points and 10 rebounds a game. Against Florida State, Eatherton nearly single-handedly willed the team to victory with 21 points, 15 rebounds, and two blocks.
However, while Eatherton anchors the interior of a defense that has held opponents to just 44 percent shooting from the floor, Northeastern’s matches up poorly to Harvard’s offensive strengths.
The Huskies allow opponents to shoot 36 percent from behind the arc and give up 14 free throws a game. On the year, the Crimson has shot nearly 77 percent from the line. Although the team has struggled so far from three, it returns the core of a team that shot nearly 40 percent from distance last season.
There are recent signs that Harvard and, in particular, its most prolific shooter, are getting back on track. Over the weekend, Rivard—a career 40-percent shooter—knocked down five triples in back-to-back games, becoming Harvard’s all-time leader in made three-point shots.
Rivard, who attempted only one shot against Denver, said that Harvard adjusted its offense to the opponent. Against Denver, the team repeatedly went inside to Moundou-Missi, who finished with 20 points. In each of the next two games, the senior said, defenses sagged off of him and he took full advantage, launching a dozen three-pointers a game.
“We adapted to the defense,” Rivard said. “Denver played a matchup zone so it was tough to get shots on the perimeter, so we mostly shot inside. Against Green Bay, their perimeter guys let me shoot and in those two games, we moved the ball better. Overall, we are just running the same offense. We can play it inside and if they pack it in we can shoot from outside.”
The team’s defense performed as well as its offense, holding the Horned Frogs to 25-percent shooting from the floor, the second time this year that the Crimson has held its opponent under 30-percent shooting from the floor, both times setting records for the Amaker era.
The Crimson will be going for its eighth win in nine games against Northeastern, looking to tie its best start ever under Amaker. Two years ago, led by Keith Wright ’12 and Oliver McNally ’12, the team started 8-1 with a win at the early-season Battle for Atlantis tournament. That team finished with a 26-5 record and became the first team in Harvard history to make the NCAA tournament, falling in the first round to a Vanderbilt team that sent three players to the NBA.
“We are similar [to that team] in the sense that we got momentum from the preseason tournament,” Rivard said. “We are happy with the way we played but we still need to work on some other [parts of our game].”

They motivate the team. They lead the squad in victory, as well as defeat. They are the role model players look to for advice when they are on the field.
All of these descriptions define a coach. But of equal importantance, they define a good captain.
At the end-of-season football banquet on November 25, junior defensive back Norman Hayes was named the 141st captain of the Harvard football team for the 2014 season. He replaces the current captain, senior linebacker Josh Boyd.
“This is simply amazing,” said Hayes at the banquet. “History, tradition, and leadership all come to mind when I think of this incredible honor.”
Hayes represents an addition to the growing list of defensive captains. There hasn’t been an offensive captain since quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 in the 2004 season, and the past three seasons have seen linebackers filling the leadership position.
“He has to be the guy who brings the energy, attitude and leadership day after day after day,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said in an email.
“A good captain has to be willing to challenge his teammates and hold them to the same high standard he holds himself, and that is a trait that makes many players uncomfortable.”
Football captains are elected by fellow teammates each year. After the final game of the season, the players all get together and vote for the captain for the following season.
According to junior quarterback Conner Hempel, Hayes was an easy choice.
“Obviously you have to be a good player, but I think that’s kind of a given,” Hempel said. “The most important thing for a captain is they have to be a good face for the football team. I think Norman Hayes really is a perfect candidate for our captain because not only is he a good football player, but he is also an outstanding person and a great person to be the face of our football team.”
Murphy agrees that Hayes is the perfect man for the job.
“Norman is a natural leader by example with a great work ethic, energy, and attitude,” Murphy said.  “It doesn’t hurt that he is a great player and the most physical defensive back in the Ivy League. Beyond that, he has tremendous leadership charisma, and his energy and enthusiasm rub off on his teammates.”
The Harvard football team has a tradition of electing a single captain, something that sets them apart from most programs. Hayes admits to being quite surprised when he was told of his new position leading the team.
“I’m so humbled by the thought that so many of my teammates see in me things to be expected of the captain of the Harvard Crimson football team,” Hayes said at the banquet.
The Tucker, Georgia native was named to the All-Ivy first team this season as well as the College Sports Madness All-Ivy first team. In his sophomore campaign, Hayes made the second team All-Ivy roster.
Hayes tied for third in the Ivy League this season with three forced fumbles. He ranked third on the Crimson with 56 tackles and tied for first with two interceptions.
By applying consistent pressure on defense, Hayes put Harvard in a position for victory in many games this season. Facing Yale, Hayes stripped wide receiver Candler Rich during a first half Bulldog drive, allowing the Crimson to recover the fumble and score on the ensuing trek down the field. He also had key interceptions in the San Diego and Brown wins that allowed Harvard to clinch early-season victories.
Hayes will follow in the footsteps of Boyd, who served as captain this past fall. Since Hayes was named to the position, Boyd has given him some advice on assuming the role.
“He said to just remain who I am,” Hayes said. “Don’t change anything. I was elected captain for a reason. They want me to be that leader for them.”
Finishing with a 9-1 record, the Crimson earned a share of the Ivy League title. The team’s lone loss came in triple-overtime at the hands of Princeton.
The 2013 campaign has just come to a close, but Hayes is looking forward to next season with high hopes. Although he said they haven’t set out any specific models for success in planning for the future, the ultimate goal is a perfect 10-0 season.
“I can’t wait to get out there again this next season and bring back to Cambridge another Ivy League title,” Hayes said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Ross Friedman’s 15 years of playing soccer, the jerseys, the coaches, the lineups, and the stadiums have all changed, but one thing has remained constant. For almost a decade and a half, Ross has been able to look into the stands and see his father cheering him on.
Tod Friedman has been to almost every game since his son started playing at the age of six. From the youth leagues to international competition, Tod has been there for nearly every single tick of the clock while Ross was on the field.
“At the very beginning, a lot of my friends thought I was a little overboard, going to all of Ross’s games when he was just a little kid,” Tod said.  “But now that they have kids in college and beyond, I think they have a newfound respect for me. They can understand where I was coming from.”
For a man so committed to his son’s athletic career, Tod has barely any background in sports at all. He admits he was the complete opposite of a sports fan before his own children got involved in athletics.
“I’m not too coordinated of a person,” Tod said. “I never played any sports. The only reason I’m into soccer is because my son is into soccer.”
Despite this lack of personal experience on the field, Ross still thinks of his dad as one of his most valuable resources as an athlete.
“It’s kind of funny,” Ross said. “My dad doesn’t know too much about soccer, but he knows a lot about competition. Seeing all these games, it’s been pretty interesting for him.  It puts a different perspective on things, and how to handle a win or a loss. His insight on the game means a lot.”
Tod has elected to be there every step of the way for Ross, whether his games were down the street or across the ocean.
“He’s gone all over the world to watch me play,” Ross said. “He travelled to Bolivia for a tournament, he came to Jerusalem to watch me play in the Maccabi games… Whatever means it takes, he’ll do it to come see me play.”
Over the past four years, Tod’s most frequent travel destination, however, has been Soldiers Field.
During the fall semester, he travels between six and eight hours round trip, on a weekly basis, from the Friedmans’ home in Columbus, Ohio to Cambridge.
In his four years as a defender for Harvard’s soccer team, Ross has played in 68 games. Of these 68 games, Tod has missed less than 10.
“He’d stay in my room,” Ross said. “I’ve got a futon for him and a bed set that he’d stay on. Sometimes he would just hang out while I studied. He’s always understood that Harvard doesn’t make exceptions for any student.”
For Ross’s dad, every single one of these moments was special.
“For me, it has really been about being there for the whole process,” Tod said. “From him getting ready for the game, to taking the field, it’s an amazing time I’ve gotten to spend with him.”
Knowing that a friendly face would always be in the crowd was a positive force for the entire team. Every game, the players could count on seeing Mr. Friedman cheering them on throughout wthe contest, and supporting them after each game win or lose.
“The guys on the team know him really well,” Ross said. “When he’s outside the locker room after games, it’s expected. It’s a pretty cool experience, and great to have him there with us throughout the fall semester.”
The handful of times that Tod has been unable to make it out to see Ross and the Crimson play, he still managed to be there in some capacity.
“When he couldn’t make it to games, he’d be live streaming them,” Ross said.  “In some way, he’s watched every single one of my games.”
Ross’s final season was the winningest since 2009 for the Crimson, as the squad picked up five conference victories and seven wins overall, finishing second in the Ancient Eight after finishing last Ross’s junior year.
Moving the ball around all season long, Ross finished with an Ivy League-best 10 assists in his senior campaign.
Having witnessed the team’s journey for the past four years, no one understood the importance of this quite like Tod Friedman.
“I’m so grateful that Ross had the opportunity to find success at the collegiate level,” Tod said. “I’ve seen the team transform 180 degrees in terms of teamwork, process, and seeing the results.”
Besides losing one of its most valuable players when Ross graduates this May, Harvard will also be losing one of its most dedicated fans.Although it may be the end of an era for one team, it’s the start of a new journey for the father-son duo.
“I will miss the college games,” Tod said. “But I’m hoping that the fun continues at the professional level, and that I continue to get to see him play. But in the end, whatever he elects to do, I will be 100-percent supportive and encourage him all the way through.”

In Kimye news unrelated to that motorcycle humpfest, it seems Kim Kardashian may have decided that her next step towards world domination involves enrolling at Harvard.
Rumor has it (and, to be clear, this is definitely still in the rumor stage) that Kim was inspired by the “very Harry Potter” feel of the campus following her soon-to-be hubby’s recent visit here, even though she spent most of her time in the cinderblock beauty that is the Graduate School of Design.
But don’t worry about being caught on the Keeping Up With the Kardashians camera as you attend your 10 a.m. lecture in your pajamas; we're guessing that if Kim did enroll, it would not be at the College. Only time will tell whether Kim pulls a Tyra or a Hilary, or forgets about Harvard altogether. After all, she's got bigger things to think about and even more historically important buildings to make a scene in.

UPDATED: Dec. 4, 2013 at 8:07 p.m.You may have hopes of studying efficiently, eating well, exercising frequently and not going insane, but we all know that as soon as you click on that first Buzzfeed list, things go downhill and before you know it four hours and all hopes of a productive day fall to the wayside (don't worry, you're probably going to get an A anyway). Flyby has come up with two reading period pie charts detailing the expectations vs. realities of reading period.

On Tuesday, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris stated that the median grade at Harvard College is an A-, prompting commentators the world over to criticize the perceived leniency of the College's grading standards. But this is not the first time such an outcry has occurred, nor is it likely to be the last. Below, Flyby presents a collection of news stories on grade inflation at Harvard over the years, from The Crimson’s archives.
 
May 14, 1975: Grade Inflation—Life Without Ds 
“If you give a student too high a grade, it leads to kind of corruption...which is bad for him,” says professor of Government Harvey C. Mansfield.
 
Last June, over 82 per cent of Harvard undergraduates had achieved a cumulative course grade average of B- or better. In June 1969, only about 70 percent fared so well. Deeply concerned by the "high rate of increase" in Harvard grade-point averages, Henry A. Rosovsky, dean of the Faculty, brought the problem to the attention of the Faculty in November, calling for quick remedial action. Rosovsky pointed out that despite a decline in their SAT scores, Harvard students were receiving higher and higher grades. For whatever reasons, it was becoming obvious that more and more "A"s were being given out; many course curves had shifted rapidly upward until they reached a point at which there were virtually no grades below C.
 
October 29, 1976: CUE Hears Plan to Curb Grade Hike 
The Committee on Undergraduate Education (CUE) yesterday considered a proposal that essentially would combat grade inflation by including with each student's grade on his transcript the number of students enrolled in the course and the median grade.
 
Francis M. Pipkin, chairman of the committee and assistant dean of the Faculty, yesterday introduced the proposal which he said met with unsympathetic response from faculty and student members of the group.
 
A letter outlining the proposal sent from Richard Diamond '76 to Dean Rosovsky, provoked the CUE to consider the recommendation.
 
June 10, 1993: Debating Grade Inflation 
The longstanding debate over grade inflation re-emerged at the beginning of this year, in the academic pages of the Chronicle of Higher Education and an internal memo from Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education Lawrence Buell to faculty members.
 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Thomson Professor of Government Harvey C. Mansfield Jr. '53 quickly entered the debate. Known as "C Minus" to his students, the high-profile crusader against grade inflation was a natural to comment on the question.
 
In a January 14 interview with The Crimson, Mansfield attributed students' improving marks to affirmative action in the early 1970s.
 
"I think at that time professors were unwilling to give a C to a Black," he said to The Crimson.
 
December 13, 1994: Fight Against Grade Inflation Has Little Support 
Although administrators have said that Harvard should be a leader in the fight against grade inflation, the Committee on Undergraduate Education has yet to take definite steps against the trend of rising grades.
 
Harvard's inaction comes in the wake of recent decisions at Stanford University and Dartmouth College to address the issue.
 
"Stanford has acted and Dartmouth has acted," Kenan Professor of Government Harvey C. Mansfield Jr. '53 said yesterday. "It's time for us to get off our duffs."
 
The average Harvard grade now floats between a B+ and an A-.
June 5, 1997: Grade Inflation Becomes an Educational Fact of College Life
Gone are the days of the Harvard "gentleman's C."
 
"A C is a flunking grade now," says President Emeritus Derek C. Bok.
 
Much like inflation in the economy, grade inflation is a phenomenon that Faculty and
students at the College seem to accept as an inevitable fact of life.
 
"In an ideal world, you probably wouldn't have it," says former Dean of the College L. Fred Jewett '57.
 
Over the last few decades, the Faculty has done little to curb grade inflation, often attributing the better marks to the increased quality of students entering Harvard in recent decades.
 
June 6, 2002: Faculty Tries To Combat Grade Inflation 
Though the problem of grade inflation has been a perennial one for Harvard, it dominated the Faculty’s agenda this year, resulting in unprecedented changes that many hope will buttress the integrity of Harvard’s name.
 
The effort to curb grade inflation gained sweeping momentum this past November, a month after a feature in the Boston Globe called Harvard’s grading practices “the laughing stock of the Ivy League.”
 
The Globe story—which was picked up by news media nationwide—focused on the 91 percent of Harvard students who graduated with honors in 2001 compared to 51 percent of Yale and 44 percent of Princeton graduates. It also noted that half the grades awarded at Harvard last year were A-range grades.
 
After seven months filled with scores of reports and negotiations, on May 21 the Harvard Faculty did what seemed unlikely only a few months earlier—agreed.
 
May 9, 2007: Report: Grade Inflation Persists 
Over half of the grades awarded to undergraduates last academic year were As or A-minuses, according to data released by Dean of the College Benedict H. Gross ’71.
 
The percentage of “A” grades awarded in 2005-2006 did not increase significantly from the previous year, when 48.8 percent of grades were As or A-minuses.
 
But the percentage of A-range grades has risen considerably over the past two decades: only a third of grades were As or A-minuses in the 1985-1986 academic year.
 
The mean of all grades awarded—which is not the same as the mean of all student grade point averages—for the 2005-2006 academic year was 3.45, and the median was 3.67.

 Just before finals week, the Harvard undergrad population is met with great news: everyone’s getting A’s! At least, that’s how some panicky students may have interpreted Dean Harris’s recent remarks—leading to a wave of despair washing over campus. Here are seven ways that simple statement ruined mornings across Harvard today:

1. The student that impressed her family with that 3.8 average, is now discovering that this average is, in fact, pretty average.
 
 2. The student that attributed the 60 on his math midterm to Harvard’s high  standards, is now conflicted as to whether he should feel especially bad about the grade, or impressed that he somehow managed to perform that poorly.
 
 3. The grad school applicant who, in addition to writing 18 essays and stressing over standardized tests, must now invent some kind of justification for all those unforgivable A-’s.
 
 4. The student who, after being made fun of by non-Harvardians for going to such a nerdy college, is now being made fun of by this same group for going to such an easy school.
 
 5. The student with unfortunate timing, who opened the Crimson breaking news email about Harris's statement after staying up all night finishing her last p-set and realized that even if she gets an A on it, it will be meaningless.
 
 
 6. The student who does not yet know that his professor, upon hearing the news, privately resolved to grade the upcoming final on a bell curve.
 7. The student who legitimately is a genius and cannot be differentiated by the Harvard grading scale; it didn't ruin her day.
