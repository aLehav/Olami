After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Disparities in education, race, and wealth are exacerbated in times of crisis.
Our mother and her eight sisters emigrated from Tanzania. They grew up in a small two-bedroom apartment where the concept of social distancing would have been both unimaginable and unfathomable. Scenarios like hers, which are ultimately breeding grounds for COVID-19, are a reality in varying degrees for many people.
The COVID-19 pandemic has already pinpointed and will likely worsen existing flaws within society.
Who will be able to work from home while still making enough money to pay the bills? Who will be able to transition to virtual learning overnight? Who will be able to avoid crowded buses and trains?
What about individuals in industries like construction who are less able to work remotely? What about the Uber driver who is constantly exposing himself for the sake of bringing home dinner for his children?
What does it mean to stay home if you are homeless? What does it mean for recovery groups to socially distance themselves?
Social distancing is strongly encouraged as well as legally enforced in some countries in order to “flatten the curve” and mitigate the transmission of the virus. One facet of social distancing involves working from home. In a Time magazine article, Alana B. Semuels ’01 discusses how “the spread of the coronavirus exposes a widening chasm in the U.S. economy between college-educated workers, whose jobs can be done from anywhere on a computer, and less-educated workers who increasingly find themselves in jobs that require human contact.”
Many industries are also segregated by race, education, and income, so working from home will not be a reality for many people from vulnerable populations. For example, giant tech companies were among the first to transition to a work-from-home model. But according to statistics published by Recruiting Innovation, black and Hispanic people comprise only one to three percent of the tech sector.
So even though every person will be impacted as businesses are forced to close and the economy dwindles, the impact will not be spread equally. Sandy Darity, an economist at Duke University, emphasizes that in economic crises, “Everyone loses work, but people of color lose more of them. This time it seems the job losses will be really severe for some, while others are called upon to possibly put themselves at greater risk.”
It is easy to urge protocols like social distancing from a seat of privilege. But the harsh truth is that the most vulnerable in our society will not be able to self-quarantine and maintain a standard of living, while keeping up with the demands of life. The spread of COVID-19 will disseminate faster in poorer communities, with often highly dense living situations, than in wealthier ones.
In overcrowded and underfunded places like prisons and homeless shelters, even the simplest hygiene technique such as handwashing is not as simple or accessible as it seems. Prisons and homeless shelters are operating at maximum capacity and do not have the means to practice social distancing, putting their populations at great risk.
In order to combat the rapid spread of the virus, homeless shelters in California are attempting to relocate individuals facing homelessness to motels. Prisons in New York have suspended visitation hours, and some are turning to measures such as freeing inmates in order to reduce the spread. Furthermore, many states have ordered all non-essential businesses, such as coffee shops and libraries, to shut down — so individuals facing homelessness who are not living in shelters will face even higher barriers to accessing sanitation facilities they previously utilized.
By no means are we underestimating the importance of social distancing and public health measures that are being put into place. These measures are necessary to ensure the health and safety of individuals. It is imperative to implement social policies to address barriers faced by marginalized populations, such as accessibility of hygiene, diagnostic testing, child care support, and emergency meals. Federal lawmakers have a moral obligation to innovate policies that address these vulnerable populations.
Fortunately, these daunting times have also demonstrated the strength of uniting as a community. From a petition to help those facing homelessness in the Boston area relocate into Harvard dorms to translations of COVID-19 information for non-English speaking communities, it is important to be aware of and try to contribute to grassroots movements that can aid these vulnerable populations.
Think beyond your situation. Think about the insufficiency of healthcare resources and how these resources are rationed based on inequities. Think about how these public protective measures may actually cause some individuals to struggle even more. Although COVID-19 possesses the capacity of infecting any human, vulnerable individuals from marginalized populations are going to be disproportionately impacted. The social and economic impact of this virus will be felt even more by those who are already marginalized — those who are segregated by education, race, and wealth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Often smuggled into modern introductory courses in normative ethics, the “trolley problem” is an infamous thought experiment that originated in the writings of philosopher Philippa R. Foot. A simple rundown — no pun intended — of the moral dilemma is as follows. Fatefully, you are the driver of a runaway tram that will strike and kill five people unless you redirect it onto another track where it will kill only one workman. Morally speaking, what ought you do?
Another version of the trolley problem takes place in the surgery room. Imagine that you are a doctor who can kill a healthy patient to obtain his body parts and save several other patients from dying. Should you kill the healthy patient or spare him? What is the right answer, if any?
The trolley problem and its variations concern problems of moral justification. What sorts of justificatory moral principles — be they consequentialist or deontological — yield the verdicts that appear to satisfy our moral commitments? How ought we choose among a number of competing moral principles?
In a recent tweet, Michael H. Schur, the creator of the philosophical fantasy-comedy television series “The Good Place,” wrote, “[The global COVID-19 pandemic] is basically the Trolley Problem, and [President Donald J. Trump] is taking the worst possible approach.” The global COVID-19 pandemic can be read as another variation of Foot’s thought experiment. Involving trade-offs and conflicting moral decisions, the current COVID-19 situation reflects a worldwide triage problem on multiple fronts.
In hospitals and care-centers, medical professionals confront hard questions concerning bioethics and distributive justice. Given the shortage of medical resources, what moral principles ought to be used to prioritize prospective patients? One interpretation of act-utilitarianism contends that saving the most number of lives is what makes an action morally right. However, strictly adhering to such a moral framework could leave a large number of patients unjustly precluded from medical care on the basis of arbitrary factors beyond control.
Medical rationing mechanisms in many states almost all lend preferential treatment to otherwise healthy people who are likely to fully recover. On the flip side, older people, individuals with mental and physical disabilities, and victims with chronic medical problems — all of whom are equally deserving of proper medical care — could be denied adequate medical attention. The dilemma grows more thorns when also considering identity markers such as race and socioeconomic status, provided that many low-income people and people of color are unable to afford top-notch treatments on a regular basis to stay in good health.
On the national level, a number of difficult questions concerning lockdown policy are at stake. Over 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment last week, a figure that is predicted to rise as nearly 90 percent of Americans have fallen under the shadow of lockdown orders. Some analysts have encouraged the use of models weighing costs and benefits to the economy and human lives in order to govern policy-making. However, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, to whom Schur replied in his tweet, responded by declaring, “We will not put a dollar figure on human life,” and “we’re not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable.”
Others claim that the long-term economic shutdown, impoverishment, and despair could be graver than the direct toll of the virus itself. No longer is this a trade-off between lives and money, but a choice between lives and lives. As in the Trolley Problem, there is no simple, uncontroversial answer.
In present circumstances, public officials across the world, especially Trump, must not back away from these difficult moral dilemmas posed by COVID-19. Jumping out of the proverbial trolley and abdicating responsibility is not an option. Those who have the power to decide which lives to save ought to make decisions in good faith, weighing ethical — not merely practical — considerations on both sides and remaining fully cognizant of the morally weighty trade-offs that result from their choices.
Many important moral decisions trickle down to the level of the individual. As trolley operators, we make daily choices on whether to engage in needlessly selfish and morally cruel behavior, such as hoarding vital resources for the purpose of price gouging and profiteering, or to save lives by practicing social distancing and lending a hand of support to those most in need. Trolley operators at all levels should take the helm of the trolley and engage in honest decision-making. As we wash our hands, more than ever, we must not wash away our moral convictions.
To turn or not to turn the trolley, we must now decide.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Ivy League will not change its policies to allow graduate students to compete in varsity athletics despite the spring athletic season being cut short due to coronavirus, the athletic conference ruled Thursday afternoon.
The decision comes following the National Collegiate Athletics Association’s Monday decision to restore one season of competition for athletes whose seasons were shortened.
Per the Ivy League’s ruling, Harvard spring season athletes who were eligible during the 2020 season would have to transfer to another university to use their additional year of eligibility, according to League spokesperson Matthew J. Panto.
As coronavirus concerns grew throughout March, the NCAA and its members took a series of steps to cancel all athletics, including winter sports championships and the remainder of the spring sports season. On Monday, the NCAA officially adopted its earlier statement that an additional year of eligibility would be “appropriate” for spring athletes. The association's policy gave schools autonomy to decide what form of relief the eligibility would take.
Panto explained the Ivy League’s decision on Thursday in an emailed statement.
“After a number of discussions surrounding the current circumstances, the Ivy League has decided the League's existing eligibility policies will remain in place, including its longstanding practice that athletic opportunities are for undergraduates,” he wrote.
Ivy League rules differ from other Division I schools on the issue of eligibility. NCAA policies state Division I athletes may compete in four seasons within the span of five years, opening the door for some graduate students to compete.
In contrast, Harvard and the rest of the Ivy League limit student-athletes to four seasons of competition within four years of undergraduate matriculation, except in certain cases of medical hardship, according to the Harvard student athlete handbook.
As a result, Harvard athletes will not be able to use their eligibility relief at Harvard, though athletes at Division I schools outside the Ivy League may use their extra year of competition at their current school.
Harvard Athletics spokesperson Timothy J. Williamson said the department did not have any additional comment.
Harvard baseball player Grant H. Stone ’20 said he was not surprised by the league’s decision.
“We weren't really expecting to have that opportunity,” he said. “I'm sure that we were all hoping for them to roll out the red carpet for us, but obviously, there was a very low chance of that happening.”
Stone, who was benched by shoulder injuries while on the team, said he entered his name into a database for transfer student-athletes and hopes to play baseball at another school while earning a graduate degree.
“I am not ready for my baseball career to be over yet. I personally feel like I have a lot more to give baseball wise,” he said. “I'm a guy who’s been injured on and off for the better part of my college career.”
Stone said he hopes that, by this time next year, he will be playing baseball and pursuing a graduate degree at an academically rigorous and athletically competitive university.
“That’s a perfect world for me, but there’s still a lot to be figured out,” he said.
Stone’s teammate, Kieran K. Shaw ’20, who also wants to take advantage of his eligibility relief, said he is exploring where he can play baseball next year. Though regular application deadlines for most graduate schools have passed, Shaw said he is confident he can find a school for the 2020-2021 academic year.
“All the schools that I've talked to thus far, they haven't expressed that I would not be able to attend the university because I missed the deadline,” he said.
Shaw, who had previously waffled between using his additional year or entering the draft for Major League Baseball, said he is excited to continue his collegiate baseball career.
“I think it's amazing that the NCAA came out with the official vote saying that every spring sport athlete deserves another year of eligibility. I think that's really doing right by the student athletes,” he said.
Harvard baseball player Chad N. Minato ’20, who learned about the Ivy League’s decision over social media, said he is waiting to hear from Harvard, who has been silent on the issue.
“We can't know if the decision at this point is finalized. The only thing is if it was finalized, then we would have liked to have heard directly from them,” he said. “But I mean I trust that if we haven't heard directly from them then there are definitely details I think that are still being worked on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard told affiliates to vacate campus last month to mitigate coronavirus spread, the University’s custodians were among the few who stayed behind, reporting to work to clean and sanitize University buildings.
But some members of the custodial staff who still remain on the nearly empty campus say Harvard has left them ill-prepared on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Fifty-two Harvard affiliates have tested positive for COVID-19 — among them multiple Harvard custodians, according to Roxana Rivera, the vice president of branch 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, which represents custodial staff.
“Some cleaners have tested positive for the virus, underscoring why it is so important that Harvard continue to work with us to protect frontline workers,” Rivera wrote in an emailed statement.
In recent weeks, Harvard’s support for employees during the pandemic has come under scrutiny, with security guards and dining workers raising concerns over the University’s emergency pay and benefits system. On Friday afternoon, Harvard guaranteed regular compensation and benefits through May 28 to all University employees who cannot perform their regular job duties.
Many Harvard custodians have not faced work stoppages, and some say they lack access to proper personal protective equipment — putting them at risk of catching the virus.
Custodian Doris Reina-Landaverde told NBC News last week that she started experiencing COVID-19 symptoms after the custodial staff’s supply of personal protective equipment ran out.
Maren R. Ceja, a custodian who works at William James Hall, said in an interview with The Crimson that she and her coworkers have also been repeatedly denied proper safety equipment.
“When I saw Doris's story on Twitter, that's when we kind of were like, okay, we're not the only ones that feel these frustrations of how they're dealing with everything,” she said. “When everything started, nothing was really said, no masks were given to us to protect us. The supervisor was very nonchalant with everything.”
Ceja said she approached her manager and asked him to purchase extra supplies. She felt his response was indifferent and dismissive.
“He just said, you know what, as custodians, that's just a risk that you'll have to take,” Ceja said. “They just treat us like we're disposable — they don't care about us, about our health.”
The supervisor, Carlos D. Vielmann, did not respond to a request for comment.
Ceja’s sister — Stephanie Velasquez-Ceja, another custodian at William James Hall — said she felt anxious about the situation.
“It kind of gave me an anxiety attack,” she said. “Everybody was leaving, and they were going to close the building, nobody else was going to come in. Why not just let it disinfect and leave? They’re just keeping us there until more and more people start showing symptoms.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard gives each custodian “appropriate” personal protective equipment, including nitrile gloves, to perform their cleaning and disinfection duties. When Harvard receives a request for cleaning in a space where a person has been sick with any type of illness, the custodians also receive face masks, goggles, and other equipment, according to Newton.
Newton added that custodians receive training on how to properly put on and take off the equipment and on how to safely clean facilities where coronavirus may be present and that the University’s protocols are in line with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control.
“Our custodial management team is also conducting regular reviews of how our workplace policies are being implemented to identify any potential issues,” Newton wrote. “We want all custodians to know that if they have any concerns about COVID-19, they can discuss their situation with their supervisor or Harvard Human Resources.”
Alex Cruz, a custodian at Northwest Labs, said that since the pandemic began, his duties have been reduced from cleaning entire buildings to wiping down bathrooms. He also said that after he was moved to a new building without receiving ID card access to it, he had to work in close proximity with a colleague, despite federal guidelines encouraging social distancing.
“I can't get in the building, I can't access any elevators, I can't even clean any of my areas — I have to work with somebody else because I need them to open doors for me,” Cruz said.
According to the University’s advanced sick leave policy, if custodians choose to take time off for COVID-19-related concerns, they must use their own personal sick time, or in the event that they do not have enough, they may use up to 14 unearned sick days.
Cruz said because he is a relatively new hire at the University, he is hesitant to use his limited sick time.
“Some of us are new with no sick time, some of us can’t afford to lose sick time as they were meant for something else. If we don't show up we have been threatened with being fired,” he wrote in an email.
Rivera wrote that the union remains “in frequent contact” with its members as well as Harvard administrators to ensure supervisors are protecting workers’ health and safety and the University “rolls out its leave policy in the fairest and safest way possible.”
“Every time our members raise concerns, we investigate and expect Harvard to make any necessary improvements in their policies, safety protocols, and worker protections,” Rivera wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the coronavirus continues to spread, the Cambridge Police Department is working to minimize officers’ exposure to the pathogen and prioritize the safety of people who may be experiencing domestic abuse during the ongoing statewide stay-at-home advisory.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick said Tuesday that the department has been “ahead of the curve” in taking health precautions against COVID-19. It converted non-emergency operations to a telephone hotline beginning about two weeks ago, and it is closely coordinating field responses with Cambridge Fire and EMS services.
“For a lot of calls that are not crimes in progress, in which someone wants to file a report with an officer and with the department, we're doing that over the phone now,” Warnick said. “So we have set up a room in which we have at minimum three officers working — a supervisor and two officers — at all times 24/7.”
While CPD has not yet reported a positive coronavirus test, other police forces across the country have seen droves of officers sidelined due to COVID-19. Over 1,400 New York City Police Department officers, for instance, have already tested positive for the virus.
In emergency scenarios, dispatchers have focused on more thorough “vetting” of callers’ health conditions so that first responders know whether to wear personal protection equipment.
CPD has also coordinated emergency service duties with Cambridge Fire Department and Pro EMS, the city’s local ambulance provider, to ensure officers are only responding to the scene when they are needed. According to Warnick, CPD has deferred a “large sum” of medical calls to CFD and Pro EMS over the last few weeks.
While CPD has brought many of its operations indoors, Warnick said these measures have not affected police presence in Cambridge. Instead of running its usual schedule of four shifts per day, CPD is deploying officers in two 12-hour shifts to offer its officers more flexibility.
“What that does is that allows us to have an increased bandwidth in the event that a number of officers are sick, need to be quarantined because of exposure, need to attend to personal matters because of the virus, whatever it may be,” Warnick said. “So we essentially have a more robust shift per shift now.”
During these longer shifts, officers have continued to operate as usual, wearing high-visibility uniforms to alert people of their presence and donning masks when engaging with the public at close distances, according to Warnick.
He added that in light of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s stay-at-home advisory, CPD officers will verbally engage Cambridge residents to disband large gatherings, but will not issue citations to offenders. Other police forces across the country, such as in New Jersey, have begun issuing citations and even arresting citizens for non-compliance.
“It’s an advisory, not something enforceable,” Warnick said of Massachusetts’s notice. “But really, the city's been really responsive to that in terms of taking down nets and taking off rims and locking playgrounds, that type of thing. So it's made it a little bit easier from a police perspective, but we are not issuing any sort of citations.”
With so many residents staying at home, CPD anticipates its officers will respond to more domestic violence cases, he said.
On Wednesday, the CPD Domestic Violence Unit released a statement on its website acknowledging the challenges that shelter-in-place and social distancing guidelines pose for people who have experienced domestic violence. The statement also provided a list of domestic violence resources.
The website states that department members are working extended hours to provide emergency response for “active incidents of domestic abuse” as well as “after the fact follow-up support services.”
Sarah Gyorog — executive director of Transition House, a Cambridge-based domestic violence shelter — said CPD’s domestic violence unit has been in close contact with her shelter to provide up-to-date resources.
“Our community team has been working with the domestic violence advocate there at the Cambridge Police Department to keep a running list of resources,” she said on Wednesday. “They're actually reaching out to all contacts and updating it on a daily basis.”
Gyorog added that these communications are crucial during the stay-at-home advisory as people experiencing abuse find it increasingly difficult to navigate domestic life.
“People who are experiencing an abusive relationship, they’re doing something that people on the outside might not realize: they're continuously safety planning,” she explained. “And a lot of the outlets for that safety planning are limited now with coronavirus.”
“So without any of those opportunities to get away, it's creating a much more high-pressure situation at home,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the novel coronavirus pandemic has uprooted the lives of many faculty working on campus this year — forcing them to switch to remote teaching and ramp down laboratory research — it has also disrupted the work of many faculty currently on leave.
A few said they have stayed relatively insulated from the turmoil, but many acknowledged the virus has significantly altered expectations for what they could accomplish during a year off from teaching.
For faculty previously planning to conduct research abroad, the pandemic has thrown a wrench into plans.
Arunabh Ghosh, an associate professor in the History department, wrote in an email that he was originally planning to spend his sabbatical year collecting archival and library materials in China for his research, but it is no longer possible to do so. He spent the fall as a visiting fellow at NYU Shanghai, but has not been able to return to China this semester, as his previous plans — including two months as a visiting fellow at Fudan University in China — have been canceled due to the pandemic.
“Under the circumstances, I have taken to going through the materials I did collect in the fall, and doing as much secondary reading related to my projects as possible,” he wrote. “The hope is that after I take stock, I’ll be able to start work on a chapter or two of the new book.”
Ghosh added that he has still been able to help some graduate students prepare for their upcoming qualifying exams over Skype.
History professor Sugata Bose wrote in an email that the pandemic disrupted his plans to research and write an upcoming book in Asia over the summer. He is instead working at home with the research he had already conducted, and proofreading some other projects.
“I am gathering together the research notes I already have to make some progress with writing chapters of the book,” Bose wrote. “I have never missed my Widener study more, now that I have to stay away from it.”
Some professors who rely on source materials in the United States have also faced barriers to continuing their research, on top of the psychological toll they are weathering amid the crisis.
English professor Deidre S. Lynch wrote in an email that she traveled to Canada to be with her elderly parents, leaving behind many of the print resources she has at home.
“I could fit only one box of books into the car,” Lynch wrote. “Ever since I have been feeling a little frustrated by the limits of my library.”
Art, Film, and Visual Studies associate professor Laura A. Frahm — a Scholar in Residence at the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles this academic year — said that she no longer has access to the archival sources for which the Institute is well-known.
“The pandemic has put a halt on all materials that we were supposed to be able to go through,” Frahm said. “Basically, this year is cut short and we have to work with the materials that we gathered so far.”
Frahm said that the book she is writing will probably be delayed, as she likely cannot continue her research at the Getty Institute until summer 2021. She added that this delay could prove “troubling" given her status as a tenure-track faculty member at Harvard. The one-year extension on the tenure review clock that Harvard has offered to her and others, though, will be “incredibly helpful,” she said.
English lecturer Laura van den Berg said that while she does not rely on physical materials to continue working on the novel she is composing, the pandemic has made it difficult to find the “mental space and clarity” to write.
Van den Berg added that she has “no doubt” the pandemic will shape her novel — which is set in the world of women’s amateur boxing — even in an “abstract way.”
“I think it would be very difficult for the pandemic to not leave its mark on whatever I’m working on right now,” she said.
Such challenges have not been impacted all research unifornmly uniform across all faculty, however — others on leave said they are grateful their work has not faced significant setbacks so far.
AFVS senior lecturer Ruth S. Lingford — an animator — said she is currently staying with family in London and finishing up a film she has been working on for a few years.
“All I’m doing now is the donkey work, frame-by-frame drawing — which normally would probably drive me crazy, but actually, it’s exactly what you need for this time because it’s kind of purposeful, but you don’t need an awful lot of thought,” Lingford said.
However, Lingford said she is concerned about her ability to return to work at Harvard in the fall. She was expecting to return on an H-1B visa, which allows foreign citizens to work in “specialty occupations," but United States Citizen and Immigration Services has temporarily suspended its expedited processing service for many visas due to coronavirus spread.
History professor Daniel L. Smail also said he has been able to continue his work largely uninterrupted as he continues the “write-up phase” of his book — though he acknowledged this was a luxury.
“What this means is that although there are books and other print resources which I can’t consult at the moment, the writing itself is largely unaffected,” he said.
“But that’s just because my children have grown up and left the house,” Smail added. “Friends and colleagues on leave with younger children are losing everything because of the need to do homeschooling and generally to look after their children.”
Smail added that many of his colleagues at other universities have been “scrambling” to put together online course materials, as their institutions may have limited online library resources. In an effort to help some of them, he put together a translation of a primary source about the Black Death and posted it online with an accompanying lesson plan.
History professor James T. Kloppenberg wrote in an email that he is grateful he can largely continue his research — which focuses on American and European political thought — using materials he already owns, as well as online sources.
“Compared with the many scholars who depend on their laboratories or on archives — for whom I have great sympathy — I have been able to keep doing my own work without too much trouble,” he wrote. “I realize that I am very lucky to be one of a tiny minority of faculty members able to continue my research and writing with so little disruption.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School professors tracking the ongoing coronavirus pandemic say it has already negatively impacted business operations at every level.
Though it is too early to determine the economic implications of the pandemic, professors say many small businesses will likely prove unable to weather the crisis.
In a blog post, Business School professor Willy C. Shih wrote that “service industries that have seen their revenues dry up” have become “the biggest losers from the coronavirus” in the business world. The hotel, airline, and travel industries, among others, are losing revenue that they may not be able to recover, according to Shih.
Business School professor Karen G. Mills ’75 said small businesses play a “critical part” in the U.S. economy, noting that “this part of the economy is under extreme duress because of the virus.”
Many small businesses have very low cash reserves, and a prolonged crisis threatens to permanently close many such businesses, according to Mills. In fact, Mills said, the average small business’s cash buffer could only sustain it for 27 days.
The macroeconomic consequences of the coronavirus have been dire, with the head of the International Monetary Fund declaring that the global economy has entered a recession and is unlikely to recover until at least 2021.
State and federal policymakers have tried to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the American economy. Last week, Congress passed a $2 trillion relief package that included approximately $350 billion for small business loans.
“If we can get this bill implemented quickly, then it could provide some relief,” Mills said.
Despite the economic devastation, businesses should prioritize health and safety amid the pandemic, according to Mills and Business School professor Rosabeth M. Kanter.
“Anything a company does for safety is a really wise investment because, otherwise, there isn’t going to be anybody that comes to work,” Kanter said.
Despite the economic downturn, several Business School professors identified a few possible benefits that could come out of the pandemic.
Professor Ryan W. Buell said the pandemic has made clear the importance of having “thoughtful and innovative” human resource policies in place that protect workers financially and psychologically “both in the worst of times and the best of times.”
“I think that the silver lining could be that there’s a lot of chances for leaders of organizations to better understand and appreciate these interconnections between their workers and customers, Buell said.
Business School professor emeritus Michael Beer wrote in a blog post that corporate managers can use the crisis as an opportunity to improve communication and workplace culture.
“The coronavirus challenge, like any crisis, provides senior management a huge opportunity to develop a trust-based culture rapidly,” Beer wrote.
Kanter also said she hopes the pandemic will shine a light on societal disparities and prompt business leaders and others to address them.
“My hope is that this will make clear the importance of leadership and leadership for service to others,” she said.

The University-owned Harvard Square Hotel has opened its doors to medical workers and first responders as a place to stay near local healthcare facilities as they help fight the novel coronavirus.
The University is offering the hotel — which sits on Mount Auburn Street in Harvard Square — to local healthcare provider Cambridge Health Alliance, as well as city police, fire, and emergency medical services as a place for front-line workers to stay.
“We hope these can help alleviate some of the burden and anxiety that those on the front lines of this pandemic are currently facing,” Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp wrote in an emailed statement.
Harvard Square Hotel has 73 guest bedrooms, the least expensive of which normally sell for $169 per night, according to the hotel website. Cambridge Health Alliance personnel are operating the facility, and the University will continue to provide cleaning services during the day.
“We very much appreciate Harvard’s support for the city’s efforts to confront this crisis,” Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale wrote in a statement. “Having unfettered access to all the rooms at the Harvard Square Hotel will allow our health care workers and first responders a safe place to stay in close proximity to our emergency facilities.”
“It alleviates stress for both our frontline workers and their families during a very anxious time for everyone involved,” he added.
Several Cambridge Health Alliance facilities are within a two-mile radius of the hotel.
The announcement comes as the total number of coronavirus infections in Massachusetts increases by about 16 percent per day. Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 said Thursday that he expects the hospitalizations due to the virus to peak later this month.
There have been 119 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in Cambridge since March 6. One city resident has died due from the disease.
Sharing the hotel property is one of several ways Harvard says it is trying to help to mitigate the coronavirus pandemic. Some students have called on the University to do more; one petition asks it to use now-empty dorms to house Cambridge residents experiencing homelessness.
“We’ve also offered the use of various lots and open space on our campus — particularly locations that are easily accessible — to help support health care operations,” Lapp wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In light of shrinking undergraduate applicant pools, admissions to a majority of Ivy League schools were less competitive for the Class of 2024 than in recent years.
Harvard announced last week that it admitted 4.92 percent of applicants to the Class of 2024 — the first percentage increase in six years. MIT and four other Ivy League schools also reported increased acceptance rates, while Princeton reported a slight decrease. Columbia and Cornell have not publicly released their admissions statistics.
Harvard saw a seven percent decrease in applications for the Class of 2024 relative to the previous class; Princeton and Brown were the only Ivy League schools whose applicant pools grew.
Of the eight Ivy League schools, Dartmouth experienced the largest increase in its acceptance rate — from 7.9 percent last year to 8.8 percent this year. The University of Pennsylvania and Yale followed, with increases from 7.44 to 8.07 percent and 5.91 to 6.54 percent, respectively. Brown’s rate grew from 6.6 to 6.9 percent. MIT saw an increase as well, with its acceptance rate rising from 6.7 to 7.3 percent.
The swelling admission rates mark the first break in a recent trend downward at Harvard and peer universities.
Brian Taylor — managing director of private college consulting service Ivy Coach — said the schools have seen higher acceptance rates in light of smaller applicant pools across the board this year.
“They still have to fill around the same class sizes overall. So when you have fewer applications — just basic math — you’re going to have higher acceptance rates,” Taylor said. “But I would say that this year, in particular, they also accepted more students because they couldn’t predict their yield as accurately as they could in previous years.”
Taylor added that higher acceptance rates — as well as secondary factors, such as admitted student weekend cancellations due to the coronavirus pandemic — will change how colleges draw from their waiting lists this year.
“Schools which are notoriously insecure about their yield will admit more kids. And they’ll also offer longer waitlists,” Taylor said. “This year, I anticipate that schools will go deeper into their waitlist than in prior years.”
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said he was uncertain about how current events could impact how many students are admitted from the waiting list.
“It is truly impossible to know in any year. It would be the most difficult year in our history, you know, to try to make any kind of a guess,” Fitzsimmons said. “We do stand ready for whatever might happen but there are lots of unanswerable questions.”
Anna Ivey — the founder of the college admissions consulting firm Ivey Consulting — said she believes it will be hard for admissions offices to accurately project yield rates amid the pandemic.
“All the tools that they normally use to predict enrollment are gone. Those are not valid anymore,” Ivey said.
“I suspect there’ll be a lot of movement this summer, and then who knows if you guys are going to be back on campus in the fall,” she added.

International Harvard undergraduates could face uncertainty around travel, visa compliance, and immigration issues amid the coronavirus pandemic, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in a March 28 interview.
“Just recently in the past week or so there have been changes in at least what the possibilities would be for someone being able to enter the United States. So that’s another big issue,” Fitzsimmons said. “But there are all kinds of complexities about visas beyond that.”
In a March 26 email to international students, the International Office wrote that “any future travel to the U.S. may be impacted by the U.S. government’s travel suspension.”
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic — and an accompanying Level 4 health advisory admonishing global travel — the United States Department of State suspended normal visa services indefinitely at all of its embassies and consulates beginning March 20.
The State Department has not yet announced when they will resume; it currently offers only emergency visa services.
The process of acquiring a visa for international students can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months. However, as F and M visas for new students can be issued no more than 120 days before beginning a course of study, incoming undergraduates still have around a month before they can begin applying for a visa.
Fitzsmmons said he recognizes students may feel insecure traveling away from loved ones, given the growing crisis.
“One question with the coronavirus is whether or not families would feel comfortable, or students would feel comfortable, about going far from home, whether it’s even some part of the United States or from another country,” Fitzsimmons said.
The Harvard International Office has reassured current international students — who compose about 11 percent of the Harvard College student body — that they will be able to return to the United States in September as long as required immigration documents such as unexpired passports and visas are in order. Moreover, the legal immigration status of students currently on a visa should not change if they continue to make progress in their studies.
The International Office is offering online webinars so that students can ask questions and share concerns with office staff and Mark C. Elliott, Harvard's Vice Provost for International Affairs. It also established a coronavirus webpage to address common concerns from students and scholars.
“As you will be maintaining your student visa status while taking your full-time on-line classes, you should be able to reenter the U.S. once the various travel bans are lifted,” the website reads.

Harvard College freshmen will not have to wait much longer — the Class of 2023 will find out their upperclassman house assignments on April 10, the Dean of Students Office announced Thursday.
Following most students’ departure from campus amid coronavirus concerns, the office announced the virtual iteration of Housing Day, the annual tradition in which freshmen are assigned to one of 12 houses, in a Thursday email.
“With a rush to de-densify campus, we weren’t able to complete the housing lottery,” the email read. “One of the biggest questions we didn't answer for you is your House assignment. We're working on it now!”
The news of a rescheduled Housing Day comes more than three weeks after the College elected to postpone the festivities indefinitely in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
The email encouraged freshmen to prepare for Housing Day by posting blocking group introduction videos to TikTok and Instagram with the hashtag #HousingDay2020.
“Introduce yourselves, learn a dance, or sing a song — be creative and show us why your blocking group is one of the best!” the email read.
Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 said in a Thursday interview that rescheduling the annual tradition was a pressing concern for many, and that she was thankful for the cooperation from the Houses.
“I'm really grateful to the housing office, all of the House Committees, and the faculty deans that really pulled together and managed to create something that we hope will be very special for first-year students,” she said.
While freshman blocking groups focus on their TikTok and Instagram debuts, House Committee chairs are planning “Zoom storming” — virtual dorm storming — to replace the tradition of upperclassmen going from dorm to dorm in Harvard Yard to surprise freshmen with their assignments.
Andrea J. Zhang ’22 — one of the Kirkland House Committee co-chairs — wrote in an email that she and other Kirkland residents were prepared to deliver a “Zoom storm” overflowing with House pride.
“Of course, it will be very different from live dorm-storming, but students are still excited to interact with the freshmen and welcome them to the house!” Zhang wrote. “We’re planning to get decked out in Kirkland gear, chant our ode, and invite them to our virtual stein.”
A virtual Housing Day is one of the many ways student life has adapted to remote programming. Houses have largely turned to Zoom activities to replace regular events, including virtual “dining halls” and thesis presentations.
Eliot House Committee chairs Zachary R. Fraley ’21 and Jason S. Lee ’21 said the virtual Housing Day — while not a complete substitute for the usual event — will still allow freshmen to become acquainted with their new homes. They also said Eliot will introduce new members to current residents through other virtual events, such as hosting House-wide “stein” socials and pairing freshman blocking groups with upperclassmen.
“It's not just a House tradition. It's a College tradition,” Fraley said. “We're all under changing circumstances, every day, every hour even, and just to have some sort of continuity, I personally find it really comforting.”
He added that the event gives both freshmen and upperclassmen a day to look forward to.
“It gives everyone something else to plan for, to work forward to, and just get excited for,” Fraley said. “It's not going to be the same, we're not gonna be up at 7 a.m. in the freezing cold, storming and running around on muddy ground, but it could still be a fun experience. It could still be a tradition, and it could still be a memory, just with some alterations this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Late Sunday night, Harvard men’s lacrosse coach Gerry M. Byrne emailed his players a link to the song “Down to the River To Pray.”
“I heard this tonight on my shuffle and for some reason it made me think of you all and this time we are living in,” he wrote, referring to the folk song by Alison Krauss. “Play this before turning in tonight.”
After the coronavirus curtailed Byrne’s first season coaching at Harvard and forced him and his players to quarantine in their respective homes, he said he has been trying to find new ways — like emailing his players — to feel connected.
Since the global pandemic halted athletics and forced Harvard students to vacate campus, Harvard’s student-athletes and their coaches say they are trying to maintain unity and fitness away from Cambridge as they live through quarantine, making use of Zoom, message groups, and at-home workout routines.
“I'm doing Zoom meetings and phone calls and technical development,” Byrne said. “But also doing things that bind us together, whether it's an article or a documentary or a song or something that connects us.”
The Athletics Department has also continued to provide resources to athletes remotely, including physician, athletic training, nutrition, and mental health services, according to Brant D. Berkstresser, the associate director of athletics for student-athlete health and performance.
For student-athletes and coaches, such resources serve as a substitute for lost daily structures, support groups, and passions.
Women’s lacrosse player Shealyn M. Jenkins ’22 said she misses the structure and emotional support that came with devoting hours each day to her sport. Without lacrosse, she said, she is unsure how to spend her time.
“We just have a lot of energy and nowhere to put it,” she said. “The big problem is just finding out different ways to sort of fill that hole.”
Jenkins said she is devastated her team will not be able to play this season as a result of the coronavirus. She said she is even more disappointed by the missed opportunity to be with her teammates.
To compensate, Jenkins said team members are sharing memories with one another in their group chats.
“I think that’s the most helpful thing that’s really been keeping us all together is talking about like, ‘Oh my god remember last year when we did this’ or ‘Do you remember this season when we beat this team?’” she said. “We just are taking this time to sort of reflect and think about all the amazing memories that we were fortunate enough to experience.”
In addition to reflecting on previous memories, teams are also striving to create new ones as they complete the semester away from Cambridge.
Members of the women’s basketball team showed up to their first team meeting on Zoom last week sporting makeshift glasses they created from household items. One of the team’s captains, Rachel D. Levy ’21, said players and coaches joined the meeting wearing bagels, ankle braces, or sunflower vines taped around their eyes.
Levy — who is also a Crimson multimedia editor — said she and her teammates are finding creative ways to spend time with each other on Zoom. Next up on the team’s social calendar in quarantine, Levy said, is a talent show, followed by a cooking class.
“We all said we’d do a class, so if you speak a language or have a funny talent or something, you can host a Zoom class that everybody should log onto, just like an excuse to hang out with one another,” she said. “Because it’s such a weird time and we want to stay in contact and keep all those friendships we have.”
Levy said she and her teammates also continue to train. Every day at 6 p.m., Levy logs onto Zoom from the backyard of her home in Boca Raton, Fla., to work out with her teammates. To simulate weights, Levy said she uses Prego pasta sauce jars and a backpack filled with her middle school yearbooks.
Harvard football coach Tim L. Murphy said he and his coaching staff have shifted their operations to Zoom, where they are holding virtual training sessions to study film and review plays. Offline, Murphy said his players are doing prescribed body weight exercises, “some as simple as push ups and sit ups like the old, old old days.”
“It’s to try to keep them on track in terms of their goals as being Division I student athletes. But I've found that it’s very, for a lot of kids, it’s just a nice way to feel like there’s some stability to the program,” he said. “Keeping in touch I think is very soothing for the student-athletes and coaches.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the coronavirus outbreak prompted Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services to transition to solely remote care, some students have voiced appreciation for CAMHS’s continued support, while others raise concerns about the quality of its communication and its care.
CAMHS has been operating virtually since March 18 to limit the potential spread of COVID-19, Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote in an email. CAMHS did not send an email directly to College students about its service changes, however, until this Thursday evening. In the email, Chief of CAMHS Barbara Lewis offered information on available options for individual phone therapy and video therapy sessions, which will become available starting the week of April 13.
Some students, however, say they were unaware of the changes CAMHS has made to its care model. Marcus M. Trenfield ’21 said he has visited CAMHS regularly since the fall of his freshman year, usually meeting with his clinician one to two times per month. But after University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced that students were not to return to campus after spring break, he “assumed” CAMHS would stop providing care.
Trenfield said that because of current social distancing protocols, he did not expect to continue therapy until he returned to campus.
“I just gave up on therapy,” Trenfield said. “I was like, I guess I'm just not doing therapy for the rest of the time until next semester, because people are really avoiding in-person meetings, and I probably wouldn't want to see someone in person.”
Trenfield wrote in an email that, at first, he was unaware that CAMHS had transitioned to phone calls for therapy sessions. He said he was “surprised” when, just days before his previously scheduled appointment, he received a confirmation email from CAMHS.
Though Trenfield said he is “grateful” that CAMHS is continuing to provide care, he expressed concern that students might remain unaware of the changes because of a lack of sustained, effective outreach.
“I do feel like CAMHS is running into issues that it runs into often, where it develops services or changes services, and then isn't outspoken about it and doesn't get the news out to students,” he said. “I don't know why we haven't had one mental health themed email or an important update, where it's just like, here are the different mental health services that you can use.”
Cameron P.G. Clark ’22 reiterated this concern, saying CAMHS has not been “particularly effective” in informing students about changes to its services.
Tania Veltchev ’22 said she believes CAMHS must be “aggressively straightforward” in the information it provides to students so that those who need mental health resources are able to easily access them.
“I think people need to be spoon-fed, step by step, as simply as possible, how to get engaged, get involved, and get themselves help in this case,” she said. “The people who are going to need the help most aren't going to have the focus or the energy to work things out if they come across roadblocks.”
Veltchev said she feels that video and phone calls for therapy are “far from ideal,” particularly because it is hard to read body language online, but that it is better than the alternative of no therapy at all.
Therapy via phone or video call also pose challenges for students who do not have a private place to speak; Trenfield, for example, said he had to sit in his car for privacy during his phone therapy session.
In an interview last week, Lewis said she understands this problem and added that being at home also poses difficulties for clinicians, who may have children to take care of. However, she said, both students and clinicians have been finding ways to adapt to the new situation.
“Some [students] have gone for walks and had sessions doing that. It's not 100 percent private, but I think it's okay to do that way,” she said. “A few [clinicians] have been working outside of our scheduled hours because of those challenges and I'm happy with that just because it's accommodating the students and also just trying to fit it into what they can do from home.”
For international students, meanwhile, phone calls can pose an additional problem — added cost.
Clark, who hails from South Africa, said a phone call for a CAMHS session would be “crazy expensive.”
Nour Abou-Hussein ’22 said that while she understands CAMHS is “constrained” in terms of what it can currently offer, she does not think the needs of international students are adequately taken into account.
“I see that they are definitely constrained and restricted on what they can do and they are doing the best they can,” she said. “But I still don't think there's enough consideration for international students' needs in terms of mental health or CAMHS services.”
Abou-Hussein said that a phone call from Egypt, where she lives, would be costly, and a video call might be difficult because of poor WiFi connection.
Lewis, however, said in an interview that CAMHS has not yet implemented video capability. This also means that most group therapy sessions and workshops are not being held as usual. She wrote in her Thursday email that group therapy sessions will be available over video once clinician training and individual video therapy sessions are “successfully implemented.”
Veltchev said CAMHS should try to get video groups up and running again “ASAP,” adding that she thinks group therapy is especially important while people are being asked to practice social distancing.
“I think that the value of group therapy right now is tenfold,” she said. “Seeing more people when you have pretty limited access to other human beings right now is a massive, massive, massive predictor of maintaining our mental health.”
Lewis added in an interview that, despite the drawbacks, not having group sessions and workshops frees up availability for clinicians. In addition, the absence of athletes on campus opens up additional time for the two CAMHS clinicians usually reserved for those athletes.
Elizabeth A. Denehy ’22 — a student athlete wellness leader with the Crimson Mind and Body Program, which offers mental health support to student-athletes — said CAMHS has continued providing helpful resources to athletes.
“What they've been doing since we've left school is sending out these information sheets with coping skills, reminding us to self care and also reminding us that we can still make appointments with them,” she said.
Despite any frustrations with CAMHS's changes, many students said they appreciated that it has committed to continuing to provide care, albeit remotely.
“I do think they're trying the best they can given the circumstances and given the really small timeframe we had to leave campus and to suddenly change our lives,” Abou-Hussein said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 4, 2020, 4:26 p.m.
Nearly 200 third-year Harvard Law School students signed a letter to Law School administrators Thursday asking for the school to publicly advocate for an emergency diploma privilege — a policy granting graduating students their law licenses without requiring the bar examination.
The letter asked the Law School to take four specific actions on behalf of its students. These requests include issuing a public statement supporting the emergency diploma privilege across the United States; sharing the students’ letter with other law schools; sending a statement supporting the privilege to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts; and hosting a virtual town hall for students to discuss their needs with the administration.
Donna C. Saadati-Soto, a co-author of the letter, said she believes it would be unfair to ask students to sit for the multi-day exam this summer since the ongoing coronavirus pandemic limits the ability of some students to prepare over the coming months.
“I intended to sit for the California bar exam that was set to happen in July,” she said. "There's no way that folks are going to be able to sit for a July 2020 administration of the exam.”
Saadati-Soto said that several states have already postponed their exams in light of the COVID-19 crisis and associated social distancing restrictions. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts announced Monday it would postpone its July 28 and 29 exam until an undetermined date in the fall.
But the Law School students’ letter argues that merely postponing the bar exam will jeopardize the employment opportunities and financial security of graduates.
“Most HLS graduates planned to begin working with employers starting late Summer or Fall 2020,” it reads. “If state bar exams continue to be postponed, it is unclear if students will begin working, as planned.”
The letter discusses how deferred employment could particularly harm international students, whose immigration status could be affected by unemployment, as well as first-generation and low-income students.
“For those students with limited means, it is unclear how they will financially support themselves, and their families, if their employment starts at a later date,” the letter reads. “For all, it is unclear if students will be expected to begin making payments on their student loans this year.”
Saadati-Soto said students who can secure employment before the postponed exam might have to decide whether to work full-time or study for the exam full-time — a decision she thinks would eliminate traditionally marginalized students from the legal profession.
“Folks that don't have the financial security to be able to just quit their job and study for the bar at any moment — they might choose to forego the state bar,” she said. “That means low-income students, immigrant students, folks of color are the ones that are going to be more likely to have to forgo taking or studying a later exam because they're going to be needing to work to provide for themselves and their family.”
She also said that the legal profession currently faces a mental health crisis, and having to take the bar exam could exacerbate the issue by adding unnecessary financial and academic stress in the midst of a global pandemic.
Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement that administrators realize the bar exam’s postponement in several states has disrupted graduating students’ plans. Neal added that administrators appreciate that students have taken initiative and proposed a solution to this problem, and that the school will continue to work with the state to “explore” ways to address it.
“Our student services offices also stand ready to work with our students one-on-one to help them assess their plans and chart a path forward in light of changing events,” he wrote.
Marilyn J. Wellington, executive director of the Massachusetts Board of Bar Examiners, declined to comment on the students’ proposal.
The students’ letter also listed additional concerns about postponed exams, such as uncertainty about what the state of the pandemic will be in the fall.
“Given that vaccinations and preventative medical therapies will not open to the market for at least a year, the potential for another outbreak is simply a matter of time,” it reads. “A shortsighted decision to merely postpone the July exam, if met with the high probability of subsequent outbreak and a resulting further postponement, will deprive Americans of crucial legal assistance in the months ahead.”
The letter argues that the huge numbers of people impacted by COVID-19 require that as many lawyers as possible enter the workforce to advocate for struggling small businesses, recently unemployed individuals, and families facing eviction.
It also alleges the country could need more lawyers to continue providing criminal defense and advocating on behalf of working people and detained immigrants — a need it claims can only be fulfilled if law school graduates are granted automatic admission to the Bar.
“We cannot ignore matters of due process and deprivations of individual liberty, even in times of novel national crises,” the letter reads. “We the undersigned request that Harvard Law School recognize the imminent need for legal advocates and take the most humane, public-health conscious, and ethical approach.”
“Just as our colleagues in medical schools have been called upon to join the front lines fighting COVID-19, so too are attorneys needed to fight for the rights of individuals most affected by this pandemic,” it concludes.

As non-essential establishments in Massachusetts shut their doors in compliance with Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79’s stay-at-home advisory, several Harvard Square businesses and organizations are offering virtual programming to engage locals.
The online activities range from virtual art exhibitions by the Cambridge Art Association and the Harvard Art Museums to live-streamed yoga by Barre & Soul.
“As people are sheltering in, the need for virtual activities may become an important and essential part of daily routines,” a newly curated online activities page on the Harvard Square Business Association website reads. “Isolation, loneliness and the lack of activity create their own kind of unhealthiness.”
Despite the closures, many businesses assure customers that they will continue to support them throughout the pandemic. Alley — an online workplace for creators — hosted two online events discussing technology and collaboration on Wednesday and Thursday.
Alley CEO Noelle Tassey said technology plays an important role in keeping people connected during quarantine.
“I'm super excited about VR and AR and how we'll be leveraging those technologies more and more to foster connection, especially given this crisis,” she said.
Tassey added that she is concerned about the impact of these closures on the survival of small businesses.
“We all talk about, like, small businesses, restaurants, hospitality,” she said. “These are industries that have obviously been massively disrupted and hurt by this crisis.”
Restaurants such as Clover Food Lab have continued customer outreach amid the crisis via their mailing lists and blogs. In a statement by Clover Marketing Manager Jane Hu, Clover advertised a new Youtube channel that features recipes and tips for cooking at home, created by Clover CEO Ayr Muir.
In the arts sector, Brattle Theatre is releasing film podcasts, suggesting movie titles for children, and presenting a film series that encourages social distancing under the title “Keep Your Distance.”
Brattle Theatre Creative Director Ned Hinkle said the goal behind these initiatives is to keep locals engaged.
“We want to stay engaged with our community of movie lovers and cinephiles and so we've launched a number of online virtual programs for the Brattle,” Hinkle said. “Most of our programs that we're offering right now are suggestions for titles that are streaming online.”
Local vocal ensemble Blue Heron, meanwhile, released clips of performances from 2016 after being forced to cancel shows scheduled for this month.
“It seems most likely that we will be faced with canceling all of our public events for the rest of this season,” Blue Heron Artistic Director Scott Metcalfe said. “So, that means, a tremendous loss of income, of course, as well as a loss of feasibility and making music together.”
“From the standpoint of the individual musicians, I think the situation is even worse because musicians, many of us are primarily or exclusively freelancers,” he added.
Metcalfe also said he foresees grim consequences of the pandemic for many small businesses and individuals, comparing the pandemic to the Great Recession around 10 years ago.
“We don't really know how much longer it's gonna last. And we're all hoping, of course, that every organization that we work for and work with is going to survive this. And I think that's probably not going to happen,” he said. “That's what we're facing: just pure, that sort of existential threat to artistic institutions and to individual artists.
Still, Metcalfe said he has seen a positive response to Blue Heron’s online initiatives.
“People are just responding incredibly generously,” he said. “I think that we are very happy to say that we are, I think, safe for the moment, both very moving and very encouraging for long-term survival.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard College students debated grading policies for remote classes in Facebook groups and Zoom calls, so too did administrators in closed-door committee meetings, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh.
In an interview Thursday, Claybaugh laid out administrators’ shifting thinking on grading policy over time. She said that in response to student and faculty fervor, the Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy moved up its timeline for deciding how Harvard would change grading.
Last Friday, Claybaugh relayed to students the decision to adopt a College-wide satisfactory-unsatisfactory system. Under this system, all undergraduates will now receive grades of either “Emergency Satisfactory” or “Emergency Unsatisfactory” for their spring classes.
Claybaugh said concerns over grading amid the COVID-19 crisis began “bubbling up” during spring break, almost immediately after students left Cambridge.
“My own view at the time was, we're not in a position to make a decision, we have to see how it goes, we can't become panicked about how online teaching will go,” she said. “Maybe it will be better than we think; maybe it will be worse. We'll know more after a week.”
However, Claybaugh said the first week of online classes after spring break made it clear that the College needed to act promptly.
“I was getting so many questions and concerns from faculty that I felt like we need to move up the decision making process now,” she said.
The policy represented the outgrowth of feedback from students and faculty, Claybaugh said.
She wrote to directors of undergraduate studies in all departments to gauge their opinion on grading during the health crisis. Many departments had already independently granted their concentrators permission to take departmental requirements pass-fail.
Claybaugh said directors debated the issue “vigorously” for a week over their email list. Faculty first floated the idea of a new grading system after MIT decided to impose a universal pail-fail grading policy.
Initially, professors were divided over the issue — half supported a new universal grading system, and half found an opt-in pass-fail system sufficient, Claybaugh said.
“But over the week, as the impacts of the virus became more and more clear, more and more DUS's were saying, 'We can't do this,” she said.
“I was getting dozens and then scores of emails from students and from instructors, both students saying, ‘My Internet's not working, I'm going to fail a test,’ and really more though hearing from faculty saying, ‘I can't do this. I can't meaningfully compare students to one another’,” she added.
At the same time, Claybaugh said other undergraduates emailed her requesting the grading policy remain the same. Claybaugh and her colleagues presented these dueling positions to the Undergraduate Educational Policy Committee, a Faculty of Arts and Sciences standing committee that oversees undergraduate education.
The committee discussed the issue and ultimately recommended the universal emergency satisfactory-unsatisfactory system. The recommendation then arrived before the Faculty Council, which comprises representatives from each of the FAS's four divisions, for final approval.
“In both groups, there was a consensus that this was what had to happen,” Claybaugh said.
The student body, however, has yet to reach a happy consensus on the matter. In recent weeks, students have clashed over which grading systems would best serve students struggling during the coronavirus pandemic. These heated disputes have flared up across house email lists, Undergraduate Council meetings, petitions, and counter-petitions.
Claybaugh said she was initially uncompelled by arguments for a universal system.
“If I were to take off my dean hat and put on my faculty hat, I would say I was initially opposed,” she said. “I initially thought that opt-in pass-fail was enough.”
However, one week later, she said her views changed as she learned more about students’ difficult circumstances during the pandemic.
What swayed her, in part, was the realization that the opt-in system only gave students the illusion of choice.
“Students who have good access to internet, who do not have a sick family member quarantined with them, who are not in a timezone 12 hours away, who do not have a mother working as a doctor and are worried about that — those students can be described as free to make a choice about whether they want a grade or a pass,” she added. “Other students don't have that choice.”
She also said she worried that, if certain students’ circumstances compelled them to opt into receiving grades pass-fail, they might be penalized in graduate school and fellowship applications.
When Harvard Medical School announced it would only accept non-letter grades for a student’s required courses if their school had imposed a universal system, Claybaugh said the announcement cemented her new stance.
“Where Harvard Medical School goes, other schools will follow,” she said.
Claybaugh also said the committee weighed alternative grading paths proposed by undergraduates, finding them lacking for various reasons. Undergraduate contingents suggested universal pass-fail, universal pass, and “Double A” systems.
While Claybaugh said the committee understood the impulse behind the latter two proposals, they ultimately nixed them because accreditation bodies often do not recognize grades if there is no possibility a student could receive a fail.
“They don't find it meaningful if the worst you can do is an A-minus. Then your grades provide no information,” she said. “The whole semesters' worth of grades coming out of Harvard would not be taken seriously by fellowships. There has to be a possibility to not do well.”
Since the committee’s announcement, some students have questioned why the College decided on a universal satisfactory-unsatisfactory system in lieu of a universal pass fail system.
Under a pass-fail system, a pass grade includes letter grades of D-minus or higher whereas under a satisfactory-unsatisfactory system, a satisfactory grade is the equivalent of a C-minus letter grade or higher.
Claybaugh said the College said the committee decided to implement the latter option because they believed maintaining certain academic standards was important.
“We need a Satisfactory at Harvard to mean something acceptable,” she said. “So we felt that it was important to preserve SAT as a grade you could be proud of.”
Claybaugh said that after she announced the universal policy, her inbox flooded with emails from students despondent over being deprived of letter grades.
“I understand why they're upset, absolutely. They made plans for their semester that have gotten upended. They feel that the plans they are making for their lives are being called into question right now,” she said.
Still, she said the tenor of student emails has changed in recent days.
“I've started to get emails from students saying, ‘Thank you, I've just fallen ill. I don't know how I could keep up with my classes.’ ‘Thank you, my mother's just fallen ill,’” she said. “As the medical reality of this starts to hit students, they're going to see that we couldn't carry on as if things had not changed.”
Claybaugh said faculty members have expressed concern over the new grading system would complicate calculating Latin honors, evaluating senior theses, and judging for undergraduate academic prizes.
“Then a faculty member, usually someone in the biological sciences, would say, ‘What are we talking about? We're in the middle of a global pandemic, and millions of people are going to die,’” she said.
While Claybaugh said she recognizes student frustration with the new change in grading, she similarly hoped for a “perspectival shift” about the significance of grades.
“A number of students wrote to me to say, ‘Well, there's no point in my courses anymore now that I'm not getting grades,’” she said. “But I hope that they will continue to engage in their courses because their instructors are making great efforts under quite difficult circumstances to try to keep teaching. And I think there's a lot to still be learned. And I hope that students will realize that grades are not the beginning and the end of their learning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana defended his administration’s handling of a mass move-out amid the coronavirus pandemic in an interview Tuesday, describing nightly meetings aimed at addressing new student concerns and noting that the College plans to conduct an “after-action review” of its response.
After the College announced undergraduates must leave campus and finish their semester remotely to prevent the spread of coronavirus, some students voiced concerns over how the administration communicated its decision and corresponding contingency plans.
Khurana said conveying both the rationale behind the decision to “de-densify” campus and information about move-out resources was especially difficult due to the diversity of Harvard’s student body.
“I think it took some time for folks to kind of understand what the meaning of this was, understanding how it was gonna affect different people differently,” he said.
Khurana said that students did, however, spot initial “gaps” in support and resources during the five-day move-out window.
“There were a lot more questions students had that we didn't always anticipate,” he said. “And what we tried to do is every day, as we process the questions, really update our FAQs as quickly as possible.”
In order to address these concerns, Khurana said administrators met every night to brainstorm solutions to implement the next day. Between his Tuesday announcement and the Sunday evacuation deadline, the College rolled out a variety of new support services for students.
“We really put our organization very much in problem-solving mode and continuous-improvement mode,” he added.
Students raised questions about their financial ability to ship and store belongings, for example, to which the College responded by granting financial aid recipients a $200 subsidy. Similar concerns about the cost of transport home spurred the College to offer those with financial aid packages travel reimbursements, as well.
Beyond the economic hurdle of returning home, some students faced additional barriers, including travel bans and unsafe family environments. The College announced that students could petition to remain on campus, though cautioning that it would grant such petitions sparingly.
Khurana said that the College had to work quickly to flesh out and clearly articulate the criteria for a successful petition, as well as to create an “extension policy” for those who needed extra time to develop personal contingency plans.
However, Khurana acknowledged that many students had questions to which the College could not offer immediate answers.
First generation, low income students, for example, worried about the potential loss of their on-campus employment. Students from rural areas without internet access asked how they would be expected to complete their online work. Other students requested details about the College’s reimbursement plans and how room and board would be prorated.
“When you have 6,600 students from all parts of our country in different parts of the world, different where you are if you're a first year student versus the questions you have as a senior, we tried to make sure that we were able to show particularizing for different interests that people had, depending on their concentration, depending on whether their thesis had been handed in or not handed in,” he said.
Khurana said the College deliberately waited to address many of these “second-order” questions to focus on fulfilling its immediate imperative to minimize the spread of the coronavirus.
“Those are all important questions, but we also felt it was important to again de-densify the campus as quickly as possible, and then provide a lot of clarity once the team had finished doing that,” Khurana said.
He added that the College anticipated using spring break to address questions about what coursework would look like during the latter half of the semester.
“I think we recognized also that there were questions that students had about what remote learning would mean for them, and did they have a place to do remote learning? What technologies were we going to be relying on for doing remote learning? What were the expectations?” he added. “We tried to answer those as best as we could, knowing that we would have this spring break week to basically address the questions of academic continuity.”
Still, Khurana said he recognizes there was room for improvement in the College’s response. He said the College would conduct an “after-action review” of its decision coordination and communication process in order to retool its response to future emergencies.
“I think it's really important to just acknowledge that there's obviously things that we could always do better and improve,” he said.
Khurana said that despite the disruptiveness of the evacuation, he was moved by how undergraduates organized to support their peers during and after the move-out.
Students mobilized, for example, to compile a list of affiliates willing to open their homes to those who did not feel safe returning home.
“Their concerns about their peers, and others who may be in difficult situations, just provided such a sense of hope and possibility because it's exactly what we want our students to be, which are caring citizens and citizen-leaders who are thinking about others before they're thinking about themselves,” Khurana said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As of Thursday, the governors of at least 38 states — including Massachusetts — had issued stay-at-home orders in an attempt to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus. Harvard, meanwhile, asked most of its students, faculty, and staff to vacate campus last month.
But for some affiliates, staying at home means staying in homes that are owned by Harvard.
Harvard University Housing — which is available to graduate students, faculty and employees at the University — currently maintains 61 properties in Cambridge and Boston. That equals approximately 3,000 apartments, with rents ranging from $1,206 to $5,364.
On Monday, the Cambridge City Council passed a resolution encouraging city landlords to forgo evictions and rent increases for the next 60 days due to the financial burden of the pandemic.
According to University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke, HUH has made a number of changes to its policies to aid tenants who have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
Administrators remain dedicated to providing residents “a healthy, safe and comfortable experience,” according to O’Rourke.
“Harvard University Housing is working hard to adapt policies and practices in support of its tenants during this unprecedented situation,” O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement. “It understands the difficulties some may be facing and is committed to working with residents to provide stability, relief and peace of mind in as much as it is possible during this difficult time.”
One such change is halting eviction proceedings for the time being, per O’Rourke. Boston Housing Court has suspended most eviction proceedings until April 22.
Another change allows tenants to change the conditions of their lease. In an email to residents on March 14, HUH provided them three options: extend their lease, terminate their lease on the scheduled date of June 30, or terminate and vacate the apartment early.
If residents chose to vacate and had roommates, “remaining roommates are not responsible for the vacating roommate’s rent, through June 30,” according to the email. After June 3o, they will be expected to pay the rent in full.
This policy benefited Louis-Samuel Pilcer, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School from France who was forced to leave the United States — and his apartment at Peabody Terrace — on short notice.
Soon after French President Emmanuel Macron announced a national lockdown on March 16, Pilcer received instructions from the French Consulate to return to France, since his visa was set to expire before June 30.
“They were worried that we could get blocked in the United States and lose our healthcare insurance when the student visa expires,” Pilcer wrote in an email. “They told me that flights planned for the week of March 23 would be maintained, but that later flights were highly uncertain. As a result, I booked a — very expensive — flight ticket and started packing my luggage.”
Because he received the email from HUH, he said he did not worry about his lease until he had arrived home in France. Then, he logged onto a portal and indicated that he wanted to terminate his lease.
“Ordinarily, you need to apply at least a month before if you want to end your lease,” Pilcer wrote. “They enabled me to end it in one day: I asked on Friday, it ended on Friday.”
Pilcer wrote he was “grateful” for the change.
“This decision prevented me from having an additional month of rent to pay. Moving in emergency was expensive — flight ticket, 3 luggage, I couldn’t sell most of my furniture before moving — and makes it even harder to pay back my student debt,” Pilcer wrote. “I’m very grateful to Harvard Housing for trying to alleviate part of our financial hardship in this extraordinary situation.”
According to the March 14 email, tenants were expected to notify HUH what they decided to do about their housing by March 31. On March 30, though, HUH sent a follow-up email to residents allowing them until April 15 to make a decision.
Christopher G. Cochran, a Ph.D. candidate in Classical Philology, wrote that though he was not impacted “that much” by coronavirus, the ability to change the conditions of his lease benefited him and his boyfriend.
Cochran wrote that he was already planning to leave his HUH this summer, since he is planning to finish his degree.
“Because of Harvard's new flexible policy on breaking leases early […] we were able to be flexible on the move-in date when we were apartment hunting, and as a result got a great deal on a new apartment!” Cochran wrote.
He said he thinks the policy changes have been “generous and appropriate.”
Other changes include temporarily moving some residents of the Cronkhite Graduate Center to undergraduate housing in the Radcliffe Quadrangle, at no cost, in order to adhere to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that say each occupant must have their own bedroom and bathroom. HUH has also moved programming for residents online.
One aspect that has not changed is rent.
In January, HUH announced that rent for the upcoming academic year would increase by an average of one percent — ranging from zero to two percent, unit-by-unit.
O’Rourke said that remains true, but that rent-setting for the following year will reflect the impact of coronavirus on the local housing market.
Cochran said he does not think changes to rent are necessary at this time since the majority of residents are Harvard affiliates who will be paid through the end of the semester.
“This could change, however, in the summer because there are a lot of graduate students who rely on income from summer travel stipends or from teaching Harvard summer school,” Cochran wrote. “If GSAS does not guarantee summer income, then it may be hard for graduate students to make rent payments.”

It’s hard to imagine how we would be navigating school without the incredible power of technology. Zoom sessions allow us to attend lectures from anywhere in the world, so why not explore the possibilities? Why limit yourself to your messy bedroom with your stuffed animals or pile of laundry inconspicuously tucked away from the range of your webcam? Modern problems require modern solutions.
School in quarantine isn’t exactly the most exciting, but taking advantage of the virtual background feature on Zoom can still let you have some fun with it. Here are some suggestions that’ll make your Zoom classmates envious of your setup.
The Pink Wall from The Office
We’re all familiar with this iconic backdrop from The Office. This setting has witnessed countless confessions and monologues from our favorite workaholics, and now you can finally live out your dream as a working professional at a paper company. Not only will your peers take you seriously in this businesslike setting, but you’ll also be able to mask the fact that you’re still in bed at 3 p.m.
Your Old Dorm Room
Some of us would love to be in Hawaii or France right now. Some of us just want nothing more than to be back in our suites carrying on a normal semester at Harvard. That’s valid, and we hear you. Set your Zoom background to be a nostalgic photo of your old suite, complete with the unstable lamps and wooden bookshelf. You can pretend eviction week never happened. Coronavirus? What coronavirus? Haha! Can’t hear anything over the sound of the cars rumbling past JFK St.
A Photo of Your Professor
Put Section Kid in their place by making your background a blown up photo of the professor. This is the best way of demonstrating interest in the course and standing out from everyone else. Your professor will feel flattered, and it may even give them a boost of morale as they continue lecturing to a sea of muted, black boxes. Bonus points if you participate in class and force the professor to engage with you while making eye contact with their own face.
Your HUID
Just because you’re now an unwilling student of Zoom University doesn’t mean you have to stop flexing that you go to Harvard. We understand how debilitating it is to go more than ten minutes without bringing it up in some regard, so we’re looking out for you. Play around with Photoshop so that your face pops up in the square of an HUID backdrop — right on time for your 7:30 a.m. class.
Yale’s Campus
It’s no question that online classes can’t measure up to the experience of attending school on campus, so it’s only fair to represent how subpar the rest of this semester is visually. With Yale’s campus as your virtual background, you can truly capture the essence of attending a second-tier school. If any part of the Zoom lectures, spotty WiFi connection, or awkward silences when leaving a meeting leaves a bad taste in your mouth, you can attribute it to how Yalies must feel on a daily basis.
Virtual backgrounds are just one way to add a little positivity and fun to an experience that we are all still struggling to get used to. Although over-laying your video feed with a photo of a beach isn’t quite enough to emulate the freedom of walking around campus with your friends, we hope that these tips can add a spring to the 200 steps you take per day.
