After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

“Game of Thrones”—now twelve episodes away from death’s door—has the unfortunate habit of perpetually setting the table for the promise of delayed gratification.
This does not mean that “Game of Thrones” is unsuccessful television. All narratives face problems with making the context as compelling as the climax; and, in the series’ defense, it has managed to show, with annual consistency, that its climaxes are worth the journey. However, the episodes surrounding the series’ best hours (“Blackwater,” “The Rains of Castamere,” and “Hardhome,” among others) are still occasionally poorly plotted context at best—and lazy table setting at worst.
The latter is the pervading case in “Dragonstone.” The season premiere assumes that the audience skipped the opening recap sequence, instead rehashing the simplest facts about the landscape of “Game of Thrones.” We are gently reminded in not one, but in two separate visions that the White Walkers—an ice zombie army—are marching towards the North. After six seasons of murderous, suicide-inducing, and genocidal behavior, Cersei Lannister feels the need to remind her brother and the audience (both of which have witnessed her aforementioned murderous, suicide-inducing, and genocidal behavior) that the Lannisters have, “enemies to the east […] enemies to the south […] enemies to the west […] enemies to the north [...] enemies everywhere.” This all, quite unsubtly, occurs as the newly anointed queen stands on top of a newly painted map of Westeros—lest the audience forget the geography that they are reminded of every week during the sequence of opening credits.
Perhaps taken individually, none of these scenes is the harbinger of poor television. However, taken together, they paint an unfortunate picture of a script that was formulated retrospectively and with an absolute absence of trust in the audience. “Dragonstone” feels predestined—as if the writers (David Benioff and D. B. Weiss) knew how the story ends and worked backwards to produce the necessary plot machinations.
We visit Jon Snow and Sansa Stark in the North to see their developing sibling (cousin?) rivalry and reconciliation. We visit Samwell Tarly to be reminded that Jorah Mormont is still alive. We see Arya Stark’s journey south for an indulgent Ed Sheeran cameo. Daenerys Targaryen graces us with her presence to move her army to her ancestral home (as if that plot development was ever in doubt).
It is not problematic that each scene seems to have a purpose in the show’s narrative arc (save Ed Sheeran). Nevertheless, it is problematic that each scene is explicitly diagnosable as a gear in a plot device or an unprompted indictment of an amnesiac audience. There have been few season premieres in recent memory that have been so brazenly explicit about its narrative function of setting up the action in the episodes to come. In the show’s search for a digestible and organized plot, it loses the unbridled feeling of human creativity that marks the show at its best moments.
That’s a problem. If “Game of Thrones” is going to move some of its episodes at the beleaguered pace of “Dragonstone,” then it has to introduce some complexity to its scenes beyond blunt narrative advancement. If “Game of Thrones” is going to abandon utilizing the strengths of its expansive narrative landscape—the wonder of seeing a world fashioned from dust—it must stop treating its audience like a group of impotent fools. Moreover, if the pace of “Dragonstone” is an indication of a rediscovered dedication to the unstable ideals of character development, then it is going to have to focus its story on a smaller group of characters, give each actor better material to work with, and find better actors.
Even in his brief appearance, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister) seems unusually complacent for his acting ability. Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen) has turned a formerly complex character into a facile depiction of projecting power. Moreover, Maisie Williams (Arya Stark) continues to give one of the most bizarre and unfeeling portraits of a vengeful, psychopathic, Sweeney Todd meets Dexter, serial killer.
With that said, “Dragonstone” is only a season premiere—and the writers of “Game of Thrones” have a three-and-a-half-season track record of producing high quality television. The disrespect of the audience’s intelligence and the nearly formulaic way that the premiere approaches narrative is troubling for the fate of future episodes. However, at the core of “Dragonstone’s” failure is the simple fact that it is a quiet, table-setting episode that does a poor job of subtly setting the table; I anticipate that as the season develops, the episodes to come will evade these problems by emphasizing the show’s creative strengths (confusion and chaos—disorientation amid unkept narratives) and by presenting character development that actually works (see: Arya and The Hound circa season four, Jaime Lannister during the first six seasons, ect.).
It should be clear that a season’s worth of “Dragonstones” would be inept television. But, on the off chance that the audience’s lowest common denominator was confused that “Dragonstone” was the season premiere, Daenerys Targaryen coolly queries, “Shall we begin?”
I anticipate that the coming episodes will be more subtle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Administrators keep changing their rationale for abolishing unrecognized final clubs and social groups, now suggesting a ban on the groups in the name of inclusion. Don’t fret, though: You can feel outraged about the newest proposal for all the old reasons. Harvard discarding all pretenses of caring about students’ civil liberties? Check: “Dean Khurana has clearly abdicated any position of principle with respect to freedom of association,” one student told The New York Times. The administration’s participating in a large-scale abandonment of democratic values? Make it two for two: “Just because the rest of the world is finding authoritarianism more congenial than personal freedom,” former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 wrote, “doesn’t mean Harvard has to follow suit.” If each special committee report calls for harsher condemnation, then we risk running out of critical material.
For most people, authoritarians are always the administrators who take the other side of a given debate. But in concrete terms, what seems to concern these self-styled defenders of student freedoms is an uneasiness with the College punishing students who hold opinions contrary to its own. “Is membership in the Republican Party less an affront to ‘our deepest values’ than membership of the Fly?” Professor Lewis, along with three colleagues, asked last year. Other critics have echoed this sentiment: Students, wrote former Undergraduate Council president Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 about the initial sanctions, “are now being taught that it is acceptable to threaten and silence those who have different social and political beliefs than they do.”
These criticisms of social engineering on the part of faculty are both inspiring—my local ACLU chapter is applauding somewhere—and badly misleading. First, rights of assembly and association are usually tied to the protection of unpopular or controversial speech. If you dusted off your AP US History flashcards in search of restricted associations, your historical paradigms might include American communists and NAACP chapters.
By contrast, most social groups on our campus, and final clubs in particular, are not facilitators of endangered, anti-establishment voices. Whatever unpopularity they garner with students isn’t the product of relentless and provocative social activism. Nor are many social clubs dedicated to providing a home for otherwise neglected religious or cultural groups—another kind of constitutional protection which isn’t really at issue here.
Don’t abandon your eloquent defense of First Amendment rights, but note a further, more fundamental problem with constitutional comparisons: National and educational contexts call for appropriately tailored arguments. It seems clear that private educational institutions can impose burdens on students that would be entirely unacceptable in other contexts.
The federal government has no business telling me what language to speak, for example, but a language immersion program may very well prohibit participants from speaking their native tongue, even when leaving campus or calling friends and family—a policy that reaches well beyond the classroom. And what justifies such restrictions is, of course, the aim of establishing a learning community that devotes itself to effective foreign language instruction.
Debating the suggested ban on social groups requires the same attention to (a) the mission of the College and (b) whether or not the specific proposal best advances it. Some critics of the administration, like Psychology Professor Steven Pinker, understand Harvard’s purpose to include classroom instruction, research, and not much else. But many of us see value in the College’s actual, officially-stated mission, as often espoused by Dean Khurana,“to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society”—leaders who are shaped for better and for worse by the social relationships that define college life. If the College is right to adopt a broadly civic mission, and final clubs or Greek organizations negatively impact the kind of “citizen-leaders” it graduates, then in principle that opens the door for attempts to restructure, curb, or even ban those influences altogether.
You might argue that final clubs and Greek life don’t dilute or distract from the College’s mission. And none of this is to say that the proposed ban would intelligently accomplish its objectives in practice, however legitimate its goals. As demonstrated by the hundreds of sorority and female final club members who protested sanctions last year, many unrecognized social groups reflect a failure on the part of the University to create communities for students who instead find them in off-campus spaces.
But with those caveats in mind, we should put soaring denunciations of the ban in perspective. Does this policy spell the end of principled freedom of association on our campus? Probably not, especially with any good understanding of that freedom in our university-specific context. Does the committee’s work send the College hurtling towards authoritarianism alongside the rest of the Western world? We should always remain vigilant, but I think apocalypse will require a few more faculty task forces.

“THIS IS SO GOOD!!! I NEED MORE QUEER ARTISTS WRITING SONGS ABOUT QUEER ROMANCE!!!﻿”
“This song is so important to me. It's helped me realize my sexuality... So in 2016, in June, in pride month, I just wanna say, I'm pansexual and proud.﻿”
“AS A GAY, I FEEL VALIDATED. VALIGAYTED.”
“I’m transgender. This video makes me really really happy. I don't even care if I get called a slur in the comments, I love this video and it's important﻿”
“Les bi an honest group of people, this is awesome﻿”
“I'm gay and I approve this gay message with my gay heart﻿”
“Seeing that someone changed the pronouns to she/she (girl to girl) makes me really emotional and I am really happy for this kind of representation in this song. Thank you”
“You've managed to eloquently put into words what I've been trying to explain to myself for most of my life. You have a way with words”
***
I love reading through the comments on queer music videos. It’s like all the queer people come out of the woodwork to squeal in all-caps or leave long novels about how the song spoke to them.
The first song that spoke to my queer little heart is actually not queer at all, by any standard. I remember listening to the radio in middle school and feeling all warm and fuzzy whenever “Nothin’ On You” came on, especially during Bruno Mars’ part. Who were these beautiful girls all over the world? Why did they remind me of girls that I knew? And why did I feel the sudden urge to chase them? These were questions that wouldn’t be answered until years later. (For the record, I still love this song and get the same feeling while listening to it now as I did seven years ago.)
I spent the rest of middle school subconsciously projecting my gayness onto straight songs. It wasn’t until the release of “Same Love” that I began to recognize overt queerness in music. I still thought I was straight at the time, but something about hearing Mary Lambert sing the line “She keeps me warm” over and over both shocked and resonated with me. When I finally came out to myself a year later, Mary’s voice was the only thing that could calm me down on the nights when I struggled to breathe because I was so overwhelmed by fear. Even though I’m in a much better place mentally right now, “Same Love” continues to calm me with the reminder that hate will never win and things will be okay.
I always get excited when I find out an artist is queer or when new queer music gets released. I teared up when I learned that my favorite singer, Lauren Jauregui from Fifth Harmony, came out as bi last fall. And I had an out-of-body experience while listening to “Strangers,” her duet with Halsey. Each verse by Halsey or Lauren begins with the pronoun “she,” and with each “she,” I felt my soul lift up a little higher into a rainbow paradise. Yeah, I know it’s just one little word, but there’s something so refreshing and validating about hearing one of your role models give voice to a part of your identity—especially if that part almost never appears in popular culture.
There’s a wide variety of queer music out there, and listeners can connect with it in different ways. Some songs address anti-LGBTQ hate, such as Troye Sivan’s “Talk Me Down,” which highlights the harmful effects of homophobia from parents and the risk of suicide. Others express the small nuances in many queer experiences, such as Hayley Kiyoko’s song “Sleepover” about her unrequited crush on a (presumably straight) friend who’s a girl. As someone who has fallen for countless straight girls, the line “Even when you’re next to me / it’s not the way I’m picturing” brings back a lot of memories. And while the lack of gendered pronouns in the song means that it could be sung by a straight girl who likes a straight guy (also known as the plot of nearly every rom-com in existence), the music video and corresponding interview with Hayley confirm that it is indeed about two girls. Knowing that it’s actually about two girls adds an extra layer of meaning for me. It’s a song written and performed by someone who gets it—who can capture how I feel.
And then there are the iconic anthems that the LGBTQ community can rally around; Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way” is one that comes to mind. I’ll admit, I used to not like this song in middle school and never listened to it in its entirety until years later, so I completely missed how queer the whole thing is. However, I’ve since seen the error of my ways and now wholeheartedly embrace being “beautiful in my way / ‘Cause God makes no mistakes.”
If you’re looking for more music to add to your playlist, I asked some of my queer friends to send me their requeermendations. Here they are: Tegan and Sara, the Indigo Girls, Allison Weiss, Christine and the Queens, Elton John, Big Freedia, Frank Ocean, and Shamir. And, of course, I hope you check out the artists I previously mentioned: Mary Lambert, Troye Sivan, Lady Gaga,  Halsey,  and, my personal favorite, Lauren Jauregui (who I hope releases more queer songs!).
I’ve yet to go through all of their music, but what I’ve heard so far has made me feel empowered, heard, and included.
I feel valigayted indeed.
