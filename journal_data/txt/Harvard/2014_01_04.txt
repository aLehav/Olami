After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the rest of the College off for break, The Back Page is keeping up with the Harvard men’s basketball team (12-1) as it finishes the remainder of its nonconference schedule. In the fourth in a series of running previews about the upcoming nonconference opponents, David Freed looks at Rice.
After going 24-6 in 2012, the Crimson opened 2013 the way it finished the previous year, extending its winning streak to eight with a 73-58 victory over Boston College, its sixth straight in the series. In one of its final nonconference games before the Ivy League season opener Jan. 11 against Dartmouth, Harvard travels south to take on the Rice Owls (5-7).
Coach
Although Harvard coach Tommy Amaker won his 300th game against Boston College, his counterpart on Sunday has won twice as many contests. Owls coach Ben Braun is one of 12 active Division I coaches who have posted at least 600 career victories. Before his current six-year stint at Rice, Braun coached for 12 years at the University of California, leading the Golden Bears to five NCAA tournaments, including a Sweet 16 appearance in 1998.
Since arriving at Rice, however, Braun has struggled to find consistent success. After leading the Owls to their first winning campaign in eight years two seasons ago, the program struggled to integrate a host of new starters last year and stumbled to a 5-26 record. Similarly, after bringing in a top-three mid-major recruiting class in 2008, Braun and the Owls have failed to attract similar talent in subsequent classes.
Roster
Leading the Owl attack will be freshman forward Sean Obi, who averages nearly 12 points and nine-and-a-half rebounds a game, shooting 60 percent from the field. Rice likes to space the floor with Obi in the middle, with three point threats guard Austin Ramiljak (12.8 ppg, 43.1 percent shooting from behind the arc) and forward Seth Gearhart (7.3 ppg, 18 made threes) keeping opponents honest.
The Owls can score the ball with aplomb, shooting 33.4 percent from behind the arc and scoring over 67 points a game. The problem for the team comes on the defensive end, where it allows opponents to shoot almost 35 percent from three point land (42 percent overall) and score almost 69 points a game. A small starting lineup—only Obi averages over five boards on the team—and a tendency for spouts of turnovers (nearly 15 a game) are the chief causes of the team’s middling defense.
Nonconference Play
 
The Owls’ current losing record is more reflective of an inability to win close games than game-to-game competitiveness. Rice has lost five times by three points or fewer, including a close decision on the road against Texas A&M. It has yet to notch a signature win, with its best victory so far being a road victory over Texas A&M Corpus Christi. Most interesting to Harvard fans, however, may be Rice’s 14-point loss at home to the Princeton Tigers, one of the Crimson’s chief challengers for the 2014 Ivy title.
 
Series History
Last year, coming off a one-point loss to St. Mary’s, the Crimson thrashed the Owls by 30 at home, 92-62. Then-junior Laurent Rivard knocked down five three pointers in the contest, and Harvard posted its highest points total of the year.
The 2013 victory was Harvard’s second consecutive win in the series, dating back to an 85-64 win over the Owls in December 2009. Both contests took place at Lavietes Pavilion, however, where Harvard has not lost since 2012. The last time the Crimson visited Houston, the team fell, 67-63, in December 2008.
 
Overall Matchup
Since last year, much has changed for the two squads. The Crimson came into last season’s matchup at Lavietes Pavilion with a 6-5 record and has run off a 26-6 streak since that game. Heading on the road, where Harvard has won all but one game this year, will not scare the experienced Crimson, which should take care of a subpar Rice squad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes David really does slay Goliath. Despite competing against three nationally ranked teams in the 50th Asics Invitational Tournament hosted by the University of California at Santa Barbara, the Harvard men’s volleyball team came out on top of its five-team grouping.
The Crimson won three matches on its first day of play, beating No. 5 Stanford, No. 8 UCSB and University of the Pacific. The team’s only loss came at the hands of No. 15 California Baptist.
Harvard’s 3-1 record places the team in the championship match Saturday night at the Thunderdome against the winner of the second pool, No. 4 Long Beach State.
“I think we came out pretty good, especially because it’s so early in the year,” co-captain Chris Gibbons said. “Usually we’re not playing matches this early. We’ve only had nine practices since we came back from winter break. All the guys were happy about the way we played and the teams we beat, and so were our coaches.”
The Crimson got off to a quick start, beating Stanford in two straight games, 29-27 and 25-20, in the best-of-three-games format of the tournament’s opening round.
“Stanford is usually a team [with which] we’re competing for players given they’re on the same caliber academically,” Gibbons said. “We’ve lost quite a few recruits to Stanford, so it was nice getting the win against them our first time playing them.”
According to co-captain Nick Madden, several participants in the UCSB tournament have played against one another before, providing another source of motivation.
“The west coast has a lot of good beach volleyball, and club volleyball too, so a lot of our recruits are from out here, especially from the senior class,” Madden said. “It feels great to be beating them. Not only guys that would have come to Harvard, but guys that all of us played against growing up who played club volleyball. It gets really competitive, and a really intense rivalry.”
After defeating Stanford, the Crimson went on to face Pacific and prevailed in just two games once again, 27-25 and 25-19.
Harvard’s third and final morning match came against Cal Baptist. After falling in the first set, 23-25, the Crimson bounced back to win the second game by the same score. But the team could not keep up the momentum in the third set, falling by a score of 15-10.
“We played a ton of volleyball today, so getting energy for every game was a big challenge,” Madden said. “I think we mainly lost because it was our third game in a row, and we were pretty exhausted by the third game of the third match.”
The Crimson went on to play UCSB in the afternoon and got off to a slow start in the first set, falling by a score of 11-25. But Harvard bounced back quickly and rallied to win the second game, 25-20, and prevailed by a tight 18-16 margin in the final set of play. Harvard hadn’t faced the Gauchos since being swept by Santa Barbara last spring.
“It was nice to get that victory, especially given the first game,” Gibbons said. “They sort of dominated the first game, so it was a testament to the focus of the team and the fortitude that we had in order to come back and win those next two sets to take the match. I think we’re showing some good signs of what’s to come in the season pretty early on.”
The Crimson, which went 18-9 last season, enters 2014 returning nearly all its starters, along with the addition of three freshmen who have already made significant contributions on the court.
“We’re looking to have another strong year,” Gibbons said. “[Freshman center] Nick Bendell has come in to play a big role in taking over the setting game. We have a good senior class; we’re looking to have a good year and a lot of good underclassmen that are working hard to support it. The freshmen have been adjusting really well to jumping into college volleyball and having fantastic games so far.”
The Crimson did not play in UCSB’s invitational tournament last year, but hoped experiencing high level volleyball would prepare the team for the season to come by exposing the athletes to different styles of play.
“I think we had been practicing really well, so we were expecting that we were going to come out hard,” Gibbons said. “We were able to take advantage that Stanford didn’t have the best game against us, and we made fewer errors on our side. We came out confident, we came out playing hard, and we were able to beat some pretty good teams.”

Even with the new year in full swing, Flyby has been reflecting a lot on 2013 and all that it brought to campus. From an email search scandal to a bomb scare, this year at Harvard certainly had its interesting moments. With a critical eye, we took some time to think over these past twelve months and come up with a few resolutions for the Harvard community in 2014.Stay Above Average?In December, The Crimson reported that the median grade awarded at Harvard College is an A-, confirming to the rest of the world once again that we are a bunch of elitist snobs coddled by a nannying administration that is beholden to paranoid, success-driven parents. Not only this, but Harvard also neglected to demand the capital of Canada on its admissions application, resulting in eleven students who could not name the answer, Ottawa, correctly. While there probably isn’t much we can do to remedy our bad public image, in 2014 we Harvard students should pledge to play this world geography game as a procrastination tool, and slack off to earn a B+ in at least one class to make Princeton feel better about itself.Let Them Eat Tomato Basil Ravioli SoupThis November, the UC “joke ticket” Sam B. Clark ‘15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ‘15 won their first revolutionary victory for the proletariat by inspiring HUDS to bring the much-ballyhooed tomato basil ravioli soup to Harvard dining halls every Thursday. In 2014, we hope this weekly holiday inspires the new UC President Mayopoulos to follow through on his pledge to engage a heretofore aloof UC aristocracy with the concerns of the working student. We’re counting on you Gus; save us from the single-ply.Reclaim GloryForget Yale. In 2013, Harvard was beaten out by two other elite institutions who now claim a lower acceptance rate. Stanford University and Walmart, Inc, with admissions rates of 5.69% and 2.6%, respectively, beat out Harvard College’s 5.8% acceptance rate for the Class of 2017. Not to be permanently dampened by this ego blow, Harvard University launched a five-year capital campaign to raise $6.5 billion and one-up Stanford’s measly $6.2 billion. This coming year, we can all support Harvard’s quest to be the Queen Bee of higher education by showing up to an alumni thankathon for pizza and a free tee shirt. No word yet as to how we approach Walmart’s $466 billion in revenues.Make Peace Between STEM and the HumanitiesIn 2013, shots were fired between humanities naysayers and those struggling to save art, literature, and languages from the age of science and pre-investment-banking economics concentrators. While the appeal of math and science for future job prospects is undeniable, some of us need to be reminded that we attend a liberal arts school where esotericism and impracticality should be celebrated. In 2014, we propose to hold a peace conference in a neutral location (Panera, anyone?) to settle differences between the opposing sides.Show Some School SpiritBelieve it or not, Harvard has a world-class Division I varsity athletics program. This year the Harvard men’s basketball showed us how talented and hard-working Harvard athletes are by winning their first-ever NCAA tournament game. Sadly, many Harvard students would rather spend an evening in Lamont than trek across the river for a friend’s varsity sports match. Harvard has even tried paying students in Crimson Cash to attend games. Come on people, we are not Columbia. Let’s show Harvard athletics our support by showing up to at least one sports game next semester.Kick Off the New Years Fitness Regimen by Walking to the Relocated Dunkin’ DonutsSeptember brought a wave of shock as it was revealed that the hallowed Bow Street Dunkin’ Donuts of “Good Will Hunting” fame was set to close. After a month of turmoil and soul-searching by a grief-ridden student body, we learned that Dunkin’ would in fact relocate to a new location one-third of a mile down the road at 1003 Massachusetts Avenue. While this new spot is certainly less convenient for upperclassmen craving a Dunkaccino on the way to class, it presents a great opportunity to kick-start any New Years fitness resolutions to get in shape by taking an aerobic detour to rev up an early-morning metabolism.
