After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the last few years, Harvard has taken numerous bold steps to create a more environmentally friendly campus, and the recent move to convert all of its grounds to organic grass is another impressive initiative. What started as a one-acre pilot project is now slated to be a full organic overhaul, an encouraging sign that the university is willing to seize worthy ideas that help the environment and save money.
In essence, Harvard is transforming the way it maintains all of its properties. Instead of using synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, the gardeners now employ the natural organisms and processes of the soil for nourishment and replenishment. This change avoids the harmful effects of chemicals while also reducing the use of irrigation, saving two million gallons of water a year. In addition, the new growing methods have turned around the health of plants afflicted with serious diseases, such as the orchards at Elmwood, which were suffering from leaf spot and apple scab.
Harvard’s grass initiative is not only helping preserve the environment but also cutting unnecessary costs. The savings from reduced water usage and from composting the grass clippings, branches, leaves, and other material that used to have to be transported off campus amounts to $35,000 a year. In addition, now that Harvard is composting its own materials, it no longer has to buy fertilizers, saving another $10,000 a year. In a time of budgetary constraints for colleges throughout the country, not to mention our nation as a whole, Harvard is continually demonstrating that reducing our environmental footprint and saving money do not have to be mutually exclusive; rather, they are complimentary.
As with all institutions, there is still more Harvard can do to preserve the environment. Steps including turning off sprinklers during rainstorms, automatically placing computers on standby mode when unused, and increasing vegetarian dining choices can further reduce our footprint and help us achieve President Faust’s goal of reducing Harvard’s greenhouse-gas footprint 30 percent by 2016. That being said, creative ideas such as changing the treatment of our grass are encouraging signs that we will reach, if not surpass, this target.

Although the Class of 2027 can still not be certain of having hot breakfasts, they can now rest more assured knowing they will probably not be living in walk-throughs during their time at Harvard. The College administration renewed its commitment to start its 15-year project to renovate the upperclassman houses by 2012 this week. While seemingly everything else at this university is suffering from cutbacks as a result of the budget hardships brought about by the financial crisis, it’s encouraging to see that this project will continue on schedule.
In light of the fact that the university has experienced a 30 percent drop in its endowment and a decline in tuition and donation revenue, it is admirable that it has managed to keep financing for the housing project in order. We have been told repeatedly over the past few weeks that recovery from the financial fallout will not be rapid or easy. It is heartening that, despite this reality, the university remains committed to this massive endeavor.
This is welcome news since, as guided by the Housing Renewal Report released last spring, the proposed renovations promise to help address many of Harvard’s most pressing issues. Notably, the remodeling attends to the lack of social spaces within houses. Dining halls will no longer be the only place to hold large functions, and the Junior Common Rooms will no longer be the only student “hangout” space in the house. Aside from improving social spaces, many of the report’s recommendations, such as eliminating walk-throughs, remodel Harvard’s archaic designs in ways that ensure greater student privacy and well-being.
The reaffirmation of the construction schedule means that at least some current freshmen will sleep under a newly renovated roof before they graduate. Many current students were involved in the creation of the report. Even more students have discussed or debated housing renewal at some point. Therefore, it is an exciting prospect that our generation of Harvard students will have a tangible connection to its realization.
Of course, the College must not forget that housing renovations must be coupled with the creation of desirable swing space. No student should feel as if they cannot partake in house life because of the unlucky timing of their college years. Housing renewal need not come at the expense of a satisfactory living experience for some students.
Housing renewal is a promising investment in the future and it is encouraging that it will move forward as planned.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a cold night in November 2008, the cheers of almost a quarter of a million people echoed around Grant Park, Chicago. For some, Barack Obama’s election heralded a turning point in America’s history, while for others the election of this 47-year-old man marked the ascendancy of Generation X. Looking back on that historic day, two things stand out: First, I have never seen so much passion and fervor surrounding an election. Second, despite this enthusiasm, voter turnout remained woefully low. In fact, only around a third of Americans actually voted Obama in.
A timeline has been established. In January 2010, an elected representative will replace Senator Paul G. Kirk Jr. ’60, the interim replacement for the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56. The Massachusetts senatorial race will be the first major election since November 4, 2008. We will have a unique opportunity to build on the excitement surrounding the presidential election and translate this into a high voter turnout. Why does voter turnout matter? I would argue that high voter turnout is one of the essential ingredients for a vibrant democratic society for three reasons.
Firstly, a high voter turnout is the only way of ensuring that our democratically elected representatives truly represent the majority. There’s no doubt that President Obama’s victory was resounding. Fifty two percent of all voters supported him. However, it transpires that, even in that most exceptional presidential election of 2008, only 64 percent of eligible voters actually turned out to vote. The outcome was that only around one in three Americans actually voted for President Obama. This is not a new phenomenon; low voter turnout may be regarded as the norm rather than the exception in presidential elections. Indeed, voter turnout in 2008, at 64 percent, appears to have been the highest for a generation. Likewise, it is not an issue unique to the U.S. Many of the world’s largest and wealthiest democracies have seen a similar gradual decline in voter turnout. This needs to be addressed so that future governments can claim with conviction that they truly are acting on behalf of the people when enacting major reforms, whether that is reform related to health-care or carbon emissions.
Secondly, those who do not vote tend to be the most deprived and disadvantaged members of society. The reasons are both cultural and logistical. Logistically, it can be difficult to get to a polling station while cultural reasons include voter fatigue, cynicism, and sense of alienation. Whatever the reason, the end result is the same. Low voter turnout in these vulnerable sections of society results in their under-representation in government, reinforcing their feeling of disenfranchisement.
Finally, we could regard voting as a civic duty in recognition of the past and ongoing sacrifices made by men and women in the name of democracy. The struggle for universal suffrage has been both long and turbulent. It began in 1775 with the War of Independence and it continues to this very day. In many parts of the world, people are still denied the right to vote on the basis of gender and race.
The people of Australia, a country that bears many cultural, geographic, and demographic similarities to the U.S., realized the problems surrounding low voter turnout and introduced compulsory voting in 1925. All men and women of voting age are legally required to register at a polling station on the day of elections and have their opinion counted. The result is a turnout that is consistently greater than 90 percent.
So what can the inhabitants of this leafy corner of Massachusetts do about low voter turnout? In the longer term, we need to debate measures such as the introduction of compulsory voting. However, regarding the senatorial election on January 19, 2010, we need to publicize the election in papers such as The Harvard Crimson and on student radio and television stations. But our efforts should not begin and end at the Charles River. We should be knocking on doors and handing out fliers encouraging people to turn out and vote regardless of their political hue. By doing this, we’ll be playing a small but important part in encouraging the notion of a government of all the people, by all the people, for all the people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is a shame that Libyan despot Muammar al-Qaddafi, while pontificating in front of the General Assembly this past week about how swine flu originated in a weapons lab, how the Kennedy assassination should be reinvestigated, and how Israel and Palestine should merge to become the nation of “Isratine,” also proposed reforming the United Nations Security Council—not because the concern was unwarranted, but exactly because it deserves attention. The fact that the world’s most powerful security body leaves billions under its purview without real representation is not just fodder for a madman’s ramblings. It is a true scandal, one that the body’s current members should feel an obligation to address.
Upon the UN’s founding, selection of the council’s five permanent members seemed straightforward. Ultimate control would rest with the nations that collectively won the war leading to the body’s creation—to wit, the U.S., U.K., France, the Chinese nationalists, and the Soviet Union. Historically speaking, this was to be expected. Traditionally, the victors of a conflict claim a key stake in any postwar order, a major spoil of victory. As a matter of justice, the legitimacy of this norm certainly warrants debate, but it at least made historical sense.
However, as the years wore on, it became increasingly clear that the council, now charged with preventing a breed of war different from World War II, would likewise face conflicts that involved a different set of nations. As the political scientist John Mueller believes, major war is obsolescent and nearing extinction regardless of the UN’s efforts. Instead, intrastate warfare dominates as of late. Since 1940, the number of ongoing civil wars has skyrocketed, not because more nations experience them, but because the conflicts’ average duration has increased markedly. Meanwhile, state-level security efforts focus less on preventing war and more on limiting the development of specific weapons, most notably nuclear and ballistic missile systems.
The UN has adapted to this shift more successfully than one might suspect. For instance, multiple analyses of the UN peacekeeping system have found it to be quite effective at nationbuilding, and certainly much more effective than the U.S. military. Meanwhile, the UN has helped organize the international treaty system that now bans or limits the use and stockpiling of nuclear, chemical, biological, cluster, and landmine weaponry and created institutions like the International Atomic Energy Agency to help enforce these norms.
The problem arises when enforcement is necessary. Peacekeeping is only possible when the country in question accepts intervention voluntarily, which leaves the people of any given nation at the mercy of their government. When the UN began debating a “responsibility to protect” doctrine to remedy this and provide a framework for protecting populations (militarily and otherwise) from their governments, developing nations reacted swiftly. In the words of former General Assembly president Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, the doctrine brought to mind “recent and painful memories related to the legacy of colonialism.” And rightly so: Under the current UN charter, the decision to intervene in this manner effectively rests in the hands of five major powers. The legitimacy of a system that lets the rich and well-armed come together and intervene wherever they please, while giving no voice to the regions where these interventions will likely take place, is questionable at the very least.
A similar problem arises in questions of disarmament. The IAEA proved most effective when nations wanted to dismantle their nuclear stockpile of their own volitions, as occurred in post-apartheid South Africa. When a state requires coercive measures like sanctions to deter it, the Security Council must grant approval. Given that the five nations with veto power are also the world’s five biggest nuclear powers and can explicitly play by different rules under the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty, this is a bit like trying DWI cases in front of a jury of drunkards. A state developing nuclear weapons could be forgiven for refusing to take orders from nations guilty of the same crime many times over.
There are many possible ways for the council to reconfigure its membership to make its decisions more legitimate. Including large nations from currently unrepresented regions, like India, Indonesia, and Brazil, would be a good first start. However, not only do we need more members, but we also need a new membership system that prevents against this lack of representation for whole continents in the future. Further, limiting or eliminating veto power so as to give rotating members a real say is a must. Convincing the Permanent Five to relinquish their grasp on the council will not be easy, but it is essential if the UN is to remain a body that the whole world can take seriously.

Harvard Divinity School Student Ari Schwarzberg marked the final day of the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur yesterday by challenging his audience to measure up to their potential in keeping with the spirit of the holiday at the Law School’s Pound Hall.
Delivered before a group of about 30 people, Schwarzberg’s lecture, entitled “Sefer Yonah: The Climax of the High Holidays,” explored the significance of the story of the prophet Yonah on a day known by Jews as the Day of Atonement.
“It is a day of prayer, a day of fasting,” said the first-year Divinity School student in an interview after the event. “All work is forbidden. We simply atone for our sins during the past year.”
The story of the prophet Yonah is traditionally read during the second-to-last service of Yom Kippur, according to Schwarzberg. Still, the Divinity School student said yesterday that it was “not often obvious” why the story had been chosen for the holiday and that he wanted to explore its “intellectual depth.”
Called by God to tell the city of Ninevah to repent, Yonah famously ran away on a ship only to be swallowed by a large fish.
When he finally did deliver God’s message, the story goes, the Ninevites repented, but Yonah was upset that God forgave them.
Audience members agreed that the story related to Yom Kippur because of its theme of repentance. On Yom Kippur, Jews strive to achieve “teshuva,” or “atonement.”
“God is teaching that he has a merciful side as well,” Schwarzburg said.
He also cited Abraham Maslow, an American psychologist who wrote about the “Jonah [Yonah] Complex.”
“We fear our highest possibilities,” Schwarzberg said, quoting the psychologist’s words. “We are generally afraid to become that which we can glimpse in our most perfect moment.”
“I hope that I have conveyed that Yom Kippur is really about people realizing their potential,” Schwarzberg said.
Schwarzberg holds a B.A. in Jewish Studies from Yeshiva College and an M.S. in Jewish Education from the Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education. He received his rabbinic ordination from Yeshiva University.
“It is one of the necessary keys to be a leader of the Jewish people,” Schwarzberg said of being a rabbi. “I grew up in the Jewish tradition, and [it has] the potential to create an amazing morality-centered community.”
Yesterday’s lecture was organized by Harvard Hillel.
“Ari is an outgoing, articulate and knowledgeable member of the Orthodox minyan,” wrote Rabbi Benjamin C. Greenberg, one of the event’s organizers, in an e-mail. “I invite members of the community and visiting scholars-in-residence to address the Orthodox minyan and more broadly the larger Hillel population regularly.”

Harvard University Health Services reported about 50 new cases of students with influenza-like illnesses during the period of September 12-18, placing Harvard at the national average for new flu infections on college campuses.
The nationwide infection rate for the period of September 12-18 was 24.7 cases per 10,000 students, according to the American College Health Association, while the Harvard rate was about 25.1 cases per 10,000 students for the same period.
But Harvard’s levels were far above the 3.9 cases per 10,000 students rate for Massachusetts during the week ending September 18.
There were about 50 new cases at Harvard last week as well, said UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59. Almost 70 percent of those new cases are undergraduates, he said.
The nationwide numbers for last week are not being released until Thursday, according to the American College Health Association.
UHS is closely watching for any changes in the number of new cases. Twice every weekday, Rosenthal meets with UHS’s chief of medicine, a College representative, and others by conference call to go over the numbers.
“Obviously, the question is: is there going to be a peak as the weather gets colder?” Rosenthal said. “We’ll just have to wait and see, but we’re monitoring it very closely.”
UHS has been following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to isolate those with influenza-like illnesses. UHS has not been testing to differentiate between H1N1 and regular seasonal flu this school year upon recommendation from the Mass. Department of Public Health, instead treating all patients who present with flu-like symptoms similarly.
Stillman Infirmary can accommodate up to 15 people, sick students with single bedrooms are sent back to their rooms, and undergraduates with family within two to three hours of campus are sent home to recover, Rosenthal said.
UHS has also identified 38 empty bedrooms around campus in which to isolate sick students who do not have single bedrooms.
Harvard University Dining Services delivers meals to the bedrooms of students who are in isolation.

Brookings Institute Visiting Fellow Dennis C. Wilder discussed what President Obama should keep in mind during his November visit to Beijing yesterday during the first in a series of workshops on Chinese politics and foreign policy at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies.
Speaking to an engaged and well-informed audience, the former senior director for East Asian affairs for the National Security Council said that he believed in a “constructive, cooperative, and candid” relationship with China.
Drawing on his experience while working closely with President George W. Bush, Wilder addressed a wide range of U.S.-China policy issues including North Korea, Iran, Tibet, the economy, Chinese nationalism, and the military.
Wilder said that he was impressed by Bush’s “straight talk” with Chinese leaders and noted that since the Beijing Olympics last year, there has been a “large degree of transition and maturity that came into the relationship” between the U.S. and China.
He spoke critically of the new U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, a forum to discuss strategic and economic issues of importance for both nations in which each country sends high-level representatives and delegations to meet annually in either Beijing or Washington D.C.
Wilder also warned that establishing a G2 summit between the two states may prove upsetting to other East Asian countries.
“The center of gravity in international trade has really shifted from the European side...to the East Asian side,” he said. “This isn’t only the story of China.” He added that China’s success is “built on the fabric of the emergence of East Asia.”
In an interview after his workshop, Wilder said that he would recommend that institutions of higher education like Harvard reinstate training programs like those present during the 1980s that allowed military officers from China to visit and experience America.
Wilder’s expertise drew many non-Harvard students—including Chris J. Murray, a student at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University—to the workshop.
Murray said that considering Wilder’s background, it was a “no brainer” to attend.
“It’s very easy for the US-China relationship to come to blows,” he said. “It’s important to gain knowledge in terms of how they work.”

Unpredictable changes in class enrollment this year have confounded the process of assigning section leaders for the fall semester, drawing out professors’ concerns about larger section sizes.
Facing a projected budgetary deficit of $220 million last year, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences had planned this spring to cut 8 to 10 percent of the College’s section leaders for the fall semester, which was projected to save around $2 million, according Logan S. McCarty, assistant dean of Harvard College. But because of changes in enrollment, it remains unclear four weeks into the semester how much money will actually be saved or how section sizes will change.
“There is a lot of confusion and uncertainty about how large the sections will be,” said History Department Chair Lizabeth Cohen in an interview with The Crimson during shopping week.
Part of last spring’s budget plan had called for the hiring of fewer teaching assistants—section leaders who are otherwise unaffiliated with Harvard, as opposed to teaching fellows. Average section sizes were expected to creep upwards, closer to a long-standing target of 18 students, which, according to McCarty, is frequently undershot.
But with the new General Education curriculum now mandatory for freshmen, course enrollments in existing classes have seen dramatic shifts from prior years, and figures for new classes has proven difficult to predict.
Core classes have seen the most marked decreases in enrollment. Though McCarty said that decreased enrollment was expected, some courses dropped precipitously.
History Cores such as Historical Study A-13: “China: Traditions and Transformations” and Historical Study B-61: “The Warren Court and the Pursuit of Justice, 1953-1969” dropped from 122 undergraduates to 77 and 233 to 141, respectively.
Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, whose introductory course Social Analysis 10 attracts hundreds of students each year, saw his enrollment decrease by nearly 10 percent from last year.
“The natural hypotheses are the Gen Ed requirements and recent macroeconomic conditions, as well as mere random variation,” he wrote in an e-mail when asked about the reasons for the downturn. “But I am not at all sure how to sort out which of these hypotheses is correct.”
Meanwhile, a new Gen Ed course co-taught by McCarty—Science of the Physical Universe 20: “What is Life? From Quarks to Consciousness”—was almost three times as large as expected, he said.
McCarty said final numbers regarding TF and TA hirings and section sizes will not be available until late October, when class registration closes and departments have submitted their final requests.
For the time being, Cohen said, she is hoping that section sizes will not see a larger-than-desired increase.
“It is very hard to have sections do what sections should do at larger than 18,” Cohen said. “I’d hate to see them get larger.”

When the Dunster House library opened Sunday for the first time this year, every book was confined behind two silver metal bars—a development that drew criticism from residents and staff who say the bars will keep them from accessing the library’s books.
The new security measures follow concerns about book theft raised by House Master Ann Porter last week, according to Dunster tutor Jacob S. Jost, adding that the House Masters reiterated that concern at a meeting yesterday.
The surprise appearance of the bars—which are screwed into the sides of the bookshelves and are difficult to remove—sparked controversy over Dunster’s open list Sunday. None of the several Dunster House residents interviewed yesterday said they had heard of any problems with book theft.
“I’m just waiting for the Masters to say something,” said Dunster House resident Alyce M. de Carteret ’10. “It was very sudden.”
Neither Ann Porter nor Roger B. Porter—Dunster’s other House Master—responded to repeated requests for comment yesterday through interim House Administrator Brandon Edwards. The e-mail sent by the House Masters’ office announcing the library’s opening contained no mention of the new security measures.
It is unclear how long the bars might remain in place, though according to Jost, the Porters informed tutors yesterday that small numbers of non-valuable books will be placed on open shelves over time. Other Dunster House administrators declined to comment yesterday on the issue.
As of last night, the Dunster House Masters had not sent out an e-mail explaining the installation of the metal bars to students or house administrators.
Many students interviewed said they rarely entered the library, and most said they had never used the books there, though a few recounted taking a dictionary or an other reference book off the shelves.
The Dunster House Library is open from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. Monday through Thursday with alternate hours on the weekends and is staffed by a student desk attendant or its librarian, Martha Diaz. Its books are non-circulating and may only be taken out of the library with special permission. Unlike Lamont and Widener, there is no security system to prevent books from being stolen.
Although most of the books are not particularly valuable, the library’s collection was assembled by Dunster’s long-time librarian Charles F. Kletzsch over his more than 50 years with the House.
Now, some students say they’re concerned those books could remain behind bars for an extended period of time.
“I’ve always been for more bars in more places,” Daniel M. Alfino ’11 said. “I just don’t think they should be in the library.”

Harvard renegotiated terms to an agreement with a South Korean foundation yesterday that will loosen restrictions on a $13 million endowment established in 1975 for Korean studies.
The signed deal with the Sanhak Foundation—which was founded by the Korean International Traders Association to promote the nation’s economic development—marks Harvard’s first success in its shifting strategy to secure more flexible sources of funding, said Vice Provost for International Affairs Jorge I. Dominguez.
Under the original terms of the agreement, what Dominguez described as a “series of locking clauses” stipulated that the funds could only be used to endow a senior faculty member’s position in Korean studies at Harvard.
And because there is no endowed chair at present in this field, Harvard has been unable to use the payout from this endowment for a number of years. Endowing a full professorship at the University requires about $4 million.
The funds can now be used to support tenure-track faculty, visiting scholars in the department, and students studying the economy and society of modern Korea.
“For a number of reasons, the endowment got restricted in ways not anticipated when it was signed,” Dominguez said. “What is a fairly huge amount can now be deployed for other uses.”
In recent months, University administrators have taken steps to ensure that past gifts—which, like the Sanhak Foundation endowment, often come with strings attached—are flexible enough to accommodate changing needs over time.
Harvard officials are currently reevaluating whether similarly restrictive agreements signed in the past can be renegotiated to match available resources with current needs.
“We now have a more systematic process, since there ought to be a mechanism to scrutinize endowments,” Dominguez said of the Gift Policy Committee, which is chaired by University Provost Steven E. Hyman and has now absorbed these responsibilities.
These efforts had been underway before the financial crisis heightened the need to allocate current use of funds more efficiently, Dominguez said.
The deal with the Sanhak Foundation follows an agreement Harvard signed with the government of Chile last week that will provide enough financial support to nearly double the number of Chilean students across the University’s graduate schools to a total of 50 students.

Curry made its return to the Science Center yesterday as the building’s Greenhouse Café marked the reopening of Monsoon Kitchen—the Indian food vendor that had been closed for the summer months.
The occasion saw its share of festive decorations: a banner hung near the entrance to the area, and the counter was draped with a bright-colored tapestry and decked with small wood-carved elephants.
“I have lunch pretty frequently at Greenhouse because it is so convenient, and I wasn’t aware of the new Indian food before today until I saw the signs, so I will definitely try it in the future,” said Martha R. Farlow ’13, who said she frequents the café to study.
Over the summer, Monsoon Kitchen was provisionally replaced by American Barbecue, a dining option featuring Southern style food, according to Crista Martin, Harvard University Dining Services director for marketing and communications. The seasonally appropriate menu offered an assortment of meal options including barbecued chicken, broccoli, pulled pork, baked beans, coleslaw, corn on the cob, potato salad, and watermelon.
But the Monsoon Kitchen entrees and complements signal a return to a more ethnic flavor, pushing out picnic foods to make room for cultural cuisine. The new café station provides a selection for students that includes chicken samosas, vegetable samosas, pakoras, and naan bread.
“I remembered the Indian food from last year, and I knew they would bring it back eventually,” said Alejandra Duarte ’10 after a meal from Monsoon Kitchen. “I like this food because it’s a nice alternative to other choices at the Greenhouse Café that is not pizza or something fried.”
Martin said that Monsoon Kitchen was reintroduced to provide fresh options for the campus dining scene.
“Monsoon was simply a seasonal change for variety,” Martin said. “The students really like the Indian cuisine, so I am sure it will be well received.”
HUDS currently has no definitive plans for changing the dining station again in the future, Martin said, but for now, students can enjoy the new season with Indian seasonings.

In response to The Crimson's Sept. 29, 2009 news article "Ex-Grad Student Alleges Misconduct," Letters to the Editor were submitted by John Y. Campbell, department chair of the Harvard economics department; David Gergen, a professor of public service at the Harvard Kennedy School; Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economics professor; and a group of 68 graduate students and recent alumni from the economics department's PhD programs.
A former graduate student’s mass e-mail to hundreds of College students alleging “administrative misconduct” at Harvard sparked heated debate over undergraduate e-mail lists Friday about discrimination on campus.
Former economics graduate student Wei Gu sent a nearly 2,500 word e-mail Friday morning that alleged that she had been the victim of “significant discrimination and misconducts” at the hands of professors and administrators at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and the University.
Her e-mail in particular levied accusations of inappropriate conduct against Economics Professor Kenneth S. Rogoff, her adviser from 2005 to 2007.
“I rejected implicitly and politely his request to have a relationship more than student-faculty relationship in 2006,” Gu wrote in Friday’s e-mail. “There were also body languages and verbal harassment that I did not quite understand at that time.”
Rogoff declined to comment on the e-mail.
Gu said she was required to take an involuntary medical leave of absence on Aug. 9, 2007 and was required to withdraw from GSAS at the Aug. 31 Administrative Board meeting this year.
“I sent e-mails to students and professors because I had no other method to let people know what happened,” Gu said in a telephone interview from her Beijing home. “And I think students should work together to fight for their student rights.”
In response to an inquiry about Gu’s mass e-mail, a Harvard spokesman said that GSAS had already thoroughly considered Gu’s case and does not intend to reopen it.
“We emphasize that the GSAS and Harvard more broadly do not condone or tolerate harassment—physically, verbally, or electronically—of any member of our community,” Harvard spokesman Jeff Neal wrote in an e-mailed statement. “As is our policy, and consistent with privacy rules, we will not disclose the details of this former student’s case.”
Gu wrote that she believed professors “were aiming at the same goal to force me to leave US in summer 2007 and to withdraw me in 2009. I think it is because I decided to rely on my own research ability without compromising to the male dominated culture in the Economics Department.”
Following the reception of Gu’s e-mail, many house and club e-mail lists reacted with concerns about gender and racial discrimination on campus.
“The e-mail opens up a lot of room for misconceptions and misunderstandings, and judging from the confusion over the mailing lists, it already has,” said a recent Harvard alum who asked to remain anonymous to avoid compromising relationships with people in the economics department. “I really think that students should be cautious about jumping to conclusions.”
Gu’s e-mail also contained a link to her blog, where she posted what she identified as logs of her e-mail exchanges with various professors and administrators.
In one such exchange dated Nov. 3, 2006, Gu wrote to Rogoff, “I want to make sure that you know this. I am willing to be with you any time if it is not against my principles and integrity.”
In another e-mail sent Jan. 15, 2007, Rogoff wrote that “Given all that has happened recently, and that you now have other places to go for advice and advising, perhaps it would make sense if you do not write for an extended period.”
According to the e-mail logs, GSAS Dean for Students Garth O. McCavana wrote to Gu that further contact with Rogoff “could be construed as harassment and could end you up in trouble.”
Gu continued sending a series of e-mails to Rogoff from both her FAS account and an anonymous Gmail account, based on her logs.
According to the e-mails posted on Gu’s site, she was referred to University Health Services Chief of Mental Health Richard D. Kadison for “inappropriate and intrusive” behavior in June 2007 and was placed on involuntary medical leave in Aug. 2007 for a pattern of behavior that was “extremely disruptive to the academic environment.” Gu said she was required to leave the United States within two weeks.
In Aug. 2009, the Administrative Board of GSAS recommended against Gu returning to continue her studies, and Gu was required to withdraw, she said.
Students who accessed the e-mail logs expressed concerns about the accuracy of Gu’s portrayal.
“I felt that in many ways, how she portrayed herself [in the e-mail sent to students] was very different from how the reality might have been,” said Steve Teng ’10. “In some ways, I think she definitely crossed the line between personal and professional.”
A current Harvard graduate student who asked to remain anonymous because they did not want to compromise relationships with faculty members said that they could sympathize with Gu’s situation.
“I think the power balance for international graduate students is a little different,” the grad student said. “I don’t think the department acted at all inappropriately, but because she was an international student, the department held an enormous amount of power over her in the sense that they forced her to leave the country immediately.”
Friday’s e-mail was not the first time Gu had e-mailed allegations to Harvard students. According to the e-mail log on Gu’s site, she sent a series of e-mails to current and former students in the economics department in Aug. 2008. The e-mails contained allegations about both faculty and students in the department.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s likely that many a Harvard biology and psychology professor would love to debate the existence of an “athletic gene.”
Given a chance to enter into the debate, the coaches and players of the Crimson cross-country team would argue that there must be.
Considering the team’s strong evidence, those professors who believe there is no such thing may just have to concede defeat.
Cara Sprague and Claire Richardson are junior runners for Harvard, but what these teammates have in common—besides the track—is that they both have a younger brother on the team.
Kevin Sprague and Stewart Richardson are freshmen at Harvard this year and have joined their siblings on the Crimson’s roster. In Kevin’s case, he will also be nordic skiing for Harvard with Cara in the winter.
Claire, the women’s cross country captain, was named All-Regional in 2007 and 2008 as well as first-team All Ivy-League for outdoor track in 2008 and 2009 and indoor track in 2009. In addition, she has been named to ESPN The Magazine’s Academic All-District I second team and Academic All-Ivy League.
Cara has competed at the Harvard-Yale dual meet and the Heptagonal Championships.
She was also the top Harvard finisher and 17th overall at the University of Albany Invitational in 2009, and while neither of the younger siblings has had a chance to garner such success with only one collegiate race to their credit, the boys will rely on ample past experience running with the family.
Claire and Stewart both started running when they reached the seventh grade, while the Spragues have a tradition of hitting the pavement together.
“I started because the coach said, ‘you should come out and run’ when I was in middle school,” Claire said. “He did the same thing to Stewart. It’s been cool to be able to watch his [Stewart’s] progression.”
For their part, Cara and Kevin—the youngest of four children—have two older sisters, one of whom, Erin, graduated from Harvard in 2005 and yes, she ran track too.
“Our family ran, but it was never something our parents pushed us to do,” Cara explained. “We just kind of fell into it and really enjoyed it.”
“My dad was always into running,” Kevin added. “And our oldest sister, Erin, was an influence for us.”
Skiing was another family activity for the Spragues, who are from Queensbury, New York.
“Our family would go up every winter to Gore Mountain in North Creek [New York] and ski,” Cara said. “not only downhill, but cross country skiing as well. Kevin and I are the youngest, so we always paired up for things.”
When they got to middle school and high school, skiing was offered as a team sport, which allowed the Spragues to become even closer.
“Everyone who ran cross country [in high school] also skied cross country in the winter,” Cara said, “so [Kevin and I] hung out with the same group of friends.”
“Nordic skiing is a big sport for me,” Kevin added. “I was on two state championship teams during my junior and senior year in high school, after Cara graduated.”
Clearly, all four Crimson athletes were inspired to take up these sports by those close to them, but inevitably, the “nature vs. nurture” debate must come up.
Are these two sets of siblings genetically predetermined to be successful Harvard athletes? Or, rather, is it that an athletic family atmosphere has turned into a love for sports?
It seems that the Spragues just took a casual interest in running, but perhaps it does have something to do with family genes. Their great grandfather held a cross country record at Van Cortlandt Park in New York and qualified for the 1916 summer Olympics, which would have been held in Berlin, Germany, had it not been cancelled due to World War I.
The Spragues’ rich history has allowed Kevin not only to run for a Division I school, but also to enjoy the sport he loves with a sister he is very close to.
“I tried to keep my decision [of which college to attend] open,” Kevin said. “I approached it like any other school, and it turned out that I loved Cambridge and the running program.”
So is it nature or is it nurture that has brought these brothers and sisters along the same path?
Either way, both sets of siblings plan to make their mark on Crimson athletics, and Harvard cross-country is more than happy to keep it all in the family.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Collier Winters doesn’t like to talk about himself. But last Friday against Brown, there was no need. His performance spoke for itself.
The junior quarterback completed 18 of 27 passes for 223 yards and rushed for 66, throwing two touchdowns and running in a third.
He was recently named Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week for his efforts in Harvard’s 24-21 thrilling win against Brown on Friday.
It’s the kind of performance for which he’s been preparing since his namesake season, when snow covered the stadium bleachers and Crimson fans cried over Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09’s graduation.
“Press and media get caught up in the idea of us losing Chris Pizzotti,” captain Carl Ehrlich said. “Meanwhile, Collier’s been working out the whole time, and we’ve always had confidence in him.”
That work includes extra film review sessions and meetings with coaches, an everyday task for Winters.
“I don’t think I know anyone who works harder in terms of playbook and film preparation,” junior receiver Marco Iannuzzi said. “He definitely watches his DVDs a ton.”
As of last Friday, his work is no longer unnoticed.
Winters’ work on the field was characteristic of his personality—effective and efficient. He moved the chains, rather than gambling on big plays. He amassed his yardage numbers through short, smart passes, with a long of only 38. And he was successful at running the football.
“Not only he manage he can manage a game, and not only can he throw the ball, but he’s a legitimate threat to run,” Ehrlich said. “He’s a very athletic kid, [which] makes it doubly hard for defenses.”
And while the Ivy League is still learning about Winters’ abilities as a football player, there have never been any doubts in the Harvard locker room about his qualities as a teammate.
“A real humble kid,” Ehrlich said of Winters. “[He’s] quiet by nature, but he’s done a good job coming out of his shell and taking a leadership role.”
Now at the helm of the Crimson offense, Winters is developing his own leadership style.
“He’s a very unique leader,” Iannuzzi said. “Not only does he lead by example, but he does become vocal. He’s a good mixture of the silent leader doing what he’s supposed to be doing and a vocal one.”
“He knows when to be vocal, he just chooses his times very wisely,” he added.
While his teammates are quick to praise him, Winters diverts questions about his own performance, preferring to  talk about his teammates.
When asked about his play, he quickly credited his receivers and offensive line.
“My receivers did a really great job getting open and making plays,” he said. “[My] offensive line had by far the best game they’ve had. They did a great job of giving me time to throw and giving me lanes to throw to.”
But it was clear that Winters was excited about the win.
“We just wanted to come in and do whatever it took to get a win,” he said. “It’s a pretty big rivalry for us...It relieves a lot of pressure to get the first win, especially against a good team like Brown.”
Despite his quiet disposition, he clearly enjoyed the pressure of the Friday night lights.
“Big atmosphere,” he said, “the biggest game I’ve played in my career. The fans did a great job making a lot of noise and excitement. We’re looking forward to continuing this streak and having a big stage for the Yale game.”
Certainly, not all games have the same atmosphere of the night game and Harvard-Yale. The remaining home games against Lafayette, Princeton, Dartmouth, and Penn will likely not draw the same crowds as Winters saw against Brown.
But Winters should be just as motivated for games without the same fanfare.
As much as the junior liked the spotlight on Friday, it’s what he’s done when he’s not the center of attention that have made him the player he is today.
It’s those countless film sessions and coaches’ meetings. It’s the way he began preparing for this fall long before the offense was his.
That’s why Iannuzzi was surprised to hear Collier Winters being called “the new quarterback.” Because he’s been there all along.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard co-ed sailing team appears to have finally found its stride, as the squad earned a pair of fifth-place finishes over the weekend, the Crimson’s best showings of its young fall campaign. While the women’s team took the weekend off from competition to sail an alumni event, the co-ed squad’s top sailors placed fifth at the Hood Trophy regatta hosted by Tufts University. Some less experienced team members also competed this past weekend and collected a fifth-place effort at the Central Series Three regatta at Boston University.
“We had some solid results this weekend,” junior Teddy Himler said. “While they could have been a bit better, it was a definite improvement over our last couple of weekends.”
HOOD TROPHY
Harvard’s top co-ed sailors made the short trip to Medford, Mass. to compete on Mystic Lake for the two-day Hood Trophy regatta. The local venue provided a challenging sailing setting, as the Crimson squad had to battle shifty wind conditions and gernally trying weather on its way to a fifth-place team finish.
“The nickname for Mystic Lake is Mystery Lake for its unexpected wind conditions,” Himler said. “Wind puffs come in from out of nowhere, which really makes the sailing difficult and the results unpredictable.”
The tough venue, however, did not seem to bother Himler much, as he and sophomore crew Alexandra Jumper led the Harvard effort at the regatta with a fourth-place finish out of 24 teams in the B division.
The duo finished in the top 10 in nine of its 10 races with four top-three efforts, including a victory in the third contest of the weekend.
“Teddy and I don’t normally sail together, so this weekend we were able to get acquainted to each other’s styles,” Jumper said. “We sailed smart and conservative races and were able to recognize our mistakes and learn from them.”
Himler also commented on the learning experience this weekend’s regatta provided.
“Tufts uses the Lark dinghy for its competitions,” Himler said. “This type of boat is a bit different, as it is a long boat that accelerates quickly. We were a bit disadvantaged in sailing these boats because we don’t practice on them.”
In the A division, junior captain skipper Alan Palmer and fellow third-year crew Grace Charles placed ninth. The pair collected four top-six finishes and finished in the top three in two contests.
Harvard totaled 164 points on the weekend—15 points back of its rival Yale for fourth place. Roger Williams took home the team title with a final tally of 112 points.
“Sailing in New England is an unparalleled experience,” Himler said. “We compete against the top competition in the country every weekend. The season is a real grind, but we put in a lot of time in order to perform well and achieve the best results possible.”
CENTRAL SERIES FOUR
Some of the Crimson’s less experienced co-ed sailors made an even shorter trek over to Boston University to compete in the Central Series Three regatta on the Charles River.
The Harvard co-ed team collected a fifth-place finish at the local two-day event, totaling 143 points on the weekend.
Junior Colin Santangelo skippered the A-division boat to a third-place finish out of 17 schools, aided by the efforts of freshman crew Sarah McCuskee. The duo finished in the top five in seven of its 12 races, with two victories in its final three contests.
Freshman skipper Ryan Byrne and crew Alma Lafler took home sixth place in the B division of racing, with a total of 76 points on the weekend.

With October being Vegetarian Awareness Month and World Vegetarian Day coming up on Thursday, Oct. 1, the lovely ladies in charge of the Harvard College Vegetarian Society have recently announced that the group will begin having monthly lunches in the Lowell House dining hall to encourage more people who are interested in vegetarianism or veganism to join a community of like-minded consumers.
Anello said that, although the Veg Society’s email list contains over 200 names, a far smaller number of students show up to regular club events. She and co-president, Jessica M. Luna ’10, hope to encourage members of the club and other interested students to participate in campus-wide and Boston-area events going on throughout the month.
Learn about upcoming veggie festivities after the jump.
The Harvard Coop will be hosting a book signing by members of PETA to promote the organization’s new Vegan College Cookbook (complete with free food samples!) on Oct. 6.
The Harvard Veg Society will also be organizing a vegan baking workshop at the end of the month.
But what’s got FlyBy most excited? The Boston Vegetarian Food Festival comes to town on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, boasting hundreds of vendors and free goodies for everyone who visits. Happy (meatless) eating!

Last year, the FML phenomenon led to a fit of nationwide schadenfreude. Now, Harvard has its own spin-off, Harvardfml.com, spearheaded by the Voice.
Most of the posts on the site, though, aren't quite deserving of the FML moniker. To be honest, we go to Harvard; our lives really aren’t that rough.
But some of the posts are actually quite funny, though maybe that’s because FlyBy isn’t getting too much sleep. FML.
A list of FlyBy’s favorites after the jump.
- ‘I’m a freshman. I thought I was taking the shuttle to the Quad. Turns out it was the Wellesley Quad. FML”
- “I just ran through the rain in the Yard, slipped, fell, ripped my pants, and got stuck under a bright yellow chair. FML.”
- “Today I went to UHS because I had a stomach ache. They told me I had a miscarriage. I’ve never even had sex. FML.”

It may seem like H1N1 “swine” flu is taking over Harvard, as hand sanitizers pop up outside every elevator and more and more students are missing from section on account of their fever. As of last Friday, 200 Harvard students have gone to Harvard University Health Services with cases of influenza-like illness since the beginning of the semester, according to UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59. Last week, there were about 50 new cases.
But compared to Cornell, Harvard’s illness rates are looking positively cheery. See how other colleges are faring after the jump.
Cornell reported 623 cases of probable H1N1 flu slightly over a week ago, and one Cornell student died from complications related to H1N1.
Brown and Yale have also reported more probable H1N1 cases than Harvard. Brown's health services reported 234 cases of influenza-like illness as of last Wednesday, and over 300 Yale community members have contracted the H1N1 virus as of last Thursday.
But Princeton has emerged relatively unscathed so far–only 80 total students have contracted influenza-like illness as of a week ago.
Dartmouth seems to be right on pace with Harvard. They just started school because of their quarter system, but they diagnosed 47 new cases of influenza-like illness last week, only three fewer than Harvard. And if swine flu has advanced to the backwoods of Hanover, New Hampshire, all we at FlyBy can do is cross our fingers and use Harvard’s hand sanitizers.

Most loyal viewers of NBC's "Heroes" are well aware that the show has spiraled downward into a convoluted mess over the past two seasons. Between the excess of characters, nonsensical and repetitive plotlines, and the fact that continuity has been completely shot to hell, FlyBy is seriously hoping for an upward turn. Perhaps the volume's title "Redemption" is self-referential, but after watching this week's episode, we aren't getting our hopes up.
Spoilers abound, so beware.
Claire internally debates whether or not to tell her friend about her power/Daddy is interfering but he only wants to protect! his ClaireBear. As always.
Last week Claire let herself fall out her bedroom window, proving that her hyper-achieving roommate actually committed suicide and was not pushed. However, her friend-slash-stalker Gretchen happened to witness her healing. Oops.
Claire spends the entire episode avoiding Gretchen, whining about how she wants to trust someone and stop hiding the truth, while battling overprotective Daddy Noah Bennett along the way.
The Good: Claire finally stands up for herself; Claire bitches about orgo; we see a shirtless guy reflected in the mirror of the coed bathroom.
The Bad: Claire's whining about wanting to be herself and stop lying is getting really annoying and redundant. We sympathize, but enough is enough.
The WTF?: Noah Bennett never gives in that easily. NEVER.
Matt Parkman is totally losing it and seeing visions of Sylar because he just feels SO SO GUILTY about putting him in Nathan Petrelli's body. Or is he?
Matt Parkman is out on the job as a cop trying to shake down some drug dealer. But that's not important. What's important is that while inside this guy's house, Sylar shows up and starts totally screwing with Parkman's mind, in some cases saving his ass and in others making him see things that aren't there. But since, of course, the department doesn't know he's a telepath, Parkman has been telling everyone he's trying to kick the habit of "using."
The Good: Sylar and Matt's hilarious rapport; Sylar telling Matt that the dealer was in the closet and had a gun--and being correct; Matt finally using his powers again.
The Bad: Can't Sylar do something on his own, already?
The WTF?: Wait, we thought Sylar was just evidence that Matt was losing it. Is he real now? Is he just a figment of Matt's imagination? We're seriously confused.
Peter Petrelli gets sued but not really because it's the Samuel the carnival-ink guy trying to find him and use him to replace his brother, and oh wait, he also meets this new deaf girl who can hear colors. WTF?
So. There's this new guy, Samuel, whom we met last week, who can control ink, but his actual described power is to control the earth. He wants to find someone to replace his dead brother within his entourage at the carnival. So he goes after Peter Petrelli by pretending to be someone he previously saved and suing him for injuries. They bond. And simultaneously we are introduced to a new character Emma, who is deaf but can apparently see sound in the form of colors. At the end, Samuel collapses a big fancy house into a sinkhole.
The WTF?: This entire storyline. Maybe we weren't paying close enough attention, but we still don't totally understand what the deal is with Samuel.
OVERALL RATING THIS WEEK: B-
Most badass hero: Sylar. Hands down.
Most useless hero: Emma. Seeing sound as colors is kind of a cool effect, but we wish she could have done something interesting with it this week.
Character whom we wish had been killed off a while ago: Claire. Notice how she NEVER asks Gretchen about herself? That's because it's ALWAYS about Claire and how important she is and how hard it is to be her, blah blah blah. Unfortunately, given the rapid cellular regeneration thing, we're guessing we're stuck with her. Forever.

The art of sexile: It's perhaps the most sacred of all college maxims, the unspoken code of conduct that keeps lusty teenagers and cramped dorm rooms at peace.
Yet, students at our favorite Medford safety school seem to have had some trouble accepting and adhering to this age-old social decree—prompting administrators to lay down some intimacy rules:
A new addition to the Tufts student guest policy states:
Furthermore:
It's hard to imagine how this will be enforced, although the handbook says that "actions will be properly documented and subject to residential judicial consequences. Any flagrant violation [...] will result in immediate loss of guest privileges for a specified time period."
See how they're justifying the policy after the jump.
According to The Tufts Daily, the new policy was triggered by a "significant number of complaints last year from residents bothered by their roommates' social behavior," and the Tufts Office of Residential Life and Learning's assistant director told the newspaper that the incidents "happened more often than we'd like." But the Office emphasized that the new policy was aimed more at "facilitat[ing] conversation and compromise between roommates" than hindering "personal or private activity."
Seriously? Has there really been such a broach of civility to necessitate formal, explicit intervention? Cue student backlash:
"I don't believe it's the university's place to determine what goes on in a room," Freshman Jon Levinson told the Associated Press. "Personally, I wouldn't want to have sex in front of my roommate, and my roommate wouldn't want to have sex in front of me."
FlyBy sure hopes so—as much as Tufts bores us, we'd rather not learn that it's secretly become a breeding ground for voyeurism.

How could an episode of House called “Epic Fail” not be worth watching?! Unless of course it turned out to describe the plot...but FlyBy thinks not.
Recap and ratings after the jump. Yes, there are spoilers.
For the first couple of minutes, FlyBy was a little anxious: we weren’t really sure why there was a video game demo in place of a medical drama involving a misanthropic doctor who just got out of rehab. But don’t worry! All’s well!
Well, not really, because one of the designers of the video game has a few problems. He feels that his hands are burning; his lungs fill up with fluids; and oh, he also has a painful (we were not surprised) erection for three hours (?!). Gregory House has seen worse. But he’s too busy finding new hobbies, cooking meatballs, and making juvenile jokes about male genitalia with Wilson.
Wilson: Oh! Ow. No, no. They're browning way too fast.
House: Blue is the color you've got to watch out for.
*snicker snicker*
We thought that was funny. A little. Come on. You know you did, too.
House also quits his job. And the moment House leaves the room, Foreman (shocker) asks Cuddy to let him run the department. Cuddy asks him to take this case to see if he can handle the pressure. At that point, FlyBy was seething. But we also knew where the title of the episode came from.
WHAT AN EPIC FAIL.
Foreman makes several poor decisions when the patient posts his symptoms online and offers a $25,000 reward to anyone who can correctly diagnose him. Finally, the team diagnoses him with amyloidosis. Foreman has a dejected conversation with Thirteen about whether he’s ready for the responsibilities of the promotion when Thirteen tries to cheer him up by detailing her bisexual exploits. Wait, WTF?!
And just when you think everything is fine and dandy, the patient goes crazy and hallucinates again. Clearly, they were wrong. Foreman asks her to start him on chemotherapy. Later, he has a brainwave and runs up to Thirteen to tell her to stop. But she already has figured it out (correctly this time), after reading the online diagnoses.
Even though he told her not to. Uh-oh.
Later, he tells her that he finds it too hard to manage both the relationship and his promotion. Is he going to break up with her? No. He’s going to fire her. UH-OH.
In the meanwhile, Taub resigns because House isn’t around. UH-OH.
While shit goes down in Princeton-Plainsboro, House is sitting back and having a conversation with his therapist with--voila!--a check for $25,000 made by correctly diagnosing his old team’s patient. Medical diagnosis seems to be the only reliever of House’s pain.
In conclusion:
House is BACK. But he’s not the same. He’s not the same narcissist he used to be. No scathing comments. In fact, FlyBy doesn’t know whether we like him as much as we used to.
On a scale of 1-10:
The diagnosis: 6 (FlyBy doesn’t really like Foreman right now)
Sub-plots: 9 (Thirteen?! Taub?!)
House: 9 (“Et tu, bootay?”)
Overall: 8
Epic Fail? Nope.
