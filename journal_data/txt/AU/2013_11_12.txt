AU’s chapter of Habitat for Humanity will live on food stamps as part of the SNAP Challenge between Nov. 11 and 15. 
Users of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is responsible for giving out food stamps, are given $4.50 a day to spend on food, according to AU’s Habitat for Humanity vice president Jessica Agostinelli, a junior in the School of International Service. 
SNAP benefits are given to people who fall at or below the poverty line. About 49 percent of SNAP benefits go to children 18 or younger, according to SNAP’s website. As of August 2011, 45.8 million people in the U.S. were using SNAP benefits, according to the website. 
SNAP benefits can be used to buy all food items, vitamins and medicine. SNAP does not include alcohol or tobacco products, according to the SNAP website. 
Agostinelli said she hopes this week will be an opportunity to draw attention to this issue. 
“It really relates to issues of homelessness and poverty throughout D.C.,” Agostinelli said. 
AU Democrats, The Homelessness Coalition and American Youth and Government are also participating in the challenge. All of the different groups will be tabling throughout the week to bring visibility to the cause, Agostinelli said.
The group decided to participate in the challenge after 26 members of Congress conducted a similar challenge in June after changes to the Farm Bill threatened to cut SNAP’s budget by over $20 billion in the next decade, according to an article in the Huffington Post published in June. 
Habitat for Humanity has worked to encourage more participation by publicizing the challenge on Facebook and sending out email blasts. 
“We would love for as many people as possible to participate,” Agostinelli said.
As far as the food they will eat, Agostinelli said she plans on eating a lot of granola bars. Sarah Washburn, a junior in the School of Public Affairs and secretary for AU’s chapter of Habitat for Humanity, said she will also keep her meals simple, eating mostly rice, beans and peanut butter sandwiches to emulate the type of meals a SNAP participant would eat. Typically the people on SNAP work multiple jobs and do not have time or energy to be creative with meals, Washburn said. 
“Most people can identify with this,” Agostinelli said. “Food scarcity is an issue for the country as a whole.”

Women’s Initiative will hold auditions for the Vagina Monologues, an annual show spotlighting women’s experiences, on Nov. 12.
The show is part of the national V-Day campaign, which raises awareness of women’s issues around the world. The campaign collects monologues from women of many demographics with topics ranging from lighthearted and quirky to heavy and dramatic.
Women’s Initiative Co-Director of Performance and Speaking Initiatives Starr Brainard, a senior in College of Arts and Sciences, will be this year’s show director, organizing the event logistics and guiding the creative process. She will consult with other members of the club during the audition process, but the final casting decisions rest on her shoulders.
Students interested in auditioning do not need to bring anything or prepare.
“Bring yourself and don’t be afraid to be ridiculous and just let it all out there,” Brainard said. “We’re all understanding, we know they have only 15 minutes to prepare.”
Theater experience is welcome but not required. Brainard expects many of the students will be making their stage debuts. 
“They just need to exude whatever the flavor of the monologue is,” she said. “We aren’t expecting anyone super experienced.”
Cameron Schuette, a sophomore in School of Public Affairs, heard about the show last year and is excited to audition this week. She’s going to do her best when she’s auditioning and not think too much about it beforehand.
“I think Vagina Monologues is an important event for women on our campus, and I would love to be a part of it,” she said. “I plan on just giving it my all when I am there.”
Schuette and her fellow auditioners will interpret and perform a monologue that will not be included in the February show. Brainard expects a cast of approximately 30 students, including crew members.
Regular rehearsals, two per week, will begin next semester after an initial cast meeting in December. 
Audiences should expect storytelling and specificity in the show on Feb. 6-8. The V-Day Initiative has not finalized the show’s structure yet, according to Brainard, but it will be a mix of single-person and group scenes linked by the common theme of women’s experiences with their vaginas.
Auditions for “The Vagina Monologues” will be held Nov. 12 from 5:45-9 p.m. in Letts Lower Level Conference Room, Nov. 14 from 8-11 p.m. in MGC 244 and Nov. 16 from 11 a.m.-2 p.m. in in Leonard Classroom 121.

Megan Gebbia looks to lead the Eagles to a Patriot League title after becoming the women’s basketball head coach in August
If there is one certainty about new women’s basketball head coach Megan Gebbia, it is her experience winning.
“It’s a business. We’re trying to win games and it’s about whatever it takes to do that,” she said.
AU’s Director of Athletics and Recreation Billy Walker announced that Megan Gebbia would be AU’s new women’s basketball head coach on Aug. 12. Gebbia replaces former head coach Matt Corkery who became the associate head coach at Texas Tech University.
While serving as an assistant women’s basketball coach at Marist College for the past 10 years, Gebbia has been a vital part of nine MAAC Championships and a Sweet Sixteen NCAA Tournament appearance. Most importantly, Gebbia learned the ins and outs of running a collegiate basketball team from Marist head coach Brian Giorgis .
“Coach Giorgis has had a tremendous influence on my coaching career,” Gebbia said. “He is a good Christian guy, and he does things the right way. He wins the right way.”  
In addition to enthusiasm and winning experience, Gebbia brings a new system to AU that is similar to the one she helped run at Marist College.
“It’s more of a motion offense involving various screens where players have to read the defender and make calls based on how they are being played against,” she said. “Our defense is now playing a sort of saggy man defense; our job is to keep the ball out of the paint, force difficult perimeter shots and they[the opponent] better have a good shooting night to beat us.”
So far the players have been quite enthusiastic about the new system.
“Everyone is buying into the system,” senior guard Alexis Dobbs said. “I’m excited to see what we can do this season for my last year.”
To help the players in their transition to the new system, coach Gebbia brought in coaches who had experience and understood the system including assistant coaches Nikki Flores and Emily Stallings from Marist College and assistant coach Tiffany Coll. Coll has nearly ten years of collegiate coaching experience and was a part of three 20  win seasons at Lehigh, before coming to AU.
“The leadership that came in was really inspiring for all of us,” sophomore forward Abigail Fogg said. “Having people who have been to the tournament before coach us, that’s really important.”
Their adjustment to the system, however, has had its ups and downs.
“What we struggle with mostly right now, is being disciplined on defense. We’re still not where we should be in rebounding and defending in the paint,” Gebbia said. 
Despite their flaws in practice, Gebbia is confident that her team will gain better understanding and confidence of her system as the season progresses.
“It’s just a matter of putting that system in place and having them run that system day in and day out so that when the end of the season comes and the tournament comes they will be ready,” Gebbia said.
In their first two exhibition games, the AU women’s basketball team showed tremendous offensive firepower, scoring 76 and 77 points, respectively. Dobbs will be a key asset for the Eagles’ success this season due to her scoring abilities. In their recent preseason game against Messiah College, she tallied 16 points, seven rebounds and two assists.
“Alexis is the head to the body on our team. As she goes, we go,” Gebbia said.
Once the Eagles learn to execute Gebbia’s style of defense and continue to improve in the team’s new “read and react” offense, AU will be a force to be reckoned with.
“We are talented enough to compete for the championship,” Gebbia said. “If the team could give up every individual award they have to win a championship that would mean everything to them.”
Flores acknowledges that if one coach can bring the Eagles a championship, it is Gebbia.
“Gebbia is one of the best coaches that I’ve ever been around as far as teaching and making sure you understand what’s going on,” Flores said. 
AU’s first game of the season will be on Nov. 12 at home in Bender Arena against University of Maryland Eastern Shore.

The AU Student Health Center will have a new director in time for the spring semester.
Dr. David Reitman, a physician at George Washington University’s Student Health Service, will begin work at the health center on Dec. 1, according to Dean of Students Robert Hradsky. 
Reitman’s hiring comes after the former director and five other employees left AU during the summer.
While at GWU, Reitman specialized in LGBT health and has “written and lectured frequently” on LGBT health issues, according to the Student Health Service website.
In addition to working part-time at GWU, Reitman is also the director of the Pediatric Emergency Center at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, and has a private practice where he specializes in adolescent medicine, according to Hradsky.
“He is very collaborative in his approach,” Hradsky said. “[Reitman] has done a number of things to promote health and well-being at GWU.”
Reitman, who graduated from the Tufts University School of Medicine in 1997, said he plans to work with student organizations at AU and wants to hear from students about issues that concern them.
“Interaction doesn’t end when the patient leaves the door,” Reitman said.

General site 1 of Geva’s paintings in Katzen Museum.
Israeli artist Tsibi Geva discussed his artworks hanging in the Katzen Arts Center with art critic Barry Schwabsky of The Nation and museum curator Jack Rasmussen in front of an eager audience Nov. 9. 
Geva kicked off his talk by explaining the importance of the process. He accomplishes this by creating multiple strokes of black and white with a layering effect to create a narrative or event for the viewer , which makes pieces come to life.. These black and white streaks and the subtle vibrancy of intense colors represent the influence of conflict and dialogue in his experiences and in Israeli life, Geva said.
When asked about the difficulty of being perceived as an artist in an age that is heavily video-and-media oriented, Geva replied rather optimistically. 
“The new abstract is hard to understand…but give it time and that will change,” he said. 
Geva is an internationally recognized artist with exhibitions in Tel Aviv, Berlin, Italy and New York. His awards include the Aptowitzer Prize, which promotes Israeli advancement in the arts, and the Mendel and Eva Pundik Prize for Israeli Art. 
Arguably his most powerful response was when someone in the audience asked him to pick a painting and explain what it meant to him. Geva seemed discomforted by the question, but was forced to give an answer that left the audience silent and with goose bumps. 
“The story writes me, it’s not me that writes the story,” he said.
He further explained that most artists are able to talk about their problems because painting those particular experiences has helped them do so. However, Geva’s process is the complete opposite. He admits that he paints before he can talk about his struggles, and even after, he doesn’t know how to talk about it. 
Geva stressed the importance of a viewer to be able to perceive a certain energy from paintings without knowing anything about the painting or the artist himself. 
“For me, the painting on the wall has to talk,” he said. 
Tsibi Geva’s work is currently on display at the Katzen Arts center from Nov. 5 to Dec. 15 along with five other exhibits ranging from sculpture to photography.
