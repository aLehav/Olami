Activist and founder of Unchained at Last Fraidy Reiss, spoke to American University students Tuesday at a webinar virtual event hosted by AU Student Government’s Women’s Initiative.
The webinar was moderated by Skylar White, a junior in the School of International Studies, and featured an introduction given by Kaniya Harris, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs.
Unchained at Last is a nonprofit organization that works to end forced and child marriage in the United States. Unchained provides legal assistance and social services while advocating for ending child marriage at both the state and federal level.
Between 2000 to 2018, almost 300,000 minors were married in the United States.
“In most of these cases, because these individuals were under the age of 18, they were entered into a marriage by a parent … in many cases without any input from them, and in most cases, they were not allowed to file for divorce … because they are minors,” Reiss said.
Reiss differentiated between a forced marriage and a child marriage. While a forced marriage can occur at any age, child marriage is defined as having one or both parties under the age of 18.
During the webinar, Reiss spoke about her own experience with forced marriage.
“I was married off to a stranger when I was 19,” Reiss said. “I was not allowed to have a bank account. Not allowed to have any money of my own, to have a job, not enough not to have my own credit card … So what does that mean? Once I realized this guy is violent and abusive and is threatening to kill me, and I want to leave, how can I possibly support myself?”
After leaving her husband, Reiss said she was completely cut off from her family and religious community.
“It took me 15 years to get out of that abusive marriage, at which time my family retaliated, they shunned me,” she said. “And after I managed to rebuild my life with my two daughters, I founded Unchained at Last to help others who were … going through what I was.”
Unchained at Last travels to different states to educate lawmakers on the need to raise the minimum age to get married, Reiss said.
“This is, we like to say, the most simple common sense legislation that harms no one,” Reiss said. “It costs nothing. The price tag is $0.00, and that's including tax. And it's legislation that ends human rights abuse. How often do you have legislation like that, that harms no one, costs nothing and brings such incredible benefit?”
Reiss described how, during these visits, members of Unchained at Last dress in bridal gowns, chain their wrists and tape their mouths to show legislatures “what life looks like for a girl or a woman who was forced to marry.”
The current minimum age for marriage in D.C. is 18, or 16 with the consent of a parent or guardian.
Unchained at Last has been able to introduce legislation in half of the U.S., and pass legislation that raises the minimum marriage age in six states.
“That's how hard it is to pass the simple common sense legislation,” Reiss said.

Kennedy Political Union and Women’s Initiative invited former Black Panther Party member Fredrika Newton to speak about her experiences participating in the Black liberation movement of the 1960s on Monday. 
Newton is a retired nurse but was raised by activist parents in Oakland, California at a time of mass violence and racial turmoil. 
“It was super racist where we were living,” Newton said. “There were still Klan meetings on Tuesday nights in town, so we were afraid to even go off campus,” referring to her time at the University of Oregon. “There were only 35 Black students on campus at that time. My grades [had] plummeted.”
Newton was married to Black Panther Party of Self Defense founder Huey Newton until he was murdered in August 1989. 
Huey and Bobby Seale established BPP in 1966 to fight against police brutality and racial inequality in their home city of Oakland. Police brutality and the fight for civil rights for Black Americans had risen to a level that made Huey and Seale decide they needed to fight back in the name of justice for their community.
Newton was 19 years old when she met Huey at her mother’s house.
“My mother told me that the Black Panther members of the Black Panther Party were coming over for lunch and I was a little taken aback. I just didn't want to be there. I spent a lot of time actually avoiding the Black Panther Party,” Newton said. 
Despite trying to avoid the Black Panther Party, Newton quickly got involved with Huey.
“I started seeing Huey, but I didn't join the party right away. In fact, I don't think Huey even really wanted me to join the party. It was so dangerous during that time,” she said. “We were under constant surveillance, or the party was under constant surveillance, and harassment by the FBI. They were breaking into offices, shooting up members. By that time, over 20 of our members had been killed.”
The BPP was targeted by local and state law enforcement due to their armed stance against the police as well as being surveilled by the FBI through its COINTELPRO program. 
“It was hard work serving the community, body and soul. We rarely slept, we lived communally. It wasn't an easy life. There was no work life balance. It was work. In the mornings, we were up at five in the morning and fed the children and then we would go out during the day and do whatever our assignment was and you had to make sure that the place where you were living was secured,” Newton said. 
Newton explained that BPP members took turns standing “watch” every day so that there was always somebody awake to look out for threats against the organization.
“But you know, I was my mother's daughter,” she said. “I was an activist, mother's activist daughter and this is how I became a member of the Black Panther Party.”
As a member of the BPP, Huey created the Ten Point Platform and Program which illustrated the goals the Party hoped to achieve. These survival programs included the Black Panther Party newspaper, a free ambulance service and a free breakfast program for students, all of which Newton heavily participated in. 
When Huey was shot and killed in August 1989, Newton said she remembers feeling lost. 
“It took me a long, long time to unpack that grief. But I realized that with that grief came a legacy and that it wasn't just in my heart and in my head. It was physical and in my basement,” she said. “There were photos, there were archives, there were writings, books, poetry, recordings, artwork, there was something.”
Newton realized that, while there were so many remnants of Huey’s lifelong activism, “there was so little in the public awareness about the party that was accurate or representative for a Black power movement that fed, clothed, educated, protected and cared for its Black and poor citizens.”
“This is American history,” she said. “That's an American story and this is American history that needs to be told and understood for what it was.”
Now, over thirty years after his death, Newton is still honoring her husband and the work he did. President of the Dr. Huey P. Newton Foundation, founded in 1995, her mission has been to promote the accurate history of the BPP with the archives Huey Newton left behind. Newton has worked with the Oakland City government to install a bust of Huey and name the street where he was murdered after him as a way to publicly acknowledge and commemorate the work of the BPP. 
Even though she is working to commemorate the past work of the Black Panthers, Newton still sees the mark of the BPP come alive in places like the Black Lives Matter movement. 
“The activism that rose up in this country in 2020 has the footprint of the Black Panther Party all over it,” Newton said. “The government focused on the activists instead of the perpetrators of these hate crimes, which also has a footprint in the Black Panther Party. And as the focus shifted toward the very unradical idea that Black lives do indeed matter.”

Correction: Newton went to the University of Oregon, not UC Berkeley.

The American University women’s basketball team grabbed their fourth straight victory Wednesday night inside Bender Arena, defeating the Lafayette Leopards 62-48.
With Wednesday’s victory, the Eagles clinched the second seed in the Patriot League tournament.
“We’re obviously really excited,” senior Jade Edwards said postgame. “As seniors, you just look forward to the games that are gonna decide the season.”
The Eagles were led by Edwards’ double-double scoring 13 points and recording 10 rebounds along with sophomore Emily Johns’ 19 points and two rebound outings.
AU couldn’t find consistent rhythm shooting the ball through the first five minutes of the contest. The Eagles shot 3-8 from the field and 0-3 from distance only collecting six points off Edwards and senior Emily Fisher.
The slow shooting start along with seven unanswered Leopard points led to head coach Megan Gebbia calling AU’s first timeout of the game after being down 7-6 after five minutes of play. 
Coming out of the timeout, Gebbia subbed out senior Laura Graytok and turned to Johns to step up and play important minutes. Edwards connected on back-to-back layups followed by a Fisher jumper to put AU up 12-11. 
AU slowly began to find their rhythm with some gritty hustle plays after shooting 38 percent from the field with 12 points after the first 10 minutes.
Coming out of the quarter timeout, Johns got back-to-back layups to go after starting the game 0-2 from the field. Fisher then extended the lead up to 19-11 after draining a pull-up three from well beyond the arc.

After a jumper from Leopards freshman Kylie Favours, Edwards converted on her first three of the game to push the lead to nine for the Eagles. Junior Karla Vreš made her first basket of the game to take a 24-13 lead with 3:39 left in the half. 
Senior Maddie Doring then went on to hit a tough three-pointer for her first points of the game with under two minutes left in the half. AU would eventually lead 27-15 heading into halftime.

AU finished the half behind Edwards’ nine points on 66 percent shooting and Fisher’s nine points and two assists. As a team, AU shot 39.2 percent from the field and 33 percent from distance.
Immediately coming out of halftime, Lafayette freshman Abby Antognoli made her first three of the second half to cut the AU lead to 27-18. 
After Lafayette senior Makaila Wilson made a layup to narrow the Eagle lead to seven, senior Naomi Ganpo scored on back-to-back layups to put Lafayette down 27-25 heading into the first Eagle timeout of the half with 7:19 remaining in the quarter.
“We had a lull in the third quarter defensively with transition and second-chance opportunities,” Gebbia said postgame. “We showed a lot of maturity when they cut it to two, and we found a way to get the ball inside to [Johns] to give us some breathing room.”
Following the timeout, the Eagles scored 5 straight points in under a minute off a Johns layup and Fisher 3-pointer to take a 32-27 lead over the Leopards. Lafayette stopped the run with a Wilson made layup, but Johns got hot shortly after. Johns sank her fourth layup of the night to put the Eagles up 34-29, leading to another Leopard timeout with 4:40 left in the quarter.
Both teams struggled after the Leopards timeout, turning the ball over consecutively until Johns got fouled and made a free throw to push AU’s lead to 35-29.
The AU home crowd was tense after Lafayette junior Jessica Booth converted on a layup, but got electric when Johns was fouled and hit both free throws for her 11th point of the game. 
“I had to smile because this kid is on fire today, and I’m so happy for her,” Gebbia said of Johns’ performance. 
After Johns made both attempts from the line, Antognoli made a jumper to narrow AU’s lead to six. Sophomore Ivy Bales came back shortly after to hit a jumper, putting the Eagles up 41-33 with 2:11 remaining in the quarter.
The Leopards stayed persistent though, making back-to-back jumpers from freshman Claire Gallagher and Antognoli to bring the score to 44-38 at the end of the quarter. Vreš helped the Eagles back to an eight-point lead after making a layup, followed by a Doring layup of her own to put the Eagles up 10, 48-38.
Another AU run was inevitable after Johns made another layup in the paint. However, with AU settling for 3-pointers, Lafayette went on a 6-0 run, but AU still had the lead intact, 50-46. 
After a Lafayette turnover, Doring made a layup which led to a momentum swing that ended up going the Eagles way. The AU defense forced multiple shot clock violations and went on a 10-0 run to close the game following another Lafayette layup. 
Edwards’ 13 points and 10 rebounds led the Eagles, her second double-double of the season. Johns also had a huge game, scoring 19 points and grabbing two rebounds.
Next up
The American University Eagles look to extend their season this Monday inside Bender Arena in the Patriot League Quarterfinals at 7 p.m. EST.

World Series champion Ryan Zimmerman announced his retirement on Feb. 15 after 16 years with the Nationals. As a result of spending his entire career in D.C., Zimmerman is one of the faces of D.C. sports. 
During the 2019 World Series, Zimmerman hit .208, including 5 home runs. Zimmerman played a critical role in the Nationals’ World Series win. Zimmerman hit the first World Series home run in Nationals’ history. The home run was hit off of four-time all-star Gerrit Cole’s 97mph fastball, making Zimmerman’s run a monumental moment in the National’s franchise. 
The Nationals drafted Zimmerman as their first pick during the 2005 draft. As a two-time all-star, two-time silver slugger, a golden glove recipient and a career batting average of .277, Zimmerman had 16 monumental years with the Nationals.
Zimmerman made an official statement via Twitter announcing his retirement. 
Today, Ryan Zimmerman announces his retirement from the game of baseball. Thank you Ryan for all that you have done both on and off the field!⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣A message from Employee No. 11 ...⁣⁣ pic.twitter.com/BOwfsjS4Yo
“Ryan's numbers and accomplishments speak for themselves, but the way he led by example and was respected not only in our clubhouse but around the game,” Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said in a statement. “That is what I will remember most about his career.” 
Off the field, Zimmerman founded the ziMS Foundation, which is dedicated to the treatment and ultimate cure of Multiple Sclerosis, a disease that affects the central nervous system. Zimmerman’s mother was diagnosed with MS in 1995.
“My family has given me the support to fulfill my dreams. The Washington Nationals have given me the opportunity to play the game that I love at the highest level in our nation’s capital,” Zimmerman said on his website. “I am thrilled to have launched a foundation that I hope can make a real impact in the life of my family as well as many others afflicted by MS.” 
Since its founding, the ziMS Foundation has raised more than $3,500,000. 
After 16 years in D.C., Zimmerman’s legacy will live on through the ziMS Foundation and, of course, the 2019 World Series.

Who would have ever thought that the transition from a classic rom-com to a suspenseful horror movie could be so seamless? 
“Fresh,” released at Sundance earlier this year, is the feature directorial debut of Mimi Cave. This is also the first big picture for star Daisy Edgar-Jones as Noa, a young woman navigating her way through the horrors of modern dating.
Noa has grown tired of the dating scene. From the endless swiping on a Tinder-like app to awkward first dates, she wonders if the hassle is worth it; that is, until she bumps into Steve (Sebastian Stan). He’s the perfect guy: handsome, witty and a surgeon. After just one date, Steve invites Noa on a weekend trip, which she readily agrees to at the behest of her best friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs). Before leaving on their romantic escape, Noa spends the night at Steve’s house, where he drugs her, chains her in a room and reveals his big secret — Steve is a cannibal who sells women’s “meat” on the black market. Now it’s up to Noa to outmaneuver Steve and somehow escape, all while Mollie desperately searches for her lost friend.
Casual viewers could easily mistake “Fresh” for a typical rom-com at first glance. There’s the coincidental meet-up, the saccharine dialogue, the palpable chemistry — the film checks all the genre’s boxes. However, once the opening credits roll onto the screen about half an hour in, Cave pulls the rug out from under our feet and the horror is revealed. That being said, once terror enters the movie, there isn’t a complete tonal switch. The film keeps some of the lighter comedic elements from its rom-com leanings and combines these with the horror in an extremely fascinating mix, all while keeping viewers at the edge of their seats the entire time.
One of the main standouts of the movie is Cave’s excellent direction. Her camera is dynamic, many times swooping around the scenes. Instead of static shots of characters talking in a booth, the camera will spin around them as the background changes from setting to setting. Cave uses a vibrant, stylized approach to the lighting and colors in the film. The movie is filled with bright hues and deep shadows, providing plenty of lively contrast. For a first-time director, Cave approaches the film with a surprising amount of nuance and technique.
The film is also full of standout performances. Edgar-Jones is excellent in her role: defiant and fighting to survive, all while avoiding getting overwhelmed by her opposite, played by Stan. But in the end, the character of Steve steals the show. He’s a Patrick Bateman-esque character, and Stan is perfect in the role. He oozes charisma and charm, but becomes terrifying in the blink of an eye. In the hands of a lesser actor, some of the things Steve does in the movie could verge on the side of silly, but Stan pulls it off in darkly comedic fashion.
While it remains a thrilling story filled with twists and turns throughout, “Fresh” has something to say about being a woman in the world of modern dating. The movie pokes fun at the hook-up culture, dating apps and the awkwardness that comes with first dates. 
Early in the film, one of Noa’s dates remarks that women used to dress with more femininity and suggests that she would look prettier in a dress. Cave uses this opportunity to comment on the male gaze and ideas men have about women being traditionally feminine, even when they don’t want to be. Later Noa talks about how “it’s all her fault” she was kidnapped, a not-so-hidden metaphor for victim blaming. Cave comments on this, speaking through another character in the film who says “it’s always their fault.”
Some may be quick to draw comparisons between “Fresh” and movies such as “Get Out” and “Promising Young Woman” with like-minded themes of dating and mistrust. Nevertheless, though “Fresh” may veer into stale territory at times, it does enough to distinguish itself from the pack, with the help of plenty of style and great performances.
“Fresh” was released on Hulu on March 4.
