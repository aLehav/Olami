AU students campaigned for the continuation of same-sex marriage in Washington state. 
Washington residents voted in favor of a referendum approving the legislation passed earlier this year that allowed same-sex couples to marry in Tuesday’s election.
Students ran a phone-bank to remind Washington voters to mail in their ballots and spoke with residents about this referendum, known as Referendum 74, according to School of Public Affairs senior Stephen Bronskill, who is a Seattle resident. 
All of Washington’s residents vote by mail-in ballots. 
Student callers clarified to Washington residents that voting “yes” approved the legislation, Bronskill said. They made about 2,970 calls to Washington voters, he said.
Students focused on calling youth voters between the ages of 18 and 29, according to SPA junior Tyler Sadonis, who interned at the Seattle-based Washington Bus, a nonprofit that advocates for political participation by youth voters. 
There is low voter turnout from the youth populations because this demographic is not usually contacted during campaigns, Bronskill said.
Phone banking can be the little reminder that gets people out to vote, and same-sex marriage is an issue young people can support, Bronskill said
Similar same-sex marriage legislation also passed in Maryland and Maine, and Minnesota voted down a referendum that would have banned same-sex marriage. 
“It is cool to be in the most politically active school,” Bronskill said. “We are really excited that we are in a position to make a difference.”

• Good things come to those who wait.
• Tell your boyfriend who wants a sexually open relationship to go f*** himself.  If he loves you, and if the two of you want to start a family together, then he needs to be in a place where he can support you unconditionally.  End of story.  It sounds like he's more concerned with himself than he is with you, and that's a sign that you should kick him to the curb.  I promise that you can find a better guy out there who would love you more than he does.
• As a guy, I can tell you that there are A LOT of us who would never dream of cheating, or even want an open relationship if our partners were okay with it.  Your boyfriend sounds like a major douche, and that's not something I would normally say to someone.
• @netflix you tool: clearly you can't read. My original rant was asking for an alternative to Netflix. The person who responded recommended imdb. Then i thanked him. Try and keep up.
• @Tried to ask a girl out last night and couldn’t work up the courage….urghh maybe I’m not ready :( What is the first letter of her name? 
• ADBLOCK SUGGESTER, I LOVE YOU 
• To EVERYONE complaining about CAUS. I get why your mad but yo there where flyers everywhere. And don't act like you were sleeping. It happened so get over it
• There's a chance we could make it now; we'll be rocking til the sun goes down
• @"I can't wait to meet you"- me either ;)
• Girl desperate for her bf to propose: what he is doing is extremely manipulative, and it sounds like you're in a relationship that's hurting you more than it's helping you. As hard as this sounds, you need to break it off. There IS someone out there who will treat you better and want monogamy. You deserve so, so much better. Good luck!
• "Turn out the light Don't try to save me Well you may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right"
• meh meh meh meh meh
• You ask the most annoying/interesting questions in class everyday. I can't make up my mind whether I hate you or not. 
• There is no such thing as bad publicity.  Way to go CAUS.
• To the cute guy with curly hair sitting in TDR with your friends on the cereal side...you're cute :)
• Liking to be dominated is not super kinky.  It's more like french vanilla.
• Wow @ all the people complaining about the CAUS making noise. I was in the library at the time and it was really not all that disturbing and 11:15 isn't exactly the dead of night. I didn't take part in this thing since I didn't know about it, but it's so lame that the rich kids here would rather pay thousands of dollars more in tuition than make some effort to fight this if it means making some noise (or disturbing poor Kerwin's sleep, as if his tuition hikes aren't going to screw us all over in our personal lives way more).
• The hot tub's too hot.
• @RE:@super bummed: I am talking about you, E.J. with two E's! When do you want meet? How's Monday ~11:45 at the dav? I'll be inside!
• Anyone saying the CAUS protest was too disruptive has clearly never heard of protesting. 
• To the people that complain about eagle rants...if you don't like them, don't read them.
• I'd love to know what "student body" the CAUS claims to represent when they do nothing but bash every single student who disagrees with them. Their facebook page includes comments like "f student government" (Newsflash: it's the group that's ACTUALLY elected to represent. Y'all just decided you're representative) and diatribes basically bashing every STUDENT group that doesn't worship at their unwashed feet. Get over yourselves and stop embarrassing this campus. 
• @"bf of 4 years said he would propose and we can get married if I agree to a sexually open marriage." Woah woah woah. No, men don't always cheat, he's just got no self-control. He's probably cheated on you already, get out of there.
• Yes. I really miss talking to her, that’s all!: Yeah, I'm trying. It's weird when they've moved on, but you haven't. It'll come though, in time. We got this :)
• @ "I actually really hope family values are destroyed.  Families are dumb."  Congratulations, I think you pretty much just summarized the DNC platform.  Sincerely, Liberals R. Tools. 
• @ "When I read Liberals R Tools’ posts, I imagine a tiny little man frothing at the mouth and rolling on the ground spewing nonsense."  That's funny - when I read liberals' posts, I imagine a dirty hippie with an attitude and a sense of entitlement.  Oh wait...that's reality.  Sincerely, Liberals R. Tools.
• Can we start talking again? I know you don't want to be anything more, you have your girl. Please, I miss you in my life and your hilarious personality. Answer my texts, even if they're late at night, just answer them in the morning or whenever. I miss being the friends we were like two weeks ago. I'll take the friendzone over this zone of nothingness.  
• sorry I'm not screwing up my life, but just because you are doesn't make you better than I am.
• Learned something today small talk=friend zoned, flirting=relationship (possibly)
• Today I learned it's not just guys that participate in No-Shave-November....didn't think I needed to know that
• @"grindr suicide":  Yeah, but maybe the people you blocked won't notice, or you can block them again, change your picture/headline so they don't notice, etc. Is the cutie worth it? ;)
• @"grindr's sketchy as anything." I completely understand everything you've said and I really really appreciate it. It's definitely sketchy, but I don't use it for random/weird hookups cause that's not my thing.  But anyway, it's nice to know there are other quality gay guys out there. Maybe we'll meet someday, and if not, I hope at least you find one of the great guys in our "boat."  Thanks again. -Gay Ranter
• @more organic student-set-up-dating service: I agree! forget the student government and hall councils, you're right! my bad :P
• @open relationship proposal: what. the. actual. f*ck. He's not being "honest," he's being stupid.  I don't care what you learned in whatever class, but "it still hurts" for a reason.  I'm a guy, and if I'm going to propose to someone, I'm going into it with the intent of " 'till death do us part."  Not " 'till I eventually cheat."  I know people do open marriages, but you don't sound too fond of it. There are PLENTY of guys out there who will want to marry you and be with you-and only you.
• I love my roommate, really, but she's such a hypocrite and completely intolerant. I respect her outrageous religious views she forces on everyone and I don't say a word when she constantly tries to up one everyone, but tonight when I was watching the Youtube video on Obama tearing up whilst thanking his staff, she storms in and goes "He's a lying thief". Im sorry, what? I never said a word to you! We just had a lovely evening. I've never been that blunt about things about her I don't like, but maybe I'll start to be
• does know who i is? does you listen to music? do you watch tv? DO YOU CARRY A LUNCHBOX?!
• Craig Ferguson is hilarious
• We need white voters; not just blacks and hispanics.  Saying its not a white election is racist and it only furers the discrimination that divides our nation. 
• don't stand so close to me
• Call me old-fashioned, but for me the purpose of marriage is for two people (regardless of gender identity) to proclaim to each other and their loved ones that they deeply love each other and they want to only be each other for the rest of their lives. The fact that he's saying "most men cheat anyways" tells me that a) he has no self control and b) he will end up cheating on you. 
• And I bet you any money that if you took advantage of the openness of this marriage, he would have a problem (no matter what he says now). You have to leave this guy. If after 4 years he still doesn't want to commit to you and only you, chances are he's not going to anytime soon. 
• Brace yourselves, the CAUS reply rants are coming...
• Yeah, Obama authorized drone strikes which killed civilians and children. It's a tragedy. But Romney would have done the same thing, and he would have taken our country back 50 years. So that's why we're celebrating. Should we be mourning the fact that some third party candidate who statistically had no chance of winning didn't win?
• Ward is full of gorgeous ladies right now. YAY
• Wooohooo a bunch more just came in. 
• wait, this must be a trap... ALL MEN GET OUT OF WARD IMMEDIATELY
• "I should just buy the United States" - Mitt Romney
• Eagle rants needs a trigger warning. Editors, consider that or perhaps limiting the obscenely offensive comments. (I mean, whatever happened with the whole hate speech? That isn't protected under any law, FYI)
• CAUS deserves all the hate it gets here on Eagle Rants. They are simply dogmatic, obnoxious, whiners who don't understand the mechanics of the real world. Every CAUS member I've talked to has never had to truly work for themselves and is more disrespectful of personal rights than anyone else I know.
• I think I'm getting sick for the third time this semester :(
• I really like this girl on my floor.  We went to lunch and I had a great time.  I really hope it works out this time.
• DO NOT MARRY HIM. He probably is already cheating and that's why wants an open relationship. You are young. You deserve someone who won't make you hurt. Kick his sorry a*s to the curb. 
• glad you're taking the hint and being more of a Lship biddie than a bear. 
• lol, CAUS has become the most hated entity on AU since Alex Knepper.
• You keep saying exploited... I do not think that word means what you think it means.
• Hey Everyone! I know what we should do! Since none of us have anything better to do and our lives are so meaningless that the only way for us to find joy is in *itching about EVERYTHING, irregardless of its relevance in our own lives, lets all act like a bunch of petulant children and bang on pots and pans in the middle of the night... oh wait, we already did that.  
• I sometimes, check that, ALWAYS wish I had never met you. You communist kids without a caus (haha see what I did there) are always looking for something to champion. It really is too bad that you don't see how most of the problems you want to "fix," you created in the first place. 
• When I talk to you, I like to think that Darwin would be disappointed. 
• I wish I was your second derivative so I could investigate your concavities. 
• Wanna expand my polynomial? 
• All that Communism needs to make it successful is someone to feed and clothe it.
• @Open marriage girl.  Yes you are wrong to agree to that.  Statistically the younger you get married, the more likely you are to get divorced.  Wait until you find someone who's ready to commit to YOU.
• Most people who read "The Communist Manifesto" probably have no idea that it was written by a couple of young men who had never worked a day in their lives, and who nevertheless spoke boldly in the name of "the workers". ~Thomas Sowell
-Sound like anyone else we know? (cough, cough, CAUS, cough)
• Can someone explain why someone yelled "sell your house" at Neil Kerwin in that Caus video? Really? Sell your house? What good would that do? Herp de derp, we want tuition to go down, herp de derp, sell your house! Just no.
• There are 5 people in my contemporary Africa class paying attention right now. I have no idea what the point of his lecture is as usual. WHAT AM I DOING HERE?
• @Iwould’vewhistled  Cut the patriarchy and check your privilege.
• @Sexism Erm, no.  That's called prejudice.  You can't be sexist against men because, definitionally, 'sexism' and 'racism', and all other 'isms' imply a societal stance against a particular group.  You can be PREJUDICED against men, but then there's not much you can do about it, as a woman.  Ergo THE DIFFERENCE.
• @Ican'tstopcutting  Talk to somebody.  Do you want me to give you my doctor's name?
• @"Let's go to all the CAUS members' doors in the middle of the night and yell and scream at that. See how that feels." Uh pretty sure they're not the ones making me go even further into debt next year and the year after to keep going to AU. Anyway I think the whole point is that it doesn't feel so good to be waken up by banging pots
• i hate having a roommate. it was fun for a while, but i just want to be ALONE. sheesh.
• @"so. sexually. frustrated": Me too :) Let's meet up and fix that, okay?
• If you're cutting yourself - make friends.
• And if you hit the table then the record might skip might skip.
I told.
Stop hittin the table.
• @OpenMarriageGirl
If you don't like the idea of it, that's never going to change. Don't marry this guy.
• That awkward moment when you realize that Mitt Romney is Christian Grey. 
• @ berskshire blondie: if I'm thinking of the same dude, don't let his gf scare you off. Dudes always down for a sidepiece
• lol @ the video of Kerwin admitting he's only accountable to the corporate execs that make up the board of trustees. not that it's any surprise, but still

The true showdown took place on the air
By Ethan McLeod
This past Tuesday, America waited patiently as its future was decided by the 2012 election between possibly two of the most nationally divisive candidates yet. Families sat in silence, campaign workers moved in frenzies to get voters to the polls and young people geared up to either celebrate or protest the outcome of the election. 
But many may have noticed that the true showdown took place on air. News outlets vied for America’s hearts by trying to produce the most sound commentary and the most accurate reflections of poll results. How did media outlets spearhead the coverage of the election and turn their own reports into worldwide news? There is no certain answer for that, but each network undoubtedly added its own flavor to their coverage of the historical night.
NBC took an aesthetically rooted approach. The network’s program, “NBC Nightly News,” featured numerous images of an electoral map set up on the Rockefeller Center Ice Rink, depicting the state-by-state electoral votes for each candidate. Viewers watched in awe as New York was turned into a “Democracy Plaza” on the show hosted by anchor Brian Williams.
CNN appeared to take the cake for visuals, however. Collaborating with the Empire State Building, the news network turned New York’s tallest skyscraper into a lit-up spectacle depicting the race with blue and red LED lights. The “spire” served as a real-time tracker for viewers to gauge the total number of electoral votes for each candidate, with an assurance that the victor’s color would overtake the entire top of the building when the winner was announced.  
FOX News’ appeal for viewers was highly concentrated in the controversial nature of its hosts and interviewees; particularly Karl Rove, a former member of President George W. Bush’s White House staff and an avid supporter of and donor to Romney’s campaign this year. Gov. Sarah Palin made an appearance as well, commenting at one point on the impending victory for President Barack Obama, that “this is a perplexing time for all of us.” Coupled with the shock value of Rove’s outright objection to the moment when various networks determined that Obama had indeed been victorious, as well as others such as NBC and CNN, Fox News surely put on a show in itself for viewers. 
Times were less fortunate for ABC News, whose election coverage was stunted by a sudden loss of power in their studio in Times Square. Amidst perhaps the most pressurized half hour of the night in which the election was ultimately decided, program anchors Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos fumbled in the dark in search of a way to continue their commentary on the polls and electoral vote results. If that wasn’t enough, viewers and Twitter users, were delighted to raise questions about Sawyer’s hilarious show as she stumbled over words and referred to the incumbent as “President Barack.”
The winner of the presidential election luckily proved to be a clearly defined decision, with Obama capturing the victory eventually with 303 total electoral votes. The question remains a matter of choice for viewers, however, as to who won out for the best election coverage this past Tuesday. Some might say NBC was the clear winner, with the highest viewership of any news network at 12.6 million total viewers. 
But don’t let the numbers be the judge. With the variety of approaches to coverage on election night, the true winner for best network coverage can be left to the viewer’s choice.

Social media heightens political party divide
By Maddie Ecker
Being a student at the most politically active campus comes with certain perks, especially during the presidential election. Over the past few weeks AU has been buzzing with political talk. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, I am sure you made your opinions known and am sure that if we are Facebook friends, I probably read one of your angry tirades. 
This election was broadcasted from all sorts of social networking sites like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, to name a few. If you partook in the festivities at the School of International Service building on the night of the election, you noticed that there was at least one television screen was monitoring incoming tweets throughout the night. Facebook feeds were dedicated entirely to people’s opinions on the two candidates and, of course, the people of the party they opposed.  Instagram was peppered with pictures of students at the White House.
While all these forms of media help bring attention to certain issues, I found that most people overstepped what social media sites are intended for and instead used them to tear down other people’s opinions and wage “open” war. While sites such as Facebook were invented to help people connect with each other, I highly doubt that Mark Zuckerberg planned on his masterpiece to be used to create political chaos. 
I like being “in the know” about current events, and when I say current I mean minute by minute. However, I thought that the stream of angry opinions and intolerant attitudes demonstrated on election night promoted exactly what America needs to avoid: the divide between the two parties. If anything, Facebook should be used to promote the ideas of the Democratic and Republican parties, instead of being used to tear the opposing party down. Honestly, what does that kind of attitude do in progressing us further? 
When it comes down to it, I do not think that posting anything anywhere contributes to actually getting anything done. Get up and get involved, but do it in a way that demonstrates respect for other people’s ideas and actually emphasizes your ideas.

The fight for youth and minority votes continues
By Scott Weathers
In all its tame predictability, the 2012 presidential election revealed more about the American electorate than any race in recent memory. Certainly, the campaign was intensely fought, but to anyone following presidential polls (or more specifically, Nate Silver’s 535 blog), the outcome was nothing new. More surprisingly, even though the 2012 election felt uninspiring and ugly compared to 2008, the re-election of President Barack Obama was a product of profound changes that should continue to affect American politics.
Most heartening, according to exit polling, a record 19 percent of the American electorate in 2012 was young voters who overwhelmingly voted for Obama. Now, only a superficial assessment of this fact would conclude that this represents a monolithic victory for the Democrats. Certainly Obama carried the youth vote handily, but past Democratic nominees like John Kerry and Al Gore performed worse among the youth vote. In order for this change to actually alter our political dynamic, Democrats must continue to nominate politicians that appeal to younger voters.
The same goes for minority representation. With Romney failing to capture any substantial portion of the Latino or African-American vote, Republicans are understandably fearful for their party’s future. But Democrats would be short-sighted to assume that these groups will continue to support their party without meaningful legislation and relevant candidates.
All of these factors combined for an Obama victory, even in the face of an opposition that backpedaled on most unpopular Republican positions. A Romney victory looked most plausible immediately after his first debate victory when he adopted more moderate positions. Still, this swing to the center was not enough to overcome demographic changes, Romney’s positions during primary season and effective campaigning by Obama. 
After the 2008 election, I was confident that Obama’s messaging would resonate through our political system, producing a more liberal, cooperative consensus. GOP victories in 2010 proved me wrong. I was mistaken in assuming that the dynamics of our political campaigns could permanently change a bitter culture in Washington. However, I can say that despite the lack of inspiration, change and optimism in 2012, there is reason for modest, humble hope for America’s political future.

Collaborating with the Empire State Building, the news network turned New York’s tallest skyscraper into a lit-up spectacle depicting the race with blue and red LED lights. The “spire” served as a real-time tracker for viewers to gauge the total number of electoral votes for each candidate, with an assurance that the victor’s color would overtake the entire top of the building when the winner was announced.  
FOX News’ appeal for viewers was highly concentrated in the controversial nature of its hosts and interviewees; particularly Karl Rove, a former member of President George W. Bush’s White House staff and an avid supporter of and donor to Romney’s campaign this year. Gov. Sarah Palin made an appearance as well, commenting at one point on the impending victory for President Barack Obama, that “this is a perplexing time for all of us.” Coupled with the shock value of Rove’s outright objection to the moment when various networks determined that Obama had indeed been victorious, as well as others such as NBC and CNN, Fox News surely put on a show in itself for viewers. 
Times were less fortunate for ABC News, whose election coverage was stunted by a sudden loss of power in their studio in Times Square. Amidst perhaps the most pressurized half hour of the night in which the election was ultimately decided, program anchors Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos fumbled in the dark in search of a way to continue their commentary on the polls and electoral vote results. If that wasn’t enough, viewers and Twitter users, were delighted to raise questions about Sawyer’s hilarious show as she stumbled over words and referred to the incumbent as “President Barack.”
The winner of the presidential election luckily proved to be a clearly defined decision, with Obama capturing the victory eventually with 303 total electoral votes. The question remains a matter of choice for viewers, however, as to who won out for the best election coverage this past Tuesday. Some might say NBC was the clear winner, with the highest viewership of any news network at 12.6 million total viewers. 
But don’t let the numbers be the judge. With the variety of approaches to coverage on election night, the true winner for best network coverage can be left to the viewer’s choice.

Social media heightens political party divide
By Maddie Ecker
Being a student at the most politically active campus comes with certain perks, especially during the presidential election. Over the past few weeks AU has been buzzing with political talk. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, I am sure you made your opinions known and am sure that if we are Facebook friends, I probably read one of your angry tirades. 
This election was broadcasted from all sorts of social networking sites like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, to name a few. If you partook in the festivities at the School of International Service building on the night of the election, you noticed that there was at least one television screen was monitoring incoming tweets throughout the night. Facebook feeds were dedicated entirely to people’s opinions on the two candidates and, of course, the people of the party they opposed.  Instagram was peppered with pictures of students at the White House.
While all these forms of media help bring attention to certain issues, I found that most people overstepped what social media sites are intended for and instead used them to tear down other people’s opinions and wage “open” war. While sites such as Facebook were invented to help people connect with each other, I highly doubt that Mark Zuckerberg planned on his masterpiece to be used to create political chaos. 
I like being “in the know” about current events, and when I say current I mean minute by minute. However, I thought that the stream of angry opinions and intolerant attitudes demonstrated on election night promoted exactly what America needs to avoid: the divide between the two parties. If anything, Facebook should be used to promote the ideas of the Democratic and Republican parties, instead of being used to tear the opposing party down. Honestly, what does that kind of attitude do in progressing us further? 
When it comes down to it, I do not think that posting anything anywhere contributes to actually getting anything done. Get up and get involved, but do it in a way that demonstrates respect for other people’s ideas and actually emphasizes your ideas.

The fight for youth and minority votes continues
By Scott Weathers
In all its tame predictability, the 2012 presidential election revealed more about the American electorate than any race in recent memory. Certainly, the campaign was intensely fought, but to anyone following presidential polls (or more specifically, Nate Silver’s 535 blog), the outcome was nothing new. More surprisingly, even though the 2012 election felt uninspiring and ugly compared to 2008, the re-election of President Barack Obama was a product of profound changes that should continue to affect American politics.
Most heartening, according to exit polling, a record 19 percent of the American electorate in 2012 was young voters who overwhelmingly voted for Obama. Now, only a superficial assessment of this fact would conclude that this represents a monolithic victory for the Democrats. Certainly Obama carried the youth vote handily, but past Democratic nominees like John Kerry and Al Gore performed worse among the youth vote. In order for this change to actually alter our political dynamic, Democrats must continue to nominate politicians that appeal to younger voters.
The same goes for minority representation. With Romney failing to capture any substantial portion of the Latino or African-American vote, Republicans are understandably fearful for their party’s future. But Democrats would be short-sighted to assume that these groups will continue to support their party without meaningful legislation and relevant candidates.
All of these factors combined for an Obama victory, even in the face of an opposition that backpedaled on most unpopular Republican positions. A Romney victory looked most plausible immediately after his first debate victory when he adopted more moderate positions. Still, this swing to the center was not enough to overcome demographic changes, Romney’s positions during primary season and effective campaigning by Obama. 
After the 2008 election, I was confident that Obama’s messaging would resonate through our political system, producing a more liberal, cooperative consensus. GOP victories in 2010 proved me wrong. I was mistaken in assuming that the dynamics of our political campaigns could permanently change a bitter culture in Washington. However, I can say that despite the lack of inspiration, change and optimism in 2012, there is reason for modest, humble hope for America’s political future.

The U.S’s most infamous con artist is coming to AU on Nov. 15.
Frank Abagnale will be speaking to students at 7:00 p.m. in MGC University Club. The Kennedy Political Union will host the event. 
Abagnale started his career as a con man in the 1960s. During that time he cashed $2.5 million in fraudulent checks and escaped from police custody twice while pretending to be an airline pilot, an attorney, a college professor and a pediatrician. 
When he was 21 he was caught by the French police but served less than five years in prison before he was released on the condition that he help the U.S. federal government fight crime.
Since then he has developed and implemented numerous fraud prevention programs for the FBI and has been selected as a member of CNN Financial News’s “Pinnacle 400”, for his success in his field.
He published an autobiography titled “Catch Me If You Can” in 1980. The book was later turned into a film directed by Steven Spielberg and a Tony-Award winning musical.

Two filmmakers want you to know that the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were lies. 
At least, that’s what filmmaker Oliver Stone and AU Professor Peter Kuznick’s new documentary series wants you to believe. Stone and Kuznick screened an episode of their 10-part documentary series, “The Untold History of America,” and answered questions about the upcoming show and book at Ward on Nov. 8.
Stone is known for making politically charged films, so the pairing for the documentary makes perfect sense. His film “W,” which highlights the personal issues of President George W. Bush, made a splash in 2008, while his earlier military-driven films “Born on the Fourth of July” and “Platoon” were nominated for Oscars in the late ‘80s (with “Platoon” actually taking home the golden statue for Best Picture in 1986). 
Kuznick introduced the series as a “history of the American empire” ranging from World War I to present day, including the presidency of Barack Obama.  
The series, beginning Nov. 12 airing at 8p.m. on Mondays on Showtime, aims to “puncture the common American myths,” Kuznick said. It began as one documentary, based on the 1944 Democratic Convention when President Harry Truman was chosen to be on the ticket above the favorite, Henry Wallace.
The general idea behind exposing this injustice was to highlight the fact that had Wallace, a vocal supporter of equality and peace, been chosen, he could have gone on to become president and avoided Truman’s mistakes.
The first episode, shown at the event on campus, was about Truman’s decision to drop nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The episode argues that Truman lied to the American people, making them believe that the bombs were necessary to win the war when the Japanese had surrendered three months earlier.
Kuznick and Stone have been working on the project for about eleven years, 11 of which were for filming, since the movie required extensive research. During that time, they also collaborated in the classroom, with Kuznick teaching a course titled “Oliver Stone’s America” at AU. 
The documentary project started when Stone sat in on one of Kuznick’s class and heard the story of Wallace. Stone was immediately hooked, saying he “could not get the story out of his head for years.”
Stone was raised in a conservative household and dropped out of Yale University to volunteer in Vietnam. Kuznick pointed out that several of Stone’s friends from the war claim that he even saved their lives. 
In regards to handling criticism, Stone said he is “empathetic towards these political figures, not sympathetic…and there’s a difference.”
The project was important to Stone because he “felt the urge to do something while [he] is still alive.”
“Only 12 percent of Americans are proficient in U.S. history, and the little that people do know, it’s often wrong,” Kuznick said. “That’s what we’re trying to combat.”
“It’s better to know the truth before you die,” Stone said, “or at least some version that’s a little closer to the truth.”

• CAUS- I'm all for freedom of assembly but respect your peers and don't bang pots and pans at 11 PM. That does not get the administration's attention, it just annoys other students. 
• wish that i believed in fate. wish i didn't sleep so late. 
• C'mon CAUSE, it's quiet hours!
• Why does Shepard Smith still work at Fox News? He must have the patience of a saint.
• @Congrats, liberal tools: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought equal rights, pay equity, addressing health disparities, and accepting ALL  families WERE FAMILY VALUES. 
My bad.
(Also, I'll take that veiled insult as a point of pride.)
• There is such a large population of student-athletes who are participating at the club level at AU and they continually go without any praise/coverage/respect. This semester the Equestrian Team placed 5th on the east coast and the Women's Rugby team won the Potomac Rugby Union Championship... Cmon Eagle, I thought you were a "campus" newspaper. 
• CAUS I don't who's your chief organizer for protests and such but fire them because judging from LA quad residents's statuses you might have lost a good chunk of support because of tonight's stunt
• @"Hope the taste of division and destruction of family values is nice for you" I actually really hope family values are destroyed.  Families are dumb.

• To the kids who woke me up by protesting high tuition outside of my window, I need sleep so I can wake up and go to my two jobs tomorrow to support myself and pay for school. As an American you have the liberty to choose where you go to school. If you don't like how much you pay, get out.
• The CAUS makes me so incredibly disappointed in the university I attend. President Kerwin is a man with a family who is entitled to privacy and respect. Storming his house in the middle of the night is unbelievably disrespectful and harassing. You want to have a productive conversation? Act like adults, not immature children throwing temper tantrums. And yes. He's accountable to a Board of Trustees. It's how the real world works, and it's designed to benefit you to the fullest. Get. Over. It. 
• The CAUS is annoying, skews facts to fit their worldview, underlines the obvious and managed to disturb every single person on campus tonight. I rarely side with the establishment, but seriously, come on. If you wanted to have a stake in your tuition, it make sense to go to a public university.
• The Marxists need to go away. Go debate about the merits of the 4th Internationale vis-a-vis the Comintern away from my Rants.

She was just a huge part of my life, there's still a void I've been trying to fill. I think maybe talking to your ex would help you find that closure. I hope to find that for myself.
• "I totally support the single’s get together or speed dating idea!  Hall councils, student government? Get to it. *clap clap*": No, let's make this single's dating service something we students set up organically! *Spontaneous order*! But seriously. . . let's get on this, okay?
• @"Can someone at the Eagle explain why AU students going to an Obama rally get coverage, while Republican students have been doing the same stuff and get no coverage": AMEN! Thank you for noticing this!!!!
• @"And more often than not, they have quite a sexual drive under that nice religious guy exterior. Anyway, good luck!" - Speaking as one of the "nice religious guys", I can tell you that whoever made this observation is 100% correct. We're looking for love, for the woman who will draw us closer to God. . . and not all of us believe in pre-marital chastity :)
• Dear "<3 hot single girl": If we flirt with you, ask you for coffee, etc, we're NOT gay. Short of initiating sex with every girl he meets, what does a straight guy at AU have to do to convince you ladies that we're not all gay?! Seriously! - Exasperated Straight Male
• @"whatever floor" girl in McDowell: I can't wait to meet you :)
• "How do you get your friends to stop coming and staying in your room every single evening/night without being rude? It's becoming and a habit and it's starting to get annoying…" - I think I know who you are. Just ask them to stop, explain you have work sometimes or are really tired. Offer to grab lunch or coffee with them during the day. They should understand.
• "If voting changed anything, they'd make it illegal." - Yup. @RulingPoliticalClass
• Seriously AU: SPEED DATING let's make this happen okay?
• "I am so sick to my stomach for what tomorrow will be like at AU. I'm devastated for the country but everyone else will be celebrating." Agreed. Can we set up a conservatives' support group? I feel like AUCRs is already becoming that :/

How can you so enthusiastically celebrate this man's reelection? According to multiple reports you can find from The New York Times, Washington Post, etc, he personally signs off on every drone strike. This is horrific and a clear abuse of human rights on par with the Bush years. Where is the outrage?
• "Sometimes I just want a friend. I'm lonely. But then I remember that I don't like anyone (including myself)." I'm so sorry you're going through this. I'd definitely recommend joining a student club or group of interest to you. If you're religious, look into joining a church, temple, synagogue, etc (or if atheist/agnostic/humanist there are many secular groups). Hang in there ;)
• @"SO many people read eagle rants everyday." True. I have no idea if you meant to be writing to me hahaha, but I hope you're doing okay. If you are who I think you are: I miss you so much come back into my life!
• @"i just wish you’d talk to me again": I feel the same way :)
• @"Im too sexually frustated ... this sucks its like drinking is the only way to hook up with girls :(" - I'm sorry you're frustrated with that. I'm in the same boat as you are, man. Trust me, from my experience, hooking up while drunk is a BAD idea. If you want to meet a girl who you'll really like, who will be great for you, the time is not when you're both drinking and dealing with baggage and sadness from the past.
• @"My heart hurts.": I'm sorry for your pain. Mine does too :( Why does yours hurt? Hope you're doing okay!
• @"I'm sorry. So sorry.": Why are you sorry?
• @" I'm scared I'm going crazy." Why???
• @" I'm sure that guy I saw wearing a t-shirt with "vagitarian" written on it gets laid like JFK." I sure hope not. If he does, women at AU need to raise their standards. . . . 
• I miss you and love you so much. I just want to hold you in my arms and kiss you forever.
• @"I'm scared."- Why are you scared? =(
• SCREW YOU UBUNTU MY TOUCHPAD ISN'T WORKING
• Next time CAUS decides to hold an illegal protest, bust out the tear gas and the nightsticks.
• Congratulations, ignorant Liberal Tools.  You have effectively driven the final nail into the coffin of what used to be a great country.  Hope the taste of division and destruction of family values is nice for you.  
IT DOES! mmmmmm equality yumyumyum.
• CAUS is destorying the opportunity to reason with the administration of American University. What are you willing to give up for a tuition freeze, CAUS? That isn't free. This is a tuition based institution. How did you go from 5% tuition increases to a tuition freeze? What happened to the 5% we can compromise on? Your extremism does not display your dedication to the cause; it displays your dedication to the CAUS. There is an important difference between the two.
• @ Family values: bet that's what people said 50 years ago when we elected presidents who would fight for desegregation. There is only one "family value," and that's love. 
• @bipartisan relationship: Why are you dating a man who doesn't know when election day is in the first place?
• seriously, CAUS? what the hell is wrong with you? banging pots and pans outside of someone's door at 11:30 pm is OBVIOUSLY  a really smart way to get a serious quote and a really thoughtful discussion on tuition freeze...
• @people looking for speed dating: Go work at the phonathon. It's free (you'll actually make money!) and there are really cool people down there. Sit next to a different person each week and talk for the 3.75 hours. Boom! Instant speed dating!
• Number of whistleblowers prosecuted by Obama under the Espionage Act: 6
Number of whistleblowers prosecuted in the entire pre-Obama history of the Espionage Act: 3
• I'm not that attractive and I'm not that skinny, but I'm a nice person. Anybody want to hit a lonely lady up? :(
• Give Bon Appetit workers higher wages and more hours!!! Why are we paying all of this money if people working on this campus are being exploited????
• Smoking ban? wtf? Do we not have individual freedom on campus anymore?
• blond curly headed boy who lives in the berks......sigh........
• CAUS kids need a new gameplan
• you're so pretty you make the mona lisa look like she has eyebrows
• girl desperate for a proposal here. So my bf of 4 years said he would propose and we can get married if I agree to a sexually open marriage. He said all guys eventually cheat and at least this way he is honest with me from the start and never hides things. I know from my evolutionary psychology class that men are not programmed to be monogamous creatures. Cognitively I understand. But it still hurts. Although I think it will hurt less than not having him in my life. Am I wrong to agree to the open marriage?
• I'm sorry, but CAUS rioting outside of Kerwin's home is stupid. Just stupid. I don't want tuition hikes either, but going to his home? Claps for you guys for giving AU students a bad name.
• A guy in the dav currently has whiskers painted on his face and is wearing cat ears. I just want to know why.
• The eagle just isn't interesting anymore. The articles used to be so much more politically aligned and controversial. Now its just boring news that we for the most part already know. This editor is the worst I've seen in my 4 years here.
• I believe in a thing called love, just listen to the rhythm of my heart
• Someone in my 200 level political theory class didn't know who Nietzsche was. She then proceeded to make a considerable fool of herself.  
• Just thinking, the CAUS deserves some credit for gaining fame so quickly.. even if it comes at the expense of everyone hating them. Props

• RuPaul's Drag Race All-Stars has been incredibly disappointing.
• Not my fault I kiss better than his girlfriend
• My roommate is the one who ranted a couple days ago about how she didn't remember if she ranted the "I think I'm going crazy" rant. She just said "You're going to die" completely seriously and out of the blue. Then she said she had no idea why she said it. She IS going crazy.
• Geez you annoy me, why do I have to live with you.
• Don't know why some of my friends are complaining about the CAUS march last night. I'm already in debt and will be way more so if these tuition hikes happen so it's good to see people really getting on Kerwin's case about this. Wake the guy up every night if it'll encourage him to back off the hikes in order to make it stop! Hope there's more stuff like this.

• Hey you. I know you rant almost day so I know you will read this. I don't know what more I have to do to say I'm sorry. I was an idiot when I ended our friendship and you won't respond to my texts now. I miss being friends with you and spending late nights at the library with you. I won't take you for granted and I was a huge idiot. Please forgive me because I miss hanging out with you.
• @Hughes4th - the woozles will cool down eventually. Sooner or later they'll all get in one mass hookup and realize they hate each other. Then: Peace.
• No matter what you think about Neil Kerwin as a professional, he's entitled to the human courtesy of having privacy at his personal home. Let's go to all the CAUS members' doors in the middle of the night and yell and scream at that. See how that feels. It's just rude and disrespectful to him and his family. 
• Hate CAUS. They don't represent the larger student body, they represent the 20 of them who like to whine about EVERYTHING. To them, no one has rights except for them. Do other students have the right to quiet in the middle of the night? Nope. Do businesses like Bon Appetit have the right to fire employees who break their established rules? Nope. Does Kerwin have the right to a private life? Nope. I literally hate them and their entitled attitudes. Please leave AU. We all hate you.
