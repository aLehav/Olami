Interest in mosquito control has increased for some Northwest D.C. residents after an unidentified resident complained about the West Nile Virus (WNV) at an Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) meeting on July 11.
Humans can contract WNV through mosquito bites, which can cause health issues ranging from a fever to meningitis. However, only 20 percent of humans infected with the virus develop a fever, according to the Center for Disease Control. 
A Department of Health factsheet published on March 20 confirms three cases of WNV in Ward 3 out of seven cases citywide.
All three cases of WNV in Ward 3 during 2011 were located near the city’s northwestern border, according to the factsheet.
While there is no human vaccine to prevent the WNV, there are a number of precautions that can be taken to prevent infection. According to the CDC, the simplest way to avoid infection is to remain indoors between dusk and dawn, the prime biting hours for mosquitoes that carry the virus.
When staying indoors is not an option, the CDC recommends a combination of long clothing and the use of over-the-counter insect repellents.
Stephanie DeStefano, the grounds operations coordinator at AU, said the grounds personnel do not typically spray for mosquitoes to avoid killing beneficial insects that live alongside mosquitoes.
Instead, the grounds personnel empty pools of standing water often to prevent mosquito populations from expanding, according to DeStefano. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in pools of standing water, which can be prevented by replacing the water every seven days, ANC Commissioner Kent Slowinski said. The water is occasionally treated with a “mosquito dunk,” a pellet containing bacteria that specifically targets mosquito larvae, DeStefano said.
Some AU students witnessed large amounts of mosquitoes in off-campus housing in the past, while others have had very few encounters with the insects.
“They were pretty bad at the Berks,” said Francesca Campbell, a School of Public Affairs alumna, referring to an apartment building near campus that houses many AU students. “There were a lot inside the apartments.”

•@Girl who celebrates Half Christmas: Way to keep it real, the world could use more holidays.
•@ wtf there are no chase banks in dc and there is no buffalo wild wings.
To this guy,
I live near one. They exist.
•I think that there is a fine line between debates and arguments. And my class definitely dances on that line. I don't see anything wrong with debates because it sharpens the mind and opens it up to different perspectives. I've personally learned a lot during these debates/arguments. However, I see how we can seem very immature. Can an upperclassman who will not curse me out tell me what you think about my view of this situation?
•The more I read into the 2016 group the more I get scared that I totally made the wrong choice...-Hope its the right choice
•I'd like the 2016ers a lot more if they would quit ranting. Until you are an AU student, you do not deserve to rant. And you only become an AU student when you order Wingo's blacked out, find your favorite secret bathroom for secret pooping, and/or hookup on Kerwin's lawn.
•Financial Aid Office.. Thats that s*** I DONT like
•I wonder when the (like 50 total) posters in the 2016 group will realize posting in it will not get you laid...
•I miss the 2016 Livestream movie nights!  Those were the BEST to watch.  So many awkward nerds trying to flirt over the internet.  Should'uv gone to MIT
•some ppl onda 2016need to stfU
•The class of 2016 Facebook page depresses me..and I'm an incoming freshman. FML.
•Dear 2016ers,
YOU.ARE.DOING.IT.ALL.WRONG. You're supposed to wait until **after** you get to AU to start hating each other, and excluding people. Like after welcome week at least. You havent even drunkenly hooked up with each other or figured out if the cute guy on your floor is gay or not yet! Youre still supposed to love each other right now!
•Can't wait until the 2016ers get all dressed up during welcome week to try to get into frat parties. Some ego's are going to get knocked down a few thousand pegs.
•*kanye shrug*
•What is a "good friendly SSS"?
•@NBColympics.com editor's note: Actually all I hadto do was SAY I had cable and I was able to see all the olympic events online without actually having cable. Guess it doesn't work for everyone. But worth a try.
•@west coast AU equivalent, I would say Santa Clara University, with Stanford being the Georgetown and USC being the GW
•How can I see this class of 2016 page that everyone is talking about? Can non class of 2016 people see it?
•So I've decided t drop out of my PhD program. I feel so much relief. Time to read all the good books that I have been putting off reading since high school.
•If a guy never talks about your future together does that mean he doesn't see a future with you or that maybe he does doesn't really talk about the future. Because my bf doesn't talk about his own future that much but it really bugs me that when I talk about us being married he just says nothing. Thoughts?
•If I were an olympian I would so want to compete on trampoline.
•So my mom says she can't afford my tuition because money is tight. Then she adds on to our 2 million dollar house with brand new renovations to almost every room. Glad your priorities are straight mother. F*** You.
•Dear class of 2016: don't worry, most upperclassmen haven't formed an opinion of you yet. Unless you've posted videos or argued about something stupid, in which case we have your name down for rush. Love, sorority gals.
•All these 2016 rants are making me realize that having weekly summer rants rather than daily was probably a blessing in disguise.
•The AU portal sucks. The AU portal accessed abroad sucks worse.
•are you kidding me? Emily yu puts her sorority little in a student government position. nice to know that sg is still corrupt as ever.
•campus,
calm yourselves, join WVAU.
•To the person who suggested Loyola Marymount is the west coast equivalent of AU: I don't think so, they don't have nearly as many people majoring in SIS / poli sci. Also, they have a lot of science majors.
•Can everyone just be hapyp and postive while we enjoy our last few days of summer break?
•@“blah blah blah will be available to the student through their own portal” also known as maze. really AU, can we not use those billions of tuition dollars towards organization?
Trust me, you'd be thanking your lucky stars if you saw the student portal for my non-AU grad school program. It is awful; the AU portal is a thousand times better.
And WOW, why are there so many incoming freshmen on Eagle Rants now? Who spilled the beans?
•My hometown's mayor's profile picture on Facebook is of Mayor Quimby from The Simpsons. This is my life.
•@"I hope the Eagle doesn't record IP addresses" - even if they did, they would only know the general area from which you posted. If they wanted to find out exactly who you are, they would need a warrant to demand that information from your ISP.
•I am baffled about how many of my friends are getting engaged/married or having babies. When did we get that old?
/especially awkward since I've never had a significant other. Oops.
•I joined the 2016 Facebook group then left a week later when the people posting seemed strange, but now I feel like I'm missing out on all the entertainment lol
•Today I played a prank on the entire dining room by replacing all of the decaf coffee with regular.  The two are completely indistinguishable once someone (like me) has filled an empty decaf container with regular and put it back on the shelf.  I feel a little guilty because I know it was wrong to do, but all the guests this week are a**holes, and they deserve it.  Never piss off your waiter.
•Girl looking for a "Devil's Threeway," name the time and place... To everyone else the key is no eye contact...
•" @ freshman "wtf there are no chase banks in dc and there is no buffalo wild wings or wingstop wtf" I KNOW !! I am from Chi-city and this is a major issue. You should open up a cap one account so you can deposit $
•@Disney Princess appreciation club: what, you don't think boys are capable of princess appreciation? YOU MISANDRIST!
•That awkward moment when you realize you're already friends with that guy you've been flirting with on Grindr.
•That awkward moment when your sister's high school prom date gives you his number and says "we should hang out one day ;)"
...you're a guy.
•I don't get how we are supposed to be an accepting school and already shutting out a group of people. Give the 2016ers a chance.
•west coast equivalent of AU would probably be the University of San Francisco, or possibly Seattle University? Idk
•The only thing more revolting than SPA Leadership is seeing all your spaleader classmates stalking the new class. "BABIEEEEES." Ugh.
•Lol no one comments on eagle rants ever

AU alumni Dan Lindner and John Sonsalla made The Hill’s annual "50 Most Beautiful People" list on July 25.
The Hill is a newspaper focused on business and political activities in Congress and has the largest print circulation on Capitol Hill at over 24,000.
The paper’s readers sent in 400 nominations of most beautiful people working on Capitol Hill, according to the Hill’s Features Editor Kris Kitto. After going through the nominations, The Hill staff invited 80 nominees to a photo shoot and then voted on the top 50.
“We basically look at who took the best photo and after we choose, we get to know them a little better,” Kitto said. “Just because someone is good-looking does not mean that they can take a great picture.”
Lindner, who graduated from the School of Public Affairs in 2011 with a Masters in Applied Politics, is currently a press assistant for Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif. He said he was surprised to find himself on the list. 
“When I got the phone call from The Hill, it was a pretty secretive experience,” Lindner said. “They don’t let you know in advance if you’ve made the cut, so you basically show up for a photo shoot and an interview, and then have to wait and see if you’re in the issue.”
Like Lindner, Sonsalla was surprised and wary of his nomination.
“When I was first contacted by The Hill, I thought it was one of my friends having a good laugh at my expense,” Sonsalla said. “Afterward, I found out that I had been nominated by a few people in my office.” 
Sonsalla graduated from SPA in 2011 as well with a double major in Political Science and CLEG (Communications, Legal Institutions, Economics and Government). He currently works as a policy assistant at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP, a lobbying firm in D.C.
During their time at AU, Sonsalla and Linder were active in school and internships. Sonsalla held four internships both on and off Capitol Hill, participated in the SPA Leadership program and served as president of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. Lindner interned at the Environmental Protection Agency and wrote speeches for an unnamed member of President Obama’s cabinet while teaching a class on Congressional behavior as a graduate assistant. 
Both Lindner and Sonsalla give AU credit for their careers in politics.
“I credit my time at American with helping me find my professional trajectory and developing the skills I need to succeed in communications,” Lindner said.
Sonsalla emphasized AU’s location as a key factor in his own political success.
 “American provides its students with an opportunity to study government under some of the leading professionals in the District and the invaluable experience of being directly involved in the political process,” Sonsalla said.
With all the serious work done on the Hill, Kitto said, The Hill runs the 50 Most Beautiful People List because it is a fun and light feature that always works well in summer.
“Overall, it was a fun experience to be chosen, but all credit goes to my Mom for the good looks,” Sonsalla said.

When “The Bourne Identity” first came out in theaters in 2002, it introduced a new type of action hero. Gone was the suave, debonair class of James Bond. Jason Bourne was a gritty, morally ambiguous and ruthless killer who ushered in a new age of modern action films, fitting for the disillusionment of the post-9/11 era. 
But 10 years later, what happens after the birth of the modern action movie?
Not much it seems. “The Bourne Legacy” retreads a lot of old ground, literally. Half of the movie takes place during the events of “The Bourne Ultimatum,” the third film in the original trilogy. The film immediately throws in a new group of characters who are there to clean up the mess that Bourne made. In order to prevent the news media from uncovering any more of the CIA’s many black ops programs, this group of bona fide government janitors, led by Edward Norton’s (“Moonrise Kingdom”) Colonel Eric Byer, decide to kill all their field agents in Operation Outcome.
Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner, “The Avengers”) is one of these agents, though he spends much of the beginning of the film climbing mountains while blissfully unaware of the doomed fate his superiors have planned for him. When he catches on, he seeks out his former doctor Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz, “Dream House”), a research scientist working on genetic enhancement, and together they go on a globe-trotting expedition.
As with many an overambitious film, the tone is quite uneven. The beginning seamlessly continues the frantic, edgy pace of the previous film. But with little context and no strong characters to latch on to, the viewer becomes lost. The film tries desperately to link itself to Bourne, but the connection is weak at best.
It’s when the movie steps out from under the shadow of Bourne and lets Cross take the reins. Renner is magnetic, charismatic and surprisingly sassy in the role as the last living agent in his program. He carries the movie with ease, brooding at the appropriate moments and pulling off the fight scenes with a kind of smug bravado. He’s an utterly captivating actor to watch, though he deserves a better action movie than this.
The rest of the cast paled in comparison, except for perhaps Norton. He gave a restrained, but had a subtly menacing performance as Byer. Sadly, Norton and Renner only had one short flashback together, barely enough time for any sort of satisfying showdown.
As the love interest, Weisz was naturally relegated to a more submissive role. However, her character was unimpressive, though Weisz did get the chance to look constantly frenzied and panicked.
“The Bourne Legacy” lacks the grand conspiracy plots of its predecessors, putting on the illusion of complexity with fast cuts and loaded dialogue. But it all comes down to a simple plot of cat-and-mouse, which when done well is an action movie at its finest.
