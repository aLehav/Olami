• I really hate seeing the WONK ads in Metro Stations and Newspapers. AU's name already makes it seem like it's a For-Profit college.
• Just read about how terrible AU's previous president, Ben Ladner was and all of the embezzlement charges that were brought against him. All I can say is GOD BLESS CORNEILIUS KERWIN.
• So I'm in a long distance relationship this summer and it sucks!  Can we petition to have school start earlier? I need to get back to DC live/my lovely.
• Holla to the people who would rather enhance their mind with classes at AU over the summer than get "work experience" bringing someone coffee.
