• The dance team is looking bangin'.
• 9 minuets until I can get my package!
• @ religious beliefs and gender neutral bathrooms. I didn't say "replace all bathrooms ever with gender neutral ones". I'd just like the option to exist
• UNDIE RUN UNDIE RUN UNDIE RUN. that sounds AWESOME
• @undie run. YESSSS
I know at least two people who would definitely do it.
• If you think the 2 billion Christians in the world ALL take the Bible completely literally, then you're the crazy one. And I think you missed the point. Just be respectful of other peoples' religions, no matter what they may be, and expect them to be respectful of yours/lack thereof. The only rule is to not be an asshole. Thanks and God bless.
• One does not simply survive the phonathon...
• @"@Gender neutral bathroom person.  Did you ever consider that maybe you're the one who is closed-minded for not considering that many people have conflicts with it due to their religion and beliefs." Um religion is a choice; being transgendered is not.
• I don't read long rants.
• Tim McBride wears patriotic boxers. I would know. I've seen them.
• Sometimes a bro just wants to get laid.
• @person wanting tips for stolen laptop: Here's a tip. Don't leave your door unlocked. And don't leave you stuff unattended at the library (as hundreds of signs warn against). I don't know your situation, but if you did leave your door unlocked or your stuff unattended, I do not feel sorry for you at all. Learn some common sense.
• @"I don't know how half the people in Kogod graduated from high school." This is true of any business school. New york times ran stories on this issue a few months back about how business students never develop their full potential of critical thought because they are always doing group projects and never get to think independently.
• @people who think eagle writers/editors/photographers get paid: lol Are you really that clueless? Can you name one college newspaper in the country that pays its writers? It's a college extracurricular, not a career.
• @future SAHM (mom lingo for stay-at-home-mom): Don't let naysayers get you down. I also want to be a stay at home mom right after college and grad school (well, for me right after two grad degrees). I want to study anthropology and creative writing in grad school. And I know fulfilling my academic goals before I am a mom will make me a more mature and confident mother.
• Please put the rants on the left side of the website rather than the far right. It's really frustrating and annoying to have to expand the webpage in order to view the rants.
• What religion is against gender-neutral bathrooms? I can't find that in my bible...
• Jobs board is back in existence, but not functioning at all. Used cars? Please explain.
• "I will not give up hope. I was hooked from the start, when I noticed your kind and your powerful heart. So notice me... "
• Bacon sucks
• @AoE girl: ahhhh so much nostalgia. Haven't played it in so long but soo good. Might just have to reinstall it..
• We have a class called critical whiteness? was that a typo? And if not can someone please explain to me what that is? Inquiring minds wish to know
• Side-eyeing the "Drooling Democrats" editorial...
• OMFG, what is this wind??
• StarCraft tournament?  Woo-Hoo!
• Eagle Secure hit a new low for me just now: I was watching a five minute video for my Health class when Eagle Secure crapped out halfway through it.
ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY LOG IN TO EAGLESECURE.
• Dear girls who want to meet guys in 446,
I think you mean 445 because 446 is a room full of girls.
Sincerely,
444
• @ "You're in COLLEGE and you don't wash your hands after you go to the bathroom? That's horrifying."
This, this, this, a million times this. College has made me come to the sad realization that just because someone is reasonably intelligent and educated, does not mean that they have an understanding of basic hygiene. Or maybe they're just inconsiderate.  Either way, stop being gross!
• I sent you a letter - gatita
• "This is a star?"
"This is a f***ing star! I run it! I'm your boss!"
"You're Mister Stevens?"
• I left AU and since moved to California... but I still read rants sometimes :) And it makes me feel better to know I wasn't the only one that felt really alone and left out while I was there. It was soo hard to make friends and no way in hell was I joining a sorority! Although going to community college now makes me wish I didn't complain about the campus so much!
• every valentines day that goes by, you'll always be my favorite.
• How will I knooOOoow if he really loves me? I say a prayer with every heartbeat! I fall in love whenever we meeEEet!  I'm askin' you cause you know about these things!

I’m shaken! I wish I had you near me nowooww, oh ohhh oh... I said there’s nooOOoo mistaken’, What I have is reallly love!

• My heart skipped a beat... then I realized that there's at least one other Fiona on campus but hey, you never know, right?
• Why do I feel awkward when I whistle in public?
• How do you tell a good friend that you don't want to room with her next year because you're terrified that never having any time to yourself will drive you insane? Is there anyway to say that and not seem horrible?
• Any one else on campus in need of roommate? Im in a pickle because my friends have a odd number, help!
• is really tired of watching drunk girls being sloppy, trashy, slutty and classless. please get your lives together so you can maintain whatever dignity you might possibly have left.
• I wonder what Eagle Rants would have been like back in 1925...
"Am I alone in thinking that this Scopes Chap isn't entirely mad?"
"It is simply unthinkable that this institution would allow Undergraduates to sully it's halls with their immaturity. They must think that collegiate life is all about 'making whoopie'."
• to all the straight girls with boy cuts, you are all 1000% more attractive and hot.
• Just because people's opinions on the Earth's origins differ from your own doesn't mean you have the right to label them crazy. I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate them calling you crazy for believing otherwise. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
• drunkn egle ranting is the new drunkj tesxting!!
• I thought I could trust you. I didn't realize how wrong I could be.
• @Star Wars purists: represent! This 3d nonsense doesn't count as star wars... The only possible motivation to see the original three is to finally see them on the big screen.... Stay true!!
• I miss the feeling of being wanted. It seems like the only attention I'm able to get from guys now is just physical attention. Meanwhile, when I was in a relationship all of last year and this past semester, people actually had a crush on me. I hate being single.
• Clubs are for GDIs.
• Hello, my name is Tom Riddle.
• Just had a guy that I had a crush on in high school tell me that he wanted to ask me out all senior year... why the f*** are you telling me now?!?!?
• @Be My Valentine,
No, it isn't douchey to say that. And yes, I would really like to be your valentine.
-Interested in You
• I don't know about anyone else, but I don't use the dorm bathroom soap because I'm allergic to it.. I use hand sanitizer after I leave. please don't judge. we're not all slobs.
• I crashed your plane, brothah.
• @future stay at home mom: It's funny how society has become more accepting of stay at home dads than stay at home moms. I bet no one would criticize a man who went to grad school and then stayed home to raise the kids while his wife works.  Don’t give up on your admirable plan. I plan on being a stay at home mom immediately after going to law school. I’m not even planning on taking the bar exam. Plan on getting prego the day after my last final exam ends. Haha
• Remember that time we only got rants once a week?
• You under counted the sassy.
• So many boogers. Sick. :(
• Grad school is a huge waste of money unless you need it for your career. You do realize that everything you learn in grad school you can  probably learn from books available for free at your local library? Don't drop 50k plus just for a self esteem booster.
• actually, some people ARE asleep at 3 am, or at least trying to sleep..

• ..If we dont make the ncaa tournament this year, I may actually cry in public. Because next year we have no chance.
• @ Thinking of transfering: I don't think you're transferring anywhere if you can't spell "transferring" correctly.
• "I just had the most amazing sex of my life. I didn’t even know sex could be done like that." DITTO.
• I'm such a terrible person for still making out with you after you told me you a girlfriend!!!
• I met this really cool girl in the elevator one day and shes all I can think about now......hope she knows

• Girls who lead guys on when they have NO intention of giving them anything: there's people who might actually have intentions.
• Someone in my math class asked the teacher if he could do another example.  The teacher replied: "We've just done every example in the world."
What are we supposed to do with that?
• The bad thing about community bathrooms is that when you're sick and phlegm is in your throat you either have to walk to the bath room each time, or develop a phlegm cup.  Which do you think I did?
• I have yet to meet a person at AU with regular bandaids.  That says a lot about a campus.  They're always rainbow, or toy story...
• We met Saturday night at a party. I cant mention names haha, but Yours starts with an E. Either way, it was great getting to know you. U seem like a kind, down-to-earth girl and id def be interested in hanging out sometime. If u know who I am, and am interested, let me know :) Sincerely, M

• "I know you're having a harder time than you're letting on.  I just wish I could take some of your unhappiness..."
I'm going to believe this is my roommate.  Thank you.  I need that.
• eagle rant editor - i think i know who you are. i also think i know where you live. muahaha.
[Editor’s Note: I am a nomad.]
• I just want to give a shout out to this years batch of Orientation Coordinators. Keep doing a good job and keep looking good while doing it
• @"There’s gotta be some way to find hookups without partying, right?" You'll tell me when you find a way.  Right :)
• I miss acting in high school.  I wish it was something impressive on a resume, so that I could justify devoting time to it in college.  :/  I guess my acting career has to be retired.
[Editor’s Note: You can act if you want to. You can leave your books behind. Cuz your books don’t act and if they don’t act then they’re no books of mine]
• i love alpha sig guys
• A kid from one of my classes, who has never spoken to me before, friend requested me on facebook, and when I sent them a message, didn't respond.  weird.
• RHA general assembly was strange.
• To the hughes hall megaphone troll: I approve!
• I hate it when professor's assign busywork, I have legitimate work for other classes that I keep having to put off because of these assignments.
• I'm not sad or angry, I'm just done. I just can't do it anymore.
• Why isn't The Perch open during the day?? I need some caffeine yet I don't want to brave the arctic weather....
• Lost sucks people.
• N'sync also sucks Backstreet boys were the best boy band ever

Hopeless Crush

You'll thank yourself later. You really will.
• WHY DO I ALWAYS DO THIS. I'm so frustrated. GUYS CONFUSE ME SO MUCH!
• i know who the eagle rants editor is! teeheeeheeheehee. i wonder if he/she knos who i am. :D
• I cannot deal with it anymore. I just want to experiment with the other sex. I want to know what it's like, what it feels like. I am not up to the point of sex, but anything less would be awesome. I have a couple of ideas, as in friends I would feel comfortable with doing so, (like casual makeout or w.e) but I don't think they would want to in exchange. How do I fix/deal with this dilemma ?
• @[Editor’s Note: If I wasn’t a celebrity, would you still be so nice to me?],
Really I just love the occasional N*Sync throwback. Gotta love JT with the terrible frosted tips. Oh the 90's...
• @I started working out recently,
I feel ya. Try focusing on the little changes in your physique and  really hype those up to yourself. I had really flabby arms so when I started working out and finally saw the first indications of a muscular contour, I was super happy and my hard work felt vindicated. You'll get there; just keep swimming!
• that awkward moment when you go down to the mudbox to get food and you forgot that you left your id upstairs....
