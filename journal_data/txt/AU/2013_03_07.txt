Imagine that your school consisted of four twigs and a tin roof. No walls to protect you against the elements or a floor on which you could walk without getting dirt between your toes. 
Imagine you were a child and had to go to school inside a bar, surrounded by empty beer bottles and crowded with kids, some older and some younger. 
It sounds outrageous, right? Well this is life for many students in Honduras. 
Thousands of children have to attend schools similar to the one just mentioned, others have to walk miles to reach the neighboring villages with schools, and others simply don't have the chance to go at all.
In recent years, we have heard about the abundance of problems that plague Honduras: coups, drug trafficking, corruption and poverty. One of the biggest problems is the prevalence of gangs in the lives of young boys and girls. Most of these children are born from a single mothers who work all day for less than a minimum wage, or approximately $150 per month. Due to a lack of proper care, children tend to skip school and instead seek out gang membership to feel as though they belong to a group.
To combat these problems, Students Helping Honduras (SHH) has set out on a mission to build 1,000 schools in rural villages by the year 2020. A few AU students had the opportunity to travel abroad this winter break and help construct some of these schools. These students spent a week mixing cement, shoveling sand and carrying cement blocks. Most importantly they made connections with the children who will study in the schools, and with other volunteers from across the U.S. 
SHH Treasurer Gabriela Christie said that the most valuable lesson she learned was understanding how fortunate she was.

The Board of Elections met Jan. 25 to decide the fate of a proposed referendum to change the organization of the Student Government, which would be called the Student Association. 
SG Comptroller Joe St.Marie and the Students Association Campaign were brought up on charges of campaign violations, which included campaigning and seeking endorsements on Jan. 20, before campaigning was to begin. The BOE found the campaign not guilty of the violations. BOE members resigned.
This should be old news right? We're in March. The referendum failed. We should be moving on to bigger and brighter things. Wrong.
When I heard this story about the "Show Trial" and the Student Association referendum, I applied for kicks and giggles. When I applied, I had no idea how screwed up SG was becoming. There was a lull in activity within SG after the referendum election, sort of like the calm before the storm.
The Senate and BOE have recently been locking horns when it comes to election policy and regulations. SG delayed a decision on the Election Policy Book, which was supposedly submitted by the BOE on Feb. 13 and received by the Senate on Feb. 16, 24 hours before the Senate was to meet for their weekly meeting. Why such a huge gap in time? 
The Senate later came to a decision on Feb. 24, a week after their Feb. 17 meeting. They made considerable changes to the Policy Book. Being a BOE member, I saw these changes firsthand. The considerable changes to the Policy Book included taking out regulations, which, in my opinion, were necessary. If we, the BOE, allowed this, we'd be letting corruption run rampant. 
Amongst the Senates omissions: 
1. Policies that required campaigns to report the amount of money they were spending toward a campaign, either through an SG issued purchase card or receipts of purchases.
2. Polices that prohibited current members of SG (executives, Judicial Board/BOE members, senators, etc.) from campaigning for candidates other than themselves. However, they would still be allowed to endorse.
The removal of those policies smells of corruption. There are limits on how much money you are allowed to spend on a campaign. How are we to know if you're abiding by those limits? We're not running super PACs here. This isn't the U.S. Government. At the same time, we pay into the SG through our Student Activities fee included in tuition costs. How am I to know what my money is actually being used on?
The BOE and I voted on the Standing Election Policy Book and decided to put those regulations back in, albeit not unanimously. However, since the needed super majority was met, we passed the changes and would have submitted it back to the Senate for Review... but that wasn't meant to be. 
The SG Senate is already livid with us. Amongst the bills and policies passed at that Feb. 24 meeting was a bill called the "Freer and Fairer Elections" bill, which was supposed to dissolve the current form of the Board of Elections and replace it with a new set of bylaws and organization. The dissolution of the BOE would take place next year. This was passed in the Senate. 
On March 3, the bill which was already passed on Feb. 24, was reintroduced with one change: that the BOE be dissolved effective immediately.
So now I've been laid off by the SG for doing my job. What should I do now? What should we do to better the student body? This bureaucracy is inhibiting real change and real student advocacy. I almost wish the Student Association passed, albeit I'm not thrilled at the fact that the campaign received a slap on the wrist for an obvious election violation.

You gotta hand it to the Republicans: they’re the best politicians in town.
They figured out how to manufacture leverage — and use it, too. They’ve found their rhythm, and they sure are grooving to the beat of their own drum.
See, the plan goes something like this:
Allow President Ronald Reagan to quadruple the national debt, largely by increasing defense spending (against the USSR, which was crumbling from within).	
Let President George H. W. Bush continue such disastrous economic policies, and then turn tail and run from him when he suggests something as heinous as raising taxes to pay for his exploits (like that undeclared war).
And then, make the debt the defining issue of the 1992 campaign and, when the other side wins, pounce on the new Democratic president by saying he’s not doing enough to reduce the deficit.
Furthermore, use the deficit as a wedge issue to take back the House in the midterm elections, and force a series of budget cuts that send the president off-message and prevent him from investing in health care, education, science and technology.
Sound familiar? That’s because it is.	
History does in fact repeat itself, and the GOP response to President Barack Obama’s budget proposals is proof of this.
The GOP said nothing — nothing! — when President George W. Bush fought two wars, signed into law a costly expansion of Medicare and cut taxes all at the same time. He doubled the national debt in eight years.
But once Obama got elected, the debt was suddenly the biggest issue we had to address. Some even took to calling it a “national security issue” (kind of like how the USSR was a national security issue in 1984).
The best line yet was Gov. Mitt Romney’s “road to Greece” gimmick.
It is pathetically ironic that the very policies that put Greece “on the road to Greece” — not paying their debts (read: “not passing the debt ceiling”) and austerity (read: “drastic budget cuts”) – are the same policies Republicans are advocating.
In 2010, America elected a gang of lawmakers who don’t understand basic economics. Americans tricked into voting for these people on the basis of a mythical “national security issue.”
And these people are working against their voters’ interests, most recently by failing to stop the sequester.
For all their talk of “job creators” and the need for more businessmen in government, Republicans don’t seem to understand that a CEO can’t provide jobs for his employees if consumers don’t have the money to buy his product or houses to put it in.
Indeed, in a recession, the government is the single most important spender and investor, because it is the only entity that can spend and invest. It did so in 1932, and has done so in every recession ever since.       	
In reality, Republicans in Congress don’t want to solve our debt “problem.” Why would they want to give up prime leverage? If history is any guide, they’ll want to use it again when the next unassuming (Democrat) schmuck strolls down Pennsylvania Avenue.        
The sequester, which Macroeconomic Advisers LLC estimates will ultimately cost 700,000 American jobs, is just the latest riff in the GOP’s tempo.        
It provided the GOP’s desired endgame: instead of talking about how to invest in our children’s future or repair our disintegrating infrastructure, we’re talking about which programs – like Social Security and Medicare – can be cut.        
So, the next time you enter the voting booth, remember that it’s not the deficit. It’s a game of political musical chairs, and it matters a helluva lot who sits in the chairs and who plays the music.

Sometimes college students can be creative in their pranks. Sometimes they are funny. Sometimes they are so clever that even the faculty laughs along. 
Stealing the bust of Tolstoy was not one of these pranks.
Sculptor Gregory Pototsky generously donated the bust of Leo Tolstoy to the University. It was a gift from the sculptor to signify AU’s commitment to strengthening American-Russian relations.
Although this may not be the most notable aspect of campus to many students, there will be repercussions of this theft.
The vandalism of the Tolstoy bust makes the entire AU community look disrespectful and immature. There is a line between being funny or political and vandalizing artwork. Public art is a great addition to the campus community, and incidents such as this will deter future artists from donating to AU.
But unnecessary vandalism goes a step further at AU. With the new budget, more of AU’s revenue will come from philanthropic sources. We are becoming more dependant on alumni donations. Most alumni donations come with a plaque or statue commemorating their donation. 
If AU students give off the impression that their donations will be vandalized, it will significantly deter future donations.
Our money is on the line here. We have one of the smallest endowments in the country, so we should not jeopardize any philanthropy money for petty crime.
It should also concern students that the bust was able to be stolen so easily. It could not have been quick or simple to get the bust off of the concrete and carry it away from campus. Public Safety should be keeping a close enough watch on our campus that they would notice an entire statue being destroyed.
Campus security has been a growing concern over the year, and this incident should not make anyone feel any safer.
Ultimately, those who committed this vandalism need to grow up. The majority of AU students appreciate the donations and art that’s displayed on campus. Most AU students want alumni and fascinating members of the worldwide community to contribute to our campus in any way possible. This event has the potential to severely hurt the entire AU community because of a few, which is unfair.
The vandalism was cruel and petty. AU students are better than this, and we all need to show it.  ? E

March 3 marked an important day for Kenyans. It was the day of the anxiously anticipated and crucial presidential election. This was Kenya’s first presidential vote since 2007, when evidence of vote rigging set off ethnic clashes and violence that killed over 1,000 people across the country.
I visited Kenya for the first time this January. While the elections were only two months away, there was a tension present in Nairobi. The bustling city was covered with presidential propaganda — billboards, posters and graffiti everywhere. 
At the embassy, where my father works, anticipation was also high. Not only was the outcome of the elections crucial for future U.S.–Kenya relations, but the threat of violence was also a concern among American diplomats. 
Throughout our trip, my father often asked Kenyans what their opinion was about the upcoming election. While emotions ranged from hopeful to worried, the one thing they all shared in common was a need to vote. 
One taxi driver told us that he would need to take at least three matatus (privately owned and crowded minibuses) to get to his voting location, while others would venture home to their own polling place  outside of downtown Nairobi to cast their ballots. 
When he asked me if everyone in the U.S. voted during the re-election, he was shocked when I told him many American’s don’t vote. He joked that Kenya was more of a democracy than the U.S. 
That got me thinking: is there truth behind that statement?
Kenya’s government is far from perfect. Uhuru Kenyatta has held a commanding lead of 40 percent to 55 percent over the second-place candidate, Raila Odinga, Kenya’s prime minister. Kenyatta has been accused by the International Criminal Court of financing death squads. 
However, Kenya is one of the most industrialized and democratic countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and this year’s election is the most complicated in its history. New positions have been created to change the winner-takes-all nature of Kenyan politics. These include governorships, Senate seats and even female county representatives. 
While many Kenyans still vote along ethnic lines, civic groups have tried to make this election about issues, integrity and plans, not ethnic groups. 
While their democracy and government may not be perfect, the election has impressed me and demonstrated a true desire for peace, stability and democracy. 
Like in the U.S., Kenyans are not required to vote. However, voter turnout on March 4 was tremendous, starting hours before dawn with lines of voters stretching nearly a mile long. In Nairobi’s Kibera slum, people waited nine hours on their feet to cast their vote. 
Voting was peaceful, albeit for some isolated violence on the coast but nothing compared to the riots of 2007.
While Kenya still has a long way to go in terms of ethnic tension and government, we Americans, who complain when we have to wait in line to vote and often don’t take advantage of the privilege we have, can learn from Kenyan citizens. 
The right to vote is one of the most sacred we have. While people flooding the polls in Kenya might not mean that this particular election is corruption-free and perfect, it shows that they want change and to take part of their government. Can we say the same here, where a color divide led many to not even vote? 
Only time will tell what Kenya’s fate is, or if the predicted victory of Kenyatta will spark violence. However, Kenyans are headed in the right direction, and their determination will take them far. 
Let’s hope Americans will one day also have the determination to wait in line, want to vote and celebrate a privilege many do not have.

The Student Government Undergraduate Senate unanimously voted to support transgender students as the University re-negotiates its health insurance plan with GM-Southwest, AU’s student health insurance provider. 
Class of 2013 Sen. Sarah McBride introduced the bill for a vote on March 3. The main purpose of the bill was to urge the University to cover medicine that would help a student transition to his or her preferred gender identity, such as surgery, which is currently excluded from the University’s health care plan, she said.
AU’s current student coverage shows a level of discrimination against transgender students that is present in many current insurance plans, McBride said. For example, the plan excludes surgery on the basis that it is an elective and cosmetic procedure, she said.
“It suggests that being trans is a choice and therefore surgery is an elective thing,” McBride said.
As a transgender student, McBride has a personal connection to the legislation.
“I would have chosen to go into the [AU] student health insurance pool this year had they included the transitional care,” McBride said.
Class of 2015 Sen. Patrick Kelly co-sponsored the bill and commended the push for LGBT advocacy.
“It’s also within the principles of AU,” Kelly said. “We pride ourselves on being an inclusive school.”

AU aims to release a draft of its tobacco-free policy by the end of the month, according to Assistant Vice President and Dean of Students Robert Hradsky.
While Hradsky confirmed the University still hopes to ban all forms of tobacco by Aug. 1, the implementation date will probably be Aug. 15, according to Student Government President Emily Yu.
“We’ve been benchmarking other schools and their specific policies,” Hradsky said. “We have been trying to address larger picture questions, so that’s been the focus to date.”
A March 1 memo sent to all members of the AU community asked for feedback on several questions about the specifics of the policy.  The questions included whether possession of tobacco products would be prohibited, how the policy would be enforced and how violations would be punished.
Hradsky and Assistant Vice President of Human Resources Beth Muha are co-chairs of the Tobacco-Free Project Team. The faculty members and undergraduate representative on the team are responsible for writing the policy, with subcommittees focusing on communications, enforcement, facilities and grounds and health and wellness.
AU first decided to go tobacco-free in November, but student leaders such as Yu, Residence Hall Association President Fiona Erickson and Graduate Leadership Council Executive Chair Lauren Lane were skeptical, The Eagle previously reported. They argued that a University-wide ban was the wrong approach.
“Not only will the ban increase the risks to students’ personal safety at off-campus locations, but their forced migration will result in larger implications regarding the university’s reputation in the community,” the three officials said in a co-written letter at the time of the ban.
Yu said her views have changed slightly since the letter. The SG president is still in favor of designated smoking areas and “reasonable” enforcement of that policy, but said that she was more open to the policy after working with other members of the project team and further research on the subject.
“The university has already announced its intention to move forward with AU becoming tobacco-free,” Yu said in an e-mail. “At this point in process, I am dedicated to bringing student voices to the project team.”
