“I, Daniel Blake” is a moving look at the quagmire that is the welfare system, breaking through the callousness of glib terms like “welfare queen.” There is no crown or glory in battling an amorphic bureaucracy for something as basic as one’s right to exist and live.
 
British comedian Dave Johns stars as Daniel Blake, a 59-year-old carpenter from Newcastle, UK, who is seeking public assistance while recovering from a major heart attack. He must navigate a byzantine system of two hour customer disservice calls, forms, inane questions and resume workshops. Though his many encounters with the public servants (the irony of this term will not escape you after this movie) are nothing short of tragic, Daniel still manages to inject comedy─for example, when asked if he is able to relay simple information in a conversation, he wryly responds to the clerk, “Clearly not, based on the questions you are asking me.” When his benefits are denied, he is told he has to return back to work even though his physician does not allow it. So, he is forced to keep applying to jobs he can’t actually take, while simply awaiting his right to appeal. The administration keeps promising him a call from an omnipotent “decision-maker”─again, the nomenclature is quite apt. 
 
Subjected to humiliation, including having to sell all of his furniture, so he would have something to eat, and walking around in his house with a blanket wrapped around him because it is so cold, Daniel somehow still manages to hold on to his decency. He starts helping Katie (Hayley Squires) and her two kids who are in similar dire straits. Katie is in a state of ceaseless worry, crying in hiding when her kids go to sleep at night. In one of the most poignant scenes in the film, she tears open a can of beans and scoops them into her mouth with her hands at the government food pantry because she has been starving herself to give to her kids. She then keeps apologizing, as though the degradation she has been subjected to is somehow her fault.
 
Director Ken Loach keeps “I, Daniel Blake” light on the polemics, instead allowing the powerful performances of Johns and Squires to shine. The subject matter is heavy, but a droll sense of humor prevents the film from being onerous and bleak. When Dan draws graffiti on the welfare administration building, writing, “I, Daniel Blake, would like an appeal date before I starve and change the shite music on the phones,” he is commenting on the very absurdity of a system that refuses to recognize his humanity. The graffiti is his selfhood writ large. His empty flat, with just a phone sitting on the floor, awaiting a decision-maker Godot who never comes, is a poignant take on the precarity that is the daily life of so many.

After a series of poorly reviewed movies for the DC Extended Universe, largely helmed by director Zach Snyder, actress and soon-to-be mega-star Gal Gadot and director Patty Jenkins pick up the slack with “Wonder Woman.”
Although Gadot’s Wonder Woman appeared in Snyder’s “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” and is set to appear in this fall’s “Justice League” film, this is the first stand-alone film for the beloved comic character. The film tells the origin story of the Amazonian warrior, born to Greek God, Zeus and Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons from Greek mythology. It follows Wonder Woman and World War I spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) as they seek to end the war in Europe, which threatens to kill millions.
While many superhero movies stumble when telling the hero’s origin, “Wonder Woman” excels by cutting right to the chase and creating an immediate emotional connection with the characters and a compelling, coherent story from the jump. Pine and Gadot’s chemistry is a treat to watch, even if the jokes regarding Wonder Woman’s sexual innocence are a little overdone.
The story is a typical coming of age tale, but the script is largely sharp and witty enough for it to feel fresh, at least in the moment. When lines fall flat, or the scene feels like a retread of another superhero flick, the stars on screen are charismatic enough to carry the moment nearly every time. 
Jenkin’s take on big action is not so far removed from Zach Snyder’s, which is to say over the top damage, CGI heavy and flashy, but cinematographer Matthew Jensen is able to create stunning, engaging chaos on screen. Seeing Wonder Woman fearlessly charge into a bullet storm or throw around Ares, the Greek god of war, is remarkably cool from a gender politics standpoint, but it is also done in a way that pulls you into the shot.
The supporting cast, consisting of Trevor’s secretary, Etta Candy (Lucy Davis), as comic support and a cast of military misfits, is charming and given good material to work with. However, the character of Chief (Eugene Brave Rock) is a black mark on an otherwise progressive film. Chief serves as evidence of a much larger race issue in Hollywood, which frequently reduces minorities, especially Native Americans, to caricatures.
“Wonder Woman” is a brave, energetic and greatly enjoyable popcorn movie that is as uplifting as it is downright badass. It isn’t trying to reinvent the wheel, and it didn’t have to in order to separate itself from the vast majority of other superhero movies of the last decade. Lynda Carter, who played the original Wonder Woman on TV in the 1970s, has every reason to be proud of the captivating, enigmatic Gadot and her stellar director, and the giant leap for female lead action movies this movie took.
