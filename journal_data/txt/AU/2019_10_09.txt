The House of Representatives held a hearing on Sept. 19 that AU students attended to discuss the Washington D.C. Admission Act. The bill, which was introduced by Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) in January, would make Washington D.C. the 51st state and give more than 700,000 residents voting representation in Congress.
D.C. should become the 51st state in the United States of America for innumerable reasons. As of right now, D.C. is a federal district that Congress has direct jurisdiction over. If D.C. does become a state, it would be granted votes in Congress. Currently, D.C. residents pay federal taxes, yet only have a non-voting membership in the House of Representatives. Making D.C. a state would guarantee taxation and representation.
Even though D.C. has more residents than most states, it is still considered a federal district. As of 2019, Vermont has a population of approximately 627,180 people and Wyoming has around 572,381 people, while D.C. has a population that totals around 711,571. Even though D.C. has a population larger than these two states, its residents do not receive the same voting rights that their citizens have. Every citizen deserves the right to vote; however, some citizens are not given the same rights as others.
D.C. residents pay high prices to live and work for living in a highly-populated urban area. According to the National Association of Realtors, the median price of a single-family home in D.C. is $417,400, and real estate prices only increase every year. Residents who pay this much money deserve the right to vote for representatives that will consider costs of living in a city when creating legislation. 
Furthermore, D.C. is constantly changing. Things like protests, political announcements that make the press come running and public transportation problems can easily disrupt D.C. residents’ daily schedules. Sometimes residents have little warning about these events which impact their daily life so greatly. D.C. residents deserve the chance to get a say in how things are run in their neighborhoods.
I do acknowledge some of the opposing side’s standpoints on this issue. It may be costly to run prisons and courts, but isn’t it worth it to be counted as a true equal to other citizens of our country? People in bordering states, like Maryland and Virginia, get representation for their ideals. Someone living 10 minutes away might have the right to vote and yet a D.C. citizen does not.
Another reason that some claim D.C. should not be a state is because the proposed state name does not appeal to them. If D.C. becomes a state, it would be called the “State of Washington, D.C.” However, D.C. would no longer stand for “District of Columbia.” Instead, it would stand for “Douglass Commonwealth.” If opponents try to fight against D.C. statehood  because of the name it would bear, then their argument is, simply stated, weak. 
“We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal.” Those words, while it may surprise some, were not written by Lin Manuel Miranda in “Hamilton,” but by Thomas Jefferson, 243 years ago in the Declaration of Independence. Today it seems that D.C. residents do not get the same equal treatment that is written at the core of our nation’s history. D.C. should become a state not just because of its involvement in political matters, population size or high living prices, but because of how important it is to the nation. The citizens of our nation’s capital should be represented in government and have a constitutional right to vote.

American University is a leader in the field of international service. The nationally-ranked program is sought after by many students and offers a plethora of unique opportunities that anyone interested in the subject would be lucky to have access to. Still, as ahead of the curve as AU loves to emphasize that it is, significant work is yet to be done on how our students learn about countries other than their own. 
As a CLEG major, my interactions with SIS are limited to getting work done at the Dav and one or two required classes that fit under the discipline of international service. Still, after taking one of those courses, it is clear to me that the way we teach and talk about non-Western nations is condescending and a disservice to the regions in question. 
Students of color, like myself, are in a unique position to bring something new to the discussion of other nations. My background specifically gives me a comprehensive understanding of how India works beyond what’s on paper, and allows me to juxtapose that with my upbringing in the United States. It is an incredible resource to have, especially when it comes time to study that region specifically. Still, my experience with that aspect of the course was overwhelmingly negative. 
Sitting in a room that’s almost entirely full of white people, I can understand the impulse to not pick words carefully. However, any adverse suggestions, no matter how well-veiled, nuanced or unintentional, are destructive. Any off-hand implication that another country might be primitive and somehow wrong in their politics is incredibly reckless. These implications grow to be established attitudes students have towards other regions in the world, attitudes that are born of mindless and mostly negative nuance. 
Our perspective of the rest of the world is ingrained in our upbringing, and even as educated adults, it is hard to separate a deeply developed perspective from objectivity. This results in people familiar with the Western experience treating the governments of other nations as primitive, uneducated and sometimes even wrong. I don’t doubt that this treatment is unconscious, but that is even more of a reason to diversify the body of individuals that teach  students about incredibly complicated region-specific issues. 
Diversity is a constant goal to strive towards in any institution; however, it is essential in international studies. In order to accurately communicate the nuances involved in the study of other nations, how they interact with each other and how that affects our own, academia needs diversity. Yes, it is a difficult task to create a faculty made up of members of the nations they teach, but it is crucial to the authentic representation of the politics and cultures of these nations. Politics is not just what’s written in the governing documents of countries; it is the everyday application of those documents, something that can only be fully understood by experiencing it. 
The notion that other nations are wrong and ours is right is dangerous, no matter how casually it is implied. This attitude sends students out into the world thinking they have the tools to save nations and create a Western, one size fits all solution to a region-specific problem. Irrespective of whether the nation is developing or developed, teaching from the baseline of America’s “correctness” is endlessly harmful and taints the noble endeavor of studying to be an international servant.

American University and its students love to talk about their internships, and it’s hard to blame them. Given the rigorous application process and the intense competition, securing one of those coveted “Hillternships” is definitely something to take pride in. 
But there’s a success-driven type of culture at AU, one that likely stems from the political nature of D.C. As a result, students feel compelled to take on responsibilities they cannot handle and start measuring their worth based on the amount of internships they have had. This campus-wide obsession with success hides the mental toll it takes on students and ignores the fact that some students simply cannot manage an internship on top of all their other work. 
There’s an omnipresent expectation on students to have as many internships as quickly as possible. This starts even before college; I’ve had high school juniors ask me about interning their first semester at college. Students around campus compare their internships and stress of  fitting in homework, class and sleep alongside it; all too often, something important falls by the wayside. The price of an internship simply might not be worth it for some students, but the culture and mentality that the school has created around internships make them feel it is necessary. 
While there are undoubtedly plenty of students who can manage adding an internship to their workload, there are plenty of other students who cannot. With seemingly everything around them pushing them into an internship as early as their sophomore year, those students who can’t handle it might end up struggling through one anyway. When we’re told to achieve in class, maintain a high GPA, complete all our homework on time, join a minimum of two campus organizations and hold down a 20-hour per week internship, other equally as vital aspects of college go ignored. 
Furthermore, internships simply aren’t a financial possibility for every student, as some need a paying job to afford the expenses of college life. Many (if not most) internships, especially those on Capitol Hill or other government entities, are unpaid, which isn’t feasible for everyone. Lower-income students need a job that actually pays in order to afford the many costs of being at college such as tuition, meals and rent. College is expensive, and not just because of the rising costs of tuition. Students also need to eat, receive healthcare and pay for class materials. In many cases, an admirable yet unpaid internship may need to be bypassed for a paying job. The obsession surrounding an internship also seemingly negates the hard work and time that goes into these other jobs; as someone who has worked in retail, I can attest that it is not at all easy, and shouldn’t be held in a lower regard. 
Another issue that comes up at colleges with such an intense intern culture is that  not everyone is in the right mental or emotional place to balance an internship on top of everything else. Many AU students deal with mental illness, even those that don’t experience immense amounts of stress from schoolwork. The added pressure of finding an internship doesn’t help and makes students feel like they need one even if they mentally cannot handle it. 
The burden shouldn’t be placed on students to solve this. It’s hard for them to give up something when their environment is telling them to do the opposite. Telling them to “just be less stressed” isn’t going to solve much at all. The school itself needs to be more aware of the messages it sends regarding the culture of over-achieving. 
For the sake of its students, AU needs to strike a balance between encouraging students to get work  experience and recognizing that multiple internships aren’t going to be a possibility for everyone, even though everyone really does love to brag about those “Hillternships.”

AU students rally in front of the Capitol Building during the D.C. Climate Strike on Sept. 20. 
Students from the new Sunrise Movement hub at AU joined thousands of protesters at the D.C. Climate Strike in front of the Capitol Building on Sept. 20, demanding action against climate change as part of the largest worldwide climate protest in history. 
The group of six Sunrise activists from AU gathered in John Marshall Park that morning, where they rallied with other activists for half an hour before marching to the Capitol Building. Once there, the AU hub sat on a wall overlooking the rally, holding a massive yellow sign emblazoned with the Sunrise Movement’s primary goal: “GREEN NEW DEAL.”
“I think that with an issue like this, everybody has to make sacrifices,” said Louisa Keyani, the outreach coordinator for Sunrise’s AU hub. “I skipped two classes to come today. But all I would ask is that you look at what's happening … to our planet, and consider what's more important, missing a class or the future of humanity.”
Tyler Massias, the Sunrise hub’s chief coordinator at AU, said that he hopes that the energy and activism presented at the strike isn’t just a one-day event. 
“I’m really proud right now because I’m sitting right beside some of the best AU students on the planet,” Massias said. “That really says a lot, especially when we want to talk about how politically active our campus is – this goes to show that.”
The Sunrise Movement is a national organization made up of young people with the goal of stopping climate change and electing leaders to support climate legislation, specifically the Green New Deal, in Congress. The organization is built around “hubs” in various cities, towns and schools across the U.S. that serve as rallying points for the larger movement. 
The AU group, which is the first of its kind at a college in D.C. and the second collegiate Sunrise hub nationwide, was formed over the summer by Massias, Keyani and Tasneem Osman.  
Keyani said that in the time since the hub was  founded over the summer, engagement over social media has been especially successful. Approximately 40 students are now on their mailing list, and a dozen of them attended the pre-strike meeting earlier in the week. 
One major point of discussion among the three organizers, they said, has been whether to file for official club status at the University. With filing comes financial benefits from the AU Club Council, but this comes at the cost of more oversight from the University. 
So far, the Sunrise Movement has seen success with grassroots fundraising, Keyani said, and is leaning toward an unofficial status at AU. 
As he stared out at the protesting crowd, Massias expressed his optimism about the impact of the strike. 
“I think everyone's bringing really good energy,” he said. “They're really enthusiastic, and they're really passionate. And that's just what we need to really enact some kind of change right here on Capitol Hill.”

Black Welcome Week: Mentorship Mixer 
AU’s first annual Black Welcome Week was held Sept. 9 through 15 and was co-sponsored by more than 10 black clubs and organizations on campus. 
The week was designed to strengthen and develop unity in the black community on campus, with events ranging from a professional student and faculty mixer, to a trip to the National Museum of African American History and Culture and an open mic night. 
AU juniors Kyle Bardell and Fatmata Kamara, who founded Black Welcome Week, said the idea came up during a “late-night MGC rant session.” All of the planning and coordinating took place over the summer in order to be ready for the beginning of the fall semester. 
“We wanted to showcase various parts of the black community on campus for freshmen while also allowing a sort of reunion for the current students,” said Bardell. “We picked these events, for we believed they displayed major parts of the community.”
The founders hope that Black Welcome Week will continue to be a way to unite the community at the start of each semester and welcome freshmen. 
Students say the collaboration that brought Black Welcome Week together made the week possible and will also serve as a jumping-off point for creating a more connected community.
“What's beautiful about it is that all 16 black student organizations will be participating in the week's events in one capacity or another,” said Sarah Duval, the founder of AU’s Black Pre-Professional Society. 
Kamara said that she's proud that the week was entirely student-led, and that almost all of the planning was run by black students. 
“It’s something for the community by the community,” said Kamara. “Who else would know the things that black students want besides black students?”
Duval said that the space Black Welcome Week provided allowed students to thrive in a comfortable space and be their “authentic selves and break bread with one another.” 
Kamara said that she hopes the week expands in the future and becomes a way for the community to come together and support each other. 
“We're only 9 percent [of the student body], so we really should support each other as much as we can,” Kamara said. “It's better for us to support each other and be there for each other.”
