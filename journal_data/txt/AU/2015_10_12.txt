Texas-raised Alan Palomo—better known as Neon Indian—will perform at the 9:30 Club on Oct. 13. The artist is set to release his latest album “VEGA INTL. Night School” on Oct. 16, Palomo’s first recording since his 2011 release of “Era Extraña.”
You can already listen to the singles “Slumlord,” “Annie” and “The Glitzy Hive” from “VEGA INTL Night School.” A music video for “Slumlord” will also be released soon, according to  pictures posted on Palomo’s Instagram account.

On the upcoming album, Palomo reverts back to the glitchy tendencies and electro-pop sensibilities that first gave Neon Indian its cosmic quality in “Psychic Chasms” (2009). While Palomo is moving away from the humorous elements of “Psychic Chasms,” which included track names like “Laughing Gas,” “Should Have Taken Acid With You” and “Terminally Chill,” his new album still keeps things light-hearted and merry.

The newest singles from “VEGA INTL. Night School” make listeners feel life they are simultaneously in paradise and living in a modern version of Miami Vice. Much more energetic than “Psychic Chasms,” yet unshakably beachy, the latest album assures that concert-goers will have a kinetic and unique experience at the 9:30 Club on Oct. 13.
New Zealand native and New York-based vocalist Tamaryn will open for Neon Indian. Tamaryn will showcase her latest album, “Cranekiss,” released August 2015.

USA Today ranked AU’s School of Communication among the top journalism schools in the nation earlier this year.
SOC was ranked tenth behind schools including New York University, the University of Southern California and Emerson College, which took the top spot. USA Today worked with College Factual to establish with the rankings, using information such as graduates’ salaries, the percentage of students at the school studying the major, program accreditation and measures of overall college quality.
“These rankings are a pretty big deal,” Professor John Watson, the director of the Journalism division and professor in SOC, said. “When people look at colleges they might want to attend, they want to go to schools that rank high. People rely on them to choose.” 
Watson said that a top 10 ranking is appropriately representative of the quality an AU education in journalism provides.
“This place [AU] has been good for a long time, but people are only suddenly realizing it,” Watson said. “AU has been called one of the best kept secrets in the country.”
Washington D.C. is the news capital of the world and the city provides journalism students with opportunities they wouldn’t get anywhere else, Watson said.
Jess Anderson, a senior studying journalism in SOC and CLEG in the School of Public Affairs, said she is proud to participate in such a high-quality program.
“Journalism is changing, and it’s great to be at a school that’s trying to keep up,”Anderson said.
Anderson said that she took several journalism classes in high school and knew she wanted to pursue reporting as a career. When she was applying to college, AU’s distinction as one of two universities in the district with an accredited journalism program attracted Anderson.
“Journalism is an active major, and you learn more and get better by actually doing it,” Anderson said. “For someone like me with experience, the remedial classes like Understanding Media and Visual Literacy covered things that I already knew, but once you get to the later classes, you’re out in the field practicing for the future.”
Watson said that the journalism division has tried to move the core journalism classes further up in the curriculum to give students like Anderson early opportunities to put their passion for news into practice.
Going forward, Watson hopes to continue SOC’s success by closely monitoring the changes that occur to the field of journalism.
“We give students access to new technology before it’s standardized in the industry, so they’re already comfortable working with it when they graduate,” Watson said. “The thing that makes [the division of journalism] great is that we are agile; we meet the needs of the field right away.”

In an effort to simplify the registration process for upcoming semesters, the Office of the University Registrar launched the University’s new registration system, Student Planning, on Oct. 5.
Student Planning will integrate previously separate tasks, including degree planning and course registration, into one online system combined with Eagle Finance, the University’s student finance self-service system.
“It’s like night and day,” School of Public Affairs and College of Arts and Sciences junior Matthew Wilson said. “With the last system, you were self-reliant in piecing together your schedule. This new way is much more visual. I know a lot of students in the past have resorted to using online schedules and making an excel sheet. AU didn’t facilitate any of that until this new system came out.”
Student Planning, available via the Eagle Service link in the Academic tab of the MyAU portal, is the product of feedback from administrators and academic advisors. The system allows students to drag and drop courses, filtered by day of the week, professor, location and time of day, into a proposed schedule.
Students can also track progress toward achieving their degrees by building a four-year degree plan without leaving the module. On registration day in early November, students will be able to click “Register Now” to register for classes based on their proposed schedule for the upcoming semester.
According to University Registrar Doug McKenna, one change to course registration is that students will be given a set registration “start time” during the day instead of the old midnight registration format.
“Previously, registration kicked off at midnight so there was nobody around for students to ask questions,” McKenna said. “One of the main recommendations was to move registration to the daytime so that students gained access to the system in their initial registration time while people are around.”
The registrar’s office will be briefing faculty on the changes in “start times” for the new registration process on Student Planning. For students in class during their designated registration time, McKenna recommends communicating with professors about stepping out of class to register. His office has also made an effort to make Student Planning accessible on mobile interfaces such as smartphones and tablets.
“Students can register at any point after their registration appointment time begins. The numbers of students who gain access in each 30-minute window is very limited, so even a delay of an hour or more will not significantly disadvantage a student who is attempting to register into specific sections. ” McKenna said. “Having a schedule planned and being able to click ‘Register Now’ will be very helpful as well.
Launching Student Planning has been a multi-year project. Provost Scott Bass approved the creation of a Student Planning Project Team in March 2013 based on the recommendation of a task force composed of approximately 25 administrators from different departments, though it did not include students, McKenna said.
The registrar’s office has released tutorials online to help students transition to the new system prior to registering for classes.
“I'd recommend that students who have questions about their course schedules that they go ahead and start scheduling appointments,” CAS Director of Advising Marla Boren said. “Read the information that the office of the registrar has sent out, do the tutorials, and if there are questions to check in with their advisors.”
Students are able to begin planning their schedules now and will be able to officially register for classes using Student Planning in early November.
