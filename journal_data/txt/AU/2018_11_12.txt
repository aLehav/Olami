In a recent investigation, the New York Times published a photo of an emaciated young girl, Amal Hussain, suffering from starvation in Yemen. Her picture and subsequent death provoked an emotional and empathetic response from readers and became another symbol of civilian suffering in war-torn Yemen. The picture is unfortunately just one of many disturbing images from a war between Saudi Arabia and rebel groups who are fighting for control over land and political power in Yemen. 
After three years, the intense fighting in Yemen has produced no clear winner despite extensive and devastating Saudi bombing campaigns across the country. While there has not been a winner, there has been a clear and consistent loser: civilians like Amal. Civilians have borne the brunt of the attacks aimed at rebel groups. 
With attacks on marketplaces, hospitals, funerals, weddings and schools, there are few safe places left for civilians. Even worse, bombs have destroyed infrastructure that civilians depend on for necessities like food, water and sanitation. A recent offensive on the port city, through which an estimated 80 percent of food and water are imported, worsened a humanitarian crisis in which the UN estimates nearly fourteen million people live on the brink of famine. The destruction of water sanitation sites has also contributed to a preventable cholera outbreak that has infected an estimated one million people. 
Saudi Arabia has been sharply criticized for its indiscriminate attacks and indifference to mass civilian suffering. However, Saudi Arabia’s bombing campaigns have also been enabled and legitimized by a close partnership with our own government. The U.S. has been intimately involved as an advisor, partner and weapons dealer. 
We have provided extensive support for the bombing campaigns, including billion-dollar weapons deals that supply bombs like the one that was dropped on a school bus in August. U.S. officials state that they want peace in Yemen, but these statements will ring hollow if the bombs dropped indiscriminately on civilians continue to be #MadeinAmerica. 
This kind of partnership forms part of a dark pattern in the history of U.S. foreign policy. Similar weapons deals and partnerships have enabled mass civilian suffering in the past and have even provided the weapons for genocide in countries like Pakistan and Guatemala. In each past case, coalitions of concerned journalists, activists and members of Congress have tried to end U.S. weapons deals before it was too late. Without engaged support and attention from the American public, however, these movements have frequently fallen short.
The recent murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the images of starvation in Yemen have led to a similar challenge to our partnership with Saudi Arabia this past month. A bill in Congress to stop the deals fell just short of ending the the weapons deals last year, but a similar bill is scheduled to be voted on in November. 
However, history has shown us that momentary shock and condemnation are not enough to end these kinds of military partnerships, and even the best leaders cannot end them without the engaged support of the public. The crisis in Yemen is once again testing American citizens’ ability to hold our government accountable and live up to the best of American values. We must do better this time for the people of Yemen. 
It is too late to save Amal Hussain, but there are countless other civilians whose lives hang in the balance. As Americans, we can and must do our part by calling our elected officials and urging them to do everything in their power to end this deadly partnership.

Students sit in SIS to watch election results in November 2016. 
The following piece is satire and should not be misconstrued for actual reporting. Any resemblance to a student, staff or faculty member is coincidental.
On Tuesday night, students at AU flocked to locations all over campus to watch the results of midterm elections, including the residence halls, SIS, and Kerwin Hall. They seemed to be everywhere, except for the quad, where there was a free full buffet that pretty much went completely unnoticed.
The University wanted to surprise students with this buffet as a celebration for all of their hard work participating in the past election cycle, but unfortunately not a single student showed up. According to a statement from the University, administrators believed the buffet would go over well with students.
“We recognized how involved AU students were this past election, and we know that there’s nothing that college students love more than free food,” said a spokesperson.“So we thought it would be the perfect gift to show our appreciation for the most politically active student body in America.”
An employee from Greg’s Catering said, “It was the weirdest thing. It felt like the campus was completely empty, but I could hear cheers from different buildings on campus. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Samara Meza, a freshman who was watching from her lounge in Letts Hall, was simply too locked into the CNN coverage. 
“I had no idea we were provided free food on campus,” she said. “When Wolf gets going on that election map, we can’t take our eyes away.”
AU says that although they’re still committed to making sure their students have the best possible experience, they just now realize some things never come before politics.

Women's volleyball team 2018
Bringing home a championship title is an accomplishment many athletes dream of. Megan Crush, a sophomore libero, tucked this under her belt with her first year as a member of AU’s volleyball team, as they won the Patriot League tournament in 2017. Winning in her freshman year put her life in a whirlwind of excitement, but it came to have a humbling effect on her and her future plans as an Eagle. 
Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Crush was living in an environment rich with a love for volleyball. 
“It was always kind of in my culture and the culture of Louisville to play volleyball at one point,” said Crush, who started playing in the fourth grade. 
Crush attended Sacred Heart Academy, an all girls high school in Louisville. In the gym, almost tauntingly, a single state championship banner hung, reading only one date: 2003. The banner was always “staring [them] down” during every practice, until finally they decided to set a goal, Crush said. 
Her team wanted to be the team that hung a second banner in their school’s gym. Sure enough, in Crush’s senior year, she and nine other seniors fought hard to achieve the goal that they set four years prior – a tearful victory in the state championship game. 
Besides playing volleyball in high school, Crush was also a musician who had been playing piano from a young age, and she was an avid volunteer at her local convalescent center, where she worked with disabled kids. Volunteering was a requirement at her high school, but Crush took it upon herself to exceed the required amount of hours because of her passion for working with the children in the facility. 
Crush’s freshman year at AU came with opportunity through devotion and hard work. 
“I just wanted to work really hard at practices and try to earn playing time so that when my time came when I did get put in that I would make the most of it,” Crush said. 
She successfully played 29 matches with seven starts in the 2017 season. With the help of her peers, Megan grounds herself and sets goals for improvement. Hoakelai Dawson, an AU volleyball alumna, passed along words of advice that have stuck with Crush. 
“She instilled in me that you always have to work for what you have, and don’t take anything the coaches and the athletic department give us for granted,” Crush said.
Megan’s career took off on a high note from her championship win in high school to contributing to her college team’s Patriot League title win a year later. She humbles herself through the positive chemistry the team shares amongst each other and the coaches, both on and off the court.
