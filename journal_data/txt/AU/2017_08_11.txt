	There is no comprehensive reporting system for the number of missing and murdered Native American women and girls in the United States--the only category of missing persons without one. Many reports, however, estimate that Native women are murdered at more than 10 times the 
	national average.

	“Wind River,” although fictional, portrays this bleak reality with a steely resolve. Screenwriter and director 
	Taylor Sheridan (“Sicario” and “Hell and High Water”) paints a picture of life on a reservation in muted, grim tones. The film brings to vivid life how drugs have ravaged the community, how violence so often punctures the fabric of daily existence, how Native culture has been obliterated and how the reservation is a place both forgotten and stigmatized.

Jeremy Renner plays Cory Lambert, a federal wildlife officer who hunts predatory animals at the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. While searching for a mountain lion that has been attacking livestock, he finds the raped and beaten body of a young Native woman in the snow. The tracks point to a seeming impossibility--that she had been running barefoot through the snow for miles. Natalie (Kelsey Asbille), the best friend of Cory’s daughter, had died three years earlier under similar circumstances.

	Rookie FBI agent Jane Banner (
	Elizabeth Olsen) flies in from Vegas, where she is stationed, to investigate the crime. The Tribal Police chief, who has come to accept law enforcement’s utter lack of concern for his people, jokingly remarks, “see what they send us,” when she arrives clad in summery attire in the midst of a blizzard. But Jane is different. The absolute brutality and violence women are subjected to at Wind River shakes her to her core. Olsen makes palpable the feeling of a woman contending with violence against women─as something that feels intensely and viscerally personal.

	Jane asks Cory to help her in the investigation. That dynamic is also really interesting since Jane lacks the typical authority figure hubris. Witnessing the dynamics in a community that has received no help from “the government,” she recognizes that Cory can not only “help her hunt a predator” but that he can also earn the trust of the community, which has no reason to trust anyone outside of it.

	“Wind River” is a so much more than a taut murder mystery. Free of polemics, Sheridan’s director hand turns the lens on how elusive “justice” can be for the Native American community, on multiple levels. Finding the perpetrator of this specific crime can’t offer the satisfaction traditional murder mystery films offer in catching the bad guy, because most other victims never get the dignity of having someone care to find the perpetrators.

	“Wind River” will shake you to your core, but it is an important film to see.

	“Whose Streets” is a first-hand account of the protests following the death of Michael Brown in 
	Ferguson. The necessity of covering the events from a perspective other than that of the mainstream media is without question, and this film offers unprecedented access.
	“Whose Streets” captures the siege-like atmosphere in Ferguson when the protests began─including how the midnight curfew, an intimidation tactic, was couched as a safety measure. A woman shouts, “This is not Iraq,” as officers begin to enforce the curfew that doesn’t start for another 90 minutes. Families in their own backyards are asked to go back inside. In another particularly chilling scene, the memorial for Michael Brown is dismantled, as though the teddy bears and candles, too, have no right to be there. Director 
	Sabaah Folayan stays largely off-screen, instead just letting the intensity of the footage take over.

	One way in which the documentary stumbles, however, is in the choice of featured activists. The way in which their personal lives are brought into the film seems haphazard and the choice of what to include also seems to have no rhyme or reason. For example, the relationship between Brittany and Alexis, a young lesbian couple, seems completely irrelevant to the activist life of Brittany. We also meet 
	Copwatch videographer David who lives in the housing complex where Brown was killed. He offers more insight into what’s it like to watch the very organization that relentlessly watches his community.

	“Whose Streets” doesn’t seem interested in shaping a particular storyline, but instead offers a collage of first-person footage, tweets and Instagram posts. It’s an image of a community pushed past its breaking point. But there are questions that remain unanswered. One scene hints at the tension between the African-American churches and the young activist community, who characterize themselves as not “your Grandaddy’s civil rights movement.” A lot is missing, though, because we never find out what makes them different. There is also no exploration about the ways in which the Black Lives Matter movement is not only about police violence. Ferguson is a city built by 
	racial capitalism, but we don’t really get too much of a sense of how this happened.

	“Whose Streets” does an amazing job of making palpable the anger and pain the community feels after being victimized by a police state for decades. It allows the viewer a perspective never quite seen on mainstream media, which perpetuated the image of the movement as “looters” and “rioters.” It absolutely dismantles this view, in fact. The film could have been a bit more broad in its selection of figures from the movement and in interviewing them more in-depth, but nevertheless, it is an important activist and art work.

A$AP Ferg will perform in Bender Arena on August 26. 
A$AP Ferg will headline this year’s Student Union Board and WVAU kickoff concert in Bender Arena at 8 p.m. on Saturday, August 26, SUB director Bisagna Suh announced in a press release today.
DMV rapper Rico Nasty and hip-hop collective Respect the Bando are also slated to perform. Admission is free with an university ID and $5 for non-AU students.
Ferg, who first came on the scene back in 2011 as one of the standout features on A$AP Rocky’s debut mixtape, is best known for the singles off of his excellent first album, “Trap Lord.” Singles like “Work” and “Shabba” blew up online, but the album was a solid, dark piece of work from start to finish.
More recently, Ferg put out “Always Strive and Prosper” in 2016, which did not receive the commercial success or critical acclaim that “Trap Lord” hinted at. However, his position as the de-facto number two in the A$AP group and his hit song “New Level,” which featured Future, was a chart topper and club hit. 
The rapper is known for over-the-top references to money and violence -- which are so absurd that they are endearing -- as well as bass-heavy production and a storytelling ability that is often dismissed due to his “trap rap” label.
Ferg did a summer tour with Future, Young Thug and Migos, and is gearing up to embark on a fall tour with his A$AP mob, which includes a date at D.C.’s Echostage.

Santana will play in Columbia, Maryland on August 15. 
Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Carlos Santana and his namesake band will play the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland on August 15.
The group emerged at the forefront of music with the band’s legendary 1969 Woodstock festival set, the same year that its self-titled debut LP Santana came out. Santana has sold more than 100 million records and has received 10 Grammys, making the band bonafide legends with 40 years worth of hit songs.
A Mexican-American known for blending in Latin sounds into his rock music, Carlos Santana is considered one of the all-time great guitarists by many, and has hardly lost a step, playing dozens of dates this fall.
Currently, the band features Carlos’ wife, Cindy Blackman, on drums, though the band has seen many members come and go for a variety of reasons. 
His latest record, Santana IV: Live at the House of Blues Las Vegas, came out in late 2016, and featured some of the core members of the original band. The group did not tour in this iteration, sadly, but many of the musicians currently on tour with the legend have been with him well over a decade.
Tickets are still available for the show. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and the show begins at 8:00 p.m.
