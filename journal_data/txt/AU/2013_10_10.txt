The aroma of brewed coffee travels out of the front entrance of The Davenport Coffee Lounge as customers sip their beverages and employees shout their orders. Behind the counter, student employees take orders as they break out in karaoke-style, singing to the music blaring from the speakers. These playful relationships and welcoming smiles sets the tone of  Davenport, or Dav, as students have nicknamed it. 
Before The Dav became what it is today, it was actually a chapel for community building when the School of International Service building was founded in 1957. It now serves as a utopia for those in dire need of a caffeinated pick–me–up after a long, hard day of work or procrastination.
“We really are a big family, we all got close and it’s adorable because we’re all super different, but we all get along,” said Bianca Concepcion, a sophomore in the School of International Service. Concepcion has worked at The Dav for more than a year now. 
The diversity in faculty at the Dav is exhibited through the funky music played in the lounge. The playlists can go from hip-hop and rap to reggaeton, and then switch to indie and pop in an instant.
When Dav employees are not working during the day or going to classes in the evening, they are most likely attending the Dav dinners, where staff gather to grab a bite together. 
“I have met my two best friends through The Dav and became great friends with many more,” said Iana Kozelsky, a sophomore in the School of Communication, who has worked at the coffee shop for a year.
But working at The Dav is not all fun and games. The cafe’s laidback atmosphere can instantly become hectic in a matter of seconds. In between classes, the line to the coffee counter extends beyond the front entrance and into the SIS lobby. As massive crowds form, orders are missed, drinks spill and chaos ensues. In an environment where students serve students, sometimes things can get heated.
“Being the only coffee shop on campus put the Dav in high demand,” Concepion said. “When it becomes really busy, there will be like one person making five drinks at a time.”
Regardless, students at AU appreciate The Dav as much as the employees. All day, people filter through the cafe to sit back and relax with friends, or to sit down and do school work. 
Brianna Mone, an avid customer, said that ”it really does create a sense of community apart from other cafes near the campus.”

Cristobal Soto was one of three Eagles to receive a yellow card in the loss to Navy
AU lost its two-game homestand against Patriot League foe U.S. Naval Academy 1-0 on Oct. 9 in light rain and strong wind. 
AU (4-5-2, 2-1-0 PL) found itself behind early in the game after Navy (5-3-2, 2-0-0 PL) scored a goal in 10 minutes. A costly foul in the box set up a free kick that resulted in a 20 yard unassisted goal by Navy’s junior defender Joseph Greenspan. The foul was one of 11 committed by the Eagles. Over the last three games AU has racked up 32 fouls.
“There were a lot of fouls called today that weren’t fouls, both ways,” head coach Todd West said. “Unfortunately one of the non-fouls that was called decided the game.”
The Eagles attempted to even up the score throughout the first half. They had many opportunities earning three corner kicks, but could not connect with the back of the net. AU was able to go deep into Navy territory and often got inside the box, but were promptly cut off by the Navy defense. Two of the three shots taken in the first half were on goal.
In the second half, AU came out aggressive. In the 56:57 junior defender Conor Osborne was issued a yellow card and three minutes later was issued another yellow card, turning it into a red card. 
“It is not possible for the same player in the same game to be charged with two yellow cards. Albeit the multiple offense may be cautionable offenses, the second card to the same player in the same game shall be red,” NCAA rules states. 
Also under NCAA rules any player issued a red card “is unable to participate in the next regularly schedule game.”
“It’s a frustration that [we] will be without a left-back [Osborne] in a pretty key game against Bucknell,” West said. “We’ll have to juggle the line up but it is what it is and we’ll go back to work and see what we can fix.” 
Osborne has started 9 of the 11 games this season, and has one goal and one assist this season.
The rest of the second half was filled with more yellow cards. On AU’s side, senior defender Cristobal Soto received a yellow card at 62:44 and senior midfielder Patrick Mehlert received a yellow card at 83:33 for obscene language. Mehlert was frustrated at Navy’s attempt to drain the clock during a free kick and yelled at the official “to stop the f**king clock.” Navy was also issued two yellow cards to two separate players.
Navy continued to stop AU’s runs in the box and also continued to apply pressure on senior goalkeeper Billy Knutsen. He collected four saves in the second half and had five saves overall. The goal scored by Navy is only the second allowed by Knutsen in the last four games.
The Eagles continue Patriot League play on Oct. 12 vs. Bucknell at Reeves Field.
