Struggling to find a gift for that special someone? Valentine’s Day presents can be hard to find, especially when left until the last minute. Consider these fun ideas to express your love to those you care about. 
Buttercream Bake Shop
This bakery in D.C.’s Shaw neighborhood is offering Valentine’s Day treats in addition to its regular baked goods. For loved ones, consider the “Be Mine Cupcakes,” pink cupcakes topped with a raspberry macaroon, or the “Chocolate Covered Golden Birthday Cake Oreos.” For a friend, consider the “Boyfriend Brownies,” which display the faces of attractive men on popular T.V. shows. Buttercream Bake Shop is offering delivery on Valentine’s Day for those who live in D.C., and the option to buy a personalized love letter to accompany the delicious treats. 
Darling and Daughters Floral
This local florist is offering Valentine’s Day deals in partnership with Buttercream Bake Shop and Varnish Lane, a local manicurist. The parchment wrapped bouquet is both beautiful and affordable.  
Undone Chocolate
This craft chocolatier is based in D.C. and is a startup working out of Union Kitchen. For both lovers and friends, consider their craft single origin dark chocolate bars. If you’re looking to give a little more flavor, consider the Speciality Inclusion bars, which boast flavors such as cardamom, cinnamon and chili. 
Grocery Store Bouquet
Picking up a bouquet from a grocery store such as the Whole Foods in Tenleytown could be cheaper than ordering one from a florist. Additionally, Whole Foods is using a portion of the sales from these roses to donate to the Whole Planet Foundation. As for a vase, consider getting one from a thrift shop such as St. Albans Opportunity Shop, which is near the National Cathedral. All proceeds from this thrift store benefit those in need in the D.C. community.

Have you ever worked out every day for an entire week? For those of you who have, more power to you. But with working out comes inevitable soreness and muscle pain. Whether it’s leg day, cardio, core or arms, there is always going to be some kind of pain. Some people love that feeling, but others (like me), not so much. A solution is the holistic practice of cryotherapy. 
Capital Cryo, located near AU on New Mexico Avenue is one of two cryotherapy studios in Washington D.C that opened up on Jan. 17. District Cryo is the second. 
“Cryotherapy takes the idea of cold therapy and makes it more efficient and effective,” said Elizabeth Gondela, the director of operations at Capital Cryo. “It has been used for centuries, such as anything from ice packs to ice baths, but allows it to be better monitored.” 
Just like ice baths and ice packs, cryotherapy uses cold temperature to reduce pain and inflammation. 
The process involves a client stepping into a JUKA machine. The JUKA machine is a large, silver tube that releases liquid nitrogen for up to three minutes, while the temperature gradually drops down to -240 degrees fahrenheit. The machine has a thermometer at the top so the client can see how much the temperature is dropping. 
Capital Cryo offers various amounts of treatments and prices. Clients can try whole body cryotherapy with the new client offer that provides the first two sessions for $50, and then after single sessions for $75. 
Gondela recommends the holistic practice of cryotherapy to anyone with pain in their body. A holistic practice focuses on the relationship between the mind, body and spirit. 
The practice started out as a therapy for arthritis, but quickly spread to the athletic industry to treat chronic and muscle pain. It is made for clients who want their body to bounce back from injuries and muscle pain faster and have maximum range of athletic performance. 
Gondela recommends this form of therapy to college students for multiple reasons. 
“College students are balancing so many things at the same time. With course work, internships and sports, this is an efficient way for them to maintain their well-being,” Gondela said. “In just three minutes, student athletes can obtain a quick and efficient way to get muscle recovery and reach peak performance.” 
Although it is not verified by the Food and Drug Administration, Gondela said her clients come recommended by physical and massage therapists. The popularity of cryotherapy in many major cities comes from the numerous amounts of benefits it offers. 
Gondela said that similar to the ice baths, cryotherapy reduces muscle inflammation, resulting in quicker muscle recovery and decreased soreness. It can be used to treat inflammation-related diseases and skin disorders like fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain and eczema. 
Cryotherapy increases the body’s metabolic rate and collagen production, stimulating higher energy levels, an improvement in mood, sleep patterns and skin tone. Gondela said her clients report increased range of motion, chronic pain relief, muscle relief, improved sleep cycles and skin rejuvenation. 
It is a systemic treatment, that will affect the entire body. Gondela said that there aren't any adverse effects of cryotherapy per say, but clients with high blood pressure, heart disease, cold allergy and Raynaud disease, are advised not to participate in cryotherapy due to the extreme cold temperature. However, those who can participate, have experienced many of the benefits of cryotherapy.
I had the opportunity to try a free session with Capital Cryo, and I can confidently say that I was amazed at how effective the process was. After a very unproductive winter break, I had been going to the gym every day for the first two weeks back at school, and my body was sore trying to rebuild muscle. From the waist down, I had muscle pain from doing leg exercises the day before, so I was excited to see how the treatment would work.
First, I was led to a changing room where I was told by Gondela to put on a robe, knee high socks and slippers. She then monitored my blood pressure to make sure I met their criteria and had me go through a list of medical conditions that could prevent me from receiving treatment, such as angina, cancer, pregnancy, etc. 
After signing a waiver, I was instructed to take my robe off, and given gloves to protect my hands in the JUKA machine. Immediately, I felt cold air and saw a grey fog surrounding me. 
On the machine, you are able to see a timer that counts down from three minutes and the temperature of the machine. I was really nervous as I saw the temperature slowly dropping down, as low as -100 and then to -240 degrees Fahrenheit. Gondela advised me to keep my hands above the liquid nitrogen, and to keep going around in a circle in the machine to keep my blood flowing and to relax myself.
The process does not feel like you’re in -240 degrees Fahrenheit. The first minute feels like walking on campus on a cold, windy day. After that, a “pins and needles” sensation occurred, and my body went numb. And yet if the thermometer hadn’t been set at -240 degrees Fahrenheit, I would not have guessed the temperature to be that low.
After I stepped out of the machine, I instantly felt the results. All the soreness and muscle pain I felt from my workout had disappeared. At first I thought it was because my whole body was numb, but later that day, I didn’t feel ache anymore. 
I would definitely recommend this treatment to anyone who deals with a lot of soreness after working out, especially athletes. I’m always hesitant about trying holistic treatments, but Gondela and Capital Cryo have made me a believer in cryotherapy.

Sunday’s dual against Old Dominion University was the match AU needed to win but wasn’t supposed to win. 
On paper, the Monarchs held a slight advantage, competing with four nationally ranked wrestlers, while AU brought three to the contest. ODU also arrived at Bender Arena with three more wins than AU, and had the momentum of coming off win against Ohio University on Friday. But in sport, as in life, nothing is ever simple. 
The Eagles battled from the first match to the last, overpowering ODU 25-14 for notch their fourth win of the season. 
“Old Dominion is another solid team like we’ve seen with the last five teams that we've wrestled,” Teague Moore said last weekend after AU’s loss to Binghamton “We have to bring a fight, and we have to be willing to put ourselves in our positions if we are going to win those matches.” 
And that’s exactly what the Eagles did. 
Senior captain Esteban Gomez-Rivera fought through lingering injury and illness in his match against ODU freshman Alex Madrigal to pull out a hard-earned 4-3 win. The 133-pound AU wrestler attacked from the first second, grabbing Madrigal’s leg and notching the first two takedown points. 
Gomez-Rivera wrestled in control but allowed his opponent two early escapes, bringing the score to 4-2. “Your action, you set the pace,” yelled AU assistant coach Clint Musser, but Esteban found himself fading in the final minutes. “Two minute sprint,” Moore urged in the third period in an effort to inspire his athlete. 
Madrigal went for the attack, scrambling to put Esteban on his back and scored a takedown to take the lead in the third period; yet after Moore challenged the call, Esteban regained the lead and rode out his win. 
His momentum excited his team, particularly 141-pound sophomore Jack Mutchnick, who followed his captain’s performance with a ten-minute overtime victory. Mutchnik battled a defensive match, scoring three of his points through escapes and earning the last and winning point because of his short riding time advantage after the sixth overtime period. 
AU’s third consecutive victory came from sophomore Michael Sprague, a 149-pound wrestler who challenged No. 21 Michael Hayes in a tied dual before escaping and flipping his opponent onto his back. Sprague pumped his arms in the air and pounded the mat in excitement, expressing the importance of his victory over a ranked opponent.
“Michael Sprague finding the fall that he did in a really tight bout, it didn’t look so sure like we were going to come away with the victory and then before you know it, we’re getting the fall,” Moore said.  “I’m really happy with that, and I think that kind of really gave the rest of the team the energy we needed to keep matches close moving forward that we lost, and then in those last three find the victories that we needed.” 
Junior Jeric Kasunic also notched a fall against his opponent in the 197-pound contest.  Yet the fall will still bring confidence to Kasunic, Moore said, and help him stay motivated through the final few weeks of the season. 
“With Jeric, it's about keeping him focused and keeping him working on the things he needs to work on,” Moore said. “Today’s opponent was bumping up two weight classes, so we knew that guy was going to just try and keep it close, which he did, but Jeric didn’t let that phase him. He just kept working until he finally found his position.” 
Gomez-Rivera, Mutchnik, Sprague, Kausnic and 125-pound wrestler Josh Terao, who also earned a win against ODU, accomplished Moore’s team goals of “finding positions” and “bringing a fight.” The Eagles pulled out wins, both those expected to prevail and those who performed an upset, and they notched enough points to put their team ahead at the end of the afternoon. 
The remainder of the season, Moore said, will be about refining those skills necessary to compete against the final two teams on the schedule and carry the athletes into the NCAA tournament. The Eagles face George Mason next Friday for Senior Day and then travel up to Ohio for one final dual meet with Ohio University. In a season full of grueling practices and hours in the weight room, the end is near. 
“As we start to turn focus towards the postseason, really you just want guys as healthy as they can be, as strong as they can be, get their spirits up in the right areas, and usually you’re wrestling will follow through with that,” Moore said. “So we’re not grinding through practices anymore, we’re not putting excessive hours in the weight room. We’re really just trying to make sure that we are as strong as we can be and as healthy as we can be. “

With six minutes left in the fourth quarter Saturday afternoon in Bender Arena, senior forward Lauren Crisler’s lay-up off a pick-and-roll pulled the AU women’s basketball team within two of the Army Black Knights. The Eagles would be outscored 15-6 the rest of the quarter en route to their second straight loss, 68-57.
Army (18-6, 9-4 PL) shot 66.7 percent from the three-point line and finished with three players in double-figure points to claim sole position of third place in the Patriot League. The loss drops AU (11-13, 8-5 PL) to fourth place in the league with five regular season games remaining before the Patriot League Tournament.
Army started the game shooting well, going 50 percent from the field in the first quarter behind eight first-quarter points from junior guard Daizjah Morris. The Eagles trailed by as many as 10 in the first half before slowly chipping away at the Black Knights’ lead.
Junior guard Emily Kinneston and sophomore guard Kaitlyn Lewis helped AU ease back into the game, and the Eagles closed the half strong, using an 8-4 run to cut their halftime deficit to five points. 
“I think we struggled today making layups early and Army got on the offensive boards which hurt us as well,” head coach Megan Gebbia said.
The third quarter was a back-and-forth affair, with each team trading baskets unable to pull away. A close-range basket from Crisler with two minutes remaining in the third quarter gave the Eagles their first lead of the game at 46-45. The Eagles would keep the score close until a barren spell of over four minutes late in the fourth quarter allowed Army to extend their lead to an insurmountable margin. 
Kinneston finished with 20 points for the Eagles, while Lewis added 12 points and five assists. The Eagles held Army’s leading scorer sophomore forward Madison Hovren in check for the first half before Hovren came to life with 11 second half points. Morris’ season-high 15 points led the way for the Black Knights, who outrebounded the Eagles 43-23.
The Eagles return to Bender Arena Wednesday at 7:00 pm to host last-place Lafayette as they attempt to end their two-game losing streak.
“We’re going to be working on a lot of defense the next few days,” Gebbia said. “Lafayette’s a good team, they’re starting to feel good about themselves, they’re playing harder [and] playing better, so we can’t take anyone lightly.”

Happy Valentine’s Day! Did you know February 14 is also National Condom Day in the United States?
Sexual health advocates have worked hard to make the message clear: while you’re doing whatever sexy things you’re doing on Valentine’s Day, be sure to wrap it up. Unless you’re looking for a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or tiny human in the next nine months, condoms are your best bet. 
Last year, I wrote a blog about the importance of female (or internal) condoms as a dual protection method against pregnancy and STIs. On National Condom Day, more than ever, it is crucial to highlight that everyone deserves access to over-the-counter protection, whether they have a penis or not. 
But if we’re being real about the practicality of internal condoms, they can be bulky and expensive, and sometimes outright embarrassing to use. I don’t know about you, but that doesn’t make wrapping up on V-Day sound very sexy. 
When I first read Priscilla Pine’s proposition in “Love And Hope And Sex And Dreams: Make a Man Uncomfortable Today,” it struck a chord. If you haven’t read the piece, I highly recommend doing so, but here is a brief synopsis: men deserve to be called out when they act like jerks. Many women are socialized to respond to male indecency with apologies and kindness, but we should push back. 
Today, on February 14, I have a follow-up proposition – Make a Man Uncomfortable Today: Talk About Your Birth Control. 
Why? 
A few months ago, a slew of articles came out about a clinical trial for a male birth control shot. Spoiler alert: researchers stopped the trial short after men began dropping out because they were experiencing adverse side effects like mood swings, weight gain and acne. 
It doesn’t take a genius to recognize the irony of a situation that women have dealt with for decades; it’s one that reminds us all of that time (probably several) that a partner asked to forego a condom because it was inconvenient or uncomfortable. 
The suspension of the male birth control trial is yet another painful reminder of how much blood we’ve shed (literally) in the name of reproductive health – and what cis men are either unwilling or unable to handle because of it.
So next time you are in that awkward condom negotiation situation, consider this: Pine suggests we reclaim bits of our power – when he doesn’t respond, “text him again” she says, “fav his subtweets.” Before you start a new sexual relationship, make a point to tell your partner what kind of birth control you use. 
Make him feel the implant in your arm or remind him that a doctor recently shoved a piece of metal through your dilated cervix. Let him know that if you can remember to pop your pill every night at 11:01 p.m., he can wear a condom. 
As long as we live in a world where the consequences of unprotected sex fall disproportionately on those who have the least control over it, don’t be afraid to make someone uncomfortable by asking them to cover up this February 14 (and every other day of the year.) 
Happy fornicating!
Jane Haines is a senior in the School of International Service and the College of Arts and Sciences.

Valentine's Day isn’t the same now as it was in elementary school. Back then the holiday was considered a second Halloween, with its abundance of heart-shaped chocolate, lollipops and other candy. 
However, things have changed. For some, Feb. 14 is filled with lust, love, and the promise of a new relationship. But, for others, the Hallmark holiday is filled with loneliness, self-loathing or just plain boredom. No matter what kind of Valentine’s Day you will have this year, The Eagle has you covered with a few albums to enjoy.
Love-Themed Albums
“Acid Rap” by Chance the Rapper (2013)
A happy-go-lucky album featuring unapologetically affectionate hip-hop songs that tease the listeners every step of the way, with tracks such as “Cocoa Butter Kisses,” “Interlude (That's Love)” and more.
“Radio City” by Big Star (1973)
A sublime but loving album featuring sweet classic rock tunes. Heavily influenced by British rock, this album features cheerful early romanticisms of teenage love.
“Good Times!” by The Monkees (2015)
An album that flew under the radar last year, “Good Times!” is a late but amazing comeback album for the pop TV musical group of the 1960s. The album will take you back in time to the baby-booming bubble gum pop era of love and soft rock.
“4” by Beyonce (2011)
This fun-infused hip-hop and funk soul album celebrates the hardship and strides of loving relationships.
“Juno Soundtrack” (2007)
Not a fan of Juno? That’s fine. However, there is no way to get around the fun-loving up and down soundtrack of Juno. The soundtrack features the Kinks, Velvet Underground and much more.
Indifferent/Anti-Love Albums
“Blood on the Tracks” by Bob Dylan (1975)
Hailed as one of the greatest breakup albums of all time, Dylan wrote this folk-rock masterpiece after his divorce.
“Exile In Guyville” by Liz Phair (1993)
While being a critically acclaimed album of the early 90’s, this is a post-punk inspired, feminist anthem. Phair’s first big success is a mixture of young adult angst and independent production value.
“808s & Heartbreak” by Kanye West (2008)
Admired as an underappreciated synth pop album, West wrote this sublime masterpiece after his mother’s death in 2007. “808s & Heartbreak” also followed the breaking of West’s engagement to his longtime fiancée Alexis Phifer.
“Too” by FIDLAR (2015)
One of the most honest and self-loathing albums of 2015, “Too” reminisces about relationships turning sour in the contemporary punk rock world. The album channels influence from lead singer Zac Carper’s relationship with his ex-girlfriend, who died from a heroin overdose prior to the album’s release.
“Bridge Over Troubled Water” by Simon and Garfunkel (1970)
Although the album is filled with upbeat and happy guitar riffs, the folk duo’s fifth and final studio album features tracks about heartbreak and exiting a relationship.
