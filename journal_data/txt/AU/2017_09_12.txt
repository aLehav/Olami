	Since 2001, Epsilon Iota, a former chapter of Alpha Tau Omega, has existed at American University as something of a wicked folk tale, hidden behind a dark, unsettling shroud. Yet, the dangers of this “underground fraternity” are very, very real.

	After the University officially disbanded EI in February of 2001, the organization has continued to operate in the shadows. The group infamously came under fire in 2014 after a series of leaked e-mails indicated they had long fostered a culture of drug use and sexual assault off campus. Before that, two of its members attempted to run over a fellow student with a car--an incident that resulted in both head and spinal injuries to the victim.

	Now, nearly 17 years after the chapter’s dismissal, the administration has finally struck EI with a punishment appropriate to their crimes. AU announced the expulsion of 18 students, while disciplining another for their involvement in the unrecognized organization. After a misconduct investigation and an appeals process, the University concluded they indeed violated an amendment to the Conduct Code and finalized their decision.

	While The Eagle is fully in support of the University’s decision, we would also like to acknowledge that there is much more left to be done. The dismissal of the 18 offenders is just a small step down a path that AU should have started long ago. Although this sets a serious precedent for the future of such cases, EI remains a heinous threat not only to students, but to the integrity of Greek life at American.

	Freshmen arrive at AU not knowing the dangers of associating with EI. When students receive warnings from the administration through e-mail, they often ignore them. But when they come from sources outside the administration, students will take heed. RAs and PAs need to be alerting their residents of the risks involved in attending EI hosted events, especially for freshmen.

	Counterproductively, to focus on their parties is also to publicize them. Rather, The Eagle urges AU to spotlight the real dangers at work here. EI’s history must be made known, and it must be told now. This is a 17-year old-problem and only the beginning of a solution.

	The Eagle staff understands Greek Life is a cherished culture on campus. EI, however, undercuts the fabric of legitimate campus fraternities. Our staff implores fraternities to distinguish themselves from the fraudulent group that has tarnished a respected campus convention. Eliminating EI’s threat to the community is an objective paramount to restoring the safety and security promised to us at AU. The longer we allow this problem to ulcerate on our campus, the likelier someone is to get hurt.

Almost 35% of AU graduate students said they disagreed with the statement "I understand AU's formal procedures to address reports of sexual assault."
Graduate students are walking into AU having experienced unwanted sexual activity before starting their advanced degrees — and there’s a vacuum of on-campus resources available for treatment, according to a study by an AU researcher.
Jane Palmer, a lecturer in the School of Public Affairs who teaches courses in community-based research and gender-based violence, asked more than 900 graduate students in spring 2015 about their past experiences with sexual violence and their opinions about the University’s resources for them. 
Palmer found that nearly 30 percent of the survey’s participants experienced unwanted sexual activity in their lifetime. In a separate question, nearly 7 percent of the surveyed students experienced an unwanted sexual activity since the start of the fall 2014 semester. Yet, in a similar spring 2017 survey with over 1,000 graduate school participants, nearly 40 percent said they disagreed, strongly disagreed or were unsure when asked whether they knew where to go on campus if they or a friend were sexually assaulted. 
“Graduate students see campus resources as something for undergraduates,” Palmer said. “Many use coping skills to get them through school, but many do need a better support system from AU.”
Palmer said she defines unwanted sexual activity as unwanted touching of private areas of the body or having intercourse, which is a broader interpretation compared to other sexual violence experts. She also said the percentages include alcohol related incidents. 
She noted that graduate students do not receive the same types of orientation seminars that incoming undergraduate students do, such as the new consent training from the Peer Wellness Education program, directed by AU’s Wellness Center. 
Scott Patrick, a graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. in political science, sees a connection between the marketing of services at AU and the business model of higher education.
“There is an overwhelming focus on the undergraduate experience because that is the primary ‘product’ of universities,” Patrick, who underwent counseling sessions at AU and is now seeing a therapist off-campus, said. “They are the bread and butter because you can fit many of them in auditorium-sized general ed courses, rather than small graduate level-style courses, where there is more discussion and a higher expectation of knowledge.”
Palmer said the messaging about the different resources sticks to a single, present-time narrative, such as where to go to file a complaint or to collect evidence of an unwanted sexual experience. The language focuses on sexual assaults per incident and not on issues which many survivors face months or years later, Palmer said. 
“Most students think that resources on campus are for immediate treatment after a sexual assault,” Palmer said. “If a student is triggered by something brought up in class, they can get help for it.”
AU’s graduate students typically seek help for dating violence than sexual assault, on-campus advocate said 
Sara Yzaguirre, the University’s coordinator for victim advocacy services at the Wellness Center, said that the graduate students who seek support from her office are typically dealing with precarious issues stemming from unhealthy long-term relationships rather than unhealthy dating or a single sexual assault. 
“Graduate students are in different life stages than undergraduates,” Yzaguirre said. “They are more likely to be in a committed relationship, where undergraduates are dating, and are definitely more vulnerable to sexual violence — largely because of the risk factors associated with the ‘red zone.’”
Graduate students who seek help from AU’s Office of Advocacy Services for Interpersonal and Sexual Violence (OASIS) at the Wellness Center are more likely to be dealing with stalking by an abusive partner after a bad break up or finding safe housing, rather than for single sexual assaults or rape, Yzaguirre said. 
Rob Hradsky, the University’s assistant vice president of campus life and dean of students, said that his office helps students who are being stalked by an abusive partner find emergency housing and rearrange their class schedule if the perpetrator is an AU student. His office will also bar non-AU students from campus. 
He also said his office is one of many resources on campus, but if a student needs a service that is outside the scope of his role, such as counseling, then a staff member will call the appropriate office to arrange appointments on the student’s behalf. 
“I’m sorry to hear that graduate students don’t feel like they have any resources at AU,” Hradsky said. “I think that’s a marketing issue. My office sees about 100 graduate students per year, and the number is growing.”  
Yzaguirre said her office provides all AU students who are victims of dating violence with on-campus options to separate them from their abusers or to refer them to off-campus resources if an AU student is victimized by a non-AU student. Options range from figuring out a safety plan to deciding whether or not to file formal charges with the Title IX office. 
“A safety plan is a term used to describe an individualized planning process that is catered to an individual,” Yzaguirre said. “It matters less whether or not a person is undergrad or grad and more the specifics of their life circumstances.” 
Those circumstances may include whether or not a student has children or lives with the accused abuser. However, a conversation with an OASIS staff member is also centered around the status of the relationship and how the student seeking help wants to proceed with their partner.
If a student is being stalked by a non-AU student, then OASIS will explain the process for obtaining a temporary protective order or a civil protective order, which is essentially a restraining order against an accuser, Yzaguirre said. 
If a graduate student -- who is in the middle of a bad relationship or has been sexually assaulted before graduate school -- can squeeze in on-campus appointments, Palmer said treatment at AU is short-term help. The caveat is that the on-campus resources are already overloaded with students, so if a graduate student wants to use the services, they will probably have to wait, she said.
“I know of one student who really needed help a few years ago,” Palmer said. “But since they worked during the day and had class at night, they couldn’t get on-campus counseling because the office closes at 5 p.m.” 
Patrick said that graduate students need campus resources to support them through their education process just as much as undergraduates, but the services provided cater to undergraduates instead.
“Even though we face the same problems many undergraduates face, such as mental anguish from stress and anxiety or harassment and other inappropriate behavior by faculty, the administration highlights resources and facilities it knows will attract prospective undergraduates and satisfy current ones,” Patrick said.

Liz Pinolini, a law student working for the Washington College of Law's Immigrant Justice Clinic, discusses the U.S. immigration system at a September information session addressing legal questions about DACA. 
The Washington College of Law’s Immigrant Justice Clinic (IJC) and the Office of Campus Life hosted an informational session Friday to “generate community discussion” on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA). Audience members also asked questions in an anonymous Q&A session.
Primarily moderated by law students Katie Conway, Liz Pinolini and Courtney Cataudella, the presentation was held following President Trump’s Sept. 5 announcement that he would begin to phase out the DACA program in six months. 
“We know there are a lot of concerns about the DACA decision,” Conway told the audience gathered in the Kay Spiritual Life Center. “There’s a lot that we know and a lot that we don’t know, and we just want to be here in this community space to see what we can do in the uncertain weeks ahead.”
For those who couldn’t make the session, here is how the IJC answered five key questions on the future of DACA and what recipients can expect:
What exactly is DACA?
According to the IJC, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a program that currently protects 11 million undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. The initiative allows immigrants to get an education, work and obtain a social security number and government ID without worrying about being deported or otherwise pursued by the government. 
The IJC said that DACA is typically issued to younger immigrants, under the age of 16, who have spent most of their lives in the U.S. going to school or starting a career. It does not grant full citizenship. Starting Sept. 5, no new DACA applications will be accepted.
When will DACA stop being valid?
DACA and work permits are valid until their expiration date. If they expire between now and March 5, 2018, they must be renewed. A two-year renewal of DACA must be in the hands of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) by Oct. 5, IJC members said.
DACA recipients are also no longer able to travel abroad through Advance Parole, which permits non-citizens to re-enter the country. DHS is currently rejecting all applications for DACA recipients to travel outside the U.S.
Should DACA recipients fear removal from the U.S.?
There is a possibility that former DACA recipients could be deported due to President Trump’s removal priorities, IJC volunteers said. The Trump administration has said it will prioritize individuals involved with criminal offenses or public safety threats. However, according to the IJC, every individual without lawful status is vulnerable, so it is recommended that undocumented immigrants seek legal assistance and avoid any unlawful activity. Unlawful activity doesn’t just include major crimes: it could be something as small as a traffic offense, IJC members said.
What will happen to financial aid for DACA students?
The amount of financial aid given to DACA students will depend on where the money is coming from, according to the IJC. State and institutional funding will depend on the University, so AU students who are DACA recipients are encouraged to reach out to the financial aid office and ask for more information. DACA students have not been and will not be eligible for federal financial aid, per Education Department guidelines. For scholarships, DACA students are encouraged to reach out to immigrant-friendly organizations.
What can students do if they want to defend DACA recipients?
According to the IJC, the best way to get involved is to volunteer at legal clinics and join protests. An audience member asked if calling state senators and representatives would make a difference, and their response was yes. 
A bill in Congress, titled the DREAM Act, would provide a road to permanent legal status for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. The bill has languished in Congress since being introduced in 2001, but some lawmakers are hopeful it could pass this session.
Valeria Mejía, an AU student and DACA recipient who attended the event, said in an interview with The Eagle that while Trump’s announcement was a devastating blow to her legal status, it is important for all citizens to speak up.
“I think this is something we need to fight for, not just the 800,000 who are affected but the other million,” she said. “I think it’s important for allies to be informed as well and to know how they can help their community.”

Activist and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Malala Yousafzai will speak at AU on Sept. 25 in Bender Arena. 
The Kennedy Political Union has named Malala Yousafzai, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and education activist, the 2017 Wonk of the Year. She will speak in Bender Arena on  Sept. 25, beginning at 8:15 p.m., according to a KPU press release.
Yousafzai is from northern Pakistan and was shot by the Taliban when she was 15 years old while coming home from school. Once she recovered, she traveled the globe as an advocate for girls’ education. 
She was named one of “The 100 Most Influential People in the World” by TIME magazine and released her best-selling book, “I Am Malala" in 2013. In 2014, she won the Nobel Peace Prize.
“Malala is internationally known for her courage and advancing the right of everyone to receive an education,” Shyheim Snead, director of Kennedy Political Union, said in a statement. “She is one of the most inspirational and influential leaders of our generation and embodies the integrity and values that the community aims to achieve.”
KPU will offer free tickets for students on Eventbrite at the following times:
The event, which is co-sponsored by the Muslim Student Association and Women's Initiative, will be presented and moderated by University President Sylvia Burwell. Yousafzai is the fifth recipient of the Wonk of the Year award, with former Democratic National Convention chairwoman Donna Brazile taking the prize in 2016. 
Wonk of the Year is given to someone who demonstrates "engagement, focus, intelligence and passion," according to the KPU release. The event was pushed back to the fall semester after KPU faced scheduling conflicts in April. 
“It is truly an honor to host Malala Yousafzai on our campus,” Burwell said in a statement. “She’s an incredibly brave individual with demonstrated commitment to meaningful change … The AU community is excited to celebrate her courageous and remarkable story.”
