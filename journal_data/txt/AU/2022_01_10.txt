In an email to the American University community Monday, President Sylvia Burwell announced that the University will continue the 10-day isolation period for students who test positive for COVID-19 despite the change in guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“There are ongoing discussions with DC Health and expected updates from CDC specific to higher education communities,” Burwell wrote in the email. “Until the DC Health isolation guidelines for universities change, AU is not testing students out of isolation before 10 days conclude.”
This is a change from a Dec. 29 email to the AU community, where Burwell wrote that those who test positive would be required to isolate for five days. 
The latest information for on-campus operations included links to updated testing hours, the AU self-report portal and a reminder for students to upload proof of booster vaccinations by Feb. 10. The testing hours have been updated to include Saturdays as well as expanded hours on weekdays. 
In the email, Burwell said that while AU still intends for classes and operations to begin in person starting in February, the University is “​​prioritizing predictability in the academic experience and availability of our core support functions amidst omicron-driven disruptions.” 
While AU has shifted to online learning for the month, Burwell announced that the University will not provide discounted tuition or housing.
“Given that classes are proceeding on our original calendar, the campus is operating with services available, and the move to online operations is temporary, there is no tuition discount or prorated fees for housing or meal plans associated with this brief shift,” Burwell wrote.
Alongside COVID-19 information, Burwell included resources for student support and services currently operating on-campus, including the library, the tutoring and writing centers and the wellness center. These services are outlined in the University’s new student guide for the spring semester, which shares information about COVID-19 protocols and campus operations. Burwell also said that the University will provide additional information on the Jan. 31 return to in-person classes and operations.

Elijah Stephens drives to the basket with AU #13 Marvin Bragg and AU #14 Johnny O'Neil looking on.
Eagles can’t fly without their wings, and the coronavirus pandemic has clipped them.
The depleted American University men’s basketball team (4-9) lost to the Lehigh Mountain Hawks (3-10) 61-63 Jan. 1 in a game that came down to the wire. 
The Eagles entered the game without regular starters seniors Josh Alexander, Stacy Beckton Jr., Connor Nelson and standout sophomore Colin Smalls. AU head coach Mike Brennan said all four were out due to COVID-19 protocols after the game but did not know when all four would be able to return to the team. 
Despite this, AU found strength from its bench, and the Eagles started the first half on fire. The Eagles soared past their competition and took a 19 point lead with about seven minutes left in the first half, and went into halftime up 35-26. 
Sophomore sensation Johnny O’Neil led the Eagles’ offensive in the first half. O’Neil scored all 12 of his points during the period, his jump shot lethal from three and in, and Lehigh seemed incapable of stopping the 6-foot-9-inch forward. The scoring came from other sources too in the first half. High flying senior Jaxon Knotek, sophomore Lorenzo Donadio and freshman Elijah Stephens each scored six points in the period, and the AU offense operated like a well-oiled machine.

AU also deployed a Fort Knox-like defense that complemented the Eagles’ devastating offense and the Mountain Hawks’ stubborn refusal to stop taking three-point shots. Lehigh, who is last in the Patriot League in points per game and three-point percentage, threw up brick after brick and went seven minutes without scoring a point. Lehigh finished the half shooting a measly 39 percent from the field, 20 percent from three-point range and it seemed like AU was cruising to a comfortable victory.
But the momentum shifted in Lehigh’s favor to start the second half. AU’s offensive output was lethargic to begin the final period, and the Eagles could only muster seven points in the first seven minutes. AU’s inability to score was most acute at the free-throw line, and the Eagles went 5-13 during the second half. 
Lehigh took advantage of AU’s stalled offense and began attacking the basket. AU’s ironclad defense faltered under the Lehigh assault, and the Mountain Hawks deliberately accrued an eight-point lead with less than nine minutes left that seemed to put the game out of reach. 
AU did not submit and slowly tried to climb out of the hole they had dug for themselves. Stephens took control of AU’s offense and attacked the basket, again and again, weaving his way around Lehigh’s determined efforts to stop him. With layup after layup, Stephens’ 12 points in the final period kept the Eagles in the game. 
Knotek also contributed seven points in the final period, although AU’s offense was spluttering, and O’Neil showed the Mountain Hawks his knack for emphatic blocks with three rejections in the half. Despite this, AU couldn’t erase Lehigh’s lead, and down by four with 39 seconds left, out of timeouts and Lehigh inbounding the ball, AU needed a late Christmas miracle. 
Stephens nearly delivered that miracle for the beleaguered Bender Arena crowd. Stephens stole Lehigh’s inbounds pass and sank a layup to cut the lead to two. A Lehigh dunk brought the Mountain Hawks’ lead back to four, but Stephens secured an offensive rebound off an errant AU three and drained his own triple to bring the score to 62-61 with 18 seconds left. 
2nd Half | 0:18 | He's got 18 points and that three-pointer makes this verrrry interesting... Ok @thekideli3! 🔥📺: https://t.co/lVSqEXL6Yr pic.twitter.com/5khH6u8YS6
However, AU was forced to foul Lehigh’s Reed Fenton ensuing possession, and the Mountain Hawk went to the line to make it a three-point game. Fenton made the first free throw, but despite being Lehigh’s third-best free-throw shooter, the junior guard missed the second and AU secured the rebound. With 11 seconds left in the game, Stephens got the ball and drove toward the basket. 
Stephens seemed to have a step on his defender as he reached the paint, but the freshman opted not to attempt the layup, and as time ran down, Stephens passed to sophomore Matt Rogers in front of the basket. The forward’s layup hit the rim but did not go in and the game was over. 
Brennan said after the game he was happy with Stephen’s decision and said that the freshman was a “terrific decision-maker.”
“He got Rogers a shot right at the rim so you can’t ask for a better decision than that.”
Despite the loss, Knotek and Stephens’ presence off the bench has been a revelation this season. After playing three years at North Dakota State University, Knotek is an offensive spark for the Eagles, averaging 6.5 points per game this season, and the Wisconsin native energized the Eagles all season with several rim-shaking dunks.

Stephens has also been an instant offense for the Eagles, and the standout of Brennan’s 2021-22 recruiting class has played in all 13 games and is fourth on the team in assists. Brennan said he was happy with the team’s performance despite the circumstances.
“I’m not happy they’re getting their experience in this fashion, but I am glad they are getting experience because we’re going to need them,” Brennan said.
AU will face Boston University next Jan. 10 at 7 p.m. EST at Bender Arena. AU’s originally scheduled game against Colgate Jan. 7 was rescheduled to Feb. 21.

American University’s Disabled Student Union is petitioning University administrators to require frequent coronavirus testing of all faculty and students in the name of equal and safe education for community members with disabilities.
The petition says that the University’s lack of enforcement of safety measures limits students’ access to the right to a safe and equal education guaranteed to them in Section 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act. By testing community members at least twice a month, the University could help to slow the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable students in the process, according to DSU.
According to DSU President Katherine Greenstein, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs,  DSU met in December and expressed a number of frustrations with the University’s existing testing policies.
“Our members were feeling very frustrated, because we’ve spent two years watching our community kind of be seen as disposable,” Greenstein said.
After expressing these frustrations, a member suggested students take matters into their own hands and write a petition. 
“I drafted it in a night … I had to write it, I got a bunch of people to look over it, I posted it,” Greenstein said. “And then it’s been kind of a whirlwind since because it picked up quite a bit of attention.”
The petition now has over 1,600 signatures and has garnered support from a number of campus organizations, including the AU College Democrats and the SPA Undergraduate Council. Sixteen members of the American University Student Government Undergraduate Senate later signed their own letter of support for the petition. 
“Not only does mandated testing provide additional protection for the health of the student body and the DC community, but it follows suit with universities such as George Washington University, Cornell University and others who have implemented similar measures to increase campus safety,” SG Senate representatives wrote in their letter.
The Disability+ Faculty and Staff Affinity Group, co-founded in part by Tanja Aho and Anna Cook, also expressed its support for the petition, helping to publicize it and garner support. 
“We believe that the Disabled Student Union is absolutely correct in asking AU to step up and do better and provide more safety and protection for its students through regular testing. To us, the safety of students and, of course, the faculty and staff as well should always come first before any other considerations,” Aho said. “And if we want to resume in person classes and be back in community, we need to do so in a safe way that protects all of our community members.”
In a recent question and answer session with SG President Chyna Brodie, Brodie said that the University is unable to mandate frequent testing due to limitations posed by its partnership with external testing party ShieldT3 and a lack of an in-house lab at the University to process testing results. 
“​​This petition … does not represent viable change here at American University because it fails to acknowledge the capacity of our school to conduct primary COVID-19 testing compared to other university systems,” Brodie said in the Q&A. 
In an email to The Eagle, Elizabeth Deal, University spokesperson, wrote that the administration is “requiring testing for all AU community members … before and once returning to campus/affiliated AU buildings.”
“We continue to employ a comprehensive approach using all available tools, while following the data to mitigate risk. We will also continue to review and adapt our policies and protocols as necessary to ensure the ongoing safety of our community,” Deal wrote. “We have offered testing since the start of the academic year and the data shows our community is utilizing testing, particularly during higher risk periods, such as travel and during surges.”
Cook said in an interview with The Eagle that she feels privileged to be working remotely and knows many faculty and staff members who still feel unsafe. 
“It’s not just something on this student's mind, it was also something on the mind of faculty and staff as well, especially when we were talking about meeting students face to face in small offices,” Cook said.
Greenstein emphasized the positive impact that mandatory testing would have on DSU members and on the University as a whole.
“Our organization was anxious, our members were anxious, we were struggling, because it is hard to handle being scared for your life and trying to learn at a collegiate level at the same time,” Greenstein said.
For Greenstein, the decision to start the petition was a sign that they were no longer willing to wait for the University to take action. 
“The University should be including marginalized communities in discussion of policy and disabled people especially should be especially privy to conversations surrounding public health,” Greenstein said. “This is what affects us. That is the whole point. And the fact that we weren’t included in that discussion, the fact that our voices haven't been heard in that discussion is why the petition became necessary in the first place because they weren't listening to us.”
