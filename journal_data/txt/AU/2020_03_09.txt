Marc E. Bassy performed at U Street Music Hall on Feb. 18.
Whether you’ve heard him on your Spotify’s Discover Weekly or saw him perform live in concert, Marc E. Bassy is taking the music industry by storm. After the up-and-coming artist released his latest album, “PMD,” in September of 2019, his monthly listeners have continued to rise in numbers. 
Bassy has been in tune with his musical talents since he was young and decided to pursue a career doing what he loved, taking time to craft his writing and music.
Bassy started out a member of the L.A.-based band 2 A.M. Club before pursuing his own venture in music. He performed at U Street Music Hall on Feb. 18, exhibiting his ability to naturally entertain the crowd. He currently has 4 million Spotify listeners and has come a long way from the start of his career. 
Bassy has expanded away from the “tragically hip cool people music” that he connected with in his early 20s. He feels like he has now been able to write his lyrics with a good blend of genres. Having been gifted with writing and catching melodies at a young age, Bassy believes that his true calling is with his music.
Here’s what Bassy had to say as he plots his next decade of music.
Devika Knafo: Your music is a combination of hip hop, smooth R&B and heartfelt lyrics. Your album “PMD” is an ode to this generation's lack of connection. You mentioned that “we live in a world where everyone is more connected than ever but feels more lonely than ever.” How have you been able to explore this idea, and what have you been able to find?
Marc E. Bassy: I think that the more I explore it and think about it, it’s not just about people being more alone than ever, it’s about people not feeling comfortable being alone because they feel like they are supposed to be plugged into something at all times. I saw that when it came to having limitations on things, I could see things in life getting shorter. This behavior we have is addictive, suppressing mankind’s curiosity, and we find ourselves in this cycle of repetition that is never-ending.  
DK: Have you felt a personal disconnect with the world because of the changes happening in society with the way people act and behave around each other? What things have you learned about life and the human condition that has shaped your music and its purpose?
MEB: I used to be more idealistic, like everyone around us. I used to think of music as something revolutionary. I saw music as something that existed in a way that was subtle and not on purpose. I’ve learned that it’s more about how you say something, rather than what you say. And no one wants to hear someone barking at them or preaching at them. We want to hear someone turning into a master of their craft - that’s what is inspiring. And things that are trying to be something without naturally carrying that energy just go out of style and don’t live on, and I want my music to live on. When I first started touring, it started as something where I wanted attention and to be desirable, and there was this ego trip stuff that came with it all.
I felt like there were many people who weren’t doing things because they kept telling themselves that they can’t, and it never occurred to me that I couldn’t. I always thought I wanted to be in the NBA, but then I had a personal trauma and a near-death experience when I was 17, and I had to spend time in the hospital. The second I walked out and recovered, I told myself I can do anything, so why wouldn’t I do something I like? I loved what I was doing with music at the time, so I figured, why not take this seriously? I didn’t really know how to do what I was doing, but I wanted it so bad because it was so much fun. I loved playing with that energy that came with creating a song. I never did anything creative before music - I was just an athlete, so it was new to me. I was so behind, but so confident for how bad it was. I was all in and it's taken me 10 years to perfect my craft.
DK: What is the purpose behind your music? What emotions do you want to stir up in people who listen to your music? What do you want people to feel? Additionally, how have you expressed vulnerability?
MEB: I want people to not be afraid to be themselves. I want people to listen to my music and be like “I can be myself too, publicly with no shame.” Once I get on the record, that's my time to say what I want, to be what I want and I don't have to be afraid or pretend. If I feel like taking a chance and being someone else, I can do that. I can do anything I want. I want people to be inspired by what they do and be who they are - you are creating an identity for yourself, so find that freedom for yourself.
DK: How do you feel the Internet has impacted the music business?
MEB: I think that America is changing, people’s standards are changing [and] people's interests are changing. There are a lot more opportunities for entertainment. I feel like California is the only place where your social life is completely linked to your professional life. It doesn’t matter how hard you work at your craft, it depends on who you know and how many followers you have. I appreciate the industry and wouldn’t want to have it any other way. But this lifestyle in California has influenced many themes for my albums in the past and also “PMD.” Until I leave L.A., the theme of my music is gonna be L.A. That’s the theme. Every album has been about the things that come with L.A.: the sex, drugs, expectations, the social media craze. I’m still a mystery to myself, and that’s a mystery to me.

AU Wrestling at the EIWA Championships in Lehigh on March 6-7, 2020.
Redshirt juniors Kizhan Clarke (149), Tanner Harvey (184) and Gage Curry (125) qualified for the NCAA Championships at the EIWA Championships on March 6 and 7 at Lehigh University. 
For Curry, who is ranked 20th nationally and came into the EIWA tournament as a five seed in his weight class, this will be his third appearance at nationals in three years. He finished in fourth place after losing in the quarterfinals to Army’s No. 19 Trey Chalifoux, but bounced back in the consolation bracket to defeat Brown’s Trey Keeley, Hofstra’s Dylan Ryder and Cornell’s Dominic Lajoie. Curry earned one of the conference’s automatic bids to the NCAA Championships.
Harvey, also ranked 20th nationally and fourth-seeded in the tournament, defeated Army’s Noah Stewart 9-3 in overtime to finish third in the 184-pound class. He captured his second appearance at nationals since transferring to AU from Southwest Oregon Community College.
This will be Clarke’s first time at the NCAA Championships, as he came into the tournament as the one seed and ranked 12th nationally. Though he only finished fourth in his division at the tournament, he fulfilled his season-long goal of qualifying for nationals after just missing out last year when he wrestled at 157 pounds. 
“My ultimate goal is to be a national champion,” Clarke said earlier this season after a January match against Navy. “First I gotta make it to nationals, that’s one of my biggest goals since I haven’t been to nationals yet. And I feel like to do that, I have to remind myself that I’m up there [competing] with the greatest guys when I put my mind to it.”
Redshirt senior Sal Profaci (141) also came into the EIWA Championships as a one seed, but had a disappointing showing during the tournament. Ranked number 23 in the country, he lost in the quarterfinals 8-6 to Binghamton's Anthony Sparacio. He then suffered an overtime loss in the consolation bracket to Franklin & Marshall’s Wil Gil 12-10, ending his time at the EIWA Championships without a qualifying bid for nationals. To continue his final season, he will have to receive one of the 47 at-large bids to the national tournament, which will be announced on Tuesday.
Fellow AU redshirt wrestlers freshman Tim Fitzpatrick (165), junior Anthony Wokasch (174) and sophomore Niko Camacho (285) also had strong performances at the EIWA Championships with Camacho finishing seventh in the heavyweight division, and Fitzpatrick and Wokasch finishing eighth in their weight classes. The team, as a whole, finished ninth in the tournament.
“I’m very happy for our six place winners,” head coach Teague Moore said after the tournament. “Tanner Harvey earned a victory over an opponent he had lost to the last three times they met. Kizhan Clarke finished fourth, improving his placement from last year’s EIWAs. Gage Curry once again qualifies through to the NCAAs ... We look forward to the NCAA Championships and are excited to get back to work in preparation for nationals.”
The NCAA Championships take place March 19-21 in Minneapolis, Minn., where Clarke, Harvey and Curry will take on the nation’s best wrestlers in hopes of becoming national champions.
