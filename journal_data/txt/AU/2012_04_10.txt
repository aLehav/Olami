The beating of Brazilian drums echoed through campus as Take Back the Night participants raised awareness for sexual violence on April 9.
Women’s Initiative hosted the event that began with a performance by Batala, an all-women’s drumming group, in the amphitheater and ended with a vigil and testimonials in the Kay Spiritual Life Center.
“In terms of our big events,” said Carmen Rios, the director of Women’s Initiative, “what I really like about Take Back the Night is that we talk about something that needs to change and we take the survivors and give them the ability to speak.”
Before the event, Executive Vice President of AU’s Inter-Fraternity Council Brendan Bargmann stirred up controversy when he posted on Facebook that Take Back the Night marchers were “inexplicably angry women.” He also urged people to call Public Safety and file noise complaints. 
“Every year there’s someone speaking out against the event or reacting about it negatively in a way that’s not what we’re about,” Rios said.  
When later asked about his Facebook post, Bargmann apologized. 
“I want to get across that this is an accident due to my stupidity, a nexus between me making a bad joke and ignorance and I just feel terrible about it,” Bargmann said. 
He said his original post was only meant to joke about the noise of the drumming and was not meant to “debase the whole point of what the night was.”
Bargmann has since stepped down, according to AUIFC President Amory Brandon said in an op-ed to The Eagle. 
Nicole Dashiell, a freshman in School of International Service, said she attended the event to show her support for victimized women worldwide. 
“No one’s taking rape seriously,” she said. “A lot of people on my floor were making fun of us saying it was a buzz kill, but I think it’s important to go.”
Rios said approximately 300 people attended the event. Participants marched from the amphitheater to Southside, finally coming to a stop on the Quad in front of Kay.
Energized by Batala’s beats and Rios’ words, Dashiell joined hundreds of other supporters in shaking maracas, chanting, “No more silence, no more violence,” and holding signs that said, “Yes means yes and no means no.” 
The event concluded just as it started to rain. Take Back the Night supporters paused before the steps of Kay, passed around candles and listened to the AU all-female a capella group Treble in Paradise sing “Stand by Me.”
“I was pleasantly surprised by [Take Back the Night],” Bargmann said after the event. “I got into it and the message behind it.”
Laura Kiefer, co-director of WI’s Stopping Violence Against Women Department, concluded the event by saying, “There is this community to support me. It is life changing... I’m going to stand up for what I believe and I’m going to take back the night.”

•Someone remind me why I stayed at AU while the rest of my family is on vacation... on a beautiful island far from the wicked stench of DC sewer air...



•I like you a lot, but I'm worried if I tell you, hanging out will just get way too awkward.
•"And I have known the eyes already, known them all..."
Thank you other Eliot ranter :)
•Seriously, stop caring about other people's sex lives. It's none of your business what I choose to do. Stop trying to force your values down my throat, because I didn't ask for your opinion.
•congratulations, you read an article on promiscuity. now read one on sincerity and come back when you give a crap about how 'depressed' we're going to be for our 'promiscuity'.
•I intern, have a job, volunteer, take 16 credits, and have a pretty active social life. But what am I thinking about most of the time? How excited I am to have explosive sex with my f*** buddy.
•@Pitt bomb threats--yes.  My house is a few minutes away from one of the campuses.  It is very sad to see this happening.
•Do you want to know why I hate the feminists on this campus? It's because they never shut up- I am in the same sociology classes with you semester after semester and I am tired of hearing what you have to say. The classes I am in are not about feminism, so if you could STFU I would appreciate it...
•You got that something that keeps me so off balance.
•@"there are people in this world who would kill you, your family, your friends, anyone who is opposed to them in a heartbeat. But there are people out there stopping them."  The world is not black and white like you portray. It’s not ‘the bad guys vs us, the good guys’. People don’t randomly hate other people for no reason.  Maybe think about WHY they hate us and what we CAN DO to rectify this anger (hint: more bombings and killings are not helping the situation, only making it much much much worse).
•@"(I'm going to continue posting this until someone replies that they picked it up... hopefully whoever lost it sees this!)" Um what if they picked up their stuff at lost and found but they don't read eagle rants. Just sayin...
•I hope the person who ranted "finally free. you held me down for far too long" was not my ex-boyfriend. I hope that was not how you felt about our relationship because I thought it was pretty great
•When we first met, I was 100% positive you were gay...Then we became friends and I learned you are straight. I'm still waiting for the day you realize you're gay.....
•@join AUCR's and try to make that more prevalent on campus but please do not create this club” Are you serious here? The college republicans disgust me. I identify as libertarian. But I would totally join the conservative feminist group because women’s initiative doesn’t actually accomplish any substantive policy that would help women. Maybe the conservative group would.
•People say the anonymity of the internet brings out the worst in people. But I couldn’t disagree more. Anonymous eagle rants are so full of support for others and concern for helping our community. It really warms my heart when strangers reach out to ne another. Anonymity is totally awesome. (Or maybe the editor is filtering 10 nasty mean rants for every nice rant that is posted. Hmmm)
[Editor's notes: This editor filters the extremely mean, curse-filled, racist, hateful, etc. Rants.]
•@lost and found ranter: Why don’t you just go to lost and found and ask if someone picked up what you dropped off?
•What does FTL mean? Can we PLEASE stop making up acronyms. K thanks.
•@liberal housewife after college: Me too! Why does everyone assume housewives have to be conservative?  So annoying.  I plan on adopting very liberal parenting methods for my kids and cooking organic vegan meals every night. Yay liberal housewives!
•It’s I’m an idiot WHO likes boys, not THAT likes boys. Do we really need to go over this basic grammar concept yet again?
•So conservative women don’t like the abortion stuff, and liberal women want women to be able to not have to worry about getting pregnant. So can we all just rally together around making birth control more accessible? This leads to fewer abortions (which should make the conservatives happy) and more ability to plan one’s own timing of when to start a family (which should make liberals happy). Do we have a deal?
•@where do Au students go to party? : Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?
•My word search was defective. Not cool. Not cool.
•How few calories does one have to consume before one has an eating disorder? -scared I may be anorexic
•So I pooped at my boyfriend's apartment and forgot to flush the toilet. He definitely saw. How do I fix the awkwardness?
•Question for women who don’t believe in legal abortion : Do you just sit around wishing that women will stop having abortions or do you actually think about how to rectify the situation, like having over the counter birth control pills so women who don’t want to be pregnant never end up getting pregnant in the first place (and therefore will not need abortions).  This is a serious question, and I would love an answer from a conservative female who opposes legal abortion.
•Remember the time Gary Johnson came to AU? That made my life. Gary Johnson 2012! No more foreign wars. Fixing the deficit by legalizing and taxing marijuana. Marriage equality. Where is all the AU support for this socially tolerant and fiscally conservative presidential candidate? You know he is going to win right?
•Can we really not choose who we fall in love with? This has to be an urban myth. TELL ME THIS IS JUST A MYTH?
•If you were my girlfriend,
I'd respect you absolutely.
I'd protect but not cage you.
I'd write poetry about you, even if you weren't around to hear it.
I'd dance with you into the wee hours of the night.
I'd make you laugh without trying.
But you are not my girlfriend.
You're the girlfriend of the guy who just called me "broseph" and told me how hard he was going to "tap that". Such is life.
•One day I'll like someone I agree with politically, but apparently that day is not today.
•I hate phone interviews!!! I hate them!! I hate all kinds of interviews!!!! Waaahh!! Can't we just, like, I duno, pretend that my resume says EVERYTHING about me, and leave it at that??? gughhghgh so nervous!
•To the absolute moron who is cheating on his beautiful girlfriend: I'm on to you. The only reason I'm not going to kick your ugly rear from here to Japan is because I know you're getting busy with another guy. I would never out you to the world, but I swear to science if you don't own up to your girlfriend about what you're doing...
•Guys at this school need to learn that "jokes" about sexual assault and harassment just aren't okay. Joking about something this serious makes it seem like it is not as big an issue as it is. I was involved in a sexual harassment case recently, and it is just wrong for someone to make my situation seem more okay for the perpetrators through "jokes".  It's not funny, and it's not okay to say these things.
•Look over there!
Look over there!
Somebody loves you THAT much!
•@feminist who doesn't support abortion. You're allowed to not like or want an abortion. The inherently anti feminist thing would be if you were acting to take away the rights of OTHER women to not get abortions. Wanting equal pay and equal rights is fine and dandy and feminist but infringing on the rights of other women to do what they want with their bodies is wrong.
•@AU feminists encourage promiscuity (there are lots of you).
I'm pretty sure they don't encourage it as a one size fits all. They encourage it for those who feel comfortable because, growing up, everything you hear is that having sex makes you damaged goods or a bad person. they encourage people to embrace their sexuality as something to not be ashamed of. It's not for everyone, but it's empowering to know that there is that option for people who want it
•@basic rules of economics.
here's the big problem. I'm a WOMAN, a PERSON, not a GOOD OR A SERVICE. bite me.
•CORRELATION DOES NOT PROVE CAUSATION. You cannot say that sexually "promiscuous" women have higher rates of depression because they are promiscuous. There's an association, yes, but to assume that sleeping with higher-than-average numbers of men CAUSES depression is a huge leap that neither you nor science can make.
•I wish real life worked like facebook, where each person walks around with a friend button I can click on. There's so many interesting people I could be friends with if I weren't so awkward :(
•That awkward moment when you go to a party full of alumni who have been called by the phonathon and have to defend the phonathon and its workers to them...
•Long Islanders, please join me in prayer for everyone dealing with the brush fire back home. My heart goes out to everyone, and I hope that by the time this is posted, it will be quelled and there will not be too much damage.
•This eagle rant does not exist.
•All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
All men are Socrates.
•To the 25 year old girl with no close female friends: I'm also 25 and have no close female friends. Just know you aren't alone!
•Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...
•And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together
•People can hate all they want on TDR, but their mashed potatoes last night were DREAMY.
•What about military doctors? What about service people who get their MD's? I just blew your minds ranters
•Who just posted some TS Eliot? ...I love you.
•what's the point of take back the night?
[Editor's note: "Take Back the Night seeks to end sexual violence in all its forms including sexual assault, sexual abuse, dating violence, and domestic violence ... Take Back the Night's goal is to create safe communities and respectful relationships through awareness events and initiatives."]
•@Pitt Bomb Threats - I was between Pitt and AU...this is reason #1001 that I'm glad I came to AU! But I've been following it and I'm very concerned because I have a lot of friends there :/
•@Bullying Club @Editor - if I rant my e-mail to the bullying club person, and he/she rants his/her e-mail to me, would you be able to e-mail the two of us so we'd have each other's e-mails or something like that?
[Editor's note: Uhh, that's way complicated. Why not just meet up somewhere?]
•when i say i miss you i mean it. when i say i love you i mean it.
maybe we should be more than friends, but i dont know if you feel the same way :( #onemonthtoshowyouiloveyouforreals
•North Korea! Stop sending nuclear rockets in the direction of my family!!!!!!!! seriously, stop. No one will think you are cool.  Not even China.  They don't even really like you anyway.  You don't even really like you. god!
•@"condoms in the wellness center could have holes too" It's not my logic! it's the logic of AU. now see why I'm ranting?
•Where are the lesbians on this campus?  Is there some secret underground lair that I don't know about?
•Editor...please keep editing for content. It's very disappointing scrolling through a list of boring, repetitive rants day in and day out. I very much appreciate the fact that u are not allowing certain ones, it makes it better for the rest of us :)
[Editor's note: Then this editor gets "yelled" at for alleged censorship...]
•To the person on the 6th floor that complained about a black male sleeping on the north lounge couch in the wee hours of sunday morning, i hope public safety comes after your ass someday. people do know him on the floor and the fact that you felt the need to report him based off of his race shows how f-ing ignorant you are. racial profiling at its best @AU!
•You see the sizes S, R, L and you think they'd be small, regular, and large. But no. The creators of tampons apparently wanna fuck with hormone-crazed women. They did the complete opposite and renamed internationally recognizes sizes to super, regular, and light. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!
•I need to stop creeping on your facebook/twitter. It makes me miserable yet I can't stop doing it. Anyone else have this problem??
•PLEASE just get up with me already, i enjoy hangingout/hookingup with you but i can't take this waiting game!!
•Why is amword so bad? I feel bad for ranting about how bad it is but the most recent issue was awful. Most of the photographs were pixelated or blurry and some of the text was illegible. Please, get your act together. This isn't even the first time this has happened.
•I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????
•I promised myself not to text you too much in order to avoid looking desperate and/or creepy...But at the same time constantly refreshing Facebook chat waiting for that little green dot to pop next to your name is only slightly less stalkerish. And inevitably more frustrating.
•Lets face it. Mark Zuckerburg is the root of all evil when it comes to academic productivity
•How anybody at the Facebook offices ever get anything done is beyond me. Their stalking skills must be at ninja levels now
•I'm feeling the J. Alfred Prufrock as well.
•I thought my gay-dar was bad, but my ***hole-dar is even worse.
•Running at night is the best
•I love literature so much. I love my classes. I love everything we read, and our discussions. I just hate having to write papers SO MUCH. I've written exactly three sentences in four hours.
•My friend has been acting really out of character. She has started having casual sex. She talks about how desirable and irresistible guys find her. And she is exhibiting higher anxiety than usual. These are all symptoms of a rape victim right? Am I completely off base here?
•Look, I understand: working at the residence hall desks can be very boring business. And hey, it's always great to talk to friends if they come to visit you there. But seriously, some of you don't give a flying feather. I was struggling with a lot of things and you were of no aid. Again. At least this time I didn't spill anything, but seriously? Get your eyes off the computer screen for more than two seconds. Thanks.
•Was it a TS Eliot reference or Chocolate War reference?
•Re: feminists and sexuality.  AU feminists (and other feminists) do not promote the idea that women should be have casual sex or many sex partners.  What they promote is the idea that women CAN do those things if they want to.  Just as women CAN wait to have sex until they are married, or only have sex with people in committed relationships.  The point of feminism is that a woman's value does not stem from her sexual decisions, and that they she is no better or worse than any other person for whatever sexual decisions she chooses to make.
•@ person who posted TS Eliot: Thanks, you are getting me through bio lecture
•@everyone who explained how we can be for women but not identify with the feminist movement: YES YES YES I love you all. You're spot on. Had no idea there were more of us on campus, this is awesome =D

The point of feminism is that a woman's value does not stem from her sexual decisions, and that they she is no better or worse than any other person for whatever sexual decisions she chooses to make.
•@ person who posted TS Eliot: Thanks, you are getting me through bio lecture
•@everyone who explained how we can be for women but not identify with the feminist movement: YES YES YES I love you all. You're spot on. Had no idea there were more of us on campus, this is awesome =D

In the span of a year, junior midfielder Emily Burton has gone from averaging just over one goal per game to becoming one of the top scorers in the country for the AU women’s lacrosse team.
“She’s really stepped into an upperclassmen role this year, and just her confidence with the ball [has improved],” AU Head Coach Laura Campbell said. “It’s really exciting to see. She is very consistent and dependable, and when she dodges, we know she’s going to score because that’s really what it comes down to.”
Burton, who began the week tied for 13th in the nation with 3.33 goals per game, has notched a team-high 41 goals on the season. The midfielder surpassed her goal total from 2011 just eight games into the 2012 campaign. 
One of the things she’s improved most is her shot percentage, which has increased over 20 percent.
“I think that more shooting practice has definitely helped,” Burton said. “I’m also putting myself in better positions to shoot, so that’s helpful. Getting in a lot more shots in practice has made it easier to find the net in games.”
Burton has only been held scoreless in one contest throughout 13 games, and has dished out an assist in half of them. She also ranks in the top 90 players in the country in draw controls with 33, 29 more than her total last year.
Although Burton’s jump in production has been significant, Campbell says she isn’t really that surprised.
“For Emily, I have always had pretty high expectations, and I have been pretty hard on her since the day I’ve gotten here, because I knew how much potential she had,” Campbell said. “She’s putting herself into position to score. She’s made that decision this year. We’ve talked about her doing it last year, but now she’s really doing it, and she’s just a threat everywhere, and it’s really, really awesome.”
Burton said consistency has been the key to achieving success.
“I think for me, consistency has always been my biggest issue,” Burton said. “So when I realized I was contributing a lot each game, I felt confident with how I was playing. I think just looking at how we were playing as a team and how I was contributing, I think that really helped me to keep it going.”
Burton said her teammates have been helpful as well during her breakthrough season.
“It’s absolutely a team effort,” Burton said. “Lauren Schoenberger and I work really well on the crease together, and we look for each other for a quick pass or a quick feed. Kimberly Collins and Samantha Marshall are always looking for the feeds in the middle. We’ve been playing together in attack for two or three years now, and I think we’re starting to really come together and mesh well.”
One thing that makes Burton’s success this season so special is that she’s been able to keep it going during the most important part of the season: Patriot League play. She’s been terrific in conference games, tallying almost three goals per game and has been even better in draw controls.
Although her ability to pile up goals is what grabs most people’s attention, she’s also a terrific contributor in other ways, particularly off the field.
“She has the best personality,” Campbell said. “She just brings a lot of positive energy to the team. [She] knows when it’s time to chew her teammates out when they need it and she’s just a goofball too, which is awesome because sometimes that’s needed.”

The week’s best concert is a garage pop doubleheader, with Brooklynites Crystal Stilts and Widowspeak sharing a bill at the Rock and Roll Hotel on April 14. 
Crystal Stilts’ brand of noise pop borrows from a whirlwind of influences, pairing lead singer Brad Hargett’s Beat Happening-esque vocals with their hazy take on post-punk that’s equal parts Joy Division and the Jesus and Mary Chain. 
But what the band lacks in originality it makes up for in consistency, and their guitar-driven sound is twin parts jangle and gloom. 
While former Crystal Stilt Frankie Rose has gone on to a fairly successful solo career, the rest of the band has continued to release well-reviewed records under the famed indie label Slumberland. 
Crystal Stilts’ live shows have been described as less-than-friendly affairs, so don’t expect a ton of love from the band. However, the Rock and Roll Hotel’s dark, cavernous aesthetic is the closest the band will ever come to playing in a garage again, providing the perfect compliment to Crystal Stilts’ hazy sound.
Supporting Crystal Stilts on Saturday night was Widowspeak, who were just in town February playing with another former Frankie Rose project, Dum Dum Girls. 
The quartet may only have one full-length album under their belt, but their shoegazy sound, complete with dreamy female vocals and sparse melodies, is just as developed as the night’s headliners. 
Tickets are still on sale for the show, so come early for Widowspeak and bring some extra earplugs.

After seven years of pretension-free indie rock, Plants and Animals have grown comfortable in their classic-rock influenced sound and amassed a small but dedicated following. 
Unfortunately, their set at the Red Palace on April 6 was a lot like the majority of the crowd: buttoned up and wearing dad jeans.
There were no glaring problems with the set — the band was on point throughout the night — the sound was just a little too forgettable in the crowded non-hipster side of indie rock. The band’s consistently upbeat Kings of Leon-meets-Weezer sound was well-executed, but unfortunately feels repetitive and formulaic. 
When the band broke from this formula and kicked a song into a loud, messy double-time at the end of several songs, it was the brightest points of the concert. 
But just as the band reached Who levels of destructive, noisy madness, they slowed it down again and snuffed out the spark of brilliance that was there. 
Most of these moments of cutting loose came toward the end of songs as a saving grace for what was otherwise the closest that indie rock can get to dad rock. 	
However, the band was able to keep the energy of these moments up for one song, their 2010 single “The Mama Papa,” during which the band was visibly more energetic, moving around more on stage and creating a heavier, more ambitious sound. This song offered a glimpse into the largely untapped potential of Plants and Animals, with Wings-like guitar riffs and Tom Petty vocals combining to create a song that sounds like a southern-rock influenced LA punk song. 
Had they been able to keep up the energy of this song for the entire concert, it would have been a great show. Instead it was a mostly forgettable show with a few moments of greatness.
The most forgettable moments of the show were the slower songs, which is good because they weren’t particularly good either. 
Lead singer Nicolas Basque, though great at belting out a classic-rock chorus, does not have the crooning ability to buoy the several slowed-down acoustic songs that the band played. 
If anything, these songs, far from being moving or folksy, just made the higher energy moments seem better. Guitar player Warren Spicer offered some redemption for these songs with well-placed reedy and minimalist guitar riffs that carried the rest of the band. 
To their mostly older fans, Plants and Animals seemed to deliver just what they were looking for. But for anybody else, Plants and Animals sound felt a little underwhelming.

A group of School of Communication students are collaborating with The Washington Post to publish stories on under-covered ethnic and immigrant communities in D.C.
But the ongoing project, in its fourth year, is now facing funding challenges after its grant from the Surdna Foundation expired in 2011.
In the project, the Community Voice Project, AU students work with communities and nonprofits in the D.C. area, using film and prose to share their stories. Students in SOC Professor Angie Chuang’s “Race, Ethnic and Community Reporting” class publishes its news stories on Post Local.
The Post sent out story ideas in March about under-covered ethnic and immigrant communities in the D.C. area. Chuang’s students research and write the pieces and publish them on the Post Local site throughout the semester.
“These are places where the mainstream media doesn’t spend time in, unless there is a shooting or other crime,” Chuang said. “It is a disservice to only report on a community when there is bad news; you miss out the complex and real stories.” 
SOC Professors Nina Shapiro-Perl and Chuang teach the three classes participating in the project. The classes have worked with all types of organizations, from the D.C. Youth Symphony Orchestra to a nonprofit that redistributes furniture to families in need.  
More than 200 students have participated in these classes over the years, using prose or film to tell the unheard stories of people and organizations in D.C.
SOC Dean Larry Kirkman started the project in 2008 when he applied and received an initial two-year, $150,000 grant from the  Surdna Foundation, whose mission is to foster just and sustainable communities in the United States.
Chuang and Shapiro-Perl then approached Kirkman with their ideas for courses that went along with the project. Kirkman approved the classes, and they used the funding for transportation, filming supplies and digital support.
Chuang’s class also works with New American Media, a coalition of ethnic media organizations, to produce a website with all of the classes’ stories called “D.C. Intersections.” The site is updated at the end of every semester. 
NAM and Chuang’s class also co-sponsor the D.C. Metro Area Ethnic Media Awards.
“It is very important to not only recognize the small ethnic media organizations out there who are serving communities, but show that people care about the work they’re doing,” Chuang said.
Shapiro-Perl teaches a spring “Documentary Storytelling” class in which students create a film for a nonprofit.
“During my career as a filmmaker, I met many tremendous social justice organizations that were doing great work, but had no time or money to tell the public who they were,” Shapiro-Perl said.
Shapiro-Perl suggested having students help organizations produce these films as part of a course and Kirkman welcomed the idea. 
She also teaches a class every fall called “Community Documentary,” in which students help Anacostia residents, called “community partners,” create their own self-narrated stories for the Smithsonian Anacostia Community Museum.
Both classes attract juniors, seniors and graduate students from SOC, anthropology students in the College of Arts and Sciences and sometimes other AU schools, and fill up quickly, Chuang said. 
Shapiro-Perl said the students who take the class are very dedicated, and many of them end up changing their career path to jobs that involve the skills they learned in class.  
Charlene Shovic, who graduated from AU with a master’s degree in anthropology in 2011, came to AU specifically to take Shapiro-Perl’s “Documentary Storytelling” class. She now works in Hawaii, running her own video production business that uses what she learned in the class.
“I have always known there is power in storytelling, and after taking her ‘Documentary Storytelling’ class, I knew this was an area I wanted to work in,” Shovic said.
Now that CVP’s Surdna Foundation grant expired, the project has been looking for new sources of funding to keep it alive. They have secured enough funding to teach the courses next academic year.
“There are so many aspects to this project: amplifying unheard voices in our community; connecting students and community members; connecting people to people across social boundaries of class, race, ethnicity, geography, sexual orientation; community service; training a new generation of social documentarians, etc.,” Shapiro-Perl said. “It is painful to think about it ending.”

Mary Graydon Center is abuzz with several new tenants this semester.
The School of International Service and the Office of Sustainability established four beehives in one of the open-air atriums in MGC at the end of March. 
SIS Assistant Dean of Faculty and Administration Joe Clapper and SIS Assistant Professor Eve Bratman spearheaded the project.
The MGC beehives are not the only ones hosted on campus, however. The roof of the SIS building is home to another beehive installed in spring 2011.
Bratman and other SIS faculty wanted to make the SIS building greener, and thought that adding a beehive would help. 
“Even though the building is terrifically green, we wanted to do as much as we could up to the roof, so we still hope someday there will be a green roof there.” Bratman said. “But meanwhile, we’re making it as green as we can by making beehives.” 
Building beehives on campus increases AU’s sustainability and helps on-campus plant life flourish, as bees help pollinate plants. Adding beehives on campus also helps reverse the national decline in the bee population, Bratman said. 
Bratman discovered a passion for beekeeping when she first secured a grant from the Office of Sustainability to set up hives on the roof. 
“I’ve had environmental interests since the time I was a little kid, and as part of those interests, done everything from worm composting to community gardening.” Bratman said. “So beekeeping was always something that’s been on my radar.” 
Bratman’s growing interest in the subject led to the establishment of a new not-for-credit course for the AU community in beekeeping.
The course started off as an experimental peer-driven class allowing students to teach each other about unique subjects, according to Eli McComb, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences.
There are currently 15 people enrolled in the course, Bratman said.
McComb, alongside Bratman, is hoping to establish an AU Beekeeping Club to allow more students to become involved. Bratman hopes the club will help attract more students to beekeeping.
“I could continue to be the sole beekeeper on campus, but it wouldn’t be half as much fun if there weren’t other people learning by my side,” Bratman said.
Bratman set up a hive behind Kreeger in July 2011. But it failed when all the bees died due to beetle infestations and oversaturation from the heavy rains of Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee in August and September 2011.
It was easier to secure a grant for the MGC hives, since the university already had the equipment from the Kreeger hives and the start-up costs were already covered, Bratman said. 
As a result, she was able to establish three hives in MGC.
“All of the hives, since they’re all on roofs, we don’t have any of the pest problems that we had while the hives were basically down on the ground, so signs are all very positive that these bees are doing great,” Bratman said.
Bratman and McComb hope to further expand beekeeping at AU and educate the AU community on the importance of bees.
“The bees are not killer bees,” Bratman said. “They are quite docile, and they’re also quite essential to keeping our ecosystem healthy because they’re pollinators.”

Aaron Cohen woke up to a text message around 5:30 p.m. one afternoon saying the AU College Democrats were going to host political consultant Kim Christiansen.
Cohen decided to go to the event, not thinking that anything would come of it. 
Just a few months later, with Christiansen’s help, Cohen was working on Rep. Matt Campbell’s, D-IA, congressional campaign against Rep. Steve King, R-IA.
Campbell went on to win his primary but lost the general election. 
Cohen also worked on a campaign for Francis Thicke, who later became Iowa Secretary of Agriculture. Cohen took a “stagnant operation and turned it around” by raising about $350,000 in a month.
A mere junior in the School of International Service, Cohen now works as a consultant with the objective of adding “value at the community level” to his clients.
He also is the chief communications officer of Sawmill Hollow Family Farm in Iowa, which sells jam — all without ever taking a business class.  
One thing Cohen says he misses about being on the campaign trail is the sense of purpose.
“You wake up every day with a mission,” he said.
On campus, Cohen was both the debate chair of AU Dems and the economic policy chair of the Roosevelt Institute his freshman year. 
Cohen has an air of professional friendliness. But when he needs something done he can be frank and forceful, a skill that came in handy when he was working with campaign staff. 
He says he misses some of the direct contact with the public and making good impressions on people.
“Folks know good folks when they see them,” Cohen said.
When it comes to management, Cohen “loves to talk to interns about strategy in a dialogue” rather than a lecture.
He also feels that if an employee really understands why they are doing something, they are more likely to be invested in the task they are completing. For this reason he admires Sally Shelton-Colby, diplomat-in-residence at AU, because she takes the time to discuss the “why” behind any work she assigns.
In terms of politics, Cohen doesn’t like to be “pinned down” by traditional political labels.  
“I’m a Democrat, but [I’m for] a small and effective government,” Cohen said.
He went on to say that the regulatory system is more difficult for small businesses to maneuver in than big businesses, which stifles growth. 
“I am particularly passionate about growing rural communities,” because he grew up in a small community in Kentucky, “America’s heartland.” (Cohen says he is a fan of the Kentucky Wildcats and has been since before they were popular.)
He is fiscally conservative but socially liberal and insists he is more of a populist than a libertarian.
“I think Republicans have monopolized talking about values, and I hate that because I love talking about why I love America,” he said. 
Cohen is for gay rights and “anti-abortion, pro-choice.” 
“I would never judge anyone,” he said. “I just have a problem with it personally.” 
Whether he is talking about his success in business or as a political consultant, Cohen says, the key to success is knowing how to work with people.
“It’s all organizational theory,” he said.

Fists are unclenched, muscles are relaxed and all the adrenaline associated with baseball’s opening weekend has been released.  
Teams that dominated this weekend are able to unwind and look forward to a long, 162-game season, while others who struggled are still begging for that first big hit.  
Let’s relive all of the excitement that was MLB Opening Week 2012.  
Jered Weaver in Cy Young form, C.C. and Lincecum rocked 
If he keeps it up, Weaver will be awarded the American League Cy Young this year. I’m saying it now. 
The Angel ace struck out 10 batters in a dominant start against the Kansas City Royals Friday night, further proving that if Justin Verlander weren’t around last year, Weaver would’ve taken home the ultimate pitcher’s prize. Combined with the offensive depth the Angels acquired in the Albert Pujols signing, the right-hander can count on his teammates to score runs.
Weaver’s knack for hiding the ball comes from his sneaky windup, where he practically steps in the third base dugout before coming across his body. That has to be distracting for any batter.  
Continuing on the West Coast, Tim Lincecum was rocked for five runs in 5.1 innings against Arizona. The two-time National League Cy Young Award winner opened 2012 in un-Lincecum-like form, surrendering three runs in the first before being charged with two in the fifth. 
Across the country, Carlos Pena returned to Tampa Bay and wreaked havoc at Tropicana Field in the opener, roughing up both C.C. Sabathia and Mariano Rivera. Pena pounded a grand slam in the first inning, and followed that up with a game-winning RBI single off Rivera in the ninth.  The Rays must be eternally grateful they brought him back this season.  
But the fact that the Rays celebrated on the field like they had just won the World Series must have been too much for Yankees fans to handle. Come on guys, it’s the first game of the season. Chill out. 
It’s all about the AL West
The Boston-New York rivalry has disappointed many baseball fans the past few years. The two teams seem subpar, a little out of it and less passionate. I guess if you were chowing down on chicken wings and beer in the dugout, as some of the Red Sox admitted to last season, you wouldn’t care much about the season’s outcome.  
Now, the Angels-Rangers matchup is something to get excited about. The two teams are evenly matched, with Texas having a more solid bullpen. 
But the offenses of both teams were silenced early this weekend. The Angels are struggling to hit off the Royals. The Royals! While both teams boast dominant starting pitching, pitchers can’t score runs. Perhaps both teams should have conversations with the Phillies.  
But enough of the negativity, only two games have been played after all. The element of surprise about Yu Darvish’s first start for the Rangers should keep fans on the edge of their seats for a bit.  
Ozzie Guillen loves Fidel Castro and Strasburg’s first start
The Miami Marlins’ manager told Time magazine he loves the Cuban dictator, just two days after admitting to the press that he likes to get drunk after every game. Guillen subsequently apologized, but he needs to learn to keep a lid on it, as the Marlins will be in the spotlight this season.  
Meanwhile, Washington pitching prodigy Stephen Strasburg produced a stellar Opening Day start at Wrigley Field. He gave up just one earned run and struck out five in a 2-1 win, producing a type of performance Nats fans hope to see throughout the season.

Synetic Theater broke the mold for the eighth time with its production of “The Taming of the Shrew” in its Silent Shakespeare series.
Expectations were high in the house since the recent Helen Hayes nominations revealed that Synetic’s recent production of “King Lear,” also a part of the “Silent Shakespeare” series, gained the physical theater an incredible 15 nominations. 
This was no traditional Elizabethan production of Shakespeare’s “The Taming of the Shrew.” The entire story revolves around a celebrity family in contemporary Los Angeles, and how the father Baptista (Hector Reynoso) tries to marry off his eldest daughter Katherine (Irina Tsikurishvili). 
When younger daughter Bianca (Irina Kavsadze) finds her love in Lucentio (Scott Brown) at the Victoria’s Secret-inspired fashion show where Katherine also happens to meet Petruchio (Ryan Sellers), the romantic comedy spirals from there. 
“The Taming of the Shrew” is comedy that faces no limitation of time or location. This production also breaks the boundaries of communicating this complicated love story without a single spoken word. 
The entire 90-minute performance is filled with dynamic dances and acrobatics all to the underscoring of lively music, some original to this production created under the sound design of Paata Tsikurishvili and Irakli Kavsadze.
The design of the show is breathtaking. The set consists of five large flats that were different textures on one side that caught the light, and the other side had beautiful paintings of them. 
The simple design by Anastasia Simes really allows the action to speak for itself. Simes also designed the extravagant costumes that certainly supported the overly sexualized Hollywood aesthetic of the show.
The entire cast communicated the plot effectively. The only aspect of the story that may have been missed by someone not already familiar with the plot was the defined roles of all of the minor characters. 
They all seemed to be in every scene and were the chorus in several of the large scenes, while in the traditional version they would be more minor roles.
It was an incredible ensemble performance which also justifies the frequent use of the minor roles of the show.  This is one thing Synetic is known for and has won several Helen Hayes awards for having a strong ensemble.
The principle characters were also incredible in their roles. Irina Tsikurishvili, who is a cofounder of Synetic Theater and the resident choreographer, was a dynamic Katherine. 
The only complaint that could be made about her performance is that she is on the verge of being too old for the role of Katherine. 
Katherine is the oldest daughter and, in respect to tradition, should be married already, but it is not part of the plot that she is on her way to becoming an old maid. However, if one just looked at how Tsikurishvili moved, her age would not be a question.
The show was quite enjoyable. Synetic always provides a nontraditional theater experience and with the “Silent Shakespeare” series they allow their audiences to take in a variety of Shakespeare’s work in the least Shakespearean way possible. 
“The Taming of the Shrew” will be running at the Lansburgh Theatre through April 22.

The line “I coulda been a contender” is arguably more famous than its source material. With the exception of a few memorable quotes, Budd Schulberg’s script for the Oscar-winning film, “On the Waterfront” hasn’t aged well, but the American Century Theater adaptation works with it creatively. They skillfully play up the evocative elements while toning down the clichés, and the result is a generic but satisfying drama.
Schulberg drew inspiration for “On the Waterfront” from a series of Pulitzer Prize-winning articles published in The New York Sun in 1949. The stories detail the regular murders of New Jersey longshoremen at the hands of a brutal union boss, a topic Schulberg shrewdly recognized as being ripe for Hollywood. 
The traditional good-versus-evil plot is grounded in gritty reality, but the angelic hero Terry Malloy seems to be composed more of fiction than fact. Fueled by the fiery rhetoric of a young priest, Malloy and his fellow longshoremen dare to investigate the murders, with predictably tragic consequences.
This story evolved through several forms: first journalism, then film and now it has expanded into three dimensions.
In exchange for the baroque industrial scaffolds that loom in the settings of the film version, the theater production wisely aims for minimalism. The small, square stage has two stories: The first level doubles as the dock and the floor of a church, and Terry Malloy keeps his prized messenger pigeons on the second level. Pitch black envelopes the set on all sides.
The narrow spotlight focuses entirely on the actors, and they rise to the occasion. 
Jack Powers’s portrayal of the mild and well-intentioned Malloy is daringly un-ironic. Malloy’s romantic interest, Edie, might have fallen victim to banality if not for Caitlin Shea’s evocative portrayal. Even though her role gradually loses centrality, she manages to maintain a nuanced presence over the course of the entire play. 
Bruce Rauscher rounds out the solid cast, playing the belligerent union boss and a timid priest. He slips into both roles effortlessly, using similar loose-limbed gestures to suggest the resignation of the priest and the swaggering volatility of the villain. 
The few weaknesses of the play stem from the written material, but the creators work hard to make it relevant to the lives of modern audiences. The information booklet emphasizes the play’s current political implications, and the directors update the dialogue with modern slang, which jars with the actors’ stylized 1940s cadence. The result of these compromises comes off as an awkward combination of the film noir era and “The Wire.”
But thematic decisions such as these are marginal details in a solid production. With the support of a strong cast, the creators work around the inbuilt obstacles of “On the Waterfront” with commendable results.

Last week, Public Safety removed from the Quad a Free Speech Wall set up by AU Students for Liberty. 
While Student Activities has apologized that no one was notified and that there was no due process involved in the removal of this pre-approved display, it has also been stated that they support the removal and would have done the same. Offensive and libelous content was cited. 
We are now being asked to “staff” the wall if we put it back up and “guide discourse” to prevent this sort of thing. This is not the point of free speech.
I felt compelled to share a piece on political correctness. 
The reason that Public Safety took the action they did, in my opinion, is partially due to the culture of political correctness and hostility to free speech that exists on this campus. 
This is the line the administration sticks to and that students tend to accept. This is the standard that leads to the “destroy first, ask questions later” action taken by Public Safety. 
Restrictive and stifling commitment to political correctness is dangerous and antithetical to freedom. Partially, because it leads to this sort of action. But also for the following reasons.
Political correctness is an issue that college students like to gripe about (at least when it affects them) but doesn’t seem to actually harm anyone. So what’s the trouble in being considerate of others? 
Well, despite popular belief, and perhaps to the pleasant surprise of the inarticulate griper, I think there is a very real case to be made for the harms of political correctness. Especially when it is valued above other considerations or at the expense of other considerations of expression on campus.
We can clearly identify who is hurt when we are not politically correct. The loudly offended make it clearly known that their feelings have been injured by careless words. But who, exactly, benefits from this kind of speech? And who is hurt when it’s restricted? 
As I mentioned, we all realize on some instinctual level that we are being restricted, and it is uncomfortable. That is, the claim that political correctness is an unchallengeable good cannot be true. 
The issue is a fundamental one. Why should we speak our minds? Why should we not only allow but also invite discomfort at expressions and ideas? 
I see two important facets being lost to discussions. One is the challenging and broadening of the collective understanding of correctness. The other is of addressing internal feelings, thoughts, biases and intentions and challenging these as well. 
A culture of restriction, let alone a solid regulation against certain types of speech and expressions, conditions us not to speak our mind and to conform to popular opinion without challenging it. This means that whoever is setting the terms for what is correct and what isn’t (be it those in power, the majority or the loudest, most offended faction) has a monopoly on what is considered offensive. 
In the interest of erring on the side of expression, we should avoid this outcome. 
Part of the purpose of college life is to challenge what is accepted both in the main and by the individual. If we never say anything that offends anyone, how can we ever challenge those mainstream sensibilities? 
I’m sure that the things a civil rights activist would say offended many in the Jim Crow South. Conversely, when an individual holds beliefs that we would hope would be challenged, keeping these to themselves prevents the issue ever being fully addressed. The silent racist is still racist. They just never have to hear the arguments against their views. 
In the interest in challenging ourselves and our society, I think we must always err on the side of expression. Regimes of predetermined correctness and even particularly stifling cultures in the same vein prevent this from being the case and undermine our ability to learn and change.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continued its search for buried WWI-era military materials on AU’s campus over spring break, but this latest effort in the 19-year investigation yielded no results.
The Corps installed a new well in front of Kreeger Hall to test the groundwater outside the building, according to an April 3 email update from the Spring Valley Community Outreach Team.
The Corps is testing groundwater to determine whether the perchlorate samples found at AU and Sibley Memorial Hospital are from the same source, according to the email.
This is the most recent testing the Corps has done. However, the Corps has also been monitoring groundwater for levels of perchlorate, a chemical found in munitions and other materials used by the Army, since its discovery on campus in 2004, The Eagle previously reported.
The Corps also dug four trenches in the Kreeger parking lot and roadway to investigate whether “anomalies,” or metallic objects previously used by the Army, were buried there, according to the Corps’ presentation at the March 13 Restoration Advisory Board meeting.
No anomalies were found, only construction debris and litter such as Coke bottles, according to the Spring Valley Community Outreach Team.
After the investigations, the trenches were repaved, and the Kreeger parking lot was reopened for use.
The entire process took place over spring break, as requested by AU, to reduce any disruptions for students.
This was the last scheduled search for anomalies in the Spring Valley project area, according to the Corps’ presentation.
Two anomalies previously discovered were demolished Feb. 17, the Corps reported.
The Corps discovered the two 75 mm rounds about a mile north of AU’s campus in the Dalecarlia Woods in January 2011, and detonated them in a controlled detonation chamber on federal property at the edge of the Dalecarlia Reservoir Grounds.
The chamber is designed to safely destroy munitions by detonating them, Project Manager Todd Beckwith said.
“The [chamber] structure is comprised of two thick steel boxes, one inside the other, separated by 28 tons of sand,” according to the Army’s news release.
The Corps is also awaiting the final approval of its plan to demolish the AU-owned house at 4825 Glenbrook Rd. The Corps expects to have the necessary signatures of Army officials this month.
A plan detailing how the Corps will clean up the property after the house’s removal will be tentatively finalized in May, according to the Spring Valley Community Outreach Team.
The next RAB meeting is scheduled for April 10 at 7 p.m. in St. David’s Episcopal Church, 5150 Macomb St. NW. The event is open to the public.
