In the overcrowded online-focused first person shooter market, rebooting a 1993 strategy classic as a FPS sounds like a financially safe but artistically worthless move. But Starbreeze’s “Syndicate” manages to overcome its dubious inception with exemplary co-op multiplayer, despite a terrible single-player campaign.
In the second half of the 21st century, neural-chip technology has made hegemonic corporations the new nation-states, employing hardened agents for corporate espionage. These agents can use their neural technology to hack into both computers and people, literally controlling their minds through technology. As one of these agents, the player gets to use these powers, called “breaches,” to force enemies to kill themselves or fight for the player. You spend the game fighting the security forces of rival corporations through futuristic urban environments.
The campaign disappoints with a boring, linear corridor crawl and a story so generic that even the voices of Rosario Dawson and Brian Cox can’t make it interesting. The level design borrows the usual “Call of Duty” scripted tropes without any sense of originality or excitement as the player moves through tight, uninteresting environments with little freedom.
The visuals are technically impressive but artistically average. While “Syndicate” sports a striking cyberpunk aesthetic, it’s unfortunately close to last year’s excellent “Deus Ex: Human Revolution.” But while “Deus Ex” rendered a universe overflowing with visual details that supported a well thought out narrative, “Syndicate” is all style and no substance.
But the online co-op of “Syndicate” easily outshines the campaign with inexplicably superior design. Instead of cramped environments, the more open levels feature large-scale battles where the various breaches, visceral gunplay, and a class system that encourages cooperation result in a totally different experience. The lack of a worthy story is no hindrance here.
The co-op features numerous breaches and weapons with unlockable tech trees that keep the player invested in picking up the next cool trick or creating their perfect weapon. The levels are unlocked one after another, making “Syndicate” feel like the single player-multiplayer hybrid that games like “Brink” have tried and failed to be so often before.
While the objectives eventually start to blend together, the levels are all visually distinct and the action stays tense and exciting. The difficulty is much higher than the campaign, necessitating teamwork and tactical play utilizing all the available tools at the player’s disposal.
It doesn’t make sense that half of “Syndicate” features exciting, tactical battles with an interesting sandbox of weapons and abilities only in the co-op mode. It’s too bad that the suffocating campaign sacrificed what makes the co-op so special in favor of a forgettable storyline, resulting in a game that’s half worth buying.

• @"I want to get into shape" Just do it. I'm fat and I go to the gym 4-5 times a week. Just put on your ipod or watch a movie on the TV and you won't even notice all the other people around you. Anyone here or anywhere that says anything bad sucks. It's awesome that you want to make a change.
• @"I want to get into shape" But if you do feel uncomfortable, the best times to go to the gym before 9 am when there's only old people there, between 3-5 pm since most people are in class, and between 10:30pm and midnight when most people are starting to do the homework for the next day.

An unacceptably disrespectful protest
By The AU College Republicans Executive Board
Throughout American University’s history, student groups of all affiliations have participated in the life of the university by hosting influential policy makers on campus. The acts by these students who protested Governor Brewer’s speech did not just disrespect Governor Brewer, but also the College Republicans who put on the event and the students who came to listen respectfully to Governor Brewer, regardless of whether they agreed with her. Most importantly, the students disrespected Public Safety Officers. To treat Officers who work hard to ensure AU is a safe and vibrant community with such disrespect is unacceptable.
Sadly, some students have chosen to defend the truly radical actions of the protestors, claiming that it was because we screened questions. For the multitude of protestors, there was only one question submitted by a student outside of our group, and it was on an issue that would have been addressed if the governor had been allowed to finish answering the questions. Regardless, we hope that AU students don’t believe that the proper response to not having your question heard is to shut down the event entirely.
Another argument was that Governor Brewers’ views on immigration are so extreme that she does not have a place on campus. Many AU students might fervently disagree with Governor Brewer, but 57 percent of Arizona citizens favor the controversial SB 1070, and Governor Brewer’s views are in line with the mainstream of the Republican Party. Does this mean that the College Republicans should not bring any speakers to campus who fit our values, but disagree with the prevailing campus orthodoxy? Do we really deserve to be treated unfairly because people on campus disagree with us?
This is not a general statement against protesting, which is a legitimate political tool. However, we believe that respect and basic decency call for protesting to be done in a way that allows us to continue our event. The actions of the protesters Friday night threatened the reputation of American University, threatened the way that potential future speakers view our campus and most importantly, threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus. We don’t expect everyone to agree with the policy-leaders who we bring to campus, but we do think they should be treated with respect. We hope that all students, faculty and university officials will join with us in calling for more respect for future guests on campus.

Stealing the spotlight
By Rachel Lomot
We all heard about the recent protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer.  We heard that students stood up during Brewer’s speech and began to yell.  We heard that the protesters caused Brewer to leave early.  We have heard a lot of debate about the actions taken, but have we heard anything about why students were protesting?  In the midst of all of this talk the actual issue was undermined by the method. 
Gov. Jan Brewer was invited to speak by AU College Republicans last Friday night.  It was a very controversial move to start with because of her strict, seemingly immoral, immigration stance.  There was some backlash to be expected, but not to this degree.
The extensive action taken by the protestors did bring the speech and the issue lots of press.  Gov. Brewer’s speech might have gone unnoticed without the demonstration. So the protest worked – it brought the issue to the front page.
However, students and faculty are now left debating the wrong issue. All of the previous articles in The Eagle surrounding this issue briefly mention the controversial bill itself. The articles focus on the question of respect. Was this the way to go about protesting Gov. Brewer? This is what we are left talking about – not her immigration policies.
Andrea Gonzalez, one of the protestors, disagrees. “I find it difficult to separate the issue of Brewer speaking on our campus and the action that occurred. I have not yet found a person who did not know what we were protesting against, which made our point clear: we do not want a racist bigot speaking on campus” said Gonzalez.
However, if the protest were a success, wouldn’t we see more rallied alliance in the issue of immigration? Wouldn’t AU see students writing about how the government should change immigration policy?  
Chelsea Lawrence, a Kogod student, didn’t understand the protestors’ beliefs as easily as Gonzalez explains. “I honestly didn’t know what the protest was about until a few days later when someone explained it to me,” says Lawrence. “I don’t think it was the right way to go about it.  Gov. Brewer isn’t going to change her beliefs after a bunch of students yell at her. If anything, the people who agree with her will only see how irrational the protesters were.”
The protest stimulated conversation. But when the complainers quit complaining and the defendants stop defending what will be left? I’m betting it will be the same as before, which is the wrong outcome for a protest.

Protests brewing at AU?
By Taylor Kenkel
During the 1970’s, AU’s campus served as a site of protests against both the Vietnam War and racial discrimination.  A group of students vocally rallied against the war and ignited a wave of involvement on campus after police tear gassed and arrested several for civil disobedience in May of 1970.
While tame compared to the events of forty years ago, the group of 20 students protesting a speech by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer last Friday still sparked campus controversy.
Students rallied against the Republican governor’s push for Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, the most severe piece of immigration legislation in the nation. The act, commonly known as SB 1070, makes it a misdemeanor for aliens to be in Arizona without carrying proper documentation and bans ethnic studies programs in state schools. The main rub with SB 1070 lies in a provision requiring police officers to try to determine someone’s immigration status during lawful stops, detentions and arrests— a requirement that lends disturbing legitimacy to racial profiling.  
After the law passed in 2010, protestors demonstrated in 70 different locations across the United States on May 1, rallying against the institutionalization of discrimination. Just as the nationwide protests of nearly two years ago pushed the controversial legislation into the national sphere, the protest of Governor Brewer’s on-campus speaking event sparked a buzz of online and face-to-face debates among AU students.
Some might think the protest and subsequent debate confirms the oft-repeated cliché that AU students are the most politically active in the country. The consensus among many students that the protest served as nothing more than a disruptive act of disrespect points to toleration for only “appropriate” and “civil” methods of dissent and a view of  “radical” actions as a mockery of the political system.
Accepting only mundane forms of protest and action ignores the need to work outside the system in order avoid being slammed down and silenced by influential government officials or lost in the bureaucratic maze.
Though students throw around vague calls for dialogue between the groups, the short nature of the speaking engagement and reliance on pre-screened questions effectively squashed potential for a deeper conversation and understanding from the onset.  
While college-aged kids like to think Facebook posts and angry texts amount to active protest, simple messages and whispers of disapproval only serve as documentation of controversial events.  By electing to protest the event, the group of students effectively transformed their outrage and discontent into direct involvement and action.  Tactics used by the protestors—mic checking, chanting and waving signs— represented a frustration with the inhibition of participation and the elevation of a political figure onto a higher, untouchable plane where dissent is not allowed.  The actions served as powerful demonstration of engagement, direct confrontation and consciousness-raising otherwise made impossible by the imposed constraints of the situation.
Just as students present on campus during Vietnam felt though political action through more traditional would not effectively impart their message or produce results, students protesting the speaking event believed the radical actions of Governor Brewer warranted an equally eyebrow-raising response.  The only objectionable actions the protestors could have taken include direct threats or violence—neither of which occurred at the event.
The knee-jerk condemnation of the protestors by AU students from across the political spectrum reveals a distinct phobia of controversial political engagement, and indicates just how little many value or care to act on their freedom of speech and assembly.

Karl Popper, tolerance and Jan Brewer
By Joe Gruenbaum
I first stumbled upon Karl Popper’s work studying philosophy of science, and that’s no accident—his legacy is the development of a concrete understanding of what a leap from theory to reality implies. But what does an Austrian philosopher have to do with Jan Brewer? (A lot, if we’re talking about Hayek and von Mises—but that’s for another column) Popper’s most eloquent statement is not found in the annals of some philosophy journal but in an interview on society:
“If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant,” Popper says, “if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.” Simply put, the only thing that cannot be tolerated is intolerance. 
CASJ and the Student-Workers alliance protested Brewer in response to SB 1070, passed last April, which would have encouraged racial profiling among border security officers. That portion of the bill was blocked by district judge Susan Bolton. However, a more disconcerting amendment to SB 1070 was passed a week after the bill itself; HB 2281 outlawed ethnic studies in Arizona schools and mandates illegitimate cultural imperialism. The bill outlaws any class that “advocates ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.” 
Outlawing ethnic solidarity is a weird extension of Randian individualism, atomizing humans as sociopathic actors and preventing them from finding happiness in collectivism. Without “ethnic solidarity” the civil rights movement would never have happened, historically black or minority colleges and universities would not be able to give the opportunities they give now to underrepresented groups—and every oppressed ethnic minority in history would not have been able to break the bonds of their oppressors. Ethnic solidarity is the means by which an oppressed group recognizes that oppression and comes together to stop it. Fracturing, convincing members to be “self-concerned”—to value what those who follow western individualism value—is itself a system of control, forcing disassociation, replacing a diverse ethnic identity with a harsh, western, anarcho-captilistic and singular conception of the individual. Republicans like Brewer would like to stop collective action by destroying empathy. 
Last Friday’s protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer was legitimate and necessary. Her policies and rhetoric are, by any reasonable definition of the word, intolerant. 
To the AU college republicans who believe that the protests “threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus,” that’s incredibly thick—Brewer was allowed to speak for 45 minutes, and discourse is in no danger. Because of politicians like Brewer and those that agree with her—yes, you, College Republicans—our country’s discourse is threatened by unconscionable intolerance. And Popper is right: if that kind of intolerance is allowed, it is tolerance itself that is in danger.

The collateral damage of political discourse
By Will Beaudouin
Growing up in a politically divided household, I’ve always been exposed to both ends of the political spectrum. My father—an ex-hippie who claims to have been tear-gassed multiple times in the sixties—often brags he has not once voted Republican. Meanwhile, my mother proudly voted for Bush twice and worships Ronald Reagan with an uncomfortable fervor. In short, I have absolutely no clue why they’re married. Yet while my parents’ political incongruity made discussing current events an impossibility, it did help me develop an objective perspective of politics. As I grew older, my personal beliefs began to skew much closer to those of my father, but I was still able to understand and appreciate my mother’s perspective. I like to think that I still have the ability to look at politicized situations with at least a modicum of objectivity; of course I have my own opinions, but I’ll at least make an effort to understand the rationale of those I disagree with.
It’s through this lens that I’ve been contemplating the recent regarding the mic-checking of Jan Brewer. Personally, I find Gov. Brewer detestable; I have a hard time stomaching any politician that supports racially discriminatory legislation and who engages in racially biased rhetoric. I believe that the protestors were in the right and chose to voice their dissent in a rather respectful manner. From my perspective, I see nothing wrong with what happened last Thursday. 
Yet when I take a step back, I can’t help but empathize with the College Republicans. We all know the political demographics of AU—they’re a minority here. I can’t imagine that they regularly get speakers of Gov. Brewer’s stature; if you’re a conservative at AU, this is a rare opportunity. So, with this in mind, I understand how disappointing it must have been to be a member of AU College Republicans last Thursday. Your event that—in all likelihood—wasn’t easy to organize was nothing other than a complete disaster. To have this occur in front of a woman you presumably respect must have been humiliating. To say the least, AU conservatives probably aren’t too high on their institution right now.
Am I happy that Gov. Brewer was mic-checked? Yes—fantastically so in fact. I’m having a hard time sympathizing with Gov. Brewer whatsoever. That said, it’s too bad that this display of dissent came at the expense of an innocent party. This unfortunate collateral damage has become a commonality of contemporary political discourse in the United States—and that’s a shame.

Most importantly, the students disrespected Public Safety Officers. To treat Officers who work hard to ensure AU is a safe and vibrant community with such disrespect is unacceptable.
Sadly, some students have chosen to defend the truly radical actions of the protestors, claiming that it was because we screened questions. For the multitude of protestors, there was only one question submitted by a student outside of our group, and it was on an issue that would have been addressed if the governor had been allowed to finish answering the questions. Regardless, we hope that AU students don’t believe that the proper response to not having your question heard is to shut down the event entirely.
Another argument was that Governor Brewers’ views on immigration are so extreme that she does not have a place on campus. Many AU students might fervently disagree with Governor Brewer, but 57 percent of Arizona citizens favor the controversial SB 1070, and Governor Brewer’s views are in line with the mainstream of the Republican Party. Does this mean that the College Republicans should not bring any speakers to campus who fit our values, but disagree with the prevailing campus orthodoxy? Do we really deserve to be treated unfairly because people on campus disagree with us?
This is not a general statement against protesting, which is a legitimate political tool. However, we believe that respect and basic decency call for protesting to be done in a way that allows us to continue our event. The actions of the protesters Friday night threatened the reputation of American University, threatened the way that potential future speakers view our campus and most importantly, threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus. We don’t expect everyone to agree with the policy-leaders who we bring to campus, but we do think they should be treated with respect. We hope that all students, faculty and university officials will join with us in calling for more respect for future guests on campus.

Stealing the spotlight
By Rachel Lomot
We all heard about the recent protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer.  We heard that students stood up during Brewer’s speech and began to yell.  We heard that the protesters caused Brewer to leave early.  We have heard a lot of debate about the actions taken, but have we heard anything about why students were protesting?  In the midst of all of this talk the actual issue was undermined by the method. 
Gov. Jan Brewer was invited to speak by AU College Republicans last Friday night.  It was a very controversial move to start with because of her strict, seemingly immoral, immigration stance.  There was some backlash to be expected, but not to this degree.
The extensive action taken by the protestors did bring the speech and the issue lots of press.  Gov. Brewer’s speech might have gone unnoticed without the demonstration. So the protest worked – it brought the issue to the front page.
However, students and faculty are now left debating the wrong issue. All of the previous articles in The Eagle surrounding this issue briefly mention the controversial bill itself. The articles focus on the question of respect. Was this the way to go about protesting Gov. Brewer? This is what we are left talking about – not her immigration policies.
Andrea Gonzalez, one of the protestors, disagrees. “I find it difficult to separate the issue of Brewer speaking on our campus and the action that occurred. I have not yet found a person who did not know what we were protesting against, which made our point clear: we do not want a racist bigot speaking on campus” said Gonzalez.
However, if the protest were a success, wouldn’t we see more rallied alliance in the issue of immigration? Wouldn’t AU see students writing about how the government should change immigration policy?  
Chelsea Lawrence, a Kogod student, didn’t understand the protestors’ beliefs as easily as Gonzalez explains. “I honestly didn’t know what the protest was about until a few days later when someone explained it to me,” says Lawrence. “I don’t think it was the right way to go about it.  Gov. Brewer isn’t going to change her beliefs after a bunch of students yell at her. If anything, the people who agree with her will only see how irrational the protesters were.”
The protest stimulated conversation. But when the complainers quit complaining and the defendants stop defending what will be left? I’m betting it will be the same as before, which is the wrong outcome for a protest.

Protests brewing at AU?
By Taylor Kenkel
During the 1970’s, AU’s campus served as a site of protests against both the Vietnam War and racial discrimination.  A group of students vocally rallied against the war and ignited a wave of involvement on campus after police tear gassed and arrested several for civil disobedience in May of 1970.
While tame compared to the events of forty years ago, the group of 20 students protesting a speech by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer last Friday still sparked campus controversy.
Students rallied against the Republican governor’s push for Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, the most severe piece of immigration legislation in the nation. The act, commonly known as SB 1070, makes it a misdemeanor for aliens to be in Arizona without carrying proper documentation and bans ethnic studies programs in state schools. The main rub with SB 1070 lies in a provision requiring police officers to try to determine someone’s immigration status during lawful stops, detentions and arrests— a requirement that lends disturbing legitimacy to racial profiling.  
After the law passed in 2010, protestors demonstrated in 70 different locations across the United States on May 1, rallying against the institutionalization of discrimination. Just as the nationwide protests of nearly two years ago pushed the controversial legislation into the national sphere, the protest of Governor Brewer’s on-campus speaking event sparked a buzz of online and face-to-face debates among AU students.
Some might think the protest and subsequent debate confirms the oft-repeated cliché that AU students are the most politically active in the country. The consensus among many students that the protest served as nothing more than a disruptive act of disrespect points to toleration for only “appropriate” and “civil” methods of dissent and a view of  “radical” actions as a mockery of the political system.
Accepting only mundane forms of protest and action ignores the need to work outside the system in order avoid being slammed down and silenced by influential government officials or lost in the bureaucratic maze.
Though students throw around vague calls for dialogue between the groups, the short nature of the speaking engagement and reliance on pre-screened questions effectively squashed potential for a deeper conversation and understanding from the onset.  
While college-aged kids like to think Facebook posts and angry texts amount to active protest, simple messages and whispers of disapproval only serve as documentation of controversial events.  By electing to protest the event, the group of students effectively transformed their outrage and discontent into direct involvement and action.  Tactics used by the protestors—mic checking, chanting and waving signs— represented a frustration with the inhibition of participation and the elevation of a political figure onto a higher, untouchable plane where dissent is not allowed.  The actions served as powerful demonstration of engagement, direct confrontation and consciousness-raising otherwise made impossible by the imposed constraints of the situation.
Just as students present on campus during Vietnam felt though political action through more traditional would not effectively impart their message or produce results, students protesting the speaking event believed the radical actions of Governor Brewer warranted an equally eyebrow-raising response.  The only objectionable actions the protestors could have taken include direct threats or violence—neither of which occurred at the event.
The knee-jerk condemnation of the protestors by AU students from across the political spectrum reveals a distinct phobia of controversial political engagement, and indicates just how little many value or care to act on their freedom of speech and assembly.

Karl Popper, tolerance and Jan Brewer
By Joe Gruenbaum
I first stumbled upon Karl Popper’s work studying philosophy of science, and that’s no accident—his legacy is the development of a concrete understanding of what a leap from theory to reality implies. But what does an Austrian philosopher have to do with Jan Brewer? (A lot, if we’re talking about Hayek and von Mises—but that’s for another column) Popper’s most eloquent statement is not found in the annals of some philosophy journal but in an interview on society:
“If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant,” Popper says, “if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.” Simply put, the only thing that cannot be tolerated is intolerance. 
CASJ and the Student-Workers alliance protested Brewer in response to SB 1070, passed last April, which would have encouraged racial profiling among border security officers. That portion of the bill was blocked by district judge Susan Bolton. However, a more disconcerting amendment to SB 1070 was passed a week after the bill itself; HB 2281 outlawed ethnic studies in Arizona schools and mandates illegitimate cultural imperialism. The bill outlaws any class that “advocates ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.” 
Outlawing ethnic solidarity is a weird extension of Randian individualism, atomizing humans as sociopathic actors and preventing them from finding happiness in collectivism. Without “ethnic solidarity” the civil rights movement would never have happened, historically black or minority colleges and universities would not be able to give the opportunities they give now to underrepresented groups—and every oppressed ethnic minority in history would not have been able to break the bonds of their oppressors. Ethnic solidarity is the means by which an oppressed group recognizes that oppression and comes together to stop it. Fracturing, convincing members to be “self-concerned”—to value what those who follow western individualism value—is itself a system of control, forcing disassociation, replacing a diverse ethnic identity with a harsh, western, anarcho-captilistic and singular conception of the individual. Republicans like Brewer would like to stop collective action by destroying empathy. 
Last Friday’s protest against Arizona Governor Jan Brewer was legitimate and necessary. Her policies and rhetoric are, by any reasonable definition of the word, intolerant. 
To the AU college republicans who believe that the protests “threatened the very fabric of civil discourse on campus,” that’s incredibly thick—Brewer was allowed to speak for 45 minutes, and discourse is in no danger. Because of politicians like Brewer and those that agree with her—yes, you, College Republicans—our country’s discourse is threatened by unconscionable intolerance. And Popper is right: if that kind of intolerance is allowed, it is tolerance itself that is in danger.

The collateral damage of political discourse
By Will Beaudouin
Growing up in a politically divided household, I’ve always been exposed to both ends of the political spectrum. My father—an ex-hippie who claims to have been tear-gassed multiple times in the sixties—often brags he has not once voted Republican. Meanwhile, my mother proudly voted for Bush twice and worships Ronald Reagan with an uncomfortable fervor. In short, I have absolutely no clue why they’re married. Yet while my parents’ political incongruity made discussing current events an impossibility, it did help me develop an objective perspective of politics. As I grew older, my personal beliefs began to skew much closer to those of my father, but I was still able to understand and appreciate my mother’s perspective. I like to think that I still have the ability to look at politicized situations with at least a modicum of objectivity; of course I have my own opinions, but I’ll at least make an effort to understand the rationale of those I disagree with.
It’s through this lens that I’ve been contemplating the recent regarding the mic-checking of Jan Brewer. Personally, I find Gov. Brewer detestable; I have a hard time stomaching any politician that supports racially discriminatory legislation and who engages in racially biased rhetoric. I believe that the protestors were in the right and chose to voice their dissent in a rather respectful manner. From my perspective, I see nothing wrong with what happened last Thursday. 
Yet when I take a step back, I can’t help but empathize with the College Republicans. We all know the political demographics of AU—they’re a minority here. I can’t imagine that they regularly get speakers of Gov. Brewer’s stature; if you’re a conservative at AU, this is a rare opportunity. So, with this in mind, I understand how disappointing it must have been to be a member of AU College Republicans last Thursday. Your event that—in all likelihood—wasn’t easy to organize was nothing other than a complete disaster. To have this occur in front of a woman you presumably respect must have been humiliating. To say the least, AU conservatives probably aren’t too high on their institution right now.
Am I happy that Gov. Brewer was mic-checked? Yes—fantastically so in fact. I’m having a hard time sympathizing with Gov. Brewer whatsoever. That said, it’s too bad that this display of dissent came at the expense of an innocent party. This unfortunate collateral damage has become a commonality of contemporary political discourse in the United States—and that’s a shame.

First I wanted to introduce myself, for the majority of campus who probably doesn’t know me. My name is Chris Litchfield; I am President of the AU College Democrats, and a proud AU Student. 
That is, I was until today.
Two Fridays ago, American University College Republicans invited Gov. Jan Brewer to speak on campus. In response to her presence, a number of individuals, myself included, organized a demonstration against the legislation she has implemented in Arizona. As Governor, she has supported not only SB 1070, the controversial bill that codified racial profiling into the Arizona criminal justice system, but additional legislation HB 2281, which bans the teaching of multicultural studies. 
In both instances the laws have been crafted to place immense pressure on enforcers of the law, police officers and schoolteachers and to conform to a racist ideology which vilifies Latinos as ‘illegal’ because of their immigration status. 
This culture of racism has directly affected students at AU and across the United States, and to show opposition to this culture, we disrupted her event. Controversy ensued.
However, this is really the beginning to the story, a story that while not unique to The American University, defines our campus every day. 
This academic year, organizations on campus such as the College Republicans and the Youth for Western Civilization have organized multiple events targeting certain demographics with hateful programming and consistently pushed rhetoric that targets AU students with personal attacks. 
On the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah, the AUCRs hosted a pig roast on the Quad titled the Carnivore Initiative, affirming their “right to eat meat.” I suppose this was a show of bravado against the vegetarians and vegans on campus trying to “force feed” them greens or the folks of the Jewish faith who were observing a High Holiday “too faithfully.” 
On the first day of Latino History Month, AUCRs fliered the campus with posters as part of their Anti-Che Day. While there perhaps needs to be a discussion of Che Guevara’s status in pop culture, the event was targeted too specifically to be anything less than racism and intimidation.
We are a campus that prides itself on our diversity. Many voices exist at AU, and allowing them to be heard is of the utmost importance. But there is a difference between free speech and intimidation – dialogue and hate. 
AU students on the whole vehemently oppose racism, but in practice we refuse to admit our hand in perpetuating it. It happens every day in our classrooms, dorms and apartments. But we instead blind ourselves with the next electoral race or internship on the Hill or prestigious speaker. It’s easier, and we have all done it, but we can no longer make those excuses. Not if we care about our fellow students.
I am not immune either. As College Dems President, no matter which issue we faced I tried to argue that the organization should stand by the principles of the Democratic Party to stand up for those marginalized by economic inequality, racism and gender and sexuality norms. 
And yet time and time again, be it in the call for sexual assault education on campus or in the face of targeted racism, the organization I love stood silent. It was easier to play politics, to spin the story or dodge the question, than it was to stand up for our beliefs. 
We did everything that Congress does, and then we went back to our dorms and wondered about our spineless politicians: how the agency of a woman could be rolled back, how fair access to health care be challenged and how laws limiting the freedom of Americans, be them undocumented workers in Arizona or union firefighters in Wisconsin, could be passed.
But it starts here. It starts with our own attitudes. The politicos on AU’s campus, myself included, saw it only as a game to be played and a line on a resume – not the very future of our country. We took the easy path and oppression perpetuated itself.
Our campus should be a safe place for all of our students. However, it isn’t when certain groups continually harass certain demographics of students. Gov. Jan Brewer’s unchallenged presence on campus represented this tacit approval of hate. 
After a semester of feeling abandoned by the campus at large, disrupting Jan Brewer’s speech seemed like the only way to send this message. How do we live by the beliefs we all are so quick to espouse? Paul Wellstone once said, “If we don’t fight hard enough for the things we stand for at some point we have to recognize that we don’t really stand for them.”
As of today, I am resigning from the College Democrats, an organization I dearly love but of which I am also ashamed. 
Our political lives begin today, and I know the AU community can address the real issues of oppression here on campus, if we stand by our beliefs. They run much deeper than a single banner or speech or op-ed.

Gym Class Heroes will bring their radio-friendly rock to the Tavern March 24 for the Student Union Board’s first concert of the semester. 
The show is free for students with AU IDs and limited to the first 500 students who line up on the day of the show. 
The group formed almost 10 years before they hit it big with the 2006 single “Cupid’s Chokehold,” when singer/emcee Travis McCoy and drummer Matt McGinley met (where else?) in gym class at their high school. 
After beefing up their lineup with a few more members, the band hit the Warped Tour circuit, playing small shows and festivals across the country. 
Along the way, Gym Class Heroes attracted the attention of former Fall Out Boy and scene golden boy Pete Wentz, who signed them to his label Decaydence Records. 
Wentz’s Fall Out Boy bandmate Patrick Stump produced the band’s breakthrough album, “As Cruel As School Children.” Stump also lent his vocals to what would become the group’s biggest hit of their career, the Supertramp-sampling radio hit “Cupid’s Chokehold.” 
On the success of “As Cruel As School Children,” Gym Class Heroes rose from scruffy Bamboozle upstarts to rising stars, and McCoy in particular gained visibility as the band’s high-profile frontman, dating Katy Perry and appearing on the “Snakes on a Plane” soundtrack. 
The band disbanded for a few years for the members to pursue their own projects, but reunited last year to make “The Papercut Chronicles II,” which yielded the popular single “Stereo Love” featuring Maroon 5’s Adam Levine. 
If you loved We the Kings last semester, make sure to check out fellow Warped Tour alums Gym Class Heroes in the Tavern March 24.

AU’s chapter of STAND protested at the Syrian Embassy March 4 over the country’s ongoing human rights abuses. STAND is a nationwide, student-run organization dedicated to fighting genocide and mass atrocities.
About a dozen AU students marched from the Dupont Circle Metro to the Wyoming Avenue embassy to put pressure on the Bashar-al Assad regime and to raise awareness about the current situation in Syria. 
“With the recent crackdown in Homs, it’s necessary for us to speak up and be a voice for the voiceless,” said Co-President of STAND Cassie Wiegmann, a sophomore in the School of International Service.
Students protested at the embassy and during the nearly one-mile walk to and from the Dupont Circle Metro stop. They shouted slogans such as “Hey hey, ho ho, the Assad regime has got to go!” as bystanders shopping at the farmer’s market and sipping coffee outside Starbucks cheered them on.
A police officer on duty stood outside the Syrian embassy, but did not act against the protestors. 
Thaddeus Maine, a freshman in the Kogod School of Business, came out to protest for the cause although he is not a member of STAND.
“I think it’s going to energize some of the students at American University more to get more involved and find more ways of supporting the Syrian revolution,” he said. “I also think that it’s quite possible we’ll have an effect on the people we pass by who see that this is still going on, that this wasn’t something that ended with Libya.”
While the overall tone was hopeful, the protesters acknowledged the difficulty involved in creating change in Syria. 
“It’s true that maybe we as students do not have too much leverage over the Assad regime directly, but even just raising more awareness within our school, within the community, about what’s going on helps to hold him accountable, even just locally,” Wiegmann said.
During the chant, “What do we want? Peace in Syria! When do we want it? Now!”,  a few protesters replaced the “Now!” with “a politically viable timeframe,” in a nod to the complicated nature of the Syrian conflict.
The group lobbied on the Hill last year for passage of the Syrian Human Rights Accountability Act, said STAND Co-President Aaron Alberico, a senior in the School of Public Affairs. The act, which would impose further sanctions on Syria in response to human rights abuses, is still pending. The group lobbied by visiting various Senate members in their offices.
Alberico said STAND wants “heightened sanctions on international firms, especially Russian technology and transport firms, that are providing tacit or direct support to atrocities in Syria, as well as a more forceful, sustained effort to bolster moderate players within Syria.”
Many of the protesters who participated in STAND’s March 4 demonstration will continue to show their support for the Syrian people by attending an Amnesty International candlelight vigil at the Syrian Embassy March 6 from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m.

While some of your friends may be heading back home for spring break, going on an alternative break or living it up in [insert tropical destination here], some of us (myself included) are stuck in the nation’s capital next week. 
Instead of being down in the dumps, get excited for five whole days of free time to explore everywhere in D.C. that you have not had the time to take advantage of this semester. By following this must-do guide, you can make this week one of your best spring breaks.
Try a New Bite

With TDR closed during spring break, take this as an opportunity for a culinary expedition into D.C.’s restaurant scene. Try Shophouse, Chipotle’s new Southeast Asian street food concept store. (The banh mi with chicken/pork meatballs is out of this world.) 
If you’re in the mood for a fancy dinner, make reservations for Founding Farmers, a nationally renowned restaurant that strives to bring the best locally sourced products to be incorporated into their menu. Be sure to order their Popcorn of the Day. 
For our animal lovers, try Sticky Fingers Bakery, a vegan bakery in Columbia Heights whose cupcakes have won Food Network’s show “Cupcake Wars” not once, but twice. Animal friendly AND delicious? Win.
Fun Fact Finding
Maybe you already have a favorite museum after exploring D.C. during Welcome Week or prior visits to the city (mine is the Museum of Natural History), but during this spring break, how about showing the lesser-known museums some love? 
Try the Postal Museum with its insanely large collection of stamps, or the American Art Museum to see an original Georgia O’Keefe or the Annie Leibovitz exhibit before it closes. 
For information on these museums, visit  www.si.edu/Museums
Biking and Bagels

One of the most beautiful and well-maintained bike trails runs right near AU’s campus: the Capital Crescent Trail. This trail runs from Georgetown to Bethesda and is open to runners, bikers and rollerbladers. The closest trail entrance for AU students is at the end of Arizona Avenue and goes for six miles before reaching lovely downtown Bethesda. 
After sweating through that bike ride (or run or rollerblading session), treat yourself to a Georgetown cupcake or a Bethesda Bagel. You’ve earned it.
For more information on the Capital Crescent Trail, visit www.cctrail.org.
Turn a New Page

For the students looking for a more mellow break, try searching D.C.’s fantastic bookstores for literary work to devour during your free, albeit limited, time this spring break. Student favorites include Kramerbooks & Afterwords Café in Dupont Circle, Barnes & Noble in Georgetown or Busboys & Poets in U Street. 
Whether it’s rereading an old favorite, trying out a suggestion from a friend or reading “Hunger Games” before the movie comes out later this month, kick back and relax with a good book over your spring break.

Around this time last year, I wrote that with some luck, the Washington Nationals could compete for a playoff spot in a few years. 
I was wrong. 
With upgrades to the starting rotation and an ultra-talented young outfielder ready to come up, it’s conceivable that the Nats could make the playoffs this season.
The Nationals finished a game under .500 last season, with a rotation consisting mostly of pitchers who, at best, would be fourth or fifth starters on playoff teams. As a general rule, if Livan Hernandez is a regular in your rotation, you’re not making the playoffs.
Well, Livo is gone, as is Jason Marquis, who is basically a slightly less terrible Livan Hernandez. Replacing them will be Gio Gonzalez, who the team received from the Oakland Athletics in return for four prospects, and Edwin Jackson, who the team miraculously signed to a one-year deal.
Gonzalez made his first all-star appearance in 2011, winning 16 games with a 3.12 ERA. While he ranked ninth in the American League in strikeouts, Gonzalez led the MLB in walks. He has the potential to be dominant, but also has the potential to get himself into trouble. For a pitcher who will not be asked to be the ace of the staff, Gonzalez is well worth that risk.
As for Jackson, a pitcher who seems to be on a new team every year, what you see is what you get. 
In 12 starts with the St. Louis Cardinals last season, Jackson posted a 3.58 ERA. If the Nats can get that from a guy who is expected to be a third or fourth starter, they should be very pleased.
Washington’s rotation appears to be one of the best in the NL, with Jordan Zimmermann, Gonzalez, Jackson and whoever wins the fifth starter spot between John Lannan and Chien-Ming Wang. Ah, right, there’s also this Strasburg guy.
The Nationals offense should see an upgrade at some point this season as well. There’s a certain outfielder you might have heard something about. His name is Bryce Harper. 
If they call him up, they can move right fielder Jayson Werth to center and Michael Morse to left, if first baseman Adam LaRoche comes back healthy after having surgery on his left shoulder last season. 
Seeing how last year’s team had an outfield of Werth, Roger Bernadina/Rick Ankiel and a left field platoon of Laynce Nix and Jerry Hairston Jr., this would be a major improvement. 
You also have to believe that Werth will not be as terrible this season. 
While he’s certainly beginning the declining stages of his career, players do not often drop 60 points in batting average in just one season.
I am not saying the Nationals will make the postseason. There are still many question marks. They have a below-average shortstop in Ian Desmond, both offensively and defensively. While second baseman Danny Espinosa had a surprisingly good rookie campaign, he must continue to get better at hitting righties. And LaRoche’s health is no guarantee.
The odds are that the Nats still won’t make the playoffs this year, but with major rotation upgrades and a big bat already in the organization waiting for his time, October baseball is a definite possibility in D.C.

Today@AU is getting a technological makeover. 
The new format will still be sent out in an email and will be viewable online. The look will be similar to the old version, but the technology will be Web-based instead of email-based. 
The redesign will launch March 9.
“This is a workflow that’s more efficient and streamlined,” Maralee Csellar said, associate director of Media Relations.
Submitters will now be able to choose a target audience from students, alumni, parents, faculty, staff or all, Director of Web Communications Barbara Emshwiller said, who works for University Communications and Marketing. 
Users will see the announcements that are most relevant to them when they log onto their my.AU portal. All Today@AU announcements were previously viewable to everyone.
People will still be able to view all of the announcements by clicking the “digest” button on the left-hand navigation bar in the portal.  
Submitters will also be able to request that their announcements run for up to seven days, according to the memo.
Other changes in the new system include: the option to submit an announcement that targets a specific part of the AU community, longer posting time frames and the option to view announcements from previous days, according a March 2 memorandum from UCM and the Office of Information Technology.
The submission form has also changed, including an addition of dropdown menus to determine the announcement’s category to make the approval process more streamlined and further specify to whom each announcement is directed.
The current process for creating a Today@AU entry includes submitting an announcement through my.AU, which is then sent to UCM for approval. E-News Coordinator for University Publications Suzanne Bechamps edits and assembles the announcements into the email that is delivered to the AU community each morning.
“It’s been like this for 10 years,” Emshwiller said. “It’s somewhat of an outdated tool.”
Daily Today@AU emails will continue to be sent out to the entire AU community until the implementation of a system that will let one choose to opt in or out of a Today@AU RSS feed, according to the memo.  
“We’re going to continue to push it out through email as well,” Emshwiller said.
March 2 was the last day to submit Today@AU’s before the relaunch, and March 5 was the last day of the old Today@AU format. There will be no Today@AU’s from March 6-8 until the new format goes live March 9.
“I think the decision to make it an Web-based platform is a really good idea,” said Peter Namie, a sophomore in the School of International Studies. 
Other students expressed a similar sentiment.
“I’ve had trouble submitting announcements in the past so I’m glad they’re making it easier and that I will be able to track the progress of my announcements online,” said Nellie Mitchell, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences.
