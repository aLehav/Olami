A classic tale got a modern twist during a performance of “A Report to an Academy” at the Czech Embassy on Sep. 9. The play features trained stage actor Drew Valins as Red Peter in a comedic piece that relays the story of his previous life as an ape.
The play focuses on Peter, who started as a monkey before being forced to become a man after being taken into captivity by humans. He even mentions that he became human because it was “the only way out,” which refers to the harsh treatment that he endured when in captivity.
The play was full of laughs with no dull parts, and the actors interacted with the audience. One scene in the piece that caught the audience’s attention was  when Peter’s assistant brings him a banana to eat. Peter takes a bite from the banana and describes it as tasting like “New Jersey.”
Another scene the audience loved was during the last five minutes, when the narrator answered questions from the audience. One audience member asked Peter if he sees a doctor or a veterinarian.
The play is a satirical view on how humanity views freedom as Peter raises questions about what freedom really means by demonizing human norms and standards.
The play is part of the Czech Embassy’s Mutual Inspiration Festival from Sept. 3- Oct. 31. The festival will explore the theme of Kakfa with various art exhibitions, performances and events.

Eagle columnist Shelby Ostergaard has written an eloquent plea for AU to divest from its energy stocks (Divestment necessary for AU’s future, April 18 Eagle), but it rests on two assumptions, one unproven and the other incorrect. First, Ostergaard claims that if energy companies “burn all the oil they currently have, the temperature of the world will go up six degrees.” Then she reports that “every AU student has had, in at least one class, a discussion about climate change and the havoc that oil drilling is imposing on our planet.” 
In her first assumption, Ostergaard is simply repeating what climate modelers call “scenarios,” not even predictions, that occur when computers are run for a hundred years forward using the opaque models that have been “tuned” to replicate temperatures over the past 100 years. As someone who has guided students through the models and statistics of climate change here at AU for the past decade, I can tell your readers that the models, while fascinating in their construction, are in their infancy, both in looking backwards and in looking forwards. They certainly have misfired badly over the past 15 years, predicting one of those degrees of temperature rise but seeing, in reality, absolute zero. 
In her second assumption, Ostergaard appears to misunderstand the nature of instruction. Of course we professors introduce issues relating to claims of “climate change” but not to impose on our students a belief that oil drilling creates “havoc.” We certainly hope that students will form an opinion, based on the way we have taught them to analyze evidence for themselves, about whether it was more likely natural fluctuation or industrial gas that caused the one degree rise in temperature from 1860 to 2000, and whether that one degree rise has led to havoc in hurricanes, droughts and sea level rise. But the data are weak on all of these questions, and it is not our job to make those judgments for them. Similarly, the University as a whole is not able to decide these difficult and uncertain scientific questions, and so should not be choosing stocks on the basis of allegations of “climate change.” The same holds true for hydraulic “fracking,” to which Ostergaard is so opposed. The trade-offs between the environmental risks and the economic payoffs are many and varied, and should be decided by elected politicians, not appointed academics. 
As someone who also teaches African politics, I would argue that even if the scariest climate change scenarios come true, there is a strong moral argument for not applying divestment to energy companies working in Africa. I am a great believer in divestment as a tactic in achieving social justice. I worked on the anti-apartheid divestment campaign both in college and as a staffer in Congress. But this time, divestment will harm, not help, Africans. 
A successful divestment campaign would be a death sentence for African economic development and millions of Africans. Like many other areas in the developing world, Africa has not achieved the carbon-based industrialization that has boosted education, comfort, income and life expectancy to record levels in the developed world. Even if Africa did make the leap, it would still account for only about 5 percent of global emissions. America’s per person emissions are 20 times higher. 
African economic development is being derailed by a lack of reliable consumer and industrial electricity. According to the World Bank, only 24 percent of Africans have access to electricity, which is being denied them on the basis of the supposed environmental dangers of electricity.  The rest must resort to burning dung and wood in their houses and huts, leading to horrific rates of lung and heart disease.
The typical African business loses power 56 days each year, severely constraining investment and output in commerce, agriculture, education and industry. Growth suffers, and because wealth allows people to live healthily, so does life expectancy. Energy poverty is stunting the sort of economic growth that Africa needs if it is to move from 59 years of life expectancy to the 79 that China has achieved through 20 years of economic growth fueled by intense, government-backed promotion of carbon-based electrical capacity. With almost a billion Africans alive today, that is about 20 billion years of life lost. 
As it was under apartheid, so it is for energy now: it is for the Africans, not the West, to decide.  They wanted freedom then, and they want reliable electricity now. There is a right to development just like there is a right to democracy. Let’s listen to Africans’ voices as they call for 100 percent access to electricity. Let’s envision the children sitting in their huts as deadly wood smoke swirls around them, with the fire too dim for them to read their homework assignments. Please, AU, let’s divest from the call for energy divestment.

The Eagles got back on the winning track by dominating the Howard Bison by a score of 3-0 on Sept. 10.  
From the opening whistle, the Eagles took control of the game in all aspects. Senior forward Lindsey Muri scored two goals for the Eagles, while junior forward Kelly Donovan put one in the back net as well as assisted on both of Muri’s goals. 
“To score three goals and to see Kelly and Lindsay have that partnership up top has been really good” second-year head coach Anabel Hering said. “We’ve been struggling with keeping consistent forwards, and I think now we have a little bit more consistency up top which is awesome.”
The scoring opened in the 14th minute when Donovan’s cross from outside the box fell into Muri’s feet, and she buried the goal from a yard away. Senior defender Michaela Cowgill also assisted on the play.
Four minutes later, Donovan almost scored, but a fantastic save from the Bisons (0-4-1) goalkeeper Kyra Dickinson kept the Eagles (3-4-0, 0-0-0 PL) from doubling the score in the first 20 minutes of the game. Going into halftime, AU led 1-0.
The Eagles experienced great success as a result of their even strength in every position. In the first half, five substitutions were made, but the changes did not impact their strong presence. 
“There’s no dropoff. When we put a sub in you see the same intensity as the starters and that breaks teams down,” Hering said. 
The Eagles picked up right where they left off at the start of the second half, scoring just 2 minutes in. This time, Muri crossed the ball in the box to Donovan, who slammed it home from four yards away. As well as Muri, senior midfielder Nicole Paviglionite assisted on the play. The quick strike from the Eagles deflated any hope of a Howard comeback. 
Muri and Donovan linked up for the Eagles third and final goal in the 68th minute. Donovan’s dazzling runs proved to be a thorn in the left side of the Howard defense, as this time she sprinted past the defense, drew the keeper from her goal, chipped it over her head for Muri to finish the goal from point blank range. 
Howard had a little bit more of the ball in the second half but never really concerned the rock-solid Eagle defense. Senior goalkeeper Charlene Belanger was only called on to make two saves, while the Howard keeper Dickinson was forced to make save. 
The Eagles dominated throughout, drawing seven corner kicks to Howard’s zero. The Eagles also outshot Howard 30 to five, with 11 of the shots being on goal.
AU travels to Virginia Commonwealth University for their next game on Sunday, Sept. 14. This is their last game before Patriot League conference play opens at Lehigh on Sept. 20.

The media’s influence on the public view has always been evident. We turn to the media to expand our own limited scope, to see the world through a larger lens. We look to their reports and coverage not only to learn about situations around the world but also the reactions from others. 
The media wields great influence on society’s opinions and has the power to start a movement through its ability to spread a message in an instant—the predicament however, lies in what that message is.
In recent years, our nation has been plagued with seemingly endless attacks on innocent citizens, many who were in places considered safe, such as schools and movie theaters. The attacks in Aurora and Sandy Hook are only the tip of the iceberg on the recent killings that have plagued our nation.
While we deal with the horrors of this reality, we look for an explanation on why someone would feel motivated to go on such a horrific rampage. More often than not, the media claims that these shooters were mentally unstable, and that even though these attackers sought help in dealing with their challenges, it was to no avail. Though in some cases— such as the Santa Barbara shooting— these claims are true, often they have no factual basing. Without realizing it, our media is leading its audience to believe that most mentally ill people are a danger and pose a serious threat to society, where in reality this is not at all true. This problem must be realized and fixed before it leads to serious repercussions.
Dealing with a mental illness is a terrifying, ostracizing experience. The mentally challenged feel alone and scared, afraid to reach out for help and make their reality public.  Those who struggle with mental illnesses live in a situation a majority of us will never have to face, and can’t even imagine. They live with a constant fear of being rejected or hated for something that is out of their control. They are afraid of the possibility that they won’t be able to control themselves and may hurt an innocent person or a loved one in the process. 
However, almost all of them are not a danger to society. They want to live normal lives and are struggling to receive the aid they need and to combat their mental challenges in order to reach that goal. The media coverage reveals only a fraction of a larger community of people who are struggling with mental challenges; it is not representative of the majority. To battle this fear, to accept one’s situation, to make it known to others and to reach out for help takes an admirable amount of will and strength
But if society labels all mentally ill people as a threat and lashes out against them, these individuals will be less inclined to reach out for the aid they need. If everyone around them believes that they can’t be helped and will always pose a threat even if they are being treated, then soon they will believe this of themselves as well. If the general public is continually led to believe that mentally instability will cause attacks on the innocent, soon people will start lashing out against those who struggle with mental challenges. 
They are discriminated against, treated in a hostile manner and possibly attacked and made out to be lepers. Instead of promoting awareness and attempting to stop bad situations before they happen, current media coverage is sending us towards a downward spiral that will only make things worse.
Labeling aggressors as mentally challenged does not protect us as society; it weakens us.
To stereotype against all individuals who struggle with mental defects is not only inaccurate, it’s morally wrong. 
It contributes to a negative and hostile view built on assumptions and exaggerations rather than facts. Instead of creating a society where we look out for one another and aid those who need our help, we are building a culture that rejects and refuses those who are a helpless to their setbacks. We should aim to be a community that supports and nurtures each other, not a society that ostracizes and discriminates against those are who struggle with uncontrollable differences.
The media’s coverage of attacks and their reasoning that mental illnesses are to blame is misleading. Current coverage leads the audience to believe that mentally unstable people are a threat to society, regardless of whether or not they are receiving help to combat their challenges. 
This message is untrue, and can potentially lead society towards a future where mentally ill people feel unsafe revealing their problems, and where the general public will hostilely reject everyone who struggles with a mental defect. 
A balance must be struck between news coverage and reasonable explanation without gross exaggerations and stereotyping. The answer is not to label them as killers; it is to recognize the difference in the majority of people with mental illnesses compared to the minority of attackers and to act on that understanding by offering support and aid.

Activists demonstrate in Washington, DC, in support of Michael Brown and Ferguson on Sept. 6. 
Entrenched racism, the militarization of police forces and the mainstream media were just a few of the hot topic issues surrounding the death of Michael Brown that five AU professors and students discussed on Sept. 3.
Brown was a teenager from Ferguson, Missouri who was shot and killed by a police officer on Aug. 9. His death sparked widespread outrage and protests, as well as a national conversation about race in America. 
The event was held in Kay Spiritual Center and was a part of the Table Talk series, which holds lectures and forums about contemporary ethical issues, and was sponsored by the Office of Campus Life. 
Panelists Clarence Lusane of the School of International Service, Brian Forst of the School of Public Affairs, Washington College of Law professor Brenda V. Smith, professor John Watson of the School of Communication and Celine-Marie Pascale in the Department of Sociology spoke about the continuing racism and shared stories of former students who were in Ferguson.
Lusane, who has written extensively on issues concerning race and human rights, spoke about police oppression and called for increased political engagement.
“If ever there was a time to protest and speak out, it is now,” Lusane said. “If ever there was a time to challenge entrenched racism in police departments in far too many cities and towns, it is now. If ever there was a time for a new and radical reorganization of how policing is done in America, it is now.”
Forst added that police insensitivity and ethnic, racial, and class discrimination contribute community members distrusting law enforcement. 
The events in Ferguson should not come as a surprise due to the U.S. history of racism and segregation, Pascale said. The segregation continues in the society today, even though “we may not call it that,” according to Pascale. 
A former student of Watson’s witnessed this racism firsthand, he said. His former graduate student, journalist Alexia Fernandez Campbell of the National Journal, was in Ferguson covering demonstrations when police threatened to arrest her and a colleague. She frantically dialed Watson for help.
“Between huffing and puffing and blowing into her cellphone, she says, ‘I’m about to be arrested,’” Watson said at the forum.
Police were not allowing Campbell to reach a demonstration that was happening. 
“I reviewed the Communication Law class I taught to her, and I reminded her about the First Amendment,” Watson said, “and I reminded her the first ethical directive in journalism is to get the story. And I did not advise her, but I told her: get arrested.”
Campbell and her colleague were not arrested, but she was not able to cover the story because the demonstration was dispersed by the time the police let her free, according to a Journal report.
After the panel a dozen students gathered downstairs around coffee and cookies and shared their own views and experiences. Some students mentioned friends and family the same age as Brown. Some are even fearful for their own loved ones.
“I have a brother who is African American and he is big, just like how Mike Brown was,” School of Communication junior Justice Mirzakhani said. “And he was actually stopped by police because they thought he was someone doing something wrong, when really he wasn’t. This is something I hold near and dear to my heart because it’s so relatable.” 
For Ian Evans, a freshman in SPA, the forum gave him insights into the complex issues of race and economic status.
“I think conversations like this help us bridge cultural gaps,” he said. “I came from a community where we didn’t talk about race, and it’s my second week here and I’ve already had so much more stimulation [about racial issues] than I’ve ever had in my entire life.”
Students also expressed interest in continuing to discuss national racial issues on campus, with hopes that the University will help sustain the dialogue through similar forums and demonstrations. Many viewed the forum as a first step towards broader campus-wide engagement.
“Ferguson is a good launching point, but we need to address that this isn’t a one off incident,” said Samantha Storch, a senior in SOC. 
The Center for Diversity and Inclusion has a series of workshops planned around issues of race, privilege and other topics that students have said matter to them, according to Fanta Aw, Assistant Vice President of Campus Life.
“We’re going to be looking at all of the different ways in which we can carry this conversation forward,” Aw said. “We want to have a sustained and structured conversation over time and not just one conversation. So we have committed to doing more.”
