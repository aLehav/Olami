AU will have four new head coaches upon entering the 2013-2014 season, two of which have yet to be decided.
A head coach for the women’s basketball team will be announced next week, according to new Director of Athletics and Recreation Billy Walker. Former head coach Matt Corkery left the AU program in late July for a coaching position at Texas Tech University, The Eagle previously reported.
A strength and conditioning head coach has not yet been found since former coach Jake Patten left for James Madison University on July 8. However, the Athletics Department expects to announce their decision soon, Walker said.
Walker has already hired Mike Brenna to coach the men’s basketball team and promoted lacrosse interim head coach Emma Wallace to full-time head coach. 
Anabel Jimenez Hering was named women’s soccer coach in February prior to Walker’s arrival. 
Walker was named AU’s director of athletics and recreation in April after former director Keith Gill left for a similar position at the University of Richmond.
However, Walker has appointed two new head coaches in less than six months.
“It’s an opportunity to bring in fantastic new coaches,” he said. “I look at it as an opportunity to shape the future of not just our program but the future of all these great young men and women.”
Despite a busy offseason, Walker said he is excited to see AU’s athletics program resume.
“I’m really excited to get stuff started and start seeing some competition,” he said. “I feel like an athlete, I can’t wait to start to competing.”
