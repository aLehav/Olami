One adult male pedestrian was injured Wednesday night while walking across a crosswalk  between Wisconsin Avenue and Veazey Street in Tenleytown.
The man remains hospitalized, according to the Gwendolyn Crump, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department. 
Elizabeth Dorman, a worker at Cava Mezze Grille in Tenleytown, said she saw a car hit the pedestrian as he was crossing the street around 5 p.m.
“You could see the impact onto the windshield,” Dorman said. “The person was apparently knocked unconscious at the moment of impact and was taken away. The guy was taken away on a stretcher with a neck brace in the middle of the road.”
Police blocked off part of Wisconsin Avenue between Van Ness Street and Warren Street to take evidence following the incident. The police did not comment further at the time of the collision.
