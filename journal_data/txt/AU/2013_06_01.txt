The Berkshire apartments' convenience store closed June 1, sparking protest from some residents and AU students.
An online petition created on Change.org called on residents to protest the Berkshire management's decision to close what is affectionately known as "the Berks store" and currently has more than 450 signatures as of June 1.  
"The Berks store has been there for 27 years and its owners have created a lifestyle there," according to the Change.org petition created by AU graduate Laura Stephaich. "All the students at the Berkshire depend on the Berks store and even the community uses it frequently as there is a shortage of convenience stores around the area."
The petition calls on Berkshire apartment owners, real estate company Gables Residential, to halt renovations to the space now occupied by the Berks convenience store.
Gables Residential's corporate office and Stephaich did not return requests for comment. 
Gables Residential plans on replacing the convenience store with a delicatessen, a small convenience store and a recreational area, according to the petition.
Supporters of the petition will protest the issuance of construction and demolition permits and boycott the new store, according to a copy of the petition taped in the entrance to the Berks convenience store.
Karen Lake has been a resident of the Berkshire since 2007 and says the Berks convenience store influenced her decision to move into the apartments. 
"Most of the people that I have talked to, the older residents and the younger ones, have all said they are disappointed and will protest and have signed the petition and will boycott," Lake said.

Nearly a year after Armand's Chicago Pizzeria shut its doors at 4231 Wisconsin Ave., Nando's Peri-Peri restaurant has announced plans to take over the building. 
Scheduled to open this December, the African-Portuguese-style chain prides itself on its spicy "Peri-Peri" chicken.
Armand's, which had occupied the building for 37 years, closed in June due to rent problems. Rent increased from $260 per month to $12,000 over the span of Armand's 37-year run. 
The restaurant will seat 148 people with room for an additional 58 outside, according to a liquor license posted on the restaurant. 
The new Nando's will be just one of several additions to the company's growing roster of D.C. restaurants, with others currently planned for Navy Yard, Maryland and Virginia.
The restaurant chain has over 800 locations in more than 30 countries.
"Experience has also taught us that as long as we stick to our principles of serving amazing food in a totally unique environment with genuinely caring customer service, we can earn the trust and patronage of the local market and convert them to Peri-Peri fans," said Sepanta Bagherpour, director of marketing for Nando's Peri-Peri USA, in an email.
Even those who have dined at one of the over 800 Nando's restaurants will be in for a surprise at the new location. While each restaurant is decorated with an elegant charm and an eye-popping assortment of African paintings, the rest comes down to the individual location.
"We put a lot of effort in ensuring no two Nando's restaurants look the same," Bagherpour said in the email.
Nando's offers food once described by The Washington Post as "fast and sometimes fabulous." 
Bagherpour is confident that the restaurant will be able to do well at its new location due to its popularity at its Dupont location and around universities in the United Kingdom, Bagherpour said in the email.
"College life is not only about drinking,"  Bagherpour said in the email, "sometimes you have to eat, too."

During a rugby game April 20, Von Gerik Allena, a 2010 graduate of the School of International Service, saw the ball fall to the ground, giving him the opportunity to run it up the field. As he ran, a fan took a picture of him which soon became a viral meme.
When Allena, a member of the Washington Renegades, a men's Division III club rugby team, began to run toward the try zone, he heard everyone from the sideline yelling, "run, Von, you have to run."
"I saw the try zone, which is like the touchdown zone, and I thought, "Oh my God, I might actually get my first try today," Allena said. "Then I felt someone's arms wrap around my legs and I thought, there goes the dream, it's over."
Allena ran about 40 meters across the field before an opposing team member tackled him to the ground. During that time, however, Nick Van de Grift, who photographs all of the team's games, took a picture of Allena running with the ball.
The picture quickly went viral. On May 16, Allena posted on Facebook, "waking up and realizing my meme is on the

Galleries of memories propel "Signs of Life," a living diorama filled with characters caught in the middle of the Holocaust.
The Department of Performing Arts, in conjunction with Snap-Two Productions, Inc., LimanAde Productions and Issembert Productions, Inc., will stage the first academic dramatic reading of "Signs of Life" in the Katzen Studio Theatre June 1 and 2.
It's set in the Czechoslovakia's Terezin, a fortress retrofitted after the invasion of the Axis powers in World War II into a ghetto primarily meant for Jews. 
The production is based on the true events of Nazis' efforts to swindle the Red Cross into believing the ghettos were safe havens for Jews and sought to beautify the ghettos. 
Told in interceding vignettes, these stories include the dogged single-mindedness of a Nazi officer and his enduring belief in Hitler's empire; the budding young love between two people trapped in the ghetto; and Kurt, played by AU musical theatre graduate John Fritz, a man with an emotional conflict between helping Jews survive and preserving their art or saving himself by cooperating with the Nazis.
"Signs of Life" searches for those moments of levity against the grave possibility of death, along the way asking how one can move on from such moments.
Matt Rubbelke, a rising senior in the College of Arts and Science and the School of Communication, plays Simon, a romantic who falls for Leah (AU CAS and SOC alumna Lisa Michelle). He said his character brings comedic relief to the grim events in Terezin. 
"Simon is your typical, awkward Romeo who has no idea what he's doing, as far as wooing this girl," Rubbelke said.
Developing these ideas for the stage required research into the history of Terezin. During the show, historical footage of sketches by citizens of the ghetto appear on screens. 
James Randle, an AU alumnus and assistant director on "Signs Of Life," said his role was a unique experience.
"I'm assistant directing, narrating and designing the lights at the same time," Randle said. 
Randle had the script for four months before rehearsals began, giving him the opportunity to hone the ideas of the show with the director, DPA Associate Professor Gail Humphries Mardirosian, as well as the writers of the book and music, Peter Ullian and Joel Derfner. 
After an quick and intense week of rehearsals, the show was ready for the stage.
"The characters and the plot have undergone a lot of shifts as we go," Randle said. 
Ben Gibson, a graduate of CAS, plays Heidel, one of the prominent German officers in "Signs of Life." His belief in the Nazi empire is challenged by Commandant Rahm (played by School of International Service graduate Shannon McArdle), whose believes his job is simply bureaucratic trifle. 
"A lot of my choices are based off of trying to balance Rahm, the other officer, who is doing a job, but doesn't necessarily believe in it," Gibson said. 
Rubbelke managed to sum up the central idea of "Signs of Life."
"There are these people who, even amidst these horrific circumstances, somehow manage to have somewhat of, not a normal life, but a life." Rubbelke said.
When:  June 1st at 7 p.m. and June 2 at 1 p.m.
Where: Katzen Studio Theatre
Price: Free, but reservations are required. To reserve a seat email Laurie Levy Issembert at tllg22@gmail.com or call (202) 360-7578.
There will be talkbacks after both performances.
