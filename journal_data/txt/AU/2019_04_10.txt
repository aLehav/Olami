Maggie Rogers performs at the 9:30 Club on March 26. 
 
Maggie Rogers tells you exactly how she’s feeling, and she’ll make you dance while she does it. The 24-year-old Maryland native brought her debut album, “Heard it in a Past Life,” to the 9:30 Club on March 25-26. 
Rogers amassed a loyal audience after a video of Pharell reacting to Rogers’ song, “Alaska” during a New York University masterclass went viral in 2016. Rogers’ album is an attempt to reconcile who she is with the person the world wants her to become, as many of the lyrics deal with personal growth and change. Her music can be described as everything from folk to indie to R&B to pop.
Rogers makes music that fans can identify with, in part because of the authenticity and vulnerability of her lyrics. This is present in “Light On,” a song about self-doubt. While it seemed like everyone knew every lyric to every song, the audience participation for the verse, “you should be so happy now” was by far the loudest. 
Rogers’ opening act, guitarist Melanie Faye, opened the show with an instrumental cover of “Say My Name” by Destiny’s Child. After warming up the crowd with this hit, Faye played her own music, proving that her vocal abilities matched her skills on the guitar. 
Rogers’ started her own set with “Give a Little,” an upbeat track that she claims is a “reintroduction of herself.” The crowd was immediately responsive and everyone began to dance to the optimistic tune. Rogers seemed to feed off that energy during her performance of “Burning.” While she fluctuates easily between acoustic songs and energized dance tracks, these two are arguably the most clean-cut pop. 
The singer then took a moment to talk about returning to D.C., a place that she said felt like home. Rogers grew up in Easton, Maryland, and said she “grew up checking the listings for [the 9:30 Club] religiously.” Rogers had many friends and family members in attendance, including her dad, who she gave several shout-outs to throughout the night.
The show was packed with anecdotes and invitations to dance from Rogers. During “The Knife,” a song that evokes the emotional changes the young singer has faced, Rogers stopped to call-out the audience members on the balcony who she felt weren’t dancing enough. It was a playful yet effective way to encourage the few who weren’t dancing to let loose. 
Before “Light On,” Rogers explained the fear that she felt grappling with so much fame so fast. Finally, she dedicated “Dog Years” to her friends who have stuck with her through this new chapter of her life. 
Rogers ended the night with “Color Song” from her 2017 EP, “Now That the Light is Fading.” The song, which describes the colors of nature, was performed a capella to a silent crowd. Rogers even stopped using her microphone halfway through, making the finale even more intimate.  
“Thank you, I’ll see you soon,” Rogers said before exiting the stage, hinting at her upcoming performances in D.C. this fall. 
Maggie Rogers will return to D.C. at the Anthem on Oct. 7-8. Tickets can be purchased here. The album, “Heard it in a Past Life” can be streamed on Spotify and iTunes.

AU’s acceptance rate will be 35 percent for the 2019-2020 school year, a six percent increase from the previous year, the University’s admissions office told The Eagle. 
This is the first time that AU’s acceptance rate has increased in several years, rising back up to the same percentage as 2015. The increase is due to the University’s expansion of its Honors program as well as the Community-Based Research honors program, said Andrea Felder, AU’s assistant vice provost for undergraduate studies. 
“We increased the number of students who we admitted this year because we know that those students will have many options in terms of places where they’ve been admitted to,” Felder said. 
However, the class size is expected to remain the same, Felder said. The admissions office received 18,500 applications and admitted 6,515 students. 
Out of those accepted, approximately 40 percent of the admitted class lives in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Southern, Western and Northeastern parts of the country each account for around 14 percent of the admitted class. 
Additionally women continue to comprise the majority of accepted students, making up approximately 65 percent, of the admitted applicant pool. The demographic makeup of the accepted class of 2023 is 53.9 percent white, a drop from last year when 59 percent of accepted students identified as white. Black students made up 7.3 percent of the class, while Hispanic and Asian students made up 16.9 and 6.1 percent, respectively. 
Felder noted that the University saw an increased interest in the School of Public Affairs, which she said “could just be a nod to what’s going on politically.”
These numbers are preliminary and AU will not have a clear picture of the incoming freshman class until May 1 when they must submit their deposits. The University also accounts for a loss of students, known as “melt,” over the summer months.
