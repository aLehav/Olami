In the old Pokemon series, there was a move called Rage. The general objective of the move was to build up as much energy as possible before the enemy Pokemon could defeat you. It started off semi-powerful, grew to be extremely powerful and, if your Pokemon had not been defeated, would proceed to cause atom-splitting, team energizing, 3-1 lead momentum shifting damage. Your Pokemon would win the match.
Loren McKenzie is the volleyball equivalent of telling your Pokemon to use Rage. When McKenzie rises up on the attack or defense, she is not aiming to hit the ball. Instead, she absorbs the moment, then the ball, then the weight of the entire team and converts all of that potential into kinetic energy, ultimately coming to fruition on the one square foot of the court that the opposition can’t reach.
McKenzie finished the game with 12 kills and 8 blocks, but her statistics alone ignore the full story of the Eagles’ 3-1 victory over the Colgate Raiders last weekend.
It only looked as though the Eagles could be in trouble when they headed back to the bench following the first set. Having played their fourth game in seven days, it would be easy for the team to lose faith after a set-one loss.
With senior middle blocker Jeanne Westney and junior opposite Jasmine Ellison – key team members – out for the game, it would be easy to lose faith. It would be easy for the fatigue to reach them. But, on Saturday, McKenzie emerged as a two-way superstar, refusing to let the game slip away from the streaking Eagles.
At the start of the second set, when AU needed a spark, McKenzie delivered the first kill. When the Eagles surged out on a 7-3 run, McKenzie rose up for a block with senior outside hitter Helena Elbaek to force Colgate into a timeout, presumably to consider whether or not they wanted to just call the set then and there. McKenzie registered the final two kills and one block. As Colgate grew tired, the senior only grew more powerful.
Simply put, McKenzie provided when other could not, to the gratification of AU head coach Barry Goldberg.
“Her availability to hit balls as well as block does so much for everyone else on our team,” Goldberg said. “Sometimes, getting off the net and getting back up in transition can be difficult for the middle blockers, so when [McKenzie] does that, we’re in big business. If we can keep her in that kind of action, we’re going places.”
McKenzie came through when the Eagles needed it most. If the Eagles can continue to feed off her two-way ability, there’s no telling how far the team can go.

Trillectro returns to D.C. Saturday with headliners SZA and RL Grime
As I stepped into the 2018 Trillectro Festival at Merriweather Post Pavilion, my spirits were lifted by young people running around in brightly colored outfits, music blasting in the background and the building anticipation I felt to see so many amazing artists that were to take the stage in the following hours.  
The D.C. born festival skyrocketed in attendance as 2018 promised performances from SZA, 2 Chainz, RL Grime, Playboi Carti, Young Thug and The Internet. The venue was packed on Sept. 22 with a high-spirited mix of hip-hop, electronic and R&B music fans. Creators Quinn Coleman, Marcel Marshall and Modi Oyewole have grown the festival since 2012. 
“Coachella inspired the creation of our festival in that we saw how music brought people together in a beautiful, unique way,” Oyewole said in an interview with The Eagle. “We put our own spin on it and developed a culture within our hometown.”
Trillectro is an independent music festival created by three DMV locals. The event focuses on bringing in exciting names from the world of hip-hop and electronic music and also incorporates showcasing local, up-and-coming talent. The name, Trillectro, is a portmanteau of “trill,” a word that informally symbolizes the authenticity of hip-hop music, and “electro,” which represents the electronic genre of music. The 2018 lineup featured up-and-coming women like Rico Nasty and Snoh Aalegra. The festival is a single day event and is a guaranteed day well spent.  
When asked about possibly expanding to a multiple day festival, the creators admitted that they thought about expanding, but expressed their worry in the fact that multiple day festivals in the past had not done well in D.C., and believe that the single day festival fits their audience best at this moment. 
Oyewole said when the team begins to curate the lineup, it is important to book the artists early. He told The Eagle that it isn’t so much the competition that is difficult, but more the conflicting schedules that so many artists have.  
When the festival first started, some of Oyewole’s dream lineups/artist performances were N*E*R*D and Kid Cudi. According to Oyewole, in 2016, Cudi headlined their bill and debuted his lead single from his latest album, which was produced by Pharrell.  
“Experiencing that felt even better than having that dream lineup, because if you had told us years ago when I stumbled upon Kid Cudi’s ‘Day N Nite’ on MySpace that he’d be headlining a 10K person festival that me and my friends created, I would have laughed in your face,” Oyewole said. 
The crowds started to form around 4 p.m. for Young Thug, and the pavilion seats began to fill up as 2 Chainz and The Internet performed. 2 Chainz hyped up the audience, urging people to sing and dance in their seats. The Internet was the calm before the storm as they graced the audience with soft guitars and drums, as well as the lead singer, Syd Tha Kyd’s mellow voice. 
I felt light-hearted and happy after The Internet’s set, and walked around the festival grounds seeing friends laying on the grass above the pavilion, or people taking pictures in front of the smaller, more personal Hill Stage, located up the hill from the mainstage.  
The pavilion seating was completely filled during Playboi Carti’s concert, where the crowd singing the lyrics in unison were heard all the way at the entrance. After Playboi Carti finished, the second syllable of Trill-ectro was introduced as Carnage and RL Grime played their sets next. Both were DJ sets that made the crowd standing in the Lawn section go crazy. The group of festival-goers in the Lawn were pressed up against the gate facing the stage, eager to jump up and down to the beats the DJs produced. 
SZA and her three-piece band closed the show with the most entertaining hour of performances that I have seen in a while. Her following has grown in the past year, and the screams of adoration pouring from the fans were heard loud and clear. SZA spoke to the crowd as if they were close friends. 
She even came with a few guest appearances up her sleeve, which is rare for festival performances. Throughout the show, the 27-year-old brought out rappers, fittingly two D.C. natives, Goldlink and Wale. The singer later featured Jay Rock to perform his hit “King’s Dead,” sending the crowd ablaze. After singing her popular hit, “The Weekend,” SZA closed with “20 Something,” a slower song which fit the crowd’s mood as the amazing day came to an end. 
Trillectro was a huge success. It is safe to say they accomplished the goal of returning bigger and better than ever. The creators of Trillectro described their goals for this year’s event in the interview.
“Our plan this year was to return with a bigger and better lineup that still infused the right emerging talent, a hallmark of past Trillectro lineups,” Marshall said. “Merriweather Post Pavilion has undergone some major renovations since we were last there, so we knew we could step everything up a notch and provide festival goers with top notch amenities and bigger sponsor activations, as long as we delivered a solid lineup.”

Krish Mohan discusses political and social issues within the framework of stand-up comedy to let down the audience's defenses and start conversations on controversial topics.
Krish Mohan is a self-described social vigilante.
“To me, any activist is a social vigilante,” Mohan said. “Any protester is a social vigilante.”
Mohan’s method of social vigilantism? Stand-up comedy.
“I’m breaking these very traditional social protocols because comedy is only supposed to be about the superficial stuff, the very Jerry Seinfeld-type things,” Mohan said.
In his upcoming show “Empathy on Sale,” Mohan uses comedy to tackle traditionally divisive topics such as identity politics, mental illness and the misunderstanding of progressivism. Mohan said that his goal isn’t to sermonize. Instead, he strives to kickstart a conversation among the audience.
“When you get somebody to laugh at something, you’re easing their mind,” Mohan said. “You’re adding some levity to something that’s very difficult for them to address and now you have this open forum to talk about it.”
In some cities, Mohan has found that his audience is uncomfortable with his style of comedy.
“I might be one of the very few people that broached this subject in some sort of public platform, so they get uncomfortable because it’s not something that they normally talk about,” Mohan said.
He’s faced plenty of unreceptive audiences on his journey to becoming a nationally touring comedian. When he first incorporated politics into his bits, he found himself booking fewer and fewer gigs at comedy clubs and private events.
But “controversial” comedy was always the sort of comedy Mohan wanted to perform. He found himself performing at Fringe Festivals, talent showcases that give artists free reign to create a performance that suits their vision.  
His newest show is centered around empathy and cultural bubbles. Politics are divisive, Mohan said, but they don't have to be. Comedy can release the tension between progressivism and conservatism, he said, and Mohan tries to point out hypocrisies on both sides of the political aisle.
“If both sides can kind of laugh at the hypocrisies of the group,” Mohan said. “Then you can see the other side and say, ‘oh I get where these guys are coming from too.’”
Comedy and empathy will rarely convince someone to immediately change their mind, but, as Mohan described it, it’s the “first step.”
“As Bill Hicks would say ‘you’ve planted a seed,’” Mohan said. “If you want people to think differently, to think more progressively, or just about each other… then you should be investing in each other. You should be investing in people and not constantly be at each other’s throats.”
Krish Mohan will be performing at the Reliable Tavern in Park View (the closest Metro stop is Georgia Avenue-Petworth Station) on Oct. 12 at 7 p.m. Tickets are available online for $5 and $10 at the door.

YouTuber MadFit shows off a quick ab workout
Working out in college is hard. You have classes to attend, exams to study for and essays to write, and many students have jobs or internships. It’s hard to make a schedule that allows one to have time for schoolwork, a social life, and a workout routine. I know I have struggled with these issues. 
However, working out does not have to be a big time commitment. During my time at AU, I have learned some tricks for how to fit a workout into a busy schedule. Instead of going to the gym, here are some ideas to start working out from the comfort and convenience of your own dorm room.
Yoga mats are versatile and don’t only need to be used for practicing yoga. These mats are great tools that can help you comfortably work out in your room because they give you a place to lie down so you’re not directly on the floor. You can use these mats for yoga, sit ups and jumping jacks. Basically, these are useful for any type of workout you would do directly on the floor in your room.
Also, weights and dumbbells are great tools for enhancing workouts. Lifting weights, even if they’re just two or five pounds, can help build upper body and core strength. Weights come in different forms, too. You can get ankle weights or wrist weights that you strap around each extremity. These can enhance a yoga or zumba workout by adding some extra intensity. These weight and yoga mat items can be found at Marshalls, Target, Amazon and sporting goods stores. 
YouTube is a great free resource for anyone looking for a workout. Fitness gurus create tutorials for all kinds of workouts from flexibility to Zumba. These videos also vary in intensity so you are sure to find the workout video that suits you. Some good channels include Yoga with Adriene, Blogilates and MadFit. 
YouTube is also a great option when looking for group workouts. One way to take advantage of YouTube is to set the video up on your TV or laptop in a way that everyone in your room can see it. Then, you can all have a group workout. That way you can help one another push through hard workouts. If you prefer to work out alone, then watching YouTube on your phone is an excellent option, too. 
Another free workout option that is a viable option for your indoor workout routine is to download a free workout app. Workout apps allow you to personalize your workout by intensity and muscle group. Many apps enable you to choose the length of your workout, too. That way your workout is totally customizable. Some great apps include SworkIt, Jillian Michaels and Seven Minute Workout. 
Workout apps are great for people who want to exercise independently. All you have to do is set up your yoga mat and follow the directions the app gives you. When you finish your workout, many of the apps often tell you how many calories you burned. This can be a helpful advantage if you want to keep track of that information. Additionally, some apps can include meal suggestions if you want help thinking of healthy food options. I personally love using apps because of the personalization features they possess. 
If you’re OK with spending some money, a workout DVD is a great investment! Workout DVDs can come with a variety of exercises like zumba, yoga or cardio. Some DVDs are organized by muscle groups such as upper body, lower body or core. Do some research on workout styles and routines to better know what DVD style is right for you. You can typically find workout DVDs in the movie section of department stores, on Amazon and in sporting goods stores. 
Workout DVDs are good if you want to start a program. Many of them are programs that promise results within a certain amount of time. For example, some offer results in as little as 30 days, while some can be as long as six weeks. Knowing what you want to gain from a workout routine can help when choosing the right DVD for you.
