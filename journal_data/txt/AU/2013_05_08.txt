•I love how my u suck editor made it into the rants two times because the editor failed to post. U SUCK EDITOR! [Editor's Note: I blame finals.]
•@"AGREED. I'm a girl who also regularly masturbates, and whereas I'm very open and accepting when talking about sex, I'd never tell anyone I do it. There's just so much judgment" - As I guy, I'd feel awkward talking about it with fellow bros. Too awkward. Or if one of them asks something too personal about a chick I slept with. NOT COOL either. Even some guys have their limits. 
•@porn industry destroys & @sexual repression is damaging
You are actually both right. While porn in and of itself does not have to be a bad thing if the companies and/or individuals that produce it do so ethically with regards to the consent of all parties, it is an unfortunate fact that stars in the porn industry (especially women) are sometimes mistreated or even raped during production. At the same time, there is feminist positive porn out there that is produced ethically. If people, including women, find their passion in pornography, so be it.
•@"Having per-maritial sex makes you a slut in my book"
Not being able to spell pre-marital makes you a moron in my book.
•@weekly grocery bill - i say spend $60-$80 on good, whole food that you buy locally (either at the AU farmers' market or at bigger DC ones like the one in dupont). INTERNALIZE THE TRUE COST OF HIGHLY PROCESSED FOODS! what you eat becomes a part of you - that's worth something, isn't it? spend more on good food, choose to spend less on things like an extra drink at the bar (where most of my 'fun money' goes). 
•Don't think I've forgotten you and your little Charlie neighbor either sweetheart. You have the loudest, most annoying voice I have ever heard and I want to grab you and shake you until it turns into something normal. You need to straighten your act up and learn to be a decent neighbor. Because if I were your landlord, your ass would be warming the pavement. Oh, and by the way, the kind of far-left nonsense you espouse died in 1991. The revolution is not going to happen, you are not a washed-up 1970's stereotype. Wake up and smell the gulags honey, because the sort of stuff you support was part-and-parcel of it.
•It's summer. Give the rants editor a break. These things will probably go back to weekly for the next few months anyway.
•FYI, fourteen people died in that fertilizer factory explosion.  Most of them were police and firefighters, all of them had families.  So maybe wait a few more weeks before you start joking about it.
•@To the person who tried to argue that hazing is between consenting adults...
Yes, I get that.  Again, you're evading the larger question.  Suppose these were 21 year olds.  It still would be hazing and it still would be banned.  Or let's focus on the mayo, the milk, etc. (none of which are illegal to consume).  Setting aside AU's right to ban whatever it wants, I still haven't heard a valid moral argument against hazing.  And BTW, I'm not a frat boy, you could never mistake me for one... I'm just interested in the larger moral question.
•The overlooked story in this whole TKE fiasco is that the university seems to have been negligent in taking action against them. Why have there been no sanctions or personnel changes in student activities?
•@ "Doesn't matter if you're a guy or a girl. Having per-maritial sex makes you a slut in my book" - Doesn't matter what you think about this, because, judging solely on your spelling, you are obviously ignorant. How did you get into college? 
•"It sounds like my dad when he was trying to tell me about virgins and bastards.  Stupid... and... what the heck are you talking about?" - My ten year old cousin, describing what he knows about sex.  And by the way, the "it" he's referring to is a Discovery Channel show about guys who get their junk bitten off by aggressive fish.  Just made me laugh.
•I'm done with classes. What now?
•no rants no pants.
•@Because we have a sense of humanity... It's funny though because everyone else finds this more messed up than the pledges I've talked to do. I heard that they wanted to burn it because they believe it to be libel. I wouldn't have done the same, but I can at least see where they are coming from. Y'all should come down some.
