Newsweek recently named American University the sixth most diverse college in the nation. Although we are proud to be recognized for the diversity that we do have, we, along with other AU students, were shocked by this ranking. 
According to Newsweek, the racial profile of AU consists of 5 percent Asian, 4 percent African-American and 4 percent Latino students. In Newsweek’s study, diversity is measured in terms of ethnicity, geographic origin, economic status, sexual orientation, and gender. We are all aware of the female gender majority here at AU and we are honored that many international students choose to study on our campus. Furthermore, AU has also gained a reputation as a “gay-friendly” university and earned praise from The Advocate for its positive atmosphere for queer students. 
Each of these aspects of diversity are highly valuable and not to be diminished. However, can AU truly be considered a diverse campus without racial diversity and integration? At AU, we pride ourselves on our open-minded and politically active campus, yet we are limiting our progress as an institution with a lack of racial diversity and integration. What narrow racial diversity that does exist at AU is tempered by a distinct separation of students on campus.
This is evident in the greek system, the student activist community and the broader social context of our campus as a whole. For example, it seems historically black sororities and fraternities have been less integrated into the dominant greek community. 
We’ve noticed this type of separation within our own close friends and broader social circles. In these aspects, areas of student life at AU lack racial diversity, making it clear that we as students face issues of segregation within our very own institution.	
This is an important issue for AU to focus on in upcoming years. We should take advantage of the existing, although limited, racial diversity that AU offers and work to increase it in order to undermine racism as a system of oppression. This will enrich our experiences here as AU students and will better prepare us for our post-college lives. 
In approaching the issue, we want to emphasize crossing racial lines and opening discussion among all students. Race is important in the world outside of AU, and our generation is tasked with confronting the ingrained white privilege that exists in our country. We must form relationships and have personal experiences with others in order to improve the current racial inequalities of our country. White people should be aware of privileges and recognize their responsibility in helping to combat racism. To be silent about racial issues makes us complicit. We pride ourselves at AU in our passion for social injustice, so please speak out now. To proceed, we encourage you all to leave comments or write to us about your perspective on racial issues at AU. We have spent this semester noticing, questioning, and analyzing racial issues in our White Privilege & Social Justice class. We want to continue talking about racial segregation on our campus and find some answers by hearing from our fellow students, professors, and faculty. Do you see this issue in your own circle of friends and in your social life? What about in classes and in your involvement with campus activities? How can we make changes as individuals and as a collective student body to help our campus integrate?

Dear readers of the Editorial Page,
I’ve read your comments. And your letters. And emails. (There’s a lot more of the first kind — you do realize the best way to reach me is at edpage@theeagleonline.com, right?) I’ve read them all, and I have something to say to you all: You want “better” columnists? Fine.
Do it yourself.
How, you may ask? Starting in January, we here at The Eagle are launching our version of the Washington Post’s “America’s Next Great Pundit” contest. I encourage those of you have enough time to comment, critique, or just plain criticize our content now to try your hand column writing yourselves. It’s not the easiest task, but for those of you that are super opinionated out there (and I know for a fact that there’s a good amount of you), it’s a great outlet for all your frustrations with the world. (Or just another place to say your piece without having your friends remind you that it’s the fifth time you’ve ranted on that particular subject.)
We’ll kick off the contest in our first issue next semester — by that point, we’ll have great topics and great judges at the ready to help us find the next great AU pundit. There will also be a code of conduct, just to ensure fair play, no plagiarism, no personal attacks, no yapping your head off without any facts to back up your arguments.
You want more content? You want better columnists? Well now I’m putting the ball back in your court. Have a fantastic winter break, come back here in January, and then let the games begin.
Sincerely,
Your beleaguered editorial page editor, Linda Barnhart

AU will unveil the newest version of its portal Dec. 7 in a soft launch. 
Students can opt to use the new portal, called myAU, or continue to use the old portal, my.american.edu, until about February.
MyAU is the next generation portal, according to Francesco de Leo, AU’s director of Web and emerging technology.
This soft launch should mean fewer problems for the actual launch, he said. 
The new portal should be more personalized, especially with the creation of “team sites” that were modeled after Google Docs, according to de Leo. 
AU is looking for student feedback during this trial period, which can be submitted via the new portal, according to Project Manager Sheri Zimmerman.
Some parts, including the grades section, of myAU will still use the my.american.edu format temporarily, until all the information is moved over.
de Leo said he is looking to integrate Facebook into myAU in the future, but does not have any plans yet.
