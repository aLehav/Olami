John Carroll Lynch sat nestled at the conference room below the Rosewood Hotel in Georgetown. He just flew in from Boston to promote his new film “Lucky ,” mere days after the passing of the film’s star and legendary actor, Harry Dean Stanton.

	While playing with his glasses on the wooden conference table, Lynch reflected on the first time he met Harry Dean Stanton.

	“It was at a bar, Dantanna’s, where he would go there at least every Thursday, smoke cigarettes and drink tequila outside,” Lynch said. “He was a very funny man, mischievous, he had an impish quality to his humor, he was always smiling.”

	John then let out a small laugh, fondly reminiscing about the encounters he had with Stanton, and continued by describing his“sense of quiet,” saying “he was a person who was very happy not talking, happy in silence.”

	The conversation then shifted to the journey of making “Lucky” with Stanton, sharing that he was always asking questions about the film, unsure of whether it would eventually happen. When I asked Lynch how Stanton felt about making a tribute film for him, Lynch shared how he didn’t think Stanton “thought of it that way, and I don’t think it was ever pitched that way.” He then continued by saying the film was inspired by how Stanton “thought about life and his style of acting,” further expressing how the “love-letter portion starts to be something you talk about much later, but it was from first to last, to focus on Harry Dean.”

	While collaborating with his writers, 
	Logan Sparks and Drago Sumonja, John Carroll Lynch discussed the film as more of a “party with Harry’s friends, getting together and making a movie as a sort of party experience.”

	Lynch very much enjoyed his first time directing, citing how challenging it was and the number of things he had to learn in the process. Being surrounded by many directors, John’s general understanding of directing is now more fleshed and detailed in his mind. He added that he would love to have more opportunities to direct so he could be express himself more. “With anything you learn, if I was to learn how to play the piano or the guitar, first you got to learn the chords and in this case, you know I didn’t come completely cold but I had never done it so it was a lot of new experiences.”

	Another part of what he loved about making the film was working with Harry Dean Stanton, the man who John saw on the silver screen since youth. Harry Dean Stanton, who starred in classics such as Alien, Paris, Texas, Cool Hand Luke, and many more, has been a luminary.

	“The first time I remember seeing him I remember being so affected by, even as a kid, ‘
	Cool Hand Luke,’ he sings ‘Such A Closer Walk With Thee,’ plays the guitar, and that voice is so beautiful, he has such a calm about him in the maelstrom of that movie, it’s used as a kind of spring in the middle of the movie in this very hot place,” Lynch said. “It had occurred to me just now, after he died actually, that in the movie “Sympathy For Delicious” I played a pastor, and I sang that song.”

	Lynch paused for a moment, affirming this song connection, then discussed the film that he calls one of his favorites: “
	The Straight Story.”

	“It’s an acting clinic, in five minutes he tells the whole story again, Richard Farnsworth has seen all those events happen to him and it’s only in the response that his brother has that culminates and flourishes into a flower of that emotional moment. Those two sitting on that porch together, brings me to tears every time I think about it,” Lynch remembered as his eyes begin to water.

	It was clear from the conversation that John Carroll Lynch had a formed a bond with Stanton. Lynch was not only an admirer but a friend to this legendary character actor, and his film “Lucky” very clearly showcases this love.

	As I witnessed what happened on campus last month, I had one overriding thought: we have seen this before.  We have seen torch-bearing, swastika-clad demonstrators in Charlottesville this past August.  We have seen ugly, crass racial slurs on AU’s campus earlier this year, and we have seen an unrelenting barrage of violent acts and words on the national stage over the last few years.  Rather than appreciating that the United States is special because of its diversity and freedom, the purveyors of hate speech and violence hope to divide our country further.  But we have seen this before, so, with the right approach, we can frustrate their aims.

	The menacing crowd of white supremacists and anti-semites marching with their torches in Charlottesville was particularly jarring for many people, as it combined elements of Nazism and lynch mobs.  Those of us who believe fervently that past is prologue, and that knowledge of history is essential to understanding our present, know that masquerading as perpetrators of the Holocaust or as henchmen of Klan violence should not be dismissed as mere swagger; words and images do matter.  The Nazi Holocaust, which resulted in the inconceivable murder of six million Jews – two out of every three European Jews – during World War II, owed much of its effectiveness to the fact that it began by separating and dehumanizing Jews and others deemed undesirable by the regime. The kind of imagery employed by the criminal who violated AU last week has some goals in common with the Nazis: to liken certain groups of people to animals, to promote a fictional glorious version of a corrupt system, and to encourage fear of the stranger in our midst.

	Already, before the latest incident, AU had taken the rare initiative to found an Anti-Racist Research and Policy Center, headed by Dr. Ibram X. Kendi.  On an evening that should only have been celebratory, with detailed plans announced for the new center, insidious posters were hung in strategic locations – including the offices of the Center for Israel Studies – valorizing the Confederacy while proudly evoking its support for slavery in the cotton industry. In his beautiful and wise remarks to the campus community after the vandalism was revealed, Dr. Kendi acknowledged the wider circle of hurt that such acts create, specifically recognizing Jewish students as being victims of the same kind of anti-semitic, white supremacist agenda as the African-American community on campus and elsewhere.  “I write to AU students,” he proclaimed, “especially students of color and Jewish students.”

	As scholars of the Jewish experience, my colleagues and I know too well the Jewish people’s long history of being targeted by the type of hate and base prejudice that was demonstrated at AU last week.  But we also know the Jews’ history of activism – of resisting those who attack people because of their race, religion, or background, and of fighting for the rights of those victims.  This includes, in particular, a history of empathy with the African-American community and activism even at the risk of some Jews’ lives – from the turn of the 20th century, through the Depression era, and famously in the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 60s.  Jews have learned, in every era, that it is not enough to condemn hate crimes with words – but that informed action is the key to change. In my Jewish history and literature courses, I seek to inform about a history that is often difficult but remains proud, and to show our students that it is not enough to know, but also to speak out, provide support for victims, and expose hypocrisy and prejudice.

	I was struck by the following lines in Dr. Kendi’s remarks: “Courage is not the absence of fear. It is the strength to do what is right in the face of it.”  The same closeness that makes relationships more intense on a college campus, but can spread fear and despair much more quickly than in a normal community, can also provide the key to our solution.  If the University continues to respond, as it has, with creativity and openness – to different ideas and different people – if its faculty and students join together to learn, applying lessons from the past to our complicated present, then we will be fulfilling our mission, and we will join those who meet fear with courage.

James Murphy’s LCD Soundsystem at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2016.
James Murphy’s LCD Soundsystem at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2016.
One of the most influential bands of the 2000s, LCD Soundsystem, is set to be the fifth band to headline DC’s newest concert venue, The Anthem.
Fresh off the heels of their comeback album, “American Dream,” the dance-rock pioneers are embarking upon a U.S. tour that will end with a residency in New York at the end of the year. LCD Soundsystem will be playing on Oct. 17 and Oct 18 before heading to Nashville.
While their latest album spends much of its time mulling the endings of things such as friendships and ideals, the band appears to be in the midst of a rebirth. After playing an epic, final show at Madison Square Garden and putting out a live album, the band called it quits in 2011.
Prior to the MSG show, LCD Soundsystem had put out three stellar albums that blended genres seamlessly, and with clear reverence to their predecessors.
The Brooklyn-based band, fronted by the captivating music icon James Murphy put out their first full album in 2005 to massive critical acclaim. Singles like “Losing My Edge,” and the punchy, danceable “Daft Punk is Playing in My House,” brought a self-deprecating sense of humor and unique voice that  felt lacking in the mainstream.
The band’s second album, “Sound of Silver,” and third, “This is Happening,” contained songs, and sounds, that would help define modern city life in the 2000s. Themes of age, change and love were approached by Murphy in ways that could make you laugh, and cry, at the same time.
Although the band’s return was met with some initial skepticism, fans came around after the release of “American Dream.” While the album may be a slow burner, it still is as inventive and clever as almost anything the group has done before.
LCD Soundsystem will be playing on Oct. 17 and 18 at The Anthem. Limited tickets are available here. Doors at 6:30 p.m.
