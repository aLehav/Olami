Closing out Welcome Week 2016, Pop musician Charli XCX will play at the Student Union Board’s first concert of the academic year on Aug. 27 at Bender Arena.
The Cambridge born English singer is most well known for her track “Boom Clap,” which dominated pop charts back in 2014, following the release of her critically praised album “SUCKER.” Her voice also climbed to the top of the pop world when featured on Iggy Azalea’s smash hit “Fancy,” singing lyrics “I’m so Fancy, you already know.” 
Just last February, she released her EP “Vrooom Vrooom.” She also recently made news with the release of the music video she directed for rising pop star RAYE.
Opening for Charli will be Rock Electro group and D.C. locals Color Palette. The hometown band will be touring off their first and latest album “Vaporwave,” which was released this year. Their recent track “Bullets” was named one of USA Today’s song of the week. 
Doors will open Saturday at 8 p.m. and the performance will begin at 9 p.m. The concert will only be open to the AU public, and an AU ID will be required upon entry into the show. All bags will be subject to search and may not exceed 12" x 6" x 12."
