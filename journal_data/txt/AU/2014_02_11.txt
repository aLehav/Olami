“Orange is the New Black” actress and activist Laverne Cox reflected on her life as a transgender woman of color on Feb. 11.
“One is not born a woman, but becomes one,” Cox said at the start of her speech, citing Simone De Beauvoir. 
Women’s Initiative sponsored the event and presented Cox as their Women’s History Month Speaker. 
By the time the doors to Ward 1 opened at 7 p.m., the line to hear Laverne Cox speak had wrapped three times around the basement and was already out the door. 
Cox began by describing what she referred to as “a state of emergency for trans people.” She shared terrifying statistics regarding the exponentially high homicide, unemployment and violence rates for trans people, particularly trans people of color.
Much to Cox’s delight, the audience soon developed a system of snaps for times where they appreciated or agreed with one of her sentiments. 
After giving an overview of the subject, she spoke of her own story of growing up in Mobile, Ala. 
“Everyone was telling me I was a boy,” she said, “but I knew I was a girl.” 
She faced harassment from classmates and teachers, and was not accepted by her mother, a devout member of the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church. 
After a suicide attempt in the sixth grade, Cox poured herself into achievement, citing Alice Miller’s “The Drama of the Gifted Child,” in which a child repressing trauma feels they must overcompensate in other areas of their life. 
This need for achievement allowed her to transfer into the Alabama School of Fine Arts, where she noticed more than ever the implications of the intersections of race, gender, sexuality and class. 
After graduating from ASFA, Cox attended Indiana University, but transferred to Marymount College in New York after two years. She said that most of her education came from outside of Marymount and in the New York City club scene, where gender expression was celebrated instead of shamed. She met other trans women who caused her to question her misconceptions and eventually inspired her to begin her own transition. 
Six years after she began her transitioning process, Cox was still being “spooked” (spotted as trans) on the street. She recalled experiencing countless instances of street harassment and one assault.
“Calling a transgender woman a man is an act of violence,” she said, also emphasizing the importance of pronouns. 
In regards to the recent controversy regarding Janet Mock’s appearance on Piers Morgan, Cox said “Piers Morgan had difficulty hearing outside of his own narrative in order to hear Janet’s,” then, with a smirk, “Wow, that was diplomatic.”
During the following Q&A session, Cox accepted an honorary bid to Gamma Rho Lambda, a multicultural, LGBTQ-inclusive sorority on campus. 
By interjecting humor and honesty in a serious discussion about the intersections of misogyny, transphobia and race, Cox delivered a message of positivity and love. Students who originally came to see Sophia from “Orange is the New Black” left with a desire to overcome the patriarchy and resist oppression. 
And for that, we give her snaps.

I have a few issues with feminist rhetoric. 
Many of the feminist postulates we hear every day are based on social constructivism, which asserts that gender roles and everything we associate the terms “male” and “female” with are not natural, but instead developed by society. This theory, however, does not show the complete picture of what really led to the gender roles in our society today. 
An article published in The Guardian says many of our preconceived notions about gender differences are not complete gibberish. Men’s brains are better suited for “perception and coordinated actions” while women’s brains are better for “social skills and memory.” Men specialized in hunting because they are more inclined to take risks, possess more upper body muscles and are better at coordination and spatial skills. 
On the other hand, women typically picked fruit and raised children because they were better at memorizing, multi-tasking, color differentiation and socializing. Over time these practices became traditions and slowly evolved into entrenched social norms that we have today. These social norms have changed in recent decades, and will continue to change in the future. 
Many claim that masculinity, a social construct, oppresses women and thus should be altered or abridged. This notion will undoubtedly face animosity from men because it basically tells men that the very qualities that define them are problems. This sort of social engineering deprives men of their masculine identity and threatens society as a whole. 
Radical feminism is one of the main reasons many Americans eye the word “feminism” in a derogatory way. Others suggest a 21st century gender role can allow social harmony between genders without labeling masculinity as being purely violent, aggressive and impulse-driven.
There is nothing wrong with pushing for gender awareness or challenging accepted social norms. However, some feminists have largely failed to promote the cause of feminism in a cooperative, comprehensive fashion by creating a new trend of intolerance of gender differences and freedom of expression. 
In order to achieve their full potential, feminists should embrace women and men alike in a respectful and open dialogue without blaming everything on men. This approach would address gender issues without driving an edge between men and women.

Correction appended
The Peace Corps named AU the third largest volunteer-producing, middle-sized university in the country Feb. 11. AU lost its No. 2 slot to the University of Virginia by a single student. 
AU has fluctuated between second and third place since 2009 with the exception of 2011, when it was in fourth place.
AU currently has 43 alumni serving in the Peace Corps across 27 countries, including Senegal, Benin, Ethiopia and Peru. Among AU graduates, 940 have served in the Peace Corps since its inception in 1961, according to the Peace Corps. 
Western Washington University sent the most alumni to the Peace Corps with 65 volunteers currently abroad.
George Washington University sits one place below AU with 41 current volunteers, followed by Cornell University and the University of Vermont with 29 volunteers each. 
President John F. Kennedy founded the Peace Corps in 1961 shortly after his inauguration “to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs with skilled manpower.”

Correction: A former headline stated “AU drops to No. 3 in Peace Corps alumni,” which is incorrect. The headline has been corrected to reflect the study only includes alumni currently enrolled in the Peace Corps.
