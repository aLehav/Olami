	They say distance makes the heart grow fonder, but it sure can bring loneliness, too. Being miles away from your significant other can be a challenge, but if you know how to go about it the right way, it can be worth it, experts say.

	Barry McCarthy, a professor who teaches human sexual behavior and psychology of well-being, knows that long distance relationships have high risk of failure, and said finding ways to deal with conflict is crucial.

	“One of the things that is important with couples who are trying to handle a long distance relationship is that they have a clear agreement about what the parameters are,” McCarthy said. “Like anything else in psychology, motivation and context is everything.”

	To succeed, the agreement between couples should be clear and realistic.

	McCarthy said a good agreement between a couple addresses why they’re together, what they value about being together and what the guidelines are. Although the agreement should be specific, it is important that it leaves room for error.

	“You’re never going to get perfect behavior or a perfect agreement,” McCarthy said. “[If you do], you’re going to wind up getting hurt or betrayed and it’ll destabilize you and the other person.”

	It’s important for couples to communicate with one another while being specific and understanding of their partner’s wants and needs. McCarthy said the biggest thing to end a long distance relationship would be for someone to feel a sense of betrayal, whether it be emotional, financial or sexual.

	Infidelity hurts relationships, although that’s usually when the couple hasn’t agreed to it, said Kaitlyn Goldsmith, a University of New Brunswick doctoral student studying clinical psychology.

	“There’s a lot of couples that do have more of an open relationship arrangement, and that can work for some people,” Goldsmith said.

	Those who worry about their partners cheating on them because they’re far apart can rest easy, according to Goldsmith’s research.

	“In one of my studies, we actually found that the rate of infidelities don’t differ between long distance and non-long distance couples,” she said. “There’s pretty similar rates.”

	When analyzing the behavioral differences between young adult relationships that are closer together and further apart, Goldsmith said she found keeping in contact to be extremely important both romantically and sexually.

	“Things like texting, messaging, Facetime, Skype, any kind of social media channel are particularly important for maintaining the romance piece of it,” Goldsmith said.

	Goldsmith said this includes keeping the sexual connection alive via technology as well, with sexting and other creative ways of keeping in touch with your partner.

	Not everything has to be behind a screen, though. Making time to visit one another is also crucial in order to fulfill that need of being together.

	“Being able to have sex more frequently when you actually do see each other is important for maintaining that sexual connection,” Goldsmith said.

	Serina Williams, sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, has been dating her girlfriend for more than a year, with most of the relationship long distance. The couple has managed to keep their relationship alive while living across the country over 2,000 miles away. Williams attributes much of their success to planning and communication.

	“Always plan ahead,” Williams said. “The key things in any relationship [are] communication and understanding. Everything is a bit harder, but with the right person it’s all worth it.”

The AU women’s volleyball team secured a dominant 25-19, 25-14, 25-17 victory over non-conference opponent George Washington Wednesday night in Bender Arena to end their four-game homestand. The Eagles never trailed in any set and controlled the tempo of play throughout to claim their sixth consecutive victory after losing to Navy Sept. 26.
The Eagles (14-7, 5-1 PL) used a balanced offensive approach to keep the Colonials’ defense off-guard and finished the match with a hitting percentage above 0.300 for the sixth consecutive game. Junior outside hitter Aleksandra Kazala and sophomore outside hitter Shannon Webb led the balanced approach with 12 kills each. Kazala, who recorded her 1,000th career kill over the weekend against Lafayette, was honored before the game to commemorate the career milestone. 
Sophomore outside hitter Helena Elbaek, the team’s second-leading attacker, did not play against GW, giving senior Hoakalei Dawson an increased role in the rotation. Dawson finished the game with seven kills, eight digs and two service aces. 
“Helena was rested today, so she’ll be ready to come back on the weekend hopefully. Hoakalei played a good match and Shannon did as well,” head coach Barry Goldberg said. “It was a good job overall from everybody but certainly Shannon and Hoakalei as two of our hitters did really well.”
Goldberg said the greater balance in the Eagles’ offensive approach allows for more dynamism and efficiency in their attack. 
“We’re mixing the ball around a little bit more and both of our setters are doing pretty well with it,” Goldberg said. “If they can mix it up and not give it all to Ola [Kazala] as they were doing halfway through the season we can get more opportunities and other players are coming through and hitting well. That’s really important for us.”
Junior middle blocker Cheyenne Orsi also added seven kills for AU. Junior setter Kennedy Etheridge recorded 26 assists and libero Kristan Largay tallied three service aces. Aaliya Davidson led the Colonials (6-15) with eight kills, but GW was limited by their unforced errors throughout the match. The Colonials made 14 attacking errors, 10 combined service and service return errors and three ball handling errors in the match. They hit 0.188 as a team. 
The Eagles play their next three matches away from Bender Arena in a pivotal stretch of the season, playing Bucknell on Friday, Colgate on Saturday and Loyola Maryland Oct. 17. 
“We are at Bucknell and Colgate this weekend to finish off the first round [of league play],” Goldberg said. “We’ll get to know everyone pretty well and then we’ve got to come back to be even better in the second round to see if we can make the playoff.”

“Fine messes”, “just wars”, “reliable rumors,” and American political “science.” I get a kick out of fun oxymorons. Okay, that last one isn’t so fun. It’s just painfully true. Let me explain.
Last week I stumbled upon a Ted Talk from a psychologist named Jonathan Haidt. Haidt is a New York native, a professor at NYU, and self-proclaimed liberal. He has a son and a wife, both of whom share his progressive world view. He is not a bipartisan man. Yet, in his talk, “The moral roots of liberals and conservatives,” Haidt says this: “...If we are going to understand the world, to seek a deeper understanding of the world, our lack of moral diversity is going to make it harder.” 
Haidt may be a Liberal, but he’s also a psychologist. He understands what it means to live in an echo chamber, and how dangerous it is to do so. Haidt’s point ends up being this: Liberals’ roles are to tear down faulty institutions and conservatives’ roles are to keep the ones that work. It’s an intricate balancing act -- Haidt even compares it to the yin and yang of Daoist mythology. 
American politics is in such a rut because too many liberals and conservatives hate each other’s guts. Now more than ever, our country is divided. Donald Trump’s election has resulted in not just a proposal for a border wall, but a real wall -- a partition between helpful conservative beliefs and helpful liberal beliefs. It’s so bad that in some parts of the country, “liberal” or “conservative” have become dirty words. They shouldn’t be. We need both. 
Just like Haidt, I’m firmly in the liberal camp. Both my parents are liberal, my father even radically so. But that doesn’t mean I should hate the other side. If the liberal’s role is to tear down the faulty institutions, then I should reserve my hate for the parts of “the other side” that need a wrecking ball and maybe even some dynamite for good measure. Apply the change not liberally (pun intended), but discriminately so.  
For example, the free market is an institution worth keeping.  Even Bernie Sanders, the patron saint of college socialists, would never propose something as radical as completely dismantling the free market. Despite its flaws, while plenty, there’s no denying the sheer efficiency of mostly unrestricted trade. The free market is the one of the most criticized aspects of America mainly because it is most successful. 
What are the institutions worth dismantling? In my opinion, there are many. The idea of traditional marriage is a good example. In 2015, the voice of the left, and even much of the right, agreed that to keep gay marriage illegal was to stay on the wrong side of history. So, it was changed. In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, the idea of gun control has once again sprung to the forefront of conversation. If it is popular enough, then it too shall change -- a triumph for liberalism. 
It may seem like there are exponentially more ideas worth changing than keeping. Indeed, it’s true. But this shouldn’t be misconstrued as a failure on conservatism’s part. Ideas become outdated or stop working. In the case of gay marriage, the idea was always wrong. Consequently, it’s easy to blame conservatism for everything wrong with America. After all, aren’t conservatives the ones supporting these archaic ideas? True, but they are not unique in doing so. Every established idea has had at some point popular support. Conservatives supported it, and liberals too.  
Yes, the ratio is skewed. And yes, the bad ideas often outnumber the good. But that’s not a terrible thing. That’s progress.

Who inspires you?
For me, the list includes my parents, my tenth grade high school English teacher, John Green and Nellie Bly. 
It now includes Malala Yousafzai. 
On Sept. 25, 2017, the University named Malala Wonk of the Year. To explain why this is so important, allow me to backtrack. Malala Yousafzai is an activist for girls education. In 2014, she was the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. The Four others have captured the Wonk of the Year award because they are smart, passionate and engaged in issues with the goal of creating change. 
Upon coming to this event, I knew who Malala was. I knew her background and what she stood for, but I did not openly consider her one of my inspirations. But, after seeing her and hearing her speak, it is hard for me not to consider her one of my inspirations. 
When President Burwell introduced Malala, she highlighted a trait that Malala possesses that is not often considered in the Wonk of Year decision process: grace. President Burwell could not have more perfectly described her.
From the moment Malala walked on stage, I sensed her aura immediately. She was unfazed by the crowd size and took in the audience's admiration with the humblest of smiles. After accepting her award, Malala did not use the podium, but rather she confidently strode from one side of the stage to the other. She appeared comfortable and natural, not showing a hint of intimidation. Despite being a celebrity, she humanized herself. She clearly has a message she wants to share, but she did not present herself as an icon that should be beloved by all. Rather, she was simply a girl who had something to say.
When she proclaimed phrases like “all girls can speak, all girls can be what they want,” and “young girls should believe in themselves,” they did not sound fabricated. they seemed to be words she actually believed. In addition to her genuine beliefs, she has a natural knack for humor. From referring to herself as the "shortest wonk ever" to insisting that her brothers are persistently annoying, she never acted smug.
Some people glide into the limelight and attach titles such as “activist” to themselves because they desire to be perceived as involved in the issues. Titles mean nothing if there are no actions to support them. Malala does not rely on titles. She relies on advocating for progress and she is only 20 years old. 
People should aspire to live like Malala. Do not focus how people will perceive you in response to your actions. Focus more on what your actions are and how they can be beneficial to the world around you. 
Present yourself gracefully. It’s fine to be proud of all you have accomplished, but remain humble. Others will be more amazed by your accomplishments if you are not bragging about all you have done. There is always more to do. 
Finally, if you do something of value and become a global inspiration, remember your roots. You’re still a human being. It’s important to step away from the podium sometimes and speak to your audience like they are normal people, not just your fans. 
Today’s world is messy. Pessimism can seep into our minds leaving us to wonder, “what actually can we do?” But Malala does not wonder, she does. The world is lucky to have people like her. And if that is not inspiring, I am not sure what is.
