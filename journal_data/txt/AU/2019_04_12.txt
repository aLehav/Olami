Note: The ranking system used here is based entirely off of the general vibe I get when walking into each building. It’s ghosts, there’s not really an exact science to it. 
Despite being the most cursed place on campus, Kogod is far from the most haunted. Sure, I’ve only been there once, but, in that five minute time span, literally everyone I encountered was in full business-formal attire even though it was eight p.m. on a Thursday. This is exactly why it’s the least haunted building; all the ghosts are too scared that some Chad will come up to them and start practicing his sales pitch. 
It’s next to Kogod, so the weird energy that emanates from it rubs off onto Kay. Also, based on the many shows I’ve watched and books I’ve read, ghosts tend to avoid places of worship. 
I’m only ever been in the gym part of Cassell, but it all seems too nice to be that deeply haunted. Also, people are almost always there, and ghosts tend to like hiding out in places that are a little more secluded. 
The only ghosts there are the ghosts of the law students who died trying to study law. 
SIS is way too modern to attract much ghost attention. No ghost would want to live there. There may be a few floating around the maze that is the third floor, but really, it’s not the best place to go if you’re looking for one, because everyone knows ghosts exclusively haunt old Victorian buildings while wearing period-appropriate attire. 
McKinley suffers from the same problem as SIS -- it’s too modern. It’s also sandwiched between a few deeply haunted buildings, so most of the ghosts choose to camp out somewhere nearby. That being said, some dead journalist-ghosts definitely hide out in those weird corner rooms, whispering into the ears of fearful students about how journalism is a dying industry. Ultimately, that’s more terrifying than an actual ghost. 
Sure, it’s brand new, but dorms are a great place for ghosts to mess with people because most students can either blame weird ghost activity on their lack of sleep, their mental burnout or their level of intoxication. 
TDR is inherently haunted; you can’t convince me otherwise. Imagine that place in the dark and tell me you don’t picture at least three ghosts floating around. You can’t. That being said, something about the aura of Freshii seems to keep too many ghosts away -- not to mention the food.
The Battelle atrium is a liminal space, especially at night. Ghosts enjoy liminal spaces because they kind of exist in one. Therefore, via the transitive property, ghosts enjoy the Battelle-Tompkins building. At least somebody does.
Hurst is at least 3,000 years old, so of course it’s haunted. Those wood walls and creaky stairs make the building a prime ghost hotspot.
It’s the science building. All science buildings are haunted by the ghosts of science experiments gone wrong. Also, it’s just a plain creepy building; the basement has no windows and all the walls look like they probably have lead paint on them. There’s a reason why AU had to hurry up and build that new Hall of Science, and ghosts were definitely a part of that reason. That’s all I’m saying. 
The aesthetic of a haunted library full of old books is too perfect. If there weren’t any ghosts in Bender Library, I’d honestly be a little angry about it. Everything about the environment screams “haunted.” It’s the perfect place for a ghost to knock some books off of a shelf or float aimlessly through the stacks to the lovely ambient sound of sobbing students. 
SPA is haunted by the ghost of Artemas Ward; he’s bitter that someone changed the building name to Kerwin. Can you really blame him? If AU honestly wants to avoid any issues with Mr. Ward’s ghost, they really should consider changing the name back. Former University President Kerwin is not quite a ghost yet, so it’s not like he can haunt it in revenge. It’s a win-win scenario. 
It’s a haunting place to be regardless of whether or not there are ghosts there. Let’s face it, we’re all deeply haunted by the thought of who we were freshmen year. You can give Anderson a makeover but you can’t do the same to our memories of us as freshmen. 
SIS students were moved to the new SIS building for a reason. AU didn’t want their favorite students getting possessed by any more ghosts in EQB. 
Watkins is absolutely terrifying. First of all, it’s secluded away from the rest of campus, perfect for ghosts to sequester themselves in. Second, the basement of Watkins truly looks like it should not exist. The stairs feel like they’re on the verge of falling apart every time I walk down them. For some reason, there’s only one of them so getting to the basement is incredibly inconvenient. I swear I see the ghost of an old Victorian lady every time I enter that bathroom. 
I’ve never seen someone enter or exit Asian Flavors. Ever. That place is so haunted people naturally avoid it. Our internal GPS devices deliberately steer us away. I don’t know what happened to make Asian Flavors such a haunted place, but it must have been something truly dark. 
Be honest with me. Did you know EQB had a third floor? Seriously, did you? I’m not talking about the second floor, which I guess could be considered a third floor of the building when you take into account the basement. No, I’m talking about an honest-to-goodness third floor. They have tables and lounge chairs and offices up there. I have been going here for two years and I only just now discovered this deeply haunted alternate dimension. I’m not saying someone has been murdered on this floor, but someone has definitely been murdered on this floor. There are no windows, the doors to enter it are surprisingly thick and heavy, and when I visited at 2 p.m. on a Tuesday, a time when students are usually out and about, the entire floor was devoid of life. But not paranormal activity. That place is haunted and I’m probably possessed by a demon now. I just feel bad for the professors whose offices were placed there. 
Megabytes never used to be haunted, but now the whole boarded-up health code violation aesthetic it has going makes it a prime spot for ghosts. They’re attracted to it like moths to a light. It’s uncanny.

Pop star Hayley Kiyoko will headline AMFest, an arts and music festival, at American University on Saturday, April 20, the AU Student Government Student Union Board announced Wednesday. 
Kiyoko, dubbed “Lesbian Jesus” by her fans, is a lesbian musician and a major advocate for the LGBTQ community. Her music often focuses on her emotional struggle with her identity, and highlights LGBTQ-related issues, including her music video “One Bad Night,” which raised awareness of violence against transgender women.  
She released her debut album “Expectations” in 2018 and now has over 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify. Some of her popular tracks include “Girls Like Girls,” “Curious” and “What I Need” featuring R&B artist Kehlani. 
Before rising to fame, Kiyoko was a member of the all-female pop group The Stunners, with "rhythmic pop” artist Tinashe, and was featured in the 2011 Disney Channel original movie “Lemonade Mouth.”
AMFest will take place on the quad from 2 to 11 p.m. and is co-hosted by the Kennedy Political Union, Women’s Initiative, the Alumni Association, AU Club Council and WVAU. Other members of the lineup include the Maryland-based artist Mannywellz, D.C. artist Babeo Baggins and many more musicians from the D.C.-area.
AMFest will also feature a “Women in Entertainment” panel with Girlaaa and peace and body roll duo BOOMscat at 3 p.m. in the Tavern. Students can also enjoy cotton candy, henna, a painting station and other activities.
AMFest will take place on the quad on Saturday, April 20 from 2-11 p.m. The event is free and open to the AU community and the public.

As the director of “The Descent” and “Dog Soldiers,” Neil Marshall is no stranger to tackling macabre and unearthly stories. While the “Hellboy” universe seemed like the perfect playground for him, the film is lifeless and falls flat despite the gratuitous amount of blood and gore and David Harbour’s solid performance as the titular character. 
The reboot introduces us to Nimue The Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich) who was trapped for centuries and exiled, only to rise again and build an army of monsters roaming the earth. She threatens to bring on the apocalypse to seek her revenge, and Hellboy (Harbour), and his team are tasked to put an end to it.
The film is certainly less atmospheric and more up front than Guillermo Del Toro’s 2004 version. There is neither a reverence to the mythology of the Hellboy character nor a convincing portrayal of the film's own pulpy sensibilities. There’s also a lack of patience and a feeling of tonal imbalance, with a repeated influx of jokes, blood and swearing. While that may appeal to some, it quickly feels forced, over-the-top and out of place.  It seemed like the filmmakers were more concerned with kickstarting a franchise and having it appeal to as many audiences as possible rather than serving the film’s characters.
Harbour successfully plays Hellboy as a rebellious, troubled individual trying to find his place in the world. He wrestles with himself about what it means to be a face of evil doing good. He, along with cast members Sasha Lane and Ian McShane, try their best in grounding the film, and it helps that the CGI creature designs are creepy and well-made. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch is interesting enough, blending metal rock with a modern composition. Some of the production design and technical make-up are impressive as well.
Marshall directs this film in a surprisingly hackneyed way, unlike his previous work in “The Descent” or the popular “Blackwater” episode in “Game of Thrones.” The film seemed more like a network television pilot than a full fledged film at times, and the scenes have no sense of pacing or comedic timing. Hellboy also suffers from obnoxious needle-drops and jarring editing, taking away from a lot of the action on screen. 
With Hellboy, there is potential to tackle unique and otherworldly stories involving the occult, while grounding it with strong, interesting characters. With two installments already made about the character, it is disappointing to see producers and filmmakers bet on painfully humdrum stakes of a villain threatening to end the entire world, and then accomplishing it with a lack of finesse akin to Suicide Squad and The Mummy. It’s even more confounding that the previous installments, helmed by an Academy Award-winning filmmaker, weren’t able to complete their trilogy.


“Hellboy” will be released nationwide Friday, April 12.
