•ZOMG TODAY IS GOING TO BE THE BESTEST DAY EVARRRRRRR



•White people have feelings too. I'm not racist at all, but when you say things like "I hate all white people, they are all racist", THAT MAKES YOU RACIST. So if you don't want to be discriminated agaisnt, don't discriminate. It's a two way street.
•I'm scared for my future, not because of the seemingly insurmountable amount of debt I'll be in, but the fact that I came here expecting to find the girl I'll be with for the rest of my life; now I have only a semester left, and its beginning to look like I'll never find her. Forever friendzoned.
•@globalscholarssuck, no but we know the difference between 'your' and 'you're' and appreciate the value of spellchecking. Maybe you need a few more years at college.
•All the people ranting that they hate AU and never want to come back, why are you here? Are you seriously paying 50K a year to hate your school? #Transfer
•Not sure what was worse; waiting on the long line for TDR stir-fry with the flu, or having to listen to you for the whole time go on about how you hate your parents and love to stare at yourself while you're filming a show.
•@”US News and World Reports includes sports and grad schools when calculating rankings.” Lol Jocks wish this were true. Actually US News Rankings are calculated by a combination of freshmen retention rate, faculty resources (number of professors, small class sizes, faculty tenure, etc), academic reputation (published articles, highly ranked departments, etc), student selectivity (average SAT/ACT scores and GPA of freshmen), university endowment, and percentage of alumni donating money to the school. Sports are not a factor. And they shouldn’t be because throwing a ball around is in no way enriching the mind or helping society.

•@other Russian/SIS/nat'l pol people: there are others like me? we're not a nearly nonexistent species? this is fantastic news. let's be friends :)
•@"Why on earth would they change how the Dean's List works?" If you have ever been to an AU graduation ceremony you will know why.  When 90% of students graduate cum laude it makes the school look like it is fraudulently giving every single student an A.
•I don't know what I am going to do without rants over winter break. I guess I am going to read the old rants from other schools. Does anyone know any other schools that have rants? Eagle Editor, do you? Do any ivy league schools have rants?
[Editor’s note: No idea. Maybe try FML or Post Secret?]
•Football has bee proven to cause brain injury. So proud AU doesn’t participate in this Neanderthal-ic activity.
•@smokers: I honestly couldn't care less whether you smoke on campus or not. it's your choice and all but it would be nice if the butts made it into the trash. The ward steps have a trash can yet they're covered in cigarette butts. Smoke all you want just don't litter please.

•I'm asexual.  Sometimes, I can be classified as aromantic; it's like all attraction is shut off in me for several months.  But it comes and goes--sometimes, I really do want a romantic relationship.  I'm too scared, though... wouldn't it be wrong for me to be in a relationship with someone only to randomly not want to be with them like that anymore, and then a few months later be interested again?  Help me Eagle Rants--you're my only hope (not really, but you get the gist).
•I'm not bisexual, but I'd like to try making out with a girl.

•I don't think you understand exactly how much I like you. When I see you, and we talk, I cannot help but smile and stare into your eyes. (YEAH THIS SOUNDS CORNY BUT THIS IS REAL.. really.. not joking..) I want to continue building our friendship into a possible something more like hookup; but the stupid MONTH long winter break is in the way. I hope you'll still have that fire of being my friend like you do now. I cannot wait until we study together. It will be the highlight of my week. Literally.
•Wait so I can't take a Gened P/F next semester?? :(
[Editor’s note: You can next semester in the spring but not after fall 2012.]

•I'm desperate for love. I don't mind admitting it, I just don't know who to admit it to....
I really need a hug. I want someone to hold me. I don't care about sex at all, I just need someone to love. It's never happened and I'm losing hope that it ever will. Can anybody find me somebody to love?

•Dear Best Friend Back Home,
I get it--you're happy with your new boyfriend.  That's great, I'm glad for you.  But now that we've had three 2-hour long Skype sessions with you (only you) talking nonstop about him (ONLY HIM), it's starting to get really old.  Would it kill you to talk about something else, anything else?  Or, here's an idea, ask me about my life?  I don't even want to talk to you anymore and it breaks my heart...
Love,
"Variety is the Spice of Life"
•Alright, look. Now, I know that rankings are based off of specific criteria and each school is good for it's own reasons... but to know that I could have gone to an in-state school, paid like 1/6 of tuition, still had direct access to D.C. via the metro, and gotten a similar education not to mention been at a more recognizable and higher ranked school (from which I've recently heard professors talked about in my classes and even had one as a guest speaker)... look, I love AU.. but I'm going into a lot of debt for this.
•@hopeful"convert"  Just make it known you're open to this. ;)
•Nothing about being single could make me happier than finding out your ex boyfriend is now a misogynist frat boy douchebag.
•@patiently waiting girl
i'm you're woman. although currently abroad, expect a conversion come this spring.
hope you can hold out.
-your latent lesbian lover
•Isn't it in the SG bylaws that the Senators and Execs can't accept gifts, etc.? Then why do THEY get VIP seats and they're picture with every elite that visits this school, while we all sit in the general audience? Transparency.
•The awkward moment when the guys in Z-Burger are so excited to see you and give you a discount for being a good customer. I don't eat there THAT often...
•THIS IS THE QUIET FLOOR. DO NOT HAZE YOUR PLEDGES ON THE QUIET FLOOR. DO NOT BLAST YOUR STUPID MUSIC ON THE QUIET FLOOR. DO NOT FALL ASLEEP AND SNORE ON THE QUIET FLOOR. I HATE YOU ALL.

Unfortunately, the combination of multiple tests, assignments and presentations plus being at home for Thanksgiving Break prevented me from exploring any type of secondhand store here in the DMV. 
Yet, while at home, I trekked over to my old standby thrift store and found quite a few great sweaters at unbeatable prices. I began to think: Is there a secret strategy to finding great treasures while out at a thrift store? Well, no, I suppose it’s not really a secret. 
There are a few factors, and I am here to share them with you so that you may hit the jackpot too next time you’re out at your favorite secondhand store.
1) Don’t shy away from basics
This may sound obvious, but it seems that every time I take new people to a thrift store with me, they gravitate towards the unique and silly items, something they might not ever wear. It’s not awful to buy a quirky piece every once and a while, but one of the best things to look for at a secondhand shop is basic shirts, sweaters or even jeans that are in good condition. At least for me, it never made sense to spend good money on simple, solid-colored T-shirts; almost all of the ones I own have come from a thrift store, and they are decent brands such as Gap and J. Crew. You can find normal clothes at these stores if you have the right eye for them!
2) Always Think about Need vs. Want
Similar to the point mentioned above, people are drawn to the more eye-catching pieces, such as bejeweled sweaters or a plaid skirt. However, it is always important in any type of shopping excursion to think about need versus want. Even if you are at a secondhand shop and the clothing is likely cheaper than its original retail price, money is money — especially as a college student. Think about if you like the actual item and will wear it, or if you simply like the idea of having it hang in your closet and using it as a conversation starter.  Recognizing the difference will make your shopping trip more efficient and will leave you with more room in your drawers.
3) Shoes are DEFINITELY Not Off-Limits
One of the most common comments I have received from skeptical friends is, “Ew, you actually wear shoes from a thrift store? Isn’t that gross?” My only response to this is, while they might not be brand-new, there are ways to clean these shoes if you truly like them; and besides, you might miss something great if you don’t look! I have found brand-new Sperry Topsiders, along with some of the most unique (probably one-of-a-kind) pairs of Chuck Taylor high-tops I have ever seen at my favorite thrift shop. The bottom line is, don’t be afraid to check out or even purchase an item at a secondhand shop if you really like it.
