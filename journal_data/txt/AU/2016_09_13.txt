Empire of the Sun, Passion Pit and Sylvan Esso are coming to D.C. in early October to perform as part of the third annual All Things Go “Fall Classic” music festival on Oct. 8. 
Joining the headliners at the Navy Yard will be Christine and the Queens, Bishop Briggs, POP ETC, Sofi Tukker and Ace Cosgrove. 
Unlike other festivals of this scale, the Fall Classic doesn’t have artists all from one genre, and instead draws from a range of artists with different backgrounds and musical influences. Despite this variety, it seems as if most of the lineup can be placed into the realm of contemporary pop that relies on subdued dance music, catchy hooks and overproduced voice distortions. 
At some point over the past seven years, you have probably heard and learned the lyrics to at least one song by all of these artists, whether or not you knew it was by them (see: Alive, Coffee, Take a Walk, River, etc.). Bottom line: festival-goes should prepare themselves for 10 hours of accessible pop music with hints of electronic influences and the occasional song that everyone will know all the lyrics to. 
In a slight deviation from this Sunglass Hut lineup, All Things Go booked Ace Cosgrove, the Maryland rapper (who has performed at AU), to be the sole representative of the DMV hip-hop scene. 
Fans of Passion Pit will be particularly excited to hear the band is still performing at the festival, even after the indietronica group cancelled all four of their other shows scheduled for the coming months. 
Food from Takorean, Beefsteak, Buredo, Shake Shack and more vendors will be available. For more information on all the vendors, the venue and the voyage to Navy Yard, check out the Fall Classic website. Tickets are still available: $75 in advance, $99 day of and $150 VIP.
Even if it’s not pushing the envelope with its selection of artists, the All Things Go Fall Classic should be a fun day of listening to familiar music, enjoying local food and maybe even surprising this writer with its caliber of performances.

One of the first things I noticed when I stepped foot on this campus were the shuttles. They are the gateway from AU to the rest of D.C., where opportunities lay abundant and ready for the picking, and that is the message that these shuttles boast. 
Plastered across these shuttles is the reminder that 90% of AU students participate in an internship and if you don’t, then why’d you even come to this school? At least that’s what I asked myself. A large part of why I came to AU was for the unparalleled access to internships and career connections that I had been told were necessary to gain even a foot in the door. 
During my first semester, I was unaware of the truth surrounding competition and what that word meant to young, ambitious, scared college students. One internship during your college career meant nothing if you didn’t already have one before college even started and had five other extracurriculars to brag about. It was never about doing what you liked, it was about doing the most that you could and, more importantly, more than the person next to you. 
I received my introduction to this stress culture when I felt shame about the amount of clubs and extracurriculars I chose to take on in my first semester at school. I committed myself to one club, one that necessarily didn’t offer any edge to my career goals but helped me to find a place on campus with people who understood my personality and my values. It was a personal choice. I knew myself and how much I could handle, but this reassurance did not quell the catastrophic thinking to which I found myself succumbing to often. While this race to the top may be the unfortunate reality of the current job market, the toxic careerism that it breeds in universities adheres to a one-size-fits-all educational system that perpetuates ableism and classism. Because while this may be the reality of the work force, many students face a very different set of circumstances. 
Many families and individuals have made sacrifices in order to receive an education at AU, drawn to it by those same messages of internships and opportunities. But unless that internship or that research opportunity is paid, why is it assumed that everyone can afford to take advantage of it? The idea that you must have an internship in order to be competitive in the job market is a tactical move in class warfare. There are very few who can afford to be at a competitive institution with recognition for internship opportunities, such as AU, without substantial financial help. However, this aid does not include living expenses, causing many students to seek out additional jobs. This often leaves students with no time or money for an unpaid internship, not only making them perhaps less qualified in the job market but also subject to the feelings of stress and shame that come with the appearance that they are behind. 
Similar to students who struggle financially, the same situation also occurs when students who struggle with different mental health concerns have to pursue their academic goals at a slower pace than the majority of the student body. Four classes and an internship may be the absolute maximum one student can handle while others seek to load their schedules much more. Contrary to popular rhetoric, neither commitment load is better or worse than the other, because there is no generic model for what an educational path is supposed to entail. We as students have bought into this idea that each decision we make will directly impact our future. We understand the large amounts of stress and pressure being placed upon us and we accept it for what it is. 
Our classrooms are not platforms to pick out our competition, so please don’t treat them as such. We become enveloped in our own stress and forget that we are not the only ones who feel alone. We are all products of a system that has waged war on our abilities as students, so in remembering that, we must take care of each other.

The Undergraduate Senate’s Committee on Oversight and Accountability opened an investigation Sunday regarding the resignation of former Secretary Faith Rokowski. 
Rokowski vacated her position just over two weeks ago after announcing her resignation in late August. Last Sunday, President Devontae Torriente nominated Rosalie Black for the position, but the senate did not confirm her. The decision prompted new procedures for the next secretary’s appointment to be decided upon at yesterday's meeting, as well as the opening of an investigation into the cause of Rokowski’s resignation.
“The first time we nominated a secretary, the process of nomination was very rushed because we felt we needed to get a secretary in the first meeting of the senate,” Torriente’s Chief of Staff Josh Gutmaker said. “Since then, we realized that taking our time would be the best solution to this.” 
Interested candidates can now apply for the position via an online application. Once the application closes on Sept. 18, Torriente, Vice President Samantha Vervaeke and Comptroller Shannon McDermott will conduct interviews with candidates selected from that applicant pool, narrowing down the number of applicants to two or three, according to Gutmaker. There will then be able to get involved through SG-wide interviews  running Sept. 22 through 24. Torriente will nominate his appointee after those meetings. 
The new secretary will undergo job training from Sept. 25-30, and will take office on Oct. 1. As for the investigation into Rokowski’s resignation, the senate’s Committee on Oversight and Accountability will conduct the investigation in the hope of preventing a similar situation, according to Alexis Arnell, chair of the committee.
Arnell plans to contact each member of the SG executive board individually in the upcoming week and conduct interviews to learn as much as possible about what caused Rokowski to resign. Those members include Torriente, Vervaeke, Gutmaker, Comptroller Shannon McDermott and Interim Secretary Kris Schneider.
“We are really just looking to get more information on the issue at this point,” Arnell said. 
Arnell will also rely on students not involved in SG for information relevant to Rokowski’s resignation. She will publish the results of the investigation at the next senate meeting on Sept. 18. Senators will then discuss what steps to take following the investigation, though no definitive steps have been decided yet, Arnell said. The investigation will also be available on the senate website and Facebook page. 
news@theeagleonline.com 
Clarification appended: The original story’s headline misled readers to believe that the search for a new SG secretary was at the sole responsibility of the Undergraduate Senate. It has been updated to better reflect the collaborative nature of the search and confirmation process between the president and senate. The original story stated that the general senate body voted to open the investigation into Rokowski’s resignation. It has been updated to say that the Oversight and Accountability Committee voted to open the investigation, which does ultimately report to the senate at large. The original story stated that the president and vice president will conduct the interviews, it has been updated to also include the comptroller. 
Correction appended: The original story stated that Gutmaker said that Torriente did not follow the “traditional” method for nominating Black, which Gutmaker did not say. The statement has been removed from the article. The original story stated that the forums on Sept. 22-24 are open to the general student body, which they are not. It has been updated to state that they are open to all members of SG.

Forget Spider-Man—Donald Glover is the hero Atlanta needs. After a relatively quiet few years, Glover returns to television  with the show Atlanta on FX. The show succeeds at providing a more grounded, realistic side of the African-American community, one that is more reminiscent of The Wire than a Tyler Perry show. Glover, who is known for his role in the cult show Community, as well as doubling as alt-rapper Childish Gambino, wrote the show’s first episode and stars as its protagonist, Earn, short for Earnest. 
Glover’s show portrays a grittier look at what it’s really like to be a rapper who blows up over night, something that seems all too common in the era of social media. Not only does the show illustrate the less than glamorous side of street rap, but it is one of the few shows on television to both focus on African-American characters  and portray their experiences honestly. The world of the show is fully realized and lived in, with a litany of funny and hip cultural nods. For example, the show’s comic relief character, Darius, reads a Vibe article that says “John Boyega is the new Magic Johnson,” a comparison so ridiculous that it could be pulled straight out of a hip-hop and “culture” blog’s article. 
While Donald and his brother Stephen co-wrote the believable dialogue, the first two episodes fail to stray from a traditional TV plot beat. Despite being a show that tries to convey what it’s really like living and struggling in Atlanta’s lower-income neighborhoods, the set up for these two episodes is something that could be found on Sons of Anarchy. Glover’s rapper cousin, Paper Boi, gets in an altercation and ultimately fires a gun, all in the first few minutes of the show—which may be a reality for some in Atlanta’s rap scene, but reminds the viewer that this is still television. 
Unlike another big hip-hop show, Empire, a soap-operaesque look at life as a music mogul in New York, Atlanta shows the human side of the rap game. Having family ask you for money, having to move away from your current home and taking pictures with moms are all realities that new-school rappers like Lil Uzi, Lil Yachty and Young Thug have had to deal with over the past several years. The show is coming out at a time where everyone with an iPhone is instantly aware of the next big thing in rap, but might not care to look into the musicians day-to-day realities.
The white radio DJ in the show, originally supposed to be played by Peter Rosenberg, a big time radio personality, has a moment that is entirely too believable: saying “nigga” to Glover’s character as they exchange barbs in a parking lot. We’ve all witnessed people speaking a certain way to some as opposed to others, but Glover’s subtle facial expressions and charming, dorky swagger makes it all the more funny. 
Part of me wishes that the shooting and its aftermath was replaced by another story arc, something that feels as relatable, yet uniquely Atlanta, as many of the show’s scenes. The relationships that Earn has with other characters hint at enough backstory and are convincing enough to the point that I could see any number of everyday scenarios that lead to Glover’s character becoming his cousin’s manager or being put in the doghouse by his child’s mother.
Mr. Glover’s knack for understanding the minutiae of the braggadocious nature of hip-hop culture is acute, as exemplified by Earn’s coworker at the airport when he talks about popping bottles in the club, despite making $5.15 an hour. One of the strong suits of the two episodes is that the viewer gets to see both the highs (taking a picture with the police officer who locked up infamous Atlanta rapper Gucci Mane), and lows of being an overnight sensation (having to move houses because you are now a target for a home invasion).
Donald Glover gets rap. He understands its inner workings, its trials and its tribulations. He himself evolved from an angsty mixtape-rapper into someone who was willing to take creative risks, like with his album ‘Because the Internet,” or just go flat out hard on his project ‘Royalty.’ However, the show doesn’t deal entirely with the hop-hop world. Earn’s struggles with women, his parents and having a child shows a realism that Glover was not able to showcase as the over-the-top Troy on Community. His writing prowess, the show’s immediately interesting characters and the talented cast are what will keep viewers engaged, even if the plot hits predictable (break) beats.

Did Travis Scott return from the “Rodeo” too soon? Just a year after putting out his last full length album, “Rodeo,”  G.O.O.D. Music affiliate and Houston based rapper Travis Scott returns with his second album “Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight.” 
While the album has the glitzy, bass-heavy, trap-influenced production that we have come to expect from a Travis Scott project, the heavyweight list of producers on the album, including the legend Mike Dean, Boi-1da and Cardo, much of the album ends up feeling like darker, grimier leftovers from Scott’s last album.
The album’s title, coined by Atlanta rapper Quavo, a member of the trap-rap group Migos, references the R&B crooner Brian McKnight, a man last relevant when Travis was still in middle school. McKnight’s most obvious influence on Scott is the range of vocals that were sung on his projects, which can be seen in the heavy distortion and auto tune used to manipulate Scott’s already raspy voice. 
Like his fellow trap contemporaries Young Thug, Lil Yachty and Migos, the product quality, creative spark and lyric writing tend to take a backseat to fans’ seemingly insatiable desire for more content. Time and time again rappers fall into the cycle of releasing a project every six to 12 months, and while the singles might sell, the idea of a cohesive and interesting body of work seems to get lost in the shuffle.
With the first single from “Birds in the Trap” arriving nearly nine months in advance, limited promotion and a release date that kept getting pushed back, it’s easy to understand why this album has not gotten the attention that Scott’s last one did. For an artist who seems to be doing almost nightly shows (Scott did stadium tours with both The Weeknd and Rihanna within the past year), it’s easy to see how he and Dean might have decided to stick with the same general sound as his previous album.
Scott, known for bringing together a litany of industry and underground elite for projects, continues that trend with his latest album. The first song, “The Ends,” has an absolutely killer verse from ATLien André 3000, and later in the tracklist, rap king Kendrick Lamar drops a show stealing, earth-shattering verse. 
Although Scott is credited as a writer throughout the album, the Houston native has never been known for his lyrics. His best songs have almost exclusively been club anthems featuring ferocious energy, over-the-top lines and memorable ad-libs, more akin to Three-Six Mafia than Lauryn Hill. Sadly, the mostly mundane features and often sappy or corny lyrical outputs from Scott and his colleagues create far too many songs that can be skipped on the tracklist.
One of the main issues that the album faces comes down to the lack of memorable moments on the project. The production varies little from song to song and after a while, songs about drugs, guns and money tend to blend together. Without the intensity, creative ad-libbing and clever hooks that appear on some of Scott’s older work, the album feels like leftovers from other projects that didn’t make the cut, creatively. 
Easily the most enjoyable, fun song on the album is the second single, “Pick up the Phone.” Arguably the song of the summer, it features outlandish, clever lyrics, such as “hit 'em with three like I'm Miller, I don't talk to no man in the middle I don't talk to no man, I'm just kiddin',” aided by a great hook and an infectious island-influenced beat. Outside of this poppy club banger, there really is no equivalent, instrumentally, to some of the hits from Scott’s previous album. The murky filled haze that is this album could have benefitted from more instrumental variety and a cleaner, less repetitive sound.
The album deals with a slightly more jaded, melodramatic Scott than last time around. On “Rodeo,” Travis rapped about his rise to fame, his raging desire for success and channeling his large amount of energy into music and various illegal vices. 
Now in the upper echelon of the rap world, Travis spends more time talking about the figurative (and literal) highs and lows of being a rap superstar. That could be interesting if this was an original concept for trap/club-rap, had some more memorable moments from Travis or if there was more experimentation in the production like there was on “Rodeo”—sadly none of this is present on this album.
Scott’s albums’ wings are clipped by the sameness of the dark, heavy production that, combined with repetitive themes and delivery, makes for a mostly enjoyable experience, but not one that provides any reason to listen twice.

Last Thursday, Student Government launched the AU TurboVote campaign in an effort to register every student to vote in time for the general election in November.  
SG is relaunching its partnership with TurboVote, a national platform specifically aimed at young people with the goal of increasing their civic engagement. 
After signing up online, the TurboVote application provides individualized information and updates for upcoming elections, voter registration and absentee ballots.
“The AU TurboVote campaign is one of the most ambitious voter registration plans ever in a college across the country,” said Valeria Ojeda-Avitia, Director of the Kennedy Political Union and coordinator of AU TurboVote.
The campaign has 25 campus partners, including the Undergraduate Business Association, the Interfraternity Council and the Intercultural Greek Collective, with the intention to expand, according to Ojeda-Avitia. TurboVote is also committed to non-partisanship, and the campaign is collaborating with both the AU College Democrats and AU College Republicans. 
“Voting is one of the most important facets of being an American citizen, and AUCRs is proud to do its part in encouraging civic duty by participating,” President of AU College Republicans Tom Herbert said.
The campaign will be tabling on campus throughout September, with heightened campaign efforts expected on National Voter Registration Day, scheduled on Sept. 27. 
Individuals can access TurboVote online, and can also become an AU TurboVote Ambassador and help spread the message. Ambassadors work to register voters and visit AU clubs and Greek life organizations to help groups register, according to TurboVote Ambassador Yazan Hanouneh.
"I became a TurboVote ambassador to ensure that every AU student has the opportunity to vote even while they're far from home,” Hanouneh said. “Whether you're a Democrat, Republican or something else, it is important to be civically engaged and participate in the system of democracy that keeps our nation running. In the end, this work is worth it since we'll have a more representative government that all students will feel like they helped elect."
