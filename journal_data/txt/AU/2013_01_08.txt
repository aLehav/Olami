Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) 3E chairman Matthew Frumin, who represents Tenleytown and Friendship Heights, launched his campaign for a vacant city council seat in a special election slated for April 23. 
Frumin recently played an active role in negotiations among AU officials and community leaders to help pass the expansion of Tenley Campus.
Frumin is running for the seat that will be vacated by D.C. Councilmember Phil Mendelson, who will become the new Council chairman this month following Chairman Kwame Brown’s resignation last year.  
The local politician is one of the first candidates to launch his campaign in a crowded race. As of Jan. 3, 14 other people had announced their bid for the fifth at-large seat, according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections & Ethics. 
Contenders include former at-large candidates Michael A. Brown, A.J. Cooper and Patrick Mara, who all will have a second chance to win a Council position after losing to independent David Grosso this past November. 
Despite the competition, Frumin remains confident in his campaign. 
“I’ve been very active on lots of issues,” he said, citing his advocacy on development and transportation. 
Education will also be top priority for Frumin if elected. The former Bill Clinton staffer helped modernize Woodrow Wilson High School and wants to expand resources for underprivileged students across the district.
“We need to replicate the success in parts of the city throughout the city,” he said.
Frumin, who ran for Congress in his home state of Michigan in 2000, hopes his leadership capability will give him an edge in the race.
“I have experience on many of the key issues that confront our city,” he said.

• @"You are a moron."
I will take a dump on your face. Then I will kiss you because your mom said "If you have nothing good to say then take a dump on their face then kiss your enemy and the matter will be settled." #Trustory #Blessed #YOLO 
• @"Dude I legitimately lol'd....Wit. I like it. Can the funny people be more outgoing? We'd all benefit."
Jason Aldean is rapping on my television right now, but I wrote that and many other classic rants which I'm compiling into a book called "Don't Put That Thing Where I Think You're Planning on Putting It." Ryan Seacrest looks despondent not having frosted tips anymore. Wait, what? Anyway, nice to know my bits of humor are appreciated. Happy New Year!
• I got my first kiss on the first day of 2013. Happy New Year's indeed!
• My resolution for 2013 is to not end 2013 the in the same state I went into it—desperately single. It was also my resolution for 2012 and 2011...maybe this year will be different. 
• HAHAHAHA to the caucasian club playing croquet and eating egg salad 
• I'm pretty sure I've spent at least an hour with my boyfriend almost every single day of break. Going back to long distance while we're both at school is going to be tough :/
• that awkward moment when you're Whitney Port's biggest fan
• still love period poops.
• I've only been abroad 1 day and I hate it here already.
• My brother is making a way stronger push to get sober after Sunday's episode, but withdrawal has been brutal. Every single minute he needs help not to use. I am 100% happy to be able to be here and help, but being on duty 24/7 has just been draining. Couldn't do this without the people who have helped hold me up from afar.
• Reddit is filled with racists and pedophiles. Read /r/circlebroke or SRS.
• I've put some thought into my new year's resolutions.  I want to, mainly, stop hating myself so much. I'm awesome and cooler than I think i am and I've got to stop focusing on the negative and think good thoughts about myself, right? Gotta stop giving a crap about what society and people and all that think about me 'cause I'm already 20 and I don't think I've actually started living for myself yet. I can do this.
• @why does it mean if you enjoy high school more than college: it means you peaked in high school an it's all down hill from there
• How many messages a day on okcupid is a good amount?
• Eagle rants needs upvotes/downvotes. Although I think I'd downvote nearly everything here.
• I miss her so much; the loneliness without her is too great. The winter nights too dark.
• We don't need no damn Caucasian Club, we just need the minority agitprop people to shut up and go away.
• I'm so lonely I buy chocolates that say nice things to me inside the wrapper so that I feel like someone cares.
• @ "An alumni just told me that AU used to be a party school..."
The alumnus/alumna you mentioned probably attended AU many years.  AU has been going experiences rapid changes lately.  I bet the alum you mentioned would be shocked that current AU students can't properly differentiate between alumnus/na and alumni.
• “And in comes some guy with a triple play Mean Girls eagle rant, looks like that'll get him some pretty good recognition, don't you think so Pat?"
"Absolutely John the resubmitting funny lines from popular movies is a good tactic for popularity if done right, this person certainly seems to know how to control their internet karma flow"
• Oh lord do attractive girls go for nerdy guys or are we merely kidding ourselves?
(bonus points to whoever gets the movie reference)
• I hate being in the house where my parents live. I want to be home in DC.
• I honestly don't care about what Azealia said. She is still queen and her music is still basically gay anthem lesbihonest.
• Despite staying sober, my brother has sharply spiraled downwards in terms of mental health over the past few days.  He's having severe anxiety and hallucinations, thinking he has a time machine and being afraid that the nurses are corpses.  Addiction used to be his only problem, but that's small time in comparison.  I used to think he was the strongest man in the world, and it’s terrible to see him reduced to this.  Those of you who fought with your family over vacation, please don’t waste your time with them while you still have it.  Love you bro.  
• After three whole wonderful weeks of seeing my boyfriend almost every single day, I now have to go back to the normalcy that is our long distance relationship. 
• @what would your activities be? playing croquet and eating egg salad sandwiches with the young republicans? or is that…RACIST!?!111.   Wel, what does the Black Student Alliance do? Drink grape soda, conplain ablut qhite people, and eat chicken wings with young liberal democrats, or is that RACIST?
• Why does everybody at AU feel that only white people are racist? Are you deaf to every black person who complains about 'white privilege'?  Just because an institution of racism existed 50 years ago, doesn't mean everybody is racist today- give us a break with this privilege crap already....
• wow ...reading all of these again made me realize how much better life is after college. don't worry everyone, it gets wayyyy better
• Being white is top notch.  Really, there are about zero drawbacks to it.
• Bleeeeeaaaaaaaaaarrrggghhh.
• Thats fine dont post eagle rants when you're supposed. It's not like it isn't your job or anything...
• Editor...you are slacking on the rants! Each Monday you said you would post it up...it's Tuesday and rants from last week are still up.... :(
[Editor’s Note: I sincerely apologize to both you and the significantly angrier/snarkier person above you]

President Barack Obama gave a message of optimism about the efforts of Americans recovering from Hurricane Sandy as he and his family lit the National Christmas tree on Dec. 6 for the ceremony’s 90th anniversary. 
“This holiday season is especially difficult for families who lost everything in the storm,” Obama said.  “But it’s also a time for us to be grateful for the heroism and perseverance of ordinary men and women in the storm’s path who’ve showed us that Americans will always be stronger than the challenges that we face.” 
Actor Neil Patrick Harris (“How I Met Your Mother”) hosted the ceremony and joked with the president and actor Rico Rodriguez (“Modern Family”) about going on vacation to Hawaii with the First Family. 
Singers Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds, Ledisi, Jason Mraz, Colbie Caillat and James Taylor performed Christmas songs with groups such as The Fray, the Midtown Men, Washington Performing Arts Society gospel choir and the U.S. Navy Band Commodores on the Ellipse.
A cappella groups such as Da Capo, the reigning champion of the National Harmony Sweepstakes a cappella contest, and the local Georgetown Day School Singers performed Christmas carols as part of the pre-show entertainment.
