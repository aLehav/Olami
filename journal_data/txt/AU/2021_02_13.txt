It’s the middle of February, which means that Valentine's Day is coming up. Whether you’re completely repulsed by Valentine’s Day or counting down the days until this holiday of love and chocolates, I think you’ll find a book on this list that meets your needs. 
“The Vanishing Half” by Brit Bennett
This book focuses on familial love. Covering almost 40 years of generational history, Brit Bennett does an extraordinary job of weaving together multiple storylines to create something compelling. Starting in 1968, in a small, southern Black town, the 16-year-old Vignes sisters decide to move to New Orleans. Fast forward 10 years and the twin sisters are living entirely different lives as two different races. Desiree and her daughter, Jude, find themselves back in that same southern town, while Stella is passing as a white woman with her daughter and husband in California. As the years pass and their paths cross, the reader is exposed to two divergent existences. This book is hard to put down; each character is unique, but the bond between the sisters remains strong. 
“Beach Read” by Emily Henry 
If you want cheesy romance for your Valentine’s Day, this is the book for you. The main character, January, is a romance writer and has locked herself away in her father’s beach house to complete her next novel. To break up the monotonous days of writer’s block, she decides to head into town to a bookstore to gain some inspiration. Instead, she runs into Augustus, a literary fiction writer and the student at the top of her college class. Coincidentally, he also struggles with writer’s block and has decided to lock himself in the beach house neighboring hers. They find themselves challenging one another to trade genres. As the reader, you follow the two of them as they help one another complete their novels and grow a bond over the summer. Playful and steamy, this book is fun and easy to read.   
“Call Me by Your Name” by André Aciman
I know you’re shocked to see this book on the list, but it truly is one of my favorite romances. André Aciman has an incredible way of describing infatuating first love and a hot summer’s day in Italy, told through the perspective of Elio, a young boy falling in love for the first time. Throughout the book, you are in Elio’s mind: smelling the fresh fruit from his Italian villa’s orchard, feeling the sweat drip down his back as he rides through the streets of Crema on his bike, feeling his heart skip a beat when his father’s summer research assistant, Oliver, enters a room. This is the book to read if you want to be transported somewhere — anywhere but here. 
“Conversations with Friends” by Sally Rooney
Though Sally Rooney’s second novel, “Normal People,” became a critically acclaimed and widely loved TV show adaptation, her first novel “Conversations With Friends” is the one I prefer. If you enjoyed watching Marianne and Connell from “Normal People” on screen, you should check out her story following college lovers and spoken word poets, Frances and Bobbi. Now just friends, the book follows the two as they become close friends with a married couple, Melissa and Nick. Melissa is a trendy journalist writing a piece on Frances and Bobbi’s spoken-word performances. But, things get complicated when Nick and Frances grow a strong attraction to one another. Pick up this book if you want to read about a love that is wrong, but feels right. 
“Writers & Lovers” by Lily King
Casey Peabody is recovering from the sudden passing of her mother and a recent love affair. She now works in a stuffy, affluent restaurant in Harvard Square, but wants to live a more creative life. This sentiment feels out of reach because she hasn’t been able to write anything substantial since her mother passed. She soon finds herself stuck between two new lovers. Overwhelmed with having to choose, she realizes that she has to evolve internally before she can pursue a new love. King’s writing is truly something special and sucked me in from the very first page. This book blends the aspects of a classic romance with the question of how to love internally. 
Whether or not you have a Valentine of your own, I hope you can fall in love with at least one of these characters.

There’s a scene in Noah Baumbach’s “The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)” that I always think about — a moment that only a person with siblings can truly understand. 
“The Meyerowitz Stories” follows three siblings and their relationship with their father in adulthood. Danny (Adam Sandler) is the main character and his story takes up the majority of the plot, but his sister Jean (Elizabeth Marvel) and her story toward the end of this movie are what really fascinate me. It is a moment that finally unwraps the box that contains the relationship between these three siblings and their father. 
The movie starts with the eldest brother Danny in the car with his daughter Eliza (Grace Van Patten) driving up a crowded 47th street in Manhattan. This scene always reminds me of my mom. She’s from the Bronx and learned how to drive there, so she comes with serious road rage and the amazing ability to parallel park, just like Adam Sandler’s character.
The scene ends with a dramatic jump cut from Sandler yelling at a car passing by to them arriving in his father’s beautifully decorated apartment in lower Manhattan. His father, Harold Meyerowitz (Dustin Hoffman) is a greying, irritable, classic New Yorker and a sculptor past his prime. They talk about his past works at the dinner table where they have been joined by Jean and Maureen (Emma Thompson), their stepmother. At this dinner, we begin to get a feel for the unusual relationship Danny and Jean have with their father as he makes passive-aggressive remarks about how none of his children were very passionate about the arts. This is also the first time we hear about the third Meyerowitz, Matthew (Ben Stiller). He lives in California and works in corporate finance, which Harold distastefully says he knows nothing about. 
Fast forward within the film and Harold is riding the line between life and death in an upstate New York hospital. This is the first time all three Meyerowitz siblings are together in years. As they unpack out of their car to see their sick father, Danny recognizes an old family friend of Harold’s who is going to visit him on his deathbed. At this same moment, we see Jean start running toward the woods behind the hospital. Danny and Matthew look at one another, both confused, and follow her. Once they catch up to her, Jean explains why she acted this way. She shares a short and painful story with her brothers for the first time. 
On a family trip many years ago, Jean was molested by her father’s friend. She explains to her brothers how she told her father what happened in the moment but was told that she would be okay and to go play and forget about it. 
Her brothers are in disbelief and feel terrible that they did not know about this sooner. With their heads held low, they lean toward Jean to hug and comfort her. She says impassively, “I’m going for a smoke” and removes herself from the hug. This isn't because she doesn't appreciate their gestures of empathy; it's just exactly how siblings would react in this moment. This specific scene resonated with me because I shared a room with my sister for 18 years of my life and got a fist bump as a goodbye when she dropped me off at college. I love my siblings, but no we don’t hug.  
Baumbach does an incredible job diffusing the tension of this uncomfortable conversation through the direction of their mannerisms. The shrug of Jean’s shoulders and the looks on Danny and Matthew’s faces is something I think about often. Frequently in movies when a character speaks about something that happened in the past, the movie cuts to a flashback of that very moment. A scene will play out in front of you of a younger actress playing a much younger Jean but Baumbach does not do that here. He lets the viewer hear Jean tell her story without you having to see what exactly happened because all that truly matters is what Jean has to say about it now. Elizabeth Marvel has the ability to show her discomfort toward the situation in her voice and the tension on her face making a flashback scene unnecessary. 
Immediately following this moment, Danny and Matthew, out of pure shame for not being able to do anything sooner, destroy this old man's car. Jean exclaims, “I could smash every car in this parking lot and burn the hospital down and it wouldn’t un-f--- me up”. 
Again, Jean has to remind them that there is nothing they can do now that will fix the past, but siblings will try their best regardless. I know mine would.

Multiple American University alumni began their positions in the administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris following the historic inauguration on Jan. 20.
Michael LaRosa, who earned a master’s in political science and government from the School of Public Affairs, serves as the press secretary to First Lady Jill Biden. Most recently, LaRosa worked as the chief spokesperson and traveling press secretary to Jill Biden during the 2020 campaign. 
LaRosa attended AU immediately after completing his undergraduate degree at Seton Hall University. LaRosa spent his days on Capitol Hill working full time as an executive assistant to former Rep. Melissa Bean, D-Ill., and his nights taking graduate classes. 
“In my second year of graduate school, I took a class called Voting Behavior. It had a profound impact on how I processed why people vote and what factors they consider before making up their minds,” LaRosa said. “It developed my understanding of voters, how they reason, and the importance of the media and campaigns on voter attitudes which ultimately affect how they vote.”
LaRosa said his classes had a substantial impact on his career. He and his favorite professor, Masaki Hidaka, who taught The Presidency, are still in touch today. 
“He has the right combination of being responsive, responsible, generous, loyal and smart. And I think that's what you need in his role,” Hidaka said. “You have to believe in the person you work for, and so I know that he believes in Dr. Biden, and that is going to make him even better at his job.”
After receiving his master’s degree from SPA, LaRosa worked as a producer for “Hardball with Chris Matthews” for six years and then went on to work for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as deputy director for the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. 
Shuwanza Goff, who earned a master’s from SPA, is also familiar with working in the House. 
Goff serves as the White House deputy director of legislative affairs and liaison to the House. Goff spent most of the past 12 years working in various capacities for House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. 
Goff broke racial barriers in 2019 as the first Black woman to serve as floor director. 
Goff’s work in the House has earned her the reputation of a highly experienced and talented individual who has become an expert on the legislative process, Hoyer said in a press release on Nov. 23. Pelosi also released a statement following Goff’s nomination. 
“Over twelve years of working for Leader Hoyer, Shuwanza has distinguished herself as effective and experienced and has earned the bipartisan respect of Members and staff across the aisle and across the Capitol,” Pelosi said.“In the White House, she will continue to be an effective force, as she coordinates and strengthens the work of the Biden-Harris Administration and Congress to deliver For The People.”
Thomas Winslow, who earned a bachelor’s from the School of Communication, is Biden’s senior adviser to the deputy chief of staff. Winslow worked as the chief of staff to the campaign manager during Biden’s campaign.
Melanie Nakagawa, who earned a law degree from the Washington College of Law, is Biden’s senior director for climate and energy. Before joining the Biden administration, Nakagawa, who also earned a master’s from the School of International Service, worked for Princeville Global as the head of climate initiative. 
Prior to Princeville Global, she served as a strategic adviser for then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry’s Policy Planning Staff. 
Following Nakagawa’s appointment, Kerry congratulated her on Twitter.
“Thrilled to see Melanie Nakagawa joining the NSC on climate,” he tweeted “She's seen and done so much on this issue, from the Senate and to the State Department, and will be a terrific team member addressing the climate crisis.”
