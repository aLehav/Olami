•yesterday I purposely turned the encyclopedia on the first floor of the library to page 1089.



•There is this guy who kind of looks like a young hot Robert Downey jr...thick glasses and everything....but I can't tell if he's gay or just another hipster. So RDJ lookalike, if you aren't gay, make eye contact with me at TDR and let's watch iron man together.
•@person annoyed about sniffling: It is my biggest pet peeve when people are annoyed at people who sniffle. It's a frickin bodily function, it's not a bomb exploding in your face.

•editor, I'm sorry your so sad. in al honesty these rants SOMEWHAT remind me of last year. I think it's just last year we had police blotter, collegeacb, and more active userson LAL that funny stuff around campus got posted on here.

-Etc...
So, let's get this nice and crystal clear: play nice, play fair, and don't be a complete tool. Sincerely,

•If Greece defaults on their debt, what does that mean for Greek Life!?!
•@"Wow, Clark and Roper Halls were the ones that saved the most energy last month..." I'll have you know that students in both halls took the challenge quite seriously and purposefully reduced unnecessary electricity use, even going so far as to unplug the vending machines. So thanks for mocking us.
•Why is it that being a conservative at AU automatically makes everyone hate you? I'm not rude to you about your political beliefs, don't be rude to me about mine. And for the record, conservative =/= republican.
•That moment where you're hooking up with one of the 3 guys in your class and none of your classmates know.
•That awkward moment where a guy keeps inviting you over to watch movies when you aren't interested.
•If you missed the basketball game Monday night, you really missed out. People need to start going to games, our team is actually really freaking good!!
•"is it weird to ask a girl to go on a jog as a first date? i want it to be casual, but part of me doesnt think this is a good idea... feedback?" DO IT. if she likes jogging too! otherwise it could be awkward.
•"How the hell did I not ask you out? The opportunity practically presented itself on a silver platter and I didn't take it. I'm an idiot" next time! im sure you'll have another chance!
•Were you in IB in high school?  Wait, really?  I didn't realize you were, I guess I didn't hear you the first twenty times you mentioned it in class.  Stop thinking and acting as if you're better than everyone else.  You're not.  And also, stop answering other students' questions before the professor gets to them; I'm paying over $100 a class to learn from HIM, not some prissy-assed girl who thinks she knows more than the man with the Ph.D. in the front of the room.
•Dear next door neighbor: I'm super delighted you like playing electric guitar so much but it would be awesome if you could do it less than FIVE TIMES OR MORE A WEEK and maybe turn your amp down a little, plug in some headphones or realize that we hear you ALL THE TIME I especially enjoy it when you stop playing guitar and just start singing at the top of your lungs, it really brightens my day
•"I still think about you even though we haven't even seen each other..." This is intense but just adorable. Make plans to see this person again. I'm sure they want to see you too!
•Dear Professor,
I appreciate you assigning us a 3,000 word essay on an event that happened in North Korea during 2011..  and not teaching us a damn thing this semester.  This should be fun, because you know.. There is so much information available on an event from North Korea... in 2011... /sigh/
•Rob Battaglia resigned from the AUSG Senate...one less member to take themselves too seriously
•@Oregon pronunciation: I know how you feel. Signed, student from Arkansas
•I know how stressed out I am by the number of times I masturbate during the week.
•To the first date jogger-- depends on the girl, but I personally would worry that I"d be sweaty and gross while jogging. Maybe a walk instead? That's still pretty casual.
•Dear Roommate,
I love you but your biddie best friend has to go. Every time she visits our room, I want to scream...
Sincerely, love you not her.
•@dear person who wants to get to know me (the one who plays roller coaster tycoon)...do you love math?-- I love both!!!!!!!
•I hate classes where EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD is due the last day of the semester. Spread the misery out a little, please?
•Dear stupid giggling biddies,
The quiet floor is called the QUIET floor for a reason. Don't bring your unwanted noise here.
•@"I still think about you even though we haven't even seen each other for a long time..." I know exactly how you feel-- I ran into a guy who's that person to me this weekend. I had just convinced myself to give up but every time I see him... I can't V.V and I almost never see him.
•@The person from upstate NY-- I'm from Northern NY and I agree with you completely! Where I'm from it starts to snow on Halloween and doesn't stop til March at the earliest.
•The other day I was in CVS and I saw some guy smelling a bottle of shampoo, and I totally freaked him out by running up to him and telling him really excitedly that I do the same thing. Then he was embarrassed and said he was trying to do it all sneakily so no one could see...
•@The NAVY ranter-- Don't be hatin' on the Air Force. I'm a proud Air Force sister. The Chair Force saves the country one cup of coffee at a time ;)
•Don't re-download eagle secure.  Disconnect from the internet, connect to "connect2eaglesecure," wait, and then select "eaglesecure" from the available wifi options.  You may have the repeat this process if it doesn't work immediately.  Beats re-downloading though.
•How many double-spaced pages have you written for classes this past week?  Winner gets the right to b**** about it.  Bidding starts at 29 pages.
•Why hasn't the IT department been fired yet?
•To the girl in my M/TH American Political Parties class who doesn't shut up,
SHUT UP! Your answers and comments are incredibly drawn out and saying "like" and "um" every other word makes you sound dumb. Your 67-sentence answers can be condensed into 1-2.
Sincerely,
Somebody Who Would Rather Hear the Professor Speak
•You don't have to keep downloading SafeConnect. Just double click on it in your downloads folder. 2x faster at least.
•Also, person who pointed out I wrongly said "Timonese" rather than "Timorese": you misspelled "sanitation."
•meow from abroad.
mraow.
•So apparently AU's administrators like to fight statistics with statistics. Well, just because you give out X aid, and Y percent of students don't take out loans, doesn't change the fact that AU students graduate with the MOST DEBT IN DC. The answer is still plain and simple: AU IS NOT DOING ENOUGH.
•@"try to get laid right now" button: I don't know if that's true (i mean, that button probably exists year-round), but now that i've committed myself to focusing on studying and getting all my papers done , some guy who i've known for a while wants to  start going out. WITH TWO WEEKS LEFT IN THE SEMESTER. seriously, I admire his courage for asking me out and I do like him, but now isn't exactly the time to start a relationship!
•Yes, male biddies do exist. However, they frequently go by the title of douche, tool, or a$$ hole.
•Looking for a nice Jewish girl. A nice one. A cute smiley one.
•My career as an undergrad will be ending in 9 days, and somehow I've made it out of college without writing a paper longer than 10 pages. #winning
•You've got beef with the occupiers? Really? Making assumptions about what type of wood was used haha?!?! Get a grip. Let's hear the reasons...list them and perhaps we can educate you some.
•@I really hate animated movies! Why doesn't anyone want to watch gory horror movies with me?--Gory horror movies are the sh*t. I love being scared.
•@"Can someone please explain what guys find attractive in females? I've seen some rather unattractive ones get attention and I'm just not comprehending."
answer = S-E-X
•@ smoker who says I shouldn't complain because "you walk next to 2 busy streets where vehicles put out carbon monoxide": Actually I purposefully walk in the middle of campus rather than by the street so as to not set off my asthma. But because of jerk like you who pollute the air for others who do not wish to breath polluted air, I have no escape.
•Why is Disney World under construction. WHY!
•So let me get this straight, you think because cars pollute the air that justifies your smoking om campus and making otherwise clean air (no cars go through the quad) dirty. What kind of warped logic do you have? That's like saying well wars kill people all the time and to a much greater degree so me murdering someone is no big deal. STOP MURDERING MY LUNGS!
•People who claim to care about the environment, yet smoke, are the worse kind of hypocrites there are.
•@"Person who doesn't want AU to have a football team,
I feel like you must be a guy."
Actually, I' m a girl. A girl who likes going to school with smart/sensitive/intellectual guys, not bro-y jocks who act like a-holes and bully others because they use they think with their fists, not their minds.
•@ "Good Christians aren't Republican":  I've personally found Christianity to promote an ideology more in line with socialism and that the Republican ideology, especially about the economy, doesn't line up well with Christianity at all.  However, we shouldn't generalize all Republican Christians <3
•@"(but of course I have to come back...)" No one is forcing you to come back. If you don't want to be at AU, then we don't want you here.
AU is an f-ing PARADISE. Why don't you try going to military school for high school and then get back to me on how awful AU is. AU has at least 5 events with awesome speakers and free food EVERY SINGLE DAY. No other school I have every visited puts so much effort into student happiness.
-person who loves AU and dislikes complainers who like to complain for no reason
•The rodent situation is out of hand--Hughes Hall had 20 2FIX complaints for this entire semester, huh?  HA!  We've caught 3 mice in our room in the past week.  That doesn't count the first one we saw that prompted us call Maintenance for traps in the first place.  Our room isn't messy, folks.  So sick of this.
•I hope the students complaining about events in Katzen aren't scholarship students. Especially since they are planning on protesting events that thank those who donate money to the school so it can provide such scholarship. Because that would be ironic.
•@"That awkward moment when you are the ONLY one that does not want to go home" It's only one WHO not only one THAT. You are a human being. Human beings are WHOs not THATs. Items are THAT. YOU ARE NOT AN ITEM. LEARN THIRD GRADE GRAMMAR NOW!
•Nicholas Kristof is a god.
[Editor’s note: Agreed.]
•I am not a security threat. And my middle name is KURT, NOT FART.
•Just finished an 11-page paper.Nothing to rant about now. BOOYAH!!!!
•Clark and Roper saved so much energy during November because we lived in a dark hell for two months.
•What's good about sad? It's happy for deep people.
•*If you play acoustic guitar on the quad.... your TERRIBLE..... Animal Collective is not music, it's poison...
•It's three in the morning. I'm so spaced out from lack of sleep that ergativity actually makes sense.
•I wish it was socially acceptable to be naked all the time. Figuring out what to wear every day is a pain in the butt for indecisive people.
•Yes, it is 6 AM. Yes, I am belting You and I in the study lounge. Thanks finals week.
•I write a rant about not seeing you in a while. For having these feelings for you. And who do I run into in TDR that day, before Rants went up. But there was so much awkward silence...
•Hi I'm calling from AU, IT'S AN EMERGENCY!!!!!!!
•I. Will. Kill. The. Tech. Department.
WTF CAN'T THEY JUST MAKE THE INTERNET WORK. IT ISN'T THAT HARD. MY FUCKING HIGHSCHOOL MANAGED IT JUST FINE.
Just create a goddam system where the password for the internet is your student ID or something and stop making me download safe connect. If the internet works well enough to make me download something IT OBVIOUSLY WORKS WELL ENOUGH TO LET ME ON THE INTERNET.
•I just don't understand people sometimes. They just don't make sense. At all.
•Whenever I find the jerk who invented Eaglesecure, I'm gonna roast his chestnuts on an open fire.
•Scones all day erry day. #occupytdr
•I'm freaking out about whether I'm just tired and have a sore throat, or if it's mono (I hope I'm just overreacting...)
•Why does everyone else seem so damn interested in my love life? Like more so than I am? Is it really obvious I need to get laid or something?
•If anything, the sh*tshow that was my behavior this weekend showed me that I have the best friends ever. Thanks for keeping me sane through my scrimmage/putting up with my drunk biddiness, guys. Y'all are the best.
•As if running Safe Connect every other time I want to go online on my computer wasn't bad enough, I now have to do it on my phone. #eaglesecureproblems
•"Beware the Jabber WONK, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that snatch!"
•The Dav didn't have soy milk... A good coffee shop would have soy....
•I got a double shot latte by accident instead of a chai -- I don't usually drink caffeine. I'm going craaaazy. I'm sorry English class.
•Ever since our talk, there have been days when you're acting not like a friend and days where you are acting like a friend. I have had many, if not all people tell me that you are not worth it...not even the friendship. Too bad that I am my own person, and I am in this world for ME, and I advocate for myself. I see all the good in people, even if some may not. I believe there's good in you-I can genuinely see it. Do what you want, and forget the rest. You'll be happier listening to yourself.
•@Got any Sodium jokes: Who are you?! That's  my favorite meme! My roommate thinks I'm crazy :/

•"I still think about you even though we haven't even seen each other..." This is intense but just adorable. Make plans to see this person again. I'm sure they want to see you too!
•Dear Professor,
I appreciate you assigning us a 3,000 word essay on an event that happened in North Korea during 2011..  and not teaching us a damn thing this semester.  This should be fun, because you know.. There is so much information available on an event from North Korea... in 2011... /sigh/
•Rob Battaglia resigned from the AUSG Senate...one less member to take themselves too seriously
•@Oregon pronunciation: I know how you feel. Signed, student from Arkansas
•I know how stressed out I am by the number of times I masturbate during the week.
•To the first date jogger-- depends on the girl, but I personally would worry that I"d be sweaty and gross while jogging. Maybe a walk instead? That's still pretty casual.
•Dear Roommate,
I love you but your biddie best friend has to go. Every time she visits our room, I want to scream...
Sincerely, love you not her.
•@dear person who wants to get to know me (the one who plays roller coaster tycoon)...do you love math?-- I love both!!!!!!!
•I hate classes where EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD is due the last day of the semester. Spread the misery out a little, please?
•Dear stupid giggling biddies,
The quiet floor is called the QUIET floor for a reason. Don't bring your unwanted noise here.
•@"I still think about you even though we haven't even seen each other for a long time..." I know exactly how you feel-- I ran into a guy who's that person to me this weekend. I had just convinced myself to give up but every time I see him... I can't V.V and I almost never see him.
•@The person from upstate NY-- I'm from Northern NY and I agree with you completely! Where I'm from it starts to snow on Halloween and doesn't stop til March at the earliest.
•The other day I was in CVS and I saw some guy smelling a bottle of shampoo, and I totally freaked him out by running up to him and telling him really excitedly that I do the same thing. Then he was embarrassed and said he was trying to do it all sneakily so no one could see...
•@The NAVY ranter-- Don't be hatin' on the Air Force. I'm a proud Air Force sister. The Chair Force saves the country one cup of coffee at a time ;)
•Don't re-download eagle secure.  Disconnect from the internet, connect to "connect2eaglesecure," wait, and then select "eaglesecure" from the available wifi options.  You may have the repeat this process if it doesn't work immediately.  Beats re-downloading though.
•How many double-spaced pages have you written for classes this past week?  Winner gets the right to b**** about it.  Bidding starts at 29 pages.
•Why hasn't the IT department been fired yet?
•To the girl in my M/TH American Political Parties class who doesn't shut up,
SHUT UP! Your answers and comments are incredibly drawn out and saying "like" and "um" every other word makes you sound dumb. Your 67-sentence answers can be condensed into 1-2.
Sincerely,
Somebody Who Would Rather Hear the Professor Speak
•You don't have to keep downloading SafeConnect. Just double click on it in your downloads folder. 2x faster at least.
•Also, person who pointed out I wrongly said "Timonese" rather than "Timorese": you misspelled "sanitation."
•meow from abroad.
mraow.
•So apparently AU's administrators like to fight statistics with statistics. Well, just because you give out X aid, and Y percent of students don't take out loans, doesn't change the fact that AU students graduate with the MOST DEBT IN DC. The answer is still plain and simple: AU IS NOT DOING ENOUGH.
•@"try to get laid right now" button: I don't know if that's true (i mean, that button probably exists year-round), but now that i've committed myself to focusing on studying and getting all my papers done , some guy who i've known for a while wants to  start going out. WITH TWO WEEKS LEFT IN THE SEMESTER. seriously, I admire his courage for asking me out and I do like him, but now isn't exactly the time to start a relationship!
•Yes, male biddies do exist. However, they frequently go by the title of douche, tool, or a$$ hole.
•Looking for a nice Jewish girl. A nice one. A cute smiley one.
•My career as an undergrad will be ending in 9 days, and somehow I've made it out of college without writing a paper longer than 10 pages. #winning
•You've got beef with the occupiers? Really? Making assumptions about what type of wood was used haha?!?! Get a grip. Let's hear the reasons...list them and perhaps we can educate you some.
•@I really hate animated movies! Why doesn't anyone want to watch gory horror movies with me?--Gory horror movies are the sh*t. I love being scared.
•@"Can someone please explain what guys find attractive in females? I've seen some rather unattractive ones get attention and I'm just not comprehending."
answer = S-E-X
•@ smoker who says I shouldn't complain because "you walk next to 2 busy streets where vehicles put out carbon monoxide": Actually I purposefully walk in the middle of campus rather than by the street so as to not set off my asthma. But because of jerk like you who pollute the air for others who do not wish to breath polluted air, I have no escape.
•Why is Disney World under construction. WHY!
•So let me get this straight, you think because cars pollute the air that justifies your smoking om campus and making otherwise clean air (no cars go through the quad) dirty. What kind of warped logic do you have? That's like saying well wars kill people all the time and to a much greater degree so me murdering someone is no big deal. STOP MURDERING MY LUNGS!
•People who claim to care about the environment, yet smoke, are the worse kind of hypocrites there are.
•@"Person who doesn't want AU to have a football team,
I feel like you must be a guy."
Actually, I' m a girl. A girl who likes going to school with smart/sensitive/intellectual guys, not bro-y jocks who act like a-holes and bully others because they use they think with their fists, not their minds.
•@ "Good Christians aren't Republican":  I've personally found Christianity to promote an ideology more in line with socialism and that the Republican ideology, especially about the economy, doesn't line up well with Christianity at all.  However, we shouldn't generalize all Republican Christians <3
•@"(but of course I have to come back...)" No one is forcing you to come back. If you don't want to be at AU, then we don't want you here.
AU is an f-ing PARADISE. Why don't you try going to military school for high school and then get back to me on how awful AU is. AU has at least 5 events with awesome speakers and free food EVERY SINGLE DAY. No other school I have every visited puts so much effort into student happiness.
-person who loves AU and dislikes complainers who like to complain for no reason
•The rodent situation is out of hand--Hughes Hall had 20 2FIX complaints for this entire semester, huh?  HA!  We've caught 3 mice in our room in the past week.  That doesn't count the first one we saw that prompted us call Maintenance for traps in the first place.  Our room isn't messy, folks.  So sick of this.
•I hope the students complaining about events in Katzen aren't scholarship students. Especially since they are planning on protesting events that thank those who donate money to the school so it can provide such scholarship. Because that would be ironic.
•@"That awkward moment when you are the ONLY one that does not want to go home" It's only one WHO not only one THAT. You are a human being. Human beings are WHOs not THATs. Items are THAT. YOU ARE NOT AN ITEM. LEARN THIRD GRADE GRAMMAR NOW!
•Nicholas Kristof is a god.
[Editor’s note: Agreed.]
•I am not a security threat. And my middle name is KURT, NOT FART.
•Just finished an 11-page paper.Nothing to rant about now. BOOYAH!!!!
•Clark and Roper saved so much energy during November because we lived in a dark hell for two months.
•What's good about sad? It's happy for deep people.
•*If you play acoustic guitar on the quad.... your TERRIBLE..... Animal Collective is not music, it's poison...
•It's three in the morning. I'm so spaced out from lack of sleep that ergativity actually makes sense.
•I wish it was socially acceptable to be naked all the time. Figuring out what to wear every day is a pain in the butt for indecisive people.
•Yes, it is 6 AM. Yes, I am belting You and I in the study lounge. Thanks finals week.
•I write a rant about not seeing you in a while. For having these feelings for you. And who do I run into in TDR that day, before Rants went up. But there was so much awkward silence...
•Hi I'm calling from AU, IT'S AN EMERGENCY!!!!!!!
•I. Will. Kill. The. Tech. Department.
WTF CAN'T THEY JUST MAKE THE INTERNET WORK. IT ISN'T THAT HARD. MY FUCKING HIGHSCHOOL MANAGED IT JUST FINE.
Just create a goddam system where the password for the internet is your student ID or something and stop making me download safe connect. If the internet works well enough to make me download something IT OBVIOUSLY WORKS WELL ENOUGH TO LET ME ON THE INTERNET.
•I just don't understand people sometimes. They just don't make sense. At all.
•Whenever I find the jerk who invented Eaglesecure, I'm gonna roast his chestnuts on an open fire.
•Scones all day erry day. #occupytdr
•I'm freaking out about whether I'm just tired and have a sore throat, or if it's mono (I hope I'm just overreacting...)
•Why does everyone else seem so damn interested in my love life? Like more so than I am? Is it really obvious I need to get laid or something?
•If anything, the sh*tshow that was my behavior this weekend showed me that I have the best friends ever. Thanks for keeping me sane through my scrimmage/putting up with my drunk biddiness, guys. Y'all are the best.
•As if running Safe Connect every other time I want to go online on my computer wasn't bad enough, I now have to do it on my phone. #eaglesecureproblems
•"Beware the Jabber WONK, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that snatch!"
•The Dav didn't have soy milk... A good coffee shop would have soy....
•I got a double shot latte by accident instead of a chai -- I don't usually drink caffeine. I'm going craaaazy. I'm sorry English class.
•Ever since our talk, there have been days when you're acting not like a friend and days where you are acting like a friend. I have had many, if not all people tell me that you are not worth it...not even the friendship. Too bad that I am my own person, and I am in this world for ME, and I advocate for myself. I see all the good in people, even if some may not. I believe there's good in you-I can genuinely see it. Do what you want, and forget the rest. You'll be happier listening to yourself.
•@Got any Sodium jokes: Who are you?! That's  my favorite meme! My roommate thinks I'm crazy :/

The men’s basketball team came into this season searching for someone to fill the void left by the departures of Vlad Moldoveanu and Stephen Lumpkins, the team’s top two scorers from a year ago.
Well, the Eagles found their answer.
Charles Hinkle, who averaged less than five points per game last season, has gotten off to a phenomenal start in 2011.
The senior is averaging 23.4 points per game through the first nine contests of the season, good for sixth in the nation.
“This summer, I put in a lot of work with my trainers and played a lot of pick-up games at UCLA,” Hinkle said. “All the work that I put in this summer is finally paying off.”
With Moldoveanu graduating, Lumpkins pursuing a baseball career and Troy Brewer’s ailing toe, Hinkle has also had more chances to score.
“Now that Moldoveanu and Lumpkins are gone, Charles has gotten more opportunities,” AU Head Coach Jeff Jones said. “Quite honestly, the fact that Troy is hurt has given Charles the opportunity [to score too], and he’s taken advantage of that. Good players, when you get the opportunity, step up and make the most of that opportunity, and he’s done that.”
Nearly all of Hinkle’s stats have improved from a year ago, especially his ability to get to the free throw line. 
His 10 free throws and 12 attempts per game rank among the best in the country.
“The number of times he’s gotten to the line is just incredible,” AU point guard Daniel Munoz said. “Even if he’s not having a good night shooting, he always gets to the line and finds a way to score.”
Although scoring is his primary contribution to the team, Hinkle leads the team in other ways as well. 
“Charles is a veteran guy, and he’s not just a scorer,” Brewer said. “He’s willing to do things that some guys aren’t willing to do, and guys look up to that, especially the younger guys.”
Learning behind a player like Moldoveanu, who signed to play with Italy’s Benetton Treviso this past summer, has helped Hinkle as well.
“Just learning from Vlad last year and how he carried the team definitely helped me,” Hinkle said.
Hinkle came to AU at the beginning of last year after spending two years at Vanderbilt University. 
Jones was a deciding factor in Hinkle’s decision to transfer to AU. 
“Coach Jones is a great coach,” Hinkle said. “I saw what he did in 2009, and I love the way he coached. I loved the style of play and how hard they played on defense.”
Although he’s only been at AU for a little over a year, Hinkle has already grown to be one of the leaders on the team.
“His personality is always positive, and he’s a good leader,” Munoz said. “When one of your best players is one of your hardest workers, it’s always a good thing.”
Hinkle’s style of play has continued to open up opportunities for his teammates through the early part of the season. 
“He’s done a great job of getting into the lane and forcing people to come over and help,” Munoz said. “He’s taken a lot of pressure off other guys, and, with him playing well, we’ve had a more balanced attack. He’s really helped us win some games.”
