Part 1

This week on The M&M Report, Devin Mitchell and Mark Lieberman discuss “Boyhood” and “Orange is the New Black.”
Written and directed by Richard Linklater, this epic coming-of-age tale spans twelve years in both narrative and production. Linklater wrote a shot a few scenes for the film each year from 2002 to 2013, finally putting the pieces together just last year after the release of his previous film “Before Midnight.” Mitchell and Lieberman both loved “Boyhood” and found much to recommend.
