•thank goooooooooooooooooooooood i already took my core courses in sis 
•revision from earlier rant ATV OUTREACH guy the blonde one.......get at me
•oh my goodness I just googled chork, mind blown! thanks earlier ranter!
•You're a tired, old b**** with an acrid personality and no likeable attributes or marketable skills now that your youth has faded. Mercifully for you, the rest of your miserable life will be short, likely ending soon in preventable illness. You curse me out all you want. Life is not going to get better for you ever again.
•So why didn't Wreck-It Ralph win the Oscar? Brave wasn't bad but Ralph is so clearly the superior movie.
•I should have seen this coming. 
•Crossed that off my bucket list -grins-
•Darn it, spring break is halfway over, and what have I done with my life in that time?
•SPRING BREAK DIARY DAY 6: I have killed all the cardinals and they have made me the new pope. I survived by hiding under Timothy Dolan's pants and eating the brains of another guy. I am a savage, but prepared for the job. I just hope they don't find out I'm Jewish. That might make things awkward since the last guy was a Nazi. On my way to Barcelona because I hear they are known for their world class lunch meats. 
•@"I'm not condoning your checking of the Eagle Rant whilst on vacation. Go on outside and socialize. (The break rants aren't event that good anyways)"
"Oh, yeah? You Marxist, liberal, fascistic, Nazi, Fruit-of-the-month club card carrying Obamazombie. "Socializing," Ha! That's what the Establishment LAMEstream media would like you to do. MORE GUNS. BUY GOLD. VOTE RON PAUL" - Rant by Bill O' Alex Jones Hannity Limbaugh Levin Savage Palin Rove Huckabee Cavuto
•NO, I AM TOO.: I ship it. and it is so frustrating trying to convince someone that they are more than friends/brothers/whatever who doesn't want to hear it/SEE the evidence. How do you argue against it?? I don't know if it will ever actually, happen though. Especially if we have Cas being the bad guy (even if it's against his will/he doesn't know it) again. Or, that means it will happen, because Dean will have to save him. heartsheartshearts.

•I'm a dick, but I didn't want to hook up with you

•I ship the two people making all the Supernatural references back and forth #getonthat

•cute promo guy at AUTV- get at me
•That moment when you prevent yourself from submitting a rant because you realize someone might figure out the identity of who wrote it.
•I am now going to make a fuss over the "no-fuss tiramisu" because I have no idea what marscapone cheese is or where to buy it.
•HTML fail. [Editor's Note: Whoops. Fixed.]
•SPRING BREAK DIARY DAY 5: Have locked myself inside the Vatican conclave. They have accepted me as one of their own. I brought my Iphone in my anal cavity so that I can communicate. There is no food or water. Four bludgeons hanging along the wall. A voice just filtered through the walls. "LET THE HUNGER GAMES BEGIN. AND MAY THE ODDS BE.." I'm firing my travel agent. [Editor's Note: We're glad you got video, too.]
•Ryan Gosling stars as a maverick movie critic for the New York Post who goes after a Asian baby gang ,the "Trilads," to get his girlfriend whom they have kidnapped and put into forced labor at their carnival "DUSNEYWURL" and back in time for a screening of the new Baz Luhrmann film. GOSLING IN "Drivel."
•AU's hypersensitive leftists need to go away, shut up, and stop being a self-parody. You can be on the left without getting offended at things that aren't actually offensive. 
•The Student Health Center is actually really fabulous if you think you're pregnant (IF you have AU's student health insurance and are able to pay the $40 copay for a visit and urine test). They have a wonderful, nonjudgmental family life health professional who will sit down with you, discuss your options, and help you make a plan. Just let them know when you make an appointment that the reason for your visit is a possible pregnancy. 
•Never submit passwords through Google Forms.
•I'm pretty sure Misha called dibs on Jensen Ackles, lol. #Cockles
•@FREAKING OUT: NO, I AM TOO.  Dean's prayer devastated me too!  And the preview was awful. Hellatus has been brutal. I've also been reading a lot of destiel meta (as far as possibly going canon goes), thoughts??
•WOAH the eagle rants are all red and hyperlinked. Neato. 
•I hope you're all enjoying your spring break...in the meantime SIS has changed everything which will lead to your eventual downfalls.  Happy registration
•@earplugs nope, they don't make it that quiet -- awesome, thanks! I'll definitely try it out when I get back to D.C.!
•They caught the AU Fondler. It was your mom.
