The new Happy Madison-produced film “Here Comes the Boom,” starring Kevin James (“Paul Blart: Mall Cop”) tricks audiences into thinking they’ve signed up for a cinema experience full of laughs. Only after the film is over do viewers realize they’ve been duped.
The conceit of “Boom” seems like exactly the kind of concept two inebriated men would come up with to find a way to buy more beer. Scott Voss (James) is a down-and-out, working class, tough-guy biology teacher who works at a dilapidated public school. When the principal (Greg Germann, “Fly Away”) announces that the school must cut programs, it endangers his job of his friend, the affable music teacher Marty (Henry “Fonzie” Winkler, “Happy Days”). Voss vouches for Marty to raise the money in any way possible.
Finding extra work as a teacher for future citizens, he comes into contact with a former mixed marshall arts trainer Niko (Bas Rutten, “Zookeeper”). While watching an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fight, Voss discovers he can make money fighting as an MMA fighter, thus finding a way to raise the money need to save the program.
As improbable as all this may seem, the suspension of disbelief needed to believe that James can fight the various mastodons he rumbles with is immense. The movie paints him as a man of many talents. He can draw complex cell systems, fight in MMA matches and inspire kids with music!
Rather than making any meaningful comedic turns, the film would rather ratchet up the slapstick and tone down the logic. Winkler’s character Marty is no more than a doddering old man and can apparently make a high school band comprised of moderately trained musicians sound like a 150 piece metropolitan orchestra. Niko is just as corny, hamming up his lines past disbelief into cringe-inducing levels of hokey boredom. 
Salma Hayek (“Savages”) plays a buxom health teacher whom James tries futilely to ask out on a date. Unfortunately, her one-dimensional character plays no larger a role than as James’s love interest.
Frank Coraci (“Zookeeper”) directs with a dyspeptic attitude toward balancing drama and comedy. The final fight contains impressive moments of cinematography. But considering most of the film is so mind-numbing, by the time the film arrives at the scene, it’s expended all its legitimacy. 
The plotting seems to grab every low-hanging fruit, dangling the story points like bait. The film seems less like an attempt to tell a story and more like a giant advertisement for UFC, as at many points UFC regular commentators like Joe Rogan and Mike Goldberg show up. 
“Here Comes the Boom” has no substance, lots of American jingoism and very little style. The script is composed of Orwellian inspirational quotes from school posters like “Don’t give up on your dreams” or “Follow your heart,” and the title song is played ad nauseam. It’s less knockout fun and more knock-you-out narcolepsy.

After wallowing for years as the bland leading man in a series of formulaic Hollywood efforts, Ben Affleck has recently re-established himself as a reputable director with ambitious, well-received pieces like “Gone Baby Gone” and “The Town.”
Affleck demonstrates his newly acquired talents with “Argo,” a sophisticated, taut suspense drama that employs real-life events to simultaneously exhilarate the audience and tweak Affleck’s beloved film industry. Likely to be a contender for several Academy Awards, “Argo” is gripping but not overly serious, smart but not overly complex, well-paced but not overlong. It’s just right.
The film begins in 1979 Iran, detailing relevant history through subtle animation. A stunning first sequence depicts an intense frenzy as Iranian protesters infiltrate the American embassy and take 52 Americans hostage. Six of the Americans manage to escape the Iranians’ clutches and find temporary refuge in the Canadian Embassy, but to leave from there would be to endanger their lives.
Back in D.C., CIA specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck) devises a risky and outlandish scheme to smuggle the hidden ambassadors out of militant Iran with minimum suspicion. With the help of Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman, “Trouble with the Curve”) and legendary producer Lester Siegel (a hilariously dry Alan Arkin, “The Muppets”), Mendez constructs the trappings of a fake science-fiction film called “Argo” and travels to Iran, where he hopes to transport the hostages disguised as a film crew.
“Argo” avoids many of the pitfalls of lesser thrillers. Its focus is tight, with no extraneous subplots to distract from the driving rescue narrative. The process-oriented script by Chris Terrio ignores melodramatic tendencies to focus on the simple problem of how best to retrieve the hostages, detailing necessary machinations like trade publications, script readings and publicity. Such buildup amplifies the power of the later, more action-oriented section.
The dialogue is sharp, with witticisms about the movie industry and Melendez’s drinking habits drawing surprisingly cathartic laughs amidst the pervasive tension. Affleck seems to be simultaneously mocking and celebrating his own industry, lampooning its tendency to produce schlocky science-fiction and foster unjustified egos while reinforcing the idea that movies, frivolous as they often seem, can make an impact.
The cast is superb. Affleck proves to be a capable (if not earth-shattering) lead, understated as a man who excels at his job even as his colleagues doubt him. Bryan Cranston’s intensity from “Breaking Bad” translates seamlessly into his role as Mendez’s boss, a man whose patience quickly wears thin. Goodman and Arkin, meanwhile, provide some of the film’s most vibrant comedic scenes; they are particularly adept at delivering several well-timed F-bombs and satirizing various Hollywood professions. 
Admittedly, “Argo” is not entirely original or even particularly surprising. The action sequences and dramatic conversations are compelling enough to offset much of the predictability, but the climax and denouement are far from shocking. Nonetheless, both pack a surprisingly emotional punch. Tony’s marital struggles, meanwhile, feel tacked on in a few obligatory scenes of Mendez moping generically, but the film’s moving conclusion and last line partially offset that unnecessary wrinkle as well. 
Affleck’s direction raises the suspense and accentuates the mood with such finesse that the relative lack of originality allows “Argo” to excel beyond conventional iterations of its genre.

• @Nietzsche being dead, you just made my day so much. Thank you for that.
P.S. Nothing matters. 
• @We will take our country back. Really? That's pretty divisive language coming from someone who seeks more acceptance. Honestly, as a dem, I'm usually intrigued by republicans. My question is "why?" Social views usually stem back to personal values. I can accept a difference of opinion there. But supply-side economics? The Laffer curve? C'mon.
• people in the group study room talking about some Dutch citizen and international law...what the freak are you going on about!? i can't tell if your project is really interesting or if my work is really boring
• TOUCH YOURSELVES EVERY DAY
• Editor, you're the freakin' bomb.  Don't listen to the haters.  And to whomever keeps ranting that the editor sucks, seriously, knock it off.  Obviously you've never been in a position to experience this, but people's feelings get hurt by that sh*t.
[Editor’s Note: Don’t worry, I don’t have feelings.]
• "I'm scared of getting loneliness induced psychosis." I'm scared for you, too, because I've been there and I know how much it hurts, feeling as if you could be saved if you could just find a single human connection but it's like you're a ghost, no one can hear you, so you send out anonymous messages online hoping that someone, anyone, will write back. so. I'm writing back. hi.
• I know, right? Humming people and whistling people... They are awful.
• Brohoof!  These Eagle Rants just got 20% cooler.
• poor humming girl man
• Anyone know of any good bungees you could use for the purpose of attaching an AU ID card to your belt? My roommate loses hers daily, and I feel a bungee cord of some type would rectify this problem.
• As a marsupial expert, I am very koalafied.
• I really need to get up and print something, but I can't move because I'm listening to xm on my computer and all my favorite songs keep playing.
• So, I know I'm pretty, but I like when you say it, so please don't stop anytime soon...
• Where the aspies at?
• I eat too much fro yo these days. I guess there are worse addictions, but fro yo in the Eagle's Nest is such a temptation.
• Dear guy sitting near the computers on the second floor of the library last night, you are unbelievably gorgeous. 
• I'm so sorry for whatever happens between us. I never planned for this to happen this way.
• No hot professors???
• I hate it when people say "what's good?" IT MAKES NO SENSE!! I'm always tempted to answer: puppies or cupcakes.
• To the person rating about Italy and France: you are seriouisly a tool.  No one cares and its annoying.  Find something better to do.
• Dear phonathon people...STOP F*CKING CALLING ME.  I gave this damn school 160k in tuition and I refuse to pay another dollar so that AU can redistribute my money to random minority students via scholarships.  Sincerely, an annoyed alumni.
• @beautiful/caring/strong/faithful Now we're all just curious... Come on, details :) 
• Ladies of AU, how big does a guy need to be in order to be considered "big?" 
sometimes i push the tip of my penis inward so it matches my belly button
• @plaid shoes girl: i think that was me, thanks!! I'm glad you liked them :D
• @Tavern at 3. Sorry, Mondays are no good for me. How about next Friday (10/19) sometime between 12:30pm and 2:30? And it's all good, I never got a confirmation so I didn't show up. 
• @Northern people are great, but I miss southern people....Who are you and where can I find you? I miss the south and southerners.
• I just want a boyfriend who understands my crushes on historical figures. No, I don't wish you were Alexander Hamilton, I just think he was a cutie. Get over it.
 • you suck editor! 
• @girl who is attracted to straight girls and girls with boyfriends - You need to stop being me, or come find me so we can be perfect and alone together.
• @ “There is a special place in hell reserved for people who don’t use eaglebucks or dining dollars when there’s a long line at Eagle’s Nest.” Um some of us are actually responsible enough to use real money and have real credit like big kids. Using eaglebucks is beyond stupid when almost every major credit gives you cash back.  I get paid $200 a month to use my credit card. So have fun getting zero cash back with your eagle bucks.  
• I wish this could be a happy song. But my happiness went away the moment you were gone.
• @”What if someone was about to kill themselves?” I don’t know about you, but I only have one self who could be killed. But perhaps this is why you are seeking help in the counseling center…
• I didnt ACTUALLY care or anything bro 
• He wants to be Aladdin
• @ 'a cracka helpin a sister out' ..............................................
really bro? Really. 
• Lol don't even bother texting me back. If you're reading this and think I may be talking about you. You're right I am. Put down the flip phone tiger, you've done enough damage for one day 
• I found a really good poop spot. I just thought I'd let you guys know ;)
• You made me physically sick with the amount of awkward you just created. I would congratulate you but I'm sure this is nothing out of the ordinary what with you being a straight male at AU and all
• I'd like to personally apologize for the country music in the dav.I wasnt there and I didn't make the playlist but I have a strong feeling I know who did and I definitely am the enabler in this situation so MY BAD I'm off to un-enable them now and save your ears
• Reading rants all calmly when you realize one might be about you...
• Cheers to the freakin weekend betches ;D
• @"Does anyone know of a nice place to meet attractive, smart gay men besides Town?" and @"Why can’t I find any attractive gay men on this campus? All the guys I seem to like are either straight, taken or a**holes…"
Agreed.  I’m on Grindr begrudgingly but haven’t actually met anyone (on campus) in person because I don’t want random sex, I’m not out, and to be honest I’m embarrassed I’m even on it.  At the risk of sounding like a total douche—I consider myself intelligent, genuine, masculine, and attractive.  Where are you two?  -Gay Ranter
• WOW wtf white people. stfu.
• You can always make an emergency appointment at the counseling cetnter and they'll take you that same day
• @ "There is a special place in hell reserved for people who don’t use eaglebucks or dining dollars when there’s a long line at Eagle’s Nest." What? Why? You do know that only people with meal plans are given Eaglebucks and Dining Dollars, right? Are you saying that anyone without a meal plan (a large majority of upperclassmen) shouldn't go to the Eagle's Nest? Wow, you're pretty ignorant.
• @"Their earliest one was over a week away…are you kidding me?" There is an emergency counseling service for dire situations such as having suicidal thoughts. If anyone is in a situation like that they can tell their RA or Public Safety and can get help outside of normal business hours.
• "Where you're going has no signs 
and you're not going in a straight line
you ought to have me on your mind 
I dare you to think otherwise"
• Where does one find good coffee besides the Dav? I like self serve stuff, but I don't like crap.

• My roommate has strange fetish where he likes to not throw out garbage.
• I wish the girls at AU weren't so God-awfully hideous.
• I wish these frat parties had more guys that cared about my feelings.
• Did anyone else lose all their crap in the big EQB fire Tuesday night?
• Accidentally touched a girl's boob in the library, then got the crap kicked out of me by her jock boyfriend in the middle of the quad.
• TDR didn't have coffee ice cream today, I wish we hadn't outlawed gentleman's duels.
• Pocket watches need to come back
• Actually saw a kid in a pizza cat shirt today.  Whatta hipster.
• Minding my own business in MGC last night when Public Safety threatened to beat me with a pipe.  #fml
• I can't masturbate in SIS because THEY BUILT IT OUT OF WINDOWS????
• I wish they would pump out the library, the basement is still under two feet of water.  #firstworldproblems
• Tried to order something at the Dav yesterday but I ended up staring at the barista's BOOBS for too long, and then I forgot what I wanted to order so I just walked away.
• Found a razor blade in my Subway today, what the H*LL??

• I GOT SWITCHED TO TIMELINE
• Hate it when I go to TDR and ALL THE TABLES ARE MISSING.  What am I supposed to do, sit on the ground like a Buddha?
• Nobody wants to dress up as the Avengers for Halloween for me?
• Why is there blood ALL OVER the front of Ward?
• Uhhhh since when can't we smoke in the Mudbox?

• Found a finger in my tenders.  No, wait.  That is my tender. 
• Every time I'm in Dissident Media, I have to sit in the auditorium and watch these THREE F***ING HIPSTERS in front of me read Pitchfork!
• @"Nietzsche would like to have a word with you nihilists, but he’s dead so it doesn’t matter." Actually, Mark Twain made the quote. And it was to imply that value is subjective, not nihilistic.
• @ Kerwin's house is actually off campus. he does NOT live in that house on Northside. also his house has a waterfall in the backyard 
• @There is a special place in hell: some of us are seniors/grad students who do not have meal plans and do not want to waste money on eaglebucks we never use. check yourself.
• @ So I had something really life shattering... The counseling center is severely overworked, I had a similar experience and I had to wait over a week for my intake and then another 10 days for my first appointment after that. If someone is about to kill themselves or feels like they need help right away they ALWAYS have an emergency counselor on call and you don't have to wait. 
• "THE THIRD WORLD CANT DEVELOP WITHOUT CARBON" ... life cant develop without carbon #scienceatAU
• "Your search for "music piracy" AND "slut shaming" found 0 results." Wut?
• "Your search for "music piracy" AND "slut shaming" found 0 results."  I call BS.
• Step 1: declare an SIS major with a Peace and Conflict Resolution
Step 2: Go abroad to Africa
Step 3: Gather up all the little African children you can. The more the better.
Step 4: Take a picture of you and your little African children. Post to Facebook.
Step 5: Get 30 people to 'like' your picture. Smile, and go home knowing you've done your job, helped Africa, and are now morally superior to everyone else at this school.

• I'm starting to hate myself again.
• I just farted & sneezed in the library.  
• Anyone else been gaining weight since they've been here?  All that jungle juice and steak & egg is adding up...
• Abortions for some, miniature American flags for others!
• People in the library: do not look over my shoulder at my computer. It's quite rude, and also hazardous-I may very well be watching or reading homoerotic fanworks. 
Oh, and if you do it anyway, I promise you that I will write homoerotic fiction about you being a laptop voyeur in the AU library. And it shall be posted on Eagle Rants in 100-word increments. So watch yourself. 
• Everybody's leaving for fall break and I'm lonely! It's not even that big a deal-"fall break" is just a normal three day weekend with good marketing.

• to person who made lal knock-off: thank you! everyone go there!!
• I might transfer.  It's not like this is a bad school, but once my sister leaves I literally won't have anyone here.  I don't know why but I just can't seem to make friends.
• In my opinion, Paul Ryan did a great job in the debate! Go Romney 2012!!
• editor, could you enforce the content editing a little more? some of these rants are unnecessarily graphic :/
