When we were asked to write an article about the hijab in honor of World Hijab Day (Feb. 1), we sat and brainstormed possible topics. We came to realize that all of our ideas centered on the assumed oppressive nature of the hijab. Muslim women have a learned instinct to defend it. The words “oppressed, forced and medieval” have been thrown at us. Our immediate response is to reply with “empowered, liberated and it’s my choice.” We realized our discourse surrounding the hijab should not just pertain to its relation to oppression.
Instead, we are choosing to bring to light the problematic way we communicate about the hijab. We feel the need to humanize ourselves and prove our “Americanness” by deliberately working to prove we are more than the hijab. But, we do not ask our peers to share how they can balance both Christianity and their lifestyle. We have come to understand that, when discussing the hijab out of the context of Islam, we have unintentionally politicized it. Globally, the hijab has been politicized and by doing so, it strips the hijab from its spiritual value.  
We as a society need to be educated, but it is not the inherent responsibility for Muslims to educate. In order for there to be a progressive discourse, it is essential for marginalized communities, such as the Muslim community, to have a platform to share their thoughts. However, it should not be contingent on what society wants to hear from them. There should also be a balance of recognizing not one Muslim can speak on behalf of the whole population.
But, while writing this article, we still feel a responsibility to include that we do feel empowered by the hijab. We ask ourselves, who has placed this responsibility and expectation on us? We would argue Western society has placed the expectation, and we feel responsible for representing the Muslim community fairly due to our deep love for it. We partially feel this pressure because the media has not and does not portray a complete image of Muslim women. This leaves us with an important question: can the media represent Muslim women without exploiting and revolving their story around the hijab? 
We hope that this article brings a refreshing perspective on the internal and external conflicts that Muslims in particular, hijab-wearing woman, have when practicing and discussing their religion.
Being a Muslim hijabi woman, we are seen as an ambassador of the Islamic faith. But then again, are we? This is a question we are grappling with ourselves. We are not condemning the Muslim women who decide to share their experiences about the hijab. It’s all up to Muslim community how they interact and discuss the hijab. We just have to remember that it’s perceived relationship to oppression is not the only discussion worth having. We are not here to prove we are not oppressed; we are here to lead normal lives and practice our faith.

A parade during Mardi Gras.
A Mardi Gras celebration will be held at District Wharf on Tuesday, Feb. 13 from 6 - 8 p.m. 
The event will begin with a vibrant parade filled with floats designed by local restaurants and retailers who will march to New Orlean’s style of brass band music. 
Look out for performances by the Washington Nationals Presidents, Washington Redskins Cheerleaders Alumni Association and LED Hula Hooping. Spectators can watch high-flying balloons and traditional bead tossing during the parade. There will be a dance celebration on the District Pier afterwards, followed by a finale of fireworks.
Mardi Gras-themed food will be available from the restaurants and bars in the area including:  Pearl Street Warehouse, Union Stage, The Watering Hole, Kirwan's Irish Pub and Taylor Gourmet. This event is free to the public. 
Junior Emma Hoss, who is from Louisiana, said that the best part of Mardi Gras are the parades. 
“Parades happen for about two months during the carnival season and most parades are family-friendly,” Hoss said. “The floats are insanely well-decorated and local high schools and colleges send bands, dance teams and cheerleading teams to walk in the parades and perform. It's a whole experience filled with live music and people having fun.”  
Although nothing can compare to Mardi Gras in New Orleans, this celebration can offer a taste of the colorful experience. 
“Mardi Gras is all about having fun with friends and family and eating a ton of good food,” Hoss said.
Get ready to celebrate Fat Tuesday with all the green, purple and gold D.C. can offer.
Where: 735 Water St. SW
Metro: Waterfront-SEU station, Green Line

Fire trucks at Nebraska Hall in February 2018. 
Students were evacuated from Nebraska Hall Monday night due to black smoke. No one was injured and the smoke is now under control, D.C. Fire and EMS told The Eagle.
A generator produced the black smoke, Vito Maggiolo, public information officer for D.C. Fire and EMS, said. People saw the smoke and mistook it for a fire, Maggiolo said, but there was no fire. A generator in the rear of the building produced the smoke when it was activated for the first time in a while, he said. 
D.C. Fire and EMS dispatched the call at 7:16 p.m., Maggiolo said. PEPCO was called to the scene.
This story will be updated.
