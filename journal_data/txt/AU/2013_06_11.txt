Fifty years ago, President John F. Kennedy shifted his administration's policy toward peace as he delivered his commencement speech to AU's graduating class of 1963.
Kennedy gave his "Strategy of Peace" address on June 10, 1963 while the United States was in the midst of a stalemate with the Soviet Union and close to war with Cuba.
During his speech, Kennedy called for a test ban treaty, where he promised the United States would stop nuclear testing if other countries did the same.
At the commencement ceremony, Kennedy received a doctorate of civil laws, the University's highest honorary degree, The Eagle previously reported.
Kennedy was assassinated Nov. 22, 1963, about five months after his speech at AU.
