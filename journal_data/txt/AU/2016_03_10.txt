Passion, adventure and inspiration: these words describe the life of an AU alumnus, Michael Reese.
In his recent documentary, Reese takes viewers back to his life as a college student and graduate. He lived a simple life, one that would connect with audience members following a traditional career trajectory and working towards happiness. Reese attended UNC Chapel Hill and completed his BA in economics. He then graduated from AU’s Washington College of Law in May 2002 and Kogod School of Business in December 2002. Reese worked as an attorney for a number of years and lived the 9-5 office job life. He was going to work until retirement and start a family with a significant other, just like any other person.
But Reese knew he needed to do something different. He wanted to be happy. And he wanted to live a meaningful life. 
After paying thousands of dollars of student debt, Reese had the chance to live his life the way he wanted to. He quit his job and did something most people would never consider: he traveled the world. 
“I didn’t want to look back at my life when I’m old and grey and realize it was too late,” Reese admitted. “I wanted to live my life the way I wanted to now.”
Reese’s personal journey culminated in his documentary , spanning 18 months across all seven continents. Reese bring viewers along as he experiences the exotic jungles of Mexico City and Costa Rica, the frigid deserts of Antarctica, the city of Peru, adventures in Europe, complications of the Middle East and a romance in Asia. The film allows people to travel the world through the eyes of Reese and embark on his adventures through the photos and videoclips masterfully assembled by the AU alum. 
But Reese explains that traveling is about more than just pictures. It’s about really understanding the history of where you are going and the culture of the people that you meet. A person can experience a lot of wisdom and knowledge through the journey.
Reese’s documentary allows viewers to the ask important questions. “If you could look back at your life, would you regret it? If you were given a second chance, what would you do differently” His advice to AU Eagles and other college students is to “not be afraid to live the life you want. Never live life a certain way because you think that’s how others are living it.”
“I Fear Regret: A Personal Transformation” is available on Reese’s website and can be rented for $1.49, expiring 72 hours after the purchase. Reese’s documentary may provide extra inspiration for International Relations students who want to live an adventurous life like Reese or just have a passion in different parts of the world. 
As college students who want to graduate,  go to grad school, find a job and work until they retire, Reese’s film stresses the importance of expanding interests and finding meaningful adventures. 
Don’t live a regretful life. Go out and experience the world in a new way.
