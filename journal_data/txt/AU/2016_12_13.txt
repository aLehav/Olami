It has never been easy to be a woman.  As I wandered through a dimly lit parking lot on Nov. 30 on my way to to see sophomore director Emma Hooks’ production of “The Changeling,” I was struck with how vulnerable my gender has made me. The list of things I cannot do is far longer than the list of things that I can.  After all, I am only a woman and woman was not formed on her own; rather, she comes from Adam’s rib.  For these reasons, “The Changeling” -- and its ability to question gender and the rigidity of religion that frequently binds women in its clutches -- resonated deeply with me.  
This year, the AU Rude Mechanicals have a strong leader in its executive director, junior Elizabeth Morton, and its artistic director, junior Perry Scalfano.  I remain impressed and humbled by the Rudes’ ability to create immersive, thought-provoking and emotional experiences.  In the past, I have never been a fan of William Shakespeare or his contemporaries, but seeing so many of the Rudes’ performances have led me to a change of heart. 
Hook’s “Changeling” is a contemporary adaption of a Jacobean era play written by Thomas Middleton and William Rowley. Set in religious modern day Spain, Beatrice-Joanna (freshman Sabrina Koss) is betrothed to Alonzo (freshman Jake Andrejat).  However, Beatrice-Joanna is secretly in love with Alsemero (freshman Lukas Lehmann) and hopes to marry him, despite what her father, Vermandero, (junior Ryan Guerra), has arranged.  
In order to secure her marriage to Alsemero, Beatrice-Joanna hires her father’s servant DeFlores (freshman Shae McDonald) to kill Alonzo.  Because DeFlores is in love with Beatrice-Joanna, DeFlores obliges.  Due to Alonzo’s death, Beatrice-Joanna is able to marry Alsemero.  However, Alonzo’s sister, Tomaza (freshman Victoria Aumack), remains suspicious of Vermandero’s household.  Roping her maid into the plot (freshman Maggie Shircliff), Beatrice-Joanna struggles to hide the truth and her growing love for DeFlores.
With several storylines compacted into one act, “The Changeling” moves at a brisk and engaging pace.  Hooks’ direction is concise, with minimal set pieces and scene changes.  Her selection of actors is superb.  I found myself so immersed in the performance that I did not realize that the fifty minutes of its runtime had passed when the final bows were taken.  
Additionally, praise goes to production manager, senior Rebecca Silva, lighting design assistant, freshman Jamie Gottlieb and sound designer, senior Callie Trawick.  Together, their expert management of elaborate lighting and music enhanced the mood of suspense and tension.
Throughout the performance, religion remains a constant.  Whether signified in action, such as prayer, or by the crucifix that Beatrice-Joanna wears around her neck, the weight of religion is present.  The sin of murder seems inconsequential when it is compared to the sin of forbidden, same-sex love.  
It is refreshing to see a character struggle with her sexuality as Koss so brilliantly portrays.  For Beatrice-Joanna, loving both men and women is something that conflicts with the mere nature of her being and community.  McDonald’s portrayal as the tortured DeFlore is often stilted and stone faced in comparison to Koss.  
However, McDonald’s final moments onstage are superb. The tempered emotions that explode at the end of the play are a cumulation of frustration, rage and, most surprisingly, love.  DeFlores, however unhinged she may be, knows that this is not a world in which she and Beatrice-Joanna can love each other. 
In many ways, “The Changeling” is reminiscent of a film noir.  Men like Alonzo, Alsemero and Vermandero are oblivious chumps while women like Beatrice-Joanna, DeFlores and Tomaza plot and scheme.  At one point, Beatrice-Joanna tells DeFlores, “Would creation had formed me man . . . oh ‘tis the soul of freedom!”  The anguish and conflict in Koss’ performance shows Beatrice-Joanna’s struggle to accept her gender and the reality that it brings: to be a woman is to be caged, to have decisions made for her by men.  
It is only with acts of violence that Beatrice-Joanna is able to find liberation from the men who dictate who she should be.  Ironically, it is those acts of violence which propel Tomaza into a role of vengeance, strength and individuality as she seeks to find her brother’s killer.  She is the strongest woman on the stage and, in her fiery performance, Aumack shows that Tomaza knows the power within herself.  
Being a woman is often messy and frustrating, but Hooks’ direction, her actors’ performances and her team of assistant director, sophomore Emma Hoss, and stage manager, freshman Quinn Anderson, harness the control, authority, energy and depth in every woman.  I am better off for having seen “The Changeling” and now more than ever, I am grateful and proud to be a woman, despite the obstacles in my way.

We have entered a time period of extreme polarization. While we do not have X-wings, Imperial shuttles or droids, our means of fighting have taken root in other forms of reaction and opposition. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story knows its place in the current political climate and is self aware enough to create a narrative that challenges the binary of simply good versus evil. It’s a lesson that resonates with me and will likely resonate with any viewer who has bore the heavy weight of the past year on their shoulders.
Rogue One is a standalone film in the Star Wars canon. Nestled between the events in Revenge of the Sith, released in 2005, and A New Hope, the fourth film released in 1977, it tells the story of the beginnings of the Rebellion. Early in the film, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is separated from her father, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen), an Imperial engineer. As with many of the Star Wars films before it, Rogue One heavily explores the themes of family and unconditional love in the face of morally mixed actions. Jyn herself is marred by her father’s past and his connection to authoritarian rule. She is not Princess Leia, fighting the good fight; instead, Jyn is motivated by her love for her father over any politics.  
Many have attempted to make comparisons between Jyn and Rey, the heroine of the recent The Force Awakens. While both characters are strong, brave women, Jyn’s character harnesses the complexity of the shifting climate in a more nuanced way. It has been no more than 20 years after Darth Vader’s rise to power and the death of the Jedi Council and, in many ways, the choice presented to the Rebel Alliance is often between giving up by fading into the background or joining the fight with the risk of dying. Rogue One, therefore, is a grittier representation of the galaxy far, far away. It is full of uncertainty and its characters often find a crisis of faith when it comes to challenging their own intentions.
At one point in the film, Rebel spy Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) tells Jyn he has been part of the Rebellion since age six. Born into the fight, much of his loyalty is found in the fight’s familiarity and its community. When Cassian is given the missions he must complete, he knows that his success is only a small part of a larger plan. As the film goes on, he begins to question the ethics and morality behind the orders he must follow and his own reasons for his fight.  
Additionally, Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed), a former Imperial pilot, seeks redemption and absolution as he works with the Rebels, delivering an important message smuggled from an unlikely hero in the Empire to radical Rebel Saw Gerrara (Forest Whitaker). The themes of redemption flow heavily throughout the film, as several characters struggle between resisting from within the system or risking their lives and those of the ones they love by entering the full resistance movement. Fundamentally, the film asks us to realize the value of both positions and the emotions and complexities within such a difficult choice. 
For what Rogue One is, it is good. Director Gareth Edwards has taken a huge risk in creating a film that merges both the past and present of the Star Wars universe. There is no doubt that some diehard fans and traditionalists may be skeptical, yet Rogue One shines in originality compared to The Force Awakens. It breathes with a uniqueness that The Force Awakens could not find. Instead of relying on that which is tried and true, Edwards shows that the battles we face are not linear and they are not able to be placed in perfect boxes. Furthermore, Rogue One features a diverse cast. Seeing so many new faces, especially people of color, shows that Star Wars is evolving for a new generation of viewers and few things make me more excited than that. 
As I walked out of the theatre, I was moved by Rogue One and its relevance to my own life and the unrest in our world. Now more than ever, it is important that we, too, contemplate the fact that we are more than our movements. We are more than our own righteous struggle. Do our ends justify our means? Perhaps so, but that is not for us to decide.  
“Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” opens in movie theaters on Dec. 16, 2016.
