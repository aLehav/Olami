American University ranks as the university with the most politically active students, according to Princeton Review’s yearly rankings.  
Princeton Review, a college admission services company, ranked the university as No. 1 in the category, based on student ratings of their own levels of political awareness, according to the organization’s website. Last year, AU ranked as No. 4 in the category, Washingtonian reports.
AU also ranked in other categories of the review, including “Most Active Student Government,” “Nobody Plays Intramural Sports,” “Financial Aid Not So Great” and “College City Gets High Marks.”
For more than a decade, George Washington University ranked on the most politically active list, ranking as No.1 for four consecutive years, according to the GW Hatchet. But this year, the school dropped off the list.
Campus political organizations, including AU College Democrats and Student Government, shared their excitement with the Eagle on the new title. 
“Like most students, we're extremely proud of AU being ranked the #1 politically active school,” AU College Democrats said in a statement. “With [the] 2018 Midterms around the corner, we can't wait to get started to tap into all the political excitement on campus and get students engaged with campaigns across the country through our phone banking and canvassing efforts.”
Alex Behle, the current student government secretary, told The Eagle he wasn’t surprised the University ranked high for politically active students. 
“AU students are setting an example for how to not only engage locally, but to effectively advocate for issues facing communities across the globe,” Behle said. “This ranking affirms what every AU student already knows—our campus is leading the nation in creating purposeful change. We’re proud to see AU stand among the most elite universities in the nation.”
