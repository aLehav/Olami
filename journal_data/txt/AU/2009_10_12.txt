When comedian Tina Fey and writer-producer Robert Carlock decided to develop a television show, they ended up striking comedic gold.
This is not surprising, considering both Fey and Carlock’s backgrounds in “Saturday Night Live.” The treasure in question became “30 Rock,” an NBC sitcom named after the building it is produced in, 30 Rockefeller Plaza. With a whopping 22 Emmy nominations, as well as Golden Globe and SAG awards, “30 Rock” is a bona fide hit, entertaining audiences of all ages. 
The show centers around Liz Lemon (Fey), head writer of a sketch comedy show called “TGS with Tracy Jordan” (Tracy Morgan). Everyday is something new for Lemon, whether it be dealing with her right-wing boss, Jack Donaghy (played by Alec Baldwin), or enduring the peppy page, Kenneth (played by Jack McBrayer). Life in show business is fast-paced, and audiences watch while Lemon tries to keep her personal life intact and her professional life successful. 
“There’s actually very little improv on the show, because the writers are so good at what they do,” actor Jack McBrayer said in an interview with The Eagle. “Even if you have no comedic timing, these guys will make you look good.” 
“And we do!” Carlock chimed in. 
For those who watch the show and wonder if Jack McBrayer is anything like the loveable Kenneth, dispel your worries. He is — right down to the authentic Southern accent. 
“I’m really similar to him,” McBrayer said. “We’re both people-pleasers, we both want to do well at our job. I guess the hardest part though is being so extremely peppy at the crazy filming hours! I have to have a lot of caffeine to be that peppy. Sometimes, I’m just like, ‘Wow, daddy needs a nap!’”
As a result of the show’s success, McBrayer has become something of a hero to actual NBC pages. 
“I’m not gonna lie, I do get some special attention at the Rockefeller Center,” McBrayer said. “One of the pages even showed me that in their handbook, there’s a section called ‘Tips from Kenneth.’”
For Carlock, “30 Rock” also reflects a lot of his own life. 
“In a way, I’m definitely similar to Liz Lemon,” Carlock said. “I’ve done the writing thing for ‘SNL’ and ‘Friends,’ so I know what it’s like. The shows are so different, but ‘Friends’ really helped prepare me for this show.”
Unfortunately, though, the writing experience as shown on “30 Rock” is nothing like the process in real life. 
“I mean, we spend so many hours with these people, writing,” Carlock said. “We always try to incorporate the actor’s personal qualities into their character. Sometimes though, we do get distracted. One time, someone found these like punching pad things and some Star Wars marbles ... they made up this game where you had to hit the marbles or something, I think we called it ‘Paddly Marblies.”
With the long television filming process, different things fuel the players of “30 Rock” for their strenuous days.
“Diet Mountain Dew and a bowl of cereal,” McBrayer said cheerfully. “Then you can throw in a little bran, and it fills you up.”
Both McBrayer and Carlock are excited about the upcoming season of “30 Rock” and what audiences can expect. 
“Kenneth is just up to his usual hi-jinks, but there’s going to be an episode where Liz Lemon and Donaghy go to Kenneth’s hometown, where pretty much everyone is like him,” McBrayer said. “That should be a funny one.”
Carlock also thought fans had especially funny shows to look forward to.
“We have this great upcoming Halloween episode,” Carlock said. “Tracy Jordan starts to get really paranoid that he’s gonna die and so he freaks out and sees who he can get to die, before himself ... Oh, Halloween is a magical night for drunk girls in strange costumes.”
Four seasons in, “30 Rock” has proven itself a comedy favorite. With kooky characters and hilarious dialogue, it is as relatable as it is entertaining. If you haven’t checked it out yet, just let the awards speak for themselves. “30 Rock” is infectious and will have you wishing you had these characters in your own life.

Critics and fans alike have found it hard to group singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile into a single genre. She’s been described as rock, folk, alternative and even country. After watching her perform at the 9:30 club Wednesday night, it’s easy to see why Carlile cannot be contained to one set of rules.
Musician Katie Herzig opened the show with a short set of songs from her albums “Weightless” and “Apple Tree.” Herzig’s music falls under the mellow-but-still-slightly-techno category that has recently taken over the television airwaves on shows like “Smallville” and “Grey’s Anatomy” — programs in which her own music has been featured.  
With a voice part-Jewel and part-Anya Marina, Herzig’s breathy delivery was unique but enjoyable, especially on the more rock-heavy “Hologram,” a song she introduced as her angry break-up tune. The eclectic mix of sounds in her set, with instruments ranging from clarinet to accordion, proved Herzig is entertaining and talented, but one could tell the crowd was waiting for the real star of the show to begin.
The crowd went crazy with applause once Carlile took the stage. Without wasting a minute, Carlile and her band delved into an a cappella version of “Oh Dear,” from her newest album “Give Up the Ghost.” The five-part harmony was impeccable and proved from the beginning that Carlile’s voice is one to be reckoned with. This was not the only time Carlile sang sans technology in the show, as later in her set her band performed an unplugged version of “Dying Day.” 
Despite the naturally raspy tone of her voice, Carlile has the range and delivery of a seasoned professional. Satisfying her fans of varying time lengths, Carlile sang songs from all three of her studio albums, making sure to play hits like “Happy” and “What Can I Say” from her first self-titled debut, as well as her newest single, “Dreams,” and various tunes from her latest CD, released the day before the D.C. concert.
The emotion evident in Carlile’s voice is perhaps the biggest attraction for fans. Before playing the next likely single off “Give Up the Ghost,” “That Year,” Carlile explained that she wrote the song about a friend who had committed suicide when they were both 16 years old, and how she wasn’t even able to speak his name for 10 years before one day waking up and just writing the song. Carlile looked near tears as she played the acoustic solo piece, and as she ended, one could hear sniffs in the audience as people wiped away tears.
Big on audience participation, Carlile played to the crowd, often standing on the very edge of the stage and playing directly above all the fans singing along. She also kept a bevy of monogrammed guitar picks stuck to her microphone stand that she used and then tossed out into the audience after each song. During “Turpentine,” an audience favorite from her second album “The Story,” Carlile stopped the song to teach the audience a three-part harmony for the chorus that temporarily turned the sea of screaming fans into a D.C. choir of sorts.
Though Carlile’s own songs have been racing up the charts (her newest release hit was number one on the iTunes chart for a few days this week before slipping down to third position), her encore was full of covers of other artists’ songs. A rousing rendition of Johnny Cash’s “Ring of Fire” elicited an amazing guitar solo from Carlile’s guitarist Tim Hanseroth. Carlile then sat at the piano for an emotional version of The Beatles’ “Let It Be,” before finally launching into three of her own songs, ending the show with parent-dedicated “Pride and Joy.” 
As evidenced by the line wrapping around the block of the 9:30 club to have Carlile sign autographs after the show, one could easily tell that her music truly strikes the heart of fans and her dedication to them is evident. Staying outside for over an hour after the show signing records, picks, ticket stubs and the like, Carlile proved that much like her fans that night, she has staying power.

French turntablist Wax Tailor’s tour in support of his recently released third album, “In The Mood For Life,” made its stop at DC9 on Thursday, Oct. 8. Wax Tailor’s name is very apropos: his unique blend of trip-hop, hip-hop, downtempo, clever movie samples, jazz and soul has garnered him many accolades, with his 1995 album “Tales Of The Forgotten Melodies” becoming one of the best-selling electronic releases of the year. 
Wax Tailor’s new album perfectly showcases how natural and symbiotic the blend between hip-hop and downtempo can be. Since the release of DJ Shadow’s seminal album “Endtroducing,” many musicians such as DJ Krush, RJD2 (whom Wax Tailor previously toured with), DJ Vadim and others have shown that turntablism by its very definition is a genre-defying art form. 
Wax Tailor has always had a consummate ability to build sonic blends — an ability that comes from having feet firmly planted in both the DJ-centric hip-hop culture and the beat-and-atmospherics world of trip-hop. 
Astronautalis opened the show with an interesting shoegazer, rock-talking, blues-punk, hip-hop-Beck-esque hodgepodge. The set-up of electric cello and flutes on the stage signaled Wax Tailor’s natural musical evolution on this tour. 
“I would say this album is a lot more organic; I have been working with a lot of orchestral stuff lately,” Wax Tailor explained to the audience. 
A constant element throughout the entire performance was Wax Tailor’s live turntablism — he could have very easily relied on laptop wizardry but he worked the wax with the seasoned knowledge of a pro. Yet, he did not take center stage or allow the scratching to overtake the performance. In a subtle way, he used the turntables and vocal samples to work with the other musicians. Songs flowed together seamlessly creating a sonic landscape, and the entire set felt thoroughly uncontrived and flowed together perfectly, incorporating both the free-style format of hip-hop and the improvisational component of live music. 
The set list consisted of material mostly from his new album, and with 19 tracks on the new release, there was plenty to mine from. Chanteuse Charlotte Savary’s performance was especially spectacular — in the pantheon of female voices in downtempo music, from Beth Gibbons with Portishead to Martina Topley Bird with Tricky and Emiliana Torrini and Lulu with Thievery Corporation, she more than held her own. Her lilting, beautiful voice lent itself perfectly to the atmospheric instrumentals. Her first song “Dragon Chasers” is sure to be one of the hits from “In The Mood For Life” with its melancholy vocal loop chorus and languid flow. 
Rapper Mattic followed with a crowd-stirring performance of “Until Heaven Stops The Rain” and free styled effortlessly with the band and the turntables. Cellist Matthieu Detton and flutist Ludivine Issambourg’s performance was absolutely phenomenal — very unlike a typical set-up where these instruments support and weave in and out; they were an integral component of all the songs. 
The flutist improvised and took center stage on many of the tracks, with this call-and-response pattern lending itself perfectly to the improvisation style of both hip-hop and turntablism. On “Fireflies,” when both Charlotte and Mattic took the stage, the seamless way in which all five musicians worked with and off each other showcased the sheer musical breadth and genre blending that is a hallmark of Wax Tailor’s work. 
Toward the end of the show, Mattic offered a raucous take on “B Boys On Wax,” a truly appropriate homage to the MCing and turntablism culture that Wax Tailor clearly knows and contributes to. The band then performed two songs off “Tales Of The Forgotten Melodies” — “Que Sera” and the DJ Krush-esque “Out Dance.” The final song was the up-tempo new single “Say Yes.”
Wax Tailor has always shown a consummate ability to craft sonic landscapes, but what makes him unique is that, while he is an excellent turntablist, he never makes his work solely about that. While this new album incorporates more live instrumentation, it also doesn’t do so jarringly or take his style in an entirely new direction. “In The Mood For Life,” as its title suggests, is very much about a natural and subtle integration of the turntables and the instruments, the songs and the atmospherics, the slow and the fast, the melancholy and the upbeat.

In today’s music scene, it is rare to see a band made up of less than five members and each guitar playing a lackluster simplified pop-rock melody. Lights Resolve eats bands like that for breakfast.
This three-piece group from Lawrence, N.Y., are proving that less is more and, if done right, just one guitar along with bass and drums can have just as much power as a five-piece. Lights Resolve came out to the D.C. area Wednesday, Oct. 7, playing Jammin’ Java in Vienna, Va., to rock the house along with We Shot the Moon and Destry. 
Although these New Yorkers are playing at much smaller venues this tour, they are no stranger to huge arena venues, opening up for bands like Dashboard Confessional, The Used and Straylight Run, even selling out the famed Bowery Ballroom in New York City as headliners. But now, after months of writing and recording for an upcoming release (yet to be determined), the guys came out to the Jammin’ Java knowing quite well that their name was not known and that they had to win the crowd over with their stage presence and passion. 
Guitarist and vocalist Matt Reich said he had no problem going from playing for huge bands in arenas to shows where only 20 people show up.
“Our sound works best in arenas where it travels so far from three small guys so that is amazing, and playing small venues where no-one knows is tough,” Reich said in an interview with The Eagle. “But in both situations it’s great because it makes us work harder to win over new fans and it pays off like it did in August at the Bowery, which was a dream come true. This band is all about the uphill battle.” 
Although this night in Vienna lacked the screaming fans that the other arenas had, Lights Resolve still managed to steal the show, opening with a song from their 2008 EP “Currency” called “The Hills and Michael Jackson,” while showcasing each of their abilities on their respective instruments right from the start.  
Next up was “With the Pieces,” a new song still in the perfecting stages. The piece shows clear comparisons to a band that the three all look up to, Muse, who they all recently saw on tour alongside U2.
“It was probably one of the most inspiring shows we have ever seen,”   drummer Neal Saini said. “We all aspire to someday reach a level of performance that they have... [and] hope to take a piece of what we saw and learned that night and make it our own and deliver it to our fans.”  
The trio has been together since late 2005, after a previous band they were in fell apart. Luke Daniels came in to replace their former bassist over a year ago and has proven that he can roll with the other two, especially with his delicious bass line groove in the song “Hurt a Little.” While none of the guys had experience being a lead vocalist before, as auditioning for a lead singer went on, they realized that one of their own had the power to do it all along.
“It turned out that none of the singers [we auditioned] could sing the parts as well as I could, even though I didn’t know exactly ‘how’ to sing,” Reich said. “But we decided to give it a stab and I started taking vocal lessons and it happened naturally — at the lucky age of 23.”  
Lights Resolve has never been a band that you could quite fit in any one category and the band members know this.
“Actually I think we’ve finally come up with a genre that fits us: alt-rock/nu-gaze/pop n’ roll,” Reich said.
Nu-gaze, as explained by the group, is a spinoff of shoe-gazing, a genre of the ‘90s during which bands would stare at their pedal boards the entire time playing with a plethora of effects and are extremely sound driven.
“We try to tap dance as much as possible on stage,” Reich noted. 
What sets them apart the most,  however, is the fact that they are a band of three.
“It would be great to have a little extra help at times, but it’s a huge part of what makes us unique, “Reich said. “We’ve figured out how to balance our sound — we make sure that our parts don’t blend in together, yet that it still balances out well. What you hear is what you get.”
This can be seen in their new single, “Dreaming of Love,” a song that will be featured in the new installment of the popular video game “Rock Band.”
Lights Resolve is not affiliated with any record label yet, but they don’t view that as a bad thing.
“We know bands that owe hundreds of thousands of dollars to labels and are lesser-known than we are,” Daniels said. “That doesn’t mean we aren’t in debt — I’ve only been in this band for a year and I’ve spent thousands already — but we owe that to ourselves, not a label looking out for themselves and not our music.” 
For the past three years, they’ve done everything on their own, making their two EPs and promoting and spending every moment they can with their fans.
“It’s great getting to know the people that come to our shows,” Reich said. “They are the reason we are able to do this.”  
This trio is not afraid to put themselves out there as a band and as people and their set was full of passion and interaction with the crowd, according to Reich.
“A long time ago we decided that in this band we were gonna play our hearts out, tour our asses off, and make the best music we could possible make, and be in an environment where the three of us are happy,” he said.

 Paranormal
Grade: A - 
“Paranormal Activity” is a movie that truly lingers in the mind after you finish watching it and haunts you after you leave the movie theater. Unlike most contemporary horror flicks, it taps into something deeper and more powerful. 
The film chronicles several days in the life of Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat). After the young couple moves into a typical suburban “tract” house, they become increasingly disturbed by an unknown presence. Katie keeps hearing thumps in the walls. Micah, the skeptical boyfriend, decides to document any peculiarities by setting up a camera in their bedroom at night. The camera often rolls during the day, too, as Micah and Katie, with the help of a hilariously terrified psychic, struggle with the effects of the increasingly freaky haunting. 
Katie reveals to Micah that she’s experienced such events sporadically throughout her life. Micah makes several attempts at communicating with what the psychic calls a “demon.” At times, he playfully quarrels and jokes about this so-called demon with Katie. However, when Micah’s recordings show increasingly spooky material, the joke ends up being intensely serious.
Following the likes of “The Blair Witch Project” and “Cloverfield,” “Paranormal Activity” is shot using a handheld camera. Though it reverts back to the once novel, subjective camera horror, it surpasses it in its effectiveness. It is also a lot scarier. The shot of the bedroom at night skips ahead in time-lapse form until weird occurrences emerge. While some nights are ordinary, the banality of the couple’s day-to-day existence when they’re not hearing anything enhances the realism of the movie. Although this may make some impatient, it provides the necessary tension.
Ultimately powerless, the couple ends up experiencing supernatural forces that leave one squirming in their seat. Unlike “The Blair Witch Project,” “Paranormal Activity” shows what is going on between the characters and antagonizing entity. The images and sounds don’t relinquish from your mind as quickly as the apparition itself, and it all looks believable. It makes you think twice about the plausibility of the situation and wonder what happens when you go to sleep yourself. 
In the vein of Hitchcock, director Oren Peli achieves a lot with little. The film only focuses on the inside of the house. Costing only $15,000, the ultra-low-budget horror film is reminiscent of atmospheric pieces like “The Shining.” 
The setting plays a large part in the audience’s discomfort; the ways in which the house is established leaves you no air to breathe. The low-budget aesthetic, though small, produces brilliant, heightened effects which end up helping the filmmaker execute a rope-balancing act with the audience’s emotions and expectations — and it works.   
This is a no gag-inducing gore flick. If you are in the mood for a horror movie that is scary, entertaining and actually realistic, this is the movie for you.

If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then the cover song is the greatest homage that one artist can pay to another — or, at least, for the most part. Sometimes it’s an audacious move, as the cover artist is assuming that they even have enough credibility to be re-creating the work of the first.
Other times, the second act is a show-stealer; the cover is so great that listeners forget there was ever an original. Maybe it’s even good-natured mockery, an obscure indie artist covering chart-topping pop hits with his acoustic guitar, or more recently his ukelele. At any rate, the cover song is an art form and the perfect method of musical recycling, it keeps old tracks fresh.
The most successful and widely received cover songs are those that re-interpret and re-invent the original songs. No one needs a millionth cover of “Wonderwall.” We all know what it sounds like. Most interesting are songs like ska band Save Ferris’ rendition on the ‘80s pop-rock-Celtic hit “Come on Eileen” or the Watson Twins’ country-folk take on The Cure’s “Just Like Heaven.”
Indie artists love cover songs. This is because indie artists love irony. From Ben Gibbard’s rendition of Avril Lavigne’s “Complicated” to Jenny Owen Youngs covering Nelly’s “Hot in Herre” and Tegan and Sara’s cover of “Umbrella,” it has become quite evident that there’s no bigger crowd pleaser than an indie favorite taking an acoustic guitar to a genre where it doesn’t belong.
More than that, cover songs have become venues for calling original artists out on their own absurdity — it’s a form of commentary. In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs made their name known to the world with “Maps.” In 2004, American Idol Kelly Clarkson topped the charts with her hit “Since U Been Gone.” In 2005, singer/songwriter Ted Leo realized both songs had the same guitar solo. Introducing his song as a cover of Clarkson’s hit, Leo picked up with “Maps” on the other side of his guitar solo, leaving audiences with the realization, “Oh, that’s why that sounds familiar.”
Indie artists also love to cover each other, since indie artists are kind of pretentious and tend to believe they can do other people’s jobs just as well as they do, though this is rarely true. Such is the case with “Maps.” Although the song is composed of little more than a simple guitar line and a thunderous drum beat, no one — not even the Arcade Fire, not even the White Stripes — have been able to capture frontwoman Karen O’s quiet, haunting vocals or mimic the way she pleads, “Wait, they don’t love you like I love you.” Sometimes the essence of a song lies in the singer.
The White Stripes have had something of an unsuccessful record with cover songs. Besides “Maps,” Jack and Meg White also did Canadian twins Tegan and Sara the favor of putting them on the mainstream map with the cover of their song “Walking With A Ghost.” The vocals were far above White’s range, and the Stripes’ rock and roll sound meshed poorly with Tegan and Sara’s catchy indie-folk pop, but this was an instance in which quality songwriting prevailed. The simplicity of Tegan and Sara’s words combined with a catchy melody shined through the Stripes’ cover and propelled the twins into the public eye.
And in this way, cover songs may be less imitation and more a portal to mainstream success. Entire albums, like the “Punk Goes Crunk” series, in which punk bands such as New Found Glory and Say Anything cover classic hip-hop tracks, have been devoted to cover songs, and artists have made entire careers of it.
Lounge singer Richard Cheese earned his fame through re-creating kitschy, swing-band style covers of popular rock, rap, heavy metal and pop songs. Even his band, Lounge Against the Machine, is a parody of popular culture. Me First and the Gimme Gimmes are another band who, since 1995, have made their living off of punk covers of classics, perhaps most notably “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” which has been used as the theme song for HBO’s “Taxicab Confessions.”
Segue to fame or lazy musicianship? It may not even matter, since the best covers inject their own dose of originality. More and more, musicians are straying from the tendency to cover a song note by note and taking covers as opportunities to showcase what they can do with an already existing work.

 MADRID, SPAIN 
Having grown up in a family filled with strong, loud and a tad overbearing Jewish women, I had automatically assumed no other culture in the world could touch the super-human force of nature and intimidation that is the Jewish mother. That was, however, until I met my señora, or host mother.
Don’t let her 4-foot-11-inch frame fool you. She’s a Galician beast. When she talks, the walls shake a little, the dog instantly quiets down and all other natural sound in the world is drowned out — you had better listen.
Her unquestionable dominance is most felt in the kitchen. When my señora cooks, she cooks for an army. Drawers in the fridge are filled with what has to be five dozen eggs stacked high. In the pantry, crates are overflowing with tomatoes, green peppers and apples, and milk cartons are bought by the half dozen. I came home from class last night and told her I wasn’t hungry. She told me to give her five minutes, and I was greeted with a giant four-course feast as she settled down into the chair across from mine at the dinner table. That’s the regular day-to-day mind game with my señora — rule number one: you are expected to eat every ounce of food on the plate (or else she takes it as a personal insult); rule number two: every day that plate grows; rule number three: the first two rules only apply to you, the eater. She never actually eats any of her food herself.
“Eat more,” she insists. “You don’t have enough meat on your bones.”
Needless to say, I haven’t won a single match.
She fixes my already-made bed, insists on ironing my underwear. During a night out with my friends after class, I received an angry phone call from my señora scolding me for not telling her I would be home late.
After my first week at my homestay, I was annoyed at all of the nudging. One mother is more than enough. I didn’t want to feel like I was in high school once again. Nevertheless, my attitude dramatically changed one night after I came home from a long day filled with unapologetic professors, a fight with a close friend and a walk home in the rain. I looked like a wet poodle and felt even worse. When I walked through the door, my señora gave me two big, wet kisses on the cheek, a big bowl of lentil soup and a cup of tea, no questions asked — exactly what I needed.
While I don’t have as much freedom as I did at AU, I realize how lucky I am to have someone who cares about my well-being while living in such a strange, new place. It also doesn’t hurt knowing you have a delicious hot meal and a warm, loving house waiting for you after a stressful day of classes.
So nowadays, even if I’m not hungry, I eat my “light dinner” of bread and omelet and soup and pasta and 12-inch-high veggie plate without a fight.
It’s comforting to know my mother has found some resourceful way to watch over me while abroad.

Adams Morgan is not just the home of numerous hookah bars, late-night food spots and that one rude bouncer who took your fake ID last year (curse you, underwater-themed bar!). On Saturday, Oct. 3, it housed the Crafty Bastards “alternative” craft fair — an interesting event, to say the least.
Though craft fairs might seem like a great idea in an economic downturn — “We’re gonna get some cool stuff! For cheap!” — thriftiness turned out not to be the name of the game at this particular extravaganza, but variety.
As the event’s Web site proudly proclaimed, there were indeed 150-plus vendors spanning at least three large parking lots. The uniform-white tents stretched further than the eye could see. Many of the booths had pretty cool stuff, regardless of extravagant prices.
You could find all manner of ironic artwork (lots of old-time themes, animals in top hats, etc.), a thousand pairs of stereotypical homemade earrings (made from keyboard keys, bottle caps, beads and the like) and booths too numerous to mention that elicited the response, “I could make that myself.” 
There were also many things you might want to own, but likely laid outside the price range of the average college student. A vintage cardigan with screen-printed scissors on it ran $150, while a few journals with cool covers from old books went for $35.  It’s not that you didn’t want to own everything at Crafty Bastards, it’s just that the average person would probably feel guilty buying anything. To sum it up: all was cute, but unnecessary. 
Most people seemed to buy something little, like a wolf charm, a little piece of art, or a button. There were also a few free activities throughout the day — hula-hoop lessons, pin making, needlepoint — so if you had some time to spare, there was some crafting of your own to do. 
Despite the fact that most either left with empty hands or an empty wallet, the event provided a nice excuse to wander around in the sun, even if the fair was a little crowded; you can’t really go wrong exploring the neighborhoods of the District. This was the sixth annual Crafty Bastards put on by the Washington City Paper, so make sure to come out next year to see some of the creations. If you come into some inheritance money or want to get some ideas for do-it-yourself (for those so craftily inclined), it is certainly a recommended place to go.

AU women’s soccer holds sole possession of the top spot in the Patriot League with a 2-0 win over conference rival Holy Cross Friday at their Phil Reeves event.
The Eagles jumped all over the Crusaders early. All but three AU starters appeared on the score sheet as the team had 11 shots in the first half alone. Not only did the team click on offense, but they also had a solid defense, allowing only one shot in the first half. 
While the Eagles did not get on the board in the first half, it did not take long for the tie to be broken in the second half. Senior Kelsey Brasher put the ball up high in the right corner for her sixth goal of the season in the eighth minute of the second half. Just six minutes later AU scored again. This time it was Brooke Sheppard who took a cross by Carleigh Morba and dumped it into a wide open net. It was Sheppard’s first goal of the season. 
AU Head Coach David Bucciero was happy with his team’s perseverance after the game. 
“We had a lot of [high quality] play in the first half, a lot of shots that we didn’t quite get the goals,” Bucciero told AU Athletics. “I like how our team stuck with it and didn’t get frustrated and eventually the goals came.”
It is the teams third win in four games. The victory marked the 13th time this year that the team’s defense did not allow more than two goals. With a lack of consistent offense, the defense has been important to keeping the Eagles’ season alive. 
Despite the 7-7 overall record, AU has looked strong in Patriot League play. The closest teams to AU in the standings are Army and Lehigh who are currently 1-0-1 in the season.  While records are important, it is the points total that determine who is seeded where in the Patriot League Tournament.
In women’s soccer a win counts for three points, a tie is one point and a loss is no points. The Eagles do not have to win out to have a shot at hosting the tournament and a No. 1 seed, but must beat the teams at the top of the standings to have a shot. 
AU’s next game will be against Colgate University on Saturday. The Raiders are 0-1-1 on the season in conference play and 4-6-3 overall.

Clarification Appended
It’s always tough to talk about abortion. It’s a divisive issue on which many good people vehemently disagree. This is true at American as it is across America. On our campus, the Students For Life and Students For Choice organizations both thrive. Both are big; both are active. The abortion debate plays out articulately and passionately, to the credit of all involved. 
This newspaper has no plans to take sides in this struggle, especially because there is diversity of opinion among our editorial board. However, we are supportive of advancing honest and open discourse on this issue, which is why we appreciate the panel discussion AU Students For Choice hosted this past week.
Clearly, “Exposing Fake Clinics” was a pro-abortion rights affair. Wednesday’s panel featured representatives from Planned Parenthood, NARAL, the National Abortion Federation and the Feminist Majority Foundation. It’s safe to say none of these organizations advocate overturning Roe v. Wade or supporting Sarah Palin for president in 2012. Still, social conservatives can and should learn from them. The panel exposed disturbing misinformation campaigns on the part of anti-abortion rights activists, which undermine the anti-abortion cause and embolden pro-abortion rights activists. More importantly, they are harmful to American women, pro-life and pro-choice alike.
According to a Sept. 21 press release from Feminist Majority Foundation, many anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers in this country use “misinformation, fear and shame tactics to coerce and intimidate women out of considering abortion as an option.” Some call condoms a “con job,” completely misrepresenting their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy and disease. Additionally, some CPCs distribute pamphlets that claim abortion leads to an increased risk of breast cancer. The World Health Organization refutes this claim completely.
To be fair, pro-abortion rights organizations can also be guilty of stretching the truth and omitting information harmful to their cause. This should go without saying. But no serious activist on either side of this issue would justify bad behavior by pointing to more bad behavior. In fact, most activists on both sides of this issue would probably agree on a few things.
Given that abortion remains legal in this country, women should be able to access a wide range of accurate information on this sensitive topic. Social conservatives should stop their scare tactics and misinformation. Social liberals should be honest about abortion’s physical and emotional consequences. Abortions are not a walk in the park. They can be gruesome and they raise troubling moral and ethical questions for an increasing number of Americans, including an increasing number of young people.
This issue is divisive and emotional. For many, gray area simply does not exist. But this is all the more reason why our campus and our country deserve an honest, substantive debate. The abortion argument should never be reduced to competing smear campaigns. Precisely because we cannot render this culture war unnecessary, America must fight it fairly. 
Clarification: The term "pro-abortion" was inappropriately used several times in this editorial and should have been "pro-abortion rights." This version of the editorial has been changed to reflect this.

AU volleyball notched another win on Friday night with a 3-0 win against Navy.
After a disappointing result six days earlier against Colgate, the Eagles rolled to an easy 25-16, 25-15, 25-23 straight set victory.
The team came out of the gates fast and furious, jumping out to an early lead in the first set. Thanks to an impressive 6-0 run, the Eagles were able to gain momentum. Navy was able to stick with the Eagles as they fought hard to get the score to 14-10. This was as close as Navy would get in the first set, however. American extended their lead to 17-10 following a Navy error.
Errors plagued Navy all game, and they gave up big points as a result. They finished up the first set giving up an error on AU’s first set point.
The second set saw much of the same from the dominating Eagles. AU yet again used an impressive 6-0 run to jump out to a lead. AU was able to continue to open the lead. At one point, the team was up by 12 points at 17-5. AU did not see much resistance the rest of the game and won the second set easily, going into half time with a 2-0 lead in the match.
Navy did their best to fight their way back into the match, as they made the third set the most competitive of the match. The Eagles again jumped out to an early big lead of 11-5. Navy fought back, however, and stayed tight with the teams sharing the score on eight separate different occasions. AU never tailed and was able to take the important two-point lead and won the third set 25-23.
Sophomore Rebecca Heath led the way for the Eagles with 11 kills, two aces and three digs. Claire Recht was the largest contributor to the team with four total blocks, while Krysta Cicala added 29 assists to the team’s winning efforts.
As a team, the Eagles had an impressive .326 hitting percentage for the match, while committing only 11 errors across the three sets. 
The team will return to action on Tuesday night in Bender Arena when they face William and Mary. AU is sitting at 9-9 on the season with a 3-2 record in the Patriot League. The team has won the Patriot League for the last nine years.

Equestrianism, the skill of riding horses, has commonly been a financially demanding and specialized sport, but the AU Club Equestrian Team offers riders an affordable way to continue riding at the collegiate level. 
Co-founded in the fall of 2003, the team welcomes riders of all ability levels and backgrounds. Members do not have to compete in order to be part of the team.
Generally, the AU student body knows little about this club sport. Riders are hard to spot around campus because they travel to Lakeside Stables in Clarksburg, Md. for practice. There, Coach Jeff Becker provides team members with horses and once-weekly group lessons determined by their ability level. 
Of the 23 riders in the club, the team is only allowed to show 15 of them in competition. In order to give each rider a chance to compete, Becker rotates the lineup every competition. 
In competitions, also known as horse shows, each rider competes individually in equitation or jumping, collecting points for the overall team score and personal placement. The points a rider collects determine when they will advance to the next skill level. 
Many of the team members are involved in equitation, where riders are judged by their form and ability to control the horse.
“Equitation is a lot about showing yourself off and showing how good you look,” said senior Bailey Bearss, president and captain of the team. “A lot of horseback riding is making the connection between you and the horse look effortless, like you are a pair.”
The horses mounted in competition are, for the most part, provided by the host school. Prior to competition, riders draw a Popsicle stick with the name of the horse they will be riding and the rider is not given the opportunity to warm up on the horse.
According to junior Madeline Cohen, the hardest and most nerve-racking part of the equestrian sport is mounting a new horse. 
“It is about being very flexible as a rider and being able to ride a whole slew of different types of horses, because they are all different,” Cohen said.
To prepare his team members for the spontaneity of competition, Becker requires members to ride a different horse each practice. This helps the riders learn to quickly adjust themselves in any situation.
Despite training a young team this season — there are five returning riders — Becker is confident about the incoming talent. At the team’s first competition the weekend of Oct. 3, Becker saw a basis of a successful team being formed.
“They all support each other and help each other,” Becker said. “They really are a good team.”
Being on the team has taught AU’s riders important lessons that they have been able to apply outside of the sport. Sophomore Rachel Tranchik emphasized the patience the equestrian sport has instilled in her.
“With any horse that you have, you have to learn their different tricks. Horses have the tendency to test you,” Tranchik said. “They know who you are and know your strong points and weaknesses, and they use that to their advantage.” 
Becker expects to the team to continue to grow and overcome their nerves and fears at their next showing on Oct. 24 at Goucher College in Baltimore.

Imagine it’s late Saturday night and you and some friends are trying to catch a ride back to campus from Adams Morgan. You can’t find a cab. The last train just left Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan Metro station.
Avoiding this scenario may well become a necessary consideration as a result of the recent taxi strike. Cab drivers all around Adams Morgan are abandoning their 1:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. beats to protest proposed legislation that would restrict the supply of cabs available to D.C. residents. Initially crafted by Councilman Jim Graham, D-Ward 1, the legislation would limit the number of cabs by creating a ‘medallion’ system, where drivers must buy or rent the right to pick up passengers.
Though the proposal has recently been withdrawn — amid a rapidly expanding bribery scandal that resulted in the indictment of Graham’s chief of staff — Councilman Graham should not even have proposed it in the first place. Proponents of the bill argue that limiting the number of cabs available greatly reduces the size of the taxicab industry’s carbon footprint; the bill gives an incentive for this reduction by offering more lenient medallion standards for hybrid cabs. They may also argue this regulation would improve the quality of the District’s taxi services by basically preventing Joe the Plumber from driving a cab when he’s down on his luck.
These points are not well-founded. Any gains made in environmental standards will be more than offset by the reduction in overall competitiveness throughout the industry. 
Instead of improved service, lack of free market competition may encourage complacency among existing drivers. Geographic coverage may contract as these companies emphasize high-margin customers in central areas. For the average student, this could mean fewer cabs actively searching for customers on the fringes of the city or significantly longer wait times for call-in customers.
Furthermore, D.C. cab drivers make only $1.50 per metered mile — the lowest in the nation according to News Channel 8. This is good for consumers, but bad for drivers. These people have families to feed and kids to send to college. Cutting further into their profit margins, or further threatening their livelihood is a terrible idea. 
Further changes to the taxi system may only exacerbate this declination and students should speak out against it. After all, happy cab drivers make for happy rides home.

With the words of hope and spirituality the Dalai Lama brought to AU this past week, there also came the question of religion and the younger generation. As a group coming to adulthood when so much of the status quo has been questioned, are we a group able to follow faith blindly?
Our generation is one that accepts greater sexual freedom. We understand that being gay is not a decision, but rather part of a person. We desire to be colorblind. And we also face the question of whether or not religion is compatible with our modern beliefs. I’ve found that often, it feels as though being religious means being hypocritical. One cannot deny that adhering strictly to religious observances is increasingly difficult. It seems unfair for a Jewish girl in college to have to turn down a night out with friends because a restaurant can’t ensure her plate hasn’t touched meat — not to mention most restaurants within a college budget probably can’t. Being part of a certain faith should make one feel like they are part of a group, not alienate them from others. Yet many students who practice Judaism do not strictly keep kosher and consider themselves highly religious.
One could also point out that this generation’s beliefs contradict those of our religions. Christianity, for example, encourages followers to sacrifice their own well-being in order to ensure the wellbeing of others. To give without expectation is to practice faith; to accept and forgive others is to do the work of God. However, the church does not recognize gay marriage; thus, we are asked to not accept our friends in gay relationships. We are asked, in a sense, to stand against the well-being of our friends. 
When religions are morally opposed to groups of people, one must wonder if we can stand as one united group of people, hoping to do the best for everyone. It has long been true that religion has been the cause of most wars in history. One could even argue that religion is behind the wars of our political parties. Is there any hope for young Americans to practice a faith and practice what we feel is right?
I would like to think so. We are of a different mindset than many of our parents, as they are of our grandparents. There was once a time where your wedding kiss was supposed to be your first. Social norms have changed a lot since then, but religion has remained a constant — an unchanging facet of life that holds us in common with our ancestors. 
This is why it’s no surprise that religion will follow us through graduation — if faith and morality made it through the ‘70s, it can make it through anything. We will have religion as long as we take faith as it takes us: as a whole, overlooking some of our lesser characteristics.
The fact that we can practice religion that we may not agree with 100 percent gives me great hope. It shows that we have open minds; while we may not agree with all parts, we stand for what the whole stands for. The fact that our generation still practices religion — 81 percent of freshmen students at UCLA, according to a university study, shows that we are comfortable being ourselves, despite how our beliefs may be different. If our generation can keep this open-mindedness and welcome the fact that other people have different opinions, we may be in a much better place come 20 years.

AU junior Hannah Weitzman picked up her first career victory and sophomore Melissa Casale had two goals in the field hockey team’s 5-1 win over Colgate University Saturday. 
With the win, AU moves to 6-5 on the year and 2-0 in the Patriot League conference. The win is the second game in a row where the Eagles scored at least five goals. AU’s defense also stepped up allowing only two shots throughout the whole game. 
It did not take long for the Eagles to get on the board. Just under two minutes in, Casale took a long pass up the right sideline from Anne van Erp and slipped it past the Colgate goalie for a 1-0 lead. AU would add two more goals in the half, from senior Rachel Carney and another from junior Christine Fingerhuth. The team’s two other goals came late in the second half from Sarah Millman and Casale for her second on the day.
Even though the team had a strong day on defense as well as offense, they did seem to lose their composure several times. The Eagles started both halves with a number of fouls and allowed seven penalty corners. While none of them got by Weitzman or the AU defense, it still demonstrated some sloppy play. 
AU has a big game next Saturday against Bucknell University, who also won on Saturday. The winner will claim the top spot in Patriot League with a perfect conference record. While the Bison have a better overall record at 7-4, they are tied with AU for two conferences wins each.
There are only three Patriot League games left and the Eagles will look to go undefeated in conference play for the seventh straight year. AU was the early favorite to take the conference coming into the season. If AU wins the regular season they will host the Patriot League tournament starting Nov. 6. 
AU starters have 18 goals on the season, and the team has 29 total. Opponents have only scored 17 total goals on 84 shots — about half of the number of AU shots. Senior Savannah Graybill is leading the team in game winning goals. 
There are only five regular season games remaining. Of those five, three of them are at home where the Eagles are 2-2. AU’s last game of the regular season is Nov. 1 at home against Lehigh University.

Since arriving at AU, I’ve had some great times at the Terrace Dinning Room and some less-than-excellent experiences at TDR too. The Eat Local Challenge Day was wonderful, for example. Honeycrisp apples, cider and other fresh options — all in all, it was a prime TDR experience. But food choices aside, there are a few things that we can do to make TDR experiences better for everyone.
Stop throwing silverware: I honestly have trouble believing that this is an issue for college students, but sure enough, it is. This past Thursday, one of my friends got hit in the side by a flying fork. Somehow it “slipped out of some kid’s hand” from the opposite side of the dining hall. Luckily, she wasn’t hurt, but she definitely could have been, and as TDR is not a war-zone, no one should feel the need to duck and cover while eating dinner. For all of you who are still as mature as middle-school kids: forks, spoons and other eating utensils are not meant to fly, especially halfway across the room. Bon Appétit believes that we are all grown-up enough to handle metal silverware. Let’s not make them change their minds and relegate all of us to the plastic sporks we used in elementary school. 
Clean messy tables: I have no desire to walk into TDR to find that the only tables that are empty are covered with dirty silverware, empty hot sauce bottles and used napkins. If we all take the responsibility to clean up after ourselves, we won’t have this problem. Really, it’s not that difficult to clean up your table. The trash cans and dirty silverware containers are right next to where you deposit your dirty plates and where you exit. 
Behave better in lines: TDR is as much a social experience as it is a culinary one. We all enjoy talking to our friends while waiting in what are inevitably long lines, but be cognizant of your surroundings as well. When there’s a gap of five feet or more between you and the person in line in front of you for Comfort Zone, it’s probably a good idea to move up. Not only will this make you much more popular with the irritated and hungry people in line behind you, but it also won’t cause the length of the comfort food line to get in the way of people trying to get french fries at the American Grill. 
Push in chairs: after one meal at one of TDR’s long tables, it is pretty obvious that whoever decided to put long, curving tables close together was not the engineer of the century. Especially if you’re sitting at the wall-end of the long tables, it’s nearly impossible to navigate the tiny corridor that exists between two tables’ chairs. If you try to sit up to the table and push your chair in when you leave, you’ll save everyone a lot of hassle, and yourself from being pummeled with purses and book bags as people try to squeeze behind you. 
Throw away mint wrappers: mints are the best way to end a TDR experience, but don’t be one of those people who throw their wrappers on the floor while walking up the stairs. Really, there are trashcans all over the place. Utilize them. 
If we all obey this simple guide to TDR etiquette, the experience that is TDR will be much better for everyone. Really, it’s not that hard. We all have at least once in our lives been polite and courteous to our classmates. Let’s spread that civility to TDR.

With time winding down in the second overtime, the Eagles men’s soccer team flew down the field with the ball and junior Mike Worden, alone in front of the Lafayette goalie, struck the ball into the net to end a sensational comeback, beating the visiting Leopards 2-1.
Although it was not the best of games for the team, the Eagles moved into first place in the conference standings, remaining undefeated against Patriot League opponents. The win also improved their overall record to 6-3-1 on the season.
For the Eagles, the first half resembled the weather: unpleasant and sloppy. The Eagles could not seem to break through the Leopard defense consistently as a group. Passes were intercepted, and many of the drives were stopped before the Eagles could even execute a shot. The Eagles’ sophomore Jack Scott was able to dribble near the goalbox and shoot it towards the right side of the net in the 33rd minute but was unsuccessful. The Leopards took advantage of the Eagles lack of composure soon after. In the 35th minute, the Leopards lifted the ball into the goalbox where Eagles goalie Matt Makowski jumped up to snag the ball. Unfortunately, the ball slipped past his gloves and Lafayette’s Josh Brown scored the first goal of the game into an empty net, putting them up to 1-0. 
“For whatever reason, we came out flat,” Coach Todd West said of the first half. “You don’t expect it when it’s two first-place teams in a conference game [...] we challenged their mental toughness under pressure, and they obviously stepped up.”
In the second half, the Eagles continued to struggle on the offensive side. Their frustration showed with bad shots and a yellow card for misconduct. With five minutes left in the game, the Eagles saw their chances at victory perishing. However, they suddenly came out with an intensity reflective of last week’s victory against Army.
The Eagles made several contesting shots against the Leopards, but, none of them went in. Then, with 50 seconds remaining in regulation, junior Nick Kapus booted a free kick past Leopards goalie Andrew Pianko into the left side of the net to tie the score at 1-1, sending the game into overtime.    
In the first overtime, neither team scored, but the second one proved different. With four minutes left from a draw, the Eagles Mike Worden received a long pass ahead of the defense. With only the goalie to beat, Worden chipped the ball into the Leopard’s net, before being mobbed by ecstatic Eagle fans and players.
Both teams came into the game having ended in a draw in their last three meetings. Lafayette had the edge based on their overall record. But, the victory added to AU’s winning-streak against Patriot League opponents, now at four games. After being held to six shots in the first half, AU retaliated to outshoot Lafayette 21-15. They also received four yellow cards. 
The AU Men’s Soccer team will step onto Reeves‘ Field this Tuesday to face Pennsylvania at 3 p.m.

The fall season is inevitably upon us, and the quintessential American autumnal activities, including hayrides, searching for Halloween costumes and drinking pumpkin spice lattes, are more than abundant. However, why not spend next weekend doing something with a bit more international flair?
The perfect opportunity awaits right around the corner, at the Gunston Arts Center in Arlington, Va. The theater will host the 12th International Festival of Hispanic Theater starting this coming weekend. 
The festival, put on by the local non-profit Teatro de la Luna, runs Oct. 13 until Nov. 21. Teatro de la Luna strives “to provide the Washington capital area — both its Spanish-speaking community and its English-speaking community as well — with a source of high quality theater as seen from a Latin American perspective,” according to their Web site. 
Through programs and events such as the upcoming International Festival, Teatro de la Luna aims to bridge cultural divides and foster understanding of Latin American culture in the District. 
The first play of the festival is “El Insomnio Americano,” running from Oct. 15 to Oct. 17. The performance will be put on by the Saulo García Inc. troupe and stars Saulo García himself. 
“El Insomnio Americano” is a comedic portrayal of a Columbian man, García, and his time in Miami amongst thousands of other Latin American immigrants. Despite their grand hopes and dreams of a great life in America, the play showcases the harsh realities they encounter. 
“More a partially ad-libbed monologue than a scripted play, ‘El Insomnio Americano’ is by turns hilarious, emotional, touching and, in the end, true to life,” the festival’s press release stated.
The play has received a fair amount of coverage, as it has already been performed in many off-Broadway theaters across the country. García is an acclaimed actor who has won several awards, including New York’s First Olympics of Humor in 2003, the press release said.
Despite his award-winning talent, García is most known for co-founding Los Marinillos, a Columbian musical/comedy company in 1983. The troupe reached remarkable fame in Columbia in their 15 years together. 
In addition to hosting the Saulo García Inc. troupe, the International Festival of Hispanic Theater will also highlight comedy and music troupes from six other countries, including Argentina, Uruguay and Venezuela. 
The Grupo TeaTeatro troupe from Argentina is putting on the drama “Abanico de Soltera (Fan of a Single Woman),” in its first U.S. performance, between Oct. 22 and Oct. 24. According to the press release, “the play is an homage to Federico García Lorca, recreating his magic universe through an encounter with the ghosts of his characters.”
The play is highly anticipated, winning Best Show and Best Actress in the VII Festival de Teatro, “Rosario em cena,” in 2007, as well as Best One-Person Show in the Festival Iberoamericano de Teatro, “Cumbre de las Americas,” in 2005. 
Tickets for all of the plays being performed at the festival are $25 for students and seniors, $30 for regular admission, $10 for children and free for children younger than 4 years old. 
The festival is also offering a discount of $10 if you buy three tickets for three different shows. Other extra features include a post-performance discussion after Friday night shows, as well as free live English dubbing, since all the shows are performed in Spanish. 
Theater Two of the Gunston Arts Center, the host of the festival, is located at Gunston Middle School and Community Center at 2700 S. Lang St. in Arlington, Va. and is accessible from either the Crystal City or Pentagon City Metro stops. 
For more information or to make reservations, call 703-548-3092 or 202-882-6227, or visit Teatro de la Luna’s Web site at www.teatrodelaluna.org.

Crisis pregnancy centers, which are usually funded by non-profit, anti-abortion organization, can give women misleading and untruthful information about pregnancy, contraception and abortions, according to a panel discussion hosted by AU Students for Choice.
The panel discussion, “Exposing Fake Clinics,” was held Wednesday, Oct. 7 and consisted of Dr. Laura Meyers from Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, Diana Onken from NARAL Pro-Choice America, Wendy Matheny from the Feminist Majority Foundation and Lisa Brown from the National Abortion Federation. They discussed the issues surrounding crisis pregnancy centers.
CPCs usually do not offer comprehensive medical services or options that include abortion services, counseling or referrals. 
“CPCs use misinformation, fear and shame tactics to coerce and intimidate women out of considering abortion as an option. Many CPCs go further — discouraging the use of contraception, even claiming that condoms are a ‘con’ job,’” according to a Sept. 21 press release from the Feminist Majority Foundation, a non-profit feminist organization.
Amanda Pelletier, the national affiliate liaison for AU Students for Choice and the organizer of the panel discussion, said she thinks CPCs are dangerous for women. 
“A lot of times they’ll advertise free pregnancy tests, and the person on hand will tell them, ‘Oh, you’re not pregnant,’ and so the woman will leave thinking that she’s not pregnant, and she’ll go on living her life as if she wasn’t pregnant ... that stalls the time in which she can have an abortion, and the procedure does become a little bit more risky.” 
Care Net, a national network of CPCs, lists two centers near AU on their Web site. The Northwest Center is about two and a half miles from campus and the Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center is about six miles from campus.
A spokesperson for the Northwest Center said the center offers free pregnancy tests, material assistance and referrals to health, adoption and legal services. The center does not offer any medical services, including ultrasounds. The Northwest Center tabled at the Wellness Fair in September.
The Student Health Center does not refer students to the Northwest Center, according to Dan Bruey, director of the Student Health Center.
The Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center did not respond to phone calls or e-mails from The Eagle. According to its Web site, the center “serves the Gospel of Jesus Christ by providing intervention and abortion alternatives for women and men facing crisis pregnancies.” They also offer free pregnancy tests and confidential counseling, according to their Web site. 
Katie Koch, the president of AU Students for Life, said in an e-mail that, “the clinics in D.C. (including the Capitol Hill Pregnancy Care Center) do not pretend to be more than they are. They do not offer medical services and would never claim to.” 
The Northwest Center does not provide any medical services and is not a medical clinic, according to a spokesperson for the center.
During the panel, speakers discussed issues surrounding CPCs, such as the way the centers advertise, and the practices they engage in to try to prevent women from getting an abortion. 
Pamphlets given out by CPCs state that abortion leads to an increased risk of breast cancer, depression and suicide, negatively effects future fertility, and leads to other health issues. According to the World Health Organization, induced abortion does not increase the risk of breast cancer. 
“AU Students for Life works closely with the Capitol Hill Pregnancy Care Center,” Koch said. “At this center, volunteer peer counselors are not allowed to tell a woman that abortion is evil, but they will present her with facts about the procedure that an abortion clinic will not.”
A 2006 report by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., “False and Misleading Health Information Provided by Federally Funded Pregnancy Resource Centers,” stated that during an investigation of 23 CPCs that received federal grants, “20 of the 23 centers (87 percent) provided false or misleading information about the health effects of abortion.”
Pregnancy resource centers received approximately $1 million through the Compassion Capital Fund, created in 2002 as a component of the Bush Administration’s faith-based initiative, according to the report. The report also said that CPCs received over $24 million in Community-Based Abstinence Education funds between 2001 and 2005, and at least $6 million from abstinence funding provided to states.
