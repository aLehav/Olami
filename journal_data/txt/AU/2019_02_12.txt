University President Sylvia Burwell discusses her diversity and inclusion strategy during an interview in January 2018. 
In a conference call hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 30, University President Sylvia Burwell discussed the ways in which AU is addressing mental health challenges on campus as well as how universities should work with employers to create support networks for graduates. 
While the call was organized in response to Burwell’s article “Exploring the Mental Health Crisis” published in the council’s magazine, Foreign Affairs, last October, Burwell answered a wide range of questions regarding mental health both on AU and campuses nationally. The call was open to the public and included both faculty and student listeners from universities across the country.
Burwell began the conversation by explaining what led her to write about campus mental health and why she thinks it is an important topic to emphasize in higher education. 
“If you look at national statistics, you see 39 percent of college students reporting experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety in the 2016-2017 academic year,” Burwell said. “And the percentage of students who receive therapy has jumped from 13 to 24 percent from 2007 to 2017.”
She identifies three areas in which she believes most of the students’ mental health issues stem from: economics, safety and technology. The Eagle previously reported on these arguments, which are featured prominently in Burwell’s article, as well as on the backlash the article received from AU students. 
During the call, Burwell discussed ways in which AU is combating what she referred to as a “public health issue.” Some changes and administrative policies included adding more mental health counselors, adding “curricular engagement to AUx 1 and 2” and “changing the way that [Title IX] investigations occur.” 
AUx refers to the mandatory freshman curriculum meant to help students transition to college during their first two semesters at AU. In addition, the University has implemented reforms to its approach to Title IX cases in the past few years following a string of federal Title IX complaints filed against the University. Some of those reforms will likely be affected by new rules proposed by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. 
Burwell said her efforts to improve mental health have extended into external networks that she hopes will better prepare students for life beyond AU. 
“Our work with employers is growing and is an important part of why I wrote the piece,” Burwell said. “I think we need to think about how we work hand in glove so the support systems that we’re building on university campuses and the things that we’re trying to do are reinforced when students go to that next step of employment.”

A 1958 Talon photo depicts a man speaking to an audience in blackface. 
Following several stories about the history of blackface on college campuses, officials at American University say they have found similarly racist photos in the archives of AU’s student yearbook. 
In a Monday email memo to the AU community, Provost Daniel Myers and Vice President of Campus Life and Inclusive Excellence Fanta Aw said they directed library staff and faculty to undertake a review of issues of The Talon and its predecessor, AUCOLA, which were published from 1926 to 2009.

In those yearbooks, staff identified 15 photos, cartoons and drawings “of concern,” Myers and Aw wrote. Both administrators condemned the "abhorrent" images and the pain they have caused.
“Some clearly reflect racism, bigotry and ignorance toward African-Americans, Native Americans and Asian Americans,” they wrote. “Others will require more context to fully understand their meaning.” 
The Eagle reviewed online archives of the yearbooks ranging from 1926 to 1998 (AU does not have copies of yearbooks from 1999 to 2009 on its website). The analysis revealed at least four images depicting students in blackface, including pictures of fraternity members performing in a minstrel show. The photos range in date from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, with the last blackface photo appearing in 1963. 
Minstrel shows, which featured white performers in blackface, have historically purported racist stereotypes about black people due to the exaggerated costumes and makeup that distort the features and culture of African-Americans, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture.
The history of blackface has been in the spotlight due to the discovery of a racist photo on Virginia Governor Ralph Northam’s medical school yearbook page that depicts a person in blackface and another person in a Ku Klux Klan hood.
Other images showed people wearing Native American, Egyptian and Middle Eastern costumes. Those photos range in date from 1965 through 1991, when several students are pictured wearing Native American headdresses and makeup during a school event. 
In other photographs from the yearbooks, figures are shown hanging in effigy from campus buildings. It’s unclear from the images what the effigies are depicting. 
In their message, Myers and Aw said they will tap the expertise of AU scholars to work with archivists to coordinate efforts to review the “significance and history of these images,” adding that community members should “stay tuned for details.” 
“The images we have found require more than discovery, transparency, and apology; they deserve candid acknowledgement and action,” they wrote. “As we further develop our Plan for Inclusive Excellence, we must understand where we have been to inform where we are going.”

Clarification: Two photos have been removed from the slideshow because The Eagle could not confirm their exact context and ties to racist imagery.
