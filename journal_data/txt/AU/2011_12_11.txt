•@junior guy losing hope in love: So am I. It's starting to scare me that I'm starting to be okay with it too. I don't know what it's like to truly love and be loved. You're not alone! xoxo, a nice little freshman girl sending you hugs



•@smokers please don't litter: the only reason I don't throw cigarettes in the trash can is because I'm always afraid that my cigarette is not fully put out and that it's gonna set fire to the trash.
•@"This is the quiet floor". Try studying in McKinley building. Although it isn't designated as a quiet building, it is often way more quiet than the library. Same goes with Kreeger, Watkins, and Gray.
•I actually saw Neil Kerwin walking through campus the other day, and almost died of shock
•I love AU so much. I'm so glad I didn't go to my state school where everyone is from the same state, has the same political views, and the same provincial world view. At AU I get to meet people from all over the country and all over the world. And not just a couple students, but in every single class at AU. So glad I chose AU.
•I hate that you're flirtatious by nature. It creates feelings in me I know you don't share. I'm really happy to be your friend and am proud to know you trust me with your issues. But now I have feelings for you, and that can't be good for either of us.
•The awkward look guys give you when they find out your ring is a purity ring......
•I feel like ranting should not be the place that you come out of the closet...
•Irene was a joke compared to Wednesday night.  A poorly timed, inappropriate, fart joke.
•There should be like buttons for individual rants.
•I don't want to go home... I'm happier here in DC <3
•Dear Big, I know you read eagle rants so listen up. You chose me, remember? And I chose you? We were so happy that first semester. Then you went abroad and I tried so hard to make time for you, despite my personal issues. Then you came back and acted like nothing changed. I worked so hard to try and talk to you, but you were "too busy". This semester I'm abroad and have emailed you, messaged you, skyped you... with no responses. What did I do to make you not like me? I just want to get an answer.
•I know I'm not supposed to talk about it, but I'm pretty sure my neighbors use their apartment for a Fight Club. That's the only rational explanation for all of those noises...
•AU is SO. SMALL.
•Why doesn't my boyfriend like cuddling more??? I DON'T UNDERSTANDDDDDDDDD
•I think my friends are telling me I'm pretty because they don't want me to give up hope on the closeted lesbian and bisexual ladies.  please come out, come out wherever you are.
•why is it so cold in the library? :( I have so much to do but I can't work like this
•@Nothing about being single could make me happier than finding out your ex boyfriend is now a misogynist frat boy douchebag.- I feel you. Brings a smile to my face to hear others talk about his attitude, and say what I'm thinking.
•Thanks for all the suggestions for essay-writing soundtracks! I now love Bastion btw. Perhaps because the music reminds me of Firefly.
•@SGShouldn'tAcceptVIPSeats: Actually, the only times people on SG get VIP seats is when their organization co-sponsors the event. KPU and SUB are very strict on who gets VIP seats, and SG members are in no way allowed to just go because of their position. If you want to get a VIP seat, ask KPU or SUB if an organization you're involved in can co-sponsor!
•I'm the only one of my friends who have not had finals yet... all of their facebook statuses are killing me.
•Thank You Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin!
•This is supposed to be an incredibly open, diverse, and accepting school right? Everyone, regardless of race/creed/sexual orientation is supposed to be accepted right? Except Republicans appear to be the exception. All the time. And it's gone farther than joking - now it is starting to really hurt.
•Why aren't my rants about sex being posted? Are we not allowed to rant about sex?
[Editor’s note: It was probably over 100 words or had profanity.]
•I kissed a girl and I liked it. hope you're ready for this babe.
•"Hmmm, assuming you’re a student, what year are you?" WOAH! Try another question. Yes or no questions please. If not, then you could ask "what's your name?" and I would be forced to say...
[Editor’s note: You didn’t specify yes/no questions. But fine, are you in SOC?]
•Is Silicon the same in Spanish? Si
•I'm happy my chemistry jokes get a "reaction" out of you guys :-)
[Editor’s note: Hehehe.]
•Your new boy toy is really ugly. Good riddance and good luck with that one!
•You're not boring. I'm just bored with you.
•Considering napping in the library. No shame.
•I was sexually harassed (is that the word?) in the men's bathroom in the basement of the library. I in a position to get help, but I just hid from him in the stall until left, so it wasn't necessary. Needless to say, I'm shaken by it, but I don't fell like I can tell anyone because nothing ended up happening beyond the above...
I've learned two things: (1) those rape stickers in the bathrooms are absolutely vital, and (2) I can never imagine what rape victims must feel like, given how I feel bc of this
[Editor’s note: First, sexual harassment is against University policy and the student conduct code. Even though “nothing ended up happening,” as you said, you have every right to talk to someone, whether it be a friend, counselor or AU staffer, and to report the incident if you want to. If you want more information on sexual harassment and assault at AU, you can look through AU’s resource page: http://www.american.edu/ocl/dos/sexualassault/. If you’re just looking to talk, maybe try the Counseling Center at 202-885-3500. I’m sure other ranters have ideas as well.]
•Anyway, I guess I'll just make sure I attend the "rape is bad" parade again this year... Idk...
•I wish we weren't so complicated. I wish you weren't so medicated.
•I hate it when people think the glass study rooms in the library are sound proof. THEY ARE NOT. The whole entire floor can hear your conversation. You biddies have no right to disturb the students in the library who actually care about their work. Also, wtf are you wearing? Mini skirts don't constitute winter clothing, and 30 pounds of make-up won't replace a lack of personality. Why has our society let this happen, and why are there are so many people like you at AU??
•Now don't get me wrong, I'm super excited for Winter Break. But I want the chance to hang out with you actually before break to know if something is there! Why is break coming so fast now??
•AU should have a graffiti rock.
•Dear Roommate:
You do not look that great in that attire, despite your assertions to the contrary, you look dumpy and like a disheveled old physics professor, you need some decent clothes hombre.
•Ah Paultards... you guys are so silly I almost feel bad for you.
•If you are a guy taller than 5'8, with a beautiful body, who knows random nerdy facts and is extremely sarcastic. HMU
•A hahaha... Editor is having a conversation with a Ranter.
[Editor’s note: Agreed.]
•"Normal" student here graduating in three years. #globalscholarscansuckit
•It makes me so happy to know that all the girls you are now hooking up with are unattractive skanks. I hope you get herpes. Sincerely, your ex.
•Someone on this quiet floor is ranting about me and my friends being too loud. Im sorry but my friend was too drunk last night not to be laughing while reiterating her actions to her
•Dear roommate: You can't be in this room forever, some time, some day, I will find your computer when you aren't at it, and I will delete all of your annoyingly repetitive music (because you always listen to the same crap) so you can broaden your horizons. And I WILL BE FREE!
•I used to think Ringbom was hot. Now its more like Douchebom...
•ladies who responded to my plea:
thank you, it's nice to hear some encouragement! just wish it was easier to pick out girlswholikegirls. and to "your latent lesbian lover," i wish this wasn't so anonymous, haha. but good luck finding me next semester, i can definitely wait for you ;)
-still waiting
•I wish Danny Mack was straight.
•I really hate printing dollars...
•anderson third floor is too much to handle.
•Dear people who like brag about how much work they do,
1. We all do a lot of work. Get over yourself.
2. No one cares that you went 320 words over the word limit for your paper.  In fact, word limits exist so you don't talk about unnecessary information. Oh, I guess that didn't stop you from bringing this conversation up either.
Sincerely,
Annoyed person that is far from impressed.
•"White people have feelings too. I'm not racist at all, but when you say things like "I hate all white people, they are all racist", THAT MAKES YOU RACIST. So if you don't want to be discriminated agaisnt, don't discriminate. It's a two way street."
One of the key parts of racism is one group having power over another.  Sure, you could argue that we have a black president but let's be real, there still is a huge amount of discrimination against black people in many parts of our country.  Clearly, AU DOES need to change the Dean's list.
•SIS people,
I wonder what David Hume would think of you...but sadly we'll never know.
Sincerely,
Real metaphysics
•nothing good happens after 2am...
•I can't wait to detriple for spring semester.  I've hit my head on the bunk above me too many times in the past few months!  I wouldn't be surprised if I sustained a concussion from today's smack to the head. FML.
•@quiet floor ranter
I DO WHAT I WANT.
•The world ended last night.  And I have the pictures to prove it.
•@Not-SPA/Poli-Sci major: YES! Let's be friends :)
•REALLY LEO 6?! REALLY?! I thought there was a banana rotting away when it was a bloddy tampon on the shelf in the shower. And I thought part of the shower floor was rippping off when it was a used condom. First a pregnancy test left on the toilet seat, now this?!!? LOOK AT YOUR LIFE, LOOK AT YOUR CHOICES. Clean up after yourself, please.
•I don't even know how many times I orgasmed last night...
•Hey boy. I like you. I think. Let's watch more movies together..
•I'm tired of these mixed signals.  I don't want to be another random hookup.  If you like me, then show it and do something about it, but if you're going to tell me you like being my friend and then hook up with me, I'm done.
•It sucks when boy X shows so much interest in you but you don't like him. And boy Y has finally made his move  to an extent but you  just wish it were boy Z that made his move already.
