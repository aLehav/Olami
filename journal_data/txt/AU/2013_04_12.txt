• i am a sophomore and just had my mind blown by the water bottle sensor on the water fountains in the library
• Having to obtain an abortion junior or senior year is the worst. I thought I was going to have to get an abortion this semester, and I was terrified of not being able to get one in time. 
• @other girl who likes pregnancy porn: OMG, I feel much better about myself now too. I'm curious to know more about you. What is your major? What are your life goals? Why do you think you like pregnancy porn? I'm a psyc major. I fantasize about getting married and pregnant on a regular basis, but I never admit it to anyone for fear I will be seen as un-feminist.
• Can anyone recommend other annonymous forums similar to eagle rants? I need some diversity.
• You guys do realize there are plenty of colleges around the country that don't have air conditioning in their dorms at all, right? Also, it's only 80. Grow a pair and quit complaining.
• I've always gotten the impression that AU has a whole underground community of racist homophobic bigots...
• Where did all the frat parties go?! Is it too much to ask to have normal college things to do on the weekend? 
• Why do I even try with this being pretty thing? 
• @@did you give me a fake number? rude. If you didnt want anything to do with me say so: With that attitude, why would anyone?' I'm not the OP but really? being upset about being given a fake number is a bad attitude?
• omg abortion is not infanticide and you clearly missed out on it being a joke
• As a computer geek guy: turning me off and on again, and learning to troubleshoot problems effectively.
• my mom reads eagle rants
• Pat Kelly was cleaning the quad today.  Swoon!
• Dear freshman biddies on the shuttle: please stop shrieking about how much alcohol you have in your purse. We still don't think you're cool. Sincerely, everyone over the age of 14. 
• @lizziemcguireranter assuming that there's only one of me, I am very flattered :)  Thank you- Currently without a Gordo 
• Are the two rants about nerds/computer geeks from the same person, or is there like a high demand for that?  Where do I go to get these ladies to flock to me, and how do I call attention to the fact that I am a computer geek?  Is there a special scent or pheromone I should be aware of, or should I just talk loudly to myself about programming and algorithms and databases, etc, etc?
• Shout out to A6S for committing the most amount of floorcest I have seen in my three years at AU so far.
Sincerely,
The observant
• I have a crush on my RA but he doesn't play for the same team I do..
• Remember when memes were not shouted on the quad by dudebros but rather relegated to dark corners of the internet populated by 30 year old virgins where no normal person would tread? 4chan remembers, and so does Pepperidge Farm.
• @22 close to graduating never kissed
Don't worry, there are plenty of guys out there in the same boat, myself included...
• @infanticide commenter
That's funny, I see no mention of infanticide on these rants. I see a highly facetious conversation about abortion, but that is the same thing like talking about stepping on acorns is akin to logging oak trees.
• Sometimes my dating en devours go so poorly I expect everything to cut to black and have the text "Executive Producers Joss Whedon & David Greenwalt" super imposed on it.
• remember when SIS actually had capstone level topics classes for undergrads.. oh wait.
• @"HOLY CRAP I AM ALSO A STRAIGHT FEMALE WITH A FETISH FOR PREGNANCY PORN. Holy. Crap. I feel so much better about myself now that I know I

The alternative rockers of OK Go will bring their power pop sounds to the Tavern on April 27 in the last Student Union Board concert of the semester. 
Admission is free for students and each student may bring one guest. 
OK Go may be the only band more known for its music videos than for its actual music. Although many enjoy their upbeat, indie rock, its most famous for its intricately choreographed, low-budget music videos. 
At the height of its popularity in 2006, the band released their most popular video for their song "Here It Goes Again." The Grammy-winning video, which went viral and became one of the most viewed music videos on Youtube, features the band members doing an intricate dance involving six treadmills. 

The band's last album, 2010's "Of the Blue Colour of the Sky," was released on the band's own record label after the band parted ways with their former label EMI. Though "Of the Blue Colour" didn't reach the kind of viral success of their previous album "Oh No," the dancier sound fared fairly well with critics. 
The two videos for "This Too Shall Pass," the lead single on "Of the Blue Colour of the Sky," won several UK Music Video Awards and an award at the 2010 LA Film Fest.

• Three secrets to happiness: Trusting yourself, loving the people around you, and great physical strength.  All three are key.
• i threw your s**t into a bag and pushed it down the stairs...
• People who blast their headphones on the silent floor: did you miss the point of silent? Just because you think no one else can hear your music, it doesn't mean it's quiet. A little noise is ok, but a full on rave in the next cubicle over is not appreciated. 
• I'm convinced that there are only 3 people on this campus who actually care about hall wars. True Story.
