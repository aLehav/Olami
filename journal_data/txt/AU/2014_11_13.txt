Note: This post contains spoilers for season 16, episode seven of “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” entitled “Chicago Crossover.”
The sixteenth season of “Law and Order: Special Victims Unit” begins with what fans and Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) have always wanted: Olivia finally getting the chance to be the mom we all knew she could be. 
But with a show like SVU, happy moments are often cloudy. For starters, Noah’s (Olivia’s foster baby) mother, Ellie Porter (Emma Greenwell, “Shameless”), was murdered last season, and the man who greenlit her death is still roaming the streets. Nick Amaro (Danny Pino, “The Shield), Olivia’s old partner, has moved from detective to patroller and luckily, the first prostitute he finds as a patroller, Luna Garcia (Alexa Mansour), happens to be pimped out by the same people as Ellie. But Luna Garcia won’t talk, and neither will any of the other witnesses.
And then the story continues on in the same way roughly one fourth of all “SVU” episodes do: 
But since “SVU” is a far better show than it was a few years ago, the writers know how to hit a little closer to home and throw in a threat against Olivia’s new baby. 
Little Tino (Gavin-Keith Umeh), who is imprisoned for killing Ellie, suggests to Olivia that she might want to back off of the case. Of course, Olivia does exactly the opposite, putting her baby’s life in danger, and in the process, meeting two different prostitutes who happen to be mothers as well. As usual, Olivia appeals to one by convincing the prostitute Selena to put her son’s needs ahead of her own, and all ends well. 
But can Olivia make the same sacrifice?  
A new face has also entered the Manhattan SVU. Detective Sonny Carisi (Peter Scanavino, “Frances Ha”) joined after a string of failed stints in the police departments of the other boroughs. The audience can’t make much of Carisi off of this episode, but so far, he’s a law student at Fordham who respects Olivia as a sergeant, which is refreshing to see.
Rollins (Kelli Giddish, “All My Children”) and Fin (Ice-T),  don’t get much screentime, and Nick’s personal problems are never mentioned, but that’s okay. It’s never been the show’s style to deal with more than one issue at a time.
The episode ends with Olivia delivering the good news to Noah. The man who ordered the killing for his mom is dead. The season opener closed one story line, but left plenty open for the rest of the season. 
Tune into Law and Order:SVU on Wednesdays at 9 p.m.

I'm gonna be honest, I tried really hard to make a connection to this week's batch of episodes and this weekend's viral video sensation "Too Many Cooks." No direct/clever similarity (besides the absurd number of characters) presented itself, so here we are. Onto my general conclusions about watching “The Wire” in 2014.
The Wire makes a point to contrast types of law enforcement, specifically the FBI with the Baltimore police department. The post-9/11 changes made to national security impacted all levels of policing, effectively or not. In "The Wire's" case, it's not. 
According to “The Wire,” law enforcement is all about red tape, bureaucracy and pleasing the higher-ups. It's hard to think of a show on today that's making a similar political statement, when today's police procedurals are either syndicated to death or infused with some kind of supernatural or superhero element. They're just too much more formulaic than "The Wire" to make greater social statements or to even hold my interest. I was supremely interested in this week’s round of violent episodes, so here’s a quick recap of the action:
Episode 9, “Stray Rounds” 
The Barksdale crew and a rival drug organization have a gunfight, which ends up killing a young boy who was inside a nearby house. The Baltimore police department carries out a large scale operation to arrest as many drug dealers/participants as possible, and Preston “Boadie” Broadus is brought in. Stringer Bell deals with the repercussions of the fight and contemplates making a deal to share territory. Brother Mouzone (Michael Potts, “True Detective”), a feared enforcer in the drug business, arrives from New York to handle the territory situation.
The Sobotka detail continues their investigation, and McNulty goes undercover to a brothel in an attempt to connect the location to the dead girls from the shipping container. McNulty's success at the brothel comes as a surprise to no one. Ziggy Sobotka begins selling stolen cars, as Nicky and Frank deal with other business. Ziggy's duck dies, and my heart shattered into a thousand pieces.
 
Episode 10, “Storm Warnings” 
The beginning of Episode 10 made me smile so wide: I love a good montage that fades into source music, especially when Johnny Cash’s “Walk the Line” is used.
Ziggy Sobotka and Johnny “Fifty” Spamanto (Jeffrey Pratt Gordon, “Wedding Crashers”) steal cars and sell them to George "Double G" Glekas (Teddy Cañez, “Now You See Me”), who works for the Greek. After a dispute over Ziggy’s cut of the profit, Ziggy shoots and kills Glekas and wounds one of his employees. Ziggy is arrested, while Frank Sobotka attempts to run for union secretary again. I only just now noticed Ziggy's knuckle tattoos.
Major Stan Valchek expresses his frustration with the Sobotka detail’s progress away from Frank himself, while the detail involves the FBI with the case. Valchek continues to degrade the detail and insults Roland “Prez” Pryzbylewski, who punches Valchek and leaves the detail. McNulty and his FBI contact, Terrance "Fitz" Fitzhugh (Doug Olear, ) discover the Greeks of the Sobotka organization have an inside man at the FBI. Their smuggling business reaches across the country, and has been operating for many years. Members of the Greeks, aware of police surveillance, begin to dump the drugs and shut down the operation. 
The Barksdale operation copes with the Brother Mouzone problem, and Joseph "Proposition Joe" Stewart (Robert F. Chew, “Homicide: Life on the Street”) suggests that Stringer Bell meet with Omar Little to handle Brother Mouzone.

Note: This post contains spoilers for season one, episode seven of “Red Band Society,” entitled “Know Thyself.”
For the first time in seven episodes, I genuinely laughed with the characters on “The Red Band Society” instead of at them. It hurts me to say this, but I actually enjoyed tonight’s episode. While last week left me nervous with the suspension and departure of Nurse Jackson (Octavia Spencer, “The Help”) from Ocean Park Hospital, “Red Band” proved me wrong with the surprisingly unpredictable direction of tonight’s episode. 
As Nurse Jackson sips wine and cooks her worries away at home, the hospital’s atmosphere has dramatically changed with her absence. No one is happy with Dr. McAndrew (Dave Annable, “Brothers &Sisters”) for suspending everyone’s favorite nurse. She kept the place running smoothly with her no-nonsense attitude and efficiency. People seem to forget she broke the law by writing Charlie’s (Gluck, “Private Practice”) name on a healthy blood sample. I’m willing to forget this small technicality too if that means Spencer stays on the show. 
Emma (Ciara Bravo, “Big Time Rush”) and Leo’s (Charlie Rowe, “Neverland”) relationship takes an important step when two of Leo’s old friends come to visit him in the hospital and the foursome go out to lunch. It was going just fine, until Emma’s turn to order came. After not ordering any food, Leo’s friend berates and interrogates Emma about her eating disorder. The remarks become pretty harsh as Emma’s anorexia is soon associated with suicide. I actually felt angry and sad for Emma during this attack. What’s happening to me? This show actually made me feel real emotions. 
Even though the new guy, Hunter (Daren Kagasoff, “The Secret Life of the American Teenager”) incessantly makes fun of the regular gang, he hangs out with them anyway. In fact, this week Hunter brings the crew to the emergency room to secretly watch a surgery. Somehow he acquired an ID card that only doctors have. Although this doesn’t seem plausible, one can’t undermine the skills of this mysterious toothpick-chewer just yet. 
As for the end of the episode? Charlie’s eyes open. The show has gripped me for the first time all season, and I’m not sure how I feel about it. 
Observations/things worth chuckling about:
*We learn about Nurse Jackson’s former career as a professional background singer and if that isn’t delightful enough, she sings, “Midnight Train to Georgia” by Gladys Knight,”  in a smoky jazz lounge! Add singing to Spencer’s long list of talents. 
*Like every other mature adult, I love a good period joke. Kara (Zoe Levin, “Palo Alto”) had me laughing after answering “You’re late!” with “That’s what I said to my period last month.” Stupid, I know.
