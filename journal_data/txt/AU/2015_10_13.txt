A history theme is the name of the game this week. I have always been a history nerd, and could never understand how some people don’t find it interesting: it is all stories of intrigue, love, violence, sex, friendship, loyalty, drama, and betrayal. But though history classes may not be everyone’s cup of tea, historical (fiction and nonfiction) shows and movies are worth a look. To give you all a little taste of the great period shows and films on Netflix, I have picked a few of my favorites. 
1. Ripper Street, 2012-2013

Based loosely on the Jack the Ripper killings, “Ripper Street” follows two London detectives as they solve murders during the height of Ripper hysteria. The show takes its time revealing the backstories of its characters, and usually discusses these stories in very creative ways that tie in to the murder they are solving that episode. Furthermore, characters come from different classes and even countries, making for a diverse group of people, as well as interesting relationships and dynamics. If you like the time period and basic structure of “Sherlock Holmes,” this show is right up your alley. 

2. Copper, 2012-2013

Set in New York City in 1865, “Copper” explores many difficult issues such as racism, war, death, friendship, politics, class, loyalty and love. A detective, with the help of his friends, solves crimes and gets wrapped up in his own criminal activity as well. The show is very intriguing because it addresses and examines class structure and disparity in 1860s New York through the lives of the characters. Furthermore, with the main characters all being Civil War veterans, the viewer gets an inside look at how those people coped with their war experiences and trauma (something that is most often left out of the history textbooks). For anyone interested in the Civil War, race and class dynamics and/or a good mystery, “Copper” is worth a try.
3. Inglourious Basterds, 2009

Although a very popular and well known movie, I still thought it was a necessary addition to the list. Unlike the other shows and films on this list, “Inglourious Basterds” is a comedy, albeit a dark one, and also gives a slightly different perspective and tone to WWII. Perhaps strange and brutal at times, the movie will (hopefully) make you laugh, as well as give you a view of World War II that is not from the battlefield. With a stellar cast of Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Diane Kruger, and directed by Quentin Tarantino, it is definitely worth your time to see, if you haven’t already. 
4. Lawless, 2012

Taking place in Virginia during the Prohibition/Great Depression, “Lawless” is the story of the Bondurant brothers and their bootlegging business and adventures. This film is a strange blend of serious and realistic, and over-the-top and larger than life. Although based on a true story, some aspects of it have certainly been exaggerated. But with a strong cast starring Tom Hardy, Jessica Chastain and Shia LeBeouf, it’s definitely a fun adventure and worth watching. 
5. Peaky Blinders

Set in England in the early 1900s, this show focuses on the famous gang, Peaky Blinders. A blend of gangster violence, brotherhood, and love, “Peaky Blinders” makes for a very intriguing show, and gives the viewer an inside look into the lives of the gang members and the workings of the gang. Furthermore, since the show takes place in England, you get to see how English gangs compare to those of America. So if you like human interest stories, gangs, crime mysteries/stories, and relationships both romantic and platonic, give this show a shot. 
So, for all you history lovers out there (or those looking to get a taste of historical films and tv shows), check out these titles, and I hope you enjoy!

Concertgoers wound around the block at the 9:30 Club, waiting in line for Mew’s headlining show on Oct. 9. The Danish pop-rock band, usually found playing to massive European audiences, packed their energy and charisma into a high-octane show that kept 9:30 visitors moving throughout the performance. Eclectic indie-rock duo The Dodos played a brief but stellar opening set showcasing songs from its newest releases, 2015’s “Individ,” and 2013’s “Carrier.”
The Dodos took the stage promptly at 10:30, kicking off the late-night show with pounding drums and percussive guitar in “Goodbyes and Endings,” then launched immediately into “Competition,” a stand-out track from “Individ.” Guitarist Meric Long’s thickly layered guitar parts were supported by drummer Logan Kroeber’s primal, polyrhythmic beats. The duo blazed through their 30-minute set, balancing catchy hooks against densely interwoven rhythm-driven jams. Long’s guitar work in an extended solo on “The Current” left concertgoers - even those solely in attendance for Mew - thoroughly impressed. The short set wrapped up with “Precipitation,”  the driving first track on “Individ.”
After a brief intermission, Mew took the stage one member at a time amidst thunderous applause. The Danish prog-rock outfit, whose sound leans more pop than most profiles indicate, launched into its set with “Witness,” from latest album, “+ -.” Elaborate lighting and impeccable sound engineering emphasized that Mew operates on a level of professionalism not always found in smaller venues. Though better known in its native Europe, Mew’s DC fan base turned out in full, packing the 9:30 Club’s sizable floor to capacity. 
The band’s festival-grade energy coursed through the venue and spilled over into the crowd as Mew continued its set with new songs including “Satellites” and “Water Slides.” Its well-balanced sound perfectly highlighted the members’ individual talents, though Silas Utke Graae Jørgensen (drums) and Mads Wegner (guitar) cut through the mix particularly well. 
Mew charged through its headlining set, delivering rock-steady performances of songs from “+ -,” with a healthy infusion of old favorites. The band kept the energy flowing throughout the dreaded midway point—an often unavoidable trap for even seasoned performers—and hardly stopped to rest between electrifying performances of crowd favorites “Snow Brigade” and “She Spider.” 
The Danish rockers wound down their main set with popular tracks “Am I Wry? No” and “156,” but a deafening call for more brought the group back out. To the audience’s roaring approval, Mew ripped through newer hit “My Complications” and concluded with a soaring rendition of “Comforting Sounds.” Crashing drums and built-up guitars underscored lead singer Jonas Bjerre’s impressively controlled falsetto, ending the night on a literal high note. Mew may not have its largest demographic of listeners here in the U.S., but the dedicated fans that flooded the 9:30 club on Oct. 9 were treated to an outstanding performance that surely won the Danish pop-rockers more than a few new listeners.

“The Blacklist” returned to NBC primetime this week with the new slogan, “It’s good to be wanted.” I’m not so sure if Liz agrees, but it is quite entertaining to watch how she is coping with her newfound “fugitive” status.
Season three picked up quite flawlessly just where season two left off. The usual mild-mannered and disciplined FBI Special Agent Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone) is now number one on the FBI’s most wanted list after shooting Attorney General Tom Connolly, who, in her defense, was not a good guy. Now Red (James Spader) and Liz are on the run, and Special Agent Donald Ressler (Diego Klattenhoff) is out to find them.  
One thing that surprised me about the episode was Liz’s handle on the situation. For someone who just killed the U.S. Attorney General, she did not freak out the way I expected her to. Besides one or two moments of panic, she seemed pretty calm and collected. Maybe that’s just her personality or maybe it’s FBI agent instincts kicking in, but I expected her to explode in a rush of craziness or something, anything.
On another note, I strongly disliked FBI agent Samar Navabi’s role in this episode. I felt like she was more of an annoying, distant, nagging aunt rather than an FBI agent. She spent most of her on-screen time either nagging Ressler about his instincts or whining about whatever it was that came to mind. It was unnecessary. Of course Ressler is screwed up by this whole ordeal. He let Liz escape FBI custody, then she went off and killed the Attorney General. No need to remind him. Let him deal with those issues on his own time. Focus on doing your job please.
Now I would not be doing the episode justice if I did not address the Dembe subplot. All I have to say on this matter is, finally. Dembe is such an amazing character and, in my opinion, sometimes the only voice of reason on this show. To see him in his own element, out of Red’s shadow, is quite spectacular and I am very excited to see where the writers take his plot.
For me, the star of this episode was Liz’s mom, Katarina Rostova. She was a recurring element in the episode. She was mentioned when Liz dyed her hair blonde (I liked it better brunette), when Liz and Red were waiting to escape, and when Red called Liz to tell her she was not going to make it out of D.C. I think it was refreshing to see Red be 100 percent honest and truthful with Liz about her mother for once. Okay, maybe it was 80 percent. But it was better than the half-assed answers that Red usually provides. To see Red be (almost) emotional was refreshing for his character and brilliant acting on James Spader’s part. 
Overall, the episode was, quite truthfully, better than I expected it to be. The writers could have gone in so many directions but I think they handled the situation well and addressed it with their usual dosage of cliffhangers and a new outlook on certain characters and relationships. I look forward to this new season with optimism and my usual giddiness, and quite frankly, I just can’t wait for Tom Keen to come back.

Academic advisers Marianne Norman and Alicia Mandac want to help students change their response to stress and anxiety by incorporating mindfulness into their lives through a new program called Mindful Mondays.
Mindful Mondays are weekly sessions that focus on well-being, self-care and mindfulness. The sessions are tailored to meet the needs of AU students. They include breathing techniques, discussions of mindfulness, meditation, experiential strategies and activities, such as writing thank you cards to express gratitude.
Norman, the director of undergraduate advising for the School of International Service, and Mandac, a senior academic counselor in the College of Arts and Sciences, said they came up with the idea of Mindful Mondays over a meal at Cava.
“We’re in academic advising roles, and so we really get to see students every day, one on one, and we get to see the stress that students are under, the expectations that students set for themselves,” Norman said.
Through Mindful Mondays, Norman and Mandac have created a welcoming, open setting for students to start their week off on a positive note. Their goal is to bring the world of health coaching to students in a way that is easy for them to incorporate into their daily lives.
Lindsay Petelinkar, a freshman in SIS who attended a session, said the Mindful Monday workshop gave her perspective on her life as a student.
“It’s a good way to just get out of the whole University campus setting,” Petelinkar said. “[To] think about yourself and realize that just one test or one essay or one exam isn’t going to ruin your life.”
Being academic advisers and having backgrounds in health advising, both Norman and Mandac bring their prior experience working with students to their Mindful Mondays sessions.
“The perspectives they bring to college impact how they view their college experience, what they want to get out of their college experience, what they think their college experience should be and how that translates to their performance in the classroom…and what kind of community member they are here are AU,” Mandac said.
Mindful Mondays are much broader than just meditation, according to Norman. Each week has a new focus, and every session welcomes drop-ins as well as students who come on a weekly basis.
Sessions are held each Monday from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the Hughes Formal Lounge, and Norman and Mandac will host an extra session on Dec. 9 to assist with the stressors that often emerge during finals week.
This week’s topic is spirituality. More information on Mindful Mondays can be found by emailing norman@american.edu or mandac@american.edu.

As midterm exams close in, students looking for some studying help are in luck: a new policy at Bender Library this semester has added all textbooks costing over $150 to the course reserves lending desk.
The pre-existing policy stated that all books assigned for general education courses are put on reserve, where students may check out the books to complete homework or study for short periods of time. The new expanded policy will ensure that books for any AU course costing more than $150 are available to students, according to Course Reserves Coordinator Donna Femenella.
University Librarian Nancy Davenport first suggested the idea of having more expensive books on reserve in the spring of 2015, Femenella said.  The library compiled a list of all the books used in the 2014-2015 academic year and their prices from the campus bookstore and used this information to track down the titles needed to set Davenport’s plan into action.
“Grad students are benefitting from this new program as well as students taking 300- or 400-level classes,” Femenella said.
The pre-existing policy mostly benefitted new undergraduate students, since they are primarily the ones taking general education classes, she added.
Most books from the course reserves can be loaned for two hours, and there are some that can be taken for a day, based on the recommendations of the professor that reserved the book, according to Femenella.
Students such as School of International Service freshman Crystal Moore feel grateful for the new program but believe that more should be done to make textbooks affordable.
“My Spanish textbook is very expensive when combined with the required access code, and even the campus store does not sell it,” Moore said. “But we need it because we need to do homework which is twenty percent of the grade … I am able to do my homework only because I study with a classmate who has the textbook.”
Moore added that her book is not in the library and said all professors should work with students and do whatever they can to reduce the financial strain expensive books put on students.
According to Executive Director of Communications for the Undergraduate Senate Bélen Bonilla, Student Government recently passed a bill advocating that all professors put their textbooks on reserve starting this spring.
Class of 2018 Senator Dante Bucci, Class of 2016 Senator Josh Zucker, Campus At-Large Senator Jack Stein and Class of 2016 Senator Louis Ryan sponsored the bill, which passed on Sept. 20.
“The bill is advocating that all professors place their books on reserve so that students do not have to suffer,” Bonilla said.

Kiersten Gillette-Pierce speaks at the Senate meeting on Oct. 11. Photo by OWAIN JAMES / THE EAGLE
At a packed meeting on Sunday, the Undergraduate Senate unanimously passed a bill requiring all Student Government office holders to undergo cultural and racial sensitivity training.
The bill, written by Kiersten Gillette-Pierce, a senator for the class of 2016, and co-sponsored by Devontae Torriente, a senator for the Class of 2018, works to combat racial insensitivity on campus.
“This is not revolutionary, this is just necessary,” Gillette-Pierce said on the Senate floor. “Every year I’ve been here, it’s gotten worse … with these trainings, at least we can’t excuse ignorance.”
The legislation is crucial, Gillette-Pierce said, because the Student Conduct Code has no specific policy for dealing with harassment based on race.
The bill outlines a plan for the trainings, which will begin next semester. The program’s success will be monitored with evaluation forms completed before and after the trainings, which SG members will submit to the Comptroller’s office. Officers who fail to comply with the mandate may face disciplinary action from their supervising executives.
Senators, for instance, would be punished by the Speaker. Current Speaker Will Mascaro said that he would either encourage the Senate to consider suspending the senator until they completed the training, or write and sign a legislative order suspending the senator until they complied.
If the program is successful, the creators hope to expand it to include members of other clubs and organizations and, ultimately, the entire campus.
The curriculum for the trainings has not yet been written. Members of the SG Diversity and Inclusion Working Group, AU’s cultural clubs and student-led racial justice movement The Darkening will design the course together, according to Gillette-Pierce.
“We’re starting it with the student leaders because they’re the ones who influence the student body the most, and by having them set the example … it makes it easier to have everyone get on board,” said Aaliyah Lambert, the coordinator of the SG Diversity and Inclusion Working Group.
Although the group has not decided on a format for the trainings, Gillette-Pierce said she envisions something similar to Empower AU, a sexual assault prevention workshop piloted during Welcome Week this year.
When the bill passed, the sizable crowd present gave Gillette-Pierce a standing ovation.Members or supporters of The Darkening made up a large portion of the audience, and the group created a Facebook event encouraging students to come, using the hashtag “#BlackOutSenate.”
The Darkening has had a strong presence at AU since the fall of 2014, when it was started by five female AU students, according to Gordon Edwards, chair of The Darkening’s Student Life Committee.
The movement’s mission is “To establish harmony on campus through fostering an environment conducive to acceptance, cultural sensitivity & love for all people,” according to its Facebook page. Since its inception, The Darkening has organized several well-attended protests and collaborated with Student Government and the Office of Campus Life to plan forums and teach-ins, The Eagle previously reported.
School-wide conversations about race relations and multiculturalism have been scarce, Edwards said. He specifically mentioned racially-offensive posts on Yik Yak, a social media app that allows users to write anonymous comments and view comments from others in the same geographic area. Commenters in the range of AU’s campus used Yik Yak to make racial jokes and post slurs at various times last school year, the Eagle previously reported.
Sunday’s Senate meeting fell just a few days after even more racist posts appeared on the app. Edwards also cited a recent incident in which the “n-word” was written on a whiteboard in freshman dorm Anderson Hall.
“Students get let off for a large majority of their offensive comments,” Edwards said.
Edwards said he sees Gillette-Pierce’s bill as “the beginning of long-term progress.” He is hopeful that the conversations it inspires will help students examine their prejudices.
“There are too many human factors to really say what its success will be, but if students keep talking about it, students keep advocating, and students keep getting involved,” Edwards said. “It will be very successful, regardless of whatever opposition is ahead of us.”

Cranes dot the skyline atop the Reeves Center Building in the U Street neighborhood of Northwest. The area has seen an influx of white residents in the recent decade, along with increased development (Cuneyt Dil/The Eagle).
The District, like several major cities in the U.S., is in the midst of a transition in its racial makeup as more white people are looking for homes in inner-city neighborhoods.
That shift across U.S. cities was at the center of Columbia University professor Lance Freeman’s talk at AU Oct. 6. Freeman, who works for Columbia’s Urban Planning Program, has conducted several interviews and studies — including looking at research from the 1980’s and 90’s. As part of his work, he also looked at dissimilarity indexes, which measure how segregated white residents are from black residents in a given neighborhood.
Freeman said that the trend of white people moving into predominantly black neighborhoods is more apparent in the inner-city neighborhoods of D.C., and in places like Manhattan, Philadelphia and Chicago.
“In D.C. there is a large black middle-class population and sizeable black enclaves. But the whites aren’t necessarily moving into those neighborhoods, they tend to be focusing more close to the central city, less in the outer parts of Washington D.C.,” Freeman said at the talk held by the Metropolitan Policy Center in the School of Public Affairs.
According to Freeman, these neighborhoods now appeal to white people because of several variables, including not being married, increased racial tolerance, lower crime rates, and having children later in life, meaning less need for cars when living in dense urban areas or the need for potentially better suburban schools. 
Freeman also said that there were potential benefits to this trend, called “neighborhood effects,” such as more resources going to schools or better police services.
However, through interviews with longtime residents of neighborhoods going through this demographic transition, Freeman found that there was ambivalence as many fear the possibility of being displaced because they may not be able to afford to live in the area anymore.
“And there was also a lot of cynicism about why the neighborhood all of a sudden was improving. They definitely look at it as though, ‘Well the neighborhood is getting better because whites are moving in,’” Freeman said.
Freeman also argued that there are ways to lessen the impact of this trend, such as promoting affordable homeownership, housing subsidy programs, tax increment financing and housing vouchers.
“There are a number of reasons why this is important just in terms of social justice or equity,” Freeman said. “We want things to be fair for everyone to have a desirable or decent neighborhood.”

	In 1999, the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration placed a moratorium on issuing liquor licenses around Glover Park and Cathedral Heights. The measure prevented any new taverns or nightclubs from opening in the area, and put a cap on liquor licenses issued to restaurants.

	“It was devised to control what was then out-of-control peace, order and quiet issues as a result of ABC (Alcoholic Beverage Control) licensed establishments,” Glover Park Advisory Neighborhood Commission Chair Jackie Blumenthal said.

	Last Thursday, the ANC proposed that the restriction be lifted on restaurant licenses — but not for taverns or nightclubs.

	The ANC has supported loosening the moratorium’s restrictions before; the last three times the city ordinance was up for renewal, the ANC endorsed weakening it. The commission’s current proposal keeps with the trend.

	“We’ll approve continuing the moratorium against taverns and nightclubs, but not against anything else in Glover Park,” Blumenthal said.

	The ANC will vote on their proposal Nov. 12. In the meantime, residents are encouraged to send feedback to commissioners by 
	email.

	If the ANC supports the alterations to the moratorium they will have to present the proposal to the alcoholic beverage regulatory agency.

	“We will appear before ABRA, probably in January, before the Alcohol Beverage Control Board to present our petition and answer their questions,” Blumenthal said.
The vote will be the first step towards a major change for potential restaurants in Glover Park and Cathedral Heights. If approved, it may be a few months before looser regulations take into effect.
