After weeks of outrage, a special prosecutor has charged George Zimmerman with the second degree murder of Trayvon Martin.

Perpetuating hate and injustice
By Derek Siegel
It’s racial profiling. When did your skin color become an indication of guilt? If Zimmerman walks free, it will be an indictment of all young Americans.
It’s a media bloodbath. They’ve been distorting evidence to support the theory that Zimmerman is a racist. Open your eyes—they’re fooling us! 
If Trayvon Martin were white, there’s no way Zimmerman could have gotten away with it. But it’s OK for him to shoot a black man, right?
If black people committed fewer crimes, then there wouldn’t be these stereotypes. 
Zimmerman should die for what he did. 
What’s so special about Trayvon Martin? This sort of thing happens everyday. 
------
Zimmerman has become a scapegoat—and Martin, a martyr—(or vice versa) for something much more profound than a matter of self-defense. There’s something about this case that hits a little closer to home than Casey Anthony or O.J. Simpson ever could. Regardless of the disputed ‘facts’ of the shooting, the situation remains very unsettling. Why? It’s ambiguity. In a country of polarized politics and opinions, everything has its place. You’re either right or wrong; Republican or Democrat; hero or villain. So how are we supposed to reconcile the fact that we can see ourselves as both George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin? 
I am Trayvon Martin. I don’t know what it’s like to be a black man in America. That’s not an identity I claim, and it would be inappropriate for me to speculate. That being said, I have my own experiences with marginalization. As a gay man, I sometimes feel as if I inhabit a world created by somebody else for somebody else; the rules weren’t designed with me in mind. People judge me without knowing me. They hate me without knowing me. I am a target waiting to be found. 
I am George Zimmerman. I didn’t shoot Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was the one with the gun, but he’s not the only one with prejudices. I have prejudices too. Sure, I can play my liberal-acceping-progressive-my-best-friend-is-black card, but that doesn’t change the fact that sometimes I feel uncomfortable or even a little threatened in a group of black people. I would love to think that George Zimmerman and I have absolutely nothing in common, that he’s a malicious, narrow-minded killer. But what if I grew up under different circumstances? What would I do with a gun in my hand, face-to-face with Trayvon Martin one night? 
A seventeen-year-old black man died on February 26, 2012; culprit unknown. It could have been Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman. It could also have been our American culture, guilty for condoning these racial stereotypes and transforming Trayvon Martin into a brutal monster before our very eyes. Each and every one of us, however, could be put on trial. No matter the color of our skin, by not actively challenging these forces, we perpetuate the hate and injustice. What if we all—even those of us who wear our hoodies in solidarity—had a hand in killing Trayvon Martin? Does this thought make you uncomfortable? It should.

Stand your ground
By Aiden Pink
That Florida’s version of the Stand Your Ground exists shows that the Republican Party’s nostalgia knows no bounds. Their abortion and gay marriage policies show they want to live in a 1950s Leave it to Beaver Neverland. Their zeal to eliminate the welfare safety net and effective oversight of Wall Street harkens back to the pre-Depression laissez-faire principles of Herbert Hoover. And recent events have shown that their gun laws take us back to the Wild West.
Just like Communism, Stand Your Ground works in theory, as long as you put yourself in an 1870s mindset. Stand Your Ground essentially means that if a person feels threatened, they have no duty to first attempt to retreat, and are allowed to immediately attack a perceived threat. This works in John Wayne movies, where anyone who has a gun could and would shoot you if you didn’t shoot them first. Of course, at that time, guns were owned by every person and by most horses. This policy isn’t as effective in 2012, when the most dangerous weapon most people carry on them is a set of car keys. 
Florida’s version of Stand Your Ground goes one step further by essentially granting immunity from criminal prosecution for anyone who claims self-defense. This merits repeating: If you shoot someone in the state of Florida and claim self-defense, the case is not even allowed to go to trial. Apparently, Florida lawmakers believe that gun ownership somehow conveys magical properties that prevent people from lying about their motivations for pulling the trigger. How is this OK? Of all of the people to trust, are you really going to believe the person who just shot someone?
I am a firm believer in the presumption of innocence, something that many commentators have apparently forgotten about when discussing the Trayvon Martin case. The last time an alleged race-based crime went viral in a similar manner was the Duke lacrosse case, and the white defendants were eventually fully exonerated. Until we have all the facts, conjecture is pointless. And unless there is a trial, most of the facts will never see the light of day. Unfortunately, due to Florida’s immunity law, it is highly unlikely a trial will occur. Of course, just because there’s a trial doesn’t mean justice will be done—just ask Rodney King. But if George Zimmerman truly killed Trayvon Martin in self-defense, he should have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. We shouldn’t just take him at his word.

•Arrogance, Pessimism, and being Anti-social have helped me find the self confidence I've been missing for a long time. It gets lonely at times, but I truly believe it's worth it in the end when I achieve my life goals. If you feel like deep down your lacking an identity, try seeing the world as against you instead of around you. It may be the motivation you've been searching for. # Darth Vader Advice Column



•sheeeeeebz
•"Not to start a UC war, but the World Politics kids need to get over themselves. Seriously. Enough. No one else on this campus thinks you're cool except yourselves..."  Why do you say this? A select few think this. Not all of them.
•it's this girl...she lives next door to the store that i loiter at... it's this girl... i know that she's the key to love... but the closest that i got was poking her on facebook
•Person whose boyfriend wants to go on a break- story of my life. hang in there babe, everything will be okay. Just know there are other people out there like you
•I think I'm addicted to chapstick
•I see you at TDR every time I'm there. I think you're cute. We should be friends.
•blink 182 lyrics ranter be my best friend please
•@"My life is stressful. I don't know where the hell I fit in. I got my music friends (I play sax), I got..."- Well Im sure Noone understands, best of luck to you both :)
•Everyone has officially figured out who DPAKnows is on twitter... now i'm just bored... and dpanose is just as lame...
•@ What's my age again ranter- I love you. That's one of my favorite songs too (:
•K, so my recently (ex) boyfriend is coming to visit to see if we can work things out. He says he can see us together but this weekend will determine if that happens. What can I do to get him back? Any success stories of things that have worked for you? HELP PLEASE
•@"It makes me so sad to see all the ragging on the Eagle" When I first read this I initially thought it was about  typographic alignment. My bad. #DesignStudentProblems
•@Can we please cite who wrote the poetry at the end? I'm pretty sure ranting without citations is still plagiarism. And if you are writing your own poetry and want to remain anonymous, just sign it "self": Excuse me while I go gag.
•4/20 is right around the corner...i don't know why but that day just speaks to me
•@"I'm a GW Student. An AU friend told me about rants, and I've been reading them for awhile. I have lots of boyfriend issues too. Am I allowed to rant?"
Yay, welcome to the magical world of eagle rants =) I wish I could meet more people from the other DC schools, not that I don't love AU kids but DC could potentially be such an awesome "college town" if there was a lil networking between all of us!
•@"consistent sexual abuse of men". obviously you didn't go to take back the night because you wouldn't be saying the awful things you're say. Male sexual abuse was addressed.
P.S. the whole world is a men's circlejerk. when do women get a turn?
•An LDR support group fo' reals? HUZZAH, HUZZAH! Please notify us when this is official!
•I feel special when I get little Editor's Notes on my rants. :)
[Editor's note: This editor hopes you feel extra special today.]
•Does Editor have facebook? I can't find her there. :(
[Editor's note: Yes, but this editor's privacy settings are pretty strict.]
•@”Multiple studies have proved that women get ~77% of what men make for comparable jobs.” That’s because women CHOOSE to work fewer hours. Please give me one single study that shows that women are being paid less than men when working the same jobs for the same amount of time. This is a non-issue and turns women away from feminist groups that ignore REAL issues facing women.
•@how many young girls say they want to be doctors, astronauts, lawyers, the president?" Actually, There are more women than men in both law schools and med schools. So you may want to check your facts.  Society is NOT ‘keeping women down’ and squashing their dreams. STOP PLAYING VICTIM! I’m a woman law student at AU. I have never encountered anyone telling me I couldn’t be a lawyer bc I’m a women. The fact is women CHOOSE lower paying jobs like teaching and social work more than men because many women ENJOY helping people more than making tons of money.
[Editor's note: This editor just wants to point out that there's a difference between having more women than men enrolled to study a particular subject and the rate of pay those women and men receive.]
•@original cold call ranter...yeah, totally wasn't talking about the same thing you were talking about...I was talking about solicitation calls, and yeah, it was in reference to a professor...sorry..
•UC World Politics hater: I completely agree with you. UC World Politics = so much unjustified ego.
•Why is this so much fun?
•of course the day I am about to buy my ticket to see Say Anything, the concert is sold out. of course
•You 100% did not deserve to get hired for that job and I'm sick of you taking good things away from good people just because you can. Plus, you're tacky and I hate you.
•@You clearly didn't do any research - June O'Neil, formerly of the Congressional Budget Office, found that young women who have never had children make, after controlling for experience and education, 98 percent of what men make. She found that on the whole, there is an  unexplained gap of 8% between what ALL men and women make when controlling for these things. This is far too large of a gap, the gap in a perfect world would be zero - but it is also FAR less than "77 percent," as one ranter said yesterday.
•@Emotional Pain: Music.
•Honey, yo' nose sounds like a donkey blowing a horn. I understand that sometimes you just gotta sniffle, but other times you seriously just gotta BLOW. Please. Tissue yourself.
•Even though you're a million miles away/ when you hear born in the USA/ you relive those glory days/ from so long ago...
•When you don't wash your hands after using the restroom, you make me want to scrub everything. It still surprises me when you shower. (Sidenote, I thought hygiene was covered in elementary school. Why are college kids still not understanding how this soap-water-thing works???)
•My huge craps ain't goin' away.
•ALL OF MY PLANS ARE COMING TRUUUUUUUUUUUEEEEEEEEE <3
now I just need to find the motivation to keep my grades up...
[Editor's note: Congrats!]
•Later on, on the drive home, I called her mom from a pay phone. I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail (the state looks down on sodomy). And that's about the time that B**** HUNG UP ON ME. Nobody likes you when you're TWENTY-THREE and I'm still more amused by pay phone calls. What the hell is call ID? My friends say I should act my age... what's my age again? What's my age again?
•The only forms of human contact I get anymore are punches to the ribcage and kicks to the stomach.  And I'm strangely okay with that.
•woke up spooning a trashcan #mylifeisrobcoy
•I've finally gotten the college experience; this entire year was one crazy whirlwind of an adventure. I'm scared that maybe it was too much of an adventure, and now no one will want to get serious with me. I promise I'm an amazing girl, I just needed my "single" year!
•I.  Hate.  Group.  Projects.  Nothing against my fellow group members, you're all great, I just hate feeling obligated to produce better work since we're all in this together...
•Love who you are.
Because God made you who you are for a reason and trying to be anyone else is an insult to His creation.
•Whoever ranted Springsteen by Eric Church lyrics is my hero. Can we be friends????
•@transfer who can't find friends: I transferred here 4 semesters ago, and although I have a lot of acquaintances, I wouldn't call any of them true friends. Just know you're not alone, this place can be pretty lonely, but maybe we'll bump into one another some day?
•@Desperate Housewives: I DON'T KNOW! DH has been my guilty pleasure for way too long.  I may go back and watch the first few seasons, as I don't really remember them at all.
•@Bullying Club: Tuesday the 17th, 4pm, Mudbox? (Posting this way in advance so you can respond with another time if that's not good.)
•Oh my bad I was completely wrong about how they were edited.
•I stay facebook friends with a girl from high school who I a absolutely hated (because she was mean was so mean to me) just so that I can take pride in knowing that my life is better than hers. And knowing that she peaked in high school gives me happiness. Is this wrong of me?
•Dear Eagle Rants Editor---Grow a pair you pussy
[Editor's note: This editor reads angry Rants all day and runs a business. So already got a pair, but thanks anyway, honey.]
•@”And don't tell me "omg that's a living thing you're talking about"...it's not until it becomes an independent human being living OUTSIDE my body.” Um actually once the baby is viable (ie around 5 months) biology and the supreme court agree that it is NOT ‘just your body’. But it shouldn’t take you 5 months to realize a missed period.
•I was asked why materialism was a bad thing. I was so shocked that I couldn't come up with a coherent answer? What do other ranters think?
•The flowers are AU are so beautiful. Does anyone else take daily nature walks and stop and smell the flowers?
•@ “It's my body now and forever. If there's something growing in me and destroying my body, I'm going to deal with it.” I hope someone as selfish as you never reproduces. I cannot wait to grow and nurture a life inside me. To do prenatal yoga. To read to my unborn baby. And to take care of the LIFE that is inside me. I do not judge those who choose not to have kids. That’s why we have many options for birth control. But to say that a baby living inside you is destroying your body? Wow, just wow.
•Can one be thankful without being religious or spiritual? I say yes but my friend says no because who are they thanking?
•@”Women's Initiative is a joke that they get all of sexual abuse prevention money, and that they have such influence at this school.” I agree. If our tuition money is paying for Women’s Initiative (a branch of student government), then why are Women’s Initiative leadership positions up for student government elections?
•When were hipsters invented and where did they come from? Does anyone know? I don't know any hipsters back where I come from.
•@”If there's something growing in me and destroying my body, I'm going to deal with it.” I always supported the idea that the government should never be able to force anything on people. Therefore, while I abhor the idea of abortion, I abhor even more the idea of an overly intrusive government restricting liberties. But to hear a fellow AU student talk so selfishly about a baby as if it is a cancer is almost more disgusting that the idea of an abortion.
•Editor, Sorry you had to deal with a dozen rule breaking rants on the 11th. It was probably just one really angry person ranting away. Don’t let that day ruin your faith in the eagle rants community.
[Editor's note: It's Ranters like you that keep this editor going!]
•@Tell me that Women's Initiative just promotes what women CAN do when they have an event celebrating the idea that women CAN choose abstinence.” There was an event a few years back about choosing abstinence. Women’s Initiative protested it.
•@”This editor wouldn't want her classmates or friends to refrain from Ranting just because they know she's editing them. Make sense?” No not really. The rants are anonymous, so you wouldn’t know which ones were from your friends anyway. And if you know certain friends well enough to know their writing style, then they probably know you well enough to know that you are the editor even if you don’t publicly release that information.
•that awkward moment when your boyfriend thinks you ranted about him when it was really someone else in the same situation
•To the girl next door who keeps yelling at her boyfriend on the phone every night – please STOP. Sincerely, someone who is trying to study.
•Be converted. Follow the signs
•I have to pee -- but that means packing all my stuff up and taking it too the bathroom only to return minuets later :( On another note, my essay is due in 7 hours and I really haven't started it yet.
•I wish I could spend every night wrapped up in your arms. I shouldn't, (for now anyhow), but you make it so tempting...
•"It's hard to believe this year is almost over...I have 4 weeks to figure out how to pass all my classes."
Amen. I wish the best of luck to you, and I hope I receive the same in return. Just keep looking toward the future, seriously. That's what is getting me by now. Well, that and finally watching Heroes. XD
•@Desperate Housewives fan: I really don't know what I'm going to do. I know that other networks have tried to fill up the Sunday 9pm time slot, but that has been dedicated to DH for the longest time. :[ I don't know where you may want to go from here, but if you want to take a chance with a show in a whole different direction, may I recommend Breaking Bad?
•The last few weeks may be crashing down on my head, but through all the chaos of this, you pull me through it all. We have trudged through so much to get where we are, and while we may struggle with all the obstacles that face us now, I really believe we can make it. Thank you for never losing hope and making me so ridiculously happy again. I love you, rain or shine
•Note for TV characters everywhere: I know it's very dramatic and all, but angrily sliding things off of tables, desks, and other free-standing objects does not usually end well. Just saying. #avoidingworkatallcosts
•there are scary noises in the library at 5am.
•To the beautiful man wearing light blue shorts and dark khaki backpack in the Dav this morning, joking about putting out a fire with the barista... you are delicious, and seem really nice and funny. Even though I'm not brave enough to approach you, please continue to brighten my days by being incredibly sexy in the Dav. Please and thanks.
•See you at Dan Deacon on the 27th!
•I've been so stupid about guys lately that I literally should not be allowed to have a vagina.
•My boyfriend won't even hug me in public.  He claims it's because he hates PDA, but then he hugs all of his friends every time he sees them or says good bye or anything
•To all the stressed ranters, I suggest taking a walk through the neighborhood that is straight past and to the right of SIS.  It's called either rockwood or rookwood--I can never remember.  Either way, it's very peaceful and the fresh air helps.  Some light exercising at the gym with an iPod can work wonders as well.
I propose that instead of bickering back and forth about social issues on eaglerants everybody just post a tip on how to unstress.  Or you know, actually rant.
•Confession: I left AU after my freshman year, but I still read eagle rants religiously. Don't tell anyone ;)
[Editor's note: It'll be our little secret.]
•Aw dang, early morning Eagle Rants were starting to grow on me. But I'm sure the editor is doing her best to get it out and ready for us. :]
[Editor's note: Thanks for understanding, kind Ranter!]

Eagle Rants: June 10, 2013




•Arrogance, Pessimism, and being Anti-social have helped me find the self confidence I've been missing for a long time. It gets lonely at times, but I truly believe it's worth it in the end when I achieve my life goals. If you feel like deep down your lacking an identity, try seeing the world as against you instead of around you. It may be the motivation you've been searching for. # Darth Vader Advice Column
•sheeeeeebz
•"Not to start a UC war, but the World Politics kids need to get over themselves. Seriously. Enough. No one else on this campus thinks you're cool except yourselves..."  Why do you say this? A select few think this. Not all of them.
•it's this girl...she lives next door to the store that i loiter at... it's this girl... i know that she's the key to love... but the closest that i got was poking her on facebook
•Person whose boyfriend wants to go on a break- story of my life. hang in there babe, everything will be okay. Just know there are other people out there like you
•I think I'm addicted to chapstick
•I see you at TDR every time I'm there. I think you're cute. We should be friends.
•blink 182 lyrics ranter be my best friend please
•@"My life is stressful. I don't know where the hell I fit in. I got my music friends (I play sax), I got..."- Well Im sure Noone understands, best of luck to you both :)
•Everyone has officially figured out who DPAKnows is on twitter... now i'm just bored... and dpanose is just as lame...
•@ What's my age again ranter- I love you. That's one of my favorite songs too (:
•K, so my recently (ex) boyfriend is coming to visit to see if we can work things out. He says he can see us together but this weekend will determine if that happens. What can I do to get him back? Any success stories of things that have worked for you? HELP PLEASE
•@"It makes me so sad to see all the ragging on the Eagle" When I first read this I initially thought it was about  typographic alignment. My bad. #DesignStudentProblems
•@Can we please cite who wrote the poetry at the end? I'm pretty sure ranting without citations is still plagiarism. And if you are writing your own poetry and want to remain anonymous, just sign it "self": Excuse me while I go gag.
•4/20 is right around the corner...i don't know why but that day just speaks to me
•@"I'm a GW Student. An AU friend told me about rants, and I've been reading them for awhile. I have lots of boyfriend issues too. Am I allowed to rant?"
Yay, welcome to the magical world of eagle rants =) I wish I could meet more people from the other DC schools, not that I don't love AU kids but DC could potentially be such an awesome "college town" if there was a lil networking between all of us!
•@"consistent sexual abuse of men". obviously you didn't go to take back the night because you wouldn't be saying the awful things you're say. Male sexual abuse was addressed.
P.S. the whole world is a men's circlejerk. when do women get a turn?
•An LDR support group fo' reals? HUZZAH, HUZZAH! Please notify us when this is official!
•I feel special when I get little Editor's Notes on my rants. :)
[Editor's note: This editor hopes you feel extra special today.]
•Does Editor have facebook? I can't find her there. :(
[Editor's note: Yes, but this editor's privacy settings are pretty strict.]
•@”Multiple studies have proved that women get ~77% of what men make for comparable jobs.” That’s because women CHOOSE to work fewer hours. Please give me one single study that shows that women are being paid less than men when working the same jobs for the same amount of time. This is a non-issue and turns women away from feminist groups that ignore REAL issues facing women.
•@how many young girls say they want to be doctors, astronauts, lawyers, the president?" Actually, There are more women than men in both law schools and med schools. So you may want to check your facts.  Society is NOT ‘keeping women down’ and squashing their dreams. STOP PLAYING VICTIM! I’m a woman law student at AU. I have never encountered anyone telling me I couldn’t be a lawyer bc I’m a women. The fact is women CHOOSE lower paying jobs like teaching and social work more than men because many women ENJOY helping people more than making tons of money.
[Editor's note: This editor just wants to point out that there's a difference between having more women than men enrolled to study a particular subject and the rate of pay those women and men receive.]
•@original cold call ranter...yeah, totally wasn't talking about the same thing you were talking about...I was talking about solicitation calls, and yeah, it was in reference to a professor...sorry..
•UC World Politics hater: I completely agree with you. UC World Politics = so much unjustified ego.
•Why is this so much fun?
•of course the day I am about to buy my ticket to see Say Anything, the concert is sold out. of course
•You 100% did not deserve to get hired for that job and I'm sick of you taking good things away from good people just because you can. Plus, you're tacky and I hate you.
•@You clearly didn't do any research - June O'Neil, formerly of the Congressional Budget Office, found that young women who have never had children make, after controlling for experience and education, 98 percent of what men make. She found that on the whole, there is an  unexplained gap of 8% between what ALL men and women make when controlling for these things. This is far too large of a gap, the gap in a perfect world would be zero - but it is also FAR less than "77 percent," as one ranter said yesterday.
•@Emotional Pain: Music.
•Honey, yo' nose sounds like a donkey blowing a horn. I understand that sometimes you just gotta sniffle, but other times you seriously just gotta BLOW. Please. Tissue yourself.
•Even though you're a million miles away/ when you hear born in the USA/ you relive those glory days/ from so long ago...
•When you don't wash your hands after using the restroom, you make me want to scrub everything. It still surprises me when you shower. (Sidenote, I thought hygiene was covered in elementary school. Why are college kids still not understanding how this soap-water-thing works???)
•My huge craps ain't goin' away.
•ALL OF MY PLANS ARE COMING TRUUUUUUUUUUUEEEEEEEEE <3
now I just need to find the motivation to keep my grades up...
[Editor's note: Congrats!]
•Later on, on the drive home, I called her mom from a pay phone. I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail (the state looks down on sodomy). And that's about the time that B**** HUNG UP ON ME. Nobody likes you when you're TWENTY-THREE and I'm still more amused by pay phone calls. What the hell is call ID? My friends say I should act my age... what's my age again? What's my age again?
•The only forms of human contact I get anymore are punches to the ribcage and kicks to the stomach.  And I'm strangely okay with that.
•woke up spooning a trashcan #mylifeisrobcoy
•I've finally gotten the college experience; this entire year was one crazy whirlwind of an adventure. I'm scared that maybe it was too much of an adventure, and now no one will want to get serious with me. I promise I'm an amazing girl, I just needed my "single" year!
•I.  Hate.  Group.  Projects.  Nothing against my fellow group members, you're all great, I just hate feeling obligated to produce better work since we're all in this together...
•Love who you are.
Because God made you who you are for a reason and trying to be anyone else is an insult to His creation.
•Whoever ranted Springsteen by Eric Church lyrics is my hero. Can we be friends????
•@transfer who can't find friends: I transferred here 4 semesters ago, and although I have a lot of acquaintances, I wouldn't call any of them true friends. Just know you're not alone, this place can be pretty lonely, but maybe we'll bump into one another some day?
•@Desperate Housewives: I DON'T KNOW! DH has been my guilty pleasure for way too long.  I may go back and watch the first few seasons, as I don't really remember them at all.
•@Bullying Club: Tuesday the 17th, 4pm, Mudbox? (Posting this way in advance so you can respond with another time if that's not good.)
•Oh my bad I was completely wrong about how they were edited.
•I stay facebook friends with a girl from high school who I a absolutely hated (because she was mean was so mean to me) just so that I can take pride in knowing that my life is better than hers. And knowing that she peaked in high school gives me happiness. Is this wrong of me?
•Dear Eagle Rants Editor---Grow a pair you pussy
[Editor's note: This editor reads angry Rants all day and runs a business. So already got a pair, but thanks anyway, honey.]
•@”And don't tell me "omg that's a living thing you're talking about"...it's not until it becomes an independent human being living OUTSIDE my body.” Um actually once the baby is viable (ie around 5 months) biology and the supreme court agree that it is NOT ‘just your body’. But it shouldn’t take you 5 months to realize a missed period.
•I was asked why materialism was a bad thing. I was so shocked that I couldn't come up with a coherent answer? What do other ranters think?
•The flowers are AU are so beautiful. Does anyone else take daily nature walks and stop and smell the flowers?
•@ “It's my body now and forever. If there's something growing in me and destroying my body, I'm going to deal with it.” I hope someone as selfish as you never reproduces. I cannot wait to grow and nurture a life inside me. To do prenatal yoga. To read to my unborn baby. And to take care of the LIFE that is inside me. I do not judge those who choose not to have kids. That’s why we have many options for birth control. But to say that a baby living inside you is destroying your body? Wow, just wow.
•Can one be thankful without being religious or spiritual? I say yes but my friend says no because who are they thanking?
•@”Women's Initiative is a joke that they get all of sexual abuse prevention money, and that they have such influence at this school.” I agree. If our tuition money is paying for Women’s Initiative (a branch of student government), then why are Women’s Initiative leadership positions up for student government elections?
•When were hipsters invented and where did they come from? Does anyone know? I don't know any hipsters back where I come from.
•@”If there's something growing in me and destroying my body, I'm going to deal with it.” I always supported the idea that the government should never be able to force anything on people. Therefore, while I abhor the idea of abortion, I abhor even more the idea of an overly intrusive government restricting liberties. But to hear a fellow AU student talk so selfishly about a baby as if it is a cancer is almost more disgusting that the idea of an abortion.
•Editor, Sorry you had to deal with a dozen rule breaking rants on the 11th. It was probably just one really angry person ranting away. Don’t let that day ruin your faith in the eagle rants community.
[Editor's note: It's Ranters like you that keep this editor going!]
•@Tell me that Women's Initiative just promotes what women CAN do when they have an event celebrating the idea that women CAN choose abstinence.” There was an event a few years back about choosing abstinence. Women’s Initiative protested it.
•@”This editor wouldn't want her classmates or friends to refrain from Ranting just because they know she's editing them. Make sense?” No not really. The rants are anonymous, so you wouldn’t know which ones were from your friends anyway. And if you know certain friends well enough to know their writing style, then they probably know you well enough to know that you are the editor even if you don’t publicly release that information.
•that awkward moment when your boyfriend thinks you ranted about him when it was really someone else in the same situation
•To the girl next door who keeps yelling at her boyfriend on the phone every night – please STOP. Sincerely, someone who is trying to study.
•Be converted. Follow the signs
•I have to pee -- but that means packing all my stuff up and taking it too the bathroom only to return minuets later :( On another note, my essay is due in 7 hours and I really haven't started it yet.
•I wish I could spend every night wrapped up in your arms. I shouldn't, (for now anyhow), but you make it so tempting...
•"It's hard to believe this year is almost over...I have 4 weeks to figure out how to pass all my classes."
Amen. I wish the best of luck to you, and I hope I receive the same in return. Just keep looking toward the future, seriously. That's what is getting me by now. Well, that and finally watching Heroes. XD
•@Desperate Housewives fan: I really don't know what I'm going to do. I know that other networks have tried to fill up the Sunday 9pm time slot, but that has been dedicated to DH for the longest time. :[ I don't know where you may want to go from here, but if you want to take a chance with a show in a whole different direction, may I recommend Breaking Bad?
•The last few weeks may be crashing down on my head, but through all the chaos of this, you pull me through it all. We have trudged through so much to get where we are, and while we may struggle with all the obstacles that face us now, I really believe we can make it. Thank you for never losing hope and making me so ridiculously happy again. I love you, rain or shine
•Note for TV characters everywhere: I know it's very dramatic and all, but angrily sliding things off of tables, desks, and other free-standing objects does not usually end well. Just saying. #avoidingworkatallcosts
•there are scary noises in the library at 5am.
•To the beautiful man wearing light blue shorts and dark khaki backpack in the Dav this morning, joking about putting out a fire with the barista... you are delicious, and seem really nice and funny. Even though I'm not brave enough to approach you, please continue to brighten my days by being incredibly sexy in the Dav. Please and thanks.
•See you at Dan Deacon on the 27th!
•I've been so stupid about guys lately that I literally should not be allowed to have a vagina.
•My boyfriend won't even hug me in public.  He claims it's because he hates PDA, but then he hugs all of his friends every time he sees them or says good bye or anything
