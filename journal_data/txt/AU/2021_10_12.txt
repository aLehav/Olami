The following piece is satire and should not be misconstrued for actual reporting. Any resemblance to a student, staff or faculty member is coincidental.
This year’s display of sticky note messages on the inside of residence hall windows lacked the pizazz students had come to expect from their peers.
The messages, made out of hundreds of individual sticky notes, reflected a steep decline from previous years in terms of quantity, variety, and creativity, according to students familiar with the situation.
“During the Democratic primaries in 2020, everyone would spell out which candidate they were supporting,” junior Linda Estrada said. “Now it’s like a heart here, a smiley face there. How are we supposed to keep up our reputation as one of the most liberal colleges in the country with those sort of amateur tactics?”
Only 30 percent of this year’s sticky note designs have anything to do with electoral politics, according to an Eagle tally — an all-time low for the University. 
Another point of contention among students concerned is the perception that fewer students care about decorating their windows this year. 
“I remember in my freshman year someone organized the whole fifth floor of Letts to spell out a sentence going down the line of windows,” senior Delia Mathis said. “Now the freshmen claim they have more important things to do like studying for class. Give me a break!”
Students are not the only ones impacted by this trend.
“I’m really miffed that students aren’t taking their window decorations seriously,” said Celia Bennett, director of undergraduate admissions. “A robust sticky note display on the residence hall windows can help us entice prospective parents. It shows them that AU kids don’t have enough time to drink and carouse if they’re designing, planning and arranging intricate sticky note designs on their windows.” 
Students reported a conspiracy theory circulating, which implicates disgruntled George Washington University students in the demise of AU’s creative sticky note messages on windows. The connection between GWU students and the lack of creativity of AU students remains to be seen.

As alumnae of American University, we are outraged to learn that the administration determined that the graffiti left in a bathroom in Anderson Hall was “possibly” antisemitic, a decision which made national news sites. Two of the three of us are Jewish, the third was a member of a predominantly Jewish sorority. We all came from highly populated Jewish neighborhoods; one of us grew up attending the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, which was the site of the antisemitically-fueled domestic terror attack in 2018. We chose to attend AU because of its status in D.C., it’s culture of inclusiveness, diversity and inquiry, and because the strong Jewish population made it feel like home. 
All three of our families have been impacted by persecution. During our junior year, two of us took “The Holocaust in Film and Literature” with the late Arnost Lustig, a revered professor on campus. He was a Holocaust survivor and wrote extensively on the subject, producing books and films in his native Czech. When we were concerned that another student in our class was making flippant remarks smelling of Holocaust denial, we shared our concerns with Professor Lustig who invited us to teach the last class of the semester on neo-Nazis, Holocaust denial, and the white nationalist movement. What we saw online in 1996 during our research was sickening; I don’t think any of us imagined seeing those images in our beloved halls. And as much as antisemitism has grown in this country in recent years, we never imagined that the University would turn a blind eye to this hatred and characterize it as “possible.” 
Was it possibly a racist hate crime when someone left bananas in nooses around campus several years ago? No. While to some, a graffitied swastika and SS symbolism may not bring the same fear as a noose, to us, it’s a reminder that we are still regarded as “the other,” that few spaces are as safe as we hope and a portent of what is to come. It says that the hatred that killed our relatives is lurking around the corner in a space we always thought and hoped would remain safe. 
AU has always been a beacon of understanding and diversity, a place where no one had to fear who they were or where they came from. Sadly, it seems that things have drastically changed on the campus we love. President Sylvia Burwell and the administration need to reverse course and speak out against hate on campus. AU must stand up to all forms of hate and find its way back to being known as a community that not only welcomes, but also support all its students, or risk losing students, both current and future, to the thought that their safety is dispensable. 
President Burwell, show us the AU that we love. 
Sincerely,
Joanne Davis, AU SPA ’97 (Political science and Jewish studies)
