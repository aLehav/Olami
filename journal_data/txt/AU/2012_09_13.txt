Significant campus and national debate on our coverage of Professor Adrienne Pine’s classroom breast-feeding merits the following statement of fact: 
The Eagle initially started looking into this story when we thought an unknown professor was under administrative review for breast-feeding in class. We then found a number of students who confirmed Pine had breast-fed her baby during a “Sex, Gender and Culture” lecture. 
Heather Mongilio, who has worked at The Eagle as a news reporter for a year, interviewed Pine to confirm the information we had obtained. I subsequently offered Pine anonymity by withholding her name, the class and the school she teaches in.
Had Pine never posted her now well-known essay on CounterPunch, we may have never run a story in the first place. If we had, we would have honored our promise to grant her anonymity.
After Pine’s decision to post her essay, we initially hesitated to communicate with both our readers and mainstream media on a story that had not been published. We could not make the call whether or not to publish until we had all of the facts, and it would have been premature for us to talk about the story in public before the story’s publication.
But national mainstream media could not wait, and The Eagle, Pine and the rest of the AU community have been covered in The Washington Post, NBC and The Huffington Post. 
On Sept. 12, we were able to finish gathering all of the facts we felt were necessary to write an objective news story, found both in our print edition and online. This is the first time we have published a staff-written story on the matter. We used official statements from the University, Pine’s own words on the breast-feeding and her thoughts on her interview with Mongilio (who did not write the final story in order to prevent a conflict of interest), information on the law for public breast-feeding and student reactions. 
However, we did not give Pine enough time to respond to this story in addition to the initial interview. We provided Pine a place for her viewpoint in the story through her post. But that is not sufficient, and for that we apologize. 
We stand by our reporting because this is the essence of journalism: we received a news tip and followed up with the proper sources to confirm the truth. The story, in our eyes, became newsworthy when we found specific policies that afforded her protection, opinions from the University on her actions and widespread campus debate on a very legitimate question on the social acceptance of public breast-feeding.
As a journalist, my preference has always been, and will continue to be, to speak through objective news reports. The Eagle values transparency in its editorial policies and practices, and, now that we have our final story, we can be more open with the steps we took to get to this point. We will continue to follow the Society of Professional Journalists’ Code of Ethics, a national standard for media standards and ethics. We encourage readers to submit letters to the editor with any concerns to edpage@theeagleonline.com.

An AU professor’s breast-feeding during class and a subsequent student newspaper investigation has launched a firestorm of on- and off-campus debate, culminating Tuesday in a student protest at Ward Circle.
Chanting “Give it a rest, it’s just a breast” and holding signs reading “This is not news” and “Feeding your child is normal,” the students said The Eagle was wrong to look into Professor Adrienne Pine breast-feeding her child in class on Aug. 28.
About 15 students gathered at Ward Circle Sept. 11 at approximately 10:30 p.m. in support of Pine and against The Eagle’s potential coverage of her breast-feeding, according to protester Tea Sefer, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences and School of International Studies.
The protest followed days of controversy after Pine, an assistant professor of anthropology in CAS, breast-fed her sick child on the first day of her “Sex, Gender and Culture” course, after which The Eagle began an investigation. This is the first story the newspaper has published on the event.
Through subsequent emails and interviews with newspaper staff, Pine said she believed her breast-feeding was not newsworthy and grew worried that publication would spread her name online in a negative light. 
When Editor-in-Chief Zach Cohen said in an email that the paper planned to run a story, Pine chose to address the issue herself first. In an online essay, she wrote, “[I] decided the only option left was to exposé my breasts – on my own terms – on the internet.”
On Sept. 5, Pine published an article in the online newsletter CounterPunch entitled “The Dialectics of Breastfeeding on Campus: Exposéing My Breasts on the Internet,” in which she criticized The Eagle’s actions. 
“I was shocked and annoyed that this would be considered newsworthy, and at the anti-woman implications inherent in the email’s tone,” Pine wrote of exchanges with Eagle staff writer Heather Mongilio. “Heather continued hounding me … I, unfortunately, was in professor mode, too polite to tell her to go to hell.”
Pine continued, writing that The Eagle is “a sexist third-rate university newspaper” that “has long had a solidly anti-woman slant” and “would craft a poorly-written story … and would shape my online reputation for all eternity.”
The essay also published both Mongilio and Cohen’s cellphone numbers, which were removed upon the University’s request a day later.
News organizations like The Washington Post, Inside Higher Ed and local television affiliates then picked up on the controversy, prompting a larger conversation and the protest on AU’s campus.
AU does not have a policy that specifically addresses breast-feeding on campus but follows D.C. and federal laws, University spokeswoman Camille Lepre said in a statement. D.C. law states that a woman has the “right to breastfeed her child in any location, public or private, where she has the right to be with her child.”
Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, AU is required to give “reasonable break time for an employee to express breast milk for her nursing child for up to 1 year after the child’s birth” and “provide a place shielded from view and from intrusion by coworkers and the public, other than a restroom, where mothers can express milk.”
The University also gives faculty the option of taking leave to care for their sick child, Lepre said.
Pine wrote online that because she could not leave her daughter at day care due to her fever, could not get a baby sitter and did not want to cancel class, she felt her only option was to bring her baby to campus.
The baby grew cranky and hungry during class, prompting the professor to undo two buttons of her shirt and breast-feed her daughter, said School of Public Affairs sophomore Paul Grobman, a student in Pine’s course who was present at the time.
Grobman, who attended the protest, said Pine continued her lecture while no students spoke and the class was not disrupted. The feeding lasted “45 seconds at most” and did not make him feel uncomfortable, he said.
CAS sophomore Jake Carias, a student who was also present during the class, said it was not the breast-feeding itself that bothered him, but that Pine had said during class it would be “unprofessional.”
“Breast-feeding doesn’t faze me,” Carias said. “I have no problems with breast-feeding. It was just to me, the fact that she recognized that it was unprofessional, you know, didn’t even think twice to kind of abuse her power as leader of the classroom.”
“If I thought breast-feeding in class was appalling, her response was even more appalling,” Carias said.
A statement released by the University said AU does not agree with the characterization of students in Pine’s essay.
“The views expressed in the blog were those of the faculty member,” the statement said. “Freedom of expression comes with responsibility, and expressions in fora outside of AU have the potential to affect the educational relationship between faculty and students and effectiveness in the classroom.”
The University declined to comment on individual personnel matters or if Pine had violated guidelines in the Faculty Manual, which says that “the university will take appropriate action for [faculty] ‘misconduct,’” including bullying, discrimination and sexual or discriminatory harassment. 
It also states that faculty “should at all times be accurate, should respect the right of others to express their opinions, and should make every effort to indicate when they are not speaking for the institution.”
Cohen said he stands by his paper’s conduct.
“Heather acted with the utmost professionalism, and I am proud to call her a member of my staff,” Cohen said. 
Pine emailed individual apologies Wednesday night to the reporter and editors involved for publishing their names and contact information online, as well as the tone of her essay.

The room went silent after Eric Reath announced his resignation as Student Government comptroller on Sept. 2, and for good reason.	
Reath was phenomenal at his job.  He has been consistently transparent with information, willing to explain the budget and served as a dedicated student advocate.  Reath was a wonk in the purest form of the word.  If someone had a question concerning the University or SG budget, Reath had the answers.
Reath left for personal reasons and The Eagle feels that this loss cannot be taken lightly.  Reath was going to be the student representative on the AU Budget Committee.  Most students do not fully understand the complexity of AU’s budget.  The budget affects all aspects of the school: the students, the professors, the building initiatives and so on.  Students overall fail to realize how the budget works and exactly where their tuition dollars go.  
These details cannot be learned overnight.  Reath fully understood the intricacies of the AU budget, and that institutional knowledge will be hard to replace.
At the current point in time, it is unclear who will take over the seat on the AU Budget Committee. 
SG President Emily Yu plans to take a more proactive role in budget negotiations now that Reath is out of the game. This will give Yu a chance to fulfill her campaign promises, such as giving students beside incoming freshmen the opportunity to apply for merit-based financial aid.  But with all of the other responsibilities Yu has as SG president, she may not be the most effective advocate for students.  The AU budget can arguably be the most important issue SG handles, and an issue with such precedence should not come second on anyone’s to-do list.
If Joe Ste.Marie, the newly appointed comptroller, takes the seat he would also have a large void to fill.  Ste.Marie and Yu will meet to decide whether or not Ste.Marie will work on the University budget with the Board of Trustees.  Although The Eagle is confident Ste.Marie will be able to handle the new position, he does not have as strong of a financial background as Reath did.  We fear that without Reath’s knowledge the student presence on the AU Budget Committee will not be as influential.    
 We trust the SG officials, but we hope they focus on educating Reath’s replacements in the weeks to come.
 Our main concern is what’s going to happen now.  A strong SG advocate has just been lost, and how SG handles this loss will demonstrate its capabilities to the student body. ? E

The Bánh mì was impeccable: crunchy daikon, savory beef and sweet plus acidic chili-lime mayo combined to create something that was magically foreign, but comfortably local. On a hot Friday afternoon, Navy Yard filled with four-wheeled ambassadors. My tongue could travel halfway across the world with 10 steps to my left or to my right, and it was easy to get lost amongst the tacos, hoagies, gelati, empanadas and curries at Truckeroo.
Beyond the smells, tastes and sounds of orders being yelled to truck-based culinary conductors, there is a history. Bánh mì dates back to French colonial involvement in Vietnam (then Indochina) in the 19th century. Combining the distinctively French baguette with rice-powder and Vietnamese meats, sauces and sides led to the birth of a sandwich that fused two cultures from opposite sides of the world, the result of a colonial empire.
Natives of D.C. will rave about the vibrant Ethiopian food, and many have sampled wot, injera or tibs. Yet, rarely is the question asked why D.C. has the largest Ethiopian population in the United States. The answer is rooted in the USSR-supported, Ethiopian Marxist movement of the 1970s. However, the story goes beyond Cold War politics: during the diaspora of the 1970s, Ethiopians settled in areas of D.C. like Adams Morgan and U Street, which were neglected and feared after the race riots of the 1960s. The immigrant population reinvigorated these neighborhoods and helped transform them into modern-day hotspots. 
This past week launched the Diplomatic Culinary Partnership, a joint effort between the U.S. State Department and the James Beard Foundation. Eighty chefs were given the designation of State Chefs as part of the American Chef Corps (some familiar names might be Mike Isabella, Rick Bayless and José Andrés). This partnership acknowledges the importance of food in understanding and connecting the world. The culinary 21st century has been defined by a recognition and admiration of local, ethnic and cultural foods. Never before have unique food cultures been embraced so openly by writers, critics, TV personalities and food blogs.
Food as diplomacy recognizes that the way to a person’s heart is through their stomach. Culinary ambassadors can connect the United States with individual from around the world through what is perhaps the oldest diplomatic tool. Food is universal, but also something that is unique to different countries, ethnic groups and religions. Understanding a culture’s food is essential to understanding the culture as a whole.
Food is more than just Yelp! reviews or Instagram photos. Food in D.C. is defined by not just cross-cultural collaboration and Americanization, but also ethnic independence. Culinary ambassadors are the first steps in understanding the world beyond GDP, political brinksmanship and the basic theories of international relations. The story behind the food, the story that connects us to different cultures, is almost as amazing as the sweet, spicy and savory Bánh mì at Truckeroo on a hot Friday afternoon.

Why should you care about me? I’m sitting in MGC, bent over my computer.  So what? You walk past me without notice. You don’t care. You’re standing in front of the stairs, waiting for a friend, flipping idly through your phone, pretending I don’t exist. 
It’s something we often do: search for friends within a crowd, glazing over any unfamiliar faces. If we recognize somebody—aha! —we immediately associate them with a name, a personality and a history.  If not, they’re just an indistinguishable blur. 
The way we persistently overlook others sends the message that they aren’t important. When you walk past me in MGC, it’s like you have no use for me. I’m just some boy clacking away on his keyboard, right?
That’s not how a community works. Even if you and I have nothing in common, we have a real impact on one another. As AU students, we do not exist in isolation. We attend classes and events, affiliate with teams and organizations, interact interpersonally and constantly shape our campus discourse through social media. My decisions affect you, even if you don’t realize it. We are interconnected. 
I’ve come to understand, however, that recognizing this interconnectedness isn’t enough. 
Many of us have been taught to be fiercely independent and so we put up barriers. This makes us apathetic to those we don’t immediately perceive as important. In order to overcome these barriers, we must have empathy. We must forge links, not walls, within the AU community.
When do we start to care about somebody? We care when we see ourselves in them. Empathy means figuring out what you have in common with somebody else. Once you share this bond, you are no longer strangers. You cannot ignore somebody who reminds you of yourself. 
Empathy doesn’t require you to introduce yourself to everyone you meet, searching for that thing that you may have in common. Sometimes this commonality can be as simple as both being AU students, both outside enjoying the beautiful weather, or that you’re both in a rush. 
It’s essential to recognize that we are interconnected. I’m reminded of how in the movie Avatar, the Na’vi would greet each other by saying “I see you.” It shows that they acknowledge one another’s significance and complexity. 
If we show apathy by deliberately overlooking one another, we demonstrate empathy when we choose to “see.” If I’m sitting in MGC, you don’t need to talk to me, smile at me or even look at me. But by “seeing” me, you acknowledge that I am an individual who is important to our community, not just a piece of scenery.

Kelly McCaddin led the AU volleyball team to a clean sweep at the Spartan-Aggie Invitational in Greensboro, N.C. 
The sophomore outside hitter earned MVP honors at the event, signaling the step up she has taken since last year.
“She was a force on the right [side] this weekend,” AU head coach Barry Goldberg said. “She played a position she was more comfortable with [and] I think that helped her. It was a big weekend for us for sure.”
The Eagles (5-3) swept both North Carolina A&T (0-12) Sept. 7 and UNC Asheville Sept. 8 in their first two matches. They then capped the weekend by defeating UNC Greensboro Saturday night in a five-set thriller on their way to the tournament championship. 
Freshman libero Allison Cappellino and sophomore outside hitter/middle blocker Sara Rishell joined McCaddin on the All-Tournament Team.
McCaddin’s impressive hitting percentage was one of the top stories of the weekend, including her .571 mark off eight kills and zero errors in the UNC Asheville (4-8) match. She also hit .294, just .001 behind Rishell’s team-best .295 mark, against UNC Greensboro (4-3) off 15 kills and five errors.
“[McCaddin] played great over the weekend,” said Rishell, who recorded a team-best 31 kills during the tournament. “She was just putting balls away. When she’s up there with an open net, no one is going to stop her. No one can dig her when she’s up, and no one will block her. She did really, really well.”
Two things McCaddin improved  this season are her versatility and ball handling, which has made her a significant threat on the right side. She has also seen more opportunities after being either sick or hurt during the first month of the season in 2011.
“She’s improving,” Goldberg said. “She doesn’t miss a lot of balls off her hand, she hits the ball fairly cleanly off the hand. When she goes after it pretty strong, she’s one of our most successful attackers. I think overall, her role is increasing and she’s worked at it for it to increase.”
McCaddin has continued to ride her hot streak from the end of last year, when she hit a team-best .526 in AU’s four-set loss to Delaware in the NCAA Tournament.
As she keeps improving, her potential seems to be limitless. Even though she has already made impressive strides, Goldberg thinks she could have a big future ahead of her. 
“The only question now is how quickly she can increase to the level where she’s a nationally elite player,” Goldberg said. “She definitely has the potential to have a career beyond the college level, so the question is: can she play at the level now while she’s still in college?”

Student Government Sen. Brett Atanasio presented a constitution for the new student government during the Senate meeting on Sept. 2. 
This is the next step in replacing SG with the new AU Student Association.
SG members called for a new constitution because they felt SG had shifted its focus away from advocacy. The Senate voted on April 24 to begin reorganizing SG, The Eagle previously reported. 
The new Student Association would consist of a Board of Representatives, which will replace the current senate. Under the Board of Representatives will be the president. Below the president will be four vice presidents for advocacy, programming, finance and communications, according to the proposed constitution obtained by The Eagle.
The school councils will be removed from the Student Association, according to the documents. 
Instead, the school councils will work with the deans, according to committee member and Senator At-Large Joe Wisniewski. 
The class councils will be replaced in part by a Senior Programming Board.  The vice president of programming will elect members from the graduating class to the board, according to the documents. None of the other classes will have their own organization in the Student Association.
The committee chose  not to include the other class councils, because many of the councils do not become active until senior year, when they focus on raising money for the senior class gift, Wisniewski said.
“It’s a more efficient system,” Wisniewski said.
SG will now work to gain the 600 students’ signatures needed to call for a referendum, the first step toward the special election needed to approve the constitution, Wisniewski said.  
The transition to the new Student Association will be completed by the spring if students approve the constitution, said Atanasio, chairman of the Government Committee on Constitutional Review.
“Personally, I think that this is going to make the organization better,” Wisniewski said. “We desperately need this.”

AU field hockey is flying high after going 2-0 on the weekend at the Terrapin Invitational in College Park, Md. 
The Eagles earned a 2-1 double-overtime win against No. 19 Massachusetts, along with a 3-0 win over Dartmouth.
After a disappointing 0-4 start to the year, AU came out firing against Dartmouth (1-3) Sept. 8. 
Alex McMackin knocked in the game’s first goal before Carly Atchison put the Eagles up 2-0 with her first goal of the season. 
Later in the game, McMackin notched her second goal of the game off an assist from Kati Rothenhoefer to put AU up 3-0. 
Ashley Dalisera played the entire game between the pipes, turning away all four shots on goal. 
The Eagles defense soared to another spectacular performance against UMass Sept. 9, and Dalisera shined with 14 saves.
AU struck first, with Jaclyn Anspach scoring at the 5:44 mark.  
But after the Eagles took a quick 1-0 lead, both offenses went dormant for over 50 minutes. UMass (3-3) eventually tied the game up on a deflection off a penalty corner with just over ten minutes left in regulation, and the game went to overtime tied at 1-1.
The Minutewomen had the best opportunities in the first overtime period, but they were unable to convert on either of their two penalty corner chances. 
UMass put a total of four shots on goal in both overtime periods, and Dalisera was there to shut the door all four times. 
The Eagles managed only one shot in that same time frame, but that was all they needed.  
Shelly Montgomery recorded the game winner in the 92nd minute, giving AU its first overtime victory on the season. 
Despite the successful weekend, a troubling trend has emerged after AU’s first six games. The Eagles are being badly outshot by their opponents. 
On the season, AU’s opponents have held an 89-44 advantage in shots over the Eagles. That must change going forward with the Eagles scheduled to take on No. 19 Michigan State Sept. 14 in East Lansing, Mich.

Florence and the Machine will be continuing her “Ceremonials” tour next week at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Md. The English indie band released their first album, “Lungs,” in 2009 that debuted at the number two spot on the U.K Album Charts, with its second album, “Ceremonials” debuting at number one in the U.K.
The band’s sound is a mixture of indie rock, folk and soul. Welch’s deep, trilling vocals combine with an assortment of instruments to produce dark, powerful, moving music. 
The first single to reach America, “The Dog Days Are Over,” exemplifies the band’s unique sound. Welch’s belting, soulful vocals accompanied with clapping and piano create a catchy, feel-good song. Other songs to listen for include “Shake It Out,” “Cosmic Love” and “What the Water Gave Me.”
Welch is known for over-the-top fashion sense as much as her belting vocals, so concertgoers should expect Welch in a sparkly, dramatic getup.
English indie rockers the Maccabees will open for Florence, known for lead singer Orlando Week’s haunting vocals on “Ayla,” “Pelican” and “Went Away.” While the band’s new album “Given to the Wild” is a darker sound for the band, their songs still have an upbeat tempo.
Tickets are still being sold for $40 to $55. Doors will open at 5:30 p.m. on Sept. 19, but plan to arrive early due to the show’s high demand.  The Merriweather Post Pavilion is located around an hour and a half outside of D.C.

Living in a big city can be expensive. But it doesn’t have to be. Every week there’s someone willing to feed, entertain, occupy, educate or annoy you, all for free. Fine Art For Free rounds up the best free art events in the coming week to help you stretch that paycheck just a little bit further.
Polly Townsend: "Slower Than This"
Flashpoint Gallery | Exhibition closes Sept. 13 at 6 P.M.
If you can make it before 6 p.m. on Thursday, British visual artist Polly Townsend’s latest exhibition will still be on display at Flashpoint Gallery in Metro Center. “Slower Than This” is a more introspective project for Townsend, which focuses on the interplay between photography and painting. Flashpoint Gallery is a fairly small place, so this won’t be a day trip. But if you’re looking for something to do on Thursday but also want to save money for dinner, this exhibit is worth a stop.

 Inspirations from Berlin for Washington's Dupont Underground | Goethe Institut | Opening Discussion and Reception Spet. 13 | Panel Discussion Sept. 14 | Exhibition runs until Nov. 2
Does Washington, D.C.’s future lie in Berlin’s past? Curator Stephanie Sherman thinks so. Her new exhibition, which opens at the Goethe Institut on Sept. 13, examines the ways that the city of Berlin transformed unused or abandoned space into the artistic centers. These centers have helped cement Berlin’s reputation as one of the most creative and interesting cities in the world. The project focuses on the work of a group of Washington artists and researchers who traveled to Berlin seeking inspiration for D.C.’s Dupont Underground project, which aims to create a Berlin-like creative space in abandoned tunnels under Dupont Circle.
Arie Mandelbaum: "Love & Rage" / Katherine Tzu-Lan Mann: "Unquiet Kingdom"
Honfleur Gallery | Opening Sept. 14 at 7 P.M.
Anacostia’s Honfleur Gallery will be celebrating the opening of two new exhibitions Sept. 14, both of which will run until Oct. 26. The first, Arie Mandelbaum’s “Love & Rage,” is a series of abstract, mixed-media works inspired by a six-week residency in Anacostia. The 13 pieces in the exhibition recount experiences from Mandelbaum’s residency in his signature soft, pastel style. Upstairs, Katherine Tzu-Lan Mann’s “Unquiet Kingdom” will open, featuring site-specific, acrylic-on-paper installation paintings which play on the contrast between order and chaos. Each of the paintings feature a clash between tight, intricate patterns and larger, more chaotic marks.

The Office of Information Technology reported 212 AU students were suspected of downloading files illegally or infringing on copyrights through peer-to-peer file sharing during the 2011-2012 academic year.
Student Conduct instructed students to remove the file sharing software.
“The Student Conduct office processed seven complaints for alleged second offenses,” said Rosie McSweeney, director of student conduct and conflict resolution services in an email. 
However, McSweeney could not be reached in time for publication to clarify if the seven complaints resulted in severe consequences.
A warning is the only consequence given after a student is first found to have shared files illegally, McSweeney said in an email. However, students can be subject to more severe consequences such as removal from housing or suspension if there are additional violations.
Student conduct violations are not something students should take lightly, McSweeney said in an email. Student Conduct keeps records of all violations for up to seven years after the date of the violation.
Additionally, “suspension and dismissal files are maintained permanently and released to third parties permanently,” she said.
Student Conduct sent an email to all AU students on Aug. 28 about AU’s current policy on peer-to-peer file sharing.
“AU respects the rights of copyright owners...and is committed to implementing procedures and policies to support their rights without infringing on legal use of those materials by individuals,” the email stated.
AU allows students to borrow music CDs or movies at the AU Bender Library Media Center or the Katzen Music Library free of charge.
Punishment for illegal downloading does not only affect AU students. Boston University graduate Joel Tenenbaum was fined $675,000 for downloading two dozen songs through file sharing in 2009, according to an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education. 
The U.S. Supreme court declined to hear the BU graduate’s appeal in May 2012.
BBC News reported monitoring firms can watch what students download when they are on a university’s wireless network, according to a Birmingham University study.
“An illegal file-sharer downloading popular content would be logged by a monitoring firm within three hours,” the BBC article said.
What the logs could be used for remains unclear, Tom Chothia a Birmingham University professor told BBC.

Two new exhibits at the Katzen Arts Center, “John Cage’s STEPS: A Composition for a Painting, Selected Watercolors, Various Objects, and Ephemera” and “Occupy This!” defy conventional standards of art.
The exhibits opened Sept. 1. Both exhibits deal with the problem of inaction and recall the volatile nature of the 1960s.
Documenting the Occupy Movement
“Occupy This!” incorporates photography, film and art from the Occupy movement around the world, with a focus on Occupy D.C.
The exhibit features a loose reconstruction of the original “People’s Library,” a collection of books and knowledge for Occupy D.C. participants to share. The library adds an aspect of interactivity to the exhibit. Museum visitors are welcome to contribute to and borrow from the makeshift library. The library seems to have a voice of its own, decrying injustice through the  signs that surround it.
The exhibit also focuses on the historical movements that inspired Occupy. “Occupy This!” includes a collection of photographs and a documentary featuring the Bonus Army, a group of World War I veterans that marched on D.C. following the start of the Great Depression to demand full reimbursement of their salaries.
The exhibit as a whole is fascinating because the movement and the events that it depicts  hit close to home. 
Photographs of social movements from the past century recall the appearance of Occupy. 
“Movements look the way they do because of images that have come out of the culture,” said AU Museum Director and Curator Jack Rasmussen during a tour of the exhibits.
Celebrating John Cage
“John Cage’s STEPS” celebrates famed composer, artist and writer John Cage. Cage is most famous for his musical composition “4’33’’,” which is four minutes and 33 seconds of silence. It allows listeners to “experience everything [they] wouldn’t normally hear,” Rasmussen said. This mentality drives the exhibit. 
The exhibit is part of the John Cage Centennial Festival in D.C. The Cage exhibits also include pieces by choreographer Merce Cunningham, which use motion as an unexpected medium. Cunningham used a wheelchair as a paintbrush in one work while footprints decorate another. The pieces vibrate with the chaotic movements used to create them. The works are at once intentional and spontaneous.
Cage’s simple works have a musical quality, reflecting his background. The abstractions in his works seem improvised and in some cases incomplete. These qualities force the viewer to reflect on the artist’s intentions.
“In a way, [Cage] was just as subversive of the institution as Occupy,” Rasmussen said.
More to Come
On Sept. 15, two more exhibits, “Revelation: Major Paintings” by Jules Olitski and “PLATFORMS” by the Washington Sculpture Group, will open at the museum. In the spirit of Occupy, students will host a gallery talk addressing the issue of student debt on the same day.
The exhibits are an effort by the museum to motivate students to get involved, Rasmussen said. 
Rasmussen was interested in creating a show “that was about more than just looking at pictures.”
The show certainly succeeds in this respect. “John Cage’s STEPS” and “Occupy This!” are thought-provoking, multi-faceted exhibits that will prove especially fascinating to museum-goers interested in history. 
The exhibits are open through Oct. 21.

Fans of “The Office” may not know who actress Mindy Kaling is, but they certainly know who her character Kelly Kapoor is. Kaling, who has written for and starred in “The Office,” may finally gain the recognition she deserves with “The Mindy Project.”
With a New York Times bestseller under her belt (“Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?”) and recognition as a comedian, producer and actress it seems logical for Kaling to create her own show.
“The Mindy Project” centers on Dr. Lahiri, played by Kaling, an OB/GYN with a penchant for romantic comedies and bad decisions. Although she makes poor decisions in love, she is a star in the operating room.
“The Office” fanatics should be excited to see the same sarcastic, girly yet ironic humor play out in “The Mindy Project.” Kaling is a refreshing change from the white-washed female leads of network comedy shows before her.
Debuts Sept. 25 at 9:30 p.m. on FOX

Fashionistas of the DMV region swarmed M Street, eager to see what The District shops had in store for D.C.’s Fashion’s Night Out on Sept. 6. 
The whole concept behind FNO is shopping for a cause, with the night’s profits going towards various charities. Proceeds from the signature FNO Georgetown items went toward the Vital Voices Global Partnership, a D.C.-based charity represented by extraordinary women across the globe.
Following this example, stores like J. Crew sold exclusive FNO items. A portion of the funds from J. Crew’s FNO t-shirt benefitted the AIDS Foundation in New York City.
For the most part, stores in the vicinity offered edible freebies and exclusive discounts. UGG Australia had one of the best set-ups, treating customers to an assortment of tasty appetizers with music provided by a DJ. 
Madewell provided their guests with multiple perks, such as beverages, candy and a hair-braiding bar. In addition, customers received free Madewell pouches if they spent over $100.
Urban Outfitters on M Street hosted a local pop-up shop where shoppers could check out local artists and participate in a free DIY workshop for the items that they purchased. Down the street, Anthropologie offered one-on-one styling and extended shopping after hours.
From Q Street to Wisconsin Avenue, pedi-cabs (bicycle chariots) chauffeured shoppers throughout the evening for free. A VIP lounge, built around Dean and Deluca by the nightlife and culture web magazine Brightest Young Things, treated all to red carpet access, free bottles of Vitamin Water and entertainment such as people covered in balloons walking the streets on stilts. Hidden within a white tent behind the PNC Bank on M Street, a DJ played all the mixes on a humongous and empty dance floor.
With freelance photographers waiting on every corner of M Street to snap photos of impressively dressed passers, everyone could feel important no matter who they were or where they came from that night.
While some may be under the impression that there would be no comparison between D.C.’s FNO to that of New York, the evening was a fashionably fun time for all who attended.

At some point, every concertgoer laces up their boots in preparation for facing the infamous “mosh pit.” For the scarce amount of people out there who have never been exposed to a mosh pit, it is essentially the rowdiest section of a crowd where arms, fists and kicks are thrown in all directions. In the aftermath, expect blood, sweat and tears to be shed as well.
Nobody usually enjoys their first mosh pit because they lack experience. (Warning: The worst that could possibly happen is being surrounded by pre-teen fangirls who claw at anyone separating them from their favorite band member.) The nature of surviving a mosh pit is simple: when push comes to shove, reciprocate it all.
If someone gets knocked down, they have a choice—stay down or get back up. This same idea can be applied to everyday life. When we are faced with a challenge, we have the decision to give up and accept defeat or go in knowing it will be difficult, tackle it hands-on and conquer the beast.
My favorite part about the mosh pit is the unexpected kindness conveyed amidst all the chaos. The same people who want to tear their victims apart limb from limb will bend over backwards and support them in the event that they get hurt or need protection. If the pit becomes too intense, there is always the option of getting out, and people will open a path towards the nearest exit. Beyond the venue, this support system is a representation of family and friends. No matter how rough things get inside and outside of the pit, there will always be people who step up and offer a shoulder to cry on or a reassuring hug when it is needed the most. These same people also provide guidance free of charge.
In a way, going into a mosh pit is like a rite of passage. Sticking it out proves how dedicated you are to the band and, above all else, the music. Everyone is equal in the pit; there are no advantages, cheat codes or free passes. It’s one thing to stand on the outskirts and tolerate moshing but quite another to participate for the thrill of defending yourself at all costs, and in the process earning some respect.
There’s something educational about being in a crowd full of strangers at a venue for one night that completely triumphs what I am forced to learn out of a textbook in a classroom every day. The people of the pit teach me more about life in one night than my professors manage to do in one week.
Then again, maybe I am speaking total nonsense because I have been hit in the head too many times by random crowd-surfers.

Mount Eerie’s sixth LP delivers another lush, mind-altering, sonic experiment that converges into an atypical mix of folk, indie and metal.
Under the moniker Mount Eerie, Phil Elverum’s music career has seen the release of dozens of full-length albums, EPs and live experimentations.  In a nutshell, he has been stylistically inconsistent in the best possible way.  On the album “Wind’s Poem” he delved into black metal inspired by the likes of Leviathan and Wolves in the Throne Room — he played indie back when he led lo-fi band The Microphones.  
Now, his latest album “Ocean Roar” is the second of twin albums released in 2012, the first being “Clear Moon,” which was more normative in structure and bled dark tones.  Both albums were written in Elverum’s old church-cum-studio two years in the making.  
Released by his namesake label, P.W. Elverum & Sun, Ltd., on Sept. 4, “Ocean Roar” brings the sound towards the light with mysterious and lonesome contemplations of nature and living memories.  
The album begins with “Pale Lights,” one of the album’s most dynamic songs, bolstered by a cymbal-driven beat replete with grinding guitar.  With that kind of energetic sound, you’d expect Elverum to start singing but, not so; he’ll have you wait until the 3:05 mark before you hear his first delivery. As the song reaches its final minutes, a constant stream of something that sounds like a distorted harpsichord beckons listeners to lose themselves in the thrill of looking over some majestic mountain.  
The title song “Ocean Roar” features a chorus of female-backing vocalists that harmonizes with Elverum’s soft lilt. There is definitely a lighter feel to this song, which is made more evident by the peals of children’s laughter at the very end.    
“Waves” erupts with a rolling groundswell of ferocious, drum crescendos and atmospheric guitar.  In fact, Elverum’s penchant for the scenic and epic might stem from his upbringing in the forests of Oregon.  Each song seems to emulate the looming threat of the fantastical and unsettling enormity of nature’s essential elements.  
Abandonment and wandering wonderment of the suburban wilderness plays out in “I Walked Home Beholding.” With the infrequency of vocalization, listeners are left hanging onto every word that Elverum sings of storms and the calm wake, “tossed on the waves, blown onto land, grasping meaning, in churning mess, a moment of clear air breathing, seeing the expanse totally at peace with the meaninglessness of living.”
Overall, “Ocean Roar” pays skillful attention to both electronic and acoustic signatures. The combination will take your mind from heavy visceral bleakness to an almost wistful meditation of organic life.  As you listen to Mount Eerie, let the unexpected become the expected.

Remember back in May, Game 5 of the Eastern Conference semifinals between the Washington Capitals and New York Rangers? Remember how the Rangers scored the game-tying goal with 6.6 seconds left in regulation, and then won in overtime? That was awesome. 
Oh sorry, I forgot what city I was in.
Great hockey moments like this will have to be put on hold for a while, as the NHL owners and NHL players appear to be heading towards another lockout, which would be the second in the last eight years.
If the players and owners can’t reach an agreement by Sept. 15, the season will not start on time.
Just like the NFL and NBA lockouts a year ago, the NHL billionaires (the owners) want to cut the salaries of the NHL millionaires (the players) from 57 percent of league revenue to 46 percent. 
That revenue for the 2011-2012 season was a record 3.3 billion dollars. Forbes reported that the average value of an NHL team has increased five percent since the 2010-2011 season, and 20 percent since 2007.
Those figures do not make it sound like the owners are short of money.
Overall attendance of NHL games has increased 1.8 percent from the year before, and 2.8 percent from the 2009-2010 season.
The owners clearly don’t mind spending money. The Minnesota Wild signed free agent forward Zach Parise and defenseman Ryan Suter to identical 13-year deals worth $98 million. That is nearly $200 million invested in just two players.
It seems odd that the owners would ask the players to take less money while signing them to ridiculous contracts.
Of course, the biggest losers of the lockout are those not directly involved with it. Television channels lose viewers, local businesses lose money and fans lose the opportunity to watch teams they care so much about. 
Unlike in 2004, another NHL lockout would be devastating for the league and would set it way back.
Last season was the year of the underdog in the NHL, as the Stanley Cup Champion Los Angeles Kings entered the playoffs as the eighth seed in the Western Conference.
In the Eastern Conference, the Florida Panthers clinched their first playoff berth in 12 years after winning the Southeast Division. The Panthers also averaged about 1,000 more fans per game than they did a season ago.
So why are the owners threatening a lockout? Like all other sports, hockey is a business with the goal of making money, and even though the league as a whole makes money, several teams are struggling to make a profit.
Should the NHL have a lockout some players, most notably reigning league MVP Evgeni Malkin, have agreed in principle to play with other teams outside of the NHL.
The draw of hockey is arguably at its highest point, and the amount of coverage is consistently increasing. More and more people are becoming hockey fans. 
A lockout would kill any momentum the league made in terms of attracting new fans and keeping current fans. It would not only jeopardize the sport in the present, but also could end up costing the NHL financially for years to come.
Commissioner Gary Bettman says that he wants to get a deal done before the deadline, but the first game of 2012 may start later than desired.

Visitors to the Corcoran Gallery of Art on the first Saturday of September shuffled past a bizarre sight: a woman dressed in a traditional Colombian attire, sweeping the floor and washing windows to the loud tune of Latin pop songs.
It was an odd sight to see at the museum’s entrance, which is flanked by 19th century busts, sculpted by Hiram Powers. Many visitors ignored the woman, giving her little more than a confused glare before going on their way, pushing through the glass-door entrance and dirtying the panes she had just cleaned. One of the spectators, who had joined a small crowd gathered around this event, even blurted out, “What’s with that window-washer?” 
However, the woman wasn’t a member of the museum’s janitorial staff. Her name is Carolina Mayorga, and she was performing her latest act, “Maid in the USA,” in which she works to explore the stereotypes, both visible and unseen, that revolve around Latin Americans in this nation’s service industry.
“Maid in the USA” is part of the Corcoran’s nine-week series entitled “Take It to the Bridge.” The series revolves around a glass-box, known as “the Bridge,” which was built atop the doors of the museum’s entranceway.
Occasionally, Mayorga would climb a ladder and place herself in the box. That’s no easy feat, considering the burdensome dress she was wearing.
“It’s so unexpected to see this kind of piece in a gallery setting,” Sarah Durkee, the museum’s vice president of public education, said. “But it’s great, because it allows us to experiment with our audience. People can’t help but interact with the performance.”
“Maid in the USA” offered an easy-to-miss glimpse into a world that is often ignored. Despite the obvious humor of watching a woman dressed in traditional garb taking her lunch-break in a transparent glass-box, there was obviously a great deal of heart put into the work. While it is an odd sight to see in a museum setting hosting pieces that range from Peale to Picasso, “Maid in the USA” was an interesting, if not thought-provoking, act showcasing a people and service that is often taken for granted.  
Two performances remain for the Bridge series. “Bridging the Light,” by Anne Albagli, will begin on Sept. 9, and will set out to explore the manipulation of light that can be achieved through the transparent glass-box atop the Corcoran’s entrance. The series will conclude on Sept. 15, with “This Space Occupied (by Maida),” wherein Maida Withers and Steve Hilmy will work from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. improvising a performance centered around the Occupy Movement.

A ceramic sheep was stolen outside Bender Library on Sept. 6.   
Public Safety launched a full investigation, but the sheep was voluntarily returned to the library three days later. 
Two library monitors chased the perpetrator who escaped down the School of International Service parking garage ramp around 10 p.m. last Thursday, said Mary Mintz, associate director for outreach at the Bender Library.   
“The monitors called Public Safety because he’s kind of a valuable animal. We can’t have a sheep rustling,” she said. “I told the officer that if he [the sheep]’s returned unharmed, we’d rather not have the person prosecuted.” 
Mintz said Public Safety originally believed that the sheep was located in Kreeger Hall after the Twitter account @DatLibrarySheep tweeted “im…lost in Kreeger.”
Public Safety originally believed the person behind the Twitter account was the perpetrator but found nothing after conducting a search in Kreeger Hall.  
The sheep first appeared outside the library during the first week of classes in an effort to promote the library’s tours and walk-in research classes.  
“We think that fits in well with the spirit of all AU students that you’re activist, you give back to society, you care about families in need, globally and locally,” Mintz said.
Participants in the classes can win an iPad, SmarTrip metro card or a sheep for a needy family.  The sheep will be donated in the winner’s name through Heifer International, an organization that donates animals to poor countries. 
The prize drawing will be held on Dec. 3.  
Bender Library has worked with Heifer International to promote the classes for the past eight years. The goal is to remind students of the resources available to improve their research skills, according to Mintz. 
Almost 1,000 students participated in the classes last year, but the library does not have a specific target goal in mind for this year, Mintz said.  
“I think there are a lot of AU students who are interested in doing better research,” she said. “Faculty tell me that when they get a paper, they can tell if somebody has just Googled, even Google Scholar, versus using the databases.” 
Classes are offered on a variety of subjects and skill levels, so even the more advanced students can benefit. The “Ask a Librarian” page on the library’s website also features a recently-updated FAQ list, email advice and the option to chat with a librarian.  
“But let’s be honest, no one really uses them,” said Jennifer To, a senior in the School of Public Affairs and a front desk receptionist at the library. 
However, she said these resources are a good reminder of the resources that the library offers before midterms and finals.
