Director M. Night Shyamalan’s “The Visit” redefines the found footage, or pseudo-documentary, genre of horror in a way that will delight viewers. Refreshingly funny and beautifully shot, the film follows 15-year-old Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and 13-year-old Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) as they visit their grandparents for the first time in their lives. Their mother (Kathryn Hahn) hasn’t spoken to her parents in 15 years and Becca, who loves making movies, decides to make a documentary to unearth the reasons behind the estrangement and remedy their relationship. 
The found footage genre has degenerated over the years, and Shyamalan has created a much needed and refreshing new take on the genre. “The Visit” quickly jumps back and forth between humorous and sinister scenes, but it does so effectively and makes for a fun ride. Shyamalan also ties in moments of intense drama, such as when the siblings bond over how they feel about their dad leaving the family. These sentimental moments help to flesh out the characters and contribute to the believability of the plot. 
When Becca and Tyler arrive at their grandparents’ house, everything appears normal. Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) seem excited to see their grandchildren for the first time. But they insist upon one rule: bedtime is at 9:30, after which the siblings are not allowed to leave their room. But after 9:30 on the first night, they hear strange noises and their grandparents’ behavior becomes more and more erratic. Their curiosity becomes too much to bear, and they venture out of their room.
Oxenbould’s hysterical portrayal of Tyler as a precocious preteen who loves to rap provides much needed comic relief throughout the film. While Oxenbould certainly stole the show, every character in the film delivered a solid performance. Dunagan and McRobbie deserve praise for their creepy ability to be so sweet and loving one moment then vicious and cold the next moment. 
M. Night Shyamalan doesn’t disappoint with his characteristic twist, and moviegoers will be left dumbfounded. Unlike recent horror films like the “Paranormal Activity” series, the found footage in “The Visit” doesn’t serve as a crutch to support a weak plot. Although Shyamalan has been producing some lackluster films recently, he brought his “A game” with “The Visit.” 
Grade: A
“The Visit” (PG-13, 94 min) is now playing at Regal Gallery Place Stadium.

The women’s volleyball team recently returned to campus after a national tournament in Honolulu with three losses and a taste of high-level competition they may face in the NCAA tournament later this fall.  
In the first game of the Hawaiian Airlines Wahine Volleyball Classic, AU was immediately strained, losing 3-0 to No. 25 University of California Los Angeles. The tournament continued to challenge the Eagles, and they recorded a second loss on Sept. 6 against No. 17 University of Hawaii 3-0. Later that day, AU lost 3-1 to University of Iowa. 
“We had moments where we competed with every one of these teams, but in the long run, their hitters wore us out,” head coach Barry Goldberg told  AUEagles.com “We're playing against some of the top [teams] in the country. They've got to improve their capabilities to try to be competitive with this kind of teams.” 
The loss to Iowa marked AU’s fourth consecutive loss. Goldberg said the early season schedule would test his team, according to a previous interview with The Eagle. But he said he looks forward to watching his team rise to the occasional and compete against top-ranked programs. 
“We’re going to be challenged, but we’ve got some competitors on our team, and it’ll be a really fun and exciting season for us,” Goldberg said. 
Goldberg has traditionally set up a tough non-conference schedule for his team in the early months of the year with the hopes of preparing his athletes for NCAA Tournament competition. In 2014 the Eagles faced third-ranked Pennsylvania State University, eighth-ranked Florida State University and No. 24 University of Kansas in the September Villanova Classic. 
In the game against UCLA, AU lost in three straight sets, 19-25, 19-25 and 18-25. The Eagles kept the first set tight until falling behind 19-16 after a UCLA kill, ace and an AU serving error. The Bruins finished the Eagles with a 25-19 match kill by junior outside hitter Jordan Anderson. The second and third matches followed the pattern of the first, an early UCLA lead with AU chasing and ultimately faltering. 
Senior outside hitter Allison Cappellino led AU with eight kills and fellow senior opposite hitter Kristyna Lindovska logged seven kills of her own. The Eagles, as a team, out-blocked the Bruins 8-5 but were out-aced 3-0. 
Hawaii, the host of the tournament, brought the same level of energy and proved to be just as difficult of an opponent as UCLA. The Rainbow Wahine edged out the Eagles 22-25, 18-25 and 20-25. Cappellino again earned the most kills of the team, recording ten over the course of the game. Freshman outside hitter Aleksandra Kazala earned eight kills and eight digs. 
In the last game of the tournament, the Eagles faced Big Ten foe Iowa and finally earned their first set win of the weekend, despite still dropping 3-1 in the game. The Eagles suffered a loss in the first set, 25-15, but rallied back to capture the second set 25-21. Iowa closed out the match with 25-22 and 25-19 wins in the following two sets. Kazala continued her hot streak from the match against Hawaii and collected career-high 12 kills and 13 digs. The double-double is the first of Kazala’s career. 
The Eagles travel to Columbia University today to take on Northeastern University, New Jersey Institute of Technology and Columbia University in the Columbia Invitation this week. Although the team enters the tournament fresh off a collection of losses, Goldberg said he remains positive about his team’s performance and hopeful for the future. 
“We're never happy with falling down, but if we can tighten up our game a little bit, I think we have a chance to be a really good team still,” Goldberg said. “I think we're headed in the right direction, but we're not completely there." 
Correction: A previous version of this article misreported the score of the first set in AU's game against Iowa. The Eagles lost the third set 25-15. jreyes@theeagleonline.com

Comedian Jessica Williams speaks about her life in an event co-sponsored by KPU and the School of Communication on Sept. 10.
Comedian Jessica Williams spoke to a crowd of nearly one thousand students and faculty in Bender Arena on Thursday night about her career, urging those who are racial or sexual minorities to share their stories and break into the world of arts.
“Now is a good time to be any sort of minority or however you identify,” Williams said. “Because the stories right now are fucking old. They need you. You have something to offer. You are valid.”
Williams’ remarks ranged from light to serious, often eliciting laughter and applause from the crowd. She spoke about her journey from being raised in a black, middle class, conservative Christian household to becoming the youngest correspondent in program history on “The Daily Show.”
“I feel like I sort of grew up on ‘The Daily Show,’” Williams said. “It was the first time that I was really exposed to things that were just racism and pure hate.”
The writer and performer was hired for the show in 2012, while she was still in college at  California State University, Long Beach, and has been a correspondent for the past three years. She said she originally gained her sense of humor from her grandmother, who was physically immobile and watched a lot of television. Williams remembered watching comedic programs like South Park, Conan O’Brien’s late night show and Saturday Night Live while she was growing up.
“I saw that this was something that took her out of this prison that her body became, and I knew I wanted to do something like that,” she said.
Telling stories about her experiences with race, gender, mental health and religion, Williams said that her character as a correspondent is driven by raw emotion, especially when a tragedy or instance of police brutality has occurred.
“It's just the same circus, and the media perpetuates it, and we're supposed to just sit here,” she said. “A lot of times I feel like I am walking around just mad. I'm angry all the time. Sometimes I feel like I can just scream at any time because I'm walking around with this nuggets of pure anger [in me].”
During her remarks, Williams shared a clip of one of her more popular segments from the show, called “Frisky Business”, which mocks “stop-and-frisk,” a police tactic in New York City often used to profile young black residents. She said that piece was the first time she truly found her character.
Afterwards, Williams took questions from the crowd, including one from an Eagle reporter about where she draws the line between freedom of speech and sensitivity towards others when making jokes.
“I can only draw that line for myself personally because, at the end of the day, the only thing I can control is me,” she said. “Where I draw the line is things that push on or oppress people that don't need it.”
The event was sold out after 1,000 tickets had been made available online to the AU community. Williams ended her appearance on a positive note, saying that she felt less alone in her work because of other people of color and women who have told her how much they connected with her bits on “The Daily Show.”
“We all feel that sort of craziness, we feel that we are in this word where things are out of control,” she said. “What helps me sleep at night is knowing that I am not the only person, and if that is the case then I can create something or create art that people can identify with.”
