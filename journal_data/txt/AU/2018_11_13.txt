Chamber Singers perform “In Our Hands: Music Shaped by the New World” on Nov. 4.
The American University Chamber Singers’ winter concert, “In Our Hands: Music Shaped by the New World,” took audience members on an alluring journey through time and place right in the comfort of our very own Abramson Family Recital Hall on Nov. 4. The ensemble seamlessly linked a myriad of styles from European, Latin American and North American traditions, all leading up to a feature on choral music in the modern United States. 
Chamber Singers conductor Casey Cook introduced the concert as “a program of music from various different traditions.” Delving into the history of music theory and performance between pieces, he explained the intricacies of these varying styles and how they ultimately “shaped modern America’s music.”
Listening to the ensemble’s introspective and enlightening take on musical development across cultures and regions was a remarkably educational experience. Beginning the concert with German composer Felix Mendelssohn’s “Weihnachten,” the ensemble emerged with a strong, unified sound, allowing audience members to relish in the piece’s overlapping melodies and swells. 
In preparation for their upcoming tour of Greece this May, the performance transitioned to two Greek pieces. Greek composer Francesco Londariti’s “Kyrie” showcased the group’s balanced blend of harmonies across registers, while their rendition of Theodore Antoniou’s “Hymn to Love” enchanted the audience with their pure, open tone.
The Chamber Singers further expanded their horizons, quite literally, in their performances of pieces from the Western Hemisphere, specifically Latin America and Cuba. Cuban musician Miguel Matamoros’ “Son de la Loma” showcased a brighter tone and bouncier rhythms, as well as an overall honeyed sound, as the high soprano melody expanded to include fuller harmonies. 
Another crowd favorite from this section was Guido López Galiván’s “El Guayaboso.” This piece falls under the Cuban subgenre of rumba, known as guaguancó, and it immediately wowed audience members with its quick, percussive tempo. As the piece progressed, the juxtaposition of upbeat vocal percussion with sections of fuller, more extravagant, and united harmonies set the scene for the fascinating unfolding of “a tall tale children’s rhyme,” as Cook described the piece.
“We move from Cuba to North America!” he announced. The Chamber Singers’ tribute to North American musical traditions featured Revolutionary-era pieces, including “Rose of Sharon” composed by William Billings, the first American choral composer, and spirituals such as “Daniel, Daniel, Servant of the Lord.” 
The most memorable piece from this section was their performance of Canadian composer R. Murray Schafer’s “Miniwanka,” which Cook prefaced as a “slightly stranger piece.” He introduced the piece by first holding up the music score to the audience and allowing the audience to see for themselves the improvisatory, atypical notation system they were to perform. 
Aspiring to recreate the various sounds of the water cycle, ranging from “a calm lake” to “a roaring ocean in the midst of a storm,” the Chamber Singers experimented with a combination of vocal percussion and sliding pitches, ultimately amplifying their already captivating, euphonic performance.
The concert interlaced performance and educational explanations by Cook on how the music of modern America draws from various traditions “from gospel to spiritual to folk songs to tunes from Appalachia to modern tone cluster singing.” The varying styles and techniques between the ensemble’s performances of Shawn Kirchner’s “Hallelujah,” “I’ll Fly Away,” and “Unclouded Day” were a testament to the vast array of traditions and techniques now represented in American music today.
Each ensemble member’s musical precision and personal involvement added to the educational and interdisciplinary nature of this concert, as it shone a light on musical development over history. If you ever have the chance to attend a performance by the Chamber Singers, I highly recommend it. This concert provided an insightful and entertaining glimpse of the history of music theory, featuring a wide variety of pieces that anyone can enjoy.

A student speaks at the "Is Health Care a Right?" debate hosted by Students for Free Expression on Oct. 4. 
Students for Free Expression (SFE), a new student organization promoting open discourse on campus, is on a mission to bring speakers from all corners of the political spectrum to engage with students. 
Sophomores Daniel Acosta Rivas and Kailash Fox co-founded the organization as freshmen after discovering AU’s “red light” rating from the free speech organization Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). AU’s standing with FIRE has since improved to “yellow-light,” which indicates that the University has “at least one ambiguous policy that too easily encourages administrative abuse and arbitrary application” of free speech codes, according to FIRE.
On Oct. 4, SFE held their first event of the year, a student-led debate on whether health care is a right. Partnering with Better Angels, a depolarization organization, the debate took a parliamentary format, allowing any student in attendance to chime in. According to Acosta Rivas, the event far exceeded attendance expectations, with approximately 75 students in attendance, fueled by an assignment for AUx, the University’s mandatory course for first-year students.
Acosta Rivas was thrilled by the AUx assignment, which asked students to go to an event outside their comfort zone. 
“A lot of people equate things that are out of their comfort zone with being dangerous, but exposing yourself to something uncomfortable can help you learn,” Acosta Rivas said. 
Freshman Yardena Gerwin, who attended the event, was awed by the rigorous discussion on display. 
“[It was] amazing to see students speak so eloquently on what defined the issue to them, be it the financial, moral or logistical side of the issue,” Gerwin said. 
From SFE’s perspective, Gerwin was a major success story. She attended the event assuming she would be in an audience role, but found herself in the front of the room, sharing that she “would not be alive had it not been for my health insurance and care.”
Unlike other “liberty-based” groups on campus, Acosta Rivas insists that SFE is “strictly non-partisan.” 
“People jump to assume that organizations like this are right-wing,” Acosta Rivas said. “We want to take back the idea that free speech is a partisan idea.”
Professor Thomas Merrill, the group’s faculty advisor, found himself involved with the organization through his work with the Political Theory Institute at AU. Merrill is a fervent advocate for the debate style used at the event. 
“We all come to these conversations with a framework of core values and judge evidence through this framework, so without discussing our core values, we may never see them as frameworks to begin with,” Merrill said. 
SFE has found many allies on campus, including School of Public Affairs professor Lara Schwartz and her Civil Discourse Project. Schwartz met with Acosta Rivas when the organization was founded and agreed to host SFE students on the Civil Discourse Project’s “Real Talk” blog. 
“The aspirations and possibilities of speech, and not the outer limits of what's allowed, are what interest me,” Schwartz said. 
The group will continue to promote dialogue on AU’s campus without taking on political views of its own, Acosta Rivas said. 
“Debate isn’t about winning, it’s about exchanging ideas,” he said.

At the University, there are a multitude of clubs and activities for students to get involved in. Based on the AU Class of 2022 numbers, the class demographics show that 65 percent  are females and 35 percent are males. Even though women make up most of the student population, we still see several male-dominated clubs and activities at AU. Residence Hall Association (RHA) and Student Government are prime examples of this skewed gender ratio. As we see more males being elected to Student Government and RHA positions, we should be asking ourselves why this gender disparity happens.
Throughout high school, I participated in speech and debate. I took it upon myself to get involved with one of the most challenging events, extemporaneous speaking. Extemporaneous speaking, extemp for short, was an intellectually challenging event where you have 30 minutes to prepare a cohesive speech answering a question pertinent to the world today. For this event, one must be politically up to date and able to quickly formulate ideas. 
After my first couple tournaments, I noticed I was one of few girls on the circuit. There would be many times where I was in a room full of just boys. I noticed that those who qualified for finals were all men. But being the minority in such clubs didn’t stop in high school. 
We should encourage women to participate in such clubs and events. We should offer other females bouts of encouragement and support their pursuits in whatever field they wish. They should not be swayed by overwhelmingly male populations in clubs they wish to attend. This trend can grow into something more deep-rooted and serious. This trend can carry over into careers, which is where it becomes more dangerous. 
If a young female student is discouraged from running for RHA council, this will deter her from running for president in the future. The idea of women in politics is an example of a subject that is still not accepted by all members of society. While the world’s top companies are still mostly run by men, a Peterson Institute survey of almost 22,000 firms from 91 countries tells us that “women in corporate leadership positions can contribute to and advance a firm’s performance.” 
Why should we set the precedent now? I remember the joy of seeing another girl in one of my extemp rounds. Women are inspired by women. The 2015 KPMG Women’s Leadership study concluded that 86 percent of women see possibility of gaining a leadership position and feel it is more attainable when they see more women in these positions. 
What does this look like in practice for AU students? Champion girls who participate in a mostly male-dominated activity. Understand their bravery for setting precedents for women in the future. 
Based on my experience being one of the few female extempers, I understand how it feels. Women interested in running for RHA council or Student Government should undoubtedly do so. It is time we start deconstructing these skewed beliefs and support those around us who are discouraged to seize opportunities. They can forge real change in unique ways, but we will never find out how until we see these people in such clubs and places of power.
