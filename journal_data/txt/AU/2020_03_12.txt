“I’m not trying to make any kind of message film, these films are about characters,”  “First Cow” director Kelly Reichardt said in an interview with The Eagle. “But there are themes that run through them that could be applicable to today’s world.” 
“First Cow,” which takes place in Oregon in the early 19th century, stars John Magaro as Cookie Figowitz, a cook for a party of fur trappers and Orion Lee as King-Lu, a Chinese immigrant that Cookie finds alone in the forest. The two become quick friends and begin a plot to steal milk from the first cow in the settlement. 
While the movie is based on “The Half-Life,” a 2004 novel by Jonathan Raymond, several characters, as well as the titular cow, were created by Raymond and Reichardt when trying to adapt the book for the screen. 
“You’re just trying to make particular and interesting characters,” Reichardt said.” A lot of the work was done in John [Raymond’s] novel.“The actors can kind of glean all the depth that’s been built for them. It gives the actors a lot to work with.” 
Though the film is set in Oregon in the 1820s, Reichardt made a conscious decision to steer away from any common Western tropes. 
“We’re telling this intimate story and we want the filmmaking to relate to the economy of King-Lu and Cookie,” Reichardt said. “We’re working against the grand. We used the academy ratio, which is square, that sort of gives you more foreground and depth and height as opposed to expanse.” 
Reichardt is no stranger to a pared-down, simplistic narrative structure, but says that it doesn’t reflect what’s happening behind the scenes. 
“The speed of the movie, which is the 1820’s, is not the speed we’re working at on set,” Reichardt said. “We do slow down for the cow but what’s not on camera is complete hustle, hustle, hustle.” 
Reichardt often works with the same team, which makes a movie about friendship that  much more special. 
“It’s nice to make a film in a trusting place, and I think that’s unusual to have,” Reichardt said. “It frees you up because that relationship was built from the ground, it’s not something that’s just appeared overnight.” 
Aside from directing, Reichardt is also a professor at Bard College. On the advice that she gives most to students, she said “Research is a lived experience, it’s not Google. You have to go out and live it.” 
“First Cow” was picked up by A24, and premiered at the Telluride Film Festival. It is set to release in Washington on March 12.

Mary Graydon Center (MGC) 
This story has been updated with a statement from Director of Public Affairs Stacie Burgess.
The University is extending the transition to online classes through the entire semester instead of returning to in-person instruction in April, President Sylvia Burwell announced in an email to the AU community on Thursday afternoon. 
“There are almost constant developments, and we are making decisions based on the best available information,” Burwell said in the email. “I know you have received a great deal of information, and it is a time of uncertainty. It is easy to start feeling overwhelmed, but I hope that through continued communication, we can do our part to help reduce anxiety and provide support as we move forward.”
Students remaining on campus are asked to leave as soon as possible, and must vacate residence halls by March 23, Burwell wrote. All University-sponsored public events, as well as university-sponsored domestic travel for students and official business, were also suspended through May 5. 
Burwell cited the World Health Organization’s declaration that the coronavirus has reached pandemic levels, the announcement that D.C. is now in a state of emergency, and the D.C. Department of Health’s recommendation against non-essential mass gatherings as some of the reasons behind the decision.
Professors were notified of this extension in an email from Provost Dan Meyers and Deputy Provost Mary Clark Thursday afternoon before Burwell’s campus-wide email.
“In light of the evolving situation with COVID-19, the World Health Organization’s recent declaration of a pandemic, and consultation with university and faculty leadership, we believe that our recent decision to transition to online instruction should remain in place for the remainder of the semester,” Meyers and Clark wrote.
The announcement comes less than a day after all study abroad programs were cancelled in the wake of President Trump’s decision to restrict travel between the U.S. and Europe in response to the coronavirus. 
On Tuesday, administrators told the AU community that classes would be going online starting March 18, and normal classes would resume in person on April 3. 
Stacie Burgess, the director of public affairs, told The Eagle that spring commencement will continue as scheduled. She also said that refunds to students that paid for on-campus housing and meal plans are prorating and that more information about these payments are forthcoming.
The University plans to offer training to professors to assist them with the transition to online classes, the email explained. More information and support would be provided going forward. 
This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available.

With the clock ticking and little time to spare, James Figueras - an ambitious art critic - has fallen from grace with hopes to try and restore his name, entangling his lover into his connivery. 
Director Giuseppe Capotondi’s take on Charles Willeford’s 1971 art-world crime novel is filled with electric and noirish performances by the three main leads: Claes Bang, Elizabeth Debicki and Donald Sutherland. Mick Jagger, the rock legend, portrays a deceitful gallery owner, returning to acting for the first time in almost 20 years. Jagger and the starry international cast deliver an entertaining, feverishly-hot European thriller that has you uncovering the mystery that lies within each character’s enchanting aura. 
Claes Bang, a Danish actor who first sparked attention in an art-world bubble of a different sort, Ruben Östlund’s 2017 satire “The Square,” plays James Figueras, a suave art critic who apparently doesn’t lead such a suave life. The charismatic Figueras makes all attempts to try and recover his tarnished name to regain credibility since he has been labeled a failed art critic. The film opens with Figueras rehearsing his presentation, getting dressed and prepared to put on a performance for a group of aged tourists who watch him attempt to defend his noble profession with a devilish smirk. Figueras fools and ensnares his listeners with a combination of half truths and whole lies, appearing to have no principled or honorable issue with the idea of double-dealing.  
If the viewer is familiar enough with these types of stories, they might already be able to predict what darkness lies ahead for these characters. When art dealer Joseph Cassidy (Jagger) invites Figueras and his American lover Berenice Hollis (Debicki) to his lavish Lake Como estate, Cassidy strikes a deal with the critic in exchange for offering an interview with Jerome Debney (Sutherland), a notorious and reclusive artist. Figueras is asked to steal a masterpiece from the painter’s studio at whatever cost — but how far is he willing to go to risk mending his name? The power of the critic is often revealed throughout the film in parallel to the idea that art — like love — is something that you can make or fake. With greed and precariousness, the initial scheme begins to unravel into absolute havoc.
This eloquent, Italian-set romance-thriller that epitomizes the life of a drug-muddled art critic who hopes to earn back his reputation in a cutthroat industry brings the viewers’ attention to themes expressed through the artwork exhibited in different scenes. Its prickly plot and characters’ twisted performances keep the audience guessing — up to a point. Capotondi’s film should be recognized for its ability to make the viewer feel like they are a part of the film. With an impressive classical score, composer Craig Armstrong does a notable job at enhancing the feeling of being present in the scene with the actors. Bringing the viewer’s attention to the minute details on the actors faces and surrounding environment, the film makes you feel as if you can be a part of the ambience. Any shortcomings in the film aren’t at the fault of the actors, who make the contrived and often predictable plot entertaining. 
Ultimately, “The Burnt Orange Heresy” has a deceptively simple plot to follow, showcasing many themes, ranging from war and suffering to wealth and greed. This enticingly, gripping exploit will leave you saying “Ah hah” once the dots have been connected.
However, viewers are left with a simple question: Will Figueras be able to free himself from the cave he created for himself?
“The Burnt Orange Heresy” will be in theaters on Friday, March 6, 2020.

This article has been updated with new information about winter sports cancellations.
American University has canceled its all of its spring sports effective immediately in response to growing concerns over the COVID 19 novel coronavirus. The decision came shortly after the Patriot League announced Thursday morning that it would cancel all spring practices and competitions, effective March 16. 
“Recognizing that the health and safety of our students and broader communities is our priority, and based on the ongoing spread of COVID 19 (2019 novel coronavirus), the Patriot League Council of Presidents has made the difficult and challenging decision to cancel all spring athletics practices and competitions through the remainder of the academic year,” the Patriot League said in the statement. 
The decision ends the season for women’s lacrosse and both cross country and track teams. The wrestling team is still expecting to compete at the NCAA championships next week.
Unlike the NCAA men’s and women’s basketball tournaments, which have decided to continue without fans, or the NBA and MLS, which have suspended their seasons, the Patriot League has decided to cancel the season. The Patriot League joins the Ivy League in its decision to cancel spring sports.
The Patriot League’s decision will cut short the season for women’s lacrosse who was off to their best start in program history (7-0). The team has canceled its conference opener Saturday against Lafayette.
The track team has pulled out of the Coastal Carolina Invitational Outdoor Track meet in South Carolina, which was slated to begin on Friday. The team is still in South Carolina.
The AU track and cross country team put out a statement on Twitter Thursday morning.
While we are incredibly disappointed to miss competition this spring, the health, safety and welfare of our athletes, families and fans are always the highest priority in our collective decision making, in season and out. 1/2... https://t.co/nocMnI5SGC

On Thursday afternoon, the NCAA canceled all remaining winter and spring championships in response to the virus. The NCAA announced an initial plan on Wednesday to hold the matches without a live audience but ultimately changed its decision based on the “evolving public health threat” that COVID-19 poses.
“This decision is based on the evolving COVID-19 public health threat, our ability to ensure the events do not contribute to spread of the pandemic, and the impracticality of hosting such events at any time during this academic year given ongoing decisions by other entities.”
This marks the end of the season for AU’s wrestling program, who had initially planned to send four wrestlers — redshirt juniors Kizhan Clarke (149), Tanner Harvey (184) and Gage Curry (125) and redshirt senior Sal Profaci (141) — to the NCAA Championships next week.
As a result of the decision, Profaci’s career wrestling at AU is over. After spending three years wrestling at the University of Michigan, Profaci transferred to AU for his final season. He finished the season with a 26-9 record and ranked No. 23 in the country at his weight class.

The AU Abroad office in 2017. 
In an email late Wednesday night, the University announced that in the wake of President Donald Trump’s decision to suspend all travel between Europe and the United States for the next 30 days starting Friday, all AU Abroad programs worldwide are cancelled effective immediately. 
Students abroad are required to return to their homes as soon as possible, Provost Dan Meyers and Vice President of Campus Life and Inclusive Excellence Fanta Aw wrote in the email to the AU community. All faculty and staff traveling and planning to travel are also required to cancel plans and return. 
The announcement comes days after the University announced it was moving classes online for three weeks following spring break. Students studying abroad in China, South Korea, Italy, and Spain have already been recalled. 
“AU Abroad and academic programs will be providing additional information, but given the impact of this development, we wanted to inform our community as soon as possible,” Meyers and Aw wrote in the email. 
The email said the University would work with students on “academic arrangements, travel and financial matters.”
In a separate email to students studying abroad in Europe, Mark Hayes, the director of AU Abroad, recommended that they book flights back to their permanent addresses as quickly as possible. The decision extends to students in the United Kingdom, even though the country is excluded from Trump’s announcement. 
“Further communications will be forthcoming to you very soon,” Hayes wrote in the email that arrived just before 2 a.m. in the U.K. “Please keep a close watch for new messages and be prepared to respond immediately.” 
This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available.
