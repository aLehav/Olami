There is someone else in the house.
It’s the thought portrayed in almost every horror/thriller movie that keeps hundreds up at night, clinging to their bed sheets listening for the slightest creak in their hardwood floors. It’s the fear of the unknown and the fear that the unknown could be right outside the door.
This is the premise behind “Silent House,” an unnerving horror/thriller film. From the husband-and-wife directing team of Chris Kentis and Laura Lau, “Silent House” is a remake of the Uraguayan Spanish-language film “La Casa Muda.”
“Silent House” stars Elizabeth Olsen (“Martha Marcy May Marlene”) as Sarah, a girl renovating her childhood lake house with her father, John (Adam Trese, “40 Days and 40 Nights”). But when Sarah meets a childhood friend that she has no recollection of, she starts growing suspicious.
To add to her growing paranoia, Sarah’s uncle, played by Eric Sheffer Stevens (“Julie & Julia”), starts to tell her stories describing the vandalism and drifters that have frequented their abandoned lake house.
When Sarah hears something upstairs, the plot takes a turn for the worse. The discovery of someone in the lake house turns the film into an obvious plot line where Sarah is shown in what seems like a perpetual state of running and hiding.
After Sarah finds her father injured by this unknown man, she begins to realize she is alone and trapped in a house with no cell phone reception or electricity (convenient, right?).
The interesting aspect of this film comes not from the plot but from the cinematography. “Silent House” was filmed on a 5D Mark II digital camera in one continuous shot with no cuts from beginning to end. Because of this, Sarah’s race to find a way out of her lake house is shown in real time. 
For what “Silent House” lacked in plot, was partially made up for by the casting of Olsen. From her debut in last year’s “Martha Marcy May Marlene,” Olsen has proven herself to be among the most talented new actresses in the industry. Olsen’s performance in this movie further exemplified her versatility as an actress.
Still, not even Olsen’s talents could make up for poor character development. It isn’t until the end of the movie that the audience learns any detail of Sarah’s life, which leaves viewers without any emotional investment. 
At the end of the movie, Kentis and Lau attempt to turn the plot into something the audience would never see coming. Unfortunately, the storyline did not seem to support the plot turn and made the ending of the movie almost too unexpected, leaving the audience confused and underwhelmed. 
“Silent House” is the type of horror movie you should leave for a mindless scary movie night. The filming and acting were strong, but unfortunately not strong enough to make up for the nonsensical ending.

Rant here!
 Type your rant here!  
• @"Why is everyone hating on the slut shamers!?" If you're happy in your 2 year relationship, congrats. If someone is happy "whoring themselves to every guy in EI", what do you care?? You're both happy, worthy people and who you sleep with is NOT a factor in that!
• Oh my god not everyone who has sex is screwing the first person they see. And if they are, why on earth does it matter to anyone else? Have sex with no one or have sex with everyone: that's their choice and everyone else should mind their own business because it doesn't matter!
• For the last time, Student Government has NOTHING to do with tuition money!
• @"To the ranters making Breaking Bad references, I want to sweet raw love to all of you!"
As the original poster from yesterday, this makes me so excited I just want to throw a pizza on the roof! But don't worry, I'll save the dipping sticks. ;]
• @I wish I could drop out of school and become a pokemon trainer.
I have been ranting about this to my friends and everyone I know for every single day of my life...MARRY ME PLS???
• Smoking's a choice; if smokers want to smoke, let them.  This is an awfully controlling thing to try to shove down people's throats, just saying.
• "@“Drop. Your. Sword.” Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!"
And don't forget: Never get involved in a land war in Asia!
• @ a girl- Might as well have said "You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week. So I guess you picked today. Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays." Quit hating! She's concerned about her boyfriend, don't judge her choice to wear sweatpants.
• @Alanis Morissette lyrics
I love you. That is all.
• You sir have also lost the Game.
• Wait you mean smoking is bad for you??? I can't believe no one told me that before!!! I am obviously going to quit right this second now that I know that!
• Woman, I ain't your man, so stop acting like I am!
• “And if you ACTUALLY knew what you were talking about, you’d know that unless a person’s habits and actions are affecting their, or another’s, day to day life, they dont have a problem. But good try.” LoL are you serious here? Are you aware sex involves two people? That means the actions are affecting BOTH the individual with the sluttiness issues AND the people they are sleeping with. That meets your criteria to the letter honey. But good try.
• "And now, what shall we use to conduct this beautiful current with, hm? What one particular element comes to mind, hm? Hmm?"
"Aaaah, wire." XD
• @ Hey guess what?: Hellz yeah, seems like people cant keep their mouths shut and private business to themselves
• @”I have to wonder, why is there no on campus river? I feel like my tuition should pay for such a thing.” You have no idea how often I think the exact same thing. We should least get a little steam thing going.
• Can everyone just live and let live? Just quit judging people and just BE? But I guess then there wouldn't be any Eagle Rants...
• Last semester, I had a great time at AU without out-of-class friends.  This semester, I got some and had a blast hanging out with them.  Then they randomly quit talking to me.  Now I feel super down on myself and am not having a good time at all.  Hopefully being around people who actually like me back home over break will help my confidence, because I feel really sh*tty right now...
• @”Again, can we please put the Eagle Rants tab on the website on the LEFT side of the screen, so we don’t have to expand the website each time we open the eagle website in order to access the rants.” Agreed. This is three seconds of my life WASTED each day when I have to expand the webpage. Eagle staff, GET ON THIS.
• @”I wish I could drop out of school and become a pokemon trainer. That’d be cool. But God could have made pokemon real but instead was like “Nah man. Malaria.” T_T” You’re the kind of guy I wanna marry. A) Are you single? B) Where can I find you?
• @ "I’m kind of interested in getting my ass kicked." If you come to the wrestling room in JFC on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 6 AM, you will have come to the right place.
• Does anyone else watch TV shows on Netflix, and then once you start a show you become obsessed with it and can’t do your homework until you have finished the whole season? #bing tv show watching problems
• sweatpants girl here, thanks for everyone's advice. It was all very helpful. I've talked to my bf about it and we've come to a compromise. :)
• Can we have a vending machine full of Clif bars? Is that even remotely possible?
• @"Where is Today @ AU and who thought it was a good idea to get rid of it."- Handily enough, theres a whole article about this! Right here! Online! Under the "News" section!
• @"what happens in there? Who are you people? Because I’m kind of interested in getting my ass kicked."
We're a loosely-military training group.  I'm a Marine officer candidate myself, and I design the workouts.  They will broadly strengthen all elements of functional fitness.  Do and don't be intimidated by us at the same time.  We welcome all fitness levels (many civilians are part of the group), but we WILL kick your ass :).  We're done until after break, but you won't regret joining us at 6am on the 20th.  All are welcome.
• "we don’t judge or insult you for not joining." Hmm.... I wonder how the term GDI came about??
• @"does anyone know anything about the AU running club? I tried emailing the club twice, but no one responded. does it still exist?"
I know it existed as of last semester, at least.  I'm pretty sure it's still going on now.  HOWEVER, I run a completely different club, and I can tell you from experience that those "official" email addresses usually don't get checked very often.  Your best bet is to find someone who's in it already that can give you the details.
• How about all the confident and attractive people just keep having lots of great sex with each other, and all the nervous virgins can keep calling women "sluts" and f***ing themselves?  Problem solved!
• I'm sick and tired of being judged for being male. I'm actually one of the men who is NOT a terrible person.
• I didn't get a Little. :'( I guess I'll just walk the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.
• I've cordially invited many people to my pants party but as of yet no one has RSVP-ed. What should I do?
• No matter, how much I try, I cannot will myself to finish this paper.
• Re the leggings as pants debate, and this also applies to the girl with the boyfriend who doesn't like her frequent sweatpants-wearing: I used to be a anti-leggings gal. Now, I love them. They are mega comfortable. If you by a good quality pair (which doesn't have to be anywhere near expensive), they won't be so tight and revealing. And my boyfriend loves when I wear them, so wins all around!
• lol thyroid - cute.
• I just got rescued by the search and rescue raptor. Yay for being home!
• Dear freshmen who thinks they have more credits than me. You dont. You're just like everyone else at this school who thinks their smart. STFU or GTFO
• @people complaining about 30 year old guy walking around in a building: did you care to see if he worked for AU as facilities or maintenance? did you see if he had been claimed by someone? because I work at a front desk and I have seen strangers ask residents to claim them and the resident will. so double check among yourselves before blaming the people at the desk.
• @• "I’m sick of these e-mails from McBride about all the things his administration has accomplished..." If you actually read the email, it wasn't talking about the creation of a victim's advocate position, it was talking about the recent development of confidentiality for that position... which just happened this year.  Also, the email opened up with "For years."
• I WANNA MAKE LOVE WITH YOU!
• Regarding the smoking issue:Its irrelevant whether or not smoking is addicting or dangerous. I'm sorry, but if you really are so terrified of second-hand smoke that you cant stand to be around it, then you should have gone to a non-smoking school, instead of making everyone conform to you. This is a matter of liberty. People have the right to do what they want to their body. You do not have the authority to limit people's free choices. Plain and simple.
• @"Where are the AC fans?" I am a fan of air conditioning.
• Dear Person who quoted Pete's Dragon, I love you.
• Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
• Can we go back to weekly rants?  As much as I enjoy the daily rants, 1) The Rants were all around better when they only came out once a week and 2) I'm sick of these "hey post the rants already" rants.
Signed,
A Disgruntled Ranter
• why, why, WHY? cant you just respond
• I was watching Kenan and Kel tonight, and the plot was them trying to get to a double date on time. Their date was to see a movie called Teen McBride. Anytime it was brought up, I only heard Tim McBride... #AUproblems
• @"sweetie, if you want silence don’t sit outside the mud box and don’t tell me what to do cause im a freshman, i probably have more credits than you anyways."...honey, talk to me in 4 years when you grow up and think twice before you throw lip, because you don't know who you may cross.
• Banana,
Thursday night I met you on LAL. you seemed really cool. thanks again for the genuine conversation.
Apple
• Well all the friends that you knew in school, they used to be so cool, now they just bore you. Well look at them now, already pulling the plow - so quick to take to grain like some old mule.
• @virtually no sexual assaults on campus: Come to Take Back the Night, I (double-dog) dare you. Amazing how your perspective changes when you see that girl from class go up to the microphone.
• So over people hating on Women's Initiative. They go hard in the paint, get over it.
• drunk eagleranting is the bestest eagleranting
• So ready to live with people who understand that mental health is a real thing.
• Come on guys let's all be friends.
• Trouble...feels like every time I get back on my feet she come around and knock me down again.
• I will totally date a girl who wears sweatpants.
• Someone needs to start a petition or awareness campaign or something to cut down on the excessive amount of long-distance relationships (half) on this campus.
• Jose for #
• To my photo TA: If you get any hotter, I may go insane
• LISTEN UP. AU will never be smoke free, not at least until we get our campus plan approved. Where do people go when they can't smoke on campus? The neighborhood directly around campus. This is the same neighborhood that hates AU and the students. As long as the university wants to get the campus plan approved, the campus will never go smoke free. It would be a very stupid decision. (Don't get me wrong though, I totally support a smoke-free campus!)
• @"Is Women’s Initiative doing anything to get a Plan B vending machine on campus, or are they still just complaining about how we live in a “rape culture”?" ARE. YOU. JOKING. ME?? GTFO.
• To the person who responded with a hash tag about straight female conservative republican. I'm glad you people are demonized on campus. How dare you try to deny legitimate members of our society the right to marriage? Or to spend countless tax dollars on drug testing the poor to satiate your appetite for humiliation of those less fortunate than yourself? I've got a hash tag for you. #scum
• I"m just going to let you go, I like you enough to not want you to get hurt by me.
• @ whoever commented on my @5th week at the counseling center.
Thank you! Things are going very well. It's all about attitude and learning to help yourself rather than having someone else help you. It's rather exciting. Good luck with you too! Just remember to trust yourself, be yourself, and believe in yourself! (little words of wisdom I tell myself everyday to keep going, it sounds cheesy I know) LOVE YOUR LIFE everyone! It gets better :-)
• To the girl whose dog just had puppies and who let her sorority sisters take them out on the quad: Those little bundles of joy made my day, and you are amazing. I would love to have one if I could in my dorm! XP They were really so adorable. :']
• to awful lotta high class honkeys: please quit your whining - at least sometimes. it's getting old.
• Gov. Brewer "deserves to be protested," while at the same time we should welcome a "saint" with open arms who named a sitting US Senator and Presidential candidate after a sex act... Way to go AU. Disgusting.
• TY TY RAH RAH!! ;) you fine like dynamite.
• T,
YOU'RE SEXY AND I KNOW IT!!
-curiousgal
• So excited to have the room to myself! Zumba every day!!!
• Is there a way I could get an e-mail when rants are posted. Am I too obsessed?
• Please post rants are at a more consistent time (like 5 each day). This week's times have ranged 4:34 pm to 9:30 pm. I need consistency in order to plan my daily schedule of activities. Thanks.
• omg you suck for not responding to my texts. i'm just bored and want you to come have sex with me, sheesh.
• Guys at TDR were making fun of us for staying on campus during Spring Break, calling us nerds.  Not to sound elitist, but I don't think I'm going to be taking life advice from a TDR worker.
• To the kid in my lit class who always disrespects the teacher: I'm not saying I love everything about her. But I'm putting time and money into that class, and if you don't shut up FAST, we will have a problem. PS: your paper was terrible and it DIDN'T fit the assignment. true story. stop whining.
