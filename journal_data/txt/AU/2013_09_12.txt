Kelly McCaddin led the Eagles with 15 kills against Coppin State
The AU Volleyball team remained undefeated with a three set sweep Sept. 11 against Coppin State in Baltimore.
The first set was competitive with both teams matching points 12 times. AU  (7-0, 0-0 PL) took the lead for good when Coppin State’s  (1-7, 0-0 MEAC) outside hitter Nicole Malave committed an attack error to put AU up 13-12. It was all AU needed as it went on a 12-6 run, capped off by kill from junior middle blocker Kelly McCaddin, to take the first set 25-18.
The second set opened with AU going on a 7-1 run before Coppin State called a timeout. AU would hold onto its lead, as large as 15 points. Coppin State managed only eight points in the entire set giving AU the 25-8 victory, taking set two.
In the final set of the match, AU jumped out to an 8-0 lead. AU’s dominant second set carried momentum over to the third set as the team held a double digit lead over Coppin State throughout the entire set.
After junior libero Megan Rosburg delivered an ace pushing the score to 20-9 AU, Coppin State made an effort to tie the game trading scores late in the match. Ultimately this was too little, too late as AU took the final set 25-15 securing its seventh straight victory
AU looks to remain undefeated Sept.14-15 at the Crowne Plaza Invitational in Philadelphia.

Krishna Temple in Udupi
I’m a “When in Rome” type of person, and by that I mean that I try to fit in when visiting a foreign country. 
All too aware of the stigma attached to Americans abroad, I try my best to be culturally sensitive and respect the locals. Sometimes I can tell this is appreciated. Other times it ends in hilarity.
By my pale skin alone, it’s clear that I am foreign. Still, I dress in traditional Indian clothing, stand up when professors enter the room and eat exclusively with my right hand, sitting on my left to avoid making a giant faux pas. 
But India is a place of tradition and rituals like no other, and since I came here knowing next to nothing about them, the learning curve has been steep. The smallest things bring me back to freshman year when I didn’t know how to use the laundry machines and got lost going to Tenleytown. 
Even things like crossing the road are different. Traffic not only comes from the opposite direction, but crosswalks and sidewalks are nonexistent. If they do appear they are not respected by the motorcycles, cars, auto rickshaws, bicycles, pedestrians and animals that all use the streets of Manipal. Within my first week I learned from experience that perhaps the only time a rickshaw will stop to let you cross is when you slip and fall in its path. Maybe I was just lucky.
A pinnacle of this learning process came during a Krishna Janmashtami celebration a couple weeks ago. Krishna Janmashtami is the birth of the Hindu deity Krishna. A few of us decided to go to the service at the local temple, wanting to experience the holiday. The service was completely in Sanskrit, but we sat cross-legged in the crowd, attempting to follow along. When people stood, I stood. When gongs and bells sounded, I tried not to jump. When people lined up to receive a blessing, I followed, not knowing what the blessing was, but dutifully taking the holy water and thanking Krishna as I put it on my head.
Finally, the ceremony ended, and it was time for the free food promised to us from the beginning. Like most college students, free food is one thing that I know. I am good at receiving free food. But instead of Georgetown cupcakes, these baked goods were easily 95 percent sugar, had a texture resembling chalk and were liberally piled on my plate. The main dish was not pizza, but a heavy rice dish with coconut. I soon realized that there was no way I could finish this small mountain of food. 
And this was a problem. As part of the ceremony, you have to finish since the food was blessed by Krishna. The temple was soon empty with only our group of Americans and half-full plates remaining. As the priests started cleaning up, our desperation grew. Looking around for a trashcan or stray dog, I slipped a few of the baked goods into my bag to make my plate look emptier and motioned for others to do the same. We discreetly stacked our plates with the empty ones on top, concealing the mounds of leftover curry. With my bag full of baked goods, I guiltily left the temple, feeling more American than usual. 
Forgive me, Krishna, I thought. I’m but a mere foreigner.

“Insidious: Chapter 2” is ridiculous, convoluted and incoherent, but somehow inexplicably enjoyable.
Picking up events where they left off from the first installment, Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne, “Bridesmaids”) gives a testimony to the police about the strange events surrounding the conclusion of “Insidious.” 
The medium Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye, “Crazy Kind of Love”) is killed in an attempt to save the Lambert’s son from the Further during a seance. She is successful, but the suspicions of her death are pinned on Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson, “The Conjuring”). Eventually, the Lamberts move back into Josh’s family house where the paranormal begins to take hold. 
The second “chapter” is all over the place and seems there was never an intent on a sequel. Not since Joe Dante’s “Gremlins 2” has a director seemed so disinterested in creating a sequel. 
“Insidious: Chapter 2” is by no means a sound movie. The story hacks away at continuity and asks the audience to forget what they learned at the end of “Insidious.” The final film appears as a mix of “Mommy Dearest,” “Back to the Future,” “Ghostbusters,” “Aerobicide,” “Abbott and Costello,” “The Omen,” “The Avengers” and the slightest hint of “Bioshock: Infinite.”  
It is certainly not as engrossing as “The Conjuring,” but somehow by some supernatural stroke of luck, “Insidious: Chapter 2” boomerangs around as an enjoyable, but flawed second installment.

Word on the street is that Yellowcard is coming to town this month. It’s been 10 years since their breakout single “Ocean Avenue” was released and launched the Florida based pop-punk band to commercial success all over the country. 
The Eagle couldn’t miss out on the opportunity to exchange some words with the band and engage in a long, in-depth interview with Sean Mackin, Yellowcard’s violinist and backing vocalist.
Tam Sackman: Let’s go back to the beginning. How did Yellowcard form and what is the significance of the name Yellowcard?
Sean Mackin: Well, we were a group of friends in high school and…  we kind of had a catchphrase for a party foul. This party foul term we used was “Yellowcard.” So out of this group of friends we started playing some songs and playing some shows and that was the birth of Yellowcard.
TS: Looking back, how do you feel about “Ocean Avenue” as the album that really brought you into the public eye? Is there anything that you would change?
SM: Absolutely not. I’m so fortunate to have been at a point in my life where I met the guys in Yellowcard and get to play music for a living. When I was growing up, my mom was like “Hey, you’re going to play violin. If you’re living in my house, you’re going to do it.” And I was like “Mom, I don’t want to play violin! I want to play basketball with my friends! Violin is not cool.” She was like “It’s a gift, and you’re gonna thank me for it.” And she was right. I get to play music every day with my friends and it’s amazing. Ocean Avenue is a major part of the legacy of Yellowcard. I love it and I embrace it and we’re celebrating that now on the Ocean Avenue 10 year tour.
TS: Why did you wait 10 years to release the acoustic album and why release an acoustic album at all?
SM: Well, we wanted to do something special. A lot of our songs are conceived in an acoustic fashion or with an acoustic guitar. Kind of just sitting there, f*cking around and playing songs. And so a lot of our fans have always asked about it and we wanted to do something special for our 10 year anniversary, so we worked really hard for a full studio re-release. 
TS: Your most recent album is “Southern Air” (besides “Ocean Avenue Acoustic”). What’s different about your music now as opposed to how it was at the time  “Ocean Avenue” was originally released?
SM: I think there are similarities. We’re still the same people, the same formula is still there, so you have a vintage Yellowcard sound. Almost everything else about our music has changed though and art mimics life.  Our lives have evolved and changed, so our music may have more mature themes, a bigger sound, maybe something darker at times. But when we came out with “Southern Air,” it was really kind of a…I don’t want to say nostalgic feeling…but it was a great feeling that our singer captured after we had spent some time on the road. He had spent some time in Georgia and kind of fell in love with the idea of being at home and being where you had come from and that energy had transferred into our songs. I think you can really get a sense of the heart and soul of Yellowcard off of “Southern Air.”
TS: How do you think you’re able to keep so many lifelong fans, those who have been listening to you since the early 2000s, even before that, potentially, and now are coming to see you on tour with this acoustic album?
SM: I have no idea and I have no control over that. That’s why you’ll hear me talk about how grateful we are to have such wonderful fans that care about us. Any challenges that we go through in our lives, the fans are there. And that’s great therapy for anyone. I can’t really take credit for that. And we’re just really happy to be where Yellowcard is at right now and we want to continue doing this for a long time.
TS: So what’s the future of Yellowcard looking like?
SM: It’s looking bright! We’re always working on new material and we’re really excited to see what the future holds. This is a big, big moment for Yellowcard. A big time for us to kind of just sit back and celebrate the songs that we’ve created. We’re really enjoying the Ocean Avenue tour, and we get about four months where we can just enjoy the moment, and we’ve worked really hard on this set. If anyone’s been a fan of Yellowcard, I definitely wouldn’t miss this one.
Come out and see Sean and the rest of Yellowcard on Sept. 18 at the Fillmore Silver Spring. Tickets are still available online.
