• Crisis averted.
• At first blush, the idea of a Men's Initiative is ludicrous; men are not so disadvantaged as to need help getting a leg up.  But on second thought, it could be really useful, especially if it could help teach what it means to be a man.  After reading through so many of these Rants, it is clear that the campus is full of boys and there are few men to be found.  
• PLEASE VOTE NO ON THE REFERENDUM. Really, you guys don't know how important this is. It's the same SG drama queens rewriting the rules to give themselves more power. It's not the system that's broken, it's the people. 
• Everyday I end up hating myself for spending time with you as a "friend" I really like you but your stuck in a really serious relationship. You deserve better.
• To everyone saying the shirts at the gym are fine because of free speech, clearly you have never battled an eating disorder or had someone close to you battle with one. Yes, we have a right to free speech, but something that is as triggering as that for someone battling or in recovery should never be ok on a college campus. Recovering from an eating disorder is one of the hardest fought battles someone could ever go through and it scares me that people at my same school could be so unsympathetic. 
• Hey! The Eagle Online should switch to Wordpress, because if you're moving to digital it should at least look good. The website now looks pretty shoddy- even with the revamp. Step it up Eagle.
[Editor’s Note: Actually already working on it.]
• @ I honestly hate this school: I don't know what your religious beliefs are, but you should try hanging out with the Methodist community. Outside of worship (7pm on sundays, 11pm on thursdays) our conversations mostly revolve around science fiction, plot holes in works of pop culture, movies, and sometimes even musical theater. If you aren't a Christian, we won't try to convert you either, so it's worth a shot right.  Just stop by the basement of Kay...pretty much anytime of the week (but especially wednesday late-afternoon)
• If I'm studying alone at the silent floor, I'm trying to get work done. I don't want random people coming up to me and trying to telepathically flirt with me.
• @ tfw no qt3.14 gf

• Straight, single, somewhat attractive, man here!  What do I do to rectify this!?
• SG does something? Really? If every member of SG were to give me a hand job, then and only then will I give them props.
• @The person who called me a Stalinist on the 9th
Use what epithets you will, sir. All I want is for the 60s wannabes to shut up, and for the hired, paid, experienced professionals to do what they are chosen to do, without any more frivolous interruptions by students. SG is an incompetent waste, SA is a lie, CAUS is ridiculous, and it is about damn time we just got rid of it all, and focused on external involvement instead. If being a Stalinist means wanting a properly run, efficient and more peaceful AU, then Slava Stalina!

• Women only gym hours are a great way to keep the place empty to clean it.
• Jacobs =/= Curves

• Are you trying to say Kate Mara is more or less attractive than Spacey?  Because I'm crazy in love with Zoe Barnes.  Watching the season one finale right now.
• PIZZA HUT. WTF? I ORDER A MEAT LOVERS PIZZA AND I DON'T GET A PIZZA WITH A BUNCH OF SEVERED DONGS ON TOP. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
• The maintenance man is here and I can't fart freely. I feel like I'm in Gitmo.
• @"Sarah McBride set her video endorsing the AUSA to the John Adams theme music?  Self-inflated much?"  I doubt Sarah McBride edited her own video.
• @"Why are Texans at this school so hot?!?!"
You staring at those Texasses, too? #Terrific #KONY2013
• Why can't you just like me?
• @ guys picking a library spot- Coming from a girl's perspective, I would defintely be distracted but still attempt to study while taking quick glances at said attractive guy. Simply smiling at the girl would work. If you're brave enough you could always go up to her and just say hi and strike up a conversation via passing notes like the good ol middle school days.

The undeniable appeal of the scandalous underground. The historical significance of love in Nazi Germany. A pineapple. The foundations for great theater? Indeed.
The Keegan Theatre has ushered in an upbeat new era of its history with a spectacular production of the classic musical “Cabaret.” The troubled romances, iconic songs and adventurous stage acts remain intact in this iteration, but with several extravagant twists. This unique interpretation complements its cadre of female dancers with promiscuous male counterparts—including an AU student, School of Communication and College of Arts and Sciences junior Matt Rubbelke. 
The play also incorporates the Emcee as an omnipresent force and even invites intermittent participation from the audience to complicate the proceedings.
Directed by Christina Coakley and Michael Innocenti with a book by Joe Masteroff, “Cabaret” offers conventional entertainment value as well as several darker themes which punctuate and deepen the spectacle. The result is an experience that stimulates the heart and the mind in equal measure.
Set in 1920s Berlin, the plot revolves around a seedy nightclub in Germany, run by the complex, baffling, flamboyant Emcee (Paul Scanlan) and headlined by the feisty English singer Sally Bowles (Maria Rizzo). The arrival of struggling American writer Clifford Bradshaw (Bradley Foster Smith) throws the nightclub into chaos — Sally falls in love with him, while his landlord Fraulein Schneider (Jane Petkofsky) discovers herself drawn to a Jewish man named Herr Schulz (Stan Shulman), despite the burgeoning stigma attached to such attraction.
This play explores the emotional truth beneath the façade of performance. The Emcee’s attitudes and costumes frequently reflect the evolving tone of the character arcs even when his lyrics suggest otherwise. As Cliff begins to realize that a service to his friend has been indirectly supporting the Nazi regime, Sally experiences personal difficulties of her own, struggling to find an identity and overcome a drug problem. The Emcee remains a presence throughout the other characters’ journeys, dangling a piece of fruit during a tender moment between Herr Schulz and Fraulein Schneider and lingering on a nearby staircase during another tense interaction.
The direction eschews elaborate set changes for the simple rearrangement of a few plain chairs, allowing the audience to focus on the character relationships. Despite the subtlety of the transitions, the audience never questions the location of a scene. 
Nonetheless, every corner of the stage provides drama, as the actors ascend onto a tall platform and occupy a bench far stage left during another.  
Meanwhile, the performances dazzle with range and emotional commitment. Rizzo in particular demonstrates spectacular command of her character’s buoyancy. Meanwhile, her wrenching delivery of the eponymous song establishes her impressive range. Rizzo’s Sally lights up every room, but her own heart ironically remains dark.
Elsewhere, Scanlan’s relative youth compared to other actors in this part suggests contrasting elements of melancholy wisdom and unfortunate naivete. The supporting players, particularly Stan Shulman as the confused but decent Herr Schulz, provide luminous support. Cooper, on the other hand, constitutes the cast’s arguable weak link. His performance lacks dimension; the character is a sad sack with few redeeming qualities. Without the perspective of a happier Cliff, the character feels hollow rather than complex.
This gripe is fairly minor, though, in a production rich with pleasures. The Keegan’s “Cabaret” provides a wholly satisfying theatrical experience, inspiring deep laughter and attachment to the characters while presenting an abundance of emotions and thematic questions to ponder on the way out. As Sally exclaims during the climax, “Come to the Cabaret!”
“Cabaret” will run at the Keegan Theatre until March 2.

This past week, AU held a town hall meeting about creating and/or changing the dining options on campus. The Quick Take columnists address student concerns and give suggestions regarding the introduction of new dining options on campus for the 2013-2014 school year.

Broader selection of food establishments would benefit campus
By Emma Gray
AU’s dining options have always been a topic of contention for students. The thought of trying anything new in TDR turns off picky students. People with dietary restrictions can’t find the food that they need. Nothing is open past 2 a.m. to fuel late night study sessions. For the most part, these are small issues that are being resolved where they can be.
Even as a vegetarian, I find AU’s food offerings to be more than enough to fill my stomach and keep me studying. However, my only major concern is Bon Appétit’s monopoly on the campus. I have no doubt this is in some way related to the contract the company has signed with the school, but I would like to see a broader variety of food ownership on-campus choices. The key is to find out where people are going off-campus and bring that here.
For example, a popular chain restaurant would be a great addition to AU’s campus and could hold its own against Bon Appétit establishments. Everyone knows that Chipotle is better than the copycat, Salsa. Why would you order pizza from Tenleytown when they could make them fresh right here? Even another sub shop like Quizno’s or a Dunkin Donuts to challenge all of the white Starbucks cups would be a welcome change.
Something that would fill a major void at AU would be a place for students to watch popular sporting events. I can’t ask for a sports bar on a dry campus, but I’m envisioning something similar. The Tavern tries to accomplish this with its projection screen, but it only show games every so often and can’t accommodate when two games coincide with one another. A smaller setting with multiple screens and an all-American menu would do well among a student body deprived of a NCAA football team.
Bon Appétit does well as the major food provider at AU, and I support its more ethical food standards. It may take a while, but I think that loosening the company’s stronghold to allow room for other food establishments in the coming years would be both beneficial to the AU community and impressive to prospective students as well.

More dining options needed for more students
By Pete Bailey
With the closure of Tenley campus next year, more students will reside on-campus, which has raised concerns about the current dining options available. 
These concerns are extremely valid. Currently, all freshmen must purchase a minimum of a 150-block meal plan each semester. While this may seem to be enough for most freshmen, the only three venues that will accept meal swipes next year are Terrace Dining Room, The Tavern, Salsa and Eagle Express.
TDR is the main dining location where most students go for their meals. However, during regular dining hours, TDR has a line that overflows into the Mary Graydon Center due to the traffic and admittance process. Once inside, there is very limited seating. Without Tenley campus’ dining hall, the number of students trying to cram into TDR will surely exceed the establishment’s capacity.
Some may argue that students’ access to the swipe-accessible Tavern would reduce the crowd at TDR. While this is true, The Tavern has the least healthy food on campus. Deep-fried chicken tenders dripping in grease may sound great to a hung-over freshman at first, but eventually The Tavern’s food will seem more like enforced weight gain than a legitimate dining option.  
The final place where students can use a meal swipe is Eagle Express’ boxed lunch option. These pre-packaged sandwiches, containing more preservatives than calories, are always a last resort for anyone dining on campus. Eagle Express is not an ideal place to purchase a $8/swipe meal. Not only is the dollar-value of a swipe far greater than the quantity of food a student receives at Eagle Express, but also the quality of the sandwiches is extremely low.
With TDR as the only relatively healthy place to use a meal swipe on campus, next year’s dining program must be changed. These changes should include more places to use the mandatory meal swipes, such as the nine other venues; including Einstein Brothers Bagels, Greens, MegaBytes Café, Pronto and Eagle’s Nest, all of which currently do not accept swipes. If a student could use a meal swipe at these venues, it would drastically improve the dining program.
It is also important that campus establishments operate on college students’ schedules.
It is widely known that a typical college student will stay awake far past 10 p.m. Whether students are returning to campus late from a night out or pulling an all-nighter in the library before finals, there needs to be a place where students can find food. Last year, AU got rid of its 24-hour McDonalds. While McDonalds is not exactly the healthiest place to eat, it was nice to be able to rely on the restaurant when it was 3 a.m. and a student needed a cheap meal.
AU needs to keep its students in mind while it determines the dining program changes. Meal plans are a large expense for students and currently the options are not worth the meal plan. Next year, campus will have a larger on-campus population than ever before, and the current dining program cannot efficiently feed that many mouths.

Let us not forget AU's dining services workers

Word on campus is that change is in the wind for AU students, or at least greatly desired. Specifically, change for the dining programs and options offered on campus.
More options and services could certainly be the topic of discussion in the very near future. However, beforehand, we should be discussing a more pressing matter at hand: What about the Bon Appétit employees?
Living, studying and eating at one of the most expensive tertiary education facilities in the country should be considered a privilege that one is afforded via good fortune and the diligence of those that maintain the facility. 
By my estimation, TDR has left very little to be desired in terms of services and food offered. For a school cafeteria, the food is generally well-made (considering it is made in bulk), the staff are hard working and generally helpful. As for variety, the Firewok and Comfort Food section both strive to offer a bevy of different dishes from different cultures. One should very much doubt that every AU student had tasted coq au vin or London broil before coming here.
To maintain such conditions, it would behoove those interested in even better services and options in dining to remember that it is necessary to assure the quality of already-existing services and options. But as everybody knows, workers who are bullied into accepting low wages and poor job security do not perform well.
Those of the student body who have been active in social justice and workers’ advocacy activities on campus know too well that the University’s policies (and those of its contractors) toward recompense for labor and labor organization are unfriendly. This needs to change before we can attempt to change food quality.

I don’t like our Student Government. I don’t want to pay into a system designed to pit friends against friends, which treats the students like a problem and the student voice like a commodity. 
I want to help people; to use our stake in the process to do some actual good.  
The issues we face at AU today have never been greater, but there is a solution. 
On Feb. 11, we can vote yes on Question 1, dissolving the SG and making way for the new AU Student Association.
We can all agree that our fellow students have a right to be heard and that we all deserve the very finest advocate for our interests. That’s why people on both sides of the debate, inside and outside SG, worked tirelessly over the summer to draft this new constitution. 
This was an open process, with open applications, public meetings and extensive coverage in The Eagle. More importantly, this committee believed what we believe, that we deserve effective student advocates who are unafraid to stand up to the administration and help everyone interested in making this school even more excellent. 
The creation of the AUSA underscores something we should have realized years ago: We are not insiders, we are not outsiders; we are students. We all want the same things: low tuition for the best degree, good food served by respected workers on a living wage and a union of students focused not on internal policy-making but in a shared mission to do good.
The changes proposed by the new constitution do more than rename our political fixtures under a new logo. They have been modeled after some of the best practices in the nation. They eliminate the needless politics of the Judicial Board and tame the Board of Elections. The Undergraduate Senate would be no more, replaced by a Board of Representatives that would actually work with the executives, not fight them. It is a system which benefits those interested in actual student advocacy and limits the opportunity for others to play their political games.
What we do today has a great bearing on the future of this institution. We cannot afford another year of argument, division, obstruction and frustration. We deserve a unified student voice, a better system, not tomorrow, not a year down the line, but today. It is our duty, it is our right. By virtue of paying tuition at this institution, we are entitled to the very finest advocate for our collective interest. The AUSA is that advocate.
Please, go to your AU Portal on Feb. 11 and vote yes on Question 1.

• The only places I know of that support women's only gym hours are in countries where women are expected to cover their hair and bodies to prevent men from taking advantage of them. I am a woman who used to be incredibly insecure, but I freaking grew some ovaries and got strong as sh!t. Now *I* intimidate *men* at the gym. Grow up or get out. 
• People please, get over yourselves. Someone asking you to think about how what you wear can affect other people is not an attack on your free speech. No one is forcing you to change your clothing. However, if you use your free speech to wear something that is mysoginistic, I (as well is the rest of the community we live in) will exercise our right to call you mysoginistic douchebags. Can't we just go back to ranting about whoever died in Downton or whatever the hell kids are watching these days?
• why did everyone only take away "omg women's only gym hours" from that op-ed? you're ignoring the important parts of the piece. p.s. sexism against men doesn't exist plz cry more
• "@We need to get rid of Black history month once and for all. All it leads to is more white guilt and blacks feeling superior. I freaking hate it....
With a comment like that, we definitely need to keep it. "
• @ "House of Cards kicks ass.  I found it today and watched the first seven episodes in a row." --- here's what bothers me: Kate Mara/Robin Wright do NOT equal Kevin Spacey in terms of physical attraction. I know he's a powerful, ambitious politician with a Southern accent and all, but COME ON. 
• Being white and being mostly attracted to white people doesn't make someone racist.. people are attracted to whom they're attracted, and can't really help it (at all). Personally, I'm a white girl and I don't tend to be attracted to people of other races. It's not because I'm racist, because obviously I've seen attractive people of every race, it's just that I tend to find white guys more attractive. I can't help it, that's just how I am. Maybe that'll change one day, but not yet.
• I'm not a girl and I'll admit when it comes to feminism I only absorb what it is the professors and friends tell me about it, plus being raised by two fairly liberal hard working parents seems to make me think I'm a moderate so I'll say this having women-only hours at the gym to me seems like a step backwards for women's rights, I mean I remember about fifty years or so ago when activists wanted to ban the whites-only bathrooms and water fountains. I'm just saying equality means everyone regardless of race, color, creed, and GENDER.
• Why are Texans at this school so hot?!?!
• People that check themselves out in the Capitol One ATM's mirror by Megabytes >
• What is the best website to find events in and around DC? - I've signed up on Websites like LinkTank & I get the AU Daily email. (as well as emails from specific organizations) but anyone kow of another comprehensive list? (For talks and speakers) 
• Bro, do you even yar har fiddely dee?
• tfw no qt3.14 gf
• so many feels
• If we had all male gym hours, no women would be harassed either.
• I'm pretty sure the average straight white-male has a pretty strong case of yellow fever.
• @Women only gym hours is just going too far.  Agreed.  If we are accepting of both genders, then giving preferential hours to women is discriminatory, and its completely unfair.  Let's make a Men's Initiative to balance out the Women's Initiative and keep gym hours the same- unless you make both men and women gym hours....but that wouldn't be inclusive.  Give me a break
• Any other guys pick a spot in the library b/c an attractive girl is at that table alone, but even if u could think of something to say w/o seeming creepy, it's the silent floor, so she's there to study, probably not chit chat? Girls, thoughts pls? If an attractive guy chose to sit at the table u were at alone, would u just keep studying? Can the girls suggest a reasonable approach? Any expectable hints? Even advice like "silent floor off limits"?
• Dying for some stress relieving sex, like actually dying
• @ "If I ever meet someone who expresses such disregard and apathy towards free speech and private property which are appearing on the above comment, I will literally castrate them, regardless of gender." THIS! Thank you! I hate the hypocrisy that runs rampant at this school. Free speech is only allowed if it doesn't offend anyone. Too bad all these butthurt people are so catered to at AU in a way that just makes them worse. 
• ATV news anchor you're so sexy
• To the girls who can't help but gossip on library silent floor, thanks for whispering HALF the time but seriously this is the SILENT floor. NOT the GOSSIP floor. You want to gossip? Please, PLEASE just go to the MUDBOX. I don't want to be rude and call you out but I will if I must. 
• I honestly hate this school. Someone once told me that unless you're in greek life here you'll have no social life. That sadly is true and the worst part is the sororities are fake and who wants to pay for fake friends? Is there any way to make friends here? I didn't know I was coming into 4 years of high school like cliques...
• Wow, guys. Just...wow. 
• I kinda thought we had a thing until you hooked up with another girl this weekend. Charming. 
• 11:15pm and no rants for feb 10th...so much for consistent timing huh editor...can u give us an avg time to expect rants at this rate? And perhaps attempt to stick to it? Maybe a 
reminder on your phone? 
[Editor’s Note: I accidentally deleted the reminder on my phone. But it’s back and set to go off at 7:30]
• No rants makes me sad
• Sarah McBride set her video endorsing the AUSA to the John Adams theme music?  Self-inflated much?
• I said something today that I didn't really believe.  It was a harmless lie, just to make someone happy.  But it was a lie, and I hate not being honest.  I should have followed my instinct.
• @ "• Violent t-shirts???  OH NOES!  These t-shirts are violent!"
T is the first letter of Tommy. And Tommy is a common nickname for a gun called the "Tommy Gun" and Johnny Cash, Bob Hope, and Steve Jobs were alive around the time they were still used which was around 10 years ago. But now we have No Cash, No Hope, and No Jobs.
• I often stare at the toilets in Men's bathrooms and wonder what kind of beast can take a dump that destructive and not be able to flush in between cramming as much toilet paper into a toilet as possible and a dump so utterly obliterating that it actually becomes sort of a modernist expression of current culture. 
• Seems someone broke the editor...
• I read the opinion article by Kendra Lee and thought she was right. An idiot wearing a shirt proclaiming he's an idiot and should be avoided. Lee skimped on how words can affect people (it would have helped her argument), BUT, OH SO BUT, then I read the comments and discovered I go to school with a bunch of f-ing idiots. Everyone in that comment section is utterly risible. 
• @ I’m watching through BTVS for the first time and I just have to ask.. is Dawn supposed to be annoying as f**k? I swear to god, I want to slap her in every episode she’s in.
Ugh I know, right...totally agreed. But granted, she does get a little better in Season 7.

Former AU basketball player Charles Hinkle will be blogging throughout the season while playing for Kis-Raba menti Takarek Soproni Kc in the Hungary-A Division. Hinkle’s new squad is just three games out of first place. Hinkle has played in one game since recently joining the team. Submit questions to sports@theeagleonline.com for Hinkle to answer in future blogs.
Szia from Hungary,
After spending 5 months in Istanbul, my career has taken an unexpected turn as I have changed teams and now play for Soproni which is located in Sopron, Hungary. 
So far, my first year as a professional basketball player has been a roller coaster, but one I do cherish. Few have played basketball internationally. But for the people who have, my season is typical for a first year player.
As explained through talks with coach Jeff Jones after my senior season about going forward professionally, I learned that my career might not always be smooth sailing from the beginning. My first job, like my stint in Turkey, is one to get my feet wet, so to speak. It is an opportunity to get experience on my resume and to show other teams that I can not only handle myself on the court, but off as well.
With the overall experience, I loved Istanbul. I was given a three bedroom apartment which I shared with my American teammate, Kervin Bristol, who graduated from Fordham University. We not only played against each other during my first year of eligibility in the Cable Car Classic Tournament held by Santa Clara University, in which AU won, but we were also paired to play on the same team for a tryout this past summer for a team in Israel, which was held in Florida.
The two foreigners, Bristol and I, immediately showed a presence on the court and showed what we were brought in to do. Within the first couple of games, I was top five in the league in scoring and Bristol was top three in both rebounds and blocked shots, but our performances on the court were falling short of getting wins. Compared to all the other teams in the league, my team was one of the youngest in the league and it was evident.
In the majority of the games, my team was either winning, tied or within a four-point margin in the fourth quarter. Most of those games we lost. The team’s morale quickly dwindled and the general manager of the team decided it was best to go with a new coach in early December. 
Although the new coach began implementing new strategies, those too failed as my team fell to a disappointing 3-14 record. By this time, everyone was frustrated with the results of the games.
Throughout the season I would come in before and stay long after for just about every practice. Often I would envision coach Jones telling me to stop working out during the season and rest my body like he often did during my stay at AU, but the constant losses drove me away from those desires. Still nothing was changing, and my team continued to lose.  
It was around early January when I got a call from my agent that a team in Hungary wanted to sign me. He told me that the team was in a race for the top spot of the conference and that the player I would be replacing suffered an injury, and the team needed to fill the role immediately. He told me that if I performed like I did in Turkey, it would look great on my resume because it is against stiffer competition. Being excited for this great news, I was all but ready to pack my bags. But the team in Turkey had to be willing to release me.
After a couple of talks between the team and my agent, I finally got the release, which brings me here to this very moment. The competitive nature in anyone, let alone an athlete, is extremely high as is evident between the changes in mood when you go from a team that is at the bottom of the league to a team that is competing for a top seed in the playoffs. Everyone is much happier and I feel extremely blessed to be put in this scenario and given another chance to win a championship.
Only being in the country for a couple days, I have not seen much. The best way to describe the city is to compare it to an old British town that you would see in the movies. 
I was a drastic change. Where the team in Turkey would sometimes not practice, now I have two-a-day practices nearly every day. Although the practices run an hour and 45 minutes at most, I am finally able to get my legs under me and am getting used to the change in routine.
The team initially put me up in a hotel until the house where I would stay was available, and the first morning I woke up breakfast was being served. A sweet scent permeated the air and I sped across the hallway to reach the familiar smell. 
BACON!!!! 
For those who do not know, Turkey is a Muslim country, and pork is forbidden. Bacon, sausage, ribs and everything else that my stomach had missed so much is now available in Hungary… 
I guess you can say Hungary is serving my appetite quite well.

A man locked himself inside the University darkroom in the Mary Graydon Center on Feb. 6 and was later apprehended by Public Safety, according to the Manager of Photographic Services Kaitlin Whitman.
Public Safety banned the man from campus on the Quad, said Maralee Csellar, associate director of media relations, in an email to The Eagle.
The man had entered and locked himself in the the photography lab, Whitman said.
The man wore bright blue and yellow clothing and had a dollar bill tattoo under his eye, Andrew Dean, a senior in the School of Communication and photography lab staff member, said. The man was African-American, about 5-feet-6-inches and in his 20s. 
The man peered into rooms and looked lost, Dean said. Then, Dean heard a door shut when he turned the corner to go into the photography office. Afterward, Dean told Whitman a suspicious man was in the darkroom, and Whitman went to check the darkroom.
The door to the darkroom was locked when Whitman reached it, she said. When she unlocked the door the man was inside, Whitman said.
“He claimed to be from Howard University and said he was looking for a film lecture or a class,” Whitman said.
The man left the darkroom after he was approached. Whitman called Public Safety and officers apprehended the man on-campus around 3:45 p.m., she said.
