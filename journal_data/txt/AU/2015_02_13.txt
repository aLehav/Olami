KRISTIN DOS SANTOS, FLICKR
Note: The following recap contains spoilers for season seven, episodes eight and nine of “Parks and Recreation,” entitled “Ms. Ludgate-Dwyer Goes to Washington” and “Pie-Mary.”
Barbara Boxer. John McCain. Cory Booker. MADELEINE ALBRIGHT. Just a few of the famous political figures to show up in this week’s “Parks and Recreation” episode.
Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler, “Mean Girls”) and April Ludgate-Dwyer (Aubrey Plaza, “Safety Not Guaranteed”) go to Washington, D.C. on business for the National Parks Service.
Before leaving, April talks to her husband, Andy Dwyer, (Chris Pratt, “Guardians of the Galaxy”), Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott, “Friends With Kids”) and Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman, “Gilmore Girls”) about her future. Completely unsure of what she wants to do, Andy, Ben and Ron set out to find her her dream job, which must include creatively solving problems and not caring if people like her.
While in D.C., with increasing pressure from Leslie, April finally breaks down and tells her she doesn’t see a future in government. After a brief blow-up and waffles with Albright, Leslie knows what to do.
April finds her dream job - in D.C. - as does Leslie: she’s up for the position of deputy director of Operations of the Interior.
Back in Pawnee, Ben works with Jennifer Barkley (Kathryn Hahn, “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty”) on his Congressional campaign. With just too many things to do in too little time, Ben and Leslie decide to cut some things out of his busy schedule, including the Pie-Mary Baking Contest between the candidates’ wives.
Women’s rights and men’s rights groups alike are outraged at the Wyatt-Knope’s decisions. Protests ensue. Ben and Leslie tell them how it is.
Stray thoughts…
*I would buy “The Feminine Mesquite.”
*JERRY’S REDEMPTION. Donna and Jerry have been developing their relationship even more over the past few episodes and it’s been really sweet. Basically, he’s finally getting treated with more respect.
* “TED! BEN’S HERE!”
*”Boom! Pancho!” Brilliant.
*Only Leslie Knope and Madeleine Albright would be able to get into Lincoln’s Waffle Shop without a huge wait.
*The Great Scavenger Hunt 2k17 with Ron and April. April hid Ron’s spare house key a little too well. Luckily for them, Ron changes his locks every 16 days.
Tune in to “Parks and Recreation,” Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on NBC.
