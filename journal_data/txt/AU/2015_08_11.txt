Former Kogod School of Business Dean Herbert Striner died on Aug. 7, according to a memo sent to the AU community today. 
Striner headed the school from 1975 to 1981 when it was called the School of Business Administration, according to the message sent by Mary Clark, the current Dean of Academic Affairs. The school added Master’s of Science programs in eight fields and expanded its Master’s of Business Administration program in that time. It was renamed after D.C. real estate mogul and alumnus Robert Kogod in the last year of Striner’s tenure. 
“Under his leadership, SBA enjoyed an exceptional period of entrepreneurial energy in the development of its business curricula,” Clark said in the statement.
Striner was also an artist and in 2007 donated more than 8,000 photos to AU. He began taking photos during his service in WWII, and works in the collection spanned from 1945 to 1999. 
  Information on the memorial service will be released when available, the memo said.
