Student Government is advocating for a tuition increase to cover necessary University costs. 
SG also endorsed raising the proportion of tuition that is spent on financial aid and asked for more budget transparency, according to their report on the University budget released this morning.
Students currently pay 81 percent of AU’s budget, according to the University Budget. The rest of the revenue comes from housing and dining fees and donations. 
The SG Commission on University Budget Policy, which consists of six SG members, released the report this morning in preparation for the town hall with the Board of Trustees and President Neil Kerwin on Nov. 15 at 5:30 p.m. in Ward 1.
SG President Emily Yu, Comptroller Joe Ste.Marie, former Comptroller Eric Reath, Co-Directors of the University Budget Policy David Horowitz and Tiana Lane, and Class of 2015 Sen. Patrick Kelly sit on the Commission.
Marginal tuition increases
SG chose not to advocate for a tuition freeze because of the financial challenges it may bring to the University, Ste.Marie said.
“We are not advocating for fixed tuition because we think it hurts student interests and we don’t think it’s achievable,” Ste. Marie said.
If the University does not raise tuition during this budget cycle, it could force the University to raise tuition even higher in the next budget cycle to recoup losses. The University could also face millions of dollars in cuts if there is no tuition increase, Ste.Marie said.
SG believes that cutting administration salaries would not replace a tuition increase because the administration salaries are not worth enough to cover the amount needed to cover University costs, Ste. Marie said.
“[Administration] are paid less than 1 percent of the budget,” Reath said.
Professor salaries would also have to be cut in order to meet the amount needed for a tuition freeze, Ste.Marie said
SG: Higher discount rate will benefit students
Currently, for every dollar paid toward tuition 29 cents goes to financial aid, Yu said. Ste.Marie said SG would like to see that proportion, called the tuition discount rate, raised to 30 percent.
SG said in the report that a low discount rate is bad for students, because the higher the discount rate the larger the pool of available financial aid. 
A higher tuition discount rate could also result in a larger tuition increase, but the amount of financial aid would also increase, Ste.Marie said.
The University recently switched 10 percent of its financial aid from merit-based to need-based aid, The Eagle previously reported.
With more money for financial aid, both need-based and merit-based scholarships would increase, Reath said.
Students’ rights to know 
SG’s final point calls for more transparency on the budget.
SG believes more attention is needed to explain where student money goes in the budget, but it does not believe a list of every purchase is needed, Ste.Marie said.
“More transparency on personnel costs, financial aid, and more detailed unit budgets,” according to the report, “would allow students to better understand how their tuition dollars are being spent.”

• @Spanish speakers: Judging from every other Eagle Rants page I've ever seen, talking on the quiet floor knows no language barriers.
• So I have a bit of a crush on this girl I know. Know I should proceed with flirting, hoping my self-confidence doesn't give out and make me abandon this thing. Also the first letter of her first name is J
• Not sure which is more pathetic, the fact that I have nothing to do with my saturday night than be on my laptop or that this is actually an average saturday night for me
• That awkward moment when everyone thinks The CAUS is spamming Eagle Rants with pro-CAUS rants, despite the fact that no CAUS members have actually submitted Eagle Rants. But then again, I guess every piece of information that doesn't fit your narrow worldview that protesting is bad must be summarily ignored.
• Um.  So.  I'm a girl who likes a girl who has a boyfriend.  Delusional?
• I HAVE A BIG HEAD AND LITTLE ARMS
I'M JUST NOT SURE HOW WELL THIS PLAN WAS THOUGHT THROUGH
MASTER??
• My greatest fear occurred, a bug crawled down my leg.
• Sports at AU kind of suck. THERE I SAID IT!
P.S.
Play the sport because you enjoy it, not to get recognition.
• Can you meet me in front of SIS at 11:45 Monday night? Thanks cutie ;) 
• We know each other, and we exchange pleasantries when we see each other. I REALLY like your friend. I want you to hook us up. Be a real bro and make this gay relationship happen.
• Dear lamb...good things come to those who wait indeed. Keep being awesome...and stop reading eagle rants and get back to work!
• Thank you, veterans. 
• @Ya naaaaasssssssty. | Was this a Simon and Martina reference? 'Cause if so, you rock. 
• have the house to myself so chill!
• @"hopefully I didn’t make it awkward last night. I know you have a boyfriend, but you’re cute and I’m cute, so we should get together soon." You should probably give more clues as to who this is meant for...
• To all the vets out there, while I may not always agree that war is the answer, I have nothing but utmost respect for you. We civilians may not always show it, but I for one thank you from the bottom of my heart for your service. I am now and forever will be indebted to you. 
• @"America's spear": Why do people think it's cool to glorify violence? America shouldn't be spearing people with wars and killing innocent civilians, thus creating more enemies for America, not to mention pain, death, and destruction for other citizens of the world. How about we try helping each other by eradicating disease and poverty.
• I keep having dreams that I give birth to a baby and then abandon her.  What does this mean? I would never adandom my future baby. I love babies and can't wait to have them. What's with the creepy dreams? :(
• I keep fantasizing about my boyfriend's best friend. I wouldn't never cheat on my boyfriend. But sometimes I wish the best friend would just rape me. Am I messed up in the head for wanting that? 
• relationships are so hard. but when it's worth it, you fight hard to love the other person in the way they deserve. it's exhausting, but it's beautiful, and each season of pain eventually passes. this is why i don't understand open marriage girl. you deserve someone who WANTS to love you in the way you need. that's the person you should spend your life with.
• does anyone else stay up studying until they hear a break in their roommate's snoring? because good lord this child snores loud. ain't no way i can go to sleep while she's foghorning! 
• Someone made a queer of the quad tumblr... The ofthequad urls need to stop
• Clarification. Your tuition dollars go to his SALARY, with which he can do whatever he pleases. Honestly, CAUS is literally comprised of the stupidest people I know. 
• Because this got censored: if you want tuition to stop raising, stop expecting nice things like more green initiatives, new buildings, better salary for faculty/staff, better professors, more club support, dorm renovations. If you want the experience at AU to keep improving, tuition has to get raised. Stop being selfish and only thinking about yourselves- think about the rest of the community and the students to come. Hate to break it to you, CAUS, but money doesn't grow on trees, and your antics aren't helping our endowment...
• I have no idea what this person next to me at the library is doing. They are rubbing their pen vigorously on a cinder block. Are they trying to sharpen it? I don't understand
• okay good they stopped. that was really annoying
• @"SCREW YOU UBUNTU" come to SFC meetings, we'll help you work on it. We need members anyway.
• Obama raises taxes, plays lip service to gay rights, talks a good show, arrests protestors outside of his door, does nothing, has a MILF wife.  Has a noble prize. 
Kerwin rasies tuition, plays lip service to gay rights, talks a good show, arrests protestors outside of his door, does nothing, has a GILF wife. Does not have a noble prize.
We just need to nominate Kerwin for a Noble Prize and he could be president. 
• @lunch date/first letter: B
• to the person ranting about spanish speakers at au: porque son puros hijos de mami y papi...except the u.s. latino kids
• We don't have Veteran's Day off, wtaf is this?
• To all the veterans here at AU, thank you for all you have done defending our country. I know many of you have made sacrifices none of us here back at home could handle and yet you keep on going on. You are a constant source of inspiration, so thank you again.
• Dear Curly-Haired Freshman Boy Who Modeled in the AKA Fashion Show, you are beautiful.
• Apparently, Darth Vader is the editor of Eagle Rants. "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVEMBER!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
• @"everyone responding to Liberals R. Tools: DFT—Don’t Feed the Troll."  B*tch please.  You liberals cant help but get yourselves in a tiff over supposed "injustices" and non-issues.  That is the liberal nature - and why you manage to destroy everything good about the country.  
• @"Liberals R. Tools” You are an ignorant child.  But I forgive you.  You know not what you do."  Nice try, schmuck.  You idiots have backrupted the country and turned the USA into upper-Mexico.  Don't even try to take the moral highground here, you pretentious tool.
• Wait I'm too lazy to go back and find out who E.J. and M are.  Are people from here actually gonna get together?! GOOD LUCK IF YOU TWO FOLLOW THROUGH! :)
• JUST KIDDING. I was too curious. To Texas boy: if you meet her, I'll give you the biggest bro hug ever. that's awesome.  To cutie White House girl: OMG HE FOUND YOU!! have fun you two :P
• The 20 or so core members of the CAUS are the same people involved in the new campaign to get better pay for the TDR workers and more benefits.  Welcome to the real world kiddos.  If you don't want tuition increases you can't demand additional costs that don't matter to most students.
• @ Niel Kerwin selling his house: Soooo..... are you implying that Kerwin's house costs millions of dollars in maintenance every year? That place must be HUGE!
• @ Brace yourselves, the CAUS reply rants are coming…
HAHAHAHA! I literally lol'd. I overheard them conspiring to write reply rants earlier which made this even funnier
• Dear Freshman Senator: Please realize that people don't care about your facebook statuses involving every single aspect of the undergrad senate... in fact, we think you're a worse person for even being part of that West Wing-wannabe place where dignity/friends/social standing goes to die... 
• Dear "lonely lady": don't say you're not attractive. Every girl is beautiful in her own way! I'd love to meet up with you!
• @"Hey you. I know you rant almost every day so I know you will read this": I miss you too. Let's talk soon. I want you back in my life!
• I just want to know the first letter in the girl's name who you almost asked out; because it may be my friend, and if so, she likes you too!
• "Yeah I'm trying. It's weird when they've moved on but you haven't.": I feel the same way hahaha! Hang in there, there's someone amazing waiting for both of us! :)
• "Can we start talking again?": I've got no idea if this is meant for me, but if it is, yes! I've really missed you!
• @"I agree! Forget the student government and hall councils, you're right!": Let's seriously get on this!
• “Yeah Obama authorized drone strikes which killed civilians and children. Its a tragedy.": actually it's more than simply tragic. This President who prematurely received the Nobel Peace Prize has repeatedly violated Pakistani sovereignty and international law. Also, as to Romney taking us back 50 years: if moving "Forward" means killing hundreds of innocent men, women and children in the name of national security, please send me back to the 50s or 60s!!
• @"I agree! Forget the student government and hall councils, you're right!": Let's seriously get on this!
• @"I just want to be with someone": Me too! SERIOUSLY AU singles speed dating needs to happen. I refuse to believe that I can't meet a wonderful, brilliant and beautiful girl here!
• SO. MUCH. SEXUAL. TENSION. @cute girl in Colonial Latin America
• I see dead people. Seriously for real. So many dead people.
• I'm so done with caring about you. I hope you die screaming.
