The Office of Information Technology renamed the connect2eaglesecure wireless network to WirelessSetupAU at 5 p.m. on Jan. 10.
The network used to initially connect to the main campus Wi-Fi, eaglesecure, was renamed to sound more recognizable, according to an email from OIT. 
The name change will make it easier to access available wireless networks for devices that connect in alphabetical order. 
Students who have already connected their computers to the eaglesecure wireless network can continue to connect as usual. However, some devices including game consoles, e-readers and wireless DVD players may need to be reconfigured to connect to the WirelessSetupAU network, according to OIT.
Further instructions can be found on the AU website.
