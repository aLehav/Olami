“We may lose the small battles, but win the big war.” 
Mildred Loving’s words, as relayed in the marvelous new film Loving, come at a time of immense turmoil: a week that featured the election of a man who has more than flirted with white nationalism and the eruption of protests across the country, including at AU. The national mood is a mix of tumultuous, fearful, angry, pessimistic. Loving is none of those things, and perhaps that’s why it strikes a chord. 
The movie follows the story of Richard and Mildred Loving, a couple who have recently wed in segregationist Virginia in the late 1950s. From the very beginning, you can tell that Rich and Mildred are not your typical newlyweds. Outside of their different skin colors  -- Rich is white, Mildred is black and part Cherokee -- it’s clear that Rich (played by Joel Edgerton of The Great Gatsby and Zero Dark Thirty) is comfortable laughing, eating and living with Mildred’s black family and friends. Unlike most white people in their rural town, Rich does not look down upon black folks, instead embracing Mildred’s fulfilling family life and keeping a safe distance from his silently disapproving mother.
Rich is also an immensely proud man. He knows that white Virginians might frown upon his marriage to Mildred, and yet he still nails up their marriage certificate in on the wall of their tiny bedroom. While Rich seems impossibly oblivious to the potential legal implications of their marriage, the pride he takes in his union with Mildred, who he calls “String Bean,” fills the film with a love that is felt rather than said aloud. Even under so much strain and judgment from both the white and black communities around him, Rich’s passion for Mildred and their life together never fails him, though words often do. 
And then there’s Mildred. Played by the relatively unknown Ruth Negga (World War Z), Mildred is the quiet hero of her family’s story. Once the Lovings are arrested for violating anti-miscegenation laws and banned from living in Virginia together, Mildred is forced to leave her tightly woven social circle in the country for an unknown future in Washington, D.C. 
From the get-go, Mildred knows she wants out of the city and gets the idea to contact Robert Kennedy, the attorney general at the time, for legal help. He refers her to the American Civil Liberties Union, which takes on her case -- for free. Their case ends up making it to the Supreme Court, becoming one of the landmark civil rights victories in American history. Negga, who bears striking resemblance to the real-life Mildred, gives her character an easy grace and ferocity that contrasts with Rich’s reluctance to put his family out there for others to judge. It's clear that Mildred will do whatever it takes to attain the life her family deserves. 
Loving’s strengths are also sources of potential weaknesses. It’s a slow-moving film, more concerned with body language and character development than with dramatic court scenes. For some, that might elicit yawns, but for others, the film shines in its attention to detail and genuine care for its characters. At times Loving’s strain for comic relief becomes frustrating, though Nick Kroll (Kroll Show, The League) does provide some real laughs as one of the ACLU lawyers. I spent most of his scenes wondering how Kroll got cast in such a dramatic role, only to find his comedic timing coming through. 
However, it’s truly difficult to find faults in Loving. Perhaps I am a bit biased -- my grandparents, who played a major role in raising me, were married in the late 1960s amidst the Loving verdict. He was a young Mexican-American football player from Texas, she the daughter of white farmers in Nebraska. Though they like to pretend everything was peachy, their story mirrors the Lovings in important ways: an unexpected pregnancy, a marriage in another state, a not-so-lavish living situation that came together without fanfare. I could not watch this movie without the constant reminder that my grandparents’ path was made easier by the bravery and strength of the Lovings. 
Loving depicts the pursuit of an American dream circumvented by uniquely American laws. The product is the most American of stories: a couple overcoming the odds, quietly and with purpose. Sure, it’s idealistic and looks at history with rose-colored glasses. But don't tell me our country couldn’t use some of that right about now.

The AU men’s soccer team faced a similar situation to their first matchup against the Bucknell Bison on Friday afternoon. On Oct. 22, the Eagles trailed the Bison 1-0 at halftime and proceeded to force overtime and eventually win 3-2. In their second matchup with Bucknell this season, the Eagles hosted the semifinal match in the Patriot League tournament and again trailed at halftime. AU once again overcame the halftime deficit to force overtime and secure both a 2-1 victory and a place in the Patriot League championship game on Sunday.
The first half of the game was a back and forth affair, with AU senior goalkeeper Lucas Belanger making a diving save off a Bucknell header and Bison goalkeeper Ryan Ott tipping a long range effort from freshman midfielder Max Holdsworth. However, it was Bucknell that scored first, with senior midfielder Sebastiaan Blickman breaking through the Eagle defense to beat Belanger with a shot into the bottom left corner of the goal.
The second half was dominated by the Eagles as they peppered Ott and the Bucknell defense with constant pressure, totaling 19 shots by the end of regulation. The breakthrough play came from senior defender Jake Garcia who headed in a cross from senior midfielder Panos Nakhid into the top right corner in the 88th minute.
Garcia, a typically central defender, was moved into a forward position by head coach Todd West as a last ditch effort to produce an equalizer.
“I told the guys I had an ulcer after we scored that one to tie it with two minutes left,” West joked. “But I really am excited, we eventually went to three [defenders] in the back and put Jake [Garcia] up top with the idea that he scores goals, which [he] obviously got.”
The pressure from AU continued into the first and second sudden death overtimes, and eventually the winner arrived when Garcia turned in a deflected corner kick from six yards out to guarantee the Eagles at least one more game in their season.
Garcia said he recognized the importance of the team’s situation, aware that the season and his college career could end that afternoon, and was thrilled that the team was able to eventually produce an equalizer and a win.
“That felt great, because when we were down 1-0, I was freaking out that it would be my last game,” Garcia said. “Then I got that goal. I was so excited, so at the end of the regulation, I just said ‘Come on, we’ve got this, it’s going our way,’ and then we found a way.”
Before the game, Garcia was named to the all-conference second team, with first team spots going to Nakhid and senior midfielder Dale Ludwig, and Belanger receiving third team honors. Nakhid was also awarded Patriot League Offensive Player of the Year, and Ludwig won Patriot League Midfielder of the Year. West noted that the team felt motivated to prove that Garcia deserved better than just second team.
“We told them at halftime that big players step up in big moments, and obviously Jake stepped up,” West said. “The other thing we said earlier in the week was that we thought it was a snub that Jake was a second team all-Patriot League guy instead of first team, so that’s a great response right there.”
This is the second consecutive  year that AU advanced to the championship game of the Patriot League tournament, however last year they lost  to Lehigh University in the final. The winner of the tournament receives an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. West acknowledged that playing the final 48 hours after playing a double overtime game would be difficult, but that this year would be different, with his team showing the resiliency to produce a positive result at Reeves Field on Sunday at 1:00pm.
“This game was like our final against Lehigh last year, and we lost [last year]. So coming back and winning this game, our message is that we can go win the final now,” West said. “These guys will be ready.”
