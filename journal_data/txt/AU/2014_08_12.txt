Pop duo Karmin and R&B singer JoJo will kick off this year’s Student Union Board concert lineup in Bender Arena on Aug. 23.
An AU ID will be required for entry to the concert. Doors will open at 8 p.m.
The show will be intimate despite the large venue, as with Chance the Rapper’s set in April 2014, Tam Sackman, SUB director, said.
“I wanted to explore the pop genre, or at least a genre other than hip-hop, so that more people feel as if their voices are being heard,” Sackman said. “Karmin’s music is upbeat, danceable and fun, and I want new and returning students to consider this a welcome to AU/welcome back party.”
Sackman thinks JoJo’s appearance might foreshadow a full-fledged comeback for the mid-2000s hitmaker.
“Now that she’s freed from the record label that was holding her captive, I expect her to start releasing more music and feel like I got her right before her comeback,” Sackman said.
This show follows last year’s well-received SUB lineup, which included Chance, Grouplove and Welcome Week performer Lupe Fiasco.
About Karmin
Amy Heidemann and Nick Noonan make up the duo Karmin, which got its start posting pop-tinged viral covers of rap songs like Chris Brown’s “Look At Me Now” and Lil Wayne’s “6 Foot 7 Foot” on YouTube. 

The duo signed with L.A. Reid’s Epic Records in 2011 and released its first Top 40 hit “Crash Your Party” in October of that year. The duo’s biggest hit to date is “Brokenhearted,” produced by Cirkut (Katy Perry, “Part of Me,” Miley Cyrus, “Wrecking Ball”) and Emily Wright. The song hit the top of Billboard’s U.S. dance chart and peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100.

After releasing three EPs between 2010 and 2012, Karmin released its first full-length album Pulses in March of this year. The album’s debut single “Acapella” cracked the Top 40 on the Billboard pop chart.
About JoJo
In 2004, at the age of 13, JoJo became the youngest artist to have a number one hit on the Billboard charts with her pop smash “Leave (Get Out).” 

Seven years later, she drew attention for her sultry remix of Drake’s “Marvin’s Room,” in which she reworked the song’s lyrics to fit a female perspective. 

Though she has yet to release a full studio album since 2006’s “The High Road,” she released “#LoveJo,” an EP of new material, in February of this year.
Full Disclosure: SUB director Tam Sackman and publicity coordinator Sydney Gore are members of The Eagle’s editorial staff.

Current Political Communication students surround former SOC professor Dotty Lynch.
Dotty Lynch, a School of Communication executive in residence and prominent figure in the D.C. political scene, passed away early Sunday evening at a D.C. hospital.
The recently retired 69-year-old passed away after complications from melanoma, according to a Washington Post article. 
Lynch made an impact in Washington as one of the first pollsters to introduce the gender gap issue to political office hopefuls. In the mid 1980s, Lynch analyzed national politics as CBS News’ political editor, according to Lynch’s SOC faculty page.
After a career advising White House hopefuls, a Kennedy administration, surveying for the Democratic National Convention and working with CBS News, Lynch joined SOC’s faculty in 2006. Lynch merged politics and communication in the classroom and became instrumental in the creation of the SOC and School of Public Affairs masters in Public Communication program, Rose Ann Robertson, SOC’s associate dean for academic administration, said.
Robertson recognized how Lynch’s expertise and versatility became essential as a professor.
“Dotty was one of a kind,” Robertson said. “She was a journalist, a pollster, a political analyst and an extraordinary teacher. She conveyed to her students the excitement about the political process that she felt every day.”
Lynch’s passing was met with a Twitter outpouring in remembrance. Bob Schieffer, Diane Sawyer and Gwen Ifill were among the famous names that gave their condolences.
RIP Dotty Lynch, as smart as she was good as she was generous to all of us in and around politics. #wayfarertoast

Our condolences are with the family of Professor Dotty Lynch. A true asset to AU and a trailblazer in her field. She will be missed dearly.
“Her legacy was that she brought the outside in,” SOC professor Amy Eisman said. “At any given point somebody spectacular who was very much a key player in the political world would be at the end of her phone.”
Lynch retired in May with hopes of traveling around the world. Paris was at the top of her list for the summer, according to SOC Assistant Professor and Division Director Pallavi Kumar.
Lynch is survived by her husband, Morgan Downey, and stepson, Robert Downey.

Tenleytown’s Safeway supermarket will closing its doors in 10 months after being purchased by nearby Georgetown Day School. The June 5 announcement also included the Georgetown Day School’s purchase of Tenleytown’s Martens Volvo/Volkswagen car dealership.
The Tenleytown supermarket purchase came after Safeway announced they would be shutting down the location in 10 months after years of renovation talks, Georgetown Day School Director of Communications Alison Grasheim said.
Safeway’s location allows the private school to continue its attempts to move the lower and middle school locations close to the Tenleytown location across from the grocery store, Grasheim said. 
Originally, the supermarket wanted to demolish the Tenleytown location and replace it with a new facility with a modern design. According to Safeway spokesman Craig Muckle, Safeway’s Georgetown, Bethesda and upcoming Petworth locations were considered as the templates for a sleeker renovation but the company decided to close the Tenleytown location instead. 
Georgetown Day School’s recent offer was not its first. Muckle said the day school has made expansion plans known for the last five years. The grocery store’s closure made it possible for the company to sell the location and for GDS to achieve its five year goal of expanding into the neighborhood.
Tenleytown’s Safeway is currently one of two grocery stores in the neighborhood. It is often seen as a cheaper alternative to Whole Foods on Wisconsin Avenue. The supermarket’s impending closure has some students worried about where they will be able to purchase budget-friendly groceries.
There are other options for students concerned with buying affordable groceries. The Georgetown, Palisades and Chevy Chase circle Safeway locations are feasible for students, Muckle said.
There are a few options for students looking for an alternative to Whole Foods:
