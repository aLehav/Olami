How many concussions does Creed have? Although that question is not answered in “Creed III,” the film confronts childhood trauma and how it affects the next generation. 
Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) is the son of the famous fighter who battled Rocky Balboa in the original “Rocky” movie. However, “Creed III” makes several noticeable departures from the classic “Rocky” formula; Rocky is known for being featured in other “Creed” films but did not make an appearance in this installment, and the film does not follow the classic “student becomes the teacher” or “underdog becomes champion” tropes like previous “Rocky” films did. 
After winning the Heavyweight World Championship, Adonis announces his retirement from boxing. The film flashes back to a memory of one of his childhood friends, Damian “Dame” Anderson (Jonathan Majors). Dame returns to Adonis in the present time from a long prison sentence. Clouded with guilt, Adonis helps his old friend get back in the ring and train to become the champion of boxing.
The full flashback is not revealed until the end of the film. Although the suspense was nailed through fights in and out of the ring that were drawn out just enough, the full flashback was slightly underwhelming compared to the build-up. 
However, an alternate way to look at the underwhelming revelation is that the film shows how even the slightest incident from your past can damage your future. Throughout the film, Adonis struggles with the traumatic emotions coming from his childhood. This plays into the typical toxic masculinity trope presented. But through his relationship with his wife Bianca (Tessa Thompson) and strong-tempered daughter, Amara (Mila Davis-Kent), he is able to confront his past and his emotions. 
Whether it was through having tea or play sessions with his daughter, Adonis’ relationship with his daughter is a sweet touch to the film. Their quality time juxtaposes other scenes of fighters getting their teeth knocked out in the ring. Amara is deaf and only communicates in sign language to both her parents. Their relationship shows you can communicate love without your words, whether it be through sign language or teaching her how to fight. 
Adonis’ confrontation with his childhood is also shown in the relationship between him and his foster mother. His mother is a constant warm presence throughout the film, giving him advice about Dame. 
If you're not familiar with the “Rocky” franchise, the “Creed” movies are filled with endless references to the original “Rocky” movies, such as the training montages. Tire flipping, running and clapping push-ups give a similar vibe to the iconic “Rocky” on the stairs moment. Referencing the original “Rocky” movie added a classic touch to a film that was trying to take on a non-traditional approach.  
Even though viewers may expect the conclusion once they see the direction the film takes, the film builds up enough suspense to make the ending worth it. Although Bianca is highly opposed, Adonis teaches Amara how to fight. There has been no official announcement, but it seems the next generation of boxing can continue on with Adonis’ daughter. 
“Creed III” was released in theaters March 4.

Senior outside hitter Zeynep Uzen has already made a lasting impact on American University’s  volleyball team. Since winning the Patriot League Championship in her freshman season, she has continued to dominate on the court, accomplishing many impressive feats in her four years with the Eagles. 
Despite obstacles such as the coronavirus pandemic, she has remained resilient and focused on her goal of winning the Patriot League title for a second time.
Born and raised in Istanbul, Uzen is no stranger to overcoming adversity. When the opportunity came to play at the college level, she flew across the globe to AU to embark on a new journey, embracing the struggles that came with leaving her family and friends at home. 
The adjustment was a challenge, and Uzen recalled feeling out of place often. To make her transition even more difficult, as soon as she arrived in D.C., it was time for fall sports to begin.
Uzen found herself navigating life in a new country, life in college and life as a Division I athlete all at once.
“It’s like having two different lives,” she said, “but being in two completely different environments has made me more mature.” 
Her maturity has carried her far during her volleyball career, helping her make adjustments to her game, facilitate big plays, and take on a leadership position for her team. 
In her freshman season, she was named the Patriot League Rookie of the Week four times before ultimately being crowned the Patriot League Rookie of the Year and named a member of the All-Patriot League First Team.
She finished the season with 276 kills, averaging 2.76 per set and recording six double-double performances. 
Her stellar freshman season was only the beginning of what was to come. In spite of a shortened season during her sophomore year due to the pandemic, Uzen was able to continue her success, averaging 2.19 kills per set and being named to the Patriot League Honor Roll. 
She came back even stronger during her junior season, being named to the Patriot League First Team, Patriot League All-Tournament Team and the All-Patriot League Team. Uzen led her team with 525 total kills, averaging 4.10 per set during the season.
These standout statistics left her ranked nationally for NCAA Division I play, placing her seventh overall for kills and 10th for total points.  
This past season, Uzen reached 1,000 kills in her career, an accomplishment only 14 other Eagles have reached in program history.
When asked about her time at AU, Uzen recalls how amazing it felt to see her hard work pay off, crediting her success to the unwavering support from her teammates and coaches.  
“In every practice we push ourselves to play on a better level than previous. We are competing with each other to play better volleyball,” Uzen said.
Despite her many achievements, Uzen said she is still her harshest critic, and she felt like something is missing. 
“The job is not done,” she said, referring to her career at AU. “I want to feel that emotion and reach that level of success again that comes with winning the title.”
Uzen is set to return for a fifth season this fall with her sights set on helping bring the Eagles their 17th Patriot League Championship win since the team joined the league in 2001. 
When asked about her other long-term goals, she expressed interest in playing beyond the collegiate level, hopefully in Europe for a professional women’s team.
Whatever is next for Uzen, we can expect to see her continue to flourish as both a volleyball player and a young woman.
“Volleyball is not a sport you can win with only one player. If I reach success, it is all because of my team’s effort and support.” Uzen said.

American Univeristy's lacrosse team defeated Howard University 15-2 in its Feb. 24 home opener.
The American University lacrosse team (3-2) fell to the Mercer University Bears (2-1) in their March 4 game 15-14.
In the final game of a three game homestand, American began the scoring, as they had in their previous four games as well. Mercer won the opening draw control, but the AU defense pressured their attack and forced a shot that junior goalkeeper Mary Alice Collins saved easily. Freshman midfielder Reagan Murdoch broke away to give the Eagles the 1-0 lead. American continued to get scoring chances and readily shot at Mercer but were unsuccessful. Mercer followed up with two goals of their own and took the lead over American. This was the first time AU had trailed at home all season.
American junior midfielder Hannah Spease tied it back up, and freshman attacker Annabelle Jackson followed her lead with a bounce shot goal to make it 3-2 for the Eagles. Not wanting to be left out of the scoring parade, sophomore attacker Maddy Spratt added a goal of her own just 29 seconds later. Mercer countered with another two goals of their own to tie it up once again. With just 49 seconds left in the quarter, Jackson scored her second of the game to retake the one goal lead for the Eagles. The first quarter was dominated by offense on both sides, with the teams combining for 18 shots and nine goals.
The second quarter would be much of the same as the first, as American kicked off the scoring once again. The referees dealt a yellow card to Mercer, and senior attacker Emma Hare took advantage and scored a man-up goal to make it 6-4 AU. Mercer won the draw control and cut the Eagles’ lead in half. They quickly added another two goals and led the Eagles 7-6. The rest of the quarter continued as a back and forth affair, and American never regained the lead. Jackson netted her third of the game with just eight seconds remaining to finish the half 9-8, Mercer.
The third period was the quietest of the whole game, with just one goal from AU and three from Mercer. Both goalies performed well, combining for six saves on 11 total shots. Spratt scored American’s only goal of the quarter thanks to being man-up after Mercer’s yellow card. 
The fourth quarter would be much more eventful, with the two teams doubling their combined total from the previous quarter. Jackson began the scoring with her fourth of the game, already the 11th goal of the season for the freshman. Sophomore midfielder Becca Frank added on, shrinking Mercer’s lead to just one goal. Mercer had their number, however, and scored the next one. The quarter continued on the way it began, with AU and Mercer exchanging goals but with Mercer always one step ahead. The game remained tight and was tied up thanks to Hare scoring a man-up goal with seven minutes left. Junior defender Jordan Mitchell played well for much of the game but took a yellow card with about two minutes left in the game. Mercer scored what would be the game winner just after and held on to win 15-14.
In their previous two games against Howard and GW, AU had 11 and eight different goal scorers, respectively. Against Mercer, their 14 goals came from just six different players, with 11 coming from Jackson, Spratt and Hare. 
“When we're finding success it is when we're sharing the ball is when we've got, you know, prolific scoring from multiple people,” head coach Lindsay Teeters. “It's still early in the season and you know, we need to make sure that we're continuing to spread that offense and have seven powerful scorers. It's really important for us to play a physical game and to be ready for those and to be able to handle the pressure, which is something I think we struggled with today”
The Eagles next take on the UC Davis Aggies on Friday, March 10 at 8 p.m. in California.

Men's basketball ended its season after falling to Lafayette in the Patriot League Tournament semifinals. 
The American University men’s basketball team (17-15) fell to No 6. Lafayette College (11-22) in the Patriot League semifinals despite overcoming a 21-point deficit to force two overtimes. Losing by 8 in the second overtime, the Eagles’ season came to an end with a score of 84-76.
The game started with a defensive battle, with neither team scoring until one minute and 24 seconds into the game. Junior guard Lorenzo Donadio broke the scoring dry spell with a jumper in the paint for the Eagles. 
Lafayette responded with a basket of their own before establishing an early lead. The Eagles struggled with the Leopards’ hot hands from beyond the arc shooting 61.5 percent from 3. With seven 3-point baskets, Lafayette established a 19-point lead with five minutes remaining in the half.
With the help of junior forward Matt Rogers, who went on a 7-point scoring streak, the Eagles were able to cut the lead down to 16 at the half. 
The second half started with the Eagles continuing to slowly chip away at the Leopards’ lead. A 3-pointer and jumper from junior guard Johnny O’Neil was able to cut the deficit down to 11.
From there, American found the momentum they were lacking before and went on a 14-3 run, including a 3-point basket from freshman guard Geoff Sprouse to bring the game within 8 points.

Lafayette was unable to match American, and the Eagles sparked an 8-0 run. With a dunk from senior guard Jaxon Knotek, the Eagles found themselves down 1 point after overcoming a 21-point deficit in the matchup.

With a made hookshot post move from Rogers, the Eagles had their first lead since they were 2-0 in the beginning of the matchup.

Lafayette was fouled and sent to the line. However, they only connected on one free throw, so the game was tied 59-59 and sent into overtime.
Overtime gave the two teams five more minutes to fight for the win. The Eagles had a strong start with a made 3-pointer from Rogers. A layup from Knotek put the Eagles up 5 against the Leopards with 23 seconds left to play.
American sent Lafayette to the line with a foul, and the Leopards were able to cut the lead down to two. In a lapse of judgment by AU, Lafayette connected with a 3-point basket with four seconds left, tying the game 66-66 and sending the teams into double overtime.
The Leopards took over in the second overtime, going on an explosive 10-0 run while the Eagles were unable to score. Despite a basket made by American, it was not enough to overcome the lead Lafayette established. 
A final 3-point basket put the Eagles down 8 points with 12 seconds left, but it was too late. Lafayette ended American’s season with a final score of 84-76.
Rogers had his fifth double-double of the season with 24 points and 13 rebounds. Knotek followed with 16 points, sophomore guard Elijah Stephens had 15 points and O’Neil had 14 points and 8 rebounds.
