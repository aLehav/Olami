Senior Alexis Arrington spent her summer making educational videos through her newly found web series: "Everyone's Gay: A Look into Queer History."
American University senior Alexis Arrington enjoys talking about queer history. But, while quarantining at home, she found herself unable to talk about it without her normal audience of friends and classmates. So, Arrington decided to turn her casual conversations into a web series — “Everyone’s Gay: A Look into Queer History.”
The justice and law major launched her web series in May and released the first season of educational videos throughout the summer. The 21 short episodes feature the lives and legacies of LGBTQ+ icons like James Baldwin, Cleve Jones and the Lavender Menace group. 
Arrington said the content mainly comes from the classes she’s taken at AU. Her first episode, titled “How WWII Changed Everything,” explored the group consciousness and unofficial “gay hubs” established in port cities during the early 40s. 
“I got the idea to start there mostly because in the queer history classes I’ve taken on campus, that is where they start,” Arrington said. “It’s a natural starting place for when you’re looking at queer America and it also leads into so many other things.”
Arrington also uses social media to share LGBTQ+ history. She posted on Instagram Thursday to celebrate LGBTQ+ History Month. She also features “On this day in Queer History” posts on her Instagram story.
Part of her journey to share queer history is an homage to a movement that has paved revolutionary paths for people like her, Arrington said.
“You don’t realize how many steps have been taken to get to even where we are today,” Arrington said. “It's not perfect, we're not where we need to end up, but we've done so much and to honor that history is to also influence future movements.”
She said she also caters her content to follow current topics. When Black Lives Matter protests erupted across the country, Arrington focused on Black queer icons, two examples being Audre Lorde and Bayard Rustin. 
When it comes to preparing for the videos, Arrington said the process is like writing a research paper. She gathers reputable sources, builds background information and writes a script. Talking to the camera is not something she had a lot of prior experience with, but lots of practice and bloopers helped, Arrington said.
Though she hasn’t posted on YouTube since season one wrapped up at the end of the summer, Arrington has big plans. She plans to launch season two in December and wants to feature LGBTQ+ celebrities like Chely Wright, an openly gay country singer who was ostracized from the industry after coming out.
In whatever avenue she teaches queer history, Arrington said she wants to help people learn that the queer rights movement is complex, intersectional and most of all, human. 
“When you know a history of a group of people, you start to kind of humanize them,” she said. “In our society, you see a lot of people who are discriminated against, especially in the queer community, just because people don't understand things.”

President Sylvia Burwell announced in a University-wide email on Monday that an update regarding American University’s plans for the spring semester will come by the end of this month.
Like the decision to make classes online this past spring, summer and fall, Burwell said that the “key factors” in the University’s decision-making process will remain the same. These factors include the overall case count and trajectory of the pandemic, availability of widespread testing, contact tracing capacities, and the impact of D.C. requirements such as the 14-day quarantine for people from high-risk states. 
“Our goal is to ramp up in-person curricular, co-curricular, and residential opportunities over time as health and safety conditions allow,” Burwell wrote in her email.
This announcement comes after George Washington University announced on Friday that it will remain mostly online for their upcoming spring semester. 
Burwell also said there will be no further University-wide personnel actions taken, including additional furloughs or salary cuts. 
According to the email, the University has used over $40 million in reserve funds to avoid “significant personnel actions.”
The University previously announced that all employees making over $40,000 would undergo a five-day furlough between November and March and that the suspension of University contributions to employees’ retirement funds will continue through July 31, 2021. 
Additionally, the University has been able to keep fall enrollment levels within its projections, Burwell wrote, and is encouraging students who have deferred their enrollment to return in spring 2021. 
“We need to continue our vigilance, adhere to all cost-saving measures, and maintain our focus on enrollment and retention,” Burwell said. 
AU's hiring freeze will remain in effect, and the University will continue to hire for only “critical” positions, according to Burwell’s email. 
Burwell said that the nature of the pandemic makes decisions challenging and that plans will evolve over time. 
“We know we cannot return to completely normal operations immediately, and we need to remember that the public health situation can change in an instant,” Burwell wrote.

If you’re an Instagram user, chances are you’ve seen “Phone eats first,” a well-loved catchphrase for Instagram foodies. It might seem a little overdone, or even somewhat laced with braggadocio; but now, more than ever, that couldn’t be further from the truth. During quarantine, it’s important to celebrate any semblance of normalcy you come across. Why not show off the food you’ve been served on a rare night outside of your apartment? Give yourself permission to recognize the special parts of your week with these tips for sharing your meals to your social media feed. 
Natural lighting is your best friend 
It seems simple, but when it comes to food photography, the lighting in your space is going to be your best friend. Try to find sources of natural light — whether it’s by a window, on your porch or right outside whatever establishment you’ve just gotten a delicious treat from. Good lighting will show off the dynamics of the food you’re eating. Think about how beautiful it could look during golden hour. Places like Thomas Sweet in Georgetown or Georgetown Cupcake serve their treats with tons of beautiful colors that can be enhanced with the use of proper lighting. Avoid using the flash because it overwhelms your photo and washes out the food, which should be the star of your photo!  
Keep the space around your photo clean 
Even though the food in your photo is the focal point, there is usually more to the picture than that. Keep the space around the dish clean and decluttered to make for a better photo with minimal distractions for a potential foodie viewer. Find spaces with the least amount of clutter, a clean tabletop or counter are perfect examples that are sure to give you a quality photo. This doesn’t mean that the space has to be boring; if you’re having a picnic by the monuments, you can use your blanket as the background of your photo. This can add another layer to your photo, without taking away from the quality as a whole. 
Get creative with your angles 
Food is interesting, and the way that it’s represented can and should reflect that. That might mean moving some plates around or experimenting with the angle you point your camera. You can’t capture a loaded burger from the top, where all you’ll capture is the bun. A simple move to the side can give you a whole new perspective of the layers and elements that have gone into making your meal. Try out closeup shots of your food to really see the details of your dish.
Make use of props
Make your images represent you! Add your sense of personality to the way you show off your food pics. Props can be other dishes, the drink that was served with your meal or a cute, paper napkin wrapped around an ice cream cone. Props can even be the setting you’re eating in. For example, if you’re at Open City at the National Cathedral, try to find a way to incorporate the cathedral into your photo by having the building in the background. It is as simple as turning around from your table! It won’t overshadow the dish you’re photographing, but it will add a lot of personality and context to the picture you’re taking. Not only do props have the ability to add extra visual appeal, they also serve to showcase the main dish in your picture.
Don’t skip out on the editing
Editing is the step where you, as the photographer, get to have the most fun with your pictures. Taking the time to edit your selected image is crucial and gives you the opportunity to really make your photo pop. VSCO and Adobe Lightroom Photo Editor are two top quality, free apps that will set up any food photographer with the tools they need. Elements like exposure, contrast, shadows and saturation influence the way that lighting is presented in your photo. Editing can also manipulate the colors in your food photo, which leads to a more vibrant and appetizing looking picture. 
At the end of the day, there is one tip that stands out above the rest: Take pictures to make lasting memories of the foods and experiences that fill you. Share what makes you smile and brings something new to your routine as we figure out what life looks like nowadays. Happy snapping, happy eating and happy cooking!
