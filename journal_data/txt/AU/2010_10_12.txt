Friends and family celebrated the life of 2009 AU alumnus Andrew Wolf in a memorial service Oct. 12.
The 23-year-old, who received a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from AU’s College of Arts and Sciences, was killed Sept. 16 during a cycling trip in Canada, where he was struck by a tractor trailer, The Eagle previously reported.
The service, sponsored by the Department of Philosophy and Religion, helped the family deal with Wolf’s sudden death.
"When there is a tremendous loss, it’s hard to get your hands around it because there is a deep silence," said Robert Wolf, Andrew’s father. "The memorial fills out that emptiness because there is a shared memory that brings him alive in some way."
Wolf, of New Jersey, was riding for the Otesha Project, a Canadian charity that promotes sustainable consumption and lifestyle choices through theater, experimental activities and storytelling, according to the project’s website.
Wolf was a member of the project’s Highlands and Islands Tour, a team that cycles across eastern Canada’s Maritime province to encourage youth environmental education, according to the project’s website.
Two other cyclists traveling with Wolf along a four-lane highway sustained minor injuries, according to the website for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Wolf went to Chile in 2008 and wrote his thesis on student social justice in Chile and graduated from AU Magna Cum Laude, NorthJersey.com reported.
Wolf was a chef and educator at Brainfood — a D.C. non-profit organization that reaches teens through food. He also worked in New York for the Children’s Aid Society as a food educator.
Students, staff and faculty joined the Wolf family in remembering Wolf’s time at AU.
Professor Jin Park taught Wolf in a course on Derrida and Buddhism and said she knew at once that he was a philosophy major.
"Andrew was a smart, smart kid, who was going to go to Mexico and work on the food issues," Park said. “He was just the most thoughtful person.”
Chris Watson, Wolf’s colleague, who had worked with him on his Fulbright proposal to Mexico described Andrew as someone who had a lot of respect for human dignity.
Shelly Harshe, the administrative assistant of the philosophy and religion department, said Andrew would always stop by her office to catch up.
"He was full of energy and was interested in everything,” Harshe said. “He cared about how I was doing and how my studies were going.”
AU alumna Corina Parkwell, who used to be friends with Andrew, said he "was enthusiastic and he danced with reckless abandon. Andrew was the sweetest and loveliest guy.”
A philosophy graduate student, Phil Vaughn, Andrew's friend, said Andrew loved hanging in the library and "everything he did had to do with love."
"We have heard a lot about his passion, compassion and inquisitive nature," said AU Chaplain Rev. Mark Schaefer. “Andrew was someone that saw everything as something precious, so the best way to honor him is by taking what you've learned from Andrew and applying it in your own lives.”
The Rotary Club of Ridegewood A.M. will sponsor a scholarship in Wolf’s name, to be awarded to “community-minded students,” his father Robert Wolf said.

Smokers might soon have to be more careful about where they light up on campus. A new revised policy could prohibit students from smoking within 25 feet of campus buildings.
The new policy, drafted by Director of Sustainability Chris O’Brien, would not only give clean air rights to non-smokers tired of breathing in secondhand smoke but is also a pre-requisite for LEED certification of campus buildings, including the School of International Service building.
Currently, smoking inside all academic buildings and work areas on campus is prohibited, but smoking on University grounds and outside buildings is permitted, according to the policy listed in the Student Handbook.

What students think about it: 
Non-smokers
“Why should I be subjected to your smoking?” 
Amanda Young, SPA, freshman
“I hate people smoking. It’s very disgusting to me. I give tours and I always have parents asking me how far they [smokers] have to be. It’s not just people here, but people who are coming here who are worried.”
Rachel Rabinowitz, CAS, junior
“Twenty-five feet is a good enough distance where [smoke] won’t just waft into the building.”
Maggie McGuire, CAS, junior
Smokers
“I think if they provide a covered location for people to smoke in during rain that has benches where we could smoke would be fine. But give me a place to smoke.”
Megan Ackerman, SOC, senior
“For the most part, I just try to be courteous. As a smoker, I don’t want to walk that far away.”
Alana Coleman, SPA, senior
“I can understand why people wouldn't want that [the new policy]. You can smell smoke inside buildings. I'd rather not smoke in the rain though. I think it's just a matter of comfort for smokers."
Jay Cho, CAS, sophomore

However, the new signs outside of the Mary Graydon Center asking students to not smoke within 25 feet of the building conflict with this policy.
O’Brien has been drafting a new policy over the last year that institutes an official Student Handbook policy to enforce these signs. Other administrators are currently reading the policy, but O’Brien does not know if or when it would take effect.
The new signs, added Oct. 6 by the Office of Campus Life, supplement existing signs on MGC’s doors, which read “Smoke Free Area.” The new stand-alone signs can be seen outside the main doors of MGC, as well as by the side entrance closest to the Tavern.
Director of University Center Operations Scott Jones believes the signs are already making smokers outside of MGC more conscious of their location.
“With the new signs, as we approach folks, there’s a much more respectful response,” Jones said. “We’ve seen less [smoking] overall.”
The proposed smoking policy has not come to the president’s cabinet yet, making it difficult to project a timeline for its formal consideration.
The effective date is up to President Neil Kerwin, Hanson said.
Reasons for New Policy
O’Brien’s new policy reflects AU’s awareness that secondhand smoke is a form of air pollution, he said. It is meant to address vagueness and confusion surrounding AU’s current smoking policy.
There are currently no LEED certified buildings on AU’s campus, but the new School of International Building is registered with the U.S. Green Building Council and is being considered for LEED Gold certification, according to O’Brien.
Even if a campus-wide policy is not in place, the SIS building would need to have a 25-foot smoke-free perimeter to be certified, according to O’Brien.
A push from students is also responsible for the possible change in policy.
Noah Jacobs, a graduate student in the School of Communication, produced a film about AU’s smoking policy and the issues surrounding the policy. 
“The University is so progressive, but this is a fundamental right,” Jacobs said. “Smoke lingers. It’s not something you can choose not to breath.”
Jacobs’ 15-minute documentary tries to clarify exactly what the current smoking policy means and how it applies to building entrance ways. His film is currently featured on SmokeFree D.C.’s website.
“I don’t think smokers should be making the decision on what I breathe as I walk into academic buildings,” said Jacobs, who is a former smoker. “I don’t want to be perceived as someone who hates smokers ... The issue is smokers aren’t aware if they are in violation of the policy.”
Enforcement
The 25-foot boundary described by the new signs outside of MGC are part of a “courtesy zone,” according to Gail Hanson, vice president of Campus Life.
There is no actual enforcement of this zone by the University, and AU still relies on “community enforcement,” Hanson said.
She defined community enforcement as a “community member to community member” system that relies on students and staff to ask others to be more considerate.
“It’s a civility thing,” Hanson said. “It’s not a rule. People won’t be punished but will be considerate.”
However, Hanson is only responsible for managing stand-alone buildings where Campus Life departments are the only or principal occupants. This includes MGC, the Kay Spiritual Life Center, the residence halls and McCabe Hall.
The vice president of Finance and Treasurer is responsible for all other University buildings, including the SIS building.
 Public Safety does not have the resources to enforce a smoking policy, according to Public Safety Chief Michael McNair.
“You should use the least amount of force required,” McNair said. “Public Safety shouldn’t be the first resort.”
But Jacobs thinks concrete processes of enforcement are necessary. Just the threat of a ticket would decrease the number of smokers in entranceways and would require minimal University effort, Jacobs said.
Modes of enforcement for the possible new policy are still in discussion. O’Brien believes any type of enforcement would follow the same procedures as currently outlined for any type of misconduct in student handbook.
Public Safety will respond to violations of the policy if called by faculty and staff. So far this year, Public Safety has responded to seven to eight smoking violations, according to McNair.
All of these cases involved a person smoking inside a building who refused to stop when asked by a faculty or staff member but when confronted by Public Safety was compliant, McNair said.
McNair feels that smoking on campus isn’t nearly as big a hazard as it has recently been publicized. He feels Jacobs’ video was exaggerated for effect.
“I walk campus a fair amount, and I don’t see 25 people in one place light up at once,” McNair said. “I usually see one or two. Not sure that constitutes any hazard.”
A new policy and/or any type of enforcement of this policy will be met by a lot of resistance from students, McNair said.
“It’s an issue that’s going to plague us for years to come,” McNair said. “There’s no silver bullet.”

“For the most part, I just try to be courteous. As a smoker, I don’t want to walk that far away.”
Alana Coleman, SPA, senior
“I can understand why people wouldn't want that [the new policy]. You can smell smoke inside buildings. I'd rather not smoke in the rain though. I think it's just a matter of comfort for smokers."
Jay Cho, CAS, sophomore
“I can understand why people wouldn't want that [the new policy]. You can smell smoke inside buildings. I'd rather not smoke in the rain though. I think it's just a matter of comfort for smokers."
Jay Cho, CAS, sophomore

However, the new signs outside of the Mary Graydon Center asking students to not smoke within 25 feet of the building conflict with this policy.
O’Brien has been drafting a new policy over the last year that institutes an official Student Handbook policy to enforce these signs. Other administrators are currently reading the policy, but O’Brien does not know if or when it would take effect.
The new signs, added Oct. 6 by the Office of Campus Life, supplement existing signs on MGC’s doors, which read “Smoke Free Area.” The new stand-alone signs can be seen outside the main doors of MGC, as well as by the side entrance closest to the Tavern.
Director of University Center Operations Scott Jones believes the signs are already making smokers outside of MGC more conscious of their location.
“With the new signs, as we approach folks, there’s a much more respectful response,” Jones said. “We’ve seen less [smoking] overall.”
The proposed smoking policy has not come to the president’s cabinet yet, making it difficult to project a timeline for its formal consideration.
The effective date is up to President Neil Kerwin, Hanson said.
Reasons for New Policy
O’Brien’s new policy reflects AU’s awareness that secondhand smoke is a form of air pollution, he said. It is meant to address vagueness and confusion surrounding AU’s current smoking policy.
There are currently no LEED certified buildings on AU’s campus, but the new School of International Building is registered with the U.S. Green Building Council and is being considered for LEED Gold certification, according to O’Brien.
Even if a campus-wide policy is not in place, the SIS building would need to have a 25-foot smoke-free perimeter to be certified, according to O’Brien.
A push from students is also responsible for the possible change in policy.
Noah Jacobs, a graduate student in the School of Communication, produced a film about AU’s smoking policy and the issues surrounding the policy. 
“The University is so progressive, but this is a fundamental right,” Jacobs said. “Smoke lingers. It’s not something you can choose not to breath.”
Jacobs’ 15-minute documentary tries to clarify exactly what the current smoking policy means and how it applies to building entrance ways. His film is currently featured on SmokeFree D.C.’s website.
“I don’t think smokers should be making the decision on what I breathe as I walk into academic buildings,” said Jacobs, who is a former smoker. “I don’t want to be perceived as someone who hates smokers ... The issue is smokers aren’t aware if they are in violation of the policy.”
Enforcement
The 25-foot boundary described by the new signs outside of MGC are part of a “courtesy zone,” according to Gail Hanson, vice president of Campus Life.
There is no actual enforcement of this zone by the University, and AU still relies on “community enforcement,” Hanson said.
She defined community enforcement as a “community member to community member” system that relies on students and staff to ask others to be more considerate.
“It’s a civility thing,” Hanson said. “It’s not a rule. People won’t be punished but will be considerate.”
However, Hanson is only responsible for managing stand-alone buildings where Campus Life departments are the only or principal occupants. This includes MGC, the Kay Spiritual Life Center, the residence halls and McCabe Hall.
The vice president of Finance and Treasurer is responsible for all other University buildings, including the SIS building.
 Public Safety does not have the resources to enforce a smoking policy, according to Public Safety Chief Michael McNair.
“You should use the least amount of force required,” McNair said. “Public Safety shouldn’t be the first resort.”
But Jacobs thinks concrete processes of enforcement are necessary. Just the threat of a ticket would decrease the number of smokers in entranceways and would require minimal University effort, Jacobs said.
Modes of enforcement for the possible new policy are still in discussion. O’Brien believes any type of enforcement would follow the same procedures as currently outlined for any type of misconduct in student handbook.
Public Safety will respond to violations of the policy if called by faculty and staff. So far this year, Public Safety has responded to seven to eight smoking violations, according to McNair.
All of these cases involved a person smoking inside a building who refused to stop when asked by a faculty or staff member but when confronted by Public Safety was compliant, McNair said.
McNair feels that smoking on campus isn’t nearly as big a hazard as it has recently been publicized. He feels Jacobs’ video was exaggerated for effect.
“I walk campus a fair amount, and I don’t see 25 people in one place light up at once,” McNair said. “I usually see one or two. Not sure that constitutes any hazard.”
A new policy and/or any type of enforcement of this policy will be met by a lot of resistance from students, McNair said.
“It’s an issue that’s going to plague us for years to come,” McNair said. “There’s no silver bullet.”

In addition to the disappearance of spare time, money (spent on mostly coffee these days), and perhaps a bit of our sanity, furniture from the University Center and Butler Pavilion have been disappearing over the course of this semester. We don’t know who the perpetrator of such vile acts is — students on a vandalism lark, students too poor to furnish their house this semester or a dastardly villain that isn’t a student at all. Regardless of the culprit, however, the humor in this situation is fading fast.
An e-mail was circulated on campus last week regarding the thefts and the estimated costs of replacement for the items stolen, including ten bar stools from the Marketplace and a booth seat from the Tavern. That figure currently hovers around $7,000, a fortune to us students that often find ourselves paying to intern (for credit and transportation).
Better yet, if the items are not returned, the costs of replacing these items comes out of our tuition money. While $7,000 dispersed amongst a student population of over 6,000 seems insignificant, it’s really an issue of the principle of the matter — we’re paying for furniture rather than our education.
To be fair, we have no idea who is to blame. It could be a student, an employee or a random individual who came across MGC open late on a week/weekend night and decided they needed some Butler Board Room chairs. Despite the lack of a scapegoat or responsible party to hold accountable, the underlying issue remains: Even if we students are not directly responsible (or even if we are) for the damages done to this campus, we are held financially accountable for them. Past and present residents of the dorms can attest to this, having paid for numerous damages done to ceiling tiles, bulletin boards and pulled fire alarms at some point in time. While the majority of us are not running around on a Saturday night punching out ceiling tiles or stuffing Tavern booths into our trunks, people out there are. And we are the ones paying for it.
In addition, this string of thefts could one day mean a change in our ability to use MGC late at night. MGC is open 24 hours a day and has served not only as source of food and center of learning, but also as a study area and place of refuge during middle-of-the-night fire alarms for many of us. Thefts of this magnitude tend not to occur in those buildings that are locked up at night, such as Ward. If MGC continues to be pillaged and plundered in the middle of the night (or another time of day that someone can sneak a Tavern booth out the back door unnoticed), then our ability to use these facilities may be jeopardized. While some of us can spend hour upon hour in Bender Library, those of us that get that soul-crushing feeling from spending too much time there will be unduly impacted by the disappearance of this favorite late-night alternative study location. 
While these thefts appear at first to be fairly insignificant or even humorous, the reality is that unless the items are returned and the actions cease to occur, the effects will have repercussions for us all.
If the culprit or culprits are students, we ask you: Please return these items. Please do not steal any more items. Not to mention that you’re bringing down heaps of bad karma upon yourselves. This is our community. Our home away from home, if you will. We all live and share in it, and by doing stupid stuff like this, you’re hurting all of us — and may whatever higher power you believe in help you if we find out who you are after we spend all night in the library.

Edward Norton is the poster boy for character actors everywhere. While most may recognize him as the deranged and radical Tyler Durden from “Fight Club,” Norton manages to stand out amongst Hollywood’s most talented thespians. From playing a skinhead in “American History X” to a revamped Bruce Banner in “The Incredible Hulk,” Norton prides himself on his ability to completely blend into the characters he plays. 
“I don’t really tend to approach [films] thinking about how they interact with me,” Norton said in an interview with The Eagle. “I just am not that interested in splattering myself out there.”
In one of their first big events of the year, ThinkTalk, a D.C.-based television program, and the AU Film Society hosted a Q&A with the famed actor. Students filled up Ward 2 to ask him a couple of their own burning questions, which ranged from asking how life-changing “Fight Club” was to his experience with documentary films. In addition, Norton discussed some films that have personally influenced him, such as Spike Lee’s groundbreaking “Do the Right Thing” and films from Terrence Malick and Milos Forman. 
In his most recent work, “Stone,” Norton plays the titular character, a criminal from Detroit trying to get parole after serving eight years of a fifteen-year jail sentence. Stone is the stereotypical thug, complete with cornrows and a foul mouth. Most of the film takes place inside the office room of Stone’s parole officer, Jack Mabry, played by Robert De Niro. While true Norton fans know that this is not his first film playing a criminal, Norton dispels any queries that “Stone” is an action-packed thriller with a secondary script. 
“There’s no chase scenes and no weapons,” Norton said. “The drama in this film comes from this cork-screwing tension that just evolves in conversation. So if you’re an actor, it’s like, ‘At last — I matter!’”
In order to accurately portray Stone, Norton and “Stone” director John Curran traveled to prison facilities just north of Detroit to research exactly how they should model Stone.
“A lot of the people we were interested in were coming out of the gang and drug culture in southwest Detroit ... John and I spent a lot of time mining what they said and transferring it over into the script,” Norton said. “Literally, for the sound of my voice, there was this one guy in particular we met who had a very broken, gravelly, strange sort of voice. John and I both found it very hypnotic.”
Along the course of the film, Stone discovers religion, which changes the entire theme of the movie. It is not solely about spiritual awakening, but rather about dealing with morals and convictions. It was not a personal application for Norton, so much as it was for Curran. 
“To me, the specifics of what Stone gets into are beside the point,” Norton said. “What I liked was that John was aiming at opening up the question of ‘how does one assert that there’s only one way for a person to achieve illumination?’ Or one text, or one notion of how we communicate with the divine or get a sense of the divine?”	
Norton was truly inspired by Curran’s take on directing and his opportunity to have a very hands-on role in the development of this film. As an actor for the past 12  years, Norton has amassed a wealth of knowledge about the film industry that he is keen to share with others. 
“I think that people coming up now need to push against the model in their own ways. I would tell filmmakers to take inspiration from Radiohead and what they did, self-releasing their record to people. I’m excited to see how people leave the film distribution industry behind and stop worrying about how they’re going to find a way to get embraced by the mainstream, because that model’s going to be dead someday, sure as the record industry is going to be dead.” 
This advice is something that Norton lives by, having produced and directed “Keeping the Faith” himself, as well as producing eight other films and documentaries. His accomplishments even caught the eye of  the White House, and Norton was appointed to serve in the Committee on the Arts and Humanities alongside such actors as Forrest Whittaker and Sarah Jessica Parker.
“We’re there to advise the President on policy decisions about where to allocate funds for the most effectiveness. One project recognizes and awards small after school arts programs that work with at-risk kids. So, within our budget we give these awards to about two dozen groups per year,” Norton said. 
It’s clear that the multi-talented actor has tried his hand at a number of different careers, succeeding at whatever he works on. “Stone” is out in theaters everywhere.

One attribute you quickly acquire as a writer is thick skin. As an undergraduate columnist in San Diego, I once shadowed syndicated columnist Ruben Navarrette for the day. After a brief introduction, he asked me to follow him upstairs. He led me to his office and asked if I’d hold on just a minute. After a few moments he waved me over, pointed to his desktop and I peered over his shoulder.  
I was stunned. The first words I read were: YOU (RHYMES WITH BUCKING) (INSERT RACIST SLUR HERE). He smirked and clicked on the next one. To the biggest idiot in San Diego! He shrugged. Then held the cursor on the scroll bar for approximately 10 seconds and said wryly, “Not bad for 12:00 p.m., eh?” 
“That’s enough insults to last a lifetime,” I replied. “Just wait till the east coast wakes up,” I stupidly muttered under my breath.   
The barrage of vitriolic e-mails was not an aberration. See for yourself. Many articles or op-eds posted online elicit disparaging ad hominem attacks. At times, they’re warranted (see the tasteless Alex Knepper column last semester), and sometimes they’re not (see columns I compose). I, for example, have been referred to as a dolt (fairly accurate), and criticized for being too smart (way off base) by using too many polysyllabic words for the same column. Even the Negative Nancy’s disagree over their disappointment.  
It begs a larger question, why are we more motivated to act when we’re angry or upset than when we’re happy? Why does it take a recession before people start saving? Why does a girl have to threaten to dump her boyfriend before he starts paying attention? Why do we slander a professor for an unreasonable exam and flippantly ignore the bonus points gifted the week prior? I could go on and on. 
Are we simply irascible and yearning to be ticked off? Or is our reluctance to show equivalent approbation under positive circumstances, a societal failing in need of repair? Either way, we’ve got one giant unattractive chip on our shoulders.     
Last week I watched our volleyball team dismantle Holy Cross and encore that performance by escaping a tough Navy team. The second match was exhilarating, with the second set going to a nail-biting 34-32 before the Eagles prevailed. Yet aside from both basketball teams and a few friends/parents of the team, attendance was sparse. I’ve seen more vegetarians at Burger King.
However, I presume if AU administrators were considering axing the volleyball program (they’re not thankfully), there’d be a campaign of letters and exponentially more fans overnight. The outrage would spread instantly and suddenly we’d all be cheering as loud as Blake Jolivette (you’d know if you were there) at home games.
Perhaps we’re all wound up so tightly in our jobs, internships, homework and personal lives, it’s a chore to take a deep breath, acknowledge the good, and go out of our way to demonstrate our satisfaction like we do when we’re incensed. Perhaps it’s an aggregation of these stresses that make us aggressive drivers or induced the need for Eagle Rants (which I wholeheartedly endorse). It’s great to have a forum to blow off steam, but too frequently that venue encroaches on our typical behavior.  
Let’s face it — we take the positives for granted. 
How often do we pull a professor aside and say thanks after an inspiring lecture? How often do we tip 30 percent instead of 20 percent for excellent service? How often do we deride our employers behind close doors, while rarely appreciating them signing our checks? 
Not as often as we should. And while AU students are admirably provoked by national and international injustices — we’re widely seen as the most (politically) active in the nation — inspiration to act should come from positive circumstances too.

The garage is dark. There are four crates, spread in a loose cluster. One makes the bed of a sleeping man. He is cast in an ethereal, bluish light and as he wakes voices boom from hidden speakers. As the echoes reverberate around the room, the company enters, and “Macbeth” begins its whirlwind ride through insanity.
The setting of AU Players’ “Macbeth” may at first seem an odd logistical choice — it wasn’t easy to find (located in the P3 level of the Katzen Parking Garage), there’s no set stage and unfortunately, AU couldn’t do a thing about having one of the more climatic scenes interrupted by a revving Ford Explorer. 
“There were some very unique challenges to working with the space,” Director Leah Pope said.	
However, Pope pulled off working within the confines of a parking garage with skill and finesse, and said the space had “a certain resonance.”
“[We did things in Katzen] that we couldn’t do in Kay,” she said.
The “we” behind the show? A talented cast of primarily freshman, a motley crew of mechanicals — and some truly excellent actors.
“It was a very personal show,” Pope said. “Every cast member took it and made it their own,” Pope said.      
Take Macbeth for instance, played by freshman Ariel Duffy. From the beginning of the play, he plays a devoted husband first, and a hubristic quasi-villain second. His acting, especially when coupled with the brilliant sociopathy of Emily Goodell (the talented sophomore behind Lady Macbeth) embodies the bone-chilling theme of corruption and the addicting nature of power extending throughout the play. Goodell is perhaps the stand-out thespian in this show — she walks a fine line between madness and despair and keeps the audience enraptured throughout the show.
Another standout actor is sophomore Brad Parker, the fight captain and actor for Macduff. He is not only a talented actor, full of force and personality, but also an incredible swordsman. His climatic final battle with Macbeth was one of the standout moments of the play — the vigor and intensity looks downright professional — as it should. The fights were all directed by AU alumnus Kyle Encinas, a professional fight director who AU Players got for “much cheaper than we should have,” according to Pope.
The cast is rounded out by a fine set of secondary and tertiary characters — sophomore Erin Crandell (Lady Macbeth’s servant, and Lady Macduff) delivers perverted Shakespearean humor in finest order, and freshman Zachary Cohen delivers a fine performance as the Thane Angus. It is an intensely passionate show that suffers only (if at all) from some slow pacing in the middle. However, when the show hits its unraveling, the emotional vitality the cast delivers under the fine direction of Pope speeds the show along to a wonderful conclusion.
It is very rare for additions to the Bard’s work to improve the show, but the final moments of the play cast Macbeth’s very madness into doubt, and left the audience speechless. Leah Pope, the cast and all involved should be fiercely proud of their fine production.

If you are anywhere near Germany for the last three weekends of September, it is this author’s sincere recommendation that you go to Oktoberfest. For those of you who do not know, Oktoberfest is the world’s largest beer festival. According to materials from the travel company Bus2Alps, over the three weekends of the festival, six million people from all over the world will eat 18 million chickens and drink 8 million liters of some of the world’s best beer. Do I really need to do any more convincing?
To be entirely truthful, Oktoberfest is actually the world’s largest wedding anniversary. The Crown Prince Ludwig was married to Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen on Oct. 12, 1810. The citizens of Munich were invited to attend the festivities held on the fields in front of the city gates to celebrate the happy royal event. The fields have since been named Theresienwiese. Horse races in the presence of the Royal Family marked the close of the event. It was celebrated as a festival for the whole of Bavaria, a region of Germany.
In 1811, the festival continued with horse races and an Agricultural Show. In 1816, carnival games were introduced. As the 1800s rolled on, the traditional parade commemorating Ludwig was added, food stalls were constructed, and large glass mugs of beer were introduced. By the end of the 19th century, Oktoberfest had evolved into the giant party that this author was proud to have taken part in last week.
I will attempt to summarize the experience and point out some highlights.
First of all, the festival itself is essentially a giant county fair. There are carnival rides, food stands, and it is absolutely impossible to find parking. Though, considering the sheer amount of beer consumed over the course of the festival, that is probably a good thing.
However, Oktoberfest has something no other fair does: beer tents. Don’t let the name fool you, as most of these glorious establishments are not literal tents. For the most part, they’re small buildings, with the exception of the two of the most celebrated tents, which I will now talk about — since they’re the only two I made it to.
First of all, the Hofbrau tent is by far my favorite tent. It is the largest, most popular tent, and it is where you will find the majority of Americans, Australians, and other English-speaking foreigners. After waking up at 7 a.m. to get a seat, I managed to get my hands on my first beer of the festival at about 9. Ignoring the possible repercussions of drinking that early, I took my first sip. And in that split second, I completely understood why Keystone Light was the worst thing in the world. There are no words to describe how good that beer tasted. It was crisp and cold and happy and it felt like home. I ordered a few more steins.
After leaving the Hofbrau’s loving arms, I decided to get something to eat. At this point, my options were many and varied. However, having heard good things about Oktoberfest chicken, I decided to try some. This chicken is slowly cooked rotisserie style, wrapped in herbs, and served with a few wooden skewers and a bundle of paper and napkin that you will eventually use up in the vain attempt to clean off your face from the godly flavor of this chicken. Try it.
Eventually, I somehow made it to the Augustiner Tent. This is actually Munich’s oldest brewery, whereas Hofbrau is simply the largest. It’s like Yuengling and Anheuser-Busch, except it makes them both taste like water and urine. This tent is a far more authentic experience. (Think more lederhosen — a lot more lederhosen.) There are also more German songs and table dancing, whereas Hofbrau really only offers British people singing football chants and the occasional New Zealander drunkenly doing a traditional Maori dance. Either tent is an incredible time, and I encourage anyone who makes it out there to try both, or try new ones. 
Which acts as a lovely transition into my next point: time. You will need a lot of it, and you will need to make the most of whatever time you have. This requires pre-planning. You need to wake up early if you want to make it to the tents in time for a seat. You want to plan what tents to go to, and try and find out how quickly they fill up. Don’t be ashamed to ask locals, for the most part they are friendly, helpful and moderately fluent in English well enough. Don’t leave a fun tent just to try and stick to a concrete plan, but definitely have a framework.
And for the love of God, go to Oktoberfest. All of you.

With only one album to their name, London natives The xx performed like seasoned pros at the 9:30 club on the chilly night of Oct. 5. The reigning indie cool kids reflected the themes of minimalism and intimacy on their 2009 self-titled debut album in their mature, refined performance, seducing the sold-out crowd.
Vocalists Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim breathed the sensual lyrics, almost as if the audience was eavesdropping on an exchange between lovers — if those lovers were inexplicably hip, had matching haircuts and outfits, and were followed around by an MPC sampler played by Jamie Smith. The nearly pitch-black 9:30 — save for the artsy, bright backlighting, “xx” on the MPC booth, and a strobe “x” backdrop — created a chilling atmosphere that perfectly complimented Smith’s cool, crisp beats, Croft’s catchy guitar melodies and Sim’s rolling bass lines.
Starting off the set with the appropriate “Intro,” a drum ‘n’ bass-based intro of its own, xx set the tone that this show would be a slightly tweaked version of their album. With only 12 songs, the setlist was a jumbled version of the album’s tracklist, featuring covers of Womack & Womack’s “Teardrops” and Robin S.’s “Show Me Love.” The xx shined on “Show Me Love;” the lighter, dancier feel worked well against the more subdued original tracks.
Excited gasps came from the otherwise reserved audience within the opening notes of more popular songs “Crystalised,” “Basic Space,” “Vcr” and “Islands.” Minor tweaks like a slowed, a cappella end to “Basic Space” and extra dance beats in several songs were fantastic additions that helped break a too-close adhesion to their album’s sound.
A chilling, creepy side to “Fantasy” was revealed live, but the standouts were closing songs, “Night Time” and “Infinity.” Smith’s additions with the MPC sampler and drum machine brought “Night Time” to life and gave the song a driving, building feel that proved why The xx has earned so much hype in the past two years. Finale “Infinity” started off with a yearning intro of the call-response “Give it up / I can’t give it up” between the crooning Sim and cooing Croft. The same back and forth section at the end of the song was predictably prolonged, powerfully building to the end of the cool, jamming set.
Croft, Sim and Smith played a one-song encore, “Stars,” with a newly-lit background to match. Despite not being the strongest song in the set, “Stars” perfectly summed up the show: sexy, chill and a notch above the quality of the album.

AU was put on the map last week. On Oct. 7 the Tenley Campus served as the starting block for the final leg of the Sudan Freedom March, which began in New York City on Sept. 15. Thousands walked the 6.2 miles from our campus to Capitol Hill for a rally in support of “democracy and freedom from genocide and slavery?throughout Sudan.”
Last week’s rally highlighted the historic opportunity facing Sudan on Jan. 9, 2011. That day a referendum will be held on whether to split into two nations. The referendum is one of the remaining milestones of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005 that ended decades of civil war in ethnically and religiously divided Sudan. Another referendum will be held the same day in Abyei state, one of the disputed areas along the north-south border, to decide whether it will join the North or South. 
The referendum was spotlighted on Sept. 24 when President Barack Obama participated in a meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that focused on Sudan. The message from Obama to Vice President Osman Ali Taha, who was representing Sudan President Omar al-Bashir, was clear: The referendum must be held on schedule or there will be consequences. 
Will that alone do the trick?  Unlikely. The South (Abyei in particular) contains most of the country’s oil reserves. The Government of the North — led by Bashir, who has been indicted twice by the International Criminal Court for war crimes — is unlikely to let the South secede smoothly. Although he has pledged to honor the outcome of the referendum, the prospect of an independent South will mean revenue losses for the North. Voter manipulation — practiced with impunity during Sudan’s national elections in May — will be a real threat.
There are yet more obstacles to a timely referendum. The North’s ruling party — the National Congress Party — wants the border officially demarcated before the referendum, even though that isn’t required by the CPA. Voter registration was recently delayed until mid-November. The commission overseeing the referendum was only officially constituted on Sept. 15. The Southern government is trying to repatriate the hundreds of thousands of Southerners living in the North. Citizenship policies remain unresolved. With only three months until the referendum, the road ahead is foggy.
I have not mentioned Sudan’s main humanitarian crisis: Darfur. In September, I visited the Woodrow Wilson Center to hear Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the lead prosecutor of the ICC. In his discussion of his case against Sudanese government officials, Ocampo noted that Darfur and the referendum are not separate. In fact, a former Interior Minister charged with managing the Janjaweed and later the Humanitarian Affairs Minister is now the governor of South Kordofan, a border state next to Abyei and potential flashpoint like Darfur. One of the key actors in Darfur and closest confidants of President Bashir is positioned at what could be the eye of the storm. 
For AU students interested in conflict, political development and humanitarian affairs in Africa the Sudan referendum is significant. If it is stalled or manipulated the South will be deprived the right to self-determination. If mishandled, the chance of another civil war, and violence spread to the Democratic Republic of Congo and other neighbors, is possible. U.S. security interests are also at stake. Combating terrorism in the Horn is well-served by an empowered South. 
What can be done from our end?  U.S. pressure on the parties is imperative. Economic incentives and disincentives, along with the prospect of normalized relations, are important carrots and sticks. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have recently ramped-up this effort. This should continue. A bill introduced last week by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., — the Sudan Peace and Stability Act — shows congressional interest. Urging your elected officials to prioritize Sudan or teaming with an advocacy group is a great way to help further this objective.
There are less than 100 days until Jan. 9. Sudan should stay on the front-burner until then — and beyond.

Despite the protests of commissioners in Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3D, Bon Appétit’s renewed liquor license now covers the entire AU campus.
Bon Appétit must renew its liquor license with the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration every three years, and the previous license only allowed the food service company to serve alcohol in seven buildings on campus:
• the Mary Graydon Center
• the School of International Service building (now the East Quad Building)
• the Ward Circle building
• the Kay Spiritual Center
• the Katzen Arts Center
• the Kogod School of Business building
• the Batelle/Thompkins building
This June, when Bon Appétit petitioned ABRA to renew its license and extend it to include all AU campus buildings, ANC 3D formally complained to the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration to object the type of license Bon Appétit had.
ANC Commissioners Stuart Ross, ANC District 3D 04, and Tom Smith, ANC District 3D 02, whose single member district encompasses AU, filed formal letters of appeal with ABRA, saying Bon Appétit should have a catering license rather than a restaurant one.
“The concern was that Bon Appétit had the wrong license,” Smith said.
Smith’s letter also said there have been reports of “excessive noise and traffic at campus-related functions where alcoholic beverages have been served,” but Penny Pagano, director of Community and Local Government Relations, said she has never heard of any problems.
The ANC’s complaints were originally dismissed because it failed to send representatives to a hearing. The complaints were reinstated, however, because of previous paperwork errors.
But on Sept. 15, the ABC Board dismissed the ANC complaints again, saying they did not file their protests on the appropriate grounds.
According to the agency’s regulations, complaints must discuss how the license affects:
• peace, order and quiet
• “real property values”
• “residential parking needs and vehicular and pedestrian safety”
• “schools, recreation centers, daycare centers and public libraries”
• ability to attract school-age children before, during and after school
• creation of an “over concentration of license establishments”
Pagano said the majority of the special events are small and short. They are typically retirement celebrations, end-of-the-year parties and art gallery or exhibit openings.
Pagano and Bon Appétit Vice President Maisie Greenawalt said there were never any issues with past renewals.
“Perhaps things are more sensitive when we have a Campus Plan,” Pagano said.
In a July 20 letter to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, which oversees ABRA, Bon Appétit attorney Jerry Moore III said the University’s liquor license should expand with the University. 
“A recurring need arises for special events to be held in the venue that is associated with a particular University activity,” Moore wrote in the letter. “For example, it is unlikely and impractical for a Washington School of Law special event to be held at the University’s School of Business.”
AU can also rent out university space to outside groups — the Kay Spiritual Life Center can be rented out for a wedding — and those groups can apply for a one-day liquor license, according to Pagano.
The license is a Class D restaurant license, the same as it was in 2006, and allows Bon Appétit to serve beer and wine to 99 people or fewer at a time for a $600 fee. A catering license could cost the company anywhere between $500 and $5,000 because it is based on the caterer’s gross annual revenue.
ABRA regulations also stipulate that food or snacks and non-alcoholic beverages must be available at events where alcohol is served.
AU’s Alcohol Policy has stricter guidelines than the ABRA ones, including the prohibition of alcohol in University residence halls, Bender Arena and at open-air events.
Moore’s letter said alcoholic beverage sales have accounted for less than 3 percent of Bon Appétit ’s total food and beverage sales from 2006 to now.
Recently, after its formal petition to ABRA, the ANC approached ABRA to informally ask Bon Appétit to change their license to a different Class D type — a DX multi-purpose / public hall facility license, which has a $650 fee.
ABRA Community Resource Officer Cynthia Simms said this change would be voluntary, and Bon Appétit has the right to keep their current license. So far, Bon Appétit has not filed to make any changes.
“From our perspective, it has been settled,” Greenawalt said.

Superchunk — Majesty Shredding
(Merge)
Superchunk once held court in indie rock’s Mount Olympus. They and their Matador labelmates, Guided By Voices and Pavement, truly defined the genre. In 2010, the genre has given way to new forms, and most of their contemporaries have become legacy-touring acts. But in Superchunk’s latest effort, “Majesty Shredding,” the Chapel Hill slackers continue to rip like it’s 1991, featuring riff-laden, catchy material that sounds far too fresh for a group over three decades old. This album starts like a riot in “Digging For Something,” and refuses to slow down through 11 incendiary tracks, making a bold statement that the indie rock-punk movement will not fade away into the night.

Crocodiles — Sleep Forever
(Fat Possum)
Crocodiles’ second album is an even mix of synth pop and krautrock. The problem that casual listeners can have with krautrock is its lack of melodies, but Crocodiles’ best songs retain the genre’s repetitive, precise keyboard and drum patterns while building guitar and vocal hooks. The strongest cuts here are Springsteen-style anthems with a ton of distortion and a 10 second keyboard loop stretched out over the course of five minutes.

Aloe Blacc — Good Things
(Stones Throw)
Many artists find soul music to be one of the hardest genres to create because it’s so hard be authentic. Soul music, in the vein of Stevie Wonder, Al Green, and Sharon Jones, is made of equal parts love and heartbreak. Yet it doesn’t seem a problem for rapper-turned-singer Aloe Blacc, who’s created one of the most honest albums of the year. After moving from style to style in the underground rap scene, Blacc finally found some sort of signature sound on “Good Things.” He combines a rapper’s knack for lyricism with a soul singer’s smooth demeanor to curate an album about heartbreak, women (including a tearful ode to his aging mother), money and politics. Less innovative and sporadic than his first album “Shine Through,” it seems that with “Good Things,” Blacc has finally found a genre where he feels comfortable enough to stay for a while.

Zola Jesus — Stridulum EP
(Sacred Bones)
Zola Jesus probably wins “Best Goth Artist 2010” by default. She’s writing slow, mournful songs backed by minimalist synthesizers and maybe a guitar once in a while. Honestly, if this had been released in 1986, it would have blended in with the mountain of other goth artists, but today, after the genre has been killed by emo and acoustic guitars, Zola Jesus sounds fresh. It never moves beyond the “Siouxsie singing for Berlin” sound, but EPs this unique can stick with one style and still resonate.

Deerhunter — Halcyon Digest
(4AD)
Bradford Cox is a very busy man, having created three full length LPs with Deerhunter, two with side-project Atlas Sound, and more EPs than you can shake a stick at in just two years. That being said, it’s a small miracle that the well of inspiration has not been drained before the making of Halcyon Digest, and instead manages to sound like the product of a band infused with new life. The familiar shoegaze dreaminess of their previous efforts has been stripped down and made more accessible, culminating on transcendentally building “Desire Lines” and hazy “Earthquake.” And if the fact that Deerhunter sounds exactly like The Strokes on “Coronado” isn’t evidence of the band’s adventurism, I don’t know what is. Overall, Halcyon Digest is the kind of album that can make someone who previously disliked Deerhunter (yours truly) to consider this the best album of the year (i.e: pretty darn good).

AU officials recently circulated an e-mail to students, asking for the return of stolen University property by Oct. 18 with no penalties.
The property, worth a total of $7,311.30 in replacement costs, includes 10 Marketplace barstools, a Tavern booth seat, 30 Butler Board Room chairs and one Tavern high table, according to the e-mail.
Scott Jones, the University Center’s director of operations, said the replacement costs come out of student tuition, as the University Center’s budget is funded directly by tuition dollars.
The 10 bar stools were stolen during Welcome Week and the rest of the items have been taken over the course of the semester, according to Jones.
Jones said this year’s thefts have been “completely excessive,” and this is the most that has been stolen in one semester in his nearly seven years at AU.

Adding It Up: 
Adding It Up: 
10 Marketplace Bar Stools, total replacement cost is $3,475
1 Tavern Booth seat, total replacement cost is $941.30
30 Butler Board Room Chairs, total replacement cost is $2,400
1 Tavern high table, total replacement cost is $495.
SOURCE: Student Activities

The amnesty period lasts until Oct. 18. After that, the University will hold people accountable for having stolen the items. 
The items might seem expensive to students — one barstool costs nearly $350 — but Jones said the prices are typical of industrial-grade standards.
“It’s a higher grade than something like IKEA,” he said, adding that the inventory has been in use for five to seven years.
Jones is encountering problems ordering replacements, however. Some of the fabrics for the items have been discontinued, and some items have been discontinued altogether.
“It’s definitely costing more to replace these items than if they were simply returned,” he said.
The Department of Public Safety did not respond to request for comment by press time.

Scene Says: Inspiring look at the decidedly uninspiring U.S. education system by the director of ‘An Inconvenient Truth’
It doesn’t take much for a film to incite controversy. However, it does take a lot for a film to inspire hope. “Waiting for ‘Superman’’”  achieves both these things, but heated discussions and debates have overshadowed how good the film actually is.     
 A film that delicately balances human emotion with the cold politics of the education system, “Waiting for ‘Superman’” is an inspiring documentary film by director Davis Guggenheim, who previously directed “It Might Get Loud” and the award-winning “An Inconvenient Truth.” Both films add major weight to Guggenheim’s resume, but “Waiting for ‘Superman’” might be his greatest achievement to date. 
The documentary focuses on the stories of five children in various parts of the country as they and their parents struggle for a quality education. Much of the film focuses on charter schools as one of the few beacons of hope, despite their lottery systems, which leave many a child’s fate to luck. 
 “The lottery is a metaphor for a good education,” Guggenheim said in an interview with The Eagle. “People in college are the one’s who won the lottery. Millions of people don’t have access to a great education.”
Shocking statistics are presented through cutesy animated sequences to help audiences better understand the numbers involved. However, these quirky cartoons don’t help soften the blow that American kids rank 25th in math and 21st in science among 30 developed countries. 
“Waiting for ‘Superman’” also focuses on other issues such as so-called “drop-out factories” in which few students are expected to graduate, dated practices such as tracking and tenure and the failure of teachers’ unions in protecting bad teachers. 
Despite the bleak prospects, Guggenheim does spotlight several “superheroes,” such as the ‘tough-love’ D.C. Chancellor Michelle Rhee and education reformer Geoffrey Canada, who serves as the main narrator and a significant presence throughout the film. 
“My real passion is that there’s such inspiration in peoples’ stories. People are really moved and transformed when you hear someone else’s story,” Guggenheim said. 
“Waiting for ‘Superman’” is not so much a political film as a heart-wrenching narrative of how children’s education all over the country is subject to fate. The film may present many problems with few solutions, but the narrative is so coherent and appealing that the audience itself becomes part of the solution. 
“Movies can’t motivate policy — inspiring people that it is possible makes it easier for regular people to learn what they can do,” Guggenheim said. 
And “Waiting for ‘Superman’” is exactly that — an inspiring movie that is a call to arms for ordinary people to get involved and fix the public education system. Sitting in a movie theatre makes it easy to forget the reality of the situation, but it takes a documentary like “Waiting for ‘Superman’” to remind people that these aren’t just stories, they’re real life.

From the time that we were prospective students, we have heard about the University’s commitment to public service, social responsibility and community. However, the University falls short of its own sanctimonious spin far too often, especially when dealing with University employees.
On Sept. 30, 2007 AU agreed to recognize and negotiate with the shuttle bus drivers’ union. This came after a long, drawn-out battle with the University in which union supporters’ jobs were threatened and AU administrators tried to sabotage a union election. 
Today, three years later, nothing has changed. The shuttle bus drivers’ union is the only union on campus, and the administration seems determined to break it. The University fights the union tooth and nail and the shuttle drivers continue to feel exploited, abused and discriminated against. Shuttle drivers were not given the same 3.5 percent raise that other University employees were, disciplinary policies are kept secret, shuttle drivers are fired without warning or justification, union leaders are intimidated, and AU refuses to cooperate or compromise with the shuttle drivers.
The shuttle bus drivers have two simple demands: two 15-minute breaks for every eight and a half hour shift and access to the disciplinary procedures that apply to them. These are the same rights that all other University employees currently have. Are these demands unreasonable? No. Is it wrong to ask for the same treatment that all other University workers? No. Are the shuttle drivers a part of the so-called “AU Community”?  Yes.
It is time that AU live up to its own image and pay more than lip service to “community” and “social responsibility.” It is time for AU to stop discriminating against the shuttle drivers and their union and to start treating all of its hard working employees with the respect that they deserve.

REQUIRED LISTENING
Teen Idles - Minor Disturbance: Ian MacKaye’s first release — the few who listen pick up guitars and start playing loudly
Minor Threat - Minor Threat EP: Introduces the world to straight-edge and makes D.C. the American capital of punk
Youth Brigade - Possible EP: Ex-Teen Idles members reform for a year and put out an EP with eight songs lasting 10 minutes
For D.C. natives, mapping the history of one of the earliest and most influential moments in punk rock isn’t any harder than looking in their own backyards. During the ‘80s, the District served as one of the birthplaces of the underground hardcore punk scene, influenced by the British punk rock movement that captivated scads of disaffected youth at the time.  
The ‘80s were as fractured a decade as any to foster the kind of haven that was ideal for punk rock to make its mark. When considering the spirit of the times — solidly in the world of Reagan and social conservatism — rebellion and anti-establishment were attractive sentiments. Musical movements were able to bolster a feeling of camaraderie, which is especially true for punk rock, a genre that not only dwelled in the underground but, out of necessity, thrived on it.
London landmarks like The Clash and the Sex Pistols sang of anarchy and attacked conformity with an intentionally grungy garage-rock style. Here in the States, the Ramones would gain a following amidst the disapproval of people who found their music to be too much of an acquired taste. 
Hardcore Punk 
As punk rock was able to immediately grip punk culture in its budding stages, hardcore punk was also beginning to take root. Unlike the more popular acts of the early ‘80s, hardcore punk bands placed importance on the individual, promoting brotherhood and a strong work ethic. They emphasized the strength of a unified whole as opposed to the sum of its parts, eschewing any corporate powers for help.
Unlike the mainstream punk subculture of patched leather jackets and neon-colored liberty spikes, most hardcore punk acts did away with the flashy gimmickry and stressed the anti-authoritarianism. Their sound was heavier and their subculture was one of intense discipline. Bands typically refused signing to major labels and would instead go on to create their own labels, working from the ground up in the most literal sense. Hardcore punk bands also abstained from self-destructive habits like drugs and alcohol, challenging popular misconceptions of the subgenre.
To speak of hardcore punk without at least mentioning its predominance in the D.C.-metro area would be a major disservice. Here are a few of the most memorable names in hardcore punk.
Minor Threat
If you happen to be in Tenleytown, take a walk down Nebraska Ave. until you reach the Woodrow Wilson Senior High School on Chesapeake Street. You’ll be surprised to know that this was where the founders of the “straight edge” movement got their start. Lead singer Ian MacKaye and drummer Jeff Nelson played for The Teen Idles before teaming up with Georgetown Day School students Brian Baker and Lyle Preslar to form Minor Threat in late 1980.
“Straight Edge,” arguably one of their most iconic songs off their first EP, would instill a key component in modern hardcore punk. With its imploring lyrics — “I don’t even think about speed /That’s something I just don’t need… Always going to keep in touch/Never want to use a crutch” — hardcore punk would be defined by its defiant attitude towards drugs and alcohol.
MacKaye would later form the influential band Fugazi. MacKaye and Nelson also founded Dischord Records, a D.C.-based independent hardcore punk label that allowed them to produce and distribute their own albums. Although they disbanded in 1983, their members still make notable contributions to music and their albums are incomparable in the world of punk rock.
Bad Brains
Formed in 1977, Bad Brains is said to have been the pioneers of D.C. hardcore punk. They gained immediate attention in the underground scene not only for their unusual and diversified sound, but also because they are African-American. They would frequently play shows alongside Minor Threat and other bands signed to Dischord Records but were eventually barred from District venues after a brief scuffle with the authorities.
Their self-titled 1982 debut album had a kind of energy unmatched by hardcore punk bands of the time, brought on by the endless hours of strenuous practice in between school and jobs. Early interviews show that they drew influence from the Sex Pistols, The Clash and even Led Zeppelin. The bands and artists that would later draw influence from them, including Henry Rollins, Smashing Pumpkins and Beastie Boys, are innumerable. Although their style is ever-changing, their fixture in hardcore punk remains the same. 
State of Alert
While they only released one album on Dischord Records and played a few gigs in the course of their year-long career, State of Alert had an influence on punk rock that is still palpable to this day. It was the starting point of contemporary hard rock icon Henry Rollins before he joined prominent punk band Black Flag in 1981. Although SOA’s songs barely registered at the 60-second mark and their “No Policy” album clocks in at a mere eight minutes, their punchy, aggressive style would only be emulated for decades to come by the many branches of hardcore punk.

Alba Vigil, originally from El Salvador, fled to California 20 years ago to escape the civil war in her home country. She came to D.C. a year later and has worked at AU since. 
She said her family started immigrating to the U.S. one by one when the military started getting violent. She now lives near Columbia Heights.
Vigil has been working as a cleaner at AU for 20 years and came here on the referral of a friend, who is also still working here.

Five Facts
• She is the second-oldest of eight in her family.
• She has dual citizenship in El Salvador and the U.S.
• She loves to cook and eat any kind of seafood, except pupusas.
• She likes go to the beach, especially Ocean City, Md.
• She calls herself “crazy,” and says she sings and dances around her house constantly.

• She is the second-oldest of eight in her family.

• She loves to cook and eat any kind of seafood, except pupusas.
• She likes go to the beach, especially Ocean City, Md.
• She calls herself “crazy,” and says she sings and dances around her house constantly.
Vigil now works for Aramark Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., but in El Salvador she was a cook in her family-run seafood restaurant.
Her brother still runs the restaurant there, but the rest of her family is in the U.S.
Vigil became a U.S. citizen last year, with help from her tutors in the AU student-run organization Community Learners Advancing in Spanish and English. The group aims to bridge the gap between the University’s non-English workers and the students through tutoring and community bonding.
Vigil met once a week with her tutor to prepare for the citizenship test, which she said was easy. But to her, learning English is like a puzzle.
While talking with The Eagle, she answered questions in both Spanish and English, with help from CLASE tutors Melissa Mahfouz, a junior in the School of International Service and Aaron Montenegro, a graduate student in the College of Arts and Sciences.
She loves to cook and likes making everything except pupusas — one of the most popular Salvadoran dishes — which are stuffed tortillas similar to Spanish empanadas.
Her two children, now 22 and 26 years old, originally stayed in El Salvador when she came here. But now, her son is working toward his master’s degree in education at the University of Maryland. 
She said there are occasionally problems with student and staff respecting her when she cleans, particularly the men’s bathrooms. However, the majority of the time she does not have any problems.
Without the students here, she would not have work, Vigil said.

The D.C. Student Alliance is planning a community service initiative called Students Serve on Oct. 23.
The day is meant to encourage college students from the D.C.-metro area to volunteer in the community. 
Formerly known as the D.C. Metro University Student Alliance, the D.C. Student Alliance is an organization involving the student governments of 15 universities in the D.C. area that convenes, shares ideas from each school and collaborates on events for D.C. college students.

Fifteen campuses are involved in the D.C. Student Alliance:
• American University
• Catholic University
• Community College of the District of Columbia
• Gallaudet University
• Georgetown University
• George Mason University
• The George Washington University
• Howard University
• Marymount University
• Montgomery College
• Northern Virginia Community College
• Prince George’s Community College
• Trinity Washington University
• University of the District of Columbia
• University of Maryland, College Park

• Marymount University
• Montgomery College
• Northern Virginia Community College
• Prince George’s Community College
• Trinity Washington University
• University of the District of Columbia
• University of Maryland, College Park
Former AU Student Government President Andy MacCracken is now executive director of the Student Alliance, one of the organizations top two positions. 
“The more we can get students to think of themselves as D.C. students in addition to AU students and [George Washington University] students and Howard [University] students, the more unified we will be,” MacCracken said in an e-mail.
The idea of Students Serve came up when the Howard and GWU representatives shared that their schools were planning community service events on Oct. 23, which is National Make a Difference Day. 
The board of directors decided that all the campuses should coordinate a region-wide, multi-campus service activity on that date. The D.C. Student Alliance also decided to do a service event again in late March and planned to continue in the future.
Howard, AU and GW will be hosting the volunteer opportunities on Oct. 23. 
Students of any college campus in the D.C. Student Alliance can register online or just show up on the day of the event to volunteer.
“All the students participating in the service day will wear a shirt that will represent their campus for diverse representation and collaboration,” MacCracken said. “There is a Facebook event for Students Serve, and any student can go from any campus and pick which service site they want to go to. We want to avoid having AU kids just being at AU and Howard kids just being at Howard.”
Service, advocacy and building relationships with D.C. city council members are current and upcoming initiatives by the D.C. Student Alliance to act as a cohesive voice by representing the different campus voices through the D.C. government.
Last year, the organization worked with the Mayor’s Office to help count students in the area for the census.
“The basic idea is that D.C. is a college town, but no one knows it. Students within D.C.’s boundaries represent 1/6 of the population, yet we never think of D.C. as a student-oriented city. We want to change that,” MacCracken said in an e-mail.

Anthony Dunham was elected president of the Residence Hall Association Thursday.
Dunham, a junior in the School of Public Affairs, will concurrently serve in his present capacity as director of the SG Board of Elections.
The president of the RHA works with the executive board and oversees the operations of the department, Dunham said.
He will work alongside the Executive Director of Housing and Dining Chris Moody, the Director of Residence Life Rick Treter, and the Vice President of Campus Life Gail Hanson, Dunham said.
Dunham wants to work towards a greater clarification on issues such as University jurisdiction in the University-sanctioned housing at the Berkshire Apartments.
The RHA will work this year to assure that Berkshire residents are aware of any policy changes and to give them the opportunity to have their voice heard in the RHA, Dunham said.
The RHA will also work to increase community spirit for those living in the residence halls, Dunham said.
“Promoting a real sense of community on campus is something the executive board cherishes and is working towards putting forth its best efforts to make sure programming is diverse and inclusive,” he said.

Eric Reath was unanimously re-elected as speaker of the Undergraduate Senate in the first session of the Sixth Undergraduate Senate last Sunday.
Reath, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, was unanimously elected to continue working as speaker for the sixth session.
He first stepped up as the speaker of the senate April of last year, in wake of the controversies regarding the spring elections and the resignation of former speaker Amanda Merkwae.
Merkwae was speaker during the spring 2009 elections. During the elections SG presidential candidate Nirvana Habash was kicked off the ballot twice for violations in posting campaign-related messages on non-campaign related mediums, The Eagle previously reported.
Amanda Merkwae resigned from her position as speaker of the Undergraduate Senate via e-mail after the election results were certified.
"I can no longer associate my name with an organization that chooses convenience over ethical conduct," Merkwae wrote.
The speaker of the Undergraduate Senate is the chief administrator and advocate of the senate who set standards on legislation and promotes passed legislation to the administration and other SG departments, according to Reath.
Reath said he wants to promote a sense of community and unity within the organization.
"Something I want to end this year definitely is the history of a very negative working relationship with the executive branch," Reath said.
Reath said there were a number of senators last year who did not believe that working with the SG executives was important to the Senate.
Reath said the original Clean Energy Revolving Fund Bill caused significant conflict between the Senate and the executive branch.
The bill was vetoed by former President Andy MacCracken after approval by the Senate. There should have been a meeting to go over the bill beforehand, Reath said.
Reath hopes to change this by fostering a working relationship between the two parties to get more accomplished.
Additionally, Reath hopes to build a community within the senate in which senators view each other as people, not just as potential opponents.
"The sixth Undergraduate Senate is in a great place to step up," Reath said. "We have the greatest opportunity to advocate for the students of American University."
