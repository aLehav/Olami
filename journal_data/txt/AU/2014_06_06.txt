For those who have yet to be swept up in the phenomenon that is author John Green’s teen-centered tearjerker “The Fault in Our Stars”, the premise is simple, sweet and terribly depressing. Two teens, Hazel and Augustus, (Shailene Woodley, “The Spectacular Now” and Ansel Elgort, “Carrie”) fall in love despite the fact that each of them is facing terminal cancer. Throughout the course of the story, they face impending mortality by each other’s side, culminating in a trip to Amsterdam despite the warnings of Hazel’s doctors. 
Green’s novel developed a huge cult following since publication in 2012, mostly among teenage girls, but is widely respected elsewhere. Fans of the novel will be quite satisfied with Director Josh Boone’s film adaptation, as it follows the book nearly word for word. The plot never strays from the novel’s, and, though it would be impossible to include all details that the book included, no major events are left out. 
Woodley is stunning, if not unrecognizable, as Hazel, able to pull off being a 16-year-old cancer patient with a seeming comfort despite being 22. Her exhaustion and emotion is palpable and heartwrenching.
Paired with anyone else, Elgort, a relative newcomer to the film industry, would have been the star of this film, but he is overshadowed by Woodley’s supreme performance. His Augustus Waters is sweet and becomes more believable as the film progresses, peaking at the movie’s climax. 
Other notable performances are Nat Wolff (“Stuck in Love”), who brings a much needed comedic relief to such heavy subject matter, and Laura Dern (“Jurassic Park”), who plays Hazel’s mother with such wisdom and believability that she may just be the most sympathetic character in a film full of compassionate characters. 
The cinematography is well-executed and complementary to the storyline, despite the occasionally awkward vignetted montage sequences. “The Fault in Our Stars” also boasts a great soundtrack, featuring many up and coming artists like Grouplove and Jake Bugg. 
One of the main successes of the film is its ability to incorporate a huge part of any 21st century relationship between teens— text messages. Conversations between Hazel and Augustus pop up along side the screen in a handwritten bubble. This is innovative and important in establishing a reality between the film and its audience. 
Overall, Boone’s adaptation will have its critics, solely due to the devotion of the book’s fanbase. However, as a standalone film, “The Fault in Our Stars” tells a beautiful story with exceptional performances. 
“The Fault in Our Stars” (125 minutes, PG-13) opens in Washington area theaters June 6.

Aliens versus humans. A conflict that is the basis of so many movies that making another would be like beating a dead horse. If so, ”Edge of Tomorrow” is beating that horse a hundred more times, then bringing it back to life.
Directed by Doug Liman, “Edge of Tomorrow” is a “Groundhog Day” meets “Independence Day” fight-fest, with Tom Cruise as the only one that can save the planet from imminent destruction. Other than the introductory montage of news clips about the alien invasion, we are thrown into the middle of the action. The movie begins the day before the ultimate battle that will determine everything.
Cruise plays Maj. William Cage, a cowardly media representative for the U.S. Army that is dropped onto the battlefront against his own will. Out there, he manages to kill one of the aliens, known as Mimics, its blood drenching him before he dies. Instead of staying dead, he wakes up to the start the day all over again. From there, we watch Cage live and die hundreds of times before going from being a deserter to becoming a deadly soldier who is willing to give up everything to help the cause.
The fast-paced nature of the movie expertly emphasizes that time is running out fast for Cage and, with the help of his counterpart Rita Vrataski, he must figure out how to beat the aliens rather than figure out why they are here.
Played by Emily Blunt, Vrataski is everything one could want from a female protagonist. She kicks ass, takes names and doesn’t rely on anyone for anything. Where Cage hesitates, Vrataski goes full force, teaching Cage how to kill the Mimics and, ultimately, doing what he is unable to so that the world can survive.
In all the battle scenes, the Mimics look like deadly, glowing barnacles. They are faster and stronger than any soldier that goes up against them, at least at first. The movie describes the Mimics as an organism rather than an army. If you kill the brain, you kill the body, and somehow Cage has entered their nervous system. Because the objective is so simple, Liman is able to have fun with the plot along the way.
The life and death aspect is taken very lightly, with Cage dying in hundreds of hilariously stupid ways before getting down to business. Overall, the movie never takes itself too seriously.  There’s always time to poke fun at someone, especially Cage, so the movie never feels too grim. While the movie focuses mostly on Cruise and Blunt’s characters, the supporting cast is just as quirky and enjoyable to watch. Although they are misfits by themselves, together they add depth to what could easily be seen as a group of mindless soldiers. 
For an action movie with both sci-fi and military elements, “Edge of Tomorrow” gives us the best of both worlds. The aliens are deadly, Cruise is even deadlier and even after all of chances the characters get, you want to see them make it past the edge of tomorrow.

The title of director Fred Schepisi’s (“Roxanne”) latest romantic dramedy almost gives away too much. 
The story focuses on two teachers, Jack Marcus and Dina Delsanto (Clive Owen (“Children of Men”) and Juliette Binoche (“The English Patient”)), frustrated by their students’ lack of passion in school and their own failures in their professional fields. In an attempt to inspire and to prove words superior to pictures, Marcus, an English teacher, declares war on Delsanto, an art teacher, with their students as soldiers. Much of the passion behind this ‘war’ comes from Marcus’s affinity for Delsanto and romance ensues. 
The issue with “Words and Pictures” is the plot and characters aren’t new. Owen and Binoche play characters that exist in so many other movies. Marcus, though brilliant, is obscene and rude, desperate to keep his job after several infractions but unwilling to change his behavior. He epitomizes a “tortured writer.” Marcus relentlessly pursues the cold, unattached Delsanto as she is the only one willing to challenge him. Both struggle with demons in their personal lives that translate into their work as they try to get students to care about their studies. 
Owen’s acting, though not a poor performance by any means, comes across as Dr. House in a private high school. Binoche does a good job of portraying the frustration her character is experiencing as a medical condition is slowly causing her to lose her ability to paint. However, they are not believable as a romantic pair. 
With the lack of chemistry between the two main characters and both actors’ inability to disguise their respective accents, the audience is extremely aware that they are watching is film rather than real life. This feeling is only enhanced by the overuse of cliches— there are few unexpected moments in the film. 
Though the plot is predictable, “Words and Pictures” is heightened by some quirky one-liners. Screenwriter Gerald Di Pego does a good job of making an otherwise detestable character redeemable through wit, though it is not enough for us to truly care what happens to him. 
Overall, though “Words and Pictures” relies too heavily on tropes that have existed for decades, it is still an uplifting and relatively enjoyable film. 
“Words and Pictures” (PG-13, 111 minutes) opens in Washington area theaters on June 6.
