The American University men’s basketball team has postponed its opening slate of games against Lehigh on Jan. 9 and Jan. 10 after a “Tier 1” positive COVID-19 test within the program, the University and the Patriot League announced on Wednesday. 
The Tier 1 personnel group includes student-athletes, coaches, athletic trainers, physical therapists, medical staff, equipment staff and officials, according to the NCAA’s Tier definition.
This is the second postponement of the men’s basketball season, as the initial opening doubleheader against Loyola Maryland on Jan. 2 and Jan. 3 was postponed due to a Tier 1 positive test within the Loyola program. The Eagles’ first games of the season are now scheduled for Jan. 16 and Jan. 17 against Navy.
Lehigh, instead of facing the Eagles, will now match up against Navy this weekend. Lehigh was not slated to face Navy this season when the schedule was originally released. 
As with the first weekend of postponements, the games between American and Lehigh will be rescheduled following discussion between the two schools and the Patriot League.
The men’s basketball team isn’t the only one dealing with postponements to start the year, as the AU women’s basketball team had its opening games against Loyola Maryland postponed. The team is currently scheduled to open the season this weekend with a doubleheader against Lehigh.
If the doubleheader against Navy continues as scheduled, it will have been 317 days in between the men’s basketball team's last game of the 2019-20 season, and the opening contest of the 2020-21 season.
