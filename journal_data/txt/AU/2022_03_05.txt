You can’t lose in the Patriot League Finals if you don’t make them, and the 2021-2022 American University men’s basketball season is now in the history books.
The Eagles (10-22) fell to the Navy Midshipmen (20-10) 64-71 March 3. The game was a microcosm of AU’s season.
AU started the game on fire. Sophomore Johnny O’Neil led the Eagles’ offensive charge, and his weapon of choice was the three-point dagger. 
The 6’9 forward drained three shots from beyond the arc in the first six minutes of play, and O’Neil’s teammate Elijah Stephens followed suit with a three of his own. 
1st Half | 15:08 | Anyone remember winning a game without hitting a 3-pointer two nights ago?Because we're five minutes into this one and we have four of them. THREE by Johnny O'Neil. 😤AU 14, Navy 7📺 (ESPN+): https://t.co/iK0yq5aPvE pic.twitter.com/ZxR7X8qYgx
AU’s early offensive attack was surprising. AU head coach Mike Brennan’s Princeton offense has traditionally valued getting to the paint more than long-range offense. 
The Eagles made and attempted the fewest three-point shots in the Patriot League during the season, but the change in offensive philosophy seemed to be working in their favor as the Eagles took a 16-7 lead with over 14 minutes left in the first.
The Midshipmen were not fazed by their early deficit. Navy patiently got back in the game with a consistent attack in the paint, and the Midshipmen benefitted from AU’s chronic turnover problem. Navy scored six points in the first 10 minutes off AU turnovers, and the Midshipmen took the lead 18-16 with a jumper from Navy forward Daniel Deaver. Navy buffered their offense output with a militant defense.
The Mids switched from a man-to-man look to a zone defense during the first half that stalled out AU’s offense. Navy had deployed the tactic against AU before with great success, and the Eagles did not score again until there were eight minutes left in the half.
AU senior Josh Alexander got the Eagles back on the board with two trademarked hook shots on back-to-back possessions, all the while fighting off Navy forward Richard Njoku’s stout interior defense. 
AU forward Matt Rogers led AU’s offense the remainder of the half. Rogers is 11th in the Patriot League in offensive rebounds, and his physical play kept AU in the game.
The sophomore took a pass from Stephens to the rim with a two-handed dunk to bring the score to 24-25. Rogers secured an errant shot from AU’s Stacey Beckton Jr. and two of his own misses before laying the ball in to make the score 26-30. Rogers’ also copied Alexander’s example with a hook shot to keep the score a three-point game with about a minute left in the half. 
AU went into the half down 33-30, and Beckton, who also had a thunderous block earlier in the half, tied the game 33 all with a three to start the second half. The Mids methodically navigated their way to a 49-37 lead with 12 minutes left. Navy’s zone continued to frustrate AU’s offense, as AU only scored 10 points in the first 14 minutes, and the Mids capitalized off the Eagles’ unforced errors.

Navy scored ten points off of turnovers, as AU’s chronic concern created catastrophic consequences, and the Mids led by 18 with six minutes left in the game. However, as they had so many times this season, AU clawed their way back into the game. AU had gotten away from shooting threes halfway through the first half and into the second, but the Eagles recommissioned their long-range offense with about five minutes left. 
AU sophomore Colin Smalls drained a three to cut the Eagles’ deficit to 10 twice, O’Neil sank another triple to cut the Mid’s lead to nine, Beckton hit a three despite a poor shooting night and O’Neil’s fifth three of the night nearly brought the Eagles back from the brink of defeat.

With 30 seconds left, O’Neil drained a contested three to cut Navy’s lead to four. AU fouled on the next possession to stop the clock, but Navy guard Austin Inge only made one free throw. 
That's FIVE three-pointers for Johnny O'Neil and it's a four-point game with 30 seconds left!📺 https://t.co/iK0yq5aPvE pic.twitter.com/3IDdPGGDtv
Stephens raced down the court with 26 seconds left to try and chip away at the deficit, but the Eagles’ chances of victory fell out of the sky after the possession fell apart.
O’Neil tried to set a pick for Stephens, opening a lane to the paint for Stephens to cut and O’Neil to roll, but the freshman dribbled away from O’Neil and towards the baseline. Navy’s defense did not buckle as Stephens dribbled to the baseline, and he picked up his dribble and seemed to not know where to pass the ball. 
Stephens handed the ball off to AU senior Jaxson Knotek with about 20 seconds left, who heaved up a desperation three several feet away from the basket. The ball didn’t hit the rim, and Navy secured the rebound to ensure victory. 
“You have to do a lot of things to beat them, a lot of things have to go right,” Brennan said after the game. 
Brennan also said Navy’s stout defense and AU’s inexperience were key factors in the Eagles’ demise.
“Hopefully we stop being young,” Brennan said. “We have to make the play, they’re too good, they recover. So it’s a learning process for our guys.”

A shortage of desk receptionists has caused Housing and Residence Life to close the entrance to Letts Hall each night between midnight and 7 a.m indefinitely. 
The change, which went into effect Feb. 1 at midnight, was announced in an email on Jan. 31. The email said that residents could exit Letts Hall during these hours, but could only enter through the connecting Anderson Hall.
Typically, Letts residents’ One Cards do not work in elevators in Anderson; however, access was recently expanded because the two halls are only connected on the third floor and higher. 
“I cannot express how confusing of a building it is,” said Letts resident Kassidy Jeansonne. “I feel like I’m in a video game trying to get around.” 
Jeansonne, a program leader and senior in the School of Public Affairs, often does not return to her dorm until after midnight due to her job at Bender Library and visits to friends off campus. She said she was returning from the library Feb. 1 when she briefly found herself stuck in an elevator because her One Card was not properly activated in Anderson yet. 
“It filled me with rage,” Jeansonne said.
However, Jeansonne said the elevator did work for her when she returned from work two nights later. 
Joyce Choi, a freshman in the School of International Studies, is both a Letts resident and a desk receptionist. She said that working for HRL has made her more receptive to the change. 
“It is what it is,” Choi said. “I understand the situation so I don’t really mind it as much.”
Choi, who started as a desk receptionist the same day the Letts entrance first closed, found out about the closure during training Jan. 29. SPA freshman Asmita Bhattarai, who started as a desk receptionist Jan. 10, said she found out about the closure about a week in advance. Bhattarai believes there should have been a period giving residents a chance to ask questions about the closure before it went into effect.
HRL told desk receptionists that if closing the Letts entrance at night didn’t work, they would restructure it so it would work better for them, according to Bhattarai. If there were too many issues, HRL told desk receptionists, Letts would reopen at night; if not, the change would stay, she said.
Both Choi and Bhattarai said the shortage of desk receptionists has impacted their jobs. Bhattarai said night shifts at Anderson’s desk are sometimes more hectic when issues arise, since workers now handle Letts residents as well. In January, HRL announced it would temporarily be raising wages for night shift workers by $1.50, a move that has also been attributed to the desk receptionist shortage. 
Bhattarai also said that desk receptionists still have to pick up additional shifts to account for the shortage.
“Even with the desk closed [at night], there’s a lot of shifts that are still open,” Bhattarai said. 
HRL has not announced how long the Letts entrance will continue to be closed at night. A request for comment to HRL was referred to Elizabeth Deal, the assistant vice president for community and internal communication. Deal forwarded The Eagle an email sent to Letts residents attributing the change to “lower-than-expected Desk Receptionist coverage this semester.” 
“We are conducting an updated envisioning of desk coverage including utilizing complex-wide desk arrangements and appreciate your cooperation to ensure the safety of our community,” the Feb. 11 email reads.

American University students congregated in front of the Mary Graydon Center Wednesday night to protest Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and spread awareness about the war. 
School of Public Affairs and College of Arts and Sciences senior Katherine Boyko helped organize the rally of approximately 100 people with the intention of sharing information, signing petitions and encouraging volunteers to help Ukrainians in D.C. by translating legal documents and forms like those relating to immigration. 
Boyko, who lived in Ukraine for 13 years and has family there, said the devastation she felt after hearing the news of the invasion motivated her to organize the rally with the help of CAS senior Kyra Lozynskyj and School of International Service PhD students Anastasia Perevezentseva and James Bryan. 
“When you don’t receive anything from [friends and family] for days at a time, you only assume the worst,” Boyko said. “Since then, you’ve been receiving photos and videos from Ukraine of the cities that have been bombed, and the only thing you can think of is, ‘I’ve been there. I’ve looked at that zoo, I’ve walked through it, and now it’s bombed and now there are tanks going through it.’” 
The demonstration illustrated growing discontent in the AU community over the administration’s lack of response to the war in Ukraine. With schools like Stanford University formally condemning the Russian attack on Ukraine, many students wondered why American University has not yet publicly expressed their support for Ukraine and its people. 
Elizabeth Deal, American University’s assistant vice president for community and internal communication, wrote in an email to The Eagle that outreach has taken place with the international students from Ukraine and Russia.
According to emails obtained by The Eagle, the International Student and Scholar Services hosted a closed meeting last week for students with counseling center faculty, associate deans and Reverend Bryant Oskvig, the Interim University Chaplain.
Daria Morris, a Ukrainian freshman in the SPA, said she wasn’t invited to the meeting because she has a U.S. passport and the event was only offered to international students. 
Boyko, on the other hand, said her professors have been accommodating with assignment extensions and excusals from class. 
As Ukrainian music filled the air, students lined up to sign a petition for NATO to close the airspace over Ukraine and volunteer to help with the efforts of @stayinformed.ukraine, an Instagram page dedicated to combating misinformation about the war and spreading awareness. Rev. Oskvig brought the rally attendees together for an interfaith prayer as the sky grew darker.
“We pray tonight for the people of Ukraine, for their courage, for their fortitude and for the sense that there are people all over the world holding them close in their hearts,” Oskvig said. 
The AU rally comes after several similar demonstrations around D.C. over the last 10 days. Within hours of the initial invasion on Feb. 24, demonstrators, many of them Ukrainian, gathered outside the Russian embassy waving Ukrainian flags and calling for the invasion to stop.
Protesters have also gathered repeatedly outside the White House, chanting and holding signs to demand that the Biden administration impose tougher sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian institutions. 
Some demonstrators called for the United States to increase the flow of military supplies it’s already providing to Ukraine, a step that many European nations have taken in recent days. 
For AU students studying abroad in Eastern Europe, protests over the conflict have been just one part of what they describe as an eerie and disconcerting experience since the invasion began.
“It’s been such a somber, sad mood,” said Alexandra Rainis, a junior in the School of Communication who is studying abroad in Prague. Many Czech people, she said, still vividly remember when Russia invaded their country in 1968. “And so this is bringing back a lot of memories for them,” she said.
At pro-Ukraine demonstrations that she’s witnessed both in Prague and Budapest, Rainis said thousands of people gather and mostly stand quietly in solidarity, with just an occasional chant.
She differentiated between Ukraine demonstrations and her experience attending Black Lives Matter protests in the U.S., which she described as having “a lot more energy and chanting and yelling.”
“It’s a very different experience to just stand in silence,” Rainis said of the protests in Prague. “It’s very quiet.”
Gaby Sosa, a sophomore in SOC who is also studying abroad in Prague, said musicians have been a big part of the protests she’s seen, performing at demonstrations and offering their support for Ukraine between songs.
But she’s experienced a sense of dread hanging over the city too, she said, recalling a moment when she asked the man at the front desk of her Czech school how he was doing. 
“He started speaking about Russia, and how gas prices are spiking up and how things are just gonna start getting worse,” she said. “You could see the concern. You feel the vibe is different.”
Fears of Russian aggression further into Eastern Europe have made what was supposed to be an exciting study-abroad experience into something far more stressful. 
“We didn't think that this was going to affect us because we're students, and we’re very irrelevant to everything that's going on,” Sosa said. “But it seems like even on a small scale, it's starting to influence us.”

American University’s Disabled Student Union hosted a vigil for Disability Day of Mourning in front of Kay Spiritual Center on March 1, which focused on detailing the lives lost because of ableism and the betrayal disabled people face in society.
The vigil was held following months of activism from AU students and the DSU raising concerns about numerous new COVID-19 policies instituted by the University, with students vocalizing concerns about the lack of mandatory testing, issues with masks and classroom requirements. 
The event started with a short speech given by Katherine Greenstein, the president of DSU, explaining the importance of hosting the vigil. Disability Day of Mourning falls directly after Rare Disease Day on February 28th.
“[Disability Day of Mourning] is something we take with incredible honor every single year on March 1,” Greenstein said at the vigil. 
After the short speech, students took five minutes of silence to mourn lives lost to abuse, filicide and other forms of ableism. 
Helena Milburn, DSU secretary, said she hopes the vigil was able to create a safe space for disabled students on campus. 
“I’m glad we were able to remind people that there are resources available for them – that the e-board is there for them if they need anything,” Milburn said.
While being glad and hopeful to be giving to the AU community, DSU members also acknowledged the weight and meaning this day holds for many.
“I would be happy if we don’t have to hold this vigil next year,” Laura Polomis, treasurer of the DSU said. “But that won’t happen, so we will continue to mourn and amplify the voices of our peers.” 
Kaniya Harris, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs and director of Women’s Initiative, was among the students in attendance at the vigil. Harris said she was glad that the vigil was able to shed light on a serious topic.
“My family has always been involved in volunteering and helping the disability community, and I grew up at home surrounded by that,” Harris said. “It’s nice to see students show up for something I feel strongly about.”
Harris also mentioned concerns for the local D.C. community, specifically citing the district’s unhoused population. 
“What AU students don’t understand is that they go out clubbing, maskless, and walk through the streets, potentially spreading COVID to vulnerable populations in our communities,” Harris said. 
In 2019, 36.3 percent of people experiencing homelessness in D.C. were found to be chronically unhoused —– meaning they are people with disabilities who have been experiencing homelessness for over a year. This is one of the highest rates of chronic homelessness in the country. 
The vigil also addressed a lack of action from the University in listening to demands made by students at AU on COVID-19 policies. 
“They have the resources,” said Jackson Beauregard, an attendee at the vigil and a junior in the School of Public Affairs. “We saw AU require mandatory testing twice a week during the minimester, we know it’s not that they don’t have the resources. AU is putting the emotions of AU students before those that require these accommodations.” 
Greenstein also expressed their fear and frustration over the way AU has been handling its COVID-19 policies in an interview with The Eagle after the vigil. They showed frustration in the way AU has handled COVID-19 policies, specifically mandatory testing.
“It’s awful, just awful,” Greenstein said. “The University hears us, but they aren’t listening to us.”
In a statement to The Eagle, AU spokesperson Elizabeth Deal said the University continues to support the AU community and address concerns. 
“The health and safety of our community remains our priority and our protocols, including vaccine and booster requirements and surveillance testing, help support the well-being of all community members,” Deal said. 
Deal said the University encourages students with specific accommodations or health issues to contact the Academic Support and Access Center to access resources for disability-related accommodations.
“AU doesn’t protect us, we protect ourselves,” Polomis said.

U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge discussed solving the current housing crisis for vulnerable communities at an event with the Sine Institute on March 2. 
The event was the second of a five-part seminar series moderated by former HUD secretary Julián Castro, featuring various guest speakers discussing how different levels of government can improve policy to benefit the country’s middle-class and impoverished communities. 
Fudge spoke about increasing access to affordable housing and how she has been working alongside President Joe Biden’s administration to improve the nation’s housing crisis.
“Housing is the most expensive driver of inflation in the country today… because we’ve not invested in housing for more than 50 years in this country, really invested in it, it has finally caught up with us,” Fudge said.
Fudge’s responsibilities as the HUD secretary fall into four categories: Looking at housing through a lens of equity, finding a way to put more low and middle-income housing into the market, ensuring that people who don’t qualify for a mortgage have a level playing field and access to housing and maintaining and improving public housing.
Homelessness has also recently been a major area of focus for HUD, Fudge said Fudge discussed plans and efforts to solve homelessness, mentioning the bipartisan American Rescue Plan that set aside $10 billion to address homelessness and House America, which asks political leaders across the country to commit to providing housing to a number of unhoused individuals.
“We’ve got people all over the country who are making commitments, some cities as many as thousands,” Fudge said. “So we’ve got about 70 communities and cities that are involved in this right now. We just want to continue to grow it.” 
Fudge emphasized the need to expand upon and improve access to affordable housing for low to middle-income communities. She discussed the harms of zoning laws and the restrictions placed upon qualifying for mortgage loans as some of the main drivers of inaccessibility.
Access to affordable housing is much more likely to affect Black people, Fudge said and one way that this happens is through redlining. Redlining happens when a bank denies someone a mortgage loan based on which area within a community they live in, often defined by the racial make-up of the neighborhood. 
Although the Fair Housing Act in 1968 sought to solve these discriminatory practices, Fudge said that the gap between Black and white homeownership is larger today than it was in 1968. Fudge says that HUD is combating this problem through the Fair Housing Act by rolling out a new rule later this spring.
“What we are doing when we don’t allow people to move to communities of choice, communities of opportunity, we are segregating poverty in this country. And as long as we segregate poverty, we are never going to be the kind of society we want to be,” Fudge said. 
Fudge also discussed gentrification during the event. Taxation, zoning laws and urban planning are all factors that lead to community displacement, Fudge said. She explained how in southwest D.C., where she lives, the taxation has been driving people, particularly the elderly, out of her neighborhood due to increasingly higher costs of living. 
“We have to talk about how we keep core communities not just diverse, but fair because people with money will just come in and destroy a community,” Fudge said. 
Fudge concluded with advice to future public servants.
“If you take care of the people, the people will take care of you,” Fudge said, referring to advice that had been given to her by Louis Stokes, the former representative who held her seat in Congress.

American University Archives and the Founders Week Committee showcased an exhibit on the first floor of Bender Library with a comprehensive overview of American University’s history and an acknowledgment of AU founder John Fletcher Hurst’s ownership of enslaved people.
Titled Embracing Change: AU Rising to the Challenges, the exhibit showcased various historical items, including yearbooks, letters and student publications, dating back to the beginning of AU to nearly the present day. 
The exhibit was put together with the work of Founders Director Jeremy Ward, Programming Graduate Assistant for the Center of Student Involvement Madeline Portilla, Michelle Eller and Sarah Graff from the University library and Associate Archivist Leslie Nellis.
The exhibit also noted that Hurst and his family were “active participants in Maryland chattel slavery.”
Check out the new exhibit created in collaboration with the Founder's Week Committee and #AULibrary. Embracing Change: AU Rising to the Challenge. This timeline highlights AU's actions in the face of complex challenges throughout its history. https://t.co/I5jZKQ6gi4
Nellis said conversations surrounding Hurst’s ownership of enslaved people happened around Founders Week in 2018, after a column published in The Eagle discussed the relationship to slavery in AU’s founding.
“So when I talked with my colleagues working on the exhibit, I said that ‘we're going to acknowledge this, right?’ And they said, ‘Oh, yeah,’” Nellis said. “It was definitely a priority of Jeremy and Maddie …  to acknowledge that history.”
The beginning of the exhibit had a chart with a color-coordinated timeline. The color blue on the timeline highlights instances of “War, Peace, and Government” that occurred in American University’s history: green for “Climate Change and Environmental Activism,” purple for “Advancing Gender and Sexuality Equity,” orange for “Racial Equity Milestones” and red for “Global Campus.”
The exhibit contained copies of a few student publications like The AU Women’s Newsletter, News and Views from the International Student Community, The Jewish Pickle, Campus Republican and The Blackprint.
There are also yearbooks from 1931, 1963, 1971, 2004 and 2009 with student pictures, and various campus activities and clubs. The exhibit included a shovel used in the groundbreaking of the School of International Service on June 9, 1957.
The one thing Nellis wanted to include in the exhibit but didn’t make the cut was “ ... a lot of the individual student protests that took place between about 1968 and 1975.” She said there were numerous protests and students had varying demands about being anti-Vietnam War, other domestic issues and the way AU was run.
“We tried to put in some key ones or key ways that actually spurred change on campus,” Nellis said.
