• So I'm pretty sure that the person who told Kerwin to sell his house was joking, seeing as how people laughed after that. But it is partly true about his house being paid for by tuition, since it's owned by AU and all AU presidents live there.
• is it weird that my finger is twitching?
• While I agree tuition should stop increasing, I can't take the CAUS seriously. Making noise outside the dorms and outside the university president's home is childish, not progressive. It's like they WANT to irritate the rest of the AU population.
• Why are men surprised and/or appalled that women partake in no-shave November? So men can grow scruffy beards for the fun of it but women aren't allowed to shave their legs even though they wear pants almost all the time anyway?
• We have too many rich kids at this school...
• @Also, as to Romney taking us back 50 years: if moving “Forward” means killing hundreds of innocent men, women and children in the name of national security, please send me back to the 50s or 60s!! 
-yea because they didn't kill people then either........ god I hate this school sometimes. 
• Am I the only one who's upset about the smoking ban because guys that smoke are SO HOT?
• Where are these millions of CAUS reply rants of which you speak? All I see is overkill CAUS-bashing... Come on guys, be original. This is getting really old, especially for people who don't give a F*** one way or the other.
• I LOVE YOU HAPA
• Can someone who studies art please paint a picture of circus clowns storming the beaches of Normandy?
• That awkward moment when your guy friend likes your ex. Not sure if angry at him, or worried *for* him. . . Maybe both?
• "The eagle just isn't interesting anymore. The articles used to be so much more politically aligned and controversial. Now its just boring news that we for the most part already know. This editor is the worst I've seen in my 4 years here." << seconded
• @But sometimes I wish the best friend would just rape me: Are you serious? Can you maybe not perpetuate rape culture by casually wishing it upon yourself? You're actually stupid. 
• @Was this a Simon and Martha reference: No... it's a That's So Raven reference. I hope I still rock. (I don't even know who Simon and Martha are...) 
• SENDIN' ALL MY LOVE TO E.J. and M. JUST LOVE EACH OTHER!!! 
• I'm the original Marine Corps ranter, and you, sir or ma'am, can blow me if you think supporters of the military "glorify violence."  NO ONE fights harder or sacrifices more for peace than members of the armed forces, and our nation's Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen know a hell of a lot more about violence than you do.  To them, thank you for your service.
• I AM SHIPPING E.J. AND M SO HARD RIGHT NOW
• Smile.  Tomorrow is gonna be a good day.
• A Rant To Myself: You're pretty cool.  You had a pretty sweet time with B the other night.  Maybe soon this will be something.  I know you can quite smoking and you'll start feeling better soon.  Chin up bro, you can do this.
• With all the people talking about dating and crushes I visualize a tiny person in my head telling myself "MAN UP, OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM SO GO TAKE CARE OF YOUR PROBLEM!"....my brain is weird
• to break all this sexual tension I'm reading about, ORGASM!, that is all
• People,
Barack Obama is our president now and we should support him despite the political party we affiliate ourselves with. Let's be smarter than this set of radically polarized politicians in congress, rise above our differences, and hope for more cooperation this time around. God Bless America!
-a fellow bitter (moderate) republican
• @"send me back to the 50s or 60s!!" Okay, I'm not the original poster of this, nor am I going to get involved after just reminding you: the 1950s and 60s led to the Vietnam War. Where our government send its OWN people to die, and in numbers that FAR outnumber civilian deaths in drone strikes. So lose-lose, please stop talking.
• i distrust the blacks
• @"Be a real bro and make this gay relationship happen."  Any more hints as to who you're referring to...?
• @AU needs speed dating: It's called okcupid. Way better than speed dating. 
• So my boyfriend is currently deciding if he wants to stay with me or if he wants to move on and see other people. I'm supposed to give him space while he makes his decision. But the wait is killing me!! What can I do to gain my sanity in the meantime? -losing it
• "Actually it's more than simply tragic..." When I said Romney would take us back 50 years, I meant 50 years in terms of civil rights and social issues here in the states. Obama and Romney presented near identical foreign policies and Romney said he would utilize drones in the same way Obama has. So you pick the lesser of two evils. War is hell, and I pray that we may one day beat our drones to ploughshares, but for now it's a tragic reality. 
• The problem with having attractive friends is debating whether or not you should ask them out or not due to the awkwardness that might ensue... 
• The past  7 1/2 months have consisted of me slowly—but surely—getting over a missed opportunity to be with you, and while tonight might have seemed like a giant step foreword, I was dying on the inside...the things one does to maintain appearances...I so wish I could tell you what's going on, but again, you're the one person I definitely can't. 
• I wish people knew quiet hours were a thing....second straight night I have been woken up by loud biddies...
• @"Um.  So.  I’m a girl who likes a girl who has a boyfriend.  Delusional?" - From experience, most likely. Move on before you get hurt (worse), there are many more fish in the sea who are single.
• "I hope you die screaming"............not gonna lie I was hoping to end the rants on a more cheerful note, but then scrolled down just below yours to see the bold Eagle Rants and blue box.  meep.
• @girl who wants her boyfriend's friend. no you do not want your boyfriend's friend to rape you. having experienced it, rape is the worst kind of psychological torture. it destroys you. it steals your peace of mine and replaces it with paranoia and hatred. you don't want that. you want a commitment free fling, which isn't going to happen. don't you dare try and compare that to rape.
• Hazing. Be above it, not about it.
• I HATE WHEN YOU CAN ANSWER EVERY QUESTION ON THE TEST EXCEPT THE FIRST ONE!!!@$!@$!@#$
• I've drunk myself to the point of blackout for the past 11 days straight. 
• Editor, Is it true there's an eagle rants book coming out?
[Editor’s Note: Not that I know of]
• I'm not good at ice breakers, so the line "I don't think my grilled cheese is even done" was the best I could do on short notice in the tav. It worked, I guess. You came over to me and when I got a better look at you, I wasn't dissapointed
• @girl who wants to get raped by her boyfriends best friend. . . .So basically what you want is to have sex with the best friend without any consequences for yourself. Unfortunately for you life doesn't work like that. No you aren't messed up in the head, but you have an interesting way of expressing yourself. Rape is never a good thing. You do not want to get raped.  
• Im going to get so much flack on here for this, but its not rape if you want the sex to happen (and you give consent). We can argue all day about what constitutes consent, but in that moment both parties SHOULD know when a yes is really a 'yes" and a no is really a 'gtfo with that NO'. If you don't know then neither of you should be having sex.
• omg just dont have sex with the best friend its such a bad idea. Even if you break up with the boyfriend dont have sex with the best friend, that is such bad form.
• Chicken.
• Young teacher, the subject of schoolgirl fantasy....
• If you're going to take your shoes off in class please at least wear socks. I can smell you from across the room.
• To all the professors that take attendance. This is a private university, I pay good money to make my own decisions. If I feel I can ace your exam without attending every single one of your painfully patronizing lectures, please, just let me be. 
• I've spent the last hour watching Rachel Maddow explain how to make cocktails. I don't even drink.
• But props to the Eagle Rants editor for being early for two straight days! Keep it up!
(Hopefully I'm not tempting fate.)
• wait a SECOND, I've seen like 4 CAUS rants and like 50 anti-CAUS rants. so I'm not seeing much of a dramatic debate, just a bunch of people getting mad and agreeing with each other. but submitting eagle rants aint gon change a thing soo if you're upset with the way things are happening, go do something real. 
• @"That awkward moment when everyone thinks The CAUS is spamming Eagle Rants with pro-CAUS rants." Lol go back in your hole CAUS tool.
• As a girl whose first name starts with J, please give the first letter of her last name :)
• I don't care if she's bat$hit insane, I would still sex up Michele Bachmann.
• "Can we start talking again?": well, if it is you, which I'm not so sure it is, but if it is, yes please! Text me or something!
• “Yeah I’m trying. It’s weird when they’ve moved on but you haven’t.”: haha yes, somewhere right now there is someone just waiting for us to come into their lives.
• Whatever problems there are with CAUS, at least they're not outright supporting the tuition increase and telling us it's for our own benefit. Screw you, SG.
• So there is planning for speed dating in February *FIST PUMP*
• Why am I still in love with you? Ugh.

Love, music, old age, generational strife: all of these themes are touched upon in Yaron Zilberman’s (“Watermarks”) somber and meditative piece “A Late Quartet.”
“A Late Quartet” opens with the members of the quarte formed at Juilliard called the Fugues. Peter Mitchell (Christopher Walken, “Seven Psychopaths”) Daniel (Mark Ivanir, “Big Miracle”) and a husband and wife, Robert and Jules (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, “The Master,” and Catherine Keener, “Peace, Love, & Misunderstanding”) are preparing to play one of their final concerts together.
The film then flashes back to a critical moment, where Peter announces that he is in the first stages of Parkinson’s disease and will have to replaced as cellist for the group. Peter’s deliberate retirement sparks off a heated conflict between Robert and Jules about Robert’s wish to be more than the “second violinist” of the quartet, eventually leading to Robert getting into an extramarital affair. Meanwhile, Robert and Jules’s daughter Alex (Imogen Poots, “Fright Night”), an upcoming violinist in the footsteps of her parents, also begins having an affair with her mentor. 
“A Late Quartet,” with its lush, sweeping classical music score by Angelo Badalamenti (a frequent collaborator with David Lynch on soundtracks for “Blue Velvet” and “Mulholland Drive”) is a drama that examines the difficulty a group of musicians have in keeping together in old age.
Walken gives a tragic, if compelling, performance as a man who begins to experience the first painful pangs of Parkinson’s but remains the central heart of the group who keeps them together.
Hoffman and Keener also give rather melodramatic performances, but they are believable as a couple whose marriage is on the rocks.
Most of the movie is filmed in close-up, which emphasizes the drama of the piece, save for a few obvious establishing shots of the city. The crisp cinematography is thanks to veteran cinematographer Frederick Elmes (“Blue Velvet”).
This is Silberman’s first feature film (his previous feature, “Watermarks,” was a documentary about a swim team during WWII). While he does not offer anything quite new in terms of how a conflict threatens to override a group of tightly bound musicians, the way the actors truly deliver heartfelt performances makes it rise above the material written. 
Though the age of the characters makes it seem like the film is aimed at an older audience, its message about how drama can both divide and unite people is universal.

Any movie directed and produced by the legendary Steven Spielberg is going to carry high expectations on its shoulders.
“Lincoln,” Spielberg’s latest creation, is an epic movie chronicling President Abraham Lincoln’s time in the White House in January 1865, just months before the end of the Civil War. The focus of the film revolves around the vote on the 13th Amendment, the abolishment of slavery, in the House of Representatives and Lincoln deciding whether or not to negotiate with Confederate delegates to end the war immediately. The question about which to do may seem obvious in hindsight, but its complexity becomes apparent while watching, leaving even the viewer conflicted.
The complexity of the situation becomes apparent to the viewer while watching how Lincoln handles himself and his decisions. Lincoln is played by renowned actor Daniel Day-Lewis (“There Will Be Blood”). Day-Lewis’ portrayal of Lincoln is superb: brutally honest and humorous, yet soft-spoken and good-natured. Having a British actor playing one of America’s most iconic and well-known people, let alone presidents, is a risky idea. But Day-Lewis lives up to Lincoln’s legacy.
The remainder of the star-studded cast lived up to their roles as well. Sally Field (“The Amazing Spider-Man”), who has acted in an array of award-winning films and television programs, plays Mary Todd Lincoln (Lincoln calls her Molly in the film). Field does a terrific job conveying the paranoid and deeply depressed feelings the former First Lady deals with daily after the death of her son Willy. Her depression adds to the realistic feel of the movie, particularly in scenes that show the interactions between Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln.
Another major character is House Representative Thaddeus Stevens, played by Tommy Lee Jones (the “Men in Black” series). Stevens, historically one of the most powerful Republicans during Lincoln’s time, is portrayed as a cynically funny and righteous leader, and the scenes depicting the relationship between Lincoln and Stevens are some of the most pivotal and well-remembered.  Unfortunately, the appearance of heartthrob Joseph Gordon-Levitt (“Looper”), playing Lincoln’s son Robert in the film, is short. With his name so high on the bill, one would expect him to be in the movie a bit more often. 
One of the more surprising elements of “Lincoln” is its humor. It is easy to forget how funny Lincoln was when his inspirational and thought-provoking speeches are the ones remembered in history (not that this is a bad thing in the least).
Also, Lincoln’s Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn, of the“Bourne” series) has some of the funniest lines of the movie, as do the men Seward hires to sway Democrats in the House into voting for the 13th Amendment. While the subject matter of the film is not funny in the least, Spielberg’s choice to lighten up the film was a good one because it keeps the viewer attentive throughout.
The film’s runtime, at two and a half hours, is a bit lengthy even for the most avid Lincoln fan. The lighting and the camerawork of the film were also questionable at times. Some of the scenes had buildings that looked too modern, and there were even instances where the weather changes drastically without an explanation.
The language used throughout the film was tremendously verbose, and the subject matter shared between delegates of the House of Representatives is not exactly common knowledge. These combined factors could potentially confuse the audience.
In the end, “Lincoln” is a film worth seeing for its historical significance and its honest look into the world of one of America’s most beloved presidents.
