Tenleytown Main Street, a community-based non-profit organization, will produce and sponsor their fourth annual Art All Night event in Tenleytown on Saturday from 7 p.m. to midnight. 
“Art All Night is really about celebrating the District’s creative community and highlighting the diverse depth and breadth of the artistic talent in the District,” said Leigh Catherine Miles, the executive director of Tenleytown Main Street. “In Tenleytown, we fully embrace that.”
Art All Night is an annual, free overnight art festival that is presented by Mayor Muriel Bowser and D.C. Department of Small and Local Business Development. The event takes place in eight different neighborhoods, including Congress Heights, Deanwood Heights, Dupont Circle, H Street, Minnesota Avenue, North Capitol, Shaw and Tenleytown, on the same night.
“[Tenleytown is] one of about 1,200 main streets across the country, and one of more than 18 here in the District of Columbia that focuses on revitalizing our commercial areas and our specific neighborhoods,” Miles said. “Part of that revitalization is the arts.” 
This year, Tenleytown will host over 200 artists and performers in their 19 different public and private venue spaces along Wisconsin Avenue. Each of the locations will be transformed into a pop-up art gallery or performance area. For example, Guapo’s second floor will host a flamenco dancing performance and a comedy club featuring AU students and alumni, which is run by Asteria Entertainment, a group created by AU senior Rebecca Lamis.
The idea to have an event like Art All Night was not a D.C. original, however. The event was inspired by Paris’ Nuit Blanche, a similar overnight arts festival in France, which was introduced to D.C. by Shaw Main Street 11 years ago. Tenleytown entered the list of participating neighborhoods in January 2016. The event has only grown since, with 13,000 art-lovers in attendance last year in Tenleytown alone.
While Miles said that Tenleytown’s Art All Night is for “art-lovers of all ages, of all tastes and all backgrounds,” she still offers her opinions on which events may appeal the most to college students. These include the “Art in DC/DC in Art” at Citizen Heights curation, the “Art Of A Woman” exhibit at the BOLD Center and the outdoor silent disco at the Art All Night Welcome Center in the open lot next to Tenley Bar & Grill on Wisconsin Avenue. 
Tenleytown’s Art All Night even features AU’s Katzen Arts Center as one of the 19 venues, which brings the evening close to home.
“American University is a great partner of Tenleytown Main Street,” Miles said. “The Katzen Art Center [and] the AU Museum will be open for a special after-hours showing of their early fall exhibits, and they’ll have more activities going on there as well.” 
Nicole Martin, an M.A. candidate and the marketing and publications assistant for AU’s museum, said in an email that both students and community members should come to Katzen this Saturday between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. for “make-and-take art activities, light refreshments, live music, ask-me docents to guide you through our early fall exhibitions, as well as pop-up performances from [Professor] Britta Peterson’s capstone class.” 
Beyond the Katzen Arts Center, three of AU’s a cappella groups—On a Sensual Note, Pitches Be Trippin’ and Dime a Dozen—will be performing outside Janney Elementary School between 7:15 p.m. and 8:20 p.m.  
Art All Night is free, which makes all there is to do even better. 
“It’s a fully free event, which we’re really proud of and all the neighborhoods are proud of because it means that your access to enjoy and experience and explore the arts is not determined by your economics, it’s open to all,” Miles said.  
Miles said that if you haven’t been to Tenleytown’s Art All Night, you aren’t seeing the neighborhood at its fullest.
“You can’t possibly fathom the amazing array of music, dance, art, color, vibrancy [and] energy that comes to Tenleytown,” Miles said. “We want to encourage people to come to Tenleytown and experience this neighborhood in a different way.”
Correction: This story previously reported that Main Street had 12,000 programs nationwide. It has been updated with the correct number.

The National Gallery of Art will host their first fall event on Sept. 12 at 6 p.m. NGA Nights, previously known as Nights at the Edge, is a series of community events that take place after hours in the East Building of the National Gallery of Art. 
The event aims to serve those who are not able to make it to the museum during regular hours. 
The night will include a DJ set by DJ Heat, a live podcast with Tracy Wilson and Holly Frey from “Stuff You Missed in History Class” and different art-based activities.
The event will also feature gallery pop-up talks and two learning experiences, Art 101: Introduction to Drawing and Art 101: Color Theory. The experiences will be taught by art educators and are meant to be “an elementary introduction to some art concepts,” said Sherri Williams, the manager of community programs at the National Gallery of Art. 
“We have really great music, talks and activities,” Williams said. “It’s a very lively atmosphere. We’re pulling the veil back on the idea that museums have to be these quiet, contemplative places. You can come in with different access points to the collection, nobody is really telling you what to do or what to see, it’s up to you.” 
There will be two other NGA Nights this fall: Art History Mysteries on Oct. 10 and 1990s Throwback on Nov. 14.
NGA Nights: Back to School will take place on Thursday, Sept. 12 from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm. A registration link can be found here, admission is free.

The change to the University’s health insurance provider has left students across campus frustrated, serving as the latest example of the lack of communication between the administration and student body.
Conveniently announced on May 9, right after finals week ended and summer began, students received an email from Vice President of Campus Life and Inclusive Excellence Fanta Aw, stating that the insurance provider for students had changed from UnitedHealthCare StudentResources to CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield. It was in that email that students were told this insurance plan would be effective starting Aug. 1, and that waiving the insurance would be possible for those with comparable coverage in D.C. until Sept. 20. The waiver and instructions on how to submit it were not sent to students until July 12, in an email from Aw. Following this was confusion on the part of students on the process itself, unexpected waiver rejections and frustration at a premium cost of $1,890.
The Eagle is disappointed with the administration’s handling of this change to student health insurance. The time frame given to students to waive the insurance, when given the amount of difficulty in sending the form in, was unreasonable and students were not properly informed of new processes in approving waivers. The hoops students were expected to jump through with this auditing process, from sending PDFs of insurance cards to multiple days of tech support calls, were not explained.
Before this change, it was up to students to know if their health insurance was comparable coverage in the D.C. area or not. After the switch to CareFirst, some students who may have previously waived the insurance cost no longer qualified during the new auditing process. The process was not explained in the emails from the Office of Campus Life, and as a result, students who may not have done their due diligence were then left with high costs after receiving health care in the D.C. area. The administration has an obligation to communicate all details of something as important as student health care up front and in a timely manner.
These issues are particularly difficult for international students. While American students may have never dealt with insurance themselves, their parents may be familiar with the processes and options for health insurance. Many international students have never had to think about paying for their health care before, let alone comparing premiums, deductibles and coverage. This leaves international students with fewer options and a potential reliance on the University plan. The administration’s communication to international students has failed when they are left uncertain whether or not they can even waive the insurance at all.
The Office of Campus Life has focused on promoting the benefits of the new plan: expanded mental health coverage, enhanced wellness programs and lower deductibles. However, students were very suddenly expected to pay more money on health care than anticipated. The University consistently leaves lower-income students out of the big picture when making these decisions. Taking out more loans is not a feasible solution for students who cannot afford the cost attached to the health insurance plan. It is difficult to go back and even change loan amounts, let alone receive aid without strings attached. 
Additionally, telling students to simply speak to their financial aid counselor if this cost would create more financial difficulties is misplaced and out of touch. This phrasing implies that students have individual financial aid counselors, when this is rarely the student experience. Instead, students meet with the first available counselor who doesn’t know anything specific about their situation, nor have any incentive to advocate in a specific way for that student. The Office of Campus Life did not provide a sufficient safety net for students caught in this change in any of the emails sent to students.
The administration could have taken steps to mitigate students’ confusion and frustration. Not only could the process have been better explained, but waiting until students were off-campus prevented any meaningful student organizing. Waiting until mid-July to inform students of a charge they would be expected to pay on Aug. 1 also prevented students from responding as effectively as possible. There were no discussions held about this insurance plan and no roundtables, which were used in the transition from Aramark as dining provider. Students deserve the opportunity to voice what is most important to them in an insurance plan, and to hear directly what this plan’s coverage offers over others. At the very least, students deserve the respect from the administration that they can be in charge of their own health choices, when fully informed of the options. 
University students, especially those hundreds of miles from home, need to have health insurance. No one needs medical debt on top of student loans. More support and information must be given to students when big changes on campus like this occur, and it is necessary that these systems be improved for student benefit, not administrative.
