In Friday's matchup against Navy (3-4-1), American University women’s soccer (0-4-1) held strong in a hard-fought 1-1 double-overtime draw. Both of the game’s goals came early in the first half, leaving each team searching for the game-winning goal and needing extra time to continue the battle.
The effort head coach Marsha Harper saw from her team was a culmination of the year’s efforts and a look at what’s to come in the future, she said.
“I was very proud of our team and how we came out and played a complete game, defensively and offensively,” Harper said. “The girls were tuned in mentally on a different level. It was exciting to finally see the girls put together everything that we had been talking about. … We made a statement tonight to the rest of the league that this was just a sampling of what we have to offer."
Just 26 seconds into the match, Navy found the back of the net with a goal coming off the foot of Victoria Tran from the assisting pass of teammate Chloe Dawson. The Midshipmen’s early lead served as a wakeup call for AU and sparked an offensive rush down the field for the Eagles.
After numerous close chances, AU got on the board with its first goal of the season in the 16th minute. An arching pass from junior Emily Smith found junior Olivia Mahony as she outran the last Navy defender and slotted the ball into the bottom right corner of the goal. It tied up the game, broke AU’s offensive drought and gave them a reason to celebrate.

In the second half, Navy turned up the offensive vigor and tallied 10 shots in the period, compared to AU’s one. The Eagles were on defense for a large part of the half and successfully kept the game tied, stopping the opposing chances. Of the eight shots stopped by senior goalie Ryleigh Brown, five came in the second half. 
An important sequence in the 56th minute saw the AU backline, led by senior Asia Horne, work as a unit and stop two consecutive Navy shots inside the 18-yard box. The following third shot sailed over the Eagles net and gave them a chance to reset after the string of potentially dangerous chances. 
With time winding down in regulation, the Midshipmen kept play in the AU zone and had everything but the finish as they tried to find the game-winning goal. The ensuing overtime periods saw clutch saves from both Brown and Navy goalie Mattie Gallagher, and the offensive pressure mounted as each scoreless minute ticked on. Neither team was able to connect for the win, ending this game in the 1-1 deadlock after 110 minutes of play. 
Looking ahead
Though Harper was happy with the team’s progress, the Eagles will have to wait until next season to showcase their growth after missing the four-team Patriot League tournament. 
The end of the season also marked the end of several college careers. Brown wrapped up her AU career in goal by cementing her place in the University’s history books. After finishing her 40th game in an AU jersey, she moved into fifth all-time in minutes played as a goalie (3,364) and fifth all-time for saves made (197).
"That's an absolute honor,” Brown said. “Some of the goalkeepers in that stat book are incredible players and being a part of that is such a privilege. The fact that I was able to do it, even with losing pretty much a whole season, is really exciting and I'm just very humbled."
Though she has made her mark on the Eagles as an impactful player and vocal leader, Brown said the end of her soccer career is bittersweet.
"After doing four years at AU, I just wish I had more time,” she said. “I wish I had more time with this coaching staff. I'm super envious of the girls that do. I have so many amazing memories with this team and they're my family now. I'm so excited for them and they're going places."
That first-year coaching staff of Harper and Katie Greenberg now have a season under their belts and have revamped the women’s soccer program within the last year. Heading into the offseason, they will use the lessons of the shortened 2020-21 season as a springboard to hit the ground running next year.  
“We've been able to teach the team our system and how the system can operate in different ways in different games,” Harper said. “I'm really proud of how our team evolved. We talk a lot about soccer and how we can get better as soccer players, but also as individuals. It's more than soccer for me, and the reason I got into coaching was to have our players see that lightbulb come on. I think a lot of our players have started to realize that they have really strong lightbulbs."
Women’s soccer came into the year looking to build a new blueprint for the program. That foundation focuses on attention to detail, a relentless mentality and connecting on both sides of the ball. Friday’s game against Navy was a good look at what’s to come.

Michael Brenner, American University’s Director of the Center for Israel Studies, received the first Salo W. and Jeannette M. Baron Award for Scholarly Excellence in Research on the Jewish Experience. 
Brenner’s research focuses on the State of Israel and Jewish history from the 19th to the 21st century. His multiple publications and books have been translated into 10 languages. A few of his books focus on German Jewish history in the 1920s, which he said is extremely significant today. 
“I think that this aspect of history, unfortunately, has become more relevant in the United States, than what I thought when I started to work on it initially,” Brenner said. “It shows how democracies can fail and how certain groups can be singled out and blamed for economic or political crises. Today, unfortunately, I see certain rhymes to that history.”
AU’s Center for Israel Studies was established in 1998, the first of its kind. The center has created a space to study, examine and interpret Israel’s landscape as a nation and its people. 
“At AU and CIS, we have excellent relations with many different schools and departments, allowing us to do unique interdisciplinary work,” Brenner said. “At the center, we are able to interact with both high-level scholars and politicians for collaborative research and discussion.”
The award was established in 2020 by the University of Vienna and the Knapp Family Foundation, a nonprofit that fosters diverse education in minority communities. The University of Vienna describes the award as the Nobel Prize in the study of the Jewish experience. The Baron Award recognizes and honors the achievements of researchers whose works focus on the relationship of Jewish and non-Jewish people and perceptions of Judaism in the broader societies in which they live. 
The award was named after Salo Wittmayer Baron, who is widely considered to be the greatest Jewish historian of the 20th century. He is best known for his 18-volume magnum opus “A Social and Religious History of the Jews.” As the first professor to be appointed as the Chair of Jewish History at Columbia University, Baron testified at the trial of Adolf Eichmann, one of the major organizers of the Holocaust, where he explained the sociohistorical context of the genocide against Jewish people. Baron’s work strove to integrate the aspects of Jewish history into the wider history of the eras and societies in which they lived. According to Brenner, his scholarship is the groundwork for understanding how Jewish people in Israel and worldwide continue to perceive themselves and others today. 
Brenner continues to serve as a professor of Jewish History and Culture at the University of Munich, where he teaches a semester every year. He had the opportunity to meet Baron during his graduate studies at Columbia University. 
“I was honored to visit him when he was 94 years old, where I got to know him. Personally, I am very touched to be the first recipient of the award that was named after him,” Brenner said. “I am also very attached to the fact that Baron and I both shared experiences of having our lives and academic careers be between Europe and the U.S.” 
In the future, Brenner hopes to study Israeli-Arab relations further and create unique global programs for the Center for Israel Studies.  
Brenner encourages non-Jewish students to participate in Jewish and Israel Studies, where students see the intersection of identities to understand other experiences.  
“Jewish studies is here for everyone,” Brenner said. “For non-Jewish students, it is an opportunity to learn about their own families’ experiences as immigrants or minorities by looking at the Jewish experience in the last 200 years. Rather than being isolationist and looking at one’s own, I think we should understand the relations between two or more groups throughout history and today.”

After the coronavirus pandemic stole Francisco Ferrisi’s senior year of high school and first semester of college, he jumped at the opportunity to move to D.C. when American University announced the Mid-Semester Residential Experience during the spring semester. 
A month into the program, which began in early March, Ferrisi has already noticed the benefits of widening his social circle and living on campus.
“This is like the most human interaction we’ve had in about a year,” Ferrisi said. “I’ve had to introduce myself to like 50 people in the last day, and it’s different from what the traditional college experience would be like. However, it’s something and I think a lot of us appreciate that.” 
One month ago, 527 students moved into single-person rooms in Anderson, Letts and Hughes halls, their home until the Mid-Semester Residential Experience wraps up on May 5. Some are using the opportunity to attend in-person classes, but, for many, the main draw of the MSRE is the opportunity to live on campus and meet fellow students in person. 
Students paid $2,478 for a room and $1,588 for a 100-block meal plan, bringing the cost of the 62-day campus experience to $4,066. According to the MSRE website, financial aid awards could be applied to the costs of living. Ferrisi said convincing his parents to pay for the experience didn’t take much, given they saved money during his virtual fall semester. 
Jehane Djedjro, a freshman in the School of International Service, said her parents were also on board with sending her to D.C., opting for on-campus housing rather than an apartment. She flew in from Los Angeles with her family in early March, excited to experience campus living and meet friends she’d already made through social media.
“I have like a little friend group of like two people and basically every night we just go to every single floor on Anderson and Letts and knock on people’s doors, introduce ourselves and basically form connections like that,” Djedjro said. “Because everyone is sort of on the same playing field, everyone’s open to connecting.”
In addition to the social benefits of the MSRE, Djedjro said she especially enjoys being in the same time zone as her professors and many of her peers. During her first semester of college, Djedjro said she was put at a disadvantage, having to wake up as early as 5 a.m. to attend morning classes. 
While Ferrisi and Djedjro are meeting people in their own dorms, others are taking advantage of virtual and outdoor socially distanced events organized by the Residence Hall Association. On March 22, the RHA hosted two screenings of episodes from “The Falcon and The Winter Soldier” in the amphitheater. Dominic Brunaccioni, a sophomore who organized the outdoor event, said it drew 45 people between the two screenings. 
Alana Cunningham, the social media coordinator for the RHA, attended the event and said that while students seemed to enjoy it and were respectful of social distancing guidelines, the possibilities of in-person events are still limited.  
“I know D.C., as a whole, has increased their outside capacity to 50, but the University has kept theirs at 25,” Cunningham said. “So I think with that limit still being in place and all the regulations being followed, it’s definitely hard to produce and put on any of the events that we used to do last year.”
The University currently houses 767 emergency housing and MSRE students, according to a University spokesperson, the most to occupy campus since administrators shut it down last March due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus across the U.S. 
With an increase in tenants, Fanta Aw, the vice president of campus life and inclusive excellence, said she expects to see a rise in reported on-campus COVID-19 cases. 
On March 15, The Eagle reported that AU’s first confirmed cluster of coronavirus cases had emerged in Nebraska Hall, where students have been living in emergency housing since the beginning of the semester. 
Students told The Eagle that the University has not enforced many of the COVID-19 health protocols MSRE participants are told to follow. 
“They haven’t been enforcing the quarantine guidelines as much as they said they would, which I’m personally okay with because we’re all being tested,” Ferrisi said. “They did kind of like overstate how much they would be enforcing.”
While Ferrisi said his general impression was that students follow social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines while in public areas, he added that he’s seen rooms with up to eight unmasked people.
Djedjro said she’s seen other students enforcing room limits, at times knocking on doors with more than two people, the University’s stated limit, and asking students to disperse. 
“Sometimes the RAs don’t really care, so we tend to get a few more people than the maximum capacity, but everyone always wears masks,” Djedjro said. “We know that, like, if anything, we’re staying as safe as we can.”
Both Ferrisi and Djedjro said that they haven’t seen their resident assistants regularly out monitoring their floor or enforcing COVID-19 protocols.
Tyler Moore, a resident assistant on the second floor of Anderson Hall, said her students are so spread out that monitoring all of them is impossible. 
“I have 25 residents and I’d say about 20 of them are on Anderson North like very, very far away, and then I have five residents that are on this side,” Moore said. “So obviously trying to be present, but also keeping compliant with social distancing guidelines and things like that have been difficult.”
Moore said that so far, she wasn’t aware of any student noncompliance on her floor. If there ever is, she said that the University instructed RAs to ask students to disperse and then call a community director if they don’t comply. She thinks that the University has handled the MSRE well. 
“I really do think that the University is trying to do the best for the circumstances in terms of trying to keep numbers down,” Moore said. “From what I’ve seen, the residents are still able to hang out with each other and still make those relationships … that everyone is yearning for.”
Aw recently told The Eagle that she wouldn’t dispute the claim that the University’s coronavirus rules are lax. She said that rather than policing its residents’ activities, the University wanted to build a shared responsibility for health and safety in the on-campus community. 
She has now clarified that the University does enforce direct, blatant violations of the coronavirus guidelines. 
“If folks are not following those guidelines and we have reports of that … we work with people on making sure that folks are trying to follow those guidelines as much as possible,” Aw said. “And if we find that there’s a lack of compliance and what I call intentional lack of compliance, then it could lead to someone being removed from housing.”
Aw wouldn’t specify how many students have been removed from housing but said none of the removals occurred in the past three weeks. Aw said that removal is rarely the first step and that most students receive a warning, probation or both before losing their housing. 
With only three weeks of the spring semester left, Aw said the University continues to evaluate its coronavirus procedures as it ramps up to fully re-open in the fall. 
“We’ve based them on what we’ve learned from other places. We based them on what we know about the science,” Aw said. “We based them on the guidance from CDC and the Department of Health. And in some cases, we have intentionally been much more prudent in our decisions because we want to make sure the health and safety is the number one priority.”

Chyna Brodie, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, was elected as Student Government president for the 2021-22 academic year with 65 percent of the vote. 
Javon Darrien, a sophomore in the SPA, was elected as vice president with 44 percent of the vote, receiving only 21 more votes than his competitor, Zuby Chowdhury. 
SPA sophomore Maanasi Natarajan has been elected as secretary with about 75 percent of the vote, while Max Rubin, also a sophomore in the SPA, will serve as comptroller. Both ran unopposed. 
Voter turnout decreased by 28 percent this year with 1,541 students casting a virtual ballot and 88 casting paper ballots for the executive board, down from 2,265 votes in the April 16, 2020 election. Turnout increased significantly from the special election in late July, however. 
“It feels good that AU students are behind me, and excited to be a part of this presidency,” Brodie told The Eagle. “It’s not just my presidency, it’s ours. … Through my campaign, we emphasized that this is beyond me, it is about us.” 
Brodie focused her campaign around the tenets of advocacy, community and transparency, and plans to uplift BIPOC voices in every aspect of her work as president. She will succeed current SG President Eric Brock, who assumed the position in a special election in late July in which voter turnout cratered 71 percent from the previous election. 
The election hit an early snag Friday when technical difficulties for the first 45 minutes of voting forced SG Elections Commissioner Sarah Gordon to issue virtual paper ballots for those unable to complete their ballot via the CampusLabs platform. 
Darrien’s campaign focused on reimagining Founders Week and providing more funding for class and school councils and other organizations. SG transparency and accountability were also major focuses of his campaign. 
“I am so grateful and honored to have been elected to this position,” Darrien said. “I look forward to getting started and spending my summer doing the work for this community. There’s a lot of work to do and I am so excited for it.” 
Natarajan hopes to strengthen the dialogue between the student body and SG, while keeping inclusivity and accessibility at the forefront. 
Rubin said that he will bring an advocacy portion back to the position, as well as lean on the work of past comptrollers. He also hopes to expand the potential of the Eagle Endowment grant, allowing for more opportunities when it comes to projects.
More than two-thirds of students voted to modify the school and class council elections to be held in the fall semester in a referendum. While a majority of students voted to modify the senate term to begin mid-fall, the referendum failed without the requisite two-thirds it needed to pass. 
School and class council results are listed below. Unlisted positions had no victor.
