The struggles faced by former AU student Max Durbin, who could not afford to attend the University after he was cut off from his parents for coming out as transgender, raised a central response from readers: What could the University be doing to help students who run into these types of financial challenges? 
One answer: giving students grants from the newly created Kerwin Family Emergency Financial Aid Fund. 
The fund was created to “provide assistance to students whose unmet financial need poses a significant barrier to graduation,” according to a March 2017 issue of American Magazine, the University’s alumni magazine.
Students who have been facing financial difficulties were not given access to the fund until a few months ago because the fund was endowed in late 2017, said Mark Story, the University’s director of strategic communications.
“Endowed funds sit for a year, collect interest and then universities spend the interest from the fund, usually about five percent,” Story said. 
Students who had been facing financial difficulties prior to the fund being endowed were not informed of the fund because “there was no money in the fund and there was not that help even available,” Story said. 
Durbin, who said he was not told about the fund during his conversations with administrators in the fall of 2017, said in September that he was told almost immediately that he needed to transfer when he explained his situation to the financial aid office. 
“They didn’t make any efforts to try to get me to stay,” Durbin said. “There was no effort at all.” 
Although the fund is now available for student use, some students who have dealt with financial struggles say they see the need for more options for students in unique circumstances. 
Zack Pease, a senior in the School of International Service, has been experiencing financial complications since his sophomore year. When he found out that his parents were separating and his dad would no longer help pay for his tuition, he attempted to get loans from the financial aid office.
“The problem with getting loans when your parents are just separating is that their taxes are still joined,” Pease said. “My mom’s taxes and my dad’s taxes made it look like my mom had a lot more money than she does.”
In order to get the help he needed, Pease had to “climb through the ranks” of the University’s bureaucracy, making the process very lengthy and difficult. Ultimately, a professor helped Pease get the loans that he needed to continue at AU, but he is still in a significant amount of debt and believes that there should be more options made available to students facing these types of challenges. 
“It doesn’t seem like there is a lot that AU can do when people have a sudden financial change,” Pease said.
While the Kerwin Fund is now available to help students with financial difficulties, the process for how students can obtain grants from the fund is still unclear because the financial aid office has not awarded any money from the fund yet, Story said. There is no application necessary, he added. 
“The financial aid office reviews all appeals for additional assistance and attempts to leverage all funding at its disposal to meet the needs of students who are appealing for additional assistance,” he said. 
Both Durbin and Pease said that they recognized the limitations of the University to address financial issues, since most need-based aid comes through the federal government. But they hope to see AU do more for students who face these types of issues. 
“The AU financial aid counselors were nice, but they can only do so much,” Pease said. “There’s a certain point with certain people when you shouldn’t go by the book.”

Inside fenced off construction next to Bender library, McKinley in the background.
Last fall, construction began to replace outdated steam pipes with energy-saving Low Temperature Hot Water (LTHW) piping system. Each campus building will need to be connected to the new system, a move that will AU’s carbon emissions. The scope of the project was described as “massive” by David Dower, AU’s assistant vice president for project management. 
The project will minimize the University’s carbon footprint by nearly 50 percent and will save AU around $1.5 million per year in energy costs.
With all of these benefits, there have also been multiple downsides to the extensive construction project. Beyond being just a general inconvenience, the construction has posed an unnecessary strain upon community members with accessibility issues due to lack of communication from the University. Mobility-impaired people are left to largely fend for themselves as the landscape of the campus grounds continue to shift, blocking off routes and paved roads. 
Further, in the case of an emergency, The Eagle is interested in what, if any, alternate plans exist for those buildings with obstructed routes to safety. Already, the University has faced an evacuation due to a fire near Hughes Hall. If there are alternate plans for how to evacuate campus, students deserve to know about them. 
According to administrators, LTHW construction on the south side of the campus is set to be finished by April. It will then gradually shift toward the north side of campus. However, AU has a track record of failing to meet timetables and deadlines. For example, East Campus construction was delayed for several months before students could move into their dorms. 
For those graduating in May, what will this mean for the “massive” influx of proud family members reasonably expecting to be able to get to commencement ceremonies? Will the construction be done in time?
There are also open questions about in what impact the construction may have upon tours and applications to the University, especially given the University budget is tuition-based. 
We recognize that the construction, whether that be LTHW or the new Hall of Science, are extremely beneficial for our university and its future students, particularly those studying sciences. 
At the same time, we must confront that one of the primary allures of our campus is its natural beauty. Critters like rats are being disturbed by the construction, making appearances in living space as well as eating space. Additionally, the University is plagued by lack of parking space, and construction has exacerbated the issue.
In the end, the issue also comes down to communication from the University. Putting our heads down and enduring the minor inconveniences might work for the short term, but the long-term prospects of this project necessitate the University communicate in an effective and timely manner.
The University should address what recourse exists for members of our community with accessibility needs. It should communicate what the alternate plans for emergency evacuation of buildings affected by construction. It should be upfront about backup plans for unavoidable delays like the quickly incoming winter season as well as the consequences the disturbance has had upon the arboretum’s ecological health.
It is imperative that the University communicates this urgently and openly to address the sincere concerns of community members with accessibility needs, but also to sell the importance of the undertaking to large portions of students who might otherwise see it as a ‘“massive” inconvenience.

Yilret Yiljep, pictured dunking during a high school game, had to give up playing basketball at AU due to a heart condition diagnosis. Now he's back on the court as a graduate student. 
His journey began in Kaduna, Nigeria. Yilret Yiljep – known by his teammates and friends as “YY” – played for the Nigerian U-16 national basketball team. He then moved to West Chester, Pennsylvania to play in high school and was recruited by AU during his senior year.
The 6-foot-7 forward took the court for 13 games his freshman year, averaging 2.5 points per game, 2.1 rebounds and 1.2 assists in the 2013-2014 season. 
But that all came to a grinding halt during his 13th game as a freshman. Yiljep began to notice that something was not right. 
Thirteen minutes into the game against Holy Cross, Yiljep said he found it harder and harder to breathe. He had recorded four points, three rebounds and two assists before coming out.
“The symptoms were shortness of breath and instant fatigue,” Yiljep said. “I was getting tired after a couple of seconds.”  
The diagnosis came shortly after: cardiomyopathy. Yiljep’s season and undergraduate career were cut short due to the heart condition, which makes it difficult for the heart to deliver blood to the rest of the body. 
“It was really tough to take in because basketball means a lot to me,” Yiljep said. “But I had great teammates and a very supportive coaching staff as well. Applying myself in a different role and trying to help the team as much as I could and being as involved as possible really helped me ease the pain.”
Mike Brennan, the head coach of AU men’s basketball, said Yiljep took on the role of a student coach and mentor. 
“He was helping young guys through practice and working with them on things that he had been working on, and he continued to be a strong voice in the locker room,” Brennan said.
Yiljep said his time as a student coach allowed him to see the game from a different perspective. 
“I was telling the guys what I saw from the bench and what they needed to work on,” Yiljep said. They valued my opinion.” 
Yiljep’s life moved on outside of basketball. He graduated in 2017 with a degree in business administration and found a job in nearby Chevy Chase. But his ability to work out and play the game he loved was still limited. 
“I was told to dial everything down,” Yiljep said. “I could shoot jumpshots, but I couldn’t do anything to the point of exhaustion. Everything I did was monitored. I had to keep my heart rate under a certain level.”
But last fall, Yiljep found out some surprising news: doctors told him his heart was in good shape. He no longer had to work out with restrictions and, best of all, he could play basketball again. 
“I was overwhelmed, I was so happy,” Yiljep said. “Since I found out about the diagnosis, I had been living with caution every day. Every day when I was going up the stairs and my heart rate goes up, I got scared that maybe my heart was going to fail. Every day I had to take heart meds, and it was a constant reminder that there was something wrong with my heart.”
On Oct. 1, Yiljep was medically cleared to resume all athletic activities and compete for the Eagles in the 2018-19 season as a graduate student. The NCAA and the Patriot League approved a waiver request from AU that granted Yiljep an additional season of eligibility given his special circumstances. 
Yiljep said that no longer having to take daily medication and knowing that he can participate in physical activity without restrictions has been liberating. Playing basketball, he added, is “just another huge bonus.”
Brennan, who has known Yiljep for over five years, said he was happy to see the forward get his playing opportunity back. 
“It’s a big blow to a young kid when your whole life is basketball and then it’s taken away,” Brennan said. “The maturity level back when this happened, for a kid that young to handle this adversity as well as he did, and to continue to be such a positive influence speaks to who he is.”
Since he has been away from the hardwood for over three years, Yiljep is primarily concerned with his physicality entering his final season. He said that getting back in shape for the season was “a race against time.” 
What’s most important to Brennan is that Yiljep goes out and has a good time in his final season at AU. 
“I want him to go out there, have fun, play hard and do the best he can,” Brennan said “I think if he does that, he’ll have a big impact on our team.” 
In AU’s season opener at George Mason University on Nov. 9, Yiljep showed signs that he could play consistent minutes for the Eagles this year. He not only started the game against the Patriots, but was on the court for 21 minutes, notching a steal and a block for the Eagles in their 78-75 overtime win. 
Yiljep said that not being ostracized by the team after he was forced to sit out season after season and surrounding himself with understanding people has driven him throughout his journey back to the court.
“This all just reminded me of how much I love the game of basketball,” Yiljep said. “Having it taken away from me was a challenge that I never quite got over, and getting the opportunity to play again makes me realize that dream.” 
“A part of me felt like it was missing when I wasn’t playing, and now being able to play again, I feel more complete.”

“Juuling” for American University students has become a typical part of college life, with vape pens appearing everywhere on campus from the Mary Graydon Center to restrooms and classrooms.
Juuls are small, discreet e-cigarette vapes that resemble flash drives and can have little to no scent or fruity and minty flavors. They can be charged in a USB port of most laptops and portable chargers. Juuls, unlike cigarettes, are easier to hide and according to AU students, more socially accepted by young people.
“I don't Juul, but there are always kids in my classes just charging their Juuls,” said Sarah Gruesser, a sophomore. 
Noah Sanger, a junior, said he began smoking Juul his senior year of high school. Sanger now smokes around a pod a day, which has about the same nicotine content as a pack of cigarettes. 
Sanger had never smoked a cigarette before Juuling. Instead, he began smoking cigarettes on occasion while studying abroad in addition to using his e-cigarette every day. Sanger said he spends about $20 every four days on his Juuling habit. 
“No one’s like pushing Juul on me, but also no one’s trying to stop me from doing it,” Sanger said. “If I was on cigarettes, people would actually give me looks, but when I use Juul, it's like ‘oh he's just Juuling, whatever.’” 
Some stigma still appears to be attached to Juuling, as several students approached about using Juuls declined to be interviewed on the record about their use of the product. 
Juul sales are boosting the e-cigarette market, with the market expanding by 40 percent in 2017 to become worth about $1.16 billion.
While D.C.’s tobacco recently implemented a law that prohibits the purchase of tobacco products by people under the age of 21 in addition to a high tax on tobacco products, Juul users at AU say it’s not difficult to get. Juul pods can be purchased online or bought by older friends.  
The company promotes itself as a way for adult smokers to reduce their cigarette or eliminate their cigarette consumption. However, some AU students who juul say they had not consumed nicotine before picking it up. 
AU is considered a tobacco and smoke-free campus, according to its initiative website as well as signs around campus. However, according to students, there seems to be little to no consequences for juuling. 
Hannah Camp is a senior at AU who studies public health and women gender and sexuality studies. Camp is also a Peer Health Educator at the Health Promotion and Advocacy Center. 
“We’re technically supposed to be smoke and vape-free but people don’t care,” Camp said. “I saw someone the other day Juuling in the library.”
While AU links to some resources outside of AU on the tobacco-free section of the University’s website, nicotine is not mentioned in the alcohol and drugs section of the Health Promotion and Advocacy Center’s peer education website.
Yoo-Jin Kang, the coordinator for alcohol and other drugs at HPAC, is the main point of contact for addiction issues and can direct students in need to resources. 
Camp said that nicotine came up in her training at HPAC but often they talk about harder drugs, which they consider to be a more pressing issue. She thinks based off of her public health classes and experience that prevention and education are always the best efforts. 
“If you’re doing it, at least know what you’re doing,” Camp said. “People are always going to do unhealthy things but that knowledge is 80 percent of the battle.”
