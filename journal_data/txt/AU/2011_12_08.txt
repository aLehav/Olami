•My professor still hasn't entered the A grade I got on a paper 2 months ago. I talked to him about this and emailed him. He said he would enter it when I asked him about it 3 weeks ago.
This makes the difference between an A and a B+. What should I do???
•@you're wrong to have a LDR. I'm guessing you did not have a good LDR experience. My boyfriend lives in a different country and while the distance is hard, there is nothing wrong with giving it a shot and sticking it out for someone you really love. Better luck in love next time.

Direct your anger or requests at a specific target and things might actually change.

•If you're an Econ MASTERS student you should be able to pronounce ARBITRAGE.



•As interesting as it is listening to you talk to your girlfriends about all the crazy things that happen to you "down there", you probably should discuss that kind of stuff elsewhere. also, look up the meaning of 'discretion'.
•@anti-smokers--so, you think that carbon monoxide just stops at the streets.  You are a moron.  Obviously you never took chemistry or physics.
•I enjoyed the Eagle article about how internships are way overblown (and often useless or counterproductive). People who waste their time in internships doing menial labor instead actual taking classes expanding their minds make me very sad. College is for intellectual growth. You have your whole life post college to work. Take advantage of all the amazing professors here while you can.
•I love how upper-middle class whites concur in their smug fawning over Nicholas Kristof...nicely done ER editor
•Dear Roommate: The phone is an incredible invention. Believe it or not, you DON'T need to yell loud enough for your mother in Colorado to hear you without the technology. Indoor voice, darling.
•A jog for a first date in the winter...bad idea. Maybe during Cherry blossom time...maybe. Assuming the chick is fit and let's be honest....this is AU we're talking about so that's as likely as correctly formatted rants.
•True that to the long distance relationship comment. Absolutely the single dumbest thing a person can do while in college. #regretslaterinlife

•Dear "#richgirlproblems" whose trust fund hasn't come in yet,
Some of us actually have to do something I'm sure you're not aware of called "work" to get our money instead of waiting around for someone else's money to come in. Here's some advice while you're waiting, get some real problems.

•Dear fellow biddies, let's save our biddie-ing for the weekend. I have to study for finals.

•@Person in American Political Parties Class ranting about a girl in there class: omg there's a girl like that in my World Politics class. I want to bang my head on my desk whenever she asks a question (i.e. rambles on forever without making a point with far too many likes and ums)
•@Girl who doesn't want us to have a football team because of bro-y jocks: Newsflash. AU has them, just enjoy their (well some of them) hotness and don't talk to them.
•To the person who called out frat boys as unintelligent. In spring 2011 the average Fraternity man had a higher gpa than a non-affiliated male. In fact, my gpa rose while I pledged. Don't hate.
•@I hope the students complaining about events in Katzen aren't scholarship students:
How are a private (elementary-middle) school fair, a wedding, and a magazine release related to scholarship donors? You're crazy if you think every event held there is related to AU. They rent to building out to PRIVATE functions and don't tell students when these events are happening.
•We beat St. Joe's in basketball!!! Maybe we'll have a spectator sport's team to root for after all(sorry, elite wrestling program, not as good of a spectator sport)!!!
•Confused by eye contact. What does it mean??!! I'm worried that I've accidentally been flirting with people because of my type of eye contact.

•To the person who is complaining about the Dav not having soy milk: I'm a vegan and proud customer of the Dav - they run out sometimes, and that it is OK... that's what happens when you're the best coffee shop (or any place) on campus and EVERYONE goes there. All the time. Nonstop. It happens.
•I will take your 29 pages and raise you 43 pages.  And it's only Tuesday.
•You know what I wish we had more of? Petty, shallow, pedantry to read in the Eagle Rants. It just seems to be lacking

•YES! MEMES! Someone in Leonard has a trollface in their window. I want to meet them!!
•"Ohhhhh my gooood! Im awake!"
"Wow! Im awake too! This is awesome!"
•@ "jogging as a first date" responses. We both run, and at times I feel like it would be a good idea, but i prob wont end up doing it. there are better options out there. btw, did any of you guys read the other answers? your opinions varied from one extreme to the next haha.
•On the subject of favorite memes, mine's Forever Alone.  Because it's true.  And funny.
Just in case you were wondering.
•@"That awkward moment where a guy keeps inviting you over to watch movies when you aren't interested."
AMEN. If I wasn't absolutely sure I had not written this, I would have thought I wrote it.
•My day has been horrible, but I just realized that I am so thankful for all that I have in my life, I have no right to be sad.
•@#winning...I don't believe you.
•All of the people ranting about Eaglesecure probably never experienced the 8th Circle of Hell that Eaglenet used to be.  I enjoy not having to watch all of my netflix in 30 second increments this semester.
•What events that thank those who donors? Sure there are some but most are private events that have no connection to the university. It's not that AU hosts events in Katzen, it's that the students are never told when these events are going to happen and are turned away from their rightful practice/work/study space without warning.
•@jog on first date
I think it's fine to ask her to go on a jog with you, assuming you know that she enjoys jogging or you have talked about jogging with her and she has expressed interest in trying it out with you. Otherwise, she may take it to mean that you think she is fat and needs to exercise.
•The Eagle doesn't publish anonymous columns anymore? Why not? No wonder we have no frickin sex column. Let the person who wants to write an anonymous sex column do it! Eagle is not in a position to be turning down eager writers. And it's not like he (or she) will be anonymous to the Eagle staff? No anonymous sex columns? Sheesh what is the world coming to? Who is going to volunteer to write a sex column in their real name? NO ONE. Get with it Eagle.
[Editor’s note: The writers of the sex column this fall and last year both used their real names. The lack of anonymity was not a deterrent for them.]
•Dear girl worried you are his booty call: If his facebook doesn't list you as his girlfriend and you are hooking up with him, you're his booty call.
•@"You're wrong to have a long distance relationship" Sorry you're jealous that your long distance relationship didn't work out while other people's did. I've been in a wonderful long distance relationship for 4 years now. 4 more years to go while as my bf just started med school. And I have no doubt at all that we will make it.
•@"All the normal people who read these" First off, it's sad that you pride yourself on being "normal". Have fun with your average life. Secondly, actually eagle rants were created exactly for relationship issues and policy debates. Get a clue.
•That time where you think you might be pregnant during finals...EFF my life.
•@AU students graduate with the MOST DEBT IN DC.AU IS NOT DOING ENOUGH." You need to work on understanding correlation vs causation. AU could be giving out tons more financial aid than GW and Georgetown but if Georgetown and GW and filled with more upper class students who don't need financial aid whereas at AU there are more middle class students, then that puts more strain on AU.
•@ AU doesn't do enough: You are wrong. Props to AU for accepting a financially diverse student population, when they could easily just select the rich kids and no longer be called the number one highest debt college in DC.
•Women needs to quit trying to make the marginalized male population from conforming to their standards.
•@"My career as an undergrad will be ending in 9 days, and somehow I've made it out of college without writing a paper longer than 10 pages. #winning" You must be a business major.

•@Aspiring drag queen: Athena's on facebook, friend her!
•i didn't hate AU until they got new academic regulations. NOW I NEVER WANT TO RETURN FROM ABROAD OMG.
•This I feel like is a legitimate complaint, why doenst AU have a Fall/Spring Fest type weekend, or day, where we bring a cool musical act to campus, and have them perform on the quad? Plenty of other schools have this, and it seems awesome.
•I keep seeing rants that sound exactly like they could be my ex and getting mildly concerned....
•If you came from North/Upstate NY to DC, you have NO right to complain about the lack of snow. Did you not realize you were going SOUTH?
•dear x & y...good luck
•Dear boyfriend,
I love you very much, but it is time for you to do some "oh-my-gosh thanks for putting up with me" loving. I would like it to come in the form of home-made chocolate chip cookies.
Sincerely,
Your Overly Supportive Girlfriend
•lol the poor kid wondering about the jogging date is probably more confused than ever...
•@AUConservative: I feel like that sometimes but I hail from liberal NJ so I'm used to it.
•I have major, major issues with my professor right now. Like built-up, long-term, legitimate resentment. I'm not an angry person, either.
•12 days of the holidays at the phonathon = LOTS OF BONUS BUCKS!!!
•Can we talk about the unobservant AU students at the intersection of New Mexico and Nebraska for a minute??? When the traffic across Nebraska stops, it DOES NOT automatically mean it's your turn to cross to and from SIS and the Nebraska Parking lot. If you didn't notice, there is now a garage at SIS and those people have right of way for about 10 seconds before your stupid people get to cross the street. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION. Walking when there isn't a walk sign doesn't make you an acclimated DCist; in this case, it makes you an idiot! Seriously!
•@"Looking for a nice Jewish girl. A nice one. A cute smiley one" - You're looking for every single brother in AEPi ;)
•Are there no boys out there who like a cute chubby girl? I've been slaving away at the gym, but nothing :[
•You led me on, I kinda fell for you, and now you just want to be my "friend"? If only I could change your mind...

•I want to do naughty things with my TA. Let it be known.
•Is it bad that I really want a girlfriend to go on springbreak with? And that this is actually bugging right now? :/
•Thank you AU for putting hazardous metal bars and AC's near my bed so that every time I move or try to get comfortable I hurt myself.
•Why is it so hard to approach a beautiful girl who is always surrounded by a group of people.

•@Beware the Jabber WONK... can we be friends? I just died laughing.

•@"Take some Midol and get over yourself": Good for you that you don't have hormone issues! Some of us (actually a lot of us- you'd be surprised) have any number of a plethora of medical problems that cause intense emotional imbalance during "that time." We are trying our best not to annoy you while we are going crazy on the inside, so please don't demonize us.

•That awkward moment when you realize that Elian Gonzalez is no longer a cute little boy, but an extremely attractive adult.
•According to wikipedia, Neil Kerwin made $1.4 million in 2007-2008. He drives his car to campus every day and DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING. Meanwhile, students who are being put thousands of dollars in debt and campus workers who make meager hourly wages have to pay exorbitant amounts of money in order to park a car on or near campus. Really, Kerwin? You can't spare 350 bucks  a semester out of your one and a half million dollar salary?
[Editor’s note: To make the record clear, Kerwin doesn’t have a $1.5 million salary. Kerwin made $760,774 in 2008, which included his $480,609 base compensation, plus deferred compensation, health benefits, etc. In 2007, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Kerwin made $1.4 million, which included a $600,000 salary and other compensation. About $800,000 of that compensation was a portion of Kerwin’s earnings that were placed in a trust in 2000 when he was provost. He couldn’t withdraw any of those funds until he had served nine years with AU.]

•If you're an Econ MASTERS student you should be able to pronounce ARBITRAGE.
•As interesting as it is listening to you talk to your girlfriends about all the crazy things that happen to you "down there", you probably should discuss that kind of stuff elsewhere. also, look up the meaning of 'discretion'.
•@anti-smokers--so, you think that carbon monoxide just stops at the streets.  You are a moron.  Obviously you never took chemistry or physics.
•I enjoyed the Eagle article about how internships are way overblown (and often useless or counterproductive). People who waste their time in internships doing menial labor instead actual taking classes expanding their minds make me very sad. College is for intellectual growth. You have your whole life post college to work. Take advantage of all the amazing professors here while you can.
•I love how upper-middle class whites concur in their smug fawning over Nicholas Kristof...nicely done ER editor
•Dear Roommate: The phone is an incredible invention. Believe it or not, you DON'T need to yell loud enough for your mother in Colorado to hear you without the technology. Indoor voice, darling.
•A jog for a first date in the winter...bad idea. Maybe during Cherry blossom time...maybe. Assuming the chick is fit and let's be honest....this is AU we're talking about so that's as likely as correctly formatted rants.
•True that to the long distance relationship comment. Absolutely the single dumbest thing a person can do while in college. #regretslaterinlife
•private school kids
•Dear "#richgirlproblems" whose trust fund hasn't come in yet,
Some of us actually have to do something I'm sure you're not aware of called "work" to get our money instead of waiting around for someone else's money to come in. Here's some advice while you're waiting, get some real problems.
Sincerely,
Everyone
•Dear fellow biddies, let's save our biddie-ing for the weekend. I have to study for finals.
•So I deactivated my Facebook in order to have to distractions during finals and with the multiple papers I have due..... and yet, I've spent all my time I'd normally spend on Facebook on EagleRants.... #procrastinationproblems
•@Person in American Political Parties Class ranting about a girl in there class: omg there's a girl like that in my World Politics class. I want to bang my head on my desk whenever she asks a question (i.e. rambles on forever without making a point with far too many likes and ums)
•@Girl who doesn't want us to have a football team because of bro-y jocks: Newsflash. AU has them, just enjoy their (well some of them) hotness and don't talk to them.
•To the person who called out frat boys as unintelligent. In spring 2011 the average Fraternity man had a higher gpa than a non-affiliated male. In fact, my gpa rose while I pledged. Don't hate.
•@I hope the students complaining about events in Katzen aren't scholarship students:
How are a private (elementary-middle) school fair, a wedding, and a magazine release related to scholarship donors? You're crazy if you think every event held there is related to AU. They rent to building out to PRIVATE functions and don't tell students when these events are happening.
•We beat St. Joe's in basketball!!! Maybe we'll have a spectator sport's team to root for after all(sorry, elite wrestling program, not as good of a spectator sport)!!!
•Confused by eye contact. What does it mean??!! I'm worried that I've accidentally been flirting with people because of my type of eye contact.

•Ugh, my iPod keeps cutting off songs before they finish and I have no idea why. They play fine on my computer. /firstworldproblems
For once, a yay!rade: THANK YOU, PROFESSOR, FOR MOVING BACK THE DUE DATE FOR OUR FINAL PAPER. YOU ARE MY FAVORITE.
•To the person who is complaining about the Dav not having soy milk: I'm a vegan and proud customer of the Dav - they run out sometimes, and that it is OK... that's what happens when you're the best coffee shop (or any place) on campus and EVERYONE goes there. All the time. Nonstop. It happens.
•I will take your 29 pages and raise you 43 pages.  And it's only Tuesday.
•You know what I wish we had more of? Petty, shallow, pedantry to read in the Eagle Rants. It just seems to be lacking
•That awesome moment when two of the rants apply to you floor...
•YES! MEMES! Someone in Leonard has a trollface in their window. I want to meet them!!
•"Ohhhhh my gooood! Im awake!"
"Wow! Im awake too! This is awesome!"
•@ "jogging as a first date" responses. We both run, and at times I feel like it would be a good idea, but i prob wont end up doing it. there are better options out there. btw, did any of you guys read the other answers? your opinions varied from one extreme to the next haha.
•On the subject of favorite memes, mine's Forever Alone.  Because it's true.  And funny.
Just in case you were wondering.
•@"That awkward moment where a guy keeps inviting you over to watch movies when you aren't interested."
AMEN. If I wasn't absolutely sure I had not written this, I would have thought I wrote it.
•My day has been horrible, but I just realized that I am so thankful for all that I have in my life, I have no right to be sad.
•@#winning...I don't believe you.
•All of the people ranting about Eaglesecure probably never experienced the 8th Circle of Hell that Eaglenet used to be.  I enjoy not having to watch all of my netflix in 30 second increments this semester.
•What events that thank those who donors? Sure there are some but most are private events that have no connection to the university. It's not that AU hosts events in Katzen, it's that the students are never told when these events are going to happen and are turned away from their rightful practice/work/study space without warning.
•@jog on first date
I think it's fine to ask her to go on a jog with you, assuming you know that she enjoys jogging or you have talked about jogging with her and she has expressed interest in trying it out with you. Otherwise, she may take it to mean that you think she is fat and needs to exercise.
•The Eagle doesn't publish anonymous columns anymore? Why not? No wonder we have no frickin sex column. Let the person who wants to write an anonymous sex column do it! Eagle is not in a position to be turning down eager writers. And it's not like he (or she) will be anonymous to the Eagle staff? No anonymous sex columns? Sheesh what is the world coming to? Who is going to volunteer to write a sex column in their real name? NO ONE. Get with it Eagle.
[Editor’s note: The writers of the sex column this fall and last year both used their real names. The lack of anonymity was not a deterrent for them.]
•Dear girl worried you are his booty call: If his facebook doesn't list you as his girlfriend and you are hooking up with him, you're his booty call.
•@"You're wrong to have a long distance relationship" Sorry you're jealous that your long distance relationship didn't work out while other people's did. I've been in a wonderful long distance relationship for 4 years now. 4 more years to go while as my bf just started med school. And I have no doubt at all that we will make it.
•@"All the normal people who read these" First off, it's sad that you pride yourself on being "normal". Have fun with your average life. Secondly, actually eagle rants were created exactly for relationship issues and policy debates. Get a clue.
•That time where you think you might be pregnant during finals...EFF my life.
•@AU students graduate with the MOST DEBT IN DC.AU IS NOT DOING ENOUGH." You need to work on understanding correlation vs causation. AU could be giving out tons more financial aid than GW and Georgetown but if Georgetown and GW and filled with more upper class students who don't need financial aid whereas at AU there are more middle class students, then that puts more strain on AU.
•@ AU doesn't do enough: You are wrong. Props to AU for accepting a financially diverse student population, when they could easily just select the rich kids and no longer be called the number one highest debt college in DC.
•Women needs to quit trying to make the marginalized male population from conforming to their standards.
•@"My career as an undergrad will be ending in 9 days, and somehow I've made it out of college without writing a paper longer than 10 pages. #winning" You must be a business major.

•@Aspiring drag queen: Athena's on facebook, friend her!
•i didn't hate AU until they got new academic regulations. NOW I NEVER WANT TO RETURN FROM ABROAD OMG.
•This I feel like is a legitimate complaint, why doenst AU have a Fall/Spring Fest type weekend, or day, where we bring a cool musical act to campus, and have them perform on the quad? Plenty of other schools have this, and it seems awesome.
•I keep seeing rants that sound exactly like they could be my ex and getting mildly concerned....
•If you came from North/Upstate NY to DC, you have NO right to complain about the lack of snow. Did you not realize you were going SOUTH?
•dear x & y...good luck
•Dear boyfriend,
I love you very much, but it is time for you to do some "oh-my-gosh thanks for putting up with me" loving. I would like it to come in the form of home-made chocolate chip cookies.

•lol the poor kid wondering about the jogging date is probably more confused than ever...
•@AUConservative: I feel like that sometimes but I hail from liberal NJ so I'm used to it.
•I have major, major issues with my professor right now. Like built-up, long-term, legitimate resentment. I'm not an angry person, either.
•12 days of the holidays at the phonathon = LOTS OF BONUS BUCKS!!!
•Can we talk about the unobservant AU students at the intersection of New Mexico and Nebraska for a minute??? When the traffic across Nebraska stops, it DOES NOT automatically mean it's your turn to cross to and from SIS and the Nebraska Parking lot. If you didn't notice, there is now a garage at SIS and those people have right of way for about 10 seconds before your stupid people get to cross the street. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION. Walking when there isn't a walk sign doesn't make you an acclimated DCist; in this case, it makes you an idiot! Seriously!

Correction appended
Students will no longer be allowed to take General Education courses for pass/fail due to changes in the Undergraduate Academic Rules and Regulations. 
In addition, students will have to complete their General Education classes before finishing 60 credits at AU.
The changes will go into effect fall 2012, according to a campus-wide email sent by University Provost Scott Bass.
Students will only be allowed to take four courses at AU for a pass/fail grade. Courses with a mandatory pass/fail component aren’t part of that count. 
Previously, students could take 50 percent of their courses for pass/fail, as long as all major, minor and Honors courses were taken for a letter grade, according to the current course catalog. 
“The main concern is that no other school with which our graduates will be competing does this,” Professor Thaddeus Jackson told the Eagle in November 2010. “So one can graduate from American University with a transcript that looks somewhat suspicious because there’s lots of pass/fail on it.”
Latin honors and Dean’s List requirements were also increased:

Students will also no longer be able to opt out of College Writing by earning a 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement English Language and Composition exam or a 5 or higher on the Higher Level English International Baccalaureate Examination. 
Student who earn those scores will still have to take “College Writing, Intensive” or “Honors English, Intensive.”
A previous version of this story switched the new and old Dean's List numbers. The Eagle regrets the error.
