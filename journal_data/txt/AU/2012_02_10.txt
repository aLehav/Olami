• YOU ARE TEARING ME APART EAGLE RANTS EDITOR! Also, I love you.
[Editor’s Note: It’s tearin up my heart, when I’m with you, and when we are apart, I feel it too.]
• Dear girl in my class,
I'm sorry and pretty offended that you think that people believing in the Bible and Genesis are "crazy." I guess that makes you smarter than two billions of crazy people, almost a third of the inhabitants of this planet. If you ever feel like becoming tolerant, maybe I won't feel the need to rant about you anymore.
• We do have an AU Memes pages. People need to add images.posts to it!!
• People whining about rants need to stop. The Eagle Editor is unpaid, they just do it because they like it. Would you like it if half the rants were about how slow you post rants? I'm sure the editor has an important life wit other things to do.
• Someone made a tumblr of AU memes last year but hasn't updated it in a long time. There's a few good ones on there.
• @I call it “HOT HAM WATER!”
This soup is so watery! With a SMACK of HAM!
• @"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you." You didn't have to. Just come back.
• Everyone ranting about love, or someone you like, or having sex, etc: it better not be him, cause I still love him.
• To all the people who demand that the Eagle Rants be posted in the mornings: there is one Eagle Rants editor. Calm down and be considerate to a person who has a relatively difficult job.
• Thanks boo.
Love,
Riggie Harlot.
• I’ve looked into the eye of this island, and what I saw was beautiful.
• Hey you. Yes, you. You are beautiful, and I hope you have a nice day.
• @AU has a med school - excuse me what? get your facts straight.. I guess that means American University in Paris is also AU, right? uh, no..
• Sitting next to Rangos right now in RHA assembly!
• Is it bad that even though I have a boyfriend, all I want to do is have sex with other guys? Im simply not satisfied and require the extra meat!
• Things are so good at AU that half of the rants are about the timing of the rants?
• Hopelessly in love with a gay guy... Had to be at AU!
• so today i checked my mail and found out i got something from my high school. turns out they sent me a little "valentine's day" candygram package. it's defs gonna be all i'm getting for valentine's this year...LOLOL #singlesappreciationday
• Dear Editor,
    I write your pay checks.  While I do find the delay in posting Eagle Rants an effective strategy in keeping people waiting coming back to our web page...I personally would just like it if the rants posted automatically.  That way I can follow a conversation between two ranters in less than a week.  PS-- I still think you deserve a pay raise.
[Editor’s Note: Where are these paychecks going after you write them?]
• I like you....like, like you, like you. Sorry I'm so terrible at showing it
• To the boys that mooned me through the window in Leonard: Lets be friends.
From, the girl who mooned you back.
• Girls named Fiona are sexy. More importantly, they also have excellent personalities.
• If Nick Rangos wasn't the Preisdent of Anderson, I don't know what I'd do :(
• @ pick a side,
I'm sorry you feel this way. you're intimidating. just come ask me. I know that's easier said than done but please do it.
• Dear centennial 5 RA,
do you read eagle rants? is this the absolute worse way to find out?
xoxo
your secret admirer
• So much RHA drama :(
• @"'I know it’s horrible, but I really want to have sex with my best friend.' It's not horrible at all…. I want to too, but I don't think she's up for it :/" As the original poster, I am going to pretend you are the guy I wrote this about. I say we should both go for it.
• These LOST quotes are killing me. Can we start a LOST club on campus to quote and discuss and wear Dharma jumpsuits?
Sincerely,
One lonely LOST fan
• jeepers creepers, is it the new trend to be really angry about when the rants come out? I check them compulsively too, but I don't write OMG WHERE ARE MY RANTS every time they aren't there...
• My mother told me having me was a nightmare. I'm currently a law student at AU. I have gotten straight As my entire life. I'm involved in many clubs and community service programs. But now I have a drug habit because I always hear her insulting and condescending voice in my head each day. I wish I had some support. I wish my self esteem wasn't too low to make friends.
• "@Pepsi Girl ranter:  She's Jesse Eisenberg's sister, not Mark Zuckerberg's" And Jesse Eisenberg played Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network... It's a joke by the way. If we call her "pepsi girl" I can call her brother a name from role he played as well.  Also: maybe she doesn't want to be referred to as "pepsi girl" her entire life.
• So has anyone else had sex while their roommate was in the room?
• Dear cute blond delt guy, sorry I'm such a spazz, I can't help it, I'm crushing too hard.
• @"We use to talk but then you stopped. I can't help but feel like you used me..."If this is who I think it is, then I would advise that you get over him. Please spare yourself the pain and stop hooking up with him. Sorry but he will never actually be into you.
• To previous ranter about Photo Club: I don't think it's going on this year, but I'd love to start it up again!
• To the sober girls who hook up with drunk guys
There is something wrong with you.
• @Why no yellow fever?
Maybe they caught a case of the black plague instead :P
• If the dav workers are going to act so bitchy and pretentious they should at least be able to make my drink in under 45 minutes while they're are it.
• Dear Eagle Ranters,
The editor probably has class and work like the rest of us and doesn't have time to post rants every hour of the day!
• I hate that despite my help you are still well on the path to going getting kicked out of the university.
You're a leech and when I dare to let you fatten yourself off my blood so that you can survive, you just keep sucking.
• I know my roommate loves Star Wars like I do, but I hate my roommate. In order to keep Star Wars pure, I'm ditching you when I go to see Episode I with some friends.
Cheers!
• Late night library makeouts: let's make this happen.
• @ no Asian fever: Asian girls are amazing! Just when I see you, you're surrounded by 10 other girls and you are all speaking in a different language. Possibly intimidated much?
• There's gotta be some way to find hookups without partying, right? My  sex drive is way out of sync with my drive to party.
• Person who requested someone profess their love to them: I love you. I've always loved you ever since I laid mu eyes on you all those years ago. Our lives never connected but I yearned for them to be intertwined. You're a passionate, loving soul and I yearn for your heavenly embrace. Not a day goes by that I don't think of you my love.
Satisfied?
• I'm embarrassed.
• I think it's time to get divorced now, mister.
• @the person bashing gender neutral bathrooms. Gender neutral bathrooms make the trans* bathroom experience a billion times better because no one tells you that you're in the wrong place. quit being a closed minded fool.
• @person who wants someone to eat with for Valentines Day: I'm down.
• Keep in mind, some lesbians/bi girls don't go for butch girls. I'm into more femme chicks myself.
• Dear Single Rich AU Student,
I wouldn't mind going out with you. Not because you said your rich, but because you sound like a nice guy. Please don't prove me wrong and turn out to be a douche.
Sincerely,
Interested in You
• So... procrastination till 3 in the morning and then deciding to just turn it in late... Fail
• Come on, I don't want to be in the room while you swag swagswagswag bra bring-ding-ding your girlfriend!
• @”I know you're having a harder time than you're letting on…”
If this is directed at me, which feels pretty selfish to believe, then I’m sorry, I can’t. Worse things have happened to better people, have happened to me, but I don’t think I’m comfortable talking about this yet.
In case you’re thinking it’s because I don’t trust or depend on you, just know you’re pretty much the only one I’ve told. Like, at all. So don’t worry about that thing. I know that ‘by the time the bar closes, and I feel like falling down, you’ll carry me home’.
[Eagle Rants: This was exactly 100 words... Well played.]
• RIGGIE HARLOT
• It was great to see you again and avoid the awkwardness. Acting like an adult actually does have perks apparently.
• Hey guy in Kogod who can't take a hint, it took you a semester but I'm glad you finally understand I'M NOT INTERESTED.
• Dear god, why was there a protest/shouting match in the amphitheater at 7 AM this Friday?
• @ "She's Jesse Eisenberg's sister, not Mark Zuckerberg's." No duh.The person said it because Jesse was Mark in the Social Network.
• Zeta Psi's new pledge class has some hotties. me gusta
• Actually, high school and college degrees aren't necessary,  I mean sure, there's a social stigma against high school dropouts, and I can appreciate the whole "college experience" thing, but in the end, unless you are going into a field that requires higher education (law, medicine, education, etc) then it's not necessary.  Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you're taking a lot of extra steps
• I am the Eagle Rants editor!
[Editor’s Note: Impostor!]
• I also fail to see how spending what little money you have on a graduate degree will make you a better mother.  Having one baby is expensive, having six kids is really expensive.  You would rather spend $60,000+ on grad school for a degree that you won't even use in the professional world, when you could use that money for a house, diapers, groceries, a new van, or a family vacation.  Sounds pretty selfish to me.  Your kids won’t care if you have a masters degree.  They’ll just want you to be their mom.
• Guy in my Critical Whiteness class, why are you sooo damn cute?! I really want to talk to you but dont have the courage yet

Tony Wroblicky recorded a career-high 18 points and 17 rebounds along with four blocks in just 24 minutes of play to lead AU past Lehigh University 71-62 Feb. 9 at Bender Arena.
“Tonight, everything came together,” Wroblicky said. “I was scoring and I was able to rebound. I’ve gotten better offensively, and tonight was the culmination.”
With the Eagles’ (16-8, 7-2 PL) seventh conference win of the season, they move into sole possession of second place in the Patriot League while remaining undefeated at home 10-0.
The opening few minutes of the game saw back-and-forth action until the Mountain Hawks (18-7, 6-3 PL) went on a 13-0 run to build a 21-10 lead with 12:07 to go until halftime. 
AU called a timeout following the Lehigh run, and responded with an 11-2 run to cut the deficit to two.
“At various times, it didn’t really look like it was our night,” AU Head Coach Jeff Jones said. “But to give credit to our kids, they really bounced back and refused to give in.”
The two squads traded baskets over the next 10 minutes, and Lehigh led 34-31 with 3:01 left in the first half. But the Eagles closed the opening 20 minutes strong, going on a 9-2 run that gave them a 40-36 halftime advantage. 
Charles Hinkle’s 3-pointer capped AU’s spurt, as the senior scored 11 of his 15 points before halftime.
The Eagles kept a slim lead for almost all 20 minutes of the second half, never allowing the Mountain Hawks to take back the lead. Troy Brewer played a big role, scoring 11 points on 5-7 shooting from the field in the final 20 minutes.
He also defended C.J. McCollum, one of the nation’s top scorers, who poured in 30 points, but needed 29 shots to reach that total. McCollum ranks seventh in the country, averaging 21.7 points per game.
“C.J. is just one of those guys who is really good; he’s going to score,” Brewer said. “The thing you have to do is control the other players and do your best with him.”
That’s exactly what AU was able to do, as the Eagles only allowed one other Mountain Hawk (Jordan Hamilton, 11 points) to reach double figures while holding their other three starters below their season averages.
Simon McCormack also played well for the Eagles, recording five points while giving AU a spark off the bench. 
“He had a monster game in terms of effort and energy,” Jones said. “He got us going. There’s not a chance we win that game without Simon’s contributions.”
Now that the Eagles have taken control of the No. 2 spot in the conference, they’ll look to keep their momentum going in Worcester, Mass., when they take on Holy Cross Feb. 11.

The AU women's basketball team extended its winning streak to nine games after defeating Lehigh University 67-50 Feb. 8 in Bethlehem, Pa.
The game started out well for the Eagles (17-6, 9-0 PL), with baskets from Ebony Edwards and Alexis Dobbs to open the game. Dobbs made six 3-pointers on the night, as the sophomore guard totaled a career-high 21 points in the victory.
Jen Dumiak also had a strong performance, recording 18 points for AU. The freshman made an impact immediately, picking up one of her three steals on the night less than a minute after entering the game.
The Eagles went 25-60 (42 percent) from the floor and 9-22 (41 percent) from 3-point range for the contest. But their defense was the main reason for the victory, as they forced 26 Lehigh turnovers. 
"I thought our defense was key all night in pressuring Lehigh," AU Head Coach Matt Corkery told AU Athletics. "We found our range in the second half and knocked down some open looks. But it all starts with our effort on the defensive end of the floor, which was there for us tonight."
Alexa Williams scored a team-high 16 points for the Mountain Hawks (13-10, 6-3 PL), who dropped into a three-way tie for third place in the Patriot League with the loss.
With the game tied at 7-7 early on, the Eagles went on an 11-2 run to lead 18-9 with 8:02 to play in the first half. Dumiak scored eight of AU’s 11 points during the run, while Edwards accounted for the other three. 
Both offenses stalled after Dumiak’s 3-pointer at the 8:02 mark, and neither side scored a point for nearly three minutes.
Williams helped cut the deficit for Lehigh at the end of the first half, as the Mountain Hawks trailed 24-19 at halftime. 
The Eagles came out of the locker room on fire, starting the second half on an 11-2 run to take a 35-21 lead. With 9:52 remaining in the second half, Geleisa George’s jumper put the Eagles in front 52-27 for their largest lead of the game to that point.
AU continued to ride the offensive wave, opening up its lead to 27 points at 63-36 before coasting to the 67-50 win.
AU will next host Holy Cross Feb. 11 at Bender Arena, as the Eagles hope to improve to 10-0 in conference play and move one step closer to clinching the No. 1 seed in the Patriot League Tournament.

• Can we put the eagle rants tab on the right side the of the eagle website rather than the left. It's really annoying to have to expand the window each time when I want to click on eagle rants. Or at least make the format go "news", "scene", "eagle rants", "sports", "opinion", "incubator". Incubator isn't even really a part of the eagle. It shouldn't be before Eagle rants. I'm sure rants have 100 times the audience that incubator has.
• Why is it whenever I try to strike up a conversation with someone around campus (usually females) I basically get told to F off? Is it so hard to have a friendly chat, yes you're cute but that doesn't entitle you to have a ego the size of Jupiter.
• @How do you know you are in love--> yes everything the guy yesterday said, except for the fact that sometimes the significant other can be a lying, cheating, low-life sub-human that uses you for all your money and connections and leaves you feeling hopeless and broke. But best of luck to you!

• "Two sides: One is light, one is dark"
• @”If your goal in life is to be a stay at home mom, you don’t need a Master’s Degree.  You can get the same education by reading books in the field you want to study, classes at a community college, etc.” Actually you can’t take graduate level psychology classes at community college. Or any graduate classes for that matter.
• I know you're having a harder time than you're letting on.  I just wish I could take some of your unhappiness onto myself for a while, so that you could have a break.
• @”If your goal in life is to be a stay at home mom, you don’t need a Master’s Degree.  You can get the same education by reading books in the field you want to study, classes at a community college, etc.”  On that theory, a college degree isn’t necessary either. Or a high school degree. Neither is legally required. It’s not about being required.  I desire it, and it would make me more educated and better person overall. And a better mother.
• Dear Anderson 4 North,
A Just Dance Party?? Really??? Some people have class in the morning!!!
• @ MGC sex: been there, done that, several times. won't tell you where though, but it's highly recommended.
• @”I don’t think anyone is saying education is a waste of money or that mothers shouldn’t be educated.  But grad school does cost quite a bit of money” Money is not an issue. But even if it were, I would gladly spend my limited money on a graduate degree rather than a new car or a vacation, etc.
• I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you.
• @why go to grad school because you can take classes on itunes for free:  I take online classes online for free too.  But I’m guessing the ranter wants the self-validation and self-esteem that comes with actually earning a graduate degree. And like she said, if she ever did need to work someday, she would already have a graduate degree to fall back on (like an insurance policy).
• @”don’t they know we’re poor”. Actually many students are not poor. I for one, would love to add AU to my estate and give annual donations.
• @itunes over college: Then why go to college at all for undergrad? You can learn it all from library books? You don’t get it.  It’s not just about the classes. It’s about the graduate school experience. Meeting fellow intelligent people who share your interests.  Having challenging homework assignments. Getting grades and feedback from experts in the field. Etc.
• @fetish rants: I wanna have a threesome while my dog watches.
• @Gender Neutral Bathrooms.  I heard that all of the bathrooms in DC were gender neutral.  Establishments can still put up signs on bathrooms suggesting that they be for men or women, but they don't mean anything legally (whether or not this applies to the dorm bathrooms where people shower, I don't know)

• To the girl sitting next to me in the library on the 2nd floor: you're really pretty and I wish I had the courage to talk to you...

The years will continue to fly by, and I'll continue to wonder what could we have been, if anything at all? Keep being awesome.
-probably in the friend zone, and that's fine by me.
• I REALLY wish it was socially acceptable to not wear pants in class
• @hard to convince yourself: I felt the same way my entire Freshman year, and it didn't help that 2 good friends ended up transferring. Just keep stay positive, don't let the negativity bring you down, and remember: the most vocal are the ones with the strongest opinion. There are still a lot of people here who really like this school, but don't go around complaining / talking about it all the time. JUST KEEP SWIMMING :)
• What is with all the hate on girls who mix business dress with sexy dress, as being in the 1% of AU (being a straight man) I find it liberating and empowering. (Psst... Not really, but maybe a lib will eat it up... like comm major lib.)
• kinda wish the GLBTA office had another A... A for Aesexual.
• The computers in the Anderson Lab are so slow, it took me 10 minutes to get to my email. I think I actually felt myself aging because of the slow speed of those damn machines.
• Folks, stop ribbing on the Eagle Rants Editor for the time of day that the rants get posted. Keep in mind that these were only posted once a week just 3 months ago. She probably has classes and homework and a social life to keep up with too. Lay off.
[Editor’s Note: Preach!]
• I hate seeing you around on campus knowing what you did to me freshman year. I hate that everyone thinks you are so shy and nice. But I've never hated you.
• Rants on rants on rants
• Anyone else wish AU had a men's studies minor? Oh wait, they do and it's called "History"
• I am in love with a girl on the diving team...And she doesn't even know I exist... (Charlie Brown Problem)
• I'm a single, rich AU student.  Would any girl like to go out for valentines day?  Anywhere you want to go!  Just somebody eat with me. :(
• I love you so much it scares me.
• I think we should have an AU professor appreciation day. My profs at AU have all been amazing. Both the full time and the adjuncts. I never knew learning could be so fun before I came to AU.
• @GW girl dating AU: Stop stealing our straight guys! We don't have many of them. They are a precious commodity.
• Why does everyone complain about TDR? It's good food, but if you don't think so, theres at least all you want to eat.
• PLEASE STOP SLAMMING THE DOORS!!! loud rude ughhhh just stop! it takes 5 seconds to shut it quietly. stop!!!! end rant.
• @Pepsi Girl ranter:  She's Jesse Eisenberg's sister, not Mark Zuckerberg's.
• Dear Senior Who Hits On Me In Class--
You're nice and all, but you're not my type.  Besides, I already have a boyfriend.  So if you could just tone it down a little, I'd appreciate it.  I think you're cool and want to be friends with you, but nothing more than that.
Thanks,
Freshman You Hit On
• To every member of WVAU,
Learn how to use "reply" instead of "reply all."
Sincerely,
I don't care what you have to say.
• To the guy in my group, your intensity makes me scared of you but at the same time am so attracted to you.
Your peer admirer
• We use to talk but then you stopped. I can't help but feel like you used me. But at the same time I would really like to talk to you again because I still  think your interesting. Im setting myself up to get hurt again
• New Rule : Eagle Rants must be posted by noon each day. No exceptions.
[Editor’s Note: You know, or not.] 
• You are literally my dream girl. Why do you have to be my roommate?
• I used to really like you but now I think you're a total douche
• If you like me, you do a really bad job of showing it. If you don't like me, you do a really bad job of showing it. Pick a side!
• Hey editor,
How do you like your wine?
;)
[Editor’s Note: This is a dry campus.]
• I wish someone professed their love to me through a rant :)
• @person who wants AU to open a medical school. As someone who is pre-med, I don't recommend this. Although a DO program would be great, it doesn't fit the school and honestly we seriously do not need something else to be second (or third) at compared to the other schools in DC. Let's just stick with what we have. I will go to medical school somewhere else.
• if you go online and look @ the library of congress it says that you can have a MAX of 1,200 people at an event.. why did SG only give out 500 tickets?
• Kevin Sutherland saves the Jobs Board huzzah!!!
• Just because my parents pay for my education doesn't mean I don't work as hard as kids that are footing the bill themselves. I'm on Dean's list, have a part time job, am involved in multiple organizations on campus, and have an internship. I'm truly grateful for my parents' help, not some trust fund baby that sits on my ass all day.
• I am sick. I have work to do. And I want it all to go away :(
• "You're born, you live and you die. There are no do-overs, no second chances to make things right if you frak 'em up the first time. Not in this life anyway. Like I said, you make your choices and you live with them. And in end you are those choices." --Kendra Shaw
• @hot new senators, why would I ever tell you who I was. You're still hot though. I will be at senate though. See you then!
• washington college of lulz
• To the person who left a hot pink Post-it in the Women's bathroom mirror in Ward which said  "you're beautiful": Thanks, it was a nice pick-me-up to the afternoon. Please keep them coming!
• Phonathon sucks lol
• This is ridiculous. Can you just let the rant accumulate all day and night and then post them in the mornings?
[Editor’s Note: Just read the previous days rants in the morning?]
• I love going to this university, even with the awful WONK campaign, but I swear to God if we get one of those meme pages every university seems to be doing this week, s**ts will be flipped.
• The Dav is high on attitude and low on coffee.
• @eaglerantseditor.
lets make babies.
• EAGLE EDITOR, Y U NO PUT EAGLE RANTS UP QUICKER?!?

Riggie Harlot.
