Executive board members of Students to End Abortion Stigma, Maddie Pavek, Cerys Beck, Laura Gerson, Fran Smock and Stephanie Black (not pictured are Emily Wolfe, Annabel Collinson and Jasmine Bevel).
Students to End Abortion Stigma (S2EAS), a new organization on campus founded in fall 2016, provides a space to discuss women’s reproductive rights. 
School of International Service junior Becca Thimmesch organized the group. 
“I originally got the idea for S2EAS while interning at a large abortion rights nonprofit,” Thimmesch said. “I had grown very frustrated with a general slowness to make abortion rights more intersectional.”
The group is “committed to fostering open and frank discussions about abortion and contraception on college campuses,” according to its mission statement.
“I knew I wanted to do something on campus, but I was hesitant at the idea of chaptering one of the big-name groups whose messaging didn't fit AU's campus,” Thimmesch said. “What we wanted was an entirely youth-led group where inclusion and intersectionality were the default, not something that constantly needed reminding.”
The group is not officially an organization on campus yet, however they are still meeting while they await approval from the Office of Campus Life.  
After the presidential election, S2EAS hosted an event in November called “Where Do We Go From Here: Reproductive Rights under Trump.” This discussion took place as a way for students to learn about how they can keep fighting for reproductive rights and women’s justice with President Donald Trump in office. 
The event “was a response to two of the largest concerns I was getting after the election. The first was about access and the second was mass confusion about the future of abortion access,” Thimmesch said. 
S2EAS is planning on partnering with the Public Health Association for Public Health Week, April 3-9, to host a screening of the film “Trapped,” a 2016 PBS documentary by Dawn Porter that takes a look at the legislation passed in the last year to prohibit women’s abortion rights. 
The groups plan to accompany the film with a panel discussion with members from National Abortion Rights Action League and Planned Parenthood. 
The organization is currently looking for a programming executive board member to plan more events for the future. 
Steph Black, a sophomore in the School of Communication, is the director of communications for S2EAS. She works with the group out of personal interest to further the group’s message.
“We want to be able to create a space on campus for people who are talking about these issues, thinking about these issues or even people who have had abortions or have had these kinds of life experiences,” Black said. 
Black said the members are “more than receptive” to helping anyone who needs help or wants to discuss any of the issues surrounding women’s reproductive rights. 
The group is a strong advocate for reproductive health. She added that members of the organization have made posts about getting IUDs, talked people through the procedure and have even gone to the clinics with individuals seeking the contraceptive implant. 
Additionally, they want to be the group on campus for anyone that needs a support system, Black said. 
“I think that we live in a really crazy time right now and in a very tumultuous climate but there are people on this campus who do care about abortion and who do care about people who need abortion,” Black said. “We’re here for people and we hope that we can help in any way necessary.”

Students protested an anticipated tuition increase ahead of the Board of Trustees meeting in March 2017. 
Education Not Debt, a student group concerned with the rise of tuition costs at AU, organized a small protest of approximately 30 people outside of the Butler Board Room on March 3 at the start of the University budget meeting. 
The Board of Trustees later voted to implement a tuition hike of 4 percent, which will be implemented in both the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school years. 
END member Amelia Covington, a sophomore, said that tuition hikes are a main concern for the club, and that it is important for students to be aware of the budget process.
“There’s this constant fight to keep tuition high, and while I understand that this is a very tuition-based university, at the same time, the University claims to be really diverse and inclusive, but you can’t really be economically inclusive if you just keep jacking up the price more and more,” Covington said. 
Before the board passed the budget for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 last week, the group focused on tabling across campus and invited students to write letters to President Neil Kerwin in protest of the tuition increase. 
Covington said the group decided to write letters to Kerwin specifically because he would be one of the last people to approve the budget. The group hoped the letters would appeal to him in the final months of his presidency, Covington said. They delivered the letters on Wednesday, March 1, where they spoke in front of a staff member expressing their concerns about rising tuition.  
Kerwin has not responded to these student letters as of March 8, which Covington estimated to be around 60 total at the end of their tabling.
END member Aijah Raghnal, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, decided to get involved in the club after her friend from her hometown was forced to switch schools because of the rising costs of AU and her inability to receive more financial aid. 
“Students shouldn't have their education or experienced marred by whether or not they'll spend the next ten years in debt,” Raghnal said. She expressed concerns that the University is acting more like a “business” and said she wants to help fight back against education as a “debt sentence.” 
Covington said they organized the letter writing campaign because the University didn’t organize a community town hall to specifically discuss the tuition hike specifically. She said that overall financial transparency about the budget and the Board of Trustees is necessary for more students to be able to understand why tuition gets raised every two years. 
Prior to the passing of the budget, student government leaders hosted a community town hall with members of the budget committee in February.
Covington also noted that a survey conducted by the Chronicle of Higher Education in 2011 found that Kerwin was the highest paid university president in the Washington area, earning $1.3 million in salary, benefits, paid compensation and other pay that year.

Former Sen. Russ Feingold and SIS Dean James Goldgeier in an interview entitled “The Undermining of the Legitimacy of the American Government" on March 1. 
Students and faculty came together in the Abramson Family Founders Room where SIS Dean James Goldgeier welcomed special guest, former Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, as part of the Dean’s Discussion series on March 1. Each semester, Dean Goldgeier invites an expert to campus so they can have a one-on-one interview discussing critical topics relating to international affairs. 
Senator Feingold was a Democratic senator for 18 years. He is most well known for having a strong code of ethics and for being vocal on sensitive issues, at times when other senators were working in opposition to his views. He was the only senator who voted against the PATRIOT Act when it was first proposed in 2001. 
Feingold recently joined the AU community as a distinguished executive in residence. In this role he will teach a series of spring courses in a SIS skills institute, which is meant to introduce students more to the professional world of international service. His course is titled “Diplomatic Challenges and Skills: Case Study—Great Lakes Region of Africa,” and it regards conflicts that occurred throughout the past two decades within the African Great Lake Region, as well as Feingold's own unique perspective regarding American International Affairs with the region. 
The title of the Dean’s discussion was “The Undermining of the Legitimacy of the American Government.” The format of the talk included a 30-minute interview between Goldgeier and Feingold, followed by a half-hour of open questions from the students to Feingold.
Goldgeier began the interview by asking Feingold about what he had tried to do for Wisconsin in his almost two decades as its representative. 
“I've made a career as a senator going to all 72 counties in the state every year and having a town meeting,” Feingold said. “I want to talk to everyone, whether the county has just 4,000 people, or many times more.” 
Following this, Goldgeier asked Feingold what he foresees political campaigns will look like in the future and what problems he has seen arise after the most recent election season, regarding flaws in the voting system itself, and flaws regarding the legality of certain campaigning measured.
The senator said there are four main areas of campaigning that need huge reform: the right to vote, campaign finance, the electoral college and the U.S. Supreme Court. 
“An institution of massive concern is the electoral college,” he said, “Two out of the last three presidents didn't win nearly enough votes to get elected but they kept the position anyways.”
After discussing the parts of campaigns that were troubling to him, the senator and the dean talked about the recent presidential election.
“Trump is a big problem,” Feingold said. “The attack of his on the media is really disturbing. We have to protect these institutions. When the president of the United States says the press, the media, is the enemy of people, we have to draw the line.”
Following the interview, many students lined up to ask questions. One question came from Alex de Ramon, a freshman in SIS, who asked Feingold about the path the Democrats should take in the 2018 and 2020 election.
“The hardcore direct talk of Trump appealed to some people,” Feingold said. “I just don't how some people could vote for him after some of the stuff that he has said. Going forward, I think that it would be a huge mistake for the Democrats to try to be a middle party. We need to make a strong message about our democracy.”

Patagonia arrived on AU’s campus March 1, armed with sewing machines and one mission: “If it’s broke, fix it!”
The outdoor clothing company visited AU to help students fix worn clothing as part of their Worn Wear College Tour.Patagoniais stoppingat universitiesandcolleges acrossthecountryto promote sustainable clothinguseof all brands.
The center of operations for the tour lies inside a redesigned 1993 Dodge Cummins D250. A wood plaque on the side of the truck reveals all the details of it. It has an added wooden shell made from salvaged redwood wine barrels. The plaque also says that the truck, which even has a fold-down bed, is officially known as “The Worn Wear Rig” but has been dubbed “Delia”. 
For the tour, Patagonia is working in conjunction with Post-Landfill Action Network, (PLAN) a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting zero waste practices on college campuses.
“[PLAN] was responsible for coordinating the details of the tour from creating permits for schools to booking the spaces and setting up logistics,” director and founder Alex Freid said.
PLAN partnered with AU to create the student clubs Zero Waste AU and AU Student Zero Waste Club,whichareboth responsible for the separate recycling, compost and landfill bins seen throughout campus. PLAN has helped form similar clubs at over 100 campuses, according to its website. 
Freid was on campus for the event assisting students and helping the staff fix clothes, and spoke positively about AU’s zero waste initiatives. 
“American is one of our exemplary campuses having really amazing models and well developed programs. Being chosen for the Worn Wear tour is an honor for your leadership in zero waste.” 
He emphasized the importance of teaching students how to fix and reuse clothes as an alternative to buying new clothes. In addition to fixing clothes, the tour also featured lightly used clothes for sale. Separate from those clothes for sale outside, there was a pop-up thrift sale of lightly used clothes going on in the Mary Graydon Center in conjunction with the tour run by the AU Student Zero Waste Club.
The event drew lots of curious AU students to check out what was going on, including juniors Dillan Archevesky and Greg Lomat. 
“While I’m not here explicitly to support Patagonia, events like this definitely impact things I would choose to buy in the future,” Archevesky said. “It also changes my minds on certain brands and consumerism.” Lomat also said that he tries to choose more sustainable brands when possible.
In addition to the clothing repairs, organizers screened the documentary “Before the Flood.” The film, produced by Leonardo Dicaprio in collaboration with others, features Dicaprio traveling across the world learning about the consequences of climate change and the issue of climate change denial. 
The next stop on Patagonia’s tour is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on March 10. It will make many more stops before completing the tour at UC Santa Barbara on April 26.

Ambassador Susan Elizabeth Rice is now a member of AU faculty as a Distinguished Visiting Research Fellow, the University announced on March 8. She will serve as a mentor in the School of International Service on careers in national security. Rice will also spend time writing a new book while at AU. 
Rice spent four years as an ambassador to the United Nations before she joined President Obama’s administration as the National Security Advisor in 2013. Her role was to provide the president with all of the foreign and national security policy, intelligence and military affairs. 
“I am very pleased to become a part of SIS and the AU family,” Rice said in the announcement. “I look forward to joining this distinguished community.”
School of International Service dean James Goldgeier said he welcomes ambassador Rice to the AU community. 
“We are looking forward to students interacting with her and to gain insights from her about pursuing careers in national security,” Goldgeier said. 
Goldgeier said students will have the opportunity to work with Rice on research for their studies, specifically work focused on national security matters.

CNN news anchor and Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley moderates the “Women on the Run” panel with Jennifer Lawless and Danny Hayes on March 6.
CNN news anchor and Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley moderated a panel titled “Women on the Run” on March 6 to question misconceptions about women in politics. 
The panel featured co-authors Jennifer Lawless and Danny Hayes, who wrote “Women on the Run: Gender, Media, and Political Campaigns in a Polarized Era” last May. The Kennedy Political Union teamed up with the AU Women and Politics Institute to host the event.  
Lawless, the director of AU’s Women and Politics Institute and a School of Public Affairs professor, worked with Hayes, a political science professor at George Washington University, to write the book. Their work focuses on debunking common myths about women in politics. 
The two noted that women are widely thought to experience less success in politics than their male counterparts. However, Lawless pointed out this is not actually the case.
“There is nothing to suggest that when women run for office they don’t win at equal rates,” Lawless said.“There is nothing to suggest that donors don’t give the same amounts to male and female candidates. And the media generally treat male and female candidates the same way, at least when they run for Congress, in terms of the volume of coverage they receive and what that coverage looks like.”
In doing research for the book, Lawless and Hayes found gender was not relevant when voters go to the polls. More times than not, voters follow party lines and choose candidates based on beliefs. 
“Our argument in the book is by no means to say women do not face sexism, either on the floor of the Senate or in other ways in politics, in ways that men don’t have to put up with,” Hayes said. “The question then becomes, ‘Does that translate into electoral bias against them in ways conventional wisdom assumes?’”
Crowley asked the authors to explain how the United States is ranked 104th in the world for female representation in political assemblies. Lawless attributed this to the entrepreneurial nature of U.S. elections. There is a certain infrastructure necessary to run for office, she said. 
“Women haven’t found themselves in the networks and with the kinds of connections the facilitate that kind of access,” Lawless said. 
Despite not having these resources, women still manage to perform equally as well as men. Even with all of the evidence in the book, Crowley had a hard time believing this was the case. 
“There is something deep inside me that says ‘this isn’t true,’” Crowley said during the event. 
In her experience covering elections at the federal level, Crowley found sexism to be extremely prevalent.
“I remember in 2008 we went to our first town hall meeting in Iowa, after Hillary Clinton announced she was running, and one of the first questions out of the bag was, ‘Are you tough enough to take on Saddam Hussein?’” Crowley said. “So I feel like there are nuances in language and nuances in what voters are asking, that to me did speak to a difference.” 
The authors are not suggesting women do not face sexism in politics. However, when it comes to elections, there is nothing to prove they do not do as well as male candidates, Lawless said.
“We would agree that the 2016 election cycle certainly at the presidential level was rifled with sexism and discussions of gender in ways which I thought we were beyond,” Lawless said. 
Lawless and Hayes said they are optimistic for the future. The two think that in order to see more women in office, they need encouragement. 
“In some ways I think the future for women in American politics is quite bright,” Hayes said. “One of the consequences of the election was that there seems to have been a lot of expression of interest in politics from women.”
