• Action stations! Action stations! Set condition 1 throughout the ship.
• Can we have a mobile optimized version of the eagle web site? Thx.
• Nothing is absolute. All in all, American is my alma mater and when I reminisce on my time there I wish desperately to be back. If you are truly unhappy either change you or your surroundings. I am proud that I was able to meet intelligent, open-minded people. God Bless American ( I made a funny!)
• I'd rather sit in my sweats and be a fatty whilst watching Disney and order in than get drunk and partay. I am OK with that finally.
• Can’t wait to get back to AU. So many other gingers there. Where my gingers at?!?!
• Dear Gathering,
I'm a Christian. I hate you.
No love,
Learnt to practice what you preach.
• Dear Gathering,
I'm not an atheist, and I still couldn't care less when your meetings are.
Signed,

• The performance of Eagle Rants this summer has been particularly underwhelming compared to projections. I'm downgrading it to AA+.
• I MISS WVAU.
• What is the Soho coffee house?
• Dear Mr. Cheetos and World of Warcraft,
If you think rants are so pathetic, then why are you always ranting?
#getalife
• What's so pathetic about being single and wanting a relationship? Millions of college students across the world are going through the same thing. Why not commiserate together? Stop the hating.
• I start med school next week and I'm SOOO scared.
• Extremely excited to go to AU this fall, I hope I won't be let down!
• AU may have slipped to number 5 most politically active according to The Princeton Review, but what they don't realize is that Georgetown and GW smell. So there. 
• Dear Eagle Rants,
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for existing in the summer. If it weren't for you, my summer would have been terrible. You gave me something to look forward to each week.
Thanks.
• Two words for you … OW-NED!
• Reading my own rants justifies my existence. It's my only reason for living. If I don't read this, consider me dead.
• All of this has happened before, and all of it will happen again …
-Battlestar Galactica
• F@#$, I mean, if you can't get a date in college … what's gonna happen when you graduate????
• Apparently the ginger kid in the SG video is dating someone. Call me Jealous Wonk!
• I could have gone to AU for another year, but reading these rants made me glad I graduated. Sorry, folks.
• Gathering,
If you want to appear less like a cult, don’t play on a seesaw for an entire day. It’s just weird …
Also don’t pray in dorm lounges; it’s weird to walk in there in my boxers and see people praying. (Probably weird for you too …)
• White sheets were a mistake …
• $37 a day to move in early?!?! YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS!!!!!
• I am so completely unexcited to come back to D.C. Please switch to California weather, ‘kay thanks.
• Release your burden.

Two American University students had a unique opportunity to intern at the White House this summer. 
Greg Saperstein, a rising senior in the School of Communication, worked in the Office of Presidential Correspondence, responding to mail sent to the White House. 
“Every day there is something new and it is a fast-paced office,” Saperstein wrote in an email. 
Nile Johnson, who just completed her masters in SIS, is an intern in the Office of Scheduling and Advance, which coordinates the itineraries for the President and the White House Press Corps. The office also handles logistics regarding those events. 
“Given the challenges currently facing our nation, it is a humbling experience to be here,” Johnson said in an email. “The 110 percent that each of my colleagues gives every day is nothing short of extraordinary.” 
Both students said they have a passion for public service, making their current experience all the more valuable. 
“The value I place on being a public servant combined with this current administration’s inclusiveness of young Americans in every facet of the White House contributed to my desire to serve as a White House intern,” Johnson wrote. 
White House interns are given the opportunity to participate in many different community service projects throughout D.C. At the White House Internship Program Speaker Series, Johnson introduced Special Assistant to the President and Personal Aide to the President, Reggie Love. Saperstein got to meet Vice President Joe Biden and First Lady Michelle Obama.
Johnson will begin a career in the Foreign Service upon the conclusion of her internship, and Saperstein will start an internship at a marketing firm in Arlington, Va.
Though neither intern was paid, they were both thrilled to have the opportunity to work in a professional environment among coworkers who were passionate about what they were doing.
“Working at the White House is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I am glad to be a part of it,” Saperstein wrote. 
Ten American University students have done internships for credit at the White House in the past three years, according to AU Career Center Director of Experiential Education Francine Blume.
