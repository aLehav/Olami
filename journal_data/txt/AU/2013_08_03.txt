The White House honored Ki’tay Davidson, a rising senior in the School of Public Affairs, on July 25 as a “Champion of Change” for his work as a disability rights activist. 
Davidson was one of eight young Americans that Associate Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement Cecilia Gordon deemed to “embody the spirit of the Americans with Disabilities Act.” 
The event marks the twenty-third anniversary of President George H.W. Bush signing the ADA into law on July 26, 1990. The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability.
He advocated to make AU’s campus friendlier to students with disabilities through his work as the director of ableism awareness and community outreach on the AU Disability Rights Coalition, The Eagle previously reported. He is currently an intern for Disability Rights International.
