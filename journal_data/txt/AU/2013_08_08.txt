Lupe Fiasco will perform at AU on Aug. 24 with special guest Travis Porter, kicking off this year’s Student Union Board set of artists.  
The show will start at 9 p.m. in Bender Arena with doors opening an hour earlier. Admission is free for AU students with a valid AU ID.
“We’re making some really great changes this year and this show is just the beginning of a new and improved SUB,” said SUB Director Noah Gray. “It will be a great show and awesome time regardless if you’re an incoming freshman or if it’s your fourth year here like me.”
This show will be the first big Welcome Week show since 2010, in which hip-hop artist B.o.B. performed in the Tavern, according to the press release.
