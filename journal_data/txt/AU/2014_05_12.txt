Danielle Green’s column explores the stories behind AU students’ tattoos. Read her introductory column for her thoughts on tattoos in general.
Mark Bevilacqua decided to finally get his first tattoo once he was out from underneath his parents’ roof. He finally finished his quarter-sleeve tattoo this past August almost 15 hours of tattooing work. His colorful tattoo displays a forest scene with a pale yellow flower as the center piece. 
“I wanted to get something that I’d never regret,” he said. 
Bevilacqua, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences and native to Long Island, New York came to American University to study Spanish Language. He was driven by his future plans to work for his family’s construction business where many of the workers speak Spanish. His decision to get the tattoo came after two years of contemplation. 
His tattoo features a scene from the 1987 animated film, “The Brave Little Toaster”. 
“I grew up with this film. It really had an impact on my childhood. At the time I didn’t think much of it, I just enjoyed it. It was only later that I found out how dark the film really is,” Bevilacqua said. 
The film follows a group of appliances as they travel to find their owner who they believe has left them behind. The main character, the Toaster, leads the group on this adventure. 
On a break during the journey, the Toaster wanders off into the forest. There he finds a single yellow flower who flirts wordlessly with the Toaster. The Toaster rejects the flower, claiming that he isn’t a flower and promptly runs away. He looks back at the flower and sees that it is now dying from the pain of rejection. The short encounter between the Toaster and the flower is never brought up again. 
“To me this scene is a story of rejection and the tattoo stands as a symbol of reclaiming your worth. For me, getting a tattoo was a way to take back control of my life and living life the way that I want,” said Bevilacqua.

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority and the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority reached an agreement April 24 that put the Silver Line on track to begin limited service sometime this summer. 
The Silver Line is the first major extension added to the track in 38 years and will provide service to Northern Virginia, according to a Washington Post report. Phase Two construction, which includes a Dulles International Airport station, is already underway and is projected to be completed by 2018, according to a WMATA service plan. 
MWAA, the company overseeing construction, officially handed over the project to WMATA but will still be allowed to finish up certain construction projects, such as installing track circuits and completing track work, according to a WMATA press release. WMATA will take full control of the Silver Line once main construction ends. 
The agreement should speed up the $5.6 billion project, which is already $150 million over-budget and seven months behind the original December 2013 opening date, according to the Washington Post. If construction finishes on schedule, WMATA could take control of the project as early as May, allowing for an additional 90 days of testing, employee training and emergency drills, the WMATA press release explained.

Three ambassadors representing the African Union Mission in the United States, Tanzania and Mozambique spoke to AU students and staff about contemporary issues facing Africa, including the importance of global partnerships, entrepreneurship and education on April 16 in the School of International Service Founders Room. 
The event was hosted by the student group Africa Initiative, who focused the discussion under the theme “Moving Africa Forward.” The three ambassadors, all of whom were women, spoke about barriers their countries must overcome to take a larger role in the modern global economy and international politics. 
The three ambassadors, Her Excellency Amina Salum Ali of the African Union, Liberata Mulamula of the United Republic of Tanzania and Amelia Matos Sumbana of the Republic of Mozambique, each focused on one of the topics, globalization, entrepreneurship and education, during their portion of the panel.
Ali talked about the new wave of growth and development sweeping across the continent during her discussion of global partnerships. She said that in such an environment, African countries, specifically the 54 nations that are members of the African Union, need to “realize [their] potential.”
The African voice needs to be heard on a more global scale, and to do so countries must continue to work to cooperate with one another, according to Ali. 
“We have to integrate, we have to join hands in our development,” Ali said. “In order for the african voice, we need partners to work with us.”
During the second portion of the panel, Mulamula spoke about the importance of empowering young entrepreneurs throughout Africa to create their own opportunities through small businesses. 
“You can start small, but you can grow big,” she said. 
Sumbana was the last speaker of the panel and rounded out the event’s discussion of how to move African countries forward in the global community. She addressed the current state of education in Mozambique. She also encouraged students to remember that Africa is more than one block of states and people but that it is comprised of individual countries each with a unique culture. 
“People are starting to learn that each of the 53 countries are different,” Sumbana said. “We are all Africans, but we are all different.”
