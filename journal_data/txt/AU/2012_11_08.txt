President Barack Obama won re-election in the 2012 presidential campaign against Gov. Mitt Romney on Tuesday after garnering the electoral votes of several major swing states. The president received noteworthy support from college age students as 60 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 cast their ballots for Obama. 
In addition, more young people voted in this election than in 2008.  People between the ages of 18 and 29 accounted for 19 percent of those who voted in the election, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research.
Battleground States
Obama won 11 of the 14 swing states, including Virginia, Ohio, Colorado, Iowa and Nevada.
Both the Obama and Romney campaigns expect Florida to narrowly favor the president.
Same-Sex Marriage
Maryland and Maine passed ballot measures Tuesday allowing same-sex marriage. Washington state is projected to pass a similar ballot measure, but results had not been finalized as of Nov. 8. Minnesota voters also rejected a measure that would have banned same-sex marriage. 
Marijuana Initiatives 
Recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado and Washington state, and medical marijuana may be legalized in Massachusetts and Montana, pending final vote counts.  However, Oregon and Arkansas voted against legalization of marijuana. 
Puerto Rico may become the 51st State of America
Puerto Ricans voted in favor of statehood for the first time. According to the Constitution, Congress would still need to decide whether or not to accept Puerto Rico as a state before it can join the union.
Warren Unseats Brown 
Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren defeated Republican Senator Scott Brown in the Senate race.  The Warren-Brown race gained publicity after Brown’s repeated accusations that Warren illegitimately claimed to have Native American ancestry to advance her career. Brown was elected to replace the deceased Sen. Ted Kennedy, a longtime Democrat in the Senate. Warren helped create the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, a major cornerstone for the Obama Administration, and was a favorite among Democrats to head the new agency. 
Mourdock Defeated by Donnelly
The Democrats gained another seat in the Senate with the victory of Joe Donnelly over Republican Richard Mourdock.  Mourdock was severely criticized after he said that pregnancy as a result of rape was “something God intended.”
McCaskill Defeats Akin
Claire McCaskill defeated Todd Akin in the Missouri Senate Race.  Akin’s campaign had its share of controversy. When he was asked whether abortion should be allowed in the case of rape, and he responded that “the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down.”  He went on to say that the rapist, not the unborn child, should be punished.

Members of the Coalition of American University Students (CAUS) marched to President Neil Kerwin's home on Glenbrook Road Nov. 8 to demand a tuition freeze, leading to the dispatch of two AU Public Safety cars and a Metropolitan Police Department car.
"You are in violation of the law," said an AU Public Safety officer over his car's loudspeaker as the students approached Kerwin's home. D.C. currently forbids “unreasonably loud noise” after 10 p.m. Nobody was arrested.
Over 40 CAUS members arrived at the home just before 11:30 p.m., banging on pots and pans and shouting protest chants, such as "hey hey, ho ho, tuition hike has got to go" and "beat back the tuition attack.”

"You're hurting yourselves," said Kerwin, who left his home to address the students.
Kerwin criticized CAUS's method of protesting, particularly the noise level in a residential neighborhood late at night.
"It's not the way it's [a tuition freeze] gonna get done," Kerwin said.
"Who are you accountable to?" CAUS member Mana Aliabadi, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, asked Kerwin.
"The [AU] Board of Trustees," he said.
Several CAUS members chanted the name of investment banking firm Goldman Sachs in reaction.
AU Board of Trustees Finance and Investment Committee Chairman Gary Cohn is the president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs.
“One would expect the president to be accountable to the students,” said CAUS member Valerie Kiebala, a sophomore in the School of International Service, in a phone interview with The Eagle after the protest. “We’re really surprised by Kerwin’s lack of respect for us.”
Kiebala said that CAUS members will expand their focus and plan to approach trustees and other members of the AU administration to discuss a tuition freeze.

Students and D.C.-area residents swarmed the White House as media declared President Barack Obama the winner of the 2012 presidential election Nov. 7. As temperatures dipped in the early morning, the crowd swelled with Obama supporters.
Of the 19 percent of the voters who were under the age of 30, 60 percent of them voted for Obama, according to exit polls by Edison Research.
Hundreds of people celebrated an early victory outside the White House on Election Night, bundled in winter garb. College students from AU and other D.C. schools chanted “Four more years!” from trees while others waved flags and posters celebrating Obama’s win over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. 
Cigarette and marijuana smoke wafted above the heads of those who had gathered in front of the White House at Lafayette Park. Champagne was popped as the street became increasingly filled with broken glass and crumpled beer cans. At least three life-size cardboard cutouts of Obama bobbed through the crowd.
AU students gathered at the White House, many after attending various on-campus viewing parties, to experience the one presidential election to take place during their time at AU.
• “I’m a little overwhelmed. I can’t believe I’m taking part in history right now and that I’m standing right in front of it, but this is awesome and I’m really happy that I got to vote. We’re moving forward!” - Emilie Litsas, SIS freshman
• “I think we are going to party. It’s just a good night to be here.” - Tyler Sadonis, SPA junior
• “You should go to the White House to experience this. Otherwise, you’re not taking advantage of the experience that you have,” - Monica Charles, SOC sophomore
• “It’s my last year at AU. I couldn’t imagine being anywhere for this. And this is the place to be.” - Danny Baldwin, CAS senior
• “People are coming back together for their country.” - Francesca Cameron, SIS sophomore
• “I was screaming, so many people were screaming, I just couldn’t help it.” - Claire Woosley, CAS freshman
• “We just want to revel in all this awesome energy, just bask in it right now.” - Manal Lafralta, D.C. resident working in international development
• “I think the thing that is particularly tremendous about the crowd that here right now, is the fact that almost everyone here is young… And I think what it shows is that the priorities of the future leaders of this country are in a place that really supports equality for all people, and that is working towards trying to come up with a country that will ultimately be sustainable for future generation. I think it shows we have confidence Obama can bring that for us.” - Jeff Nadel, Colorado College ’12 graduate
• “I think it’s just that Obama was really the right choice for the next four years. I think we would be really regressing with Romney.” - Adam Beckerman, SPA junior
• “We were on campus, and everyone was cheering, and we were like, ‘we really need to be at the White House right now.’” - Paige Salmon, SOC sophomore
• “I don’t even support President Obama. I didn’t support him in the elections, but I just wanted to be a part of this. I mean I’m only going to be here for a few years, and I wanted to take part in the celebration and know what it’s like when we get someone from our ideological beliefs in the White House. Be prepared for that celebration.” - Christian Rice, Georgetown University junior
