John Oliver, host of HBO’s “Last Week Tonight,” showed his talent for making complex policy into comedic fodder last night while advocating for the District to become the 51st state.
Oliver went through a laundry list of examples where Congress has intervened in the city’s affairs: abortion rights, gun restriction laws, marijuana legalization and needle exchange programs. 
District officials were quick to praise Oliver for bringing the longstanding issue of statehood to a national audience.
Thanks so much to @LastWeekTonight for raising awareness about DC's second class status. Want to learn more? Visit http://t.co/AjGEvNrJXD!

Chicago-based rapper Vic Mensa will bring an experimental, high-energy performance to U Street Music Hall on August 11.
Vic Mensa gained recognition as a member of the rap group “Kids These Days,” a band that performed at big events like South by Southwest and Lollapalooza, but eventually broke up in 2013. The 22-year-old Chicago native is also a member of SAVEMONEY, a rap collective made of different artists including friend and frequent collaborator Chance the Rapper. 
In 2013 Mensa released his mixtape “Innanetape,” which received generally positive reviews and launched his solo career. The success of “Innanetape” landed Mensa on the XXL magazine’s 2014 freshman class of rappers to watch.
A record deal with RocNation and a collaboration with Kanye West (featured on “U Mad”) have placed Mensa firmly on track to become a fine rapper in his own right.
Mensa’s debut album “Traffic” is set to drop later this year, but fans can expect to hear new material at performances leading up to its release. 
The Chicago rapper’s U Street Music Hall appearance promises to be an outstanding show with the energy and passion that only a swifty rising and truly talented artist can deliver.
Vic Mensa will perform at the U Street Music Hall on August 11. Doors open at 7 p.m. Tickets are available for $25.
