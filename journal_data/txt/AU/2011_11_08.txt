•Maybe the fact that people are resorting to Eagle Rants in order to express their frustration with SPA Leadership should tell you about how unapproachable its director is and how disconnected we all feel from the decision making process. I'm not insulting the program; this program is insulting me.
•Is it lazy to use the automatically opening doors in MGC even if you don't have a handicap?
•No stirrers at the Dav last week. No lids this week. COME ON!

•Having all the Eagle Rants on one day is a bit like binge eating. Having a bit every day is perfect. Please don't go back to the once-a-week format ... It will crush my soul, just a bit. Please. Don't crush my soul.
•Dear can't find a steady hook-up buddy but doesn't want a relationship,
I've been there, keep on keeping on, there are other people that just want to hookup and don't want to be in a relationship. (You might actually end up in a relationship though, because that's what happened to me lol, but it's not something to be feared)
•The line at TDR went all the way up the stairs and went up to the 2nd floor of MGC. The hell?
•Hughes 5 stole a Teddy Bear from a girl on 6th floor and is now holding it hostage. I've never been more disgusted with anything at this university. How pathetic are you guys? Grow up.

•Dear single Jewish girl:
Not so very attached to my Catholicism. We should meet up. I'm the guy who *always* wears polo shirts. Wait ... That won't help you identify me ... Hmm ... I'm a heterosexual male psych major (possibly the only one). If you can't find me, you aren't trying hard enough.
•Dear "Dear “Sometimes I get jealous of rape victims,” your incredible level of stupidity has given me a migraine." You're stupidity is giving ME a migraine. You have no IDEA what I've gone through. Despite what feminists want you to believe, there are worse things in life than rape. And those things don't come with free crisis centers ready to help.
•I am just wondering if there is a rigorous process to join the League of Injustice? Like do you have to steal someone’s shoelace so their shoe is useless? Just curious.
-Hopefully A League Member Soon.
•To the person saying Eagle Ranters are too poor to use eHarmony. No one uses eHarmony. OkCupid is much better and is free. Try and get with the program.
•What the fudge is "SPA Leadership"?
•If it's been three years and you haven't proposed, I am going to dump you. I can't just wait around in a long-distance relationship forever. I need some security. I'm scared you're going to find someone you like better than me ...
•I really wish the counseling center offered anonymous IM counseling like the GLBTQ center offers.
•What exactly do Phonanthon people do? I mean, I know they call alumni, but, like, do they follow a script or do they just try and make conversation and then ask for donations? Just curious.
•No, I am not addicted to painkillers. I'm just going through a really crappy situation in my life, and I think it is illogical that society gives painkiller prescriptions for physical pain but not emotional pain.

•There are so many rats on this campus ... and only half pay tuition!!
•How do all these AU girls get Georgetown boyfriends? Is there like some secret underground, arranged relationship situation going on?
•I Rant so I can feel ....
•AU should make and sell a book of Eagle Rants. It would make the University much more money than the damn WONK campaign. And it would be funny to look back at the stupid things we were so concerned about years later after we have real problems like divorce or cancer.
[Editor’s note: The Eagle has actually thought about creating a Rants book. Would you buy it?]
•Damn Rants god, you censorin’ everything!

•Contrary to the belief among Eagle-Ranters, I have enjoyed my experience in SPA Leadership. I have my complaints, but I choose to have them heard by people who matter. Sorry to disappoint.
•To the "bashed" math major ... let the kiddies come up with their plans to save the world. I'd rather have financial independence and stability in my 20s.
•Dear person who ranted about people who work on campus having it easy: Clearly you don't have an on campus job. You should try it. Nothing is more fun than working four days a week at jobs where you don't get to do your homework, and then coming home and having to do your homework afterward. Sincerely, I haven't had "free time" in three months.
•I know you're the sort of guy that I shouldn't get involved with. I know you only want my body and you might not even know my name, but there's something about you that makes me want you, which is terrible because I have a boyfriend that I love. But when I sleep, you're the one that I dream of ...

•Wise words of Emma Goldman: "I am positive that the men who shed their blood for the independence of this land and who offered up their lives to secure the liberty and rights of the American people, must have had a very different understanding  of the right of free speech than those who today represent the government and who so interpret the right as to permit the expression only of that which is conducive to their benefit."
•Dear guy at American University, when you ask a girl out maybe you should check Facebook to make sure she doesn't have a boyfriend first. Then you won't feel so dumb when you ask out my girlfriend ... Also, you're lucky I'm not the jealous type because that would make our History class super awkward for you.

•Is it just me or do an abnormal amount of girls have mustaches at American? It's gross. Look in the mirror and deal with it because people aren't staring because of your beautiful face.
•Dear "SPA Leadership sent an email over the listserv complaining about us ranting about SPA Leadership. Freedom of speech, baby. The program is an obnoxious resume line.":
•Bash the program all you like, but you cannot say that it's "an obnovious resume line." Let me know the next time that you organize and put into action really useful programs like the Community Service Coalition and tons of other service projects ON TOP OF a normal work load.
•Maybe AU should spend money on things that actually bring students in like renovating EQB, Hurst and Letts or buying power strips for the Library and desks that actually fit my books. Then they could actually show buildings on the prospective student tour other than SIS and have a wider variety of what students major in.
•Can't AU just give the WONK money to students who need the funds?
•WONK campaign budget #thingsthatcouldbebetterused
•I hate reading Eagle Rants written by girls complaining about how much they're looking for a boyfriend. I'm looking for a girlfriend, but these Rants are so torturous because everything on here is anonymous! Arrgh!
•I NEED SOME WORDS OF AFFIRMATION!
[Editor’s note: YES.]
This is the best Rant I've ever read.

•There's a fire starting in my heart, and it's for these impending final papers.
•@The LG Bard,
Thank you for responding! I'm glad to know I'm not the only RPG geek here. If there is an ongoing World of Darkness campaign I would love to join in. Only problem is I don't have any books for it, so I'd have to borrow. Where do the games tend to happen and when?
-Forever alone
•Dear 'people judge me for pressing the stupid button' and 'some disabilities aren't visible'.
I wasn't ranting at you, and I'm sorry that I managed to annoy/offend you. I don't mind people pushing the button, and I totally understand the hands-full thing. It's the people that kick the button that frustrate me; and I don't mean they press it with their foot, I mean they kick it like it were a soccer ball.
•Why do people seem to find it difficult to take the extra two seconds to shut the door quietly during class? There is nothing more annoying to hear and ruder to a professor than a heavy door slamming shut in the middle of a lecture ... COME ON PEOPLE
•@"My FWS job is awesome.” I think we work in the same office. >.> MGC 2nd floor?
•The Eagle needs better writers; whoever wrote the reviews for Tommy and Dr. Horrible desperately needs to be replaced. Not only did they miss the point of the show in both cases but they got the facts WRONG. How can you write a review and get the names of the actors wrong? Credibility Lost.
[Editor’s note: Send an email to editor@theeagleonline.com, and we’ll correct any inaccurate information.]
•@"Screw Tim McBride."
I think, considering past Rants, that there is a significant portion of the AU student body who wants to do just that. So ... yeah.
•We can Rant if we want to, we can leave your friends behind. Cause your friends don't Rant and if they don't Rant, well they're no friends of mine.
•You know your life is strange when you're excited to go back to OHIO so that you can Rant about Korean pop music/dramas. V.V I need more Kpop friends at AU so that I can blast some SHINee and U-Kiss with them <3
•Three things that rock my AU world:
1. Daily Eagle Rants
2. My wonderfully nerdy roommate
3. The Korean Student Association
It is sooo worth the debt that I will be drowning in.
•SPA leadership people are self-centered people who think they are better then everyone else. Me thinks they have no friends outside of the leadership program.
•Nick Rangos, why don't you appreciate my rants??
•I see WONK people.
•Even The Eagle writers can't spell "definitely" correctly. I thought I had escaped this issue in college, but apparently, this word shall haunt me for the rest of my life.
•Dear AU Dems and AUCRs,
Everybody tells us that we are next generation of great leaders, and that we need to fix the problems that today's leaders have failed to mend. By resorting to menial and derogatory remarks about each other for differing ideals or opinions, we are showing that we're no better than the current leaders, as we are just perpetuating the cycle.
Let's debate the issues and work for a solution to today's problems.

Pronto’s new program, Zingle, now offers students the option to text in their order to the food venue in Mary Graydon Center. 
After students text in their order, a machine receives the text and prints it the text on a receipt. The order is ready for pick up in 10 minutes. 
Zingle, the company that manages the program, made its debut this summer at the Bon Appétit regional meeting. It underwent a trial run at other Bon Appétit locations during the fall before it was implemented at AU. 
Michelle Mooney, general manager for Bon Appétit, reported that Bon Appétit saw the feature as a new and improved way for students to order a meal. 
Efforts to execute the new feature revolve around time efficiency. Students will no longer have to wait for their Pronto meals. Instead, their sandwich will be ready upon their arrival to Pronto, where they will pay for their meal. 
“We are sensitive to our customers’ time and want to make their experience at Pronto as time efficient as possible,” described Mooney. “We thought it was a great idea and decided to implement it [at AU].” 
Students react positively to program
Few students have participated in Zingle thus far.
Paula Lopez, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, said Zingle is convenient and ideal, especially when time is limited between her class and work schedule. 
“It was great,” Lopez said. “I texted in my order, and it was ready when I arrived.” 
Isbella Diaz, a sophomore in the School of International Service, also said the program is helpful. 
“It was efficient, convenient and definitely lived up to the 10 minute promise,” stated Diaz. “The fact that I can just text in my order, run to Pronto and pick it up is very good, if not an essential thing for me.”
The future of Zingle
Bon Appétit wants Zingle to have a positive effect on the AU community. 
“We hope students and faculty will embrace the new program and see it as an effective way to get lunch,” Mooney said.
The introduction of Zingle at Pronto is a pilot program. If successful, Bon Appétit may branch the concept to other food venues on campus. There are currently no plans for expansion. 
Menus and order code flyers are available for students to pick up at the Pronto location. To place an order, text (202) 375-5499.

The AU volleyball team maintained its lead atop the Patriot League with home victories over the Holy Cross Crusaders Nov. 4 and the Army Black Knights Nov. 5. 
Eagles easily knock off Crusaders
The Eagles (19-10, 11-1 PL) rolled past the Crusaders (8-21, 4-8 PL) in straight sets, winning by scores of 25-16, 25-17 and 25-6.
The two teams were tied at five early in the opening set before AU took control. The Eagles then won 12 of the next 18 points to lead 17-11, forcing Holy Cross to take a timeout. With AU leading 21-16 later in the game, the Eagles scored four straight points, capped by a Rebecca Heath kill, for the set clincher.
The second set saw three lead changes early on, but the Eagles pulled away again as the game progressed. AU led by as much as 10 points, before another Heath kill gave the Eagles the comfortable 25-17 victory.
AU dominated the third set, as the Eagles hit a game-high .812 while holding Holy Cross to a -.217 hitting percentage. 
Sara Rishell led the Eagles with 13 kills, while Monika Smidova recorded a team-high 20 assists. Defensively, Rishell added three solo blocks while Morgan Hendrix had two blocks to go along with five block assists.
“We have a lot of good hitters that can put the ball away,” Rishell said. “We spread the offense around.”
AU defeats second-place Black Knights
With first place in the conference on the line, the Eagles closed out the weekend by defeating Army 25-18, 25-20, 23-25 and 25-18. 
The first and second sets were very similar, as the teams exchanged scores early on before the Eagles extended their leads late to gain a 2-0 advantage. 
After back-and-forth action to begin the third set, the Eagles took a 12-10 lead and looked to close out Army (20-7, 10-2 PL) in straight sets. The teams then battled down the stretch and, with the game tied at 23, an Army kill followed by Heath’s attack error gave the Black Knights the set.
The Eagles regained control of the match in the fourth set by jumping out to a 12-4 lead. Army cut the AU advantage to 16-13, before the Eagles outscored the Black Knights 9-5 down the stretch for the victory.
“We started the game off strong,” AU Head Coach Barry Goldberg said. “As they were inching back, we needed to stay strong and we were physical by the net.”
Juliana Crum posted double figures in kills (13) and digs (15), while Rishell had a game-high 15 kills. Alexandra Hammer paced the offense with 23 assists.
The Eagles will finish the regular season next weekend when the team hosts Lehigh University Nov. 11 and Lafayette College Nov. 12. 
AU can earn the No. 1 seed in the Patriot League Tournament with a win in one of their final two games.

Women are attracted to washboard abs. They just are, practically all of them. 
I could include some disclaimer that I’m referring mostly to straight women and that I can’t say ‘all’ about anything (suppose I just did), but let’s be real. To claim the eye candy that is Brad Pitt’s “Fight Club” body is not something women salivate over is like denying you picked up the paper only for the Rants (and me, of course).
I shared this thought matter-of-factly a couple weeks ago at our Men of Strength Meeting. 
I didn’t anticipate a controversy, but I might as well have stated, “Murdering puppies can be fun, but only when done in moderation.” 
Immediately, I was put on defense, swatting away criticisms from my friends in the group. Feminists ain’t no monolith I tell ya. 
Many of our discussions focus on the manipulating process of socialization, through which we learn and acquire our norms and values from outside sources. 
For better or worse, we’re constantly encountering signals that betray our inner instincts. Whether we succumb to them or not, we should always be aware they’re lurking. 
Not only do I believe women fawn over six-pack abs, I don’t think they individually can control it. It’s innate, and only countered through the manipulating process of socialization.
For example, take military training. Most recruits who join the forces aren’t blood-lusting sadists. In fact, studies like the one by S.L.A. Marshall have demonstrated that, historically, many soldiers never fired their weapon directly at an enemy. 
Not until recruits are inundated with rigorous training, normalized violence and an emphasis on “shoot first-ask questions later” have troops been able to overcome their aversion to taking another’s life.  
Think about it this way, if people were so innately violent and killing others was natural, why go through the indoctrinating process of training men and women to be killers?
The only way commanders can get their troops to comport with their abhorrent expectations is by countering human nature through socialization. 
The power of socialization is grand, and I don’t contest its efficacy. In fact, my larger point was not about women liking six-packs. It was that, increasingly, women are starting to claim (startlingly) they don’t like abs, as a result of this incredible power of socialization.
Take a cursory glance at popular sit-coms and you’ll find plenty of shows with an out-of-shape husband or boyfriend. With few exceptions, the women remain svelte and sexy. Shows like “The King of Queens,” “Family Guy” “According to Jim,” stuff with Jason Segal, etc.  
Initially, I thought this was awful for men. Why do men have to be portrayed as overweight knuckleheads, constantly outdone by thinner and wittier wives?  
But the more I think about it, the more I find it exonerates rather than confines men. 
The men who write these shows are a clever bunch. They’re enabling men (probably not unlike themselves), who otherwise have no shot with a stunning female, to have the best of both worlds. They get to remain pudgy and disheveled and still hit the aesthetical jackpot. 
Their heftiness is depicted as endearing. Watch these lovable lugs long enough and they’ll wear you down and you’ll see past the rolls and lethargy. A little beer gut is cute, right ladies?
Stop nodding. Cut it out. You’re missing the point. 
Maybe I’m reading too much into this, but I think this pop culture is used as a ploy to render this inequity between the sexes trite.
A deliberate byproduct of these shows is that women accept men for their flaws, while women remain flawless. This is all cloaked in the “laudable virtue” that women are not as shallow as men, but the end result sounds like Ka-ching! for the average out-of-shape bloke.  
And somehow, it’s working! I’m astonished by how many of my (girl) friends remark that a fit body is unimportant. I know their male crushes don’t feel the same. And it’s a tad dubious they inherently do either.   
I’d call that a double standard, one that some women are gullibly embracing. Women can seek a man with a great body and mind; they’re not mutually exclusive. Women shouldn’t settle for this restrictive, complacent narrative.    
My innate nature senses it’s bull.

AU Central will be creating a new staff position to handle veterans’ affairs and AU’s growing student veteran population. 
Office of Campus Life Vice President Gail Hanson said the University is still unsure when this position will be officially created and when the hiring process will begin.
“We’re a couple conversations short of how this is going to work,” Hanson said. “I can’t put a specific timeline on it, but it will be soon.”
Hanson said AU is helping veterans access their benefits, such as federal tuition funding from the GI Bill, and cope with school through the resources currently available. 
“Veteran students have particular needs, and right now they need an expert,” she said.
AU has seen an increase in student veteran enrollment in recent years. Over 204 self-identified veterans are currently enrolled at AU and receive federal Veterans Affairs tuition benefits, according AU Central Associate Director Valerie Verra. 
In 2010, 165 self-identified veterans attended AU, up from 119 student veterans in 2009. 
“The number [of veterans] is growing and with that kind of capacity, we need someone full-time,” Hanson said.
Liaison network aids vets
AU offers help to veterans through a liaison network, which is co-chaired by Verra and Associate Dean of Students Michelle Espinosa. 
AU chose to establish a liaison network rather than a physical Veterans’ Resource Center because they felt this best addressed their needs, Hanson said.
“We thought it would be most appropriate,” she said.
AU and Student Government considered creating a physical Veterans’ Resource Center in 2009, The Eagle previously reported.
“We wanted to create a one-stop resource place for veterans,” Hanson said. “Otherwise it would be taking away from other services.
Veterans work within this network to address issues with each AU department directly, according to Hanson. 
Verra currently acts as the point person for finances and benefits assistance for veterans, in addition to her other duties. Espinosa addresses veterans’ medical and mental health. 
The network offers a variety of academic, financial and other services from different AU faculty and staff in different departments, according to AU’s website. 
Director of Disability Services Joanne Benica, Staff Clinician Charrise Hipol and Academic Counselor Jack Ramsay are some of the faculty and staff in the network.
The AU website provides additional information and links for veterans to better access federal veterans services, such as “A Guide to Choosing the Right GI Bill.”
Vets expect little from AU
AU Vets President John Kamin said veterans do not expect much help from the University because the veterans understand the University’s small amount of existing resources for veterans. 
“Instead of telling the school what we need, we decided to just go ahead and do it,” he said, referring to the veterans’ decision to get what they need without going through the University. 
Kamin said he believes the University does not seem to emphasis the presence of veterans on campus.
“However, the school presently commits little towards pursuing this goal — we do not have a resource center, a full-time staff position responsible for veterans or even a remote presence at student life,” he said in anemail.
But Kamin said veterans understand that their issues, such as accessing government benefits and transitioning into civilian life, are unique to both the University and the student body.
“We can’t expect them to be aware of these issues,” he said.
Kamin said AU Veterans plan to make students, faculty and staff more aware of their presence by holding events.
AU Vets will hold a veteran reception Nov. 11 for Veterans’ Day. They will also hold a conference in January to demonstrate to faculty how to better educate veteran students. 
Veterans also spoke in College Writing classes earlier this fall for their summer reading book “The Good Soldier,” The Eagle previously reported.
AU Veterans want to be more active in the AU community and to offer advice to those on campus interested in the military, according to Kamin.
“We were also trying to tell the school we have stuff to give,” he said.

AU was ranked as one of the top 16 vegan-friendly colleges in PETA’s nationwide competition last week. 
Last year AU finished second in the competition, close behind Northwestern University. In 2008, AU won the title of most vegan-friendly campus in the nation.  	
“We are not sure why the decrease in rankings happened,” Bon Appétit Management Company Director Michelle Mooney said. “We continue to listen to the students, read the comment cards, and meet with students to meet their expectations.”
Some students said they were shocked by the results as well because they enjoy the quality and quantity of vegan options at AU.
“AU has a lot of vegan-friendly options around campus that I don’t see why we were eliminated so early,” College of Arts and Sciences junior Morgan Wheaton said. “Despite the competition, I think there is still something to say for the amount of options AU gives.” 
PETA will decide the most vegan-friendly school by whoever wins the bracket. The organization did not give specific rankings for each school since the competition has not finished. 
AU was defeated in the second round in the “Small Schools” bracket. Bennington College, Brandeis University, Brown University, University of Rochester all moved on to the next round of the bracket.  
Brown University, Brandeis University, Northwestern University and Georgetown University are still competing for the title of “most vegan-friendly school.” The winner will be announced on Nov. 21.
In their 2010 report, PETA referred to AU as “one of our top schools over the past several years” and described AU as “representing ‘the District’ proudly with vegan options worthy of national praise.” 
PETA2, a branch of PETA that focuses on college students, sponsored this year’s competition.  
It takes four factors into consideration when rating each school: 
1.) Number of votes received
2.) Quality and variety of vegan food
3.) School’s enthusiasm in promoting their options
4.) Student feedback
AU’s on-campus vegan-friendly options
AU hosts many vegan-friendly options on campus in TDR, Tavern and Boxed Lunch such as grains, tempeh, seitan, legumes and tofu.  
TDR’s dessert station offers vegan desserts and ice cream. 
Other vegan-friendly vendors on campus include:
1.) Pronto
2.) Einstein Bagels
3.) Mega Bytes 
4.) Eagle’s Nest  
AU has increased its selections of vegan-friendly food based on student demand. Mooney feels there were not any changes made to AU’s food venues that would have negatively impact the voting in the PETA competition.
“We feel we have increased the offerings this year per the student requests,” Mooney said.
She said students seem to have become more conscientious about sustainable food practices as more vegan options have been added on campus in the past six years. As more students request vegan friendly food, Bon Appétit makes efforts to prepare and serve this food, she said. 
“I was surprised when we didn’t with the competition,” School of Public Affairs sophomore Meredith Allen said. “Hopefully the competition will help AU work hard to improve our vegetarian and vegan options on campus for the next competition.”

Just as one might wake up with a hangover after New Year’s, the government wakes up with a hangover at the beginning of a new fiscal year, said Heritage Foundation economic expert Alison Fraser.
Comparing the fiscal year to New Year’s Day, Fraser spoke about the current state of the economy at an AU College Republicans event Nov. 1
“Our hangover for the federal government is our debt,” she said. 
Fraser spoke to an audience of around 15 students in the University Club. Her organization, the Heritage Foundation, conducts conservative public policy research.
Fraser also discussed specific economic problems facing the United States and potential solutions to these problems.
“We are seeing a dramatic increase in the size and scope of our debt,” she said.  
America’s debt will only get worse with the direction the United States is headed in now, she said.  
“Our lesson learned, if any, from the EU’s experiences is that we are just a couple of years behind having to deal with the same issues,” she said.  
After explaining the issues, Fraser talked about solutions that the Heritage Foundation has supported in the past.  
“I would do it all on the spending side without raising taxes,” she said. “Rather than taxing the rich, I would rather take away their benefits,” referring to Social Security and Medicare.
Taxes make economic growth more difficult, she said.
“We’ve got to do this in a way that makes everyone’s future brighter,” Fraser said.
Fraser encouraged the students in attendance to talk to their parents and grandparents about these issues over Thanksgiving. 
She challenged students to ask them, “What are you going to do to help me?” 
“A lot of these solutions are going to rely on us having a conversation,” she said. 	
The solutions Fraser proposed seemed to resonate with many of the students at the event.  
“I really think she made a lot of sense,” said Ella Davis, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs. “She had some really good ideas for the economy in the long term.”  
Charles Merrick, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, had a different opinion. 
“I generally liked the speech,” Merrick said. “I didn’t necessarily agree with things, but they made their points well.”  
Merrick said he was invited to the event by some of his Republican friends and attended because of his interest in economics.  
“It’s important to be open to other opinions,” he said.

Correction appended
Dr. Horrible is a musically gifted supervillain on his way to greatness — or at least, that’s what he wants to think. The sad truth is that he is a wannabe villain who has a crush on the laundry girl next door.
And on Nov. 5, AU Players performed the famed online musical, “Dr. Horrible’s Sing Along Blog” to a packed audience in the Kreeger Building. 
“Dr. Horrible’s Sing Along Blog” was originally aired as an online-only miniseries in 2008. It is a tragicomedy written by Joss Whedon (creator of “Buffy”) that follows Dr. Horrible’s (Neil Patrick Harris, “How I Met Your Mother”) blog on his quest to become a member of the Evil League of Evil. 
In the original web short, Dr. Horrible is trying to become a supervillain while simultaneously hoping to romantically pursue his laundry buddy, Penny, (Felicia Day, “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”). Along the way his nemesis, Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion, “Castle”), gets in the way of both goals.
AU Players’ adaptation of “Dr. Horrible’s Sing Along Blog” had few, if any, alterations to the original dialogue. 
Their version was much more simplistic in its set and props, but that certainly did not take away from the fun. 
The audience likely recognized that some of the props even came from around AU, including bowls from TDR and recycling bins that served as tables. 
The chorus of supporting actors each wore jeans, sneakers, different colored T-shirts and even served as props.
AU Players provided the audience with lyrics for all of the songs. The audience members who did not know the songs by heart were looking down at the paper frequently if they wanted to sing, resulting in them missing out on the performances. 
The performance had a projector that served as part of the set itself, but it may have been beneficial to also use it to show the lyrics, keeping the crowd’s eyes on the stage. 
Even so, most of the audience did not seem to mind, since many were jovially singing along and joining in the Dr. Horrible fun.
At times there were members of the audience who were singing loudly or making comments over the actors’ performances. They were a distraction to the show, but the actors never broke character. They often even paused when someone was making a loud comment so the audience would not miss the line. 
The actors were adaptive so that the audience did not lose a moment of “Dr. Horrible’s Sing Along Blog” due to disruptive participants.
Will Putnam, who played Dr. Horrible, had Neil Patrick Harris’ shoes to fill. Putnam easily managed the balance between anarchist nemesis and love-struck boy. 
Similarly, Carter Lowe fulfilled Nathan Fillion’s handsome and cocky persona, Captain Hammer.
Penny (Samantha Oakes) and Moist (Sean Reilly Wood) also delivered excellent performances in their respective roles. Oakes has a beautiful singing voice that suits her innocent character. Reilly Wood was a successful supporting character to Putnam’s Dr. Horrible and managed not to get buried under the main roles.

A previous version of this article inaccurately stated that Eric Tengi played Moist in the show. Sean Reilly Wood played Moist.
