The District of Columbia Council is considering a bill that if passed, would revoke the ability for students with out-of-state cars to apply for reciprocity parking permits. The measure would force students to change their vehicle registration from their home state to the District of Columbia in order for them to be able to legally park on the street, which has students up in arms.
“This puts an undue burden on students, says American University Student Government President Tim McBride. “You can’t pass a law that specifically says students have to do something, but everyone else doesn’t have to. Thats’s unfair and it violates D.C. law and the values of this city.”
McBride said he feels the bill violates the 1977 D.C. human rights act, which prohibits discrimination against suspect classes and includes matriculation as a class. 
Students react to the proposed bill:
 
Currently, students, members of the military, congressional members, presidential appointees, and diplomats are allowed to apply for a one-year renewable reciprocity permit, without having to register their cars in the District. The new proposed law would “prevent full-time students who reside within the District of Columbia from being issued or from using a reciprocity parking sticker for out-of-state vehicles.” D.C. law currently prevents students at Georgetown University from receiving reciprocity permits.
Not all streets are “Residential Permit Parking,” or RPP streets, however many of the streets in the surrounding neighborhoods of American University do require permits in order for cars to be parked in front of houses on the street.
If students live on an RPP street and would like to park their cars on the street in front of their houses, they would be required to register their vehicle in the District of Columbia. In order for a vehicle to be registered in the District, the driver must have proof of D.C. insurance coverage and a valid D.C. driver’s license in addition to paying the applicable fees.
In order for students to obtain a D.C. drivers license, they must change their residency to the District of Columbia, which has some students concerned about their ability to vote in their home states where they feel their vote would have more of an impact on elections.
ANC 3D, which represents the AU area voted on a resolution Wednesday night, showing their support for the council’s bill. The vote was 6 to 1, with the only nay vote being Commissioner Deon Jones, who is also an AU student.
ANC Commissioner Tom Smith, who represents many AU students, offers his reaction to the bill:

The bill, B19-217 The Residential Parking Protection Amendment Act is co-sponsored by five out of the 13 council members and was first introduced in April of 2011. It has since been referred to the committee on Public Works and Transportation that will hold a public hearing on Tuesday at 10:30am. Students from AU and D.C.’s neighboring universities are expected to attend to show their support against the bill.

•I just want to talk to you like a normal human being instead of tripping over my tongue when I meet your eyes.



•Is it just me or do you feel the sexual tension too?
•I'm part of the 99% that procrastinated all this work until the end of the semester and tries to rid ourselves of the blame by focusing on how much work we have to do, instead of WHY we have to do it right NOW.
•I'm a freshman and I consider most people on the east coast REALLY weird. And I see all the freshman everyday because this is a small school. #needtotransfer #california
•What am I going to do without seeing President Rangos for over a month? #longdistancerangoslove?

•Dear Editor,
I have a girl crush on you too.
Love,
Elizabeth Olsen
[Editor’s note: Elizabeth Olsen is totes this editor’s fave actress.]
•I don't think you know what I want. Once you hear me out, I think you will change your mind and go along with it all. A month is a long time and it will eat me alive not knowing how you sincerely feel... in all honesty. If think I am as young as my age, you're wrong. Just please listen, you mean more to me than you think.
•To buy a sprite from the Letts vending machines you have to press C4. This amuses me immensely.
•@"Considering napping in the library: DO IT. i did it. definitely no shame.
•You know what sucks? The Creationism vs. Evolution debate. I have a solution for all of you: God created evolution. There. Everyone wins.

•I honestly have no idea why so many people ask me for relationship advice. I've never been in a relationship before

•AUTO! I hate you!
•I hate it when people leave rants that aren't rants- "I love AU so much. I'm so glad I didn't go to my state school where everyone... has the same political views.... At AU I get to meet people from all over the country and all over the world.... So glad I chose AU." This paper toots the University's horn enough as it is. I come to Eagle Rants for a DISSENTING OPINION, dammit!
•Weekend eagle rants are the best thing ever!
•YES TO THE GRAFFITI ROCK
•It was my last weekend at AU before going Abroad...and none of my friends cared...

•Am I the only one whose parents have not paid for any part of my education? Because I honestly feel like I am.
•Why is my unwanted suitor trying to hang out with me more than my friends? There is a problem here.
•People call me a gold digger, but they just want what I have.
•You always complain about not getting a rant here but you never read them when I write one about you!! Ugh, you're impossible and I can never please you
•That awkward moment when you and your roommate accuse each other of writing the same Rant.
•I wish it was easier to pretend some people didn't exist.
•Twenty questions with the Editor is getting annoying. Editor, don't feed the troll monster. Ignore this person!
[Editor’s note: Don’t worry, already considering it.]
•Where are all the snazzy events where I can re-wear all of my high  school homecoming dresses and my fabulous collection of heels?
•Anybody on the second floor of the library have a pen I can borrow?
•Creepy senior, please stop texting me. Single doesn't mean I'm looking for somebody.
•Last night (Saturday night, Sunday morning) I shared an elevator ride with an extremely chivalrous and kind military man in Leonard. Round 1:30am. If you remember, and felt some sort of connection, rant back. I love a man in uniform.
•According to a chemist, why is the world so diverse? Because theres alkynes of people
•If you are a Packers fan, give a shout out for A-Rod and the crew! 13 and 0 ALL THE WAY!
•I am in love with my TA, dear lord. what a gosh darn stud. I always thought this whole "oh, I like my TA" thing was silly, but mmm, girl, I would pay for that.
•The WONK campaign sucks. But I gotta make sure to catch the Eat Wonky truck before I leave for winter break. (There's no cognitive dissonance there, right?)
•Silent study lounges need sound proof walls. Girls in the hallway: what are you DOING.
•Why does everyone hate on Football? It's a great way to exercise, have fun, and work out pent-up aggression and stress! So please don't hate on it just because you're jaded, unathletic, and got picked last for kickball in in 5th grade.
•TEDDY PLEASE POST ANOTHER BLOG POST I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR LIFE
•This weekend was the best. I can conquer anything now.
•I have to wait in the lounge to sign a stupid form and I can't leave to study and everyone in the lounge is talking at the top of their freaking lungs and can't shut up.
•secretly - no, publicly - I'm hyperproud of convincing my 7y.o. cousin to be my penpal. procrastinating on studying by drawing him a picture of us riding a woolly mammoth? YES.
•That awkward moment when everyone thinks you were a lot drunker than you actually were.
•"You didn’t specify yes/no questions. But fine, are you in SOC?" Yes
[Editor’s note: Are we Facebook friends?]
•mrrrroow!
•Seize the day. For the pure reason that life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.
•#OccupyNickRangos
•To the cute blonde girl in the Renaissance and Revolutions class,
You are absolutely adorable.  You're sweet, smart, and everything I want. Will you go on a date with me?
•FINALS MAKE ME HORNY... why do I have to possess such a high standard of morals that I won't allow myself to jump the guy that lives across the hall?!?!? I AM GOING TO GO CRAZY!!!!
•I like you more than I'll ever let on, even though I tell you how much I like you all the time.
•I can't stop thinking about you, boy who I flirted with in college writing class last semester. It's been so long, and I rarely see you, but you were perfect for me. Just so you know. I wonder if you ever think about me...
•I may be a little bit of a biddie, but you're a cheater. So don't judge because what you do is way worse than anything I've done.
•When I write a dissertation or I become a doctor and have to write articles because being a doctor requires it, I'll make sure to make them one column, double spaced, easily accessible, free, and make sure its edited by three people- A professor in English, a professor in my field, and a professor in education. That way I’m sure that I'm clear and concise, I make sure that my paper is something new and innovative to the field and is accurate yet debatable, and make sure that its simple and understandable to even a senior in high school.
•I know you don't like me as more than friends, and I know I have a boyfriend, but every time you talk, I take my earphones out just to hear your voice.
•Before I came to AU I was already addicted to Dating in the District entries. Someone bring them back!
•Dear beautiful post back in my bio class who lives with his identical twin-- you are so sexy. Let's be friends. Or at least introduce me to your twin brother. ;)
•STFU with all the finals stuff! Everybody is in the same boat so get over it. No one is trying to compete and top everyone else by having the most finals! Take them, be done with them, enjoy your vacations!
•really AU?! you kick me out of ward first cause it is closed and then at 4 in the morning you kick me off the second floor of MGC cause it is "closed" as well? do you think that i am going to vandalize or steal something when i'm trying to study for my finals?
•"anderson third floor is too much to handle." #winning
•I find it mind-boggling that the biddies next door can't wake up to an alarm repeating the same ten seconds of some crappy pop song for fifteen minutes. It wakes me up through the wall, how are you still asleep!?!
•That awkward moment when a group of people you just met start talking about things they can't imagine someone doing... and you've done all of those things.
•@Real metaphysics--I think I love you.
•Seven days left abroad!!!! I know I should be sad, but by now you've seen my countdown and know last week was really hard for me. Five finals and a week stand between me and the good ol' US of A!!!
•You were a mistake I had to make.
•To my two professors who just gave our class 4 and 6 day extensions on the final papers, respectively, I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOUUUUUU. (Yes, I have finished both already but I really wanted to work on them some more.)
•I don't want to go home for break AT ALL. I have too much fun at AU, and I'm going to miss my friends so so much when I go abroad next semester :(
•'Tis the season to zealously check for your grades to be posted. Fa la la la la, la la la laaaa.
•Why, whenever I'm attracted to confident, outgoing guys, do they turn out to have the worst self-confidence problems? I wish I wasn't a nice enough person to stick around and help them through it. It's not what I signed up for.
•Finals aren't actually that bad when you drink your way through them like a man...
•That awkward moment when... you nerdgasm because you realize that, although you can't solve this math problem, you DO finally know how to make Mathematica solve it for you.
•dear God, Zia's Song is stuck in my head and it's such a pleasurable torment. Na NA na na nahAaa.
