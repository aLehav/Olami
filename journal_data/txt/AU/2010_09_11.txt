The AU College Democrats and College Republicans both have many plans for expanding their groups on campus and becoming more involved with the D.C. community, starting with the National Day of Service and Remembrance on Sept. 11.
The College Republicans participated in the Freedom Walk. This event was created in 2005 to establish a national tradition of remembrance of the lives lost on Sept. 11, 2001, according to College Republican President Stephen Laudone.
The College Republicans will also be working on a community service initiative at Walter Reed Hospital on Nov. 11, Veterans Day.
The College Republicans and College Democrats have also doubled their outreach efforts, with revamped websites, new Facebook groups and fan pages for members to join and stay in touch.
College Democrats President Bo Hammond said the College Democrats have added an internship board to their site for the first time. He said this has been set up to help members of AUCD get jobs, and in the past has secured internships on Capitol Hill and at WeatherizeDC, a non-profit based campaign in D.C. focusing on home efficiency.
The College Republicans have arranged several outings, starting with a meet and greet session at the Tenleytown Z-Burger, followed by a weekend trip to a Nationals game. They have also booked a number of speakers for the upcoming months, such as Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., sometime in September or October and former United States Senator Rick Santorum, R-Pa., in November.
The College Republicans are also co-sponsoring the Kennedy Political Union's Family Weekend event on Oct. 23. Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York City and presidential candidate, is scheduled to speak. 
Laudone said he is focused on expanding the community service wing of his organization.
“It is important for the [College Republicans] to walk the walk on this [service] issue, so you will see us engaging more than in past years in community service initiatives of our own and with the Community Service Coalition,” he said.
The College Democrats have a themed schedule entitled, “Blue Rising.” This is a six-week period during which they have scheduled many events, starting with advertising and recruitment in the first couple of weeks.
Hammond believes that this will be the best year for the College Democrats.
“We are going to have more members and more resources than we have ever had in the past,” he said.

• What is up with all the mosquitoes on campus? I'm here all summer, get maybe five bites and BAM school starts and my legs look like they’ve walked through a stagnant pond. Blaming all of you for the blood loss.
• To whoever was complaining about the new SIS building: 
Please allow AU to spend money making the other majors learning facilities usable before you complain about not having LEAFY GREENS AND A WATERFALL. I hope you realize how excessive that is. 
Thank you, 
Someone who is here for educational purposes rather than having a serene environment while I drink my davenport coffee.
• Come on rude boy can you get up
Cause I wonk wonk wonk
What you wonk wonk wonk
So tell me what you wonk, what you really really wonk,
I’ll tell you what I wonk, what I really really wonk
I wonka I wonka I wonka really wonka zigga zigga ah!
• Dear disgruntled AU students,
Please smile. Life is so much better when you try to put a little sunshine out there.
:)
• I transferred last semester and I love reading the rants to see what I'm not missing at AU.
• Eagle Rants is an embarrassment to the entire university and should be abolished immediately.
EDITOR’S NOTE: No.
• I have no sympathy for people who can't get real jobs after they graduate. They didn't take advantage of the internships available in D.C.
• Dear Housing & Dining: 
Thank you for screwing up Roper so badly that our toilets barely work anymore. Glad to know that my $35k a year is going towards "WONK" T-shirts and not functioning bathrooms.
• I am so insecure. It sucks. I've been here only a couple weeks and already I feel like I'm going out of my mind. I finally decided to go out last night and the guy I took with me turned out to be straight. Of all the gay people here, I had to pick the straight guy. Seriously? This is a joke, right?
• To the girl in love with philosophy guy – if it's a certain class we're talking about I know who you are referring to, and he is gorgeous. Good thing I'm a guy!
• I've never hated a person in my entire life ... until I met one of my professors this semester.
• There should be a way for Eagle Rants people to meet up.  There's a lot of AU love, and such people should become face to face friends.
• I want someone I can run up to and put my arms around.
• Dump your unaffectionate, inattentive boyfriends! Best decision I ever made. They aren't worth it. And you deserve better!
• 1. To affluent law student: this is to not say you are unsuccessful but someday you will thank your parents for making you appreciate paying for things on your own.  Believe in yourself and know that you paying for things on your own will be beneficial.
2. Yes AU rules.
3.  Off campus living is nice but I can assure you that you are not alone. Even living in the Berks has made me feel alone. I stare out my window and there's no life in each apartment.
• If it helps any of you museum-going, mildly drinking, low key folk ... I AM ONE TOO!!! Don’t worry about being a minority, just do your thang!
• I have no idea what’s going on in any of the classes related to my major.
• To the Centennial dwellers who now share a bathroom with my hell-on-earth former roommate: I'm so sorry.
• Can people please learn to cover their mouths when they cough?  Didn't you learn about germs in preschool? Have some courtesy for others. I don't want your nastiness.
• Please love me like you used to! I can’t take this anymore. I love you! I need you! Why are you doing this to me?
• I've been congested and coughing for the last week ... I think I've got the Wonk.
• What’s the point of a three day weekend if we aren't allowed in the damn library?
• When did all the Eagle rants get so emo? Write that stuff in your diaries everyone, seriously.
• You have broken my heart. I am numb inside and can only stare blankly at the sea of faces I come across. I am dead inside now thanks to you. Save me!
• To the person complaining about getting kicked off campus: 
My roommate and I went to the room draw last semester, and even though we both had really high lottery numbers, we got a room in Centennial. Easily. It was wide open. You obviously didn't really care that much about living on campus and just like to bitch and whine.
• If I needed another Chris Matthews to express their sourpuss attitude and liberal opinions towards the upcoming election, when the Republicans WILL take the House, I would have applied to AU.
oh, wait...
• Eagle rants is not an advice column. Eagle rants is not a relationship column. EAGLE RANTS IS NOT FOR SOLACE, IT'S HERE TO PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.
• Whatever happened with Artemas Ward Week last year? Did that ever end up happening? If not, will we have two this year to make up for it?
• Dear everyone with relationship issues: Talk to your significant other about it. Seriously. It doesn't matter what’s bothering you. It is astounding how much easier it is to work through issues together.
• What's with the bureaucracy here at American? None of the people who work at the school or in the registrar know what's going on. Last week I was trying to get an override form for a class I needed, I asked three different people and got three different answers. So much for paying almost $50,000 a year, right?
• Why are only a small minority of the AU events made into Facebook events?  Is it that hard to make a Facebook event?  Note to people creating events at AU: If you make a Facebook group for it, then more people will show up. Pretty simple.
• I'm sick of being sick!
• Bilingual guys are very hot. I love you all.
• Where is our POTUS op-ed!?!? Eagle editors, get with it!
• To the person who posted "To the person who has had sex in the library, you are a pig.  Go back to whereever you come from and have sex in your own goddamn library. " I would like to say that your grammar and spelling are impeccable. Really shows some class!
• I miss the old days when I could get drunk any day of the week. Now I'm working two jobs and would rather go to bed by 11 p.m.
• Dear College Democrats,
Why would you close the doors to the event on Thursday night after it started?  Some people have evening classes and would have liked to have slipped in late without making a disturbance. Think about that in the future please.
• I'm a very quiet person, I've had people say that they think I'm stuck up cause I don't talk much, but in reality I just don't want to say something awkward and stupid.
