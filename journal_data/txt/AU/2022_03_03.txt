Eagles by nature are apex predators, and they made the Holy Cross Crusaders their prey March 2. 
The American University men’s basketball team (10-21) vanquished (9-22) Holy Cross 69-63 to advance to the Semi-Finals of the Patriot League Tournament against the Navy Midshipmen (19-10). The Eagles entered the game on an upswing.
Ranked last in the PL Tournament, AU entered Hart Center Arena after a pillar to post victory over the sixth-ranked Loyola Maryland (14-15) Saturday, Feb. 27. 65-55. AU took the momentum from a momentous senior day and used it to slaughter the legions of Holy Cross Crusaders fans in the student section. 
The game was a back-and-forth affair in the early goings of the first half. Holy Cross ran their offense through Gerrale Gates to start the game, and the undersized Crusader forward thrashed AU the entire game to finish with 18 points. 
Holy Cross was inefficient throughout the first half. The Crusaders held a 15-14 lead with 11 minutes left, but the Eagles soared past their ironclad opponents and never relinquished the lead again. 
Shooting was an issue for the Eagles. The Crusaders were last in team field goal percentage all season, and their struggles to put the ball in the net continued against AU. 
Holy Cross shot just under 44 percent from the field and 22 percent from long range. The Crusaders were also surprisingly careless with the ball in the first half. Fifth of 10 in the PL in turnover margin, the Crusaders coughed the ball up 10 times in the opening period.
The Eagles, who have surrendered 414 turnovers this season, were noticeably protective of the ball finishing the half with four giveaways. AU senior and 2021-2022 All-Patriot League selection Stacy Beckton Jr. led the Eagles’ soaring attack. Time and again, he attacked the basket, fought through contact and baffled defenders with cyclone-like spin moves, and he led the Eagles with 23 points. Beckton wasn’t the only source of offense for the Eagles though.

AU deployed head coach Mike Brennan’s Princeton offense to perfection all game. The Eagles used backdoor passes, screens and cuts to the basket to repeatedly cook the Crusaders’ interior defense and secure easy points in the paint.
Holy Cross’ swiss cheese defense was powerless to stop AU’s effortless attacks, the Eagles so confident in their ability to score in the paint they took only three shots from beyond the arc the entire game, and a Crusader fan in the stands yelled “watch the backdoor!” after they had given up yet another easy look to the Eagles. 
AU freshman Elijah Stephens orchestrated the Eagles’ selfless offense. The PL All-Rookie guard dished out a team-high eight assists and dropped 12 points during the contest, spinning to the basket-like Beckton and drawing fouls to finish 8-8 from the free-throw line.

Stephen’s dimes benefitted his backcourt mate Colin Smalls the most. The sophomore guard took two feeds from the freshman to the rim, and one fastbreak pass Smalls turned into a one-handed tomahawk destruction of Holy Cross guard DáJion Humphrey.

Fellow senior Josh Alexander contributed offense off the bench too. Alexander attacked the shorter Gates in the paint repeatedly, using his trademark hook shot and interior play to collect 10 points.

Holy Cross at times stagnated when they could not get offense from Gates, and the Eagles took full advantage to take a 32-28 lead going into halftime. The second half was similar to the first.
AU held a lead the entire half. Beckton Jr. and Stephens continued to draw fouls and sink their free throws, and the visitors outrebounded the landlocked Crusaders 20-11. The Eagles seemed to put the game away with 3:40 left in the half with a 63-51 lead. 
However, the Crusaders’ offensive came alive, as the Eagles’ offense sputtered and the specter of elimination stared Holy Cross in the face. Holy Cross went on a 12-3 run to cut AU’s lead to three with 13 seconds left in the game, but it wasn’t enough and AU held on to win.
The win is momentous for the Eagles. AU has not made it out of the first round of the Patriot League tournament since 2015-2016 when they beat Boston University. 
“We knew we were going to have to work for it,” Brennan said postgame. “They were a tough out, but our guys hung in there and played tough.”
Brennan also said the win was good practice for their second-round matchup against Navy at Alumni Hall Thursday at 7 p.m. EST. The Eagles have played the Midshipmen six times in the last two years. They lost all six matchups.

Editor’s note: This story contains references to substance use and overdose. Please see the bottom of this story for additional resources.
What if it was as easy for high school and college students to access fentanyl testing strips as it was for them to access condoms? 
Six months ago, Beth Weinstock made it her mission to place fentanyl testing strips in the hands of every high school and college student in the country. Weinstock spoke at American University on Feb. 28 for her organization BirdieLight, which works to prevent fentanyl-related deaths and place fentanyl test strips in the hands of high school and college students. 
Weinstock is the mother of a former AU student Eli Weinstock who passed away a year ago from fentanyl poisoning in March 2021. Since starting BirdieLight with her daughter, the organization has distributed fentanyl test strips and educational materials to schools and organizations across the country.
“We have to be bold in our solutions and admit that the ‘just say no to drugs’ message is important, but it's not working completely,” Weinstock said during the event. 
The event was part of School of Communication professor Gemma Puglisi’s Public Relations portfolio class, where students work with a client throughout the semester on public relations and messaging strategies. There were also events throughout the week that the students in Puglisi’s class worked with Weinstock to put on, including tabling and distributing fentanyl testing strips on campus and a fundraiser pool tournament at the Glover Park bar Breadsoda.
Weinstock, who is also a physician, said that although she does not condone drug usage, telling people not to do drugs isn’t enough to fight this crisis. This is especially pertinent as BirdieLight tries to reach high school students, she said. 
Weinstock and BirdieLight are also working to destigmatize fentanyl test strips. She showed students how to use a test strip – crush up a pill, put it in a small amount of water in a cup and put the strip in for 15 seconds. Two lines on the strip means the drug is negative, and one line mean the drug has tested positive for fentanyl. If the test is negative, that pill can still be consumed by drinking the water it was tested in, she said. If it is positive, the drug should be thrown out immediately. 
“I think probably we still think of fentanyl as something that is injected into the veins of someone addicted to heroin, that we still … like to ‘other’ people that have gotten themselves addicted to opioids,” she said. 
One of the goals of BirdieLight is to find young people in what Weinstock referred to as the “middle space” – first-time or recreational drug use. This space, Weinstock said, is where this education is needed the most.
“People who try things don't deserve to die. People who use cocaine once a month or twice a month don't deserve to die. College kids who do a line of cocaine for the first time on a rooftop apartment building while watching a football game don't deserve to die,” she said. 
Fentanyl is the leading cause of death for people aged 18-45 in the U.S., what Weinstock called “the crisis of a generation.” In 2015, the U.S. had reached more deaths from fentanyl poisoning than the country had had at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. More than 100,000 people died from drug-related deaths between April 2020 and April 2021, the first time that number has reached six figures in any 12 month period. More people die from fentanyl-related deaths than any other drug. 
“We don't lose this many young people per year in wars, to cancer, to car accidents. Nothing gets close,” she said. 
Weinstock explained that in 1988, the federal government sent a flier to every U.S. household in the mail warning people of the dangers of HIV and urging condom use and educating people on how to stay safe. That was only three years after the HIV epidemic began, and she wonders where the same action is from the government on fentanyl. 
Weinstock put the fentanyl epidemic in the context of other major events that Americans typically associate with widespread fatalities: In 2020, nearly 70,000 people died from fentanyl deaths. The Vietnam War Memorial wall holds 58,281 names. At the peak of the AIDS epidemic in 1995, fatalities totaled about 50,000 lives.
“Where's our fentanyl flier? Why aren't we getting the equivalent of a mailer to every household in the United States? This crisis surpasses that one,” she said. “Why so little response in the public space about fentanyl-related deaths? I would argue that probably it's because of [the] stigma.”
She shared three steps with students that she wants them to keep in mind if they are experimenting with drugs:
1. Test the substance – and dispose of it if the test is positive
2. Tell someone you are using the substance
3. Keep Narcan on hand
Narcan, also known as naloxone, is a nasal spray that can be used to treat opioid overdoses. Narcan is available for free at D.C. pharmacies with or without a prescription, as well as from the Opioid Learning Institute. 
Beyond just testing strips and education, Weinstock is also involved in advocacy work and said she is encouraged by President Joe Biden’s support of federal dollars being able to go toward harm reduction. BirdieLight has applied for 501(c)(3) status, and she hopes to apply for federal grants to continue the work of harm reduction. Additionally, she wants to see harm reduction curriculum being taught in schools and hopes to start a BirdieLight ambassador program, where students on campuses across the country can work to spread BirdieLight’s message and distribute the testing strips. 
“The truth is, right now in this country we don't just have an opioid crisis, which sadly I think the public has grown weary of,” she said. “Right now, we also have a poisoning crisis and they run parallel to each other. There's some crossover, but it's misguided to equate them. There's the opioid addiction crisis, and then there's this poisoning crisis.” 
Weinstock said that BirdieLight does not use the word overdose when talking about fatalities, as overdose implies that the person taking the fentanyl was using it on a regular or daily basis. In reality, she said, the vast majority of people who die from ingesting fentanyl did not know they were taking it. 
She’s seeing results in her work, too. Weinstock said a group of college students who had received test strips from BirdieLight used the strips to test ecstasy they were planning on taking at a music festival. After the test strips showed up as positive, they threw away the drugs.
Weinstock encouraged students to use the testing strips, carry Narcan and educate their friends. She also encouraged students to ask AU to make testing strips available to students on campus, similar to how HPAC and the Health Center distribute condoms. Currently, testing strips are available in the district from HIPS and Bread for the City. She said people can also contact BirdieLight to get testing strips.  
As Weinstock travels the country and speaks to young people in high school and college, she sees this work as a final act of parenting Eli. 
“This is my way of keeping my relationship with him, caring for him, ongoing,” she said, in an interview with The Eagle. “It's not what I want, it's not the way I want, but when I can speak to other young adults, and I can talk about Eli and I can make something good happen, then I feel like I'm in some ways taking care of him.” 
With every test strip distributed and every potential life saved, she knows that her action is not fully a replacement for her grief.
“What I always have to recognize is that I have to take care of my grief too. I can't just say BirdieLight displaces that – it doesn't. So on some days, I just turn off and I say that today I'm taking care of my grief. What that means for me is I go to the cemetery, I look at pictures, look at videos, connect with an old friend of his, whatever it takes, but I honor it,” she said. “Because it's not healthy to just say BirdieLight does that for me. BirdieLight exists in addition to my grief. So I spend those days just unplugging and honoring it, however painful it is.”
In all of her work, she hopes that the word people use to remember Eli isn’t fentanyl.
“Everybody who met Eli thought he was hilarious, and he was, with a dry, sarcastic sense of humor. He could drop a one-liner in a very inappropriate quiet moment that would make everyone laugh, even though you knew you shouldn't be laughing,” she said. “He had this really wicked sense of humor, and he loved his family more than anything.”

The Eagle hosted a roundtable discussion with multiple student-led affinity and cultural organizations Feb. 17 with the goal of identifying areas that we have overlooked or underreported in the past so we can better serve the community.
Editors present at the meeting asked questions about how each organization wanted to see themselves reflected in The Eagle’s coverage, what types of coverage would lend itself best to each organization, harmful stereotypes frequently seen in the media that should be avoided in reporting and what The Eagle and other mainstream media tend to get wrong.
The Eagle is using this input to help generate story ideas, such as increasing coverage of queer students of color, transgender and nonbinary students, students on the aromantic spectrum, the presence of ableism on campus, racial and ethnic identity and more.
Editors also asked questions about how communication and transparency could be made more effective. As a result of this feedback, The Eagle published a guide to our reporting and interviewing methods in order to make interviewees more well-informed of our reporting processes and the journalistic terminology a reporter may use with them if they are ever approached for an interview. 
Based on feedback about our reporting processes from the student groups at the roundtable, editors also discussed trauma-informed interviewing practices with reporters in the event of reaching out to an affinity or cultural group for comment about a tragedy or other negative event that has affected them.
The Eagle and select student groups also discussed expanding the pool of students being contacted for interviews on particular issues as a way to diversify the voices being featured in our coverage.
If your student organization or club would like to be involved in the next roundtable discussion, please contact editor@theeagleonline.com.

As a Feb. 19 game proved, the weight of ten other players is too much for the shoulders of fifth-year seniors Emma Vinall and Kendall Goldblum to bear.
One week following a tough loss to Georgetown University, the American University Lacrosse team fell 17-9 to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
Vinall scored a minute and 17 seconds into the game, but it was all downhill from there for AU. Once the Retrievers tied the game at 1-1, the Eagles never held another lead.
“We are continuing to make mistakes, and I think they’re not caused by the other team, I think they’re mistakes on our own play,” head coach Lindsay Teeters said. “We’ve got to find a way to keep our composure, to work through and make some minor adjustments within our own individual play, and I think the rest of the pieces will fall into place.”
The severity of this 17-9 trouncing worsens on the stat sheet. The only statistical categories in which AU bested UMBC were draw controls – which Vinall dominated – and turnovers, where the Eagles recorded 17 to the Retrievers’ 20.
Other than holding close with 14 ground balls to UMBC’s 17, AU was crushed by UMBC in every other major statistical category. The Eagles scored eight fewer goals than the Retrievers on six more shots, including shooting just 1-for-5 on free-position shots to the Retrievers’ 4-for-7. 
The Retrievers also faced almost no opposition once the ball left their sticks and headed for the goal. The Eagles’ goalkeepers blocked just five total shots the entire game, resulting in a 29 percent save percentage.
On the opposite end, the UMBC goalkeeper was a brick wall, blocking 15 shots and often completely shutting down the AU offense, even after the rest of the defense had been burned by Vinall’s crafty cutting.
Other than Vinall and Goldblum, only senior Stephanie Walsh scored for the Eagles, prompting coach Teeters to acknowledge the team’s one-dimensional offense.
“Emma Vinall and Kendall Goldblum certainly feel the weight of this team on their shoulders,” Teeters admitted after the game.
However, AU has substantially improved in the games following the UMBC routing, as they squeaked out a tight 15-14 victory over George Mason, followed by a 16-3 dismantling of Howard.
The Eagles will make the quick trip to face George Washington on Wednesday, Mar. 2 and then will return to Jacobs to square off against Gardner-Webb March 5 at 3 p.m.

The American University women’s basketball team extended their win streak to two games after defeating the Lehigh Mountain Hawks at Bender Arena 61-52 Feb. 23. 
Sophomore Riley DeRubbo and senior Jade Edwards led the Eagles with a combined 21 points. 
“Jade can help you in every single way and we needed her to do that today for us to get the win,” head coach Megan Gebbia said after the game. “Riley is just solid, you can rely on her offensively and defensively.”
AU finished as a team shot 38.1 percent from the field and 31.6 percent from beyond the arc. 
Following the opening tip, AU couldn’t establish a rhythm for the first three minutes of the game. The Eagles missed multiple shots, a consistent theme throughout the first quarter of the game.
Senior Emily Fisher got on the board first for the Eagles connecting on a layup. Shortly after, sophomore Ivy Bales followed by making a layup of her own to put AU down 9-4 after four minutes of play. 
Lehigh’s Frannie Hottinger converted on a layup for the Mountain Hawks’ fourth field goal of the game after shooting 4-6 to open the contest. A Bales two-pointer brought AU within seven, despite an ugly start offensively.
Things started to pick up for AU after the Eagles hit on two shots in back-to-back possessions. Lehigh countered with more Hottinger points only for senior Maddie Doring to make a pull-up shot inside the arc, trailing the Mountain Hawks 15-8. 
From there, sophomore Emily Johns began to find her stroke in the latter part of the first half, connecting on back-to-back attempts. Edwards made a pair of free throws after two consecutive layups from the Mountain Hawks to put AU down 28-21 with 2:57 left in the opening half.
Coming out of a timeout, senior Taylor Brown converted on an assist from Bales. Fisher also got in on the action by making her second basket of the game, with Lehigh leading 28-25.
The Eagles cut Lehigh’s lead to one, but Ella Stemmer made a layup to put the Mountain Hawks up 30-27 at the end of the first half.
AU finished the half led by Bales and Fisher combining for 12 points on 33.3 percent shooting from the field. As a team, the Eagles shot 29.4 percent on 10-34 shooting from the field and 8.3 percent from distance. 
Hottinger led the Mountain Hawks, scoring eight points on 40 percent shooting. The Mountain Hawks shot 35.4 percent on 11-31 from the field and a mediocre 20 percent on 2-10 from distance in the first half.
AU opened the second half with a DeRubbo turn-around jumper from behind the arc to put the Eagles down 32-31. Following another Mountain Hawks layup, DeRubbo made another tough shot for her sixth point of the night.

Hottinger converted on her fifth and sixth free throws of the night, only for Doring to make her first three of the night leaving AU down 38-37. 
Brown scored her 4th point of the game off a layup leading to the Mountain Hawks’ first timeout of the half with AU trailing 42-39 with 4:38 left in the quarter.
Following an Edwards layup and another from Johns, the Eagles took their first lead of the night at 43-42. Johns made her third bucket of the game, then Lehigh went cold after missing multiple shots leading to their second timeout of the half with 1:56 left in the quarter.
Johns came out of the timeout by nailing her fourth basket of the game off an assist from Fisher to put the Eagles up 45-42. The Mountain Hawks countered with a layup of their own, but Fisher responded with her 3rd bucket of the game.

The Eagles scored 10 straight until Hottinger threw in a layup. The Eagles then connected from the field followed up by a layup from Brown for her 6th point of the game which closed out the game for the Eagles.
“We really stayed composed during the second half of the game, we really picked up our energy and that got us going,” DeRubbo said postgame.
Final stats
DeRubbo and Edwards led the Eagles in scoring with 11 and 10 points each. Bales and Johns both scored 10 points as well.
