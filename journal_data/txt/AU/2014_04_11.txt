The WONK campaign is pretty cool. I know this is definitely not a popular opinion, but the concept is creative and has so much potential. The problem is that the campaign is lacking something important – the support of the student body. 
So why is the student body so against the idea of WONK? To me, the main problem is that I’m a student at AU, but I don’t feel like a WONK and I never have. The only time on campus that I see anything related to being a WONK is when I get on a shuttle to leave campus. If none of the students identify as WONKs, how can the University advertise being a home of WONKs? It makes no sense.
Instead of turning our backs on the massive amounts of our tuition money that has gone into this campaign and replacing it with something new, we should make the current students at AU feel like WONKs. The models on the advertisements are all attributed to unique types of WONK, like “The Global WONK,” “Activist WONK” or “The Political WONK,” but I’ve never seen any t-shirts or merchandise with those phrases anywhere on campus. The only thing that comes close is the tiny buttons in Katzen on the second floor, which I’m sure most people don’t even know about. There should be a way of receiving free WONK t-shirts by attending multiple on-campus activities or doing certain extracurriculars. Maybe after heading down to CLEAR (the language lab) for the fifth time, I could get a Language WONK t-shirt. Or once I’ve attended five Kogod events, I could get a Business WONK t-shirt. Or if I show that I’ve had more than one internship while at AU, I could get an Internship WONK t-shirt.
There are countless possibilities! I think the WONK campaign could be fantastic – but first, whoever is running this campaign needs to make sure that the student body is included. Who wants to be told that they’ll be a WONK only to come to campus and realize that all they’ve been told is a lie? That looks even worse for the school – especially when Anderson Cooper, after being named WONK of the Year, comes out and admits that he has no idea what a WONK is, and then a good portion of the student body tears down the campaign publicly as a result.
Also, some advertisements explaining what a WONK really is (other than “it’s KNOW backwards!”) might be useful. Most people don’t know that it’s an actual word and means “a person who knows a lot about the details of a particular field.”
There is still a chance of salvaging the WONK campaign if we do it from the inside out.

The Department of Performing Arts dance department presents “Agile, Mobile, Tactile” on Apr. 11-12
The theme for this year’s showcase is about the changing structure of the dance department. The choreographers on staff built their segments around different types of modern dance. 
Melanie George, director of the dance program at AU, worked on the show for over a year. Visiting choreographers, Nicole Wolcott (a choreographer with the company KEIGWIN COMPANY) and Eun Jung Choi (co-director of the duet repertoire theatre of Da Da Dance project) helped students plan their individual segments.  
“Our concert titles always are always designed to represent the commonalities amongst the different dances and also to serve as a metaphor for the current state of the dance program,” George said. 
The yearly showcase is structured into two acts with four dances in the first and three in the second. The dances took several weeks to perfect with large time commitments devoted to each segment.
“All the works were newly created for these dancers; they are integral to the creative process.” George said.
Planning for new dance recitals begins as soon as every year ends. 
“It takes a year to bring this dance concert to the stage, with the bulk of the work occurring during spring semester,” George said. 
George is hopeful that the dance department will be able to grow and find new avenues for their creativity.
“Dance is one of the most immediate of all the art forms,” George said. “It never occurs the same way twice. That makes it unique and valuable.” 
“Agile, Mobile, Tactile” will be staged at the Harold and Sylvia Greenberg Theatre on Apr. 11-12. Both performances from 8 to 10 p.m. RSVP is required.

Bender Arena was filled with an upbeat crowd on April 10, as the Student Union Board (SUB) and WVAU teamed up to bring Chicago artist Chance the Rapper for their final show of the school year.
At the start of the concert, student musical group Divided by Zero helped get the night going. As Divided by Zero played, the crowd began to slowly shuffle and move to the combination of hip-hop tracks mixed with synthesized guitar riffs. Later on, AU student and rapper LYRX joined Divided by Zero to open for Chance the Rapper. The two performed several songs together, but just as they started to get the crowd’s attention, they were suddenly cut off early due to tight scheduling. As the performers left the stage in grief, the arena’s lights blacked out. 
After minutes of setting up and crowd chanting, Chance the Rapper jumped onto the stage. The arena began to light up as Chance performed songs from his latest album, “Acid Rap.” 
On stage, Chance looked like a wound-up Tinkertoy, as he jumped and danced in between the band and his audience. While Chance broke into favorites such as “Cocoa Butter Kisses,” “Interlude” and “Chain Smoker,” his band Social Experiment subdued the audience into an acid jazz frenzy. Unheard on Chance’s studio albums, Social Experiment was able take studio tracks and spaz them out, making the songs sound more spontaneous. The jazz influence on Chance’s set, filled with fast pace drumbeats and loud trumpet solos, gave the audience a different take on many of the songs on “Acid Rap.”
Along with his band, Chance put on an astonishing SUB and WVAU collaborative show. Students screamed Chance’s lyrics and danced to his music as Bender Arena was transformed into a legitimate D.C. music venue. All around, there were beaming grins of happiness.
Full Disclosure: Zach Ewell is a member of WVAU.
