Valentina Fernández, student trustee, Neil Kerwin, former University president, and Shyheim Snead, former student trustee. 
Rising junior Valentina Fernández is sitting in a conference room inside the President’s Office Building, awaiting the next Board of Trustees meeting. Although she is surrounded by influential university donors and decision makers, she doesn’t shy away from sharing her ideas and upholds herself with the professionalism she learned from being a student government senator.
As the first Latinx student trustee, Fernández is determined to make her voice heard on behalf of the student body.
“I couldn’t believe that I got the position, honestly,” Fernández said. “I knew it was something I wanted and felt prepared, but there was still that sense of, ‘Am I qualified enough to do this?’”
Fernández is the first Latinx student trustee on the University’s board of trustees, a position she assumed on May 18. She brings to the role stints as vice president of AU College Democrats and financial services director under former SG President Devontae Torriente, and plans to bring new insight into the role from her previous experience in AUSG and AU College Democrats.
She decided to get involved with the Board of Trustees last year after she reached out to Shyheim Snead, the previous student trustee. He told her about his experiences on the Board, such as interviewing candidates for the 15th University president and educating the campus on how the Board of Trustees functions. 
Fernández soon realized that their interests aligned and she felt that this position would be a perfect fit for her.
“The more I thought about it, the more I realized that this is the place for me,” Fernández said. “I think it was a good way to combine my knowledge of campus culture and my involvement that I had learned from other leadership roles into helping the university in the long term.”
Snead then became Fernández’s mentor, teaching her about how the University functions and watching board meetings on the major issues that the AU community faces. Serving a student trustee is a two-year commitment: Fernández spent the past year shadowing Snead before assuming the role herself on May 18. 
Fernández said his influence set the standard for how to behave on the Board and how to speak with eloquence on behalf of students.  He also showed her that the position is much different from a student government role in that although she speaks on behalf of students, she also has to think about the University’s best interests from the administration’s perspective.
Snead said he was fortunate to have mentored Fernández and appreciated her hard work and dedication. 
“Valentina brought with her a host of on campus experiences and connections that have informed her views and will undoubtedly serve her well in the boardroom,” Snead said in an email.
Upon becoming student trustee, Fernández said she worried that she wasn’t qualified enough to work with the influential alumni, donors and CEOs on the Board, but to her surprise, they made her feel welcome and took her ideas seriously. 
“I think that once I stepped foot into the position, I was really overwhelmed but surprised at the same time because I think it was the first time that I was exposed to a room of that many influential people,” Fernández said.
As student trustee, she plans to facilitate more discussions between students and the Board. She believes that by using social media to promote Board activities, hosting coffee talks with student leaders and notifying students when trustees are on campus, she can make the position more transparent and increase communication between students and the administration.
“I think there’s a big disconnect about what students think the Board is doing and what the Board thinks students are doing, and that’s where a bunch of miscommunication happens,” Fernández said. “I think when students have someone that represents them on the Board, they are more willing to listen to what’s going on and understand how things are being broken down.”
As the first Latinx person to assume the position, Fernández plans to contribute ideas from her personal experiences to the Board. Fernández said race has become the largest issue on campus, following a series of racist incidents targeting black women last September and again in May.
She believes that it is her responsibility to offer new ideas that would not have been included if she wasn’t a Latinx person. 
“When my identity comes into play, what can I contribute to the conversations that are happening?” Fernández said. “When can I speak up, especially when it comes to conversations on race?”
Snead, who is African-American, is confident that Fernández will represent her community while heightening the accessibility of the role.
“It is my hope and confidence that she will work to strengthen the bridge between students and the Board of Trustees, both in terms of transparency, information and accessibility,” Snead said.

Merriweather Post Pavilion’s 50th anniversary concert is slated to feature Willie Nelson, Jackson Browne, Father John Misty and special guest host Grace Potter. Nelson, who played during the 40th anniversary year, first debuted at the Columbia, Maryland venue back in 1978, appearing with then President Jimmy Carter.
Originally designed by award-winning architect Frank Gehry, the iconic venue has borne witness to countless legendary acts at the height of their fame, from the Beach Boys to Cher. Singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett, known for his hit song “Margaritaville,” has performed at the venue more than any other act, appearing a staggering 47 times, according to the Pavilion.
Baltimore psych-rock band Animal Collective named their critically acclaimed 2009 album after the venue, a true testament to the power the Pavilion holds in the music industry, and in the Baltimore region.
The amphitheater isn’t limping into their 50th year, however. It has undergone extensive renovations in recent years and continues to improve the attendee experience by offering world class lineups and revamped concessions.
As a Maryland native for nearly 17 years, the venue holds a special place in my heart. I have seen some of my favorite acts there: Kendrick Lamar, Queens of the Stone Age, Tame Impala and Jack White, and continue to be a firm believer of the magic that happens on venue grounds.
While the Pavilion has a lot to look forward to, here’s a look back at some of the great all time acts that have graced the stage across the decades:
Tickets for the July 15 show are available here. Doors are at 4:30 p.m. and the show starts at 6:00 p.m.

Correction appended: The original story stated that artist Willie Nelson "was a headliner at the 40th anniversary show" for the Merriweather Post Pavilion. It has been updated to say Nelson "played during the 40th anniversary year."

With field hockey season rapidly approaching, the Eagles are sticking to their time-tested summer workouts with the goal of improved performance come fall. 
For the past two summers, head coach Steve Jennings and his staff have given each athlete two individual training packets, one for running and one for lifting. However, players say this year’s workouts are increased in intensity and length.
“Summer is all about getting stronger and faster,” junior defender Rachel Stefano said. 
The lifting packet is arranged differently for each individual athlete based on the weights she was recorded lifting in the spring. The 2017 packets require five workouts per week, a more demanding workload than previous offseasons, senior midfielder Samantha McCormick said. 
“The running packet is almost the same for all of us, the difference being the rest time between runs,” Stefano said.  “Incoming freshmen have a slightly tweaked packet to help them acclimate to the runs we do instead of throwing them right into it.”
In total, the athletes should be lifting, playing a pickup game twice a week, and participating in a team practice once a week. 
They’re strongly encouraged to play in summer leagues during the warm weather months to prepare their bodies for the season. Many team members go home for the summer and participate in summer leagues that practice near their homes. High Performance, a field hockey summer program geared toward college athletes, has locations all around the U.S. Eagles who utilize High Performance camps pick the site closest to their homes to train. International students join summer club teams in their home countries.
“The rigorous training schedule [both in-season and pre-season] that we have been using the past few years has worked well,” Jennings said. When they stick to the packets given to them for the summer, they are sure to see success when they come back for the season in the fall.” 
The packets given to the team by Jennings, though, are written to be used outside of set practice times with summer league teams. Stefano chooses to come to her summer league’s practices early to complete her runs, while her training days are utilized for lifting. 
“The first two weeks of the summer were the most intense for me because I haven’t been training every single day [since the regular season],” Stefano said. “I’m sure the rest of the girls could say the same.”
Jennings’s training template has been in place for the past two seasons. The hope is for each athlete to follow her packet exactly over the summer to get in the best pre-season shape possible.
“The coaches put as much as possible in the players’ hands to lead them where they want to go,” Jennings said.  
The offseason training has paid dividends for the Eagles. AU has reached the Patriot League Tournament final each of the past two seasons. In 2016, the Eagles claimed their tenth conference title under Jennings. AU finished the year ranked 19th with high expectations for 2017. 
The Eagles open their 2017 season on the road against the University of Richmond on August 25.

Swiss director Frédéric Mermoud’s second feature film, “Moka,” follows the story of Diane (Emmanuelle Devos) who is struggling with the death of her only son in a hit and run accident. Diane is stricken with grief and anger as the police seem to be unable to find the killers, taking the case into her own hands by hiring a detective. She tracks a couple matching the description and infiltrates their lives to find hard evidence, subjecting them to the same pain that she is filled with. The film’s main question, “what does revenge mean?” gets over asked. What can Diane hope to accomplish by finding her son’s killers? What will it really change? Not once is there an actual answer.
The francophone film is a contemporary realist exploration of Diane’s pain as well as a dark and twisted thriller. The movie emphasizes its realism using a minimal soundtrack, often even using no soundtrack at all. Realistic dialogue and a combination of handheld and steady camera to give the viewer a uniquely personal point of view. The viewer is meant to constantly be next to Diane, having the story be revealed to both at the same time. 
It’s not surprising that the mother figure loses her child, and thus plays into the more stereotypical aspects of the revenge trope. While there are some moments that are compelling and delve into Diane and surrounding characters, the film is mainly controlled by a trite story. 
The few moments showing Diane’s thoughts and motives are what make this movie interesting. Sadly, a few fantastic moments do not make a good film. The rest of the film is mostly Diane speaking to the suspected couple and acting awkward and anxious. While a realist film, it includes unrealistic characters or actions. 
If you have a keen interest in foreign or realist films, “Moka” could be a fun flick, but this is definitely not a movie for everybody. The few moments of intensity and suspense are not worth watching the entire film. 
Rating: B-
Moka opened in theaters on July 7.
