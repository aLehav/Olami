The Eagles failed to start their conference play with a win, losing their Patriot League opener to Bucknell 57-47 in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.
The Eagles out-rebounded by Bucknell 35-23, and their struggles under the hoop stood as a key factor in the loss. Twelve of the rebounds were on the offensive end, which led to 12 second-chance points. The Bison also outscored AU in the paint, 26-18.
The loss was AU’s first loss in a Patriot League opener in five years.
"Bucknell is a tough team and they showed that today,” said head coach Mike Brennan, according toa press release. “They are really good at what the do and really executed. We didn't play to the level we needed to in order to win."
The Eagles shot 53 percent from the field in the first 10 minutes, but they failed to maintain their success. They shot seven out of 21 from the field and two out of nine from behind the three-point line in the second half.
AU jumped out to a 12-7 lead, but they quickly ran into foul trouble. Senior guard Pee Wee Gardner, junior center Zach Elcano, and junior forward Marko Vasic each racked up two fouls in the first half, allowing Bucknell to gain momentum. The Bison tied the game before halftime, and the Eagles never managed to re-exert their dominance in the game.
The Eagles were led by sophomore forward Charlie Jones, who scored 17 points and hit a career high of three three-pointers. Junior guard Jesse Reed also had a strong showing, scoring 12 points and 7 rebounds.

After falling behind early and trailing nearly the entire first half, AU found their momentum late in the game to roar back to a 74-63 victory over Holy Cross on Jan. 3 in Worcester, Massachusetts.
Senior guard Jen Dumiak and junior forward Michelle Holmes spurred the late comeback and led the Eagles with double digit points. Dumiak poured in 21 points for the Eagles, scoring at least 20 points for the fourth consecutive game. She added 11 assists and six rebounds while Holmes contributed 20 points, three rebounds and three steals.
Senior forward Arron Zimmerman also added 10 points and eight rebounds, and senior guard Shaquila Curtis notched 10 points for the Eagles (7-6, 2-0 PL). The Eagles scored 52 of their 74 points in the second half, and the surge allowed them to overcome the Crusaders (5-10, 1-1 PL).
Plagued by poor shooting and turnovers in the first half, AU fell behind 13-4 to the Crusaders early in the game. The Eagles struggled to chip away at the Crusaders’ lead, but a pair of free throws from Dumiak cut the lead to three with 3:05 left in the first half. Holy Cross responded with a 7-0 run to close the half, and AU trailed at the break 31-22.
Dumiak and Holmes made two baskets each during a 10-2 AU run to start the second half that cut the Crusaders’ lead to one. However, the Eagles struggled to match the Holy Cross offensive duo of junior guard Lisa Misfud and junior forward Raquel Scott, and the Crusaders built a 49-40 lead with 10:32 remaining in the game. AU again mounted a comeback, and 10 straight points by Holmes finally gave the Eagles the lead 59-57 with 4:37 left in the second half. Strong defense and free-throw shooting down the stretch allowed AU to hold on for their second straight road victory to start the Patriot League season.
Despite early troubles with turnovers, AU recovered in the second half and recorded only eight total turnovers for the game, the second consecutive game the Eagles have had single-digit turnovers. AU forced the Crusaders into 16 turnovers and held Holy Cross to a shooting percentage from the field of 45.8 percent. AU shot only 29.6 percent from the field in the first half, but they shot an impressive 64.3 percent from the field during the second half.
