The first No Lost Generation gala held to raise money and awareness for refugees. The club is hosting their second annual gala this Saturday.
No Lost Generation held its inaugural gala to raise money and awareness for refugees on April 1 in the School of International Service, which included former Ambassador to Zambia Mark C. Storella as a distinguished guest. Storella is the deputy assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.
No Lost Generation is a collaborative network of college organizations that seeks to support refugees. This student initiative has expanded to include chapters at 50 colleges and universities since its founding in 2015 at George Washington University. 
AU formed a chapter this year filled with students who have advanced No Lost Generation’s mission on campus. This includes a a rally in support of immigration rights that the group held in February. 
Shayna Vayser and Andrew Rogan are the student co-executive directors of the AU chapter of No Lost Generation. 
“There are a few things we are trying to do to engage more with the refugee community as a result of this gala,” Vayser said. “We want to promote engagement at every level, and we also want to raise money for the cause, which we are donating to the United Nations program Adopt-A-Future.” 
Adopt-A-Future works to educate a new generation of refugee children and was the recipient of all proceeds from gala ticket sales.
Rogan said the Adopt-A-Future campaign is unique because all of the money raised goes directly to two refugee camps in Kenya, in the towns of Kakuma and Dadaab. 
“The reason this gala is so important is because it promotes these provisions of actual guidance and materials which can permanently impact and improve refugee lives,” Rogan said. 
Rogan also detailed additional plans that the club has for the future.  
“A number of future initiatives are going to begin in promotion of more fundraising and more engagement with the community to advocate for refugees,” Rogan said. “In the upcoming fall semester specifically, students will have an opportunity to join a panel committee and a funding committee that will work with the No Lost Generation.”
The gala was packed with over one hundred people buzzing around networking with each other and appreciating the music, food and art. One of the most exciting parts of the event was when Associate Dean for Curriculum and Learning in the School of International Service Rose Shinko introduced Ambassador Mark Storella as the night’s keynote speaker. 
Shinko is currently the deputy assistant secretary for the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration. He has a longstanding commitment to humanitarian affairs and human rights.
“All the folks who have been organizing this, I want to tell you that I am thoroughly excited to join you tonight,” Storella said at the beginning of his speech. “You are brought together because you care about humanitarian affairs and you are very right to.”
Storella continued by telling the story of his first engagement in refugee affairs which began during his education when he saw a sign looking for people to help Vietnamese refugees. He was inspired to commit to this cause after seeing how much help he could provide to a family which he assisted in finding jobs, getting driver's licenses and becoming accustomed to American life. 
“The refugee issue is going to be a defining challenge of your lives,” he told the crowd. “It has affected politics on a world stage and is going to get even more important.” 
Speaking on the causes of the refugee crisis, he said “Conflict is now the biggest drive of refugee migration, but with increasing environmental challenges, the crisis will be heightened because as resources become more scarce, conflict becomes even more common.”
The quality of the lives of refugees are of great concern to Storella, he noted solemnly.
“Refugees are subjected to being captured, they are subjected to being enslaved, and they are subject to being murdered,” he said.  
However, Storella still had an optimistic outlook on the future, ending his address by encouraging students to get involved in refugee rights.
“What we have to do is to get all the countries in the world to dedicate themselves to helping refugees and the permanently displaced,” he said. “What I hope you recognize, is the you are a part of a movement.”

Indie rock group Big Thief played its latest album, “Masterpiece,” to a sold out crowd in the basement of Songbyrd Music House on March 25. 
Rocking a riot crew cut and her raspy voice, frontwoman Adrianne Lenker brought the show down. Her ability to bring a crowd to cheers and utter silence in the same ten minutes is astounding. With a relatively short set that only lasted an hour, Lenker opened with a few solo pieces, then the rest of Big Thief, Buck Meek on guitar, Max Oleartchik on bass and James Krivchenia on drums, joined. 
The band’s greatest numbers of the night were “Masterpiece” and “Real Love.” While Lenker’s softer pieces like “Paul” and “Velvet Ring” are astoundingly beautiful in their emotional storytelling, Meek and Krivchenia’s power and sound are incredible in these quicker tunes. 
The band just announced its second record, “Capacity,” which will be released on June 9, produced by Andrew Sarlo and distributed by Saddle Creek Records. Big Thief’s new single “Mythological Beauty,” is about the time when Lenker was five and the treehouse her family was building collapsed on her, nearly killing her. The song is written from her mother’s perspective of rushing to the hospital after the accident, Lenker said in a recent interview with Pitchfork.
Big Thief will return to Songbyrd Music House on April 27, presented by WRGW.

Musician and actor Common speaks to American University students at Bender Arena.  
For the Kennedy Political Union’s last event of the year, rapper and actor Lonnie “Common” Lynn, spoke at an event in Bender Arena on April 5.
The College of Arts and Sciences, along with other organizations including the Alumni Association, Office of Campus Life, WVAU and the Black Student Alliance co-sponsored the event. Common addressed students and then sat down for a question and answer session with Sean Glover, a manager in the music industry, and AU audio technology professor Michael Harvey. 
He was introduced by Aaliyah Lambert, deputy director of logistics management for KPU. Lambert said Common “breaks new ground” in the work he does in the music industry and for social justice causes. 
The rapper said his career all started with hip-hop when he and his cousin would come up with raps as kids, which is how he started his night in Bender Arena. Common entertained the crowd with rhymes related to AU, referencing Mass Ave., the Dav and Anderson Hall.
“I’ve got to start this over with American University with a freestyle real quick,” Common said. “Yo, yo you know the path, they said maybe I should get some coffee at the Dav.”
After he shared his talents, Common invoked the Muhammed Ali theory into his speech. He said the premise of this concept is that Ali was known all around the world for being the best, not because of his skills in the ring, but because at the height of his career he stood up for what he felt was right by not fighting in the Vietnam War. Ali also welcomed all of those he met despite their appearance or background. Common then shared with the crowd what they needed to do in order to achieve their own greatness.
“I didn’t know how to get to this greatness. So I thought about it,” Common said. “I came up with the anecdote: find your path, believe in your path, live your path.”
Common then told the story of when he knew hip-hop was his passion. While in college studying business, he knew it wasn’t for him and had to tell his mother that he wanted to pursue music. He was so steadfast in his choice that any backlash he received was not going to stop him. 
He said that his belief in himself is what allowed him to achieve his greatness. A man of many talents, acting, film production, writing and activism, Common is working toward becoming the greatest, he said. 
“Believing in your path is believing in yourself,” Common said. “Belief is contagious.” 
Common addressed his role in social justice as well.
“Where we are in society, when we look at this world right now and see what’s going on and we aren’t happy with what’s been going on politically, we know that this is a challenge,” Common said. “Challenges are the things that bring out the best in us. When you are on your path to greatness, that’s what determines who are the greats.” 
Common also created the Common Ground Foundation which, according to its site, aims “to empower high school students to become future leaders through programs focused on character development, healthy living, financial literacy and creative expression.”
After the event, audience members such as Miracle Smith, a freshman in the School of Public Affairs, expressed their enthusiasm.
“I really enjoyed tonight,” Smith said. “I didn’t know he was so passionate.” 
Valentina Muraleedharan, a graduate student in the School of International Service, also commented on what Common had to say to the crowd. 
“I think it’s really important that someone with influence uses it to bring about change,” she said. “I think his speech was well thought out and intentional. His rhetorical stance was not just about what is wrong but what we can do to change it.”
