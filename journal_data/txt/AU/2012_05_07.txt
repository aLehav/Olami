Editor's Note: This summer, starting today, Eagle Rants will be posted only every Monday. Also, we have switched Eagle Rants editor as of today.



•@AU Vigilante: You're a little late to the party, dude.  But welcome.  Don't wear a cape; being a super hero isn't about you, it's about the people you're protecting.
•If Sarah McBride is not a public figure then you shouldn't be posting positive rants about her either.  No rants that identify non-public figures remember?  So post 'em all or none at all.
•I want to study abroad, but I have a feeling the women won't take kindly to the close examination. Ha, Drum hit. Badum Tish!
•@"I'm scared to let you go. But I'm also scared to let you in."
Let him/her in.  Life is easier when you have someone to share it with.
•@ " I'm not ashamed to be excited to go home and hang out with my parents on Friday and Saturday nights"
I give you a week before you snap.
•OP of roommate transferring- I know, I can't tell her how upset I am because I want her to go where she is happy so it's a really difficult position.. she leaves tomorrow and I still haven't said anything.. sigh
•my roommate has stopped doing laundry, she is just spraying her shirts with a perfume mixture now.
•@""The "call me maybe" video, yeah, was that filmed on campus?" Are you stupid? No."- clearly someone doesnt get the humor in this. the original ranter was implying that the scenario which takes place (hot guy who turns out to be gay) is very reminiscent of an AU situation
•@"animal- free food is often cheaper and provides something that everyone can enjoy." mmhmm cuz TDR's tempeh is just soooo delicious... uh, NOT. Spoiler, not everyone enjoys squished soy cubes. We evolved to have our taste buds enjoy meat because it gives us the protein and salt we need. TDR is the reason I STOPPED being vegan. Ick.
•@Wish I could just have a hook up... Hey, I'm in the same boat. It seems as tho the men-folk really have  only school on the brain... FOR LIKE THE FIRST TIME EVER!
•I miss my dog, but I'm not going home this summer.. Waaaaahhh
•It's three in the morn' and I'm lookin' for the porn.
•Either the editor didn't post my rant, or I just forgot to submit it. Probably the latter, but I'm not sure. I was pretty sleep-deprived.
•Went to a Nats game this weekend, watched the WONK campaign evaporate my tuition dollars before my eyes. Seriously, what kind of self-respecting university advertises themselves that much at a ballpark? WONK needs to burn in hell.
•Gender identity disorder is the formal psychological term for those who are transgender/transsexual. It will be called gender dysphoria in the DSM-5, and will still cover these topics. Personally, I do not believe it should be considered a "disorder", the same way homosexuality isn't considered a disorder (though it used to be), but there are certain benefits with it being a diagnosable disorder, including that insurance companies will cover things like gender reassignment surgery. There's debate about the topic among psychologists and just people in general.
•@why am i so lonely?
I used to feel that way until I found God and rediscovered  my faith in Jesus Christ.  God made you in his own image.  He will never leave you alone.
•@girlfriend needs to grow up: Instead of criticizing her, try explaining logically what  she did and how it negatively affected you. Speak in terms of “I feel x and y”, rather than “you always do x and y”. If you accuse of things she will be less likely to listen to you. Positive affirmation is always better at changing behavior than negative affirmation. I recommend the book “The Truth About Love” by Dr. Patricia Love PhD for more relationship tips.
•I also thought the werewolf rant was some twilight reference. Now I looked it up on wikipedia and saw that it is a real thing. To answer your question seriously OP, yes AU is very accepting of all types of conditions and lifestyles. You will love it here. Hope to see you next year!
•I like it when u call me big pa-pa.
•You laugh at my dreams and you don't accept my life goals. It really upsets me and makes me feel less valued.
•@way out of control promotion of “sexual assault awareness” ranter: I completely agree. Whenever I have friends visit me at AU, they think AU is a college full of rapists. AU probably has a much much lower rate of date rape that most of other colleges in the country (for one, because so much of the population is gay). The whole overdramatization of the rape awareness campaigns are actually hurting real victims by making AU look stupid and by turning the whole issue of date rape into a cry wolf situation.
•Why does no one reply to the Gary Johnson rants? Ron Paul gets some love. Come on now. There is no way I am the only Gary Johnson supporter at AU. He embodies the best of both parties. Fiscal responsibility from the republicans and civil liberties and equality from the democrats. Gary Johnson 2012!
•Woah, woah, woah. Someone is dating their big??? WTF??? That is the worst greek incest.
•@Editor- So if I publish an op-ed saying that I'm very secure in my gender, and my personal opinion is that there are psychological explanations behind gender identity disorder, are you going to censor the rants disagreeing with me? What Sarah did is beautiful, and brave, and I'm happy for her, but I think that those who had issues with her op-ed deserve to be heard the same way she got an opportunity to be heard. Don't encourage an atmosphere of division here by only publishing one side.
•I know Sarah, and she's been wonderful and receptive to answering people's questions about her transition. Eagle Rants is an excellent platform for people who don't know her, and have confusions. If you don't publish the negative (but not hateful...) rants, these people who don't know anything about transgendered people won't have the opportunity to have other people answer and respond. You're basically facilitating ignorance about this... I'm really disappointed in the Eagle.
•the editor just answering nope= complete BS.. you know you're wrong, McBride gave up the privacy by posting the article and just replying with nope is a cop out because you know you should've posted those rants
•Are you sad to see the editor of Eagle rants go?
[Ranter's note: Nope.]
•Sarah McBride is a private figure who you can't negatively comment on.
[Ranter's note: Nope.]
•I don't think the issue of on campus food is about the variety of food... it's more about the price. There is a ridiculous  mark up on everything on campus. My bank account can't handle it!
•On my to do list I made last night for the rest of finals, I've only been able to cross one thing off so far. This is not good.
•I think it's wonderful that Sarah was able to come out to a very accepting environment and I am very proud of her decision. However, if you're going to uphold her status as a non-public figure don't publish ANY rants about her.
•OK, I can understand the Student Union being upset about the fact that students have no say with regards to raising tuition and what's going into the McDonald's, but I really don't have sympathy re: being a dry campus. That's been a policy for a loooong time; you should've known that when you signed on.
•The idea of the unpaid internship is a completely immoral concept and a violation of labor laws. AU (and all other colleges) need to stop encouraging immoral corporations to take advantage of desperate students and needs to stop giving "college credit" for "internships". College is for learning. Not for paying 3k to AU in order to work for free as an envelop licker.
•As a redhead, I'm so sick of the word "ginger." Ugh.
•I once had to fart really badly in a literature class. So, ladies, I am single and available. #realtalk
•From NYT : “When I lived in D.C., it astounded me that the nation's best and brightest college students, hoping to go into politics, worked for senators and congressmen unpaid. Not only was this surprising because of the amount of work D.C. interns actually did on the Hill, but also because it meant that only the wealthier college students could afford to work these unpaid "jobs" and, therefore, meet the people and get the experiences that would be integral if they chose to continue on in politics. And we wonder why our politicians tend to come from the "1 percent."”
•Did anyone else read the New York Times article “The Outsources Life” about how we are outsourcing intimacy in the form of hiring therapists/life coaches/wantologists because we view sharing our problems with friends as burdening them? When did we become too busy to care for others? Thoughts?
•@Person ranting about Sarah McBride's Op/Ed, she wrote that to appropriately explain, as outgoing president, what was happening.  The AU community deserved an explanation about this public figure.  She did not write it to be criticized for her feelings and decisions.  And what do you care if she did or not?  It's her life, not yours.
•@"AU really isn't vegan-friendly at all...." FALSE. We were ranked 10th this year. Check yo self.
•I made the best rants of the year TWICE and I am embarrassingly proud.
[Editor’s Note: Kudos!]
•Dear one girl sitting with all of AEPi in the library: I don't know what weird, deep psychological need you're trying to fulfill, but you just look pathetic and you're not cute. P.S., everyone is annoyed by how loud you guys are being.
•If you whine about not getting a place to replace McDonalds look no further than the fanatical green movement on this campus. The reason no company took the lease is because there is a clause for carbon neutrality. Do not let the eagle article trick you into thinking companies pulled out do to a lack of interest from corporate. It is due to these idiotic green eagles that we can not have a normal place to eat at on our campus.
•@Editor: Ohhh editor, let us call a spade a spade and admit. You like Sarah or support the situation they are going through so you are avoiding dissident press. I have no qualms with it but do not postulate you are doing it for some moral inclination, being her privacy. Coming out like that was no private matter and you have not posted rants that did not even attack Sarah but rather ask provocative questions about trans sexuality. Just admit it.
•All I seem to be doing lately is playing with fire.
•@Person who asked a question about a cow: You shouldn't get spoiled milk, you'll be buttering it up if you do it right.
•@Hate -I probably am a terrible person. I would still like to have a discussion in person so we can end the year like the friends we once were.
•Has anyone ever told you that you're a passive-aggressive low life? It's no wonder you have a whopping two friends here. Have fun abroad because I never want to see you again after what you've said. La chatte!
•Amie Krupnick? YOU BET.
•I have three roomates. I love two of them dearly but we all hate the third one. How can we convince her to move ouuuut?
•Go SG!
•Im thankful for the blog.
•Fun fact. Racism is still funny.
•As a woman, I'm all for gender equality, but do you think next year Women's Initiative we can tone it down a bit? My grandmother came to pick me up and I'm trying to explain to her I don't go to a school of rapists. If she passes out....
•I am so grateful for your blog post.Much thanks again. Want more.
•The myAU Portal is totally broken right now. Great. It's not like I need to see what my grades are or anything.
•I had too much sex this semester.
•I don't know how to tell you how much your friendship has meant to me this year. It's too important to do it over text message, and if I say it in person I might end up hugging you and crying, even though I am neither a hugger nor a cry-er. Thanks for putting up with my brattiness, and for helping me get swoll.
•Impeach the Eagle Rants Editor!
•I missed puppy day :(
•Hey Eagle Rants editor, if I make an inappropriate comment toward some random transgender person without mentioning a specific name, will you still censor me? What if this person doesn't even exist? And what if my comment is not geared toward all transgender people, but just this one person who I won't name? Will you still censor me then?
[Editor’s Note: The Eagle does not publish hate speech, so probably not.]
•Seeing as how The Eagle keeps censoring Sarah rants, I say we need  another Free Speech wall so that all expressions can be heard without fear of censorship.
•Thank you ever so for you article.Thanks Again.
•I asked you to do ONE thing, and I gave you plenty of time to do it, and you didn't. You suck.
•Where are the May 7th eagle rants???
[Editor’s Note: Editor’s got finals, too, you know.]
•@ @Women's Initiative (who stated a prospective student was worried if sexual assault was an issue on the campus), If statistics such as 1 in 4 were lower, there would be no need for the programming. Stop sexual assault, not the prevention.
