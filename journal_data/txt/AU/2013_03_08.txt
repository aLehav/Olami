•You know what sucks? What sucks is having no friends, not being good at anything, and realizing that your life is so, so far off from where you wanted it to be. 
•wake me up you stinking varmint. don't leave me hanging out like an injun

•overalls anyone?
•I saw this one guy who I went on a kind-of date with freshman year (we're now seniors) the other day, for the first time since 2010. He is certifiably HOT. Damn.
•@'•Just because you wear leggings as pants doesn't mean you should. #TERRIBLEFASHIONSENSE. Also they're not pants. They're really not. If I can see every outline of your underwear, they're not pants. Seriously, at that point, why not just go around in your underwear?' Hmm.. well it's gonna start getting warmer soon.. why not?
•@'@ @Nothing is more frustrating than getting comfy in the library and then realizing there's no plug near you.' worst. thing. ever.
The worst thing ever? Worse than the Holocaust? Really? Be thankful for what you have idiot.' 
First of all, learn to take a joke. Absolutely NOBODY thinks it's worse than the Holocaust, I mean Jesus Christ, man, are you kidding? Second, I lost a lot of family in the Holocaust so yeah, I'm fully aware of how awful it was. Third, get a hobby instead of dampening down people's annoyances.
•Eww, what's the point of even posting pictures on instagram when you take them blurry and crooked?! If you're gonna be a sheep, at least be an artsy one...
•EVERYBODY CALM DOWN THIS IS EAGLE RANTS NOT 'LET ME TELL YOU WHY YOU'RE A JERK AND I'M THE RULER OF ALL AND MY OPINION IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS LAND' geez
•Don't you hate it when people greet you with, "I haven't seen you around in forever! ...where have you been?" as if YOU'RE the one whose been isolating yourself in the room. Seriously? I'm around campus just as as much as I was last semester, maybe the question is where have YOU been!  
•I was crushing on a girl all last semester until I came to accept that she was almost certainly straight... Now (through extensive facebook creeping) it looks like she might not be... Looks like I can go back to crushing on her!
•@"The dark haired photolab dude w/ glasses digs u back": Who is the "u" in this lovely sentence?
•@"The worst thing ever? Worse than the Holocaust?": I've found the people who compare things to the Holocaust generally tend to suck. 
•The boy I was crushing on all semester until I got some pretty good feelings that he was straight I'm almost positive that he is gay... Facebook creeping does pay off... Yay! Now I have someone to crush on this semester! 
•I make up rants to make it seem like I have stuff going on in my life...
•AEPhi didn't steal that tradition from Chi O, they took it from Phi Mu. 
•Literally all of the rants from yesterday reaffirmed how happy I am to be going home for spring break. Seriously y'all, was there a full moon or something? This school is just plain weird. 
•@SnoringRoommate
I have the same problem. My roommate is also overweight. He snores super loud. Earplugs. Buy them. I can sleep now.
•@"What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at 3 in the morning?"

•Texas is #1

But an article consisting of a tiramisu recipe is prominent on The Eagle's homepage. Yay priorities! [Editor's Note: That top slot needs a photo for every story. We didn't have a photo for the BOE story. 
•people are seriously angry that animal testing takes place? Honestly people. It sucks that it happens. But id much rather have medicine and vaccines tested on a mice over a human being. There are a lot more important issues in the world. 
•Sandra Fluke at AU #disgusting
•A Feminazi is a hard core feminist, whose harshness and brutishness is equal to that of a Nazi. They blame all of there problems on men, as the source of there continuous "oppression". (ie Seeing the need to wear a bra and shave your legs as a sign of giving into male pressure to be attractive) ... Unfortunately there is a sizable population of these people at AU
