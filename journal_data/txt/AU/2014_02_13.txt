D.C. mayoral candidates who participated in a debate at AU pose for a picture on Feb. 12.
Candidates for D.C. mayor took center stage to discuss issues such as adequate education, job growth and gentrification at a debate at Katzen Arts Center Feb. 12. The event was hosted by the Kennedy Political Union. 
D.C. Councilmembers Jack Evans (Ward 2), Tommy Wells (Ward 6) and Vincent Orange (Ward 5), as well as former State Department special representative and AU alumna Reta Jo Lewis, community activists Andy Shallal and Carlos Allen are vying for the Democratic Party nomination. The election is slated for April 1. 
As the candidates offered their vision for the city’s future, nearly all touched on the failed leadership of incumbent mayor Vincent Gray, who is currently facing allegations of running a “shadow campaign” that illegally funneled money for his 2010 mayoral campaign, according to an ABC report. 
“We’re distracted with so many other issues,” Shallal, the founder of Busboys and Poets, said. “The corruption, the shadow campaign and all these things, it’s really hard to focus on the issue of statehood.” 
Both Gray and Ward 4 Councilmember Muriel Bowser did not show up to the debate. Bowser had a community event and could not attend, a staffer said after the debate. 
Candidates sparred over a marijuana decriminalization bill that would transition possession from a criminal charge to a $25 civil fine for up to an ounce of marijuana while lowering public smoking sentences to just 65 days. 
Wells, who authored the bill, said approximately 90 percent of all marijuana-related arrests are of African-American men, a crime which may hinder their ability to find jobs or housing in the future. 
“Decrim is just the first step,” Wells said. “It’s a smart thing to do, it’s a matter of social justice, and that’s what we need to do.”
Orange said he believes the bill is flawed because it fails to address work drug testing and urged the council to reconsider. 
Evans also pledged his support for decriminalizing possession, but disagreed with Well’s efforts to decriminalize public smoking altogether.
“Most people we talk to just didn’t want to see that happen,” Evans said of public smoking. “I believe decriminalizing marijuana like we did is a step toward legalizing it.” 
Candidates also discussed how to better include college students in the fabric of the city. Both Lewis and Wells supported a loan-forgiveness program that would help retain young talent in the city after graduation.
“If you are out there being the activist you always have been, I want to make sure you have a path to go help our young people, go help our non-profits, go help our elderly,” Lewis said. “We should be assisting you as you assist the citizens of the District of Columbia.” 
As the city balances economic growth and preserving cultural heritage, nearly all candidates agreed that housing prices were too steep and threatened historic communities. The city has veered from its plan to expand affordable housing to tens of thousands of people, Orange said.
“We’re a $12 billion organization, we have $1.7 billion in our rainy day fund, we’re coming off a $320 million surplus, and we project a surplus for the next five years,” Orange said about D.C. government funds. “The money is there, take care and do the job we said that we were going to do.”

Coming off three consecutive conference wins, the AU women’s basketball team extended their winning streak to four with a win over Lehigh in Bethlehem, Pa. on Feb.12 
After trailing at halftime, the Eagles came back and took control of the game in the second half, outscoring Lehigh 43-25 to finish with a final score of 69-56. The victory was a team effort, with four different players scoring in the double digits.  
The Eagles (17-7, 10-3 PL) began the game on a strong note by shutting down the Mountain Hawk offense and holding Lehigh scoreless for the first four and a half minutes.  
However, the Eagles quickly lost control of the game as the Mountain Hawks (11-12, 4-8 PL) pulled ahead, giving Lehigh a 35-26 lead going into the break.
In the second half AU shined, especially in the last five minutes, where two three-point shots by junior forward Arron Zimmerman and a third three-pointer by senior guard Alexis Dobbs. This gave the AU squad a nine point lead with just over three minutes remaining in the game. Zimmerman hit two foul shots to complete a solid AU victory with the score 69-56 Eagles.
Dobbs had a major impact on the game with 19 points and nine rebounds, just one board shot of completing the double-double. Along with Dobbs, Zimmerman led the Eagles in points with 19.
Coming off the bench, junior forward Shaquilla Curtis gave AU a boost with 13 points and six boards. Junior guard Jen Dumiak contributed a team high four assists.  
As a team, the Eagles finished with a shooting percentage of 35 percent, going 21-for-60. Lehigh finished with a shooting percentage of 42 percent, going 19-for-45.
As a whole the Eagles played an aggressive defensive game as well. AU outrebounded Lehigh 39-30. The Mountain Hawks also gave up  21 turnovers, while AU only gave up 12. The Eagles took advantage, scoring 25 points off Lehigh’s turnovers.
With the victory, the Eagles proved that they can win on the road having lost just one game away from Bender Arena during Patriot League play.
The Eagles will face Lafayette at home Feb. 15 and honor four seniors as part of Senior Day.

The Eagles defeated the Lehigh Mountain Hawks 64-44 at Bender Arena on Feb. 12, snapping the team’s two-game losing streak.
“We were down a little bit.” Gardner said of the team after the two game losing streak, “But we knew we had to move on and get ready for Lehigh.”
Junior guard Darius Gardner led the Eagles with 17 points, six assists and five steals. Senior center Tony Wroblicky had a double-double with 15 points and 12 rebounds, also blocking two shots. Sophomore guard Jesse Reed added 14 points and junior John Schoof had twelve points of his own, going 4-5 from beyond the arc.
The Eagles (15-9,11-2 PL) got off to a slow start against Lehigh (13-13 6-7 PL), trailing 18-12 to open the game, but ended the half on a 15-2 run that put AU 27-20 at the break. The momentum continued into the second half as the Eagles stretched their already massive run to 29-7, going up 44-25.
Defending senior guard Mackey McKnight served as an invaluable asset to the Eagles, dubbed as “one of the best players in the league” by Brennan.
“All five guys on the floor knew where he was,”  head coach Mike Brennan said of McKnight. “We were really tuned in to what he was doing, but some guys are going to have off nights.”
McKnight scored 23 points the last time the two teams met in January, but was shut down tonight scoring just six points on 1-5 shooting and turned the ball over six times.
Following two games of uncharacteristically poor defense, the Eagles picked it up defensively, holding Lehigh to just 15-of-43 shooting and forcing 21 turnovers.
“We weren’t doing a really good job on defense the last few games but I felt like we really picked it up.” Wroblicky said of the team’s defensive effort against Lehigh.
After calling a timeout with 8:32 left in the first half, Brennan subbed in walk-on freshman Charlie Jones, who provided a major burst of energy for the Eagles. Despite only scoring two points, Jones sparked both the team and the crowd with his defense and energy, which transpired into a well-executed block to end the first half, eventually receiving a standing ovation from the crowd in the second half for his effort and hustle.
“Since the start of the season, his enthusiasm has brought us energy,” Gardner said of Jones “He’s a great defender, he helps out a lot, and he’s incredibly active.”
The Mountain Hawks were led by freshman guard Austin Price who scored 20 points and had five steals. No other Lehigh player had more than six points.
The Eagles next matchup will be Feb. 15 against the Lafayette Leopards in Easton, Pa. Following this, the Eagles head to Boston to take on the Boston University Terriers for what could be a battle for first in the Patriot League
