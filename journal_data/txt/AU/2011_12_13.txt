•@"To buy a sprite from the Letts vending machines you have to press C4. This amuses me immensely." Why does this amuse you?
•@GodmadeEvolution: saying "God did it" to everything you don't understand isn't a very scientific way to solve the problem... if scientists did that, there would be no progress.
•Really, you want to bring up the creation/evolution debate now, in the eagle rants section?
•My roommate is able to correctly guess which Rants are mine, even when I haven't told her I posted one.  Hi there, by the way.
•The AU Methodists caroling in TDR last night were great! I'm not religious, but you guys sounded really nice :)
•@”Am I the only one whose parents have not paid for any part of my education? Because I honestly feel like I am.” Why didn’t they pay (or help you pay)? Are you mad at them for not paying? – honestly curious

•Why do you keep asking me questions when it's so clear that I'M WRITING SOMETHING? Jesus man it isn't hard to tell that I am focusing on something else.

•@Packers Fan: shayamouf and huyamouf
•Our eyes met and you smiled at me like you knew me. I was walking in on the 3rd floor of the library at about 4pm. Do I know you from somewhere or were you just being polite?
•The MPC is the hottest place on campus by far. Makes for great naked naps.
•"Editor’s note: Are we Facebook friends?" Yes. And if you stop this, I will unleash Hell! Next question
[Editor’s note: This editor is slightly afraid. Threats = scary. Are you a girl?]
•Nice eyebrows are sexy.
•KNOPE 2012
•Person sitting next to me during the exam, I saw you picking your nose and eating the boogers. Just letting you know, we aren't in 5th grade anymore. It's gross.
•@girl who wants to wear old homecoming dresses, ever heard of greek life? crush, semi formal, formal... i'm sure you can get good use out of your dresses and heels.
•sounds like someone's parents are...chintzy
•hey boy. when i ask you to hang out that means that i really like you. catch on!
•I ripped the most expensive jeans I have ever bought today. And I got them on Black Friday. Today rocks.
•I can't think of anything to rant about except that I'm very tired. Like starting to see things that aren't there, tired.
•So I'm going abroad in the spring, and I'm kinda sad that this will be my last weekend in the district coming up. I just want this upcoming weekend to be epic, is that so wrong?
•Dear Salsa -
Would it kill you to have more than two people up here when the line is at ten-plus?
Yours,
Hungry hungry hippo
•Even though I'm excited to go abroad next semester, I'm going to miss AU so much! When I come back I'm going to be a senior and that freaks me outtttt
•I can't wait for you to be back so we can make sandwiches together again.
•There are a bunch of weirdos at phonathon tonight.
•I would stop playing minesweeper if I wasn't so FREAKING GOOD AT IT.
•I miss Lost.
•That awkward moment when you realize the one that you want has put you on limited profile.
•Finals + cramps = very unhappy situation. FML.
•If you are planning on leaning on a member of the same gender make sure it's not on an AU shuttle bus - the bus driver will call you out for "not sitting up straight" even though people at the front of the bus are asleep taking up 3 seats.
•Dear Editor,
Where's the love?
Hungrily,

•the awkward moment when my roommate walks in on me having a threesome. knock next time...
•You're the kind of guy that could break my heart in an instant, it's probably why I'm so attracted to you.
•Dear British girl from Anderson.
It is an elevator, not a lift. I don't know you but I want to hit you when I hear you tell your friend to say it in "proper english".
•lets smang it girl.
•AU biddies: how you like your eggs, fried or fertilized?
•Touched... for the never first time....
anyone else like that out there? I really felt ready to be intensely intimate when I got to college. It's been a year and a half and nothing...but I have never felt more ready. I practically let you know that I am ready to have that with you on a silver platter... and you've done nothing. Everyday I contemplate whether or not you're worth it.
•I think my love square just became a love pentagon... =(
•Dear people, the hallway right outside my room is not the appropriate space for you to hold speakerphone conversations.  I can hear you, I'm trying to get work done, and you're not even from this floor.  Someday I will come out there and make you feel REALLY awkward.  Signed, a disgruntled student just trying to study
•Does anyone else here listen to ska? All my friends back home listen to it, and I miss having someone to skank with.
•That awkward moment when you realize you forgot your towel as you are already showering and have to dry yourself with your dirty clothes

•to the lovely ladies of Letts 3rd floor who complain every time someone from Anderson uses their bathroom, suck it up. We don't complain every time you use our laundry or run through the hallway at 2 in the morning and rip signs from our doors so do me a favor and relax.
•Historical figures I have a crush on, edition 1: Voltaire, Raphael, those that participated in the Parisian Uprising (but only as depicted in Les Miserables)
•Dude, I lied last night. Of course it's not ok.
•I wish you two would just get together already and stop beating around the bush. You guys would be perfect cuddle buddies, just admit it :) Best of luck! #FinalsLove
•BLAH BLAH BLAH CHARLES DARWIN WHO ARE YOU
•@"parents have not paid for any part of my education"    Me too! (Well, my parents paid for my applications, and they drive me here, and my mom is great about making me food and buying me my favorite pens for Christmas...) Anywayy, financial aid & student loans #forthewin! Feel proud.
•To Enemy #2: I'm sorry that I had to work, putting lights on tiny ballerinas, and could not be at the holiday party to receive the iTunes card I won. You owe me.
