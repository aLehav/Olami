Junior guard Sa'eed Nelson goes in for a layup during a Feb. 2 game against Holy Cross.
In its first home game of the season, the AU men’s basketball team came out of the locker room looking invincible. The team sprinted out to a 16-point lead early in the first half, but wasn’t able to maintain it. The Eagles suffered its second straight loss, this one to the William & Mary Tribe, 79-70 on Friday night in Bender Arena.
Senior point guard Sa’eed Nelson and redshirt sophomore combo guard Jamir Harris led the way for AU, scoring 22 and 16 points, respectively.
Despite the Tribe’s combination of 7-foot Wisconsin transfer Andy Van Vliet and 6-foot-10 Mid-Major All-American Nathan Knight, AU (0-2) started four guards, none of whom are taller than 6-foot-4.
“We don’t have any other big people,” said AU coach Mike Brennan. “Those [four] are our best players.”
AU’s guards came out playing aggressively, marching the Eagles to an early 26-10 lead, while shooting five of eight from beyond the 3-point arc.
Given the size of William & Mary, it was important to Brennan to have his team come out firing.
“We were gonna move, get them moving, score from the perimeter [and] put some pressure on them, which we did early on,” Brennan said.
After building up a 16-point lead, things went downhill for the Eagles. AU started missing 3-point attempts, and William & Mary ended the first half on a 26-12 run to pull within two points of the Eagles at the half.
The negative momentum AU had going into the locker room stayed prevalent in the second half. William & Mary went on a 13-2 run early in the second half to extend the team’s lead to seven points. Despite many spurts, AU could not take over the lead for an extended period of time.
Many of AU’s issues in the second half had to do with William & Mary’s big men Knight and Van Vliet, both of whom dominated AU senior center Mark Gasperini. The duo finished the game with a combined 40 points and 20 rebounds.
“It’s a tough matchup,” Brennan said. “That frontcourt is a handful.”
In addition to Nelson and Harris’ impactful performances, sophomore shooting guard Jacob Boonyasith scored 11 points for the Eagles, while sophomore small forward Connor Nelson added eight.
Moving forward, Brennan feels that his team needs to work on its consistency.
“We can execute up to a certain point, but we’ve got to get to a point where we can sustain it for the whole game,” Brennan said.
Next up, AU will travel to Foggy Bottom to take on crosstown rival George Washington on Tuesday at 7 p.m.

President Sylvia Burwell announced on Sept. 17 that Board of Trustees member and University alum Jack Cassell had donated $3 million to the University in order to build a new Center for Athletic Performance, or “CAP,” as reported by The Eagle. This center was further funded by another alum donation. The center will serve both student-athletes and students in some capacity on campus. The current plan is to move the strength and conditioning rooms and wrestling room the Center for Athletic Performance, along with providing space for the University's Division 1 athletic teams and the club and intramural teams to compete. There is still a need for fundraising for the center, as this will not be paid by the University’s budget. Currently, it is unknown where the Center will be located or what different amenities will be included.
This donation for an athletic center comes at a complicated time for students. Across campus, the student body is suffering from construction fatigue, especially as the quad is increasingly difficult to navigate. It is also questionable where this facility could go; with the Hall of Science nearing its construction end date, it is unclear where this next building could fit onto an increasingly crowded campus. Even knowing that this facility will have benefits for the University, the logistics and future construction are a depressing reality for students.
Some criticisms have also been in reaction to the idea of building an athletic center at all. It is understandable why students may hear about a large donation to the University, and look at the long wait times for the Counseling Center, broken classroom buildings and lack of club funding, and feel frustrated. For some students, University athletics and their facilities are not at all a part of their AU experience. When there are so few resources to go around campus, especially when one part of the student body appears to be getting so much, questions about priorities are fair to ask. Explaining the potential campus-wide benefits to this donation may have been helpful for students who believe that priorities should lie elsewhere. However, the reality is that new athletic facilities are needed for student-athletes.
Current facilities at AU are simply not at the same level as many comparable schools. When facilities are small or aging, it is not attractive for recruiting better athletes. There is also a safety factor, as student-athletes use increasingly poor equipment, the potential for injuries also increases. To be competitive in the Patriot League, as our University sports teams work to be, there is no getting around a new center.
There is also the potential for revenue generation with better athletics programs. Most of AU’s revenue currently comes from student's tuition dollars instead of an endowment or other source of revenue, as is ideal for universities. With a better athletic program, there is real potential for higher game attendance, which could bring in another, more sustainable source of revenue. It could mean more money in the long run, and more money for other student needs. This facility will also make it easier for the students playing club and intramural sports to have access to practice and competition space that is currently highly competitive. Students are also increasingly adding HFIT classes in their schedules, to the point that several end up with waitlists. Added space means more students can incorporate physical activity into a healthier college student lifestyle.
Frustration among the student body is understandable, as it often feels like no one at the University is listening to student priorities. It would be interesting if a University donor considered holding a town hall with students to hear what they think millions of dollars should go towards. In the end, however, it is the person making the donation who signs the check and decides what they want to invest in on campus.
Instead of constant in-fighting over resources that students have no control over, students should support each other when good things happen to their peers. When the Hall of Science was announced, there were many who complained that there was “no reason” for the building as AU is not known or particularly highly ranked in the sciences, especially with so many other issues on campus. However, the sciences are the fastest growing undergraduate major at AU, and the current lab building has been literally crumbling. It was simply time for an improved space on campus. The fact is, there will always be something that one may think needs or doesn’t need funding. Supporting the University's student-athletes, who need a better facility, is worthwhile even if you’ve never stepped foot in a campus gym.

Recently, I had the opportunity to go on a police ride-along as part of as a requirement for my Intro to Systems of Justice class. We were given the choice of attending a court session or a ride-along, and, having seen many of the former, I decided to try something new. I went into my appointment in the fifth district police station feeling nervous, but expecting the four-hour block to go by relatively uneventfully. What I didn’t realize was how much the experience would alter my understanding of the D.C. community. 
For the most part, students at American University live in Tenleytown and its surrounding neighborhoods. Driving through the McMansions and parks in this small region in D.C. marks it clearly as an area of wealth and privilege. AU students travel from here to Capitol Hill and back, leaving an entire half of the city a complete mystery to them. It was a mystery to me too, until I went on this ride-along. 
During my time with the officers, an arrest took place, and I was a witness to the incident and the lengthy process that followed. Because of this, I was told that I would have to give a witness statement once we’d arrived back at the station to accurately detail the events I’d seen. The conversation I had with an officer at the station was an eye-opening and uncomfortable one. 
Although the experience heightened my appreciation for the breadth of responsibilities and risks that come with the role of a police officer, the rhetoric employed in that conversation was disappointing to me. The lives of the people who lived in the fifth district were being explained to me as if they were a single, monolithic experience. Words like “they,” “them,” and “those people” were used as descriptors, robbing the people in this district of their individuality and equality in just a few sentences. 
The deeply-rooted injustices that occur through our policing system in this country on a daily basis are no secret, but the ability they had to interact with my own life was entirely new to me. Growing up in an upper-middle class, suburban town in New Jersey that was largely populated by people that had the same background I did, I never had any personal interaction with racial tensions or even distrust in our local police. This lack of personal interaction made me blind to tensions that may very well have been present in my quiet town. Stepping outside this Tenleytown bubble will not only widen students’ perspectives of the intricacies of their city, but also give them the tools to recognize these same injustices on their own campus. D.C. isn’t all high-profile meetings and press conferences; it’s a microcosm of our country and an opportunity to see policy, whether it be good or bad, in action. 
As I drove back from this experience, the city changed before my eyes. It went from too many townhouses crammed together on the same street to large single-family homes, each with their own garden and driveway. If students at American University really have ambitions of changing our country for the better, what better place to start than D.C.? It’s the nation’s capital, but more importantly, it’s our home. The divisions within D.C. exist in a very physical sense, and can only be recognized by taking the time to see it.

The referendum abolishing class and student councils failed with 57.6% of non-abstaining students voting for the referendum, short of the two-thirds majority required for constitutional amendments. The other referenda, one for changing the start date of senate terms and one that gives School of Education students senate representation under the CAS senator, passed, receiving 85.8% and 87.3% of the vote, respectively.
After technical issues delayed the election by two days, the election was held between Wednesday, Oct. 30 and Friday, Nov. 1. For the second year in a row, voter turnout reached a record low, with 966 undergraduate students voting, according to Election Commissioner Eamon Vahidi.
“I think part of the reason [for the low voter turnout] is the reputation of AUSG,” Vahidi said. “However, part of that was also that there was an issue where the mass email list that was being used, provided by AU, that did not include all the freshmen.”
In addition to the referenda, the results for seats in the student senate were also announced. Furthermore, with the student and class council left intact, those results were also announced. 
This year, despite lower turnout, there was a high number of candidates from the class of 2023, with 11 candidates for five seats, noted Carter Foust, an associate member of the Judicial Board. Meanwhile, the number of candidates was lower than usual for class council positions. Vahidi pointed out that the prospect of those seats being abolished may have contributed to a lower number of candidates for those seats. 
The senate and class council results are listed below:
