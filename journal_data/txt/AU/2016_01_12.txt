Caylee Watson prepares for a loosen-up swim after competing at the Patriot Invitational in November 2015. Watson is one of seven AU swimmers who have competed in the Olympics.
Twenty-three flags line the walls of Frailey Pool, each one symbolizing a country that has been represented by a student-athlete on the AU swim team. When Caylee Watson joined the team two years ago, swimming head coach Mark Davin added a new flag to represent her home -- the U.S. Virgin Islands. Just last month, Watson, now a junior in the School of Public Affairs, earned an honor much bigger than a flag: a spot on the U.S. Virgin Islands Olympic team.
Competing for AU in early December, Watson touched the wall after her 100-meter backstroke race in 1:05.21 at the Navy Long Course Invitational, hitting a season best time and topping a 17-year-old school record in the process. Her time and previous performances at World Championship events, such as the 2015 Summer World Championships in Russia, earned Watson enough FINA points to receive a call from the president of the Swimming Federation in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Watson said she texted the president of the federation after finishing her 100 backstroke swim, and he responded that the committee would meet to discuss the Olympic team the following day. That night, Dec. 12, Watson’s phone rang with the good news. She had made the Olympic roster. 
The opportunity to compete at the Olympics represents the culmination of a journey Watson began as a 12-year-old swimmer in the Virgin Islands with a 100-yard freestyle race and ultimately brought her to American University six years later. 
Life as an Eagle
Headlights cut through the dark sky as Watson and her roommates drove to practice for another 6:15 a.m. workout. Top 40 pop music filled the car while suspense and anticipation hung in the air in between the swimmers; all three athletes quietly prepared themselves for the grueling three-hour session ahead of them. Seven days had passed since the start of the January winter training, and Watson's arms ached with soreness as she departed the vehicle and readied her body for the cold pool. The collegiate swim season at AU lasts six months with a focus on the conference championships in February, but Watson keeps her mind focused on Rio. 
Pushing through the exquisite pain of a lactate threshold set, Watson took another stroke. Seven thousand yards later, she popped out of the pool, threw on shorts and a T-shirt and headed to the gym to lift. Twenty hours a week during the school year, the ‘eat, sleep, swim, class’ schedule fills Watson’s days, and she’s found success balancing her swimming commitments in the pool with her academic and extracurricular responsibilities. 
In her previous two Patriot League Championship appearances, Watson earned Top-10 finishes in multiple events, and last season broke a school record in the women’s 400-yard freestyle relay with teammates senior Paris Wood, junior Julianna Cavano and sophomore Shannon Exley. Named the team’s MVP in 2014 and 2015, Watson scored 13 points at her most recent  Patriot League Championship meet in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. and finished her fall semester with a 4.00 GPA. Her performance in and out of the pool helped her earn distinction on the Academic All-Patriot League Team, and she credits her accomplishments at AU and her Olympic qualification to Davin. 
“Mark Davin has been my best coach, and he’s got lots of wisdom and experience, and he pushes me which is good,” Watson said. “Coming to American has made all the difference. I remember freshman year, I was very nervous about coming in here and swimming in general. I was just like, ‘just hold out one year, that’s all you need, just give it a try,’ and it turned out well.” 
Davin, who coached 1996 Olympian Casey Leger for the Atlanta summer games, said the credit belongs to his athlete. 
“I do think that it’s less me, truthfully, and more her,” Davin said. “Whatever we do, she embraces all of it. She’s kind of like a sponge that’s soaking up everything. I think if you just tell Caylee, ‘this is going to help you,’ she’s all about it, always. And it’s fun to be part of it. I think she likes to be with people that are having a lot of fun and working really hard and racing really well and being good teammates and doing well academically and having a full happy life.” 
“I wanted to go to Wesleyan” 
When Davin first received an email from Watson about training at AU, he almost denied her a roster spot. One year later, the head coach changed his mind. 
“I sent him an email, and he was like ‘no, you’re too slow,’ Watson said. “And then I sent him another email another year that I was coming, and he was like, ‘welcome to the team.’”
Even before Davin’s initial hesitation, however, Watson admitted AU was not her top choice. She said she never visited the school or toured the campus prior to her enrollment but remained interested solely because of the swim team and the opportunity to study political science in the District. 
“I didn’t even want to come here, honestly,” she said. “I wanted to go to Wesleyan.”
Watson said that Wesleyan, a small school in Connecticut, appealed to her because of its size and liberal arts curriculum. After conversations with her family, however, Watson ultimately packed her bags for D.C., but not before competing on the world stage yet again. Just weeks before moving into Letts Hall to start her freshman year at AU, Watson represented the U.S. Virgin Islands at the 2013 FINA World Championships in Barcelona, Spain. She returned to Spain last winter to compete in the Ciudad de San Sebastian meet with former teammate and 2015 School of Communication alumnus Charlie Taffet. According to Davin, Watson’s international experience helps her approach races with a different mindset than other athletes. 
“She had some world-class experience before she came here. She’d gone to some international meets and that kind of thing, and I think that as an athlete, I do believe it gives you a different outlook on what you’re doing, having had those experiences,” Davin said. “One of the reasons I set up the meet in Spain is I think the people that have made that trip, it’s changed them. Sometimes they go, and it’s just so overwhelming and so new. The second time they go, they really get it. They really start thinking about the Olympians that are there, how they’re racing, and they’re looking for more than, ‘how do I function?” 
Watson said the thought of competing in arguably the most prestigious swimming event in the world keeps her motivated through long practices, and her hard work continues to pay off. 
“I’ve definitely been more on the backstroke side this year, and I’ve been focusing a lot on rotation and making sure I’m connected even on harder sets,” Watson said. “I know I’ve been a lot more confident going into sets this year...so that’s gone well. I’ve definitely been able to do sets that I was not able to even think about doing in the past.” 
Every day at Frailey Pool, the U.S. Virgin Islands flag waves in the wind, reminding Watson where she comes from. Imagining herself competing at the Olympics in the uniform of her home country gives her added motivation at every practice. But for the next two years, Watson will also sport the red, white and blue of AU as she continues to represent the school that helped her to earn a trip to Rio.

	Vincent Gray (courtesy Gray 2014 campaign).

	If former mayor Vincent Gray runs for the D.C. Council this year, a new poll shows he has a strong shot at winning either the at-large or Ward 7 seats that are up for grabs.

	Thirty-two percent of Democratic primary voters citywide said they would vote for Gray, giving him a 12 percent lead over incumbent at-large Councilmember Vincent Orange. Further worrisome for Orange is that 4 in 10 residents responding in the same poll said they have an unfavorable opinion of him, with 28 percent favoring him.

	Meanwhile, if Gray runs in his home turf of Ward 7, he would beat incumbent and former political pal Yvette Alexander. The poll showed Gray currently holding 48 percent support, with Alexander at 32 percent. A third candidate, activist Ed Potillo, placed with 6 percent, and 14 percent of residents remained unsure.

	Supporters of Gray funded the poll through a political action committee headed by Gray’s 2014 campaign manager, Chuck Thies. The PAC raised $7,920, with all money raised going to expenses related to the poll, according to Thies, and is no longer accepting donations. The poll, conducted by the firm 
	Public Policy Polling, interviewed 1,569 likely Democratic primary voting Washingtonians between Jan. 5 and Jan. 7, according to a press release.



	Poll of citywide likely Democratic primary voters in potential at-large race.




	Poll of Ward 7 likely Democratic voters in potential ward race.

	The results are a sure boost to Gray, who has openly been 
	mulling a return to politics since the federal investigation into his successful 2010 mayoral campaign ended. That legal cloud hung over Gray’s entire mayoral term, and many say it led to his downfall in his reelection bid against current mayor Muriel Bowser in 2014.

	In December, U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips announced his office would close the nearly five-year long probe without charging the former mayor on allegations that he knew of an 
	illegal shadow campaign. Businessman Jeffrey Thompson pleaded guilty in March 2014 to secretly funnelling $653,000 to aid Gray’s campaign and said Gray knew about it. However, prosecutors were unable to bring a charge against the mayor proving he had such knowledge.

	In a statement following the U.S. Attorney’s decision on Dec. 10, 2015, Gray said, “Justice delayed is justice denied, but I cannot change history. I look forward to getting on with the next chapter of my life, which will no doubt be dedicated to service.”

Correction appended. 
News of glam rock star David Bowie’s Jan. 10 death filled the pages of Twitter this morning. The D.C. Council posted a tweet earlier that said the artist’s first ever U.S. concert took place in D.C. However, several books about the famous singer display the inaccuracies of the Council’s statement. When Bowie arrived in the District to perform, he was detained and prohibited from playing at any venue.
According to this, David Bowie's 1st US concert was in DC but no one knows where See https://t.co/jULTOQHs5Y & https://t.co/WlWt9tIzE2 2/2
— Council of DC (@councilofdc) January 11, 2016
After losing to an 18 month battle with cancer, Bowie died two days after he turned 69 years old and released his last album “Blackstar.” Although Bowie’s career spans several decades and has a fanbase across the United States, Major Tom’s (a name Bowie adopted) first American visit was at Washington Dulles International Airport. Flying by himself on Jan. 27, 1971, the still unknown Bowie touched down at Dulles Airport.
Once on the ground, the musician was detained by immigration police for his supposed strange appearance and long wild hair. According to the book David Bowie: Starman, Bowie is quoted recalling his detainment saying, “For some reason, they seemed to think I looked strange.”
Once released, Bowie’s intention to perform in D.C. would be hindered due to the absence of a work visa. Without the ability to perform, Bowie would spend his limited visit in D.C. partying and answering questions from journalists. After his slight brush with American immigration, Bowie would soon develop a fear of flying, according to the book Bowie: A Biography.
Although Bowie’s visit to D.C. would be uneventful he would come back to take America by storm under such alter aliases as Ziggy Stardust, The Thin White Duke, and Aladdin Sane.
Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled one of David Bowie's nicknames. He often went by the name "The Think White Duke."

Earlier last week, Kim Kardashian confirmed suspicions that G.O.O.D Fridays are back. Every Friday, West will release new music much to the delight of hip-hop fans around the world. 
Although 2016 is only a week old, Kanye West has already made some considerable noise in the world of hip hop. On New Year's Eve, West dropped “Facts.” 
With production from Metro Boomin, arguably the hottest producer on the planet right now,  Kanye definitely made a bass-filled, brash statement. In “Facts,” Kanye took shots at his old employer Nike, asserting that the clothing company treats its employees like slaves. He now works for Adidas, where his shoes sold better than they did at Nike. 
Kanye proclaims “Yeezy, Yeezy Just Jumped Over Jumpman!” in the chorus of “Facts,” taking shots at Nike as well as Drake, who is signed to the Jordan Brand. His single “Jumpman” with Future was practically viral in 2015. Kanye is asserting himself as only Kanye can -- with rhymes that toe the line between confidence and arrogance. Kanye is essentially using Future and Drake’s flow in “Jumpman,” also produced by Metro Boomin. Essentially, Kanye is inferring that he’s better than Drake, Future and Michael Jordan. Kanye still has no chill. 
Last Friday, Kanye dropped another single called ‘Real Friends’ with Ty Dolla $ign, along with a snippet of “No More Parties in LA” with Kendrick Lamar.


“Real Friends” is very different from “Facts.” The track discusses the human response to the unreliable bonds of friendship and family. West is convincing in the recalling of his trials and tribulations. With production from Frank Dukes, Boi 1da, Sevn Thomas and Mobb Deep's Havoc, the song oozes authenticity. 
The snippet of “No Parties in LA” featuring Kendrick Lamar is nothing but a tease, lasting just over a minute long.  The piece of the song, produced by the legendary Madlib, reveals Kanye’s chorus, where he pleads “Please baby, no more parties in LA” followed by a smooth one-two combination with Lamar. Kendrick’s verse is a tease, starting off strong and eventually fading out. Madlib, who gained his reputation in the ‘90s, delivers a beat that gives off a classic feel, perfect for rappers who are as talented as Kanye and Kendrick. 
And if the return of G.O.O.D. Fridays wasn’t enough, Kanye also announced that he would be releasing his new album “SWISH” on Feb. 11. 
Kanye is coming back to reclaim the throne of hip-hop after a quiet 2015 and phenomenal years from Drake and Kendrick Lamar. 
If “Real Friend," “Facts" and “No More Parties in LA” are indicative of the new album, then we’re all in for a treat.
