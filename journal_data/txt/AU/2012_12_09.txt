• Tonight at the graduate reception in mgc, there was a beautiful, sexy man in a blue suit with a light blue shirt underneath his dark blue blazer. Dark hair, dark eyes, Latino. HE WAS THE SEXIEST MAN I HAVE EVER SEEN AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. Why has it taken this long? I stalked him the whole night. He was beautiful. QUIERES CASARTE CONMIGO!?!? por favor.
• @"Only at AU would people get pissed about someone calling themselves a hipster."
I just wanted to make a joke about Creed. 
• @"Guys of eagle rants: every guy just randomly puts his hands in his pants when you’re just chillin, right?"
Yes, I too, masturbate in public. Would you like to join me for some public masturbation? I will be in the Dav at 1:00 masturbating to crappy prog-punk rock and Christmas songs. And if any of the Dav staff are reading this, I publicly masturbate best to Hall and Oates.
• @ I mean I was kidding, and yeah ass doesn't smell much better. Two of the lesser evils I guess.
What?! What!? No.....No, no, no, no, no, no, no , no, no, no , no, no, no , no, no, no , no, no, no , no, no, no , no, no, no , no, no, no. What?! Two of the lesser evils? Who says that? What!? Nooooooooooooooooooooo. And it's "the lesser of two evils." What!? No. Hell, no. F' no. 
• I like how the entirety of Kogod came out to throw themselves under the bus by calling themselves stupid. 
• HEY GIRL, I AM EMOTIONALLY STABLE ENOUGH TO BE YOUR MAN. I HAVE A CRUSH ON YOU SO LET ME DESTROY YOU WITH MY LOVE HANDLES. YOU MAKE MY ARTERIES CLOG WITH AFFECTION. I MIGHT DIE OF A HEART ATTA
• There is some serious sexual tension going on here.  Why must we work together?  Why must it be super inappropriate if we were to hook up?
• I feel guilty for being jealous of my roommate's prettiness but I can't help it. I wish I wasn't so insecure.
• @Game of Thrones references for schools
You just made my desk shift
• @"SOC is House Greyjoy."  Ha.  Implying SOC kids actually have a backbone.  No way they're the badass vikings from A Feast for Crows.  
• The CAUS is either House Arryn (led by a whining, epileptic child) or House Stark (overly idealistic and self-defeating).  
Kogod is House Lannister.  They're calculating and they seem like they'll get ahead, but things have changed in the global order and they might not be as well off as they think.
CSA is House Martell.  You forget they exist, but they'll be the truly successful ones.
Eagle ranters are all Ser Jorah.  Pining, sad, and alone.
• I don't want to like you! Maybe you're just being overly nice, but you have a girlfriend! I don't know...  I don't want to fall for you, I can't! Why do I always fall for the guy I can't have?... I don't need this, I have too much craziness in my life, which no one could ever understand...
• I'm not sorry I like AUSG. Without them, so much at AU wouldn't happen. Sometimes even the senate does great work. :0
• What is "ANON"? And What is AU crush? 
• CAS is Ravenclaw 
SIS is Gryffindor 
SOC is Hufflepuff
SPA is Slytherin
Kogod are the Goblins
• My LDR bf and I got into a huge fight. Hes been ignoring me all week. How long is a reasonable time for a guy to be mad? I did yell at him a lot. But I think I've been punished enough. Should I let him sulk and ignore me for yet another week? I don't want to seem needy. Help!?
• @How will I know its you? Trust me, you'll be able to tell. I'll be dressed WAY too formally 
• You're the kindest, most gorgeous girl I think I've ever seen, but you're out of my league and I know I have competition.  Whatever, I'm good to throw down.
• SOC IS SO NOT RAVENCLAW ARE YOU KIDDING ME. 
• The semesters almost over and the guy I wanted to hookup with wont answer me. All I want for Christmas is a hookup buddy
• @ "Liberals R Tools I know you disapprove of homosexuality, but I'd go gay for you and make you my sex puppet. You are awesome!" ..........well, thanks for saying I'm awesome (I'm glad you enjoy my posts), but I assure you I am completely and 100% only into women.  And Republican women at that!  Sincerely, Liberals R. Tools.  
• Props for the "Jedi" quote. Less sinister typed out like that. 
• Don't cry because it's over.  Smile because it happened.
• To the jerks blasting Rihanna in the library- leave. Immediately. 
And I hope you fail all of your finals.
• The person who posted the Game of Thrones houses just made me LOL by myself in the library. You go glen coco!
• wow cool, not only do I have to deal with straight guys shaming my genitals, gay guys WHO DON'T EVEN COME NEAR THEM are doing it too. AWESOME, A+ for misogyny! 
• Wow, I sure do know how to make a mess of things. But in my defense, I had my fight face on this week and you were being a royal pain. I wouldn't have had such a problem with you if you weren't such an abrasive bully. 
• Go Army Beat Navy!
• Happy Hannukah! L'chiam!
• Really? You won't even text me back? I'm so glad to see you're handling this maturely, instead of doing something dumb like, oh I don't know, actually talking to me. I still care about you, but you won't even acknowledge me. Thanks for being there like you said you would be... 
• Dear Woozels: Please, please PLEASE try and get it through your heads that some people actually try to sleep at 3 in the morning. WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING?? I DON'T NEED TO HEAR YOUR VOICES PENETRATING THROUGH MY SLEEP-DEPRIVED SKULL! Very sincerely, Your Neighbor
