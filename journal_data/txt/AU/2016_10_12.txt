If you were wondering why there was so much mud on the Metro this past Saturday, look no further than the second annual All Things Go Fall Classic music festival. Dedicated festival goers spent 10 hours in the mud and rain to see a hit or miss lineup of electro-pop acts (and Ace Cosgrove). 
After it drizzled through the first three acts, Sylvan Esso reverse-rain-danced the storm away and set up a relatively dry, somewhat sloppy finish to the festival. 
Sylvan Esso, Passion Pit and Sofi Tukker were all big hits, while Christine and the Queens literally missed the festival and the rest of the lineup failed to stand out. While it is impossible to ignore the unforgettable performance put on by Empire of the Sun, as headliners of a music festival, they failed to close out the day with a bang. 
Sofi Tukker stole the show. Not only was the duo energetic, charismatic and full of confidence, but it also seemed like they were having a genuinely fun time. As with the other acts, Sofi Tukker closed its set with the big hit, “Drinkee,” but unlike some other acts the rest of the set wasn’t spent passing the time until the one song that everyone knew. 
The band also had a one of a kind instrument that fell somewhere between a small tree and an electronic drum kit. Sofi of Sofi Tukker was a particularly honest performer and serenaded a growing crowd in Portuguese and English, and was brave enough to wear an elegant all-white jumpsuit in the rain and the mud. 
After Christine and the Queens backed out of their performance, Sofi Tukker stepped in to save the day (or rather the full hour until the next set). It was a less rehearsed performance for the impromptu encore, but it was equally energetic and even had a stage dive. Ace Cosgrove briefly wandered back on stage to join in the fun and salvage an otherwise lost time slot. 
“Let’s pretend it’s nighttime and it’s not raining!” Tukker said, summing up the thoughts of everyone in attendance. 
When it came time for Christine and the Queens to take the stage, a message was put on the huge screen that read: “Regrettably Christine and the Queens have declined to perform. Stay tuned for Sylvan Esso.”
Coordinators of the event said the group refused to perform given possible risks for the backup dancers because of the wet conditions.

Maybe it was the quarter inch of mud on everyone’s shoes or the fact that many had been standing for just over eight hours, but the crowd lost a certain amount of energy by the time Empire of the Sun started performing. There is no denying the impressive, almost hypnotic production value of the Australian duo’s performance. Lead singer Luke Steele was singing into two mics at one point, flanked by backup dancers dressed for Carnaval. It was surely a spectacle, but the music was not enough to lift shoes out from the mud. 
Sylvan Esso were another standout act and proved that the band is more than just a one-hit-wonder. Maybe the band is actually a two-hit-wonder: with the release of “Radio,” the male-female duo have another widely popular song after the viral reception of “Coffee.” A song like “Coffee” and to a lesser extent, “Radio,” are songs that are seemingly best enjoyed on a cool afternoon under a blanket with someone you love rather than in the sprawling valley of nearly finished apartment buildings known as the Navy Yard park. However, with loud enough bass and plenty of backup vocalists in the crowd, Sylvan Esso became festival acts and both of its major songs became festival anthems. 
Some festival goers could be heard saying they only came for Passion Pit, and others threatened to leave as soon as Passion Pit finished. Those who left before Empire of the Sun missed out, but Passion Pit followed through with a well rehearsed performance. It seems everyone has a Passion Pit song they can sing along to and “Take a Walk” was one of the most popular songs of the entire festival. 
Early-arrivals at the festival were rewarded with an intimate Ace Cosgrove performance. Bringing a mic into the crowd and rapping amongst the people is kind of Cosgrove’s thing, as some AU students may know, but it did feel somewhat out of place in the expansive festival grounds. He was also the only local artist and the only rapper in the lineup, but his live band brought a hint of pop-rock into his performance andmade it an enjoyable opening act. 
Bishop Briggs and POP ETC didn’t make a lasting impression but admittedly put on enjoyable performances and rounded out a fun lineup I had not been entirely thrilled to experience. 
As for the festival experience itself, once you embraced the mud it became a much more enjoyable time. Hunter boots were this year’s must-have fashion statement. There were very limited activities other than the music and the 30-minute gaps between sets seemed to drag as the day progressed. A corporate sponsored graffiti wall and tarot card readings (free with purchase of ice cream) were the only structured ways to pass the time, which must have salvaged some business from bored customers for the ice cream vendor, Milk Cult.
All Things Go should be happy with what it was able to put together in only the second year of the festival. The music was the focal point, and it was good. The festival managed to book several acts who are arguably better live than recorded, and despite the fact that over half of the groups are electro-pop duos, it was never monotonous. Based on the turnout (given the rain and mud), it seems that the #ATGFallClassic has the potential to become an institution of the District’s music scene.

Sitting on my couch Friday afternoon, I got the flurry of the usual alerts from CNN, Fox, etc. that arrive when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says or does something outrageous. 
I opened a new tab in my browser, went to the Washington Post, and watched the leaked video of Trump on a bus before an Access Hollywood taping with former host Billy Bush in 2005. 
Listening to it, I was absolutely horrified. A grown man running for president of the greatest superpower in the world described violating women against their will. I know he may not have actually raped or sexually assaulted a woman, but he joked about a physical attack against another human being in the same tone that he would when talk about what sandwich he may or may not have previously consumed for lunch that day.
Using his own words, Trump lost the respect of many in his party and his country. He disregarded violence as "locker room talk" and showed the American people that he cannot be the leader of our nation. 
With his own words, he proves to us that he cannot be a just and stable leader. He proves that he does not care about the family. He proves that he does not care about the law.
As a conservative, I believe in the strength of the American family. Thinking of my mother, sister-in-law, future daughter and myself, I would never want them to be in a country led by a man who believes that women are playthings, to be touched and grabbed at any man’s will. Thinking of my father, brother, future husband and future son, I would never allow them to speak about myself or another woman in such a manner. By dehumanizing violence, Trump threw out the family values on which the Republican Party is based.
When speaking about the Hispanic community, the Khan family, the Muslim-American community, a Mexican-American judge, and more, Trump proved to the American people that he is unfit to be our leader. Most recently, he has proved to women that he does not respect their privacy. He has proven to the Republican Party that he is not worthy of our support. 
While I will not support Secretary Hillary Clinton in this election either because I cannot and will not support her big-government policies that steal from the American worker, to the conservatives still considering a vote for Trump, I say this: think about your values, your positions, your own future, and the future of your children. The person presented to us this election cycle has shown no respect for these key values, and I don't anticipate him changing any positions. I know you are scared for the future, as I am, but I encourage you to vote with your conscience and think about what kind of future you want for America. 
I suggest protecting down ballot candidates and ensuring the Republican majorities in Congress so there can be some balance, and that you consider third party candidates. However, if you decide to vote for Trump, I do not shame you. This election is difficult, and I do not blame you for voting for change, but I do not believe the change America needs can be found in Trump.
We are a great nation full of diverse people, and we have great powers as a people through our Constitution and Bill of Rights. We must think of those when voting. 
As a conservative, libertarian, Hispanic woman with deeply held values in the free market and principles of liberty, I cannot - and will not - in good conscience vote for Donald Trump this November.

When I heard about the video regarding Trump’s “locker room talk” and listened to him speak so nonchalantly about violent and life-altering acts committed against women, I sat on my bed and I cried. When I refreshed my newsfeed and was notified of yet another male Republican politician disavowing Trump, I closed my laptop and felt a deep sense of sadness wash over my heart and settle into my bones. This time, Trump’s bigotry had apparently ruffled too many feathers. Certain men and women could now relate because everyone knows a woman and no one would want to disrespect their own wife or daughter. However, this same outrage was not afforded to Muslim people or black people or immigrants or disabled people or any other person that wasn’t white or who apparently was not present in the life of a male Republican. As I sat in my bed and contemplated the end of humanity, I realized that this fight was not over. 
This election is not over and every single vote counts. The reality is that we are not only electing a president, but members of Congress who will play an integral part in shaping the progress, or the regression, of this nation. We are electing the men and women who shape policies that will try to decide the value of another person’s life. These policies will shape whether there is a planet left for our children. These laws will determine if broken systems will continue to decide whether a child is worthy of education or prison. Children, families, futures and lives depend on progress and the results of this election. We must restore the humanity in this election and therefore not voting cannot be an option. 
In 2014, only 17 percent of constituents aged 18 to 29 voted in the election; however, this demographic constitutes about 21 percent of the eligible voting population. Of course this is made harder at college as deadlines for voter registration and absentee ballot applications easily slip past, but this is just as important as any other part of your life here at AU. If you’re unsure of where to start, go here. Our votes matter and they do have an effect on the future of this country. If you say that you aren’t voting because you can’t decide, you must decide anyway. 
Think about those whose voices will not be heard in this election because they can’t cast their own ballot. When you vote, you are voting not only for yourself but for your parents, your friends, your children and families across the world who you will never meet. As you are watching the last debate, wondering how the election has become an unprecedented mess and hoping for it to be over, take hope in the fact that the ballots have yet to be cast. If you feel scared, vote. It is the most powerful way in which you can ensure that you have a say in the future of this country.

It’s happened to all of us. While waiting for your Uber when heading to the airport, Union Station, a night out on the town or just about any reason, the Uber driver is trying to find your hailing location on campus, but gets lost. The driver tries to find your location but the  time lost in finding it causes you to miss your plane, train, bus or other plans.
As convenient as using Uber can be, the fact that some drivers have trouble finding the pickup location on campus can be frustrating. When it comes to navigating AU’s campus, unlike large state schools in college towns, the roads at AU do not have names and lack signage that would make it easier for drivers to get to various campus buildings.
However, a solution that Uber and the University can adopt is available and is heavily used by some locations that Uber frequents: hailing zones. Already, at places such as Miami International Airport, Uber has a special zone at the arrivals area of the airport for passengers to hail an Uber and get picked up at. 
The notion of hailing zones is not a foreign idea in D.C. Already at Union Station or at Ronald Reagan airport, cab stands are made available where taxi cabs can line up and airport personnel assist passengers in getting a cab. Though the purpose of such stands are aimed to mitigate the illegal solicitation of rides, the idea of having designated areas for pickup should be implemented at AU. 
Hailing zones could be located on the south side of campus, near the Hughes, McDowell and Cassell Hall on the north side, and at Nebraska Hall. An Uber customer could hail a ride from one of these three zones, indicating on the app at which hailing zone they are. This system would reduce customer wait time and improve customer satisfaction with using Uber to get from AU to any destination in the DMV. 
AU already has convenient transportation. The shuttle provides service to the local Metro stop, UPass gives students free rides on the Metro system, Zip Car offers discounted memberships, but the there is lack of convenience when it comes to Uber. If AU truly wants to be a university that has affordable and convenient transportation options, the implementation of Uber hailing zones is the final part of the equation for AU to promote itself as an accessible university when it comes to transportation.
