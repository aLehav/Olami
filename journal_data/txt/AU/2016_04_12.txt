A snapshot from Truckeroo 2016.
The Scene has news for all food truck fans: the District will once again host Truckeroo, a monthly festival that features a plethora of food trucks, with the first event happening this Friday.
For those who have not yet jumped on the food truck bandwagon, Truckeroo will tempt your taste buds once a month from April through September at the Fairgrounds in southeast D.C. The idea for the food truck festival was created in 2010 by Bo Blair, owner of The Bullpen and Das Bullpen beer gardens in association with the DC Food Truck Association, Capitol Riverfront BID, Washington City Paper and Food Truck Fiesta.
The festival, which will feature 15-25 different trucks, begins at lunchtime, and continues until 11 p.m. The event will involve food, live music, corn hole and other games.
From lobster rolls, empanadas, pizza to crepes, Truckeroo offers a dish everyone can enjoy. The event displays a variety of food categories, including Spanish tapas, Vietnamese noodles, Korean barbeque and classic American soul food. Some of the food trucks featured this year are Holy Crepes, Captain Cookie & The MIlkMan, DC Slices, Kafta Mania and more. 
Holy Crepes uses fresh ingredients to create the perfect crepe. The truck offers delicious crepes for customers who love sweets. For those who prefer something a little meatier, the establishment also offers savory crepes such as chicken caprese, ham with gruyere cheese and the turkey club.
Captain Cookie & The Milkman, a Foggy Bottom favorite, is a bakery and dairy bar serving cookies, milk, and ice cream sandwiches. The restaurant has now transformed its deliciousness into a food truck and offers its popular chipwich: an ice cream sandwich made out of freshly baked cookies and local ice cream. 
DC Slices, another truck slated to appear at Truckeroo, is a pizza kitchen serving flavorful, hot slices of pizza. Fresh dough, homemade sauce and grated cheese are some of the ingredients used to create their pizza pies. They offer pizza by the slice of classic flavors, like cheese, pepperoni, hawaiian, BBQ chicken and more.
Kafta Mania, Lebanese company, serves dishes such as kafta, a Middle Eastern meal. Kafta is cooked by grinding up meat into circular shapes, adding a variety of spices and serving it all in a fresh baguette. The menu has the classic kafta served on a six-inch baguette, beef bowl and mediterranean chicken paninis.
Food trucks are found all over the District, but it is so much more fun to try all of them in one place. With the warm weather coming soon, now is the perfect time to spend with family, friends and some good food. Grab some food from the trucks, head over to the stadium to drink some beers and catch live music. There is no charge for entry, just for food and drinks from the trucks.
Where: 1299 Half St SE, Washington, D.C. 20003

AU Players presented Neil Simon’s
“Rumors” on the weekend of April 8-10 in the Mary Graydon Center. The glamorous
costumes and set design and the great chemistry of the cast made for an
excellent show. “Rumors” comes across as the funnier and frothier version of
“The Great Gatsby,” similar in its portrayal of extremely wealthy, shallow and
selfish people and the trouble they get themselves into.
Songs like Adele's "Rumor Has It" The All-American Rejects' "Dirty Little Secret" set the stage for the mischief and drama of "Rumors." Ken Gorman, played by freshman David Brewer, and wife Chris, portrayed by freshman Kate Goorland, planned an elegant dinner party for the 10th anniversary of the their good friend Charlie and his wife Myra to start the play.
Goorland, a freshman in the School of Communication, actually
performed “Rumors” when she was in high school. She said she couldn’t think of
a better way to get involved in theater again in college than with something
she had some experience with.
“In ‘Rumors’ rehearsing is always surprisingly fun because the
lines are so hilariously clever,” Goorland said. “I still bite my tongue at the
jokes, and I’ve rehearsed and done the show twice.”
“Rumors” was directed by Kimberly Rothberg, a freshman in the
School of Communication. The cast began rehearsing on March 1st, and rehearsals
were five days a week. This was Rothberg’s second time directing, the first
time being in high school.
“I was worried that because I’m new, the more experienced actors
might doubt my process or how I directed,” Rothberg said. “But fortunately,
everybody was super respectful and receptive.”
When the play begins, we learn that the Gorman’s friend Charlie
has a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and is recovering upstairs, his
wife Myra is missing and the house’s help is nowhere to be found. Then the
Gorman’s guests begin to arrive.
The first guests are Claire and Lenny Ganz, portrayed by juniors
Maria Uriarte and Sam Ferguson, and they arrive with their own drama. The
couple was hit by a car on the way to the party, Lenny’s brand new car is
wrecked and he has whiplash. Although Ken and Chris try to keep up the facade
that everything is alright, Claire and Lenny quickly surmise that something is
up, and the Gorman’s let the cat out of the bag.
The next guests to arrive are Cookie Cusack and her husband
Ernie. Katerina Pappas, a senior in the School of Communication, gave an
excellent performance as the eccentric and rambunctious Cookie, a chef who has
her own cooking show. Cookie provides constant comic relief with her sporadic
back problems, general clumsiness and airheadedness. Cookie and her husband
Ernie, portrayed by Wes Young, a junior in the School of Communication, are the
most likeable and honest characters with the only stable relationship in the
entire play.
Finally, the Coopers arrive. Glenn and Cassie Cooper, portrayed
by Patrick McLaughlin and Emily Smith, have a dysfunctional and difficult
marriage. AU Players newcomer Emily Smith, a freshman in the College of Arts
and Sciences, gave a hilarious performance as the insecure, jealous and
emotional Cassie, who believes in the healing properties of crystals and thinks
her husband is cheating on her. Eventually, the Gormans end up telling the
Cusack’s and the Cooper’s about Charlie, and as a group they try to figure out
what needs to be done.
“I thoroughly enjoyed channeling my high maintenance self,”
Smith said. “I wanted to keep an authenticity to her, so I tried not to play
the stereotypical wife off the deep end.”
The play revolves around miscommunication, gossip and lies. Ken
goes literally deaf from being too close to a gunshot, making every
conversation with him a game of telephone. The lack of household help and leads
to Cookie and Ernie taking over household duties, and the Coopers confuse them
for the help. When the police arrive to investigate the situation, none of the
characters are on the same page with their story.
“I think this piece, in a lighthearted way, encourages audiences
to take a step back and think twice before they speak,” Smith said. “The rumors
in this piece came back to bite, but luckily everything worked out in the end -
real life is not as forgiving.”

The University hosted the 4th annual presentation of the William K. Reilly Awards for Environmental Leadership on March 31. 
The awards recognize leaders in environmental governance, and are supported by the William K. Reilly fund through the AU Center for Environmental Policy as well as corporate, philanthropic and nonprofit organizations.
The awards are named for renowned environmentalist, William K. Reilly. Reilly has acted as the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, president of World Wildlife Fund and as president of The Conservation Foundation. During the BP oil spill, President Obama appointed Reilly to co-chair the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling.
“The awards ceremony was designed to honor people who have made distinguished contributions to environment, energy conservation and resource use,” Reilly said. 
The awards ceremony honored two awardees and granted scholarships to two outstanding master’s students in public administration or public policy. 
Mindy Lubber received the William K. Reilly award for work in the private sector. Lubber is the president of CERES, a nonprofit that works with large businesses and encourages them to adopt sustainable environmental practices. In her acceptance speech, Lubber spoke of protecting the next generation from the onslaught of climate change.
“If we have a future, if we are going to provide for [our children], I don’t really care if you're from a red state or a blue state,” Lubber said. “[Climate change] could, within ten years, make it impossible to avoid irreparable damage to the planet and the habitability for our kids.”
The second awardee, Bob Perciasepe, received the William K. Reilly award for work in the public sector. Perciasepe is the former Deputy Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and is now President of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a non-profit that promotes the adoption of climate policies. He spoke about the importance of having a serious discussion about climate change with different sectors of the community.
“We need business leaders, consumers, policy leaders, activists, educators, students, public servants, elected officials, everybody has to be able to say,’This is something we have to deal with,’” Perciasepe said.
After the presentation of the awards, Reilly presented two scholarships to AU masters students, Maggie McCarey and Maria Athayde, both first-year graduate students in the School of Public Affairs. The Reilly scholarships are presented to exceptional graduate students who have dedicated themselves to environmental policy.
“I have to say, having known so many of their classmates, to distinguish themselves enough to get these awards in that company is in itself pretty significant,” Reilly said of the scholarship awardees.
The ceremony ended with the keynote address from Felicia Marcus, the Chair of the California Water Resources control board. Reilly referred to Marcus as the “Water Tsar.” Marcus spoke about tackling complex problems and cooperation by using the current drought in California as an example.
“[Dealing with climate change] is not just about smarts,” Marcus said, “Smarts are important, but smart people have dysfunctions too. It's about being aware of the context we’re in, being aware of what’s happening in the room, and most important, it's about choosing to be a part of helping to get to solutions rather than playing a role that doesn’t help things get done with everyone involved.”

Jews of AU featured three-year scholar Justin Parker after his Birthright trip last winter. 
Clarification appended. 
What does being Jewish mean to you? Since its launch at the beginning of the Spring 2016 semester, the Jews of AU photo project has asked this question to students all across campus to showcase the variety of Jewish experiences at AU.
Students at Brown University created a similar project last year that became successful, prompting Hillel International to share the idea with other campuses, according to Danny Dubin, a senior in the School of Communication and students program coordinator at AU Hillel.
When the opportunity to do “Jews of AU” came to AU’s Hillel office, Dubin decided to spearhead the project along with Dani Rosen, a sophomore in the School of Communication.
“The purpose of the page is to showcase Jewish students on campus,” Dubin said. “We don’t just want students who come to Hillel every Friday night for Shabbat dinners. We really want any Jewish student to be featured on the page and to share their stories.”
Today, the page has a five person staff of photographers and interviewers who create the features. They find many interviewees by asking around in classes and clubs, but others have even been messaging the page and going to Hillel’s office asking to be included.
Justin Parker, a three-year scholar in the School of International Service, went on a Birthright trip last winter. When he returned to campus, the Birthright coordinator connected him with Dubin who asked him to be featured on the page.
“It’s pretty informal. It was a chat, essentially,” Parker said. “It was easy, it wasn’t ‘Let’s sit down and discuss who we are.’ It was what is [being Jewish] to you and what’s it like?”
Although the page is a project started by AU Hillel, it is very much its own entity and has created a space for students to casually talk with others about their Jewish story, which can be hard to find, according to Dubin.
“We really wanted it to be something that students didn’t have to feel like they had to be part of an organization to do it - they could just be a Jewish student on campus - and no matter how they express their Judaism - whether they feel very connected or not at all,” Dubin said.
The main goal of the project is to showcase the diversity of AU’s Jewish community, according to the page, and Parker believes that diversity is inevitable in the Jewish community.
“I’d imagine that each person is going to have a different story,” Parker said. “Jews in general come from everywhere; there are so many different kinds. So no matter who you talk to it’s going to be different. Nobody is going to have the same story. You’re going to achieve diversity once you talk to more than one person.” 
Dubin says it’s just the beginning for the page because the number of people writing for the page is growing, as well as the number of people sharing it. Currently, “Jews of AU” is moving toward 500 likes and hopes to continue being relatable and diverse in order to reach a greater audience.
“I’m really excited for the page,” Dubin said. “I think it does really great things for the students that are involved with it to hone their photojournalism skills, but I think it’s really great for the school as well to bring the Jewish community together and people who aren’t Jewish to see that side as well.” 
The project can be found on Facebook at Jews of AU or facebook.com/AUJews
