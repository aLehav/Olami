U2 plays at FedEx Field in June 2017.
Ask any college student what they think of U2, and if they even know who you’re talking about, you’re likely to hear all about their 2014 release debacle for “Songs of Innocence.”  Released for free to hundreds of millions of ITunes users, the band was scathed on social media for an invasion of privacy due to the automatic placement of the album in people’s libraries. Since then, the band has attempted to claw its way back to popular relevance, but it has not been a simple path. Despite having successful supporting tours for the 2014 release and for the 30-year anniversary of “The Joshua Tree,” the band hasn’t released new music since and Bono has faced several health scares.
But on Dec. 1, that all changed with the band’s release of "Songs of Experience.” The album is a return to form for the Irish rockers, not only in terms of its traditional release strategy, but also in the musical heights the album takes its audience. “Songs of Experience” is a magical album that captivates with an energy, passion and a swagger not seen from U2 in some time.
Songs of Experience opens into a dark and brooding “Love is All We Have Left.” With its mixture of synths, a slower and deep vocal performance from Bono, and a perfectly used auto tune, the song immediately sets the mood for the rest of album. Haim, a band of LA pop rock sisters, join the band for “Lights of Home,” and the band grooves confidently with a traditional rock sound. This continues through the next several titles (“You’re the Best Thing About Me,” “Get Out Of Your Own Way” and “American Soul”).  The latter two feature a captivating intermission led by a preaching Kendrick Lamar, while the former chimes along but fails to impress significantly. 
Beginning with “Summer of Love,” however, the band really begins to hit their stride. Summer is carried by an addicting guitar from Edge, and a sublime bass from Adam Clayton, with Bono painting a picture of the Syrian refugee crisis. “Red Flag Day”, has all the workings of a west-coast punk classic, something I never imagined I’d hear from a 41-year-old band. “The Showman (Little More Better)” has similar energy and punch, but the real standout of the middle portion of the album is “The Little Things That Give You Away.”  In the song, Bono is seemingly speaking to a younger version of himself, and in the middle of a full blown crisis over identity and relevance. This is the work of a front man, and a band, that knows its end may soon be here.
While many of the songs on this album have political and social undertones, few wear them on their sleeve as much as the dark and apocalyptic “The Blackout.” The song sounds like a cross between disco and metal.  The energy of the album after a few slow tracks.once again grounds the work of the band in a current-day political climate, focusing the theme of the album yet again on the state of democracy.
This fosters the perfect foundation for the grand finale of the album, including the next song, “Love Is Bigger Than Anything In Its Way.” The clear standout of the album, the song was written as a letter to Bono’s children. The song is easily one of the band's best anthems since “City of Blinding Lights” and “Beautiful Day,” and is nearly perfectly “feel good” without coming across as cheesy.  “13 (There is a Light)” brings the album full circle, ending in a moody and earnest ballad.  Like its predecessor, 13 is a song written to younger audience, not so much in terms of its melody, but in its message. The ballad is an aching tale for its listener to believe in the light of hope, in spite of the darkness that all too often gathers around it.
Ultimately, this album is so much more than a collection of individual letters and songs. Instead, the album is a letter to all of us, and more specifically, our generation, encouraging us to keep believing. Considering these past two years, it’s not surprising that so many have relinquished their optimism. In fact, in our world today, it seems that all we may have are love and an ever decreasing reserve of hope. But U2 makes it clear: love and hope are greater than anything that could ever wish to extinguish them. The world may be dark and hopeless sometimes, but we don’t have to be.

I recently spoke with Serena Nangia, founder of AU’s chapter of the body positivity group REbeL. She articulated something I never consciously realized before.
“It’s ingrained in our society to talk badly about ourselves,” she said.
It’s such a simple statement, yet I found myself slightly dumbfounded upon hearing it. I know that I am guilty of hating on myself, but I never thought we could be prone to self-hatred. Sometimes, we are our own worst critics. This can cause them to disproportionately talk about why they hate themselves over why they love themselves. With that natural level of negativity infecting our minds, we often find ourselves placing strict, societal parameters on what is and is not beautiful. Once standards are in place, they are hard to break, but AU has recently made progress toward redefining beauty with the help of REbeL, which is a supportive community for students to talk about body image and eating disorders without having to go immediately to professionals.
Body image, or the way people perceive their appearances, is often forgotten amid other issues due to its deeply personalized and invisible quality. Life and news both move fast here, and, in all honesty, it is hard to actively care about everything and work at solving all issues at the same time. It is easy to get caught up in the most present problems, yet we cannot forget to continue the conversation on body image because, in the words of Nangia, “it is a continuous journey.”
In an email exchange with the Wellness Center Director, Mickey Irizarry, she said that while they do deal with body image related concerns, they often do not receive requests for it. This is not because our collective understanding of body image at AU is perfect. Rather, it’s because a conversation about self-love is elusive.
Not everyone is comfortable or at the stage of their journey to talk about their personal body image problems or eating disorders with places like the Wellness Center or Counseling Center. By providing a platform like REbeL, it gives people a choice to start small. It can be reassuring to go to a group like REbeL because it can show people who are currently struggling with body image that they are never alone in the process towards body acceptance. 
The conversation can also be avoided because people do not have the necessary language to express and understand their experience with body acceptance. REbeL aims to educate people on body image and related topics which can break stigmas around societal constructs of beauty. Should a person require professional help, REbeL hopes to provide resources. 
On Nov. 4, REbeL hosted a body positive photoshoot in Katzen Arts Center. When someone is not comfortable in their own skin, it can be difficult to take self-portraits and love the product. The purpose of the photoshoot was to provide a comfortable setting for anyone to come and embrace their physical appearances and personalities. When I attended the photoshoot, I could feel the passion of the group. Nangia and the other members were invested in providing a welcoming atmosphere where anyone could come and be accepted without judgment.
We should not talk badly about ourselves. As students, we have a host of things to be proud of. Without a doubt, our bodies should and can be one of them. With REbeL in its grassroots stage right now, it needs our help to market it on campus. The continuous journey toward body acceptance is a difficult road, but it doesn’t need to be traveled alone. I encourage everyone to consider joining REbeL as one step forward toward cultivating a campus of community, accessibility, and inclusion.
REbeL meets twice a month, alternating between Wednesday and Thursday evening meetings. More information about the organization can be found on Facebook. In the interest of transparency, REbeL is not a confidential organization and members are required to report any concerning statements to the University.

The number of music majors has decreased each year since 2013.
The number of music majors at the University has decreased by about 64 percent over the last five years, according to the Office of Institutional Research and Assessment (OIRA). In 2012, 43 students were enrolled as music majors. In 2017, 15 students are enrolled.
Now, students and faculty in the department are looking to recruit more music majors. The lack of majors this year will ultimately mean change for the recruiting and enrollment process within the music department.  
“We’ve enjoyed great prosperity for many years and the fact that our numbers are a little bit down is just part of a cyclical, natural flow,” said Nancy Snider, director of the music program.
Sean Doyle, a music and composition professor, said that he noticed the number of students enrolled is lower than in the past. Doyle began teaching at the University in August 2015.
However, like Snider, Doyle said this is not a crisis. Rather, “it is just that, in this moment, our numbers happen to be lower than when I was first hired.” 
Snider said the issue is not specific to the University, but that student enrollment for arts across the country is decreasing as well. She said that lack of targeted recruitment and adjustments to teaching methods may have contributed to the decline. 
Students are involved in the department, Snider said, but not as many are majoring in music. According to OIRA records, over the last five years the number of minors within the department has fluctuated between as little as three minors in 2015, and as many as 13 minors in 2017.
“Here at AU, we need to do more targeted recruitment internally,” Snider said. “This means finding students within the University who have a passion for music and who want to commit by majoring in it.” 
Snider said the current recruitment process involves a student initially expressing interest. Then, the department emails and communicates with the prospective student to set up an audition and meeting times with the faculty. The problem is that not every student who expresses interest in the program is automatically connected with the music department, Snider said. 
“We need every student who has an interest in music who fills out the Common App to be sent to us. I don’t feel that that’s happening,” Snider said, “Generally, we just need more communication with students who have musical interests as soon as they apply to the University so that we can build a relationship.”
Placing the music department in Katzen Arts Center -- far from the main quad -- also creates a division between the music department and the rest of campus, Doyle said.
“Part of our responsibility as faculty is to be aware of the fact that this problem is not unique to AU and to see how other programs like ours are dealing with it and then, if we are not doing those things, finding a way to do them,” Doyle said. 
Nina Larson, a vocalist and music major, said she was not surprised that the department was struggling to recruit new students because of the career opportunities associated with music.
“It is difficult to find success in the music industry without following along the path to grad school, and this prospect is scary to students who are passionate enough about music to take it on as a major,” Larson said.
Christian Kahn, an audio tech major, said he did not expect a decline in students because the Katzen Arts Center is a “great facility for the music department” with “an abundance of practice rooms.”
However, Khan also said it may be a university-wide issue instead.
“The way the University is promoted is to be a more political science and research-based university,” Khan said. “They have a great music program, but they are not as vocal about it.” 
But Snider is optimistic, comparing the revamp to “a forest that burns itself so it can make new growth.” The program is exploring adding a master’s program to its offerings, Snider said. This could improve enrollment numbers, Doyle said.  
“When we noticed going into this academic year that the numbers were lower than we had hoped for, it was all a matter of everyone getting together and being like, ‘what can we do?’” Doyle said. “I don’t know if it’s all of a sudden we have this morale that’s common, but [the low enrollment rate] has amplified something that already existed.” 
Snider stressed that the master’s program is still in its early days of development and it will be explored more in the spring. She said is still unphased by the decline in enrollment.  
“We are strong,” Snider said. “We are the little engine that can and we will.”
