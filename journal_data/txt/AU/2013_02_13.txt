A shuttle bus hit a cement truck on Feb. 13 between the Tunnel and Hughes Hall around 3 p.m., according to Alex Bradley, a freshman in the School of Public Affairs who was on the shuttle during the collision.
Around 15 students were on the shuttle when the bus struck a stationary cement truck. No one was injured, Bradley said. 
Tony Gonzales, a construction worker who witnessed the accident, was flagging a tractor-trailer truck on the north side of campus when the shuttle came up the hill from South Side and tried to pass the stationary cement truck, Gonzales said.
The cement truck, which had an Aggregate Industries logo, stopped in the direction of the Tunnel when the accident occurred, Gonzales said. The Blue Line shuttle was driving toward Hughes when the backend of the bus, behind the back right wheel, came in contact with the front bumper of the cement truck.
Students did not appear to feel the collision, Bradley said.
“The bus just stopped,” Bradley said. “It was kind of awkward.”
The shuttle and truck did not look like they suffered significant damage during the crash.
Public Safety blocked off the road between the Tunnel and Massachusetts Avenue, while the two vehicles completely blocked the road. However, students were still able to walk past the scene while the investigation took place. 
All of the students exited the bus and most went to the Red Line shuttle stop across from the Katzen Arts Center, Bradley said. Other shuttles continued to run while the accident was being investigated by Public Safety, he said. 
“[That is] how you want these things to happen, [with] no one getting hurt,” Bradley said.

As deputy director of the Community Service Coalition (CSC), I noticed that the MLK Day of Service was not given the attention it deserves in the most recent editions of The Eagle.
AU represents a passionate, motivated, selfless and caring community. Every day, students, staff and faculty alike all devote countless hours to social justice issues. While the “culture” of service is usually one of anonymity and modesty, we should celebrate the positive social change every person makes when they volunteer. 
On Jan. 19, over 100 volunteers from the greater AU community made their impact felt at nearly a dozen sites in honor of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. To highlight just a few of the projects, we prepared meals for the homeless and low-income seniors with the Campus Kitchen Project, assisted the Women’s Collective with their peer education programs for sexual health, organized a food pantry for Damien Ministries, marched on the Mall for workers’ rights with UNITE HERE, helped sort materials for the MLK Library for the Blind and provided companionship to the aging at the Washington Home & Community Hospice. 
In my opinion, a small picture in the print version of The Eagle does not do the event justice, nor does it serve to inform students about future ways to get involved.
Sarah Palazzolo’s “Quick Take” article from one year ago rightly reminds us that service is more than a one-time event. I wish The Eagle would feature more stories about the impact AU’s hardworking volunteers are having on the community. The paper has neither made mention of past successes (such as the National Day of Service in September which featured nearly 50 students participating in six service outings both on- and off-campus), nor the dozens of smaller projects our dedicated members are planning on their own. 
While the article on the Sue Marcum Day of Service several months ago was welcomed, it lacked crucial details that would have strengthened AU students’ ability to serve. Most importantly, it should have published the details of when and where the event would take place. 
It also should have mentioned that students needed to sign up using the EngageNet function on the Community Engagement and Service (CCES) website and that we would all take AUTO vans together. Finally, the article should have provided who to contact for more information, as well as volunteer opportunities in the future. Despite our best efforts, how many students know where the CCES office is or how to contact the CSC?
While the increased attention on service activities by The Eagle’s reporters is encouraging, it has not necessarily enabled the AU community to better live up to our motto: turning ideas into action and action into service. I sincerely hope the CSC and The Eagle can work closer together in the future to address these issues and serve the greater community.

UPDATE: Feb. 13, 12:58 a.m.
Student Government’s structure will remain the same after the SG constitutional reform referendum failed to pass on Feb. 12.
If passed, the referendum would have allowed SG to dismantle itself and create a new Student Association.
597 students voted “yes” while 409 voted “no.” A ? majority was required for the reform to pass, according to an SG press release. 
This referendum results saw an increase of 408 student votes, compared to the last referendum vote in Dec. 2008, according SG Board of Elections Chairwoman Chloé Profit. Profit resigned from the BOE after releasing the vote results.
“To say that we got over 1,000 votes makes me really proud to be an AU student,” said Alex Hoffman, SG senator for the campus at large and campaign manager for “Students for Transparency,” a group of AU students who opposed the constitutional reform. Hoffman was the only senator to vote against creating the referendum. 
The reform would have replaced the Undergraduate Senate and the Judicial Board with a Board of Representatives and created four vice president seats for advocacy, programming, communications and finance, The Eagle previously reported. 
The four vice president seats would have been automatically filled without reelection by the student body, Hoffman said.
AU Dems opposed the referendum because it would have cost students through tuition and student fees, according to AU Dems’ Jan. 23 statement. 
Looking ahead for SG
The Senate members who supported the referendum will continue to work for reform, according to the “AU for SA” Campaign Manager and SG Comptroller Joe Ste.Marie.
“It’s time to actually do some advocating, because students are facing bigger issues than ever before, and that has to be our priority,” Ste.Marie said.
The failure to pass the referendum will also allow the reform to be discussed more publicly, according to Hoffman. 
“Even though we [Students for Transparency] won, almost 60 percent of people voted for the constitution, meaning they want to see change in SG.... We agree that SG needs to change and we agree that it’s broken, but we just want to do things differently,” Hoffman said.
SG will return to focusing its attention on advocating for students, despite the failure to pass the referendum, according to former SG President and Class of 2013 Sen. Sarah McBride. 
“Let’s get back to work,” McBride said. 
The next election for SG is its spring nomination convention for president, vice president, comptroller, secretary, class councils and school councils on Feb. 27, SG Communications Director Rosemary Cipriano said in a press release. 
Staff writer Zach C. Cohen contributed to this report.

Become somewhat unattractive, gay, and a woman. It shouldn't be that hard to do.
• Shouts out to Frankie Ocean on the grammy wins
• Majorly crushing on someone 13 years older than me... Is there even any point? Would he ever be interested in someone so much younger than him? Or should I just give up and look for someone my own age? I just feel like he wouldn't ever even consider me as someone to date because of something as inconsequential as my age.
• just wanted to put it out there that a lookalike of BooBoo Stewart (he played seth clearwater in Twilight) goes to our school..nbd
• @ Women’s Only Gym Hours = Campus Beautification Time' Up yours :)!

• Dear "Straight, single, somewhat attractive, man here!  What do I do to rectify this!?"
Well, you can start by having sex with a guy (which will solve two of those). Then, you can always hit yourself in the face, hard. And for the man part, you only have to be a man biologically (and even that can be taken care of in this day and age). Hope this helped rectify your problems.

• @“average straight white-male has yellow fever”-yup, yes, most definitely yes being an average straight white-male this is very, VERY true! 
I myself am partial to jungle fever.
• AU - the one place where people can accuse others of being racist because of who they're not attracted to. Just like sexual preference, it's just something your born with that can evolve and take different shapes over time.
• @Men's Initiative positive ranter: that's a wonderful point. Let's just hope that if it does come about it's led by capable, mature men
• In reference to the girls who got hit by Katzen this morning...it's all very nice that one of the drivers was willing to transport the injured girls to be taken care of, but the student health center?! Even if I had a bruise after being hit by a car, I would demand Sibley over a place that would probably give me a band-aid
• Always the Mcbridesmaid, never the Sarah McBride. #Terrific #ICECREAMKONY2013 
• It's really hard to try to not remember how long it's been since you've had sex when you have to constantly hear your neighbor have sex. But really though who made these walls so thin?
• I wouldn't care about frats and sororities being the only path to a social life if they were even half as cool (or attractive) as the ones at state schools or, hell, even other private universities. Why there isn't a mass exodus to party at other DC or Maryland schools is beyond me...

• Kids in my macro class, y'all are real dummies. 
• Hello! You are all lovely people and should smile today :)
• I have spent college jumping around from career idea to career idea, not being fully invested in any of them and forcing myself to enjoy them  more. And I've been fully aware that these are not my passions. But I think I may have finally found "it." What I want to do. And it's not the most stable career path, but it's something I love and something I'm good at... I've been scared of graduating this May because I haven't known what I want to do, but now? I've never felt more secure. And it's a fantastic feeling.
• @" But on second thought, it could be really useful, especially if it could help teach what it means to be a man. "  I'm guessing that you don't either, probably because you are a chick!
• @" Slava Stalina!"  I like you... you've got a head on your shoulders!

• Wait you live in a place to which Pizza Hut delivers?!???!??!?!?!
