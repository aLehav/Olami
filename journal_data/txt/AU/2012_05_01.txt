Am I delusional? I don't know. This is really bad... I want to see you everyday but I'm probably never going to see you again. When I see you, it's the best part of my day. The few times you've hugged me, my heart sinks. Why did you make me feel this way? It's so inconvenient. I both hate and love the fact that I at least know you.



•But you're making sure I was lying when I said I believe in clean breaks.

Four AU students created a smartphone application to track AU shuttles to and from Tenleytown.
The application currently works on the Android system, but not with iPhones, Class of 2013 Senator Almas Kebekbayev said, the sponsor of the bill. 
Cameron Cook, Una Kravetz, Ally Pallanzi and James Matthews, the inventors, and Kebekbayev will be working with the Office of Information Technology on iPhone compatibility over the summer, according to the bill.
“The people who worked on this worked very hard,” Kebekbayev said.
However, the AU Association of Computing Machinery may not produce an iPhone application because most of its members do not know Apple’s programming language or agree with the amount of control Apple would have over the inventors’ creation. 
The Senate will be promoting the application in order to bring recognition to the inventors and to gather input from students, co-sponsor Senator-At-Large Joe Wisniewski said.
The Senate also called for priority registration for ROTC students at its last meeting of the year on April 29.
Priority registration would allow the ROTC students to take classes that better fit in their schedules in addition to their mandatory ROTC classes.
ROTC students have to balance classes with training, which can make scheduling difficult.
“Their schedule is just awful because of the early training, because of the military classes,” Class of 2014 Senator Dan Lewis said. “I mean my roommate didn’t really sleep at all last year because he was all over the place.” 

Cabinet Positions
The Undergraduate Senate approved the following positions:
• Kennedy Political Union Director: Alex Kreger
• Student Union Board Director: Ira Grylack
• Director of Women’s Initiative: Nefertiti Akamefula
• Women’s Initiative Programming Director: Kyla Novell

• AUTO Director: Jacqui Langer
• Bike Lending Director: Daniel Pasquale

AU offices have reduced the amount of paper used on campus this year because:
The Center for Teaching, Research and Learning certified 485 courses as “green,”
 Payroll stopped offering paper paychecks to employees in February and AU’s library has switched to 100 percent recycled paper in March.
“This will help us achieve our institutional goal of sending zero waste to landfills, as well as our ambitious carbon neutrality target of 2020,” Joshua Kaplan, sustainability outreach specialist in AU’s Office of Sustainability, previously told the Eagle.
Courses Go “Green”
CTRL evaluates professors’ sustainability efforts inside and outside the classroom through a questionnaire. A class is ranked by its amount of eco-friendly practices on a scale of one to four “apples,” according to CTRL’s Green Teaching  website. 
“One of the major parts of the program is to reduce paper consumption, and an easy step faculty can take is to post their syllabus for the class on Blackboard and not print it out for every student,” Sarah Howell, the green teaching program coordinator, said in an email.
Posting the 485 green-certified course syllabi on Blackboard has saved approximately 140,000 sheets of paper.
“Assuming that there are between 25 and 35 students in a class, and syllabi is about 10 pages, if each [green certified] course posted their syllabus online, that saved a total [about 150,000] pages of paper,” Howell said in an email. 
Payroll Office Tosses Paper
The Office of Payroll transitioned AU to a “paperless” payment system in February.
Direct deposit was the “preferred” option for employees, because it reduced paper consumption and therefore minimized environmental waste and pollutants, according to a memo released on Nov. 9. 
AU faculty and staff also had the option to switch to a TotalPay Card, similar to a debit card. 
The switch was part of the Office of Payroll’s “2012 Green Initiative,” according to their website. 
Library Works to Cut Down on Paper
The library changed the kind of paper they buy to become more environmentally friendly. Bender Library used paper that was 30 percent recycled, however, they have now transitioned to 100 percent recycled paper in all printers, library specialist and member of the Library Green Team Liam Tooher said. 
By using only recycled paper, the library has prevented the creation of 35,724 tons of greenhouse gases, Tooher said. However, the paper costs $8.36 more per box than the paper that was 30 percent recycled, according to Library Monitor Specialist Lindsey Christensen. 
AU uses 390,000 sheets of paper every calendar year and a significant portion of library printing are class readings from e-reserves, Tooher said.
Next year, the library would like to see a drop in printed pages, he said.
“We want students to do their academic readings, but to consider reading them on a computer or e-reader,” Tooher said.
Student Green Eagles have also helped with paperless initiatives at AU this year.
“I believe the Green Eagles have been successful in making students more aware of sustainability issues and that has impacted their personal habits,” Josephine Chu, a Green Eagle, said. “For next year, I hope we can expand our outreach programs so that more students are aware of what sustainability efforts are taking place at AU and how they can get plugged in.”

The D.C. Zoning Commission approved plans to move the Washington College of Law to Tenley Campus, according to an AU April newsletter. 
Construction is expected to begin in the summer of 2013 and be completed in 2015, according to the newsletter.
The project was initially submitted to the D.C. Zoning Commission in August, The Eagle previously reported. 
It faced challenges from the public and Advisory Neighborhood Council 3E. Residents have expressed concerns that the move will cause traffic problems.
This decision comes after AU’s 2011 Campus Plan was approved by the Zoning Commission in March, The Eagle previously reported. The WCL relocation project will now move into the design phase.
This will be the first time WCL is housed in a building specifically designed as a law school, according to the WCL February newsletter. This change is needed due to an expanding student population and current lack of public transportation, The Eagle previously reported.
WCL Dean Claudio Grossman said in an email that he is extremely pleased that plans are moving forward.
“This is an important milestone in the University’s goal of providing a new home to the Washington College of Law,” Grossman said in an email, “that will allow us to better carry out our mission.”

Yes, it is that time of year again, when The Eagle gets to lay down our iron talon and pen out our thoughts about the failures and (successes?) of Student Government. 
President McBride
Sarah McBride, formerly known as Tim, prefers to lead quietly. Her term in office has not been an emotional tour de force—there were no cape-flapping runs around campus, nor any rambunctious Welcome Week antics to set school spirit alight. That’s not to say that McBride has been lazy. She just hasn’t been visible.
To be fair, Nate Bronstein is a hard act to follow, and the two simply have different leadership styles. However, McBride’s visibility is so lacking that most of us have seen more of former president Bronstein this year than we have of McBride. It is nearly impossible to be more visible than Bronstein when he is trying. It’s quite a feat to be less visible than him when he’s nonchalantly going about his day. 
Though McBride hasn’t been spending her time engaging students like a maniac, she has been working diligently on their behalf. We applaud the efforts of McBride’s office to lobby for the creation of a LGBTA studies minor, an addition to our curricula that retains AU’s status as a leader in LGBT affairs. Her office played a key role in the creation of  Gender Neural Housing, another victory for LGBT students. She has worked well with the other branches of Student Government and has had a cordial and productive relationship with The Eagle. In every dealing we’ve had with her, she has shown herself to be an honest, forthright, genuine and outgoing person. 
All in all, we’re happy to have had McBride as SG president. Tirelessly, she has engaged the Sisyphean task of progress for underrepresented groups. And she has represented the University to outside organizations with aplomb. Next year, we hope that Emily Yu will carry on this tact and devoted work ethic—and be cognizant of the image demands of her office.
Vice President Richards
The office of the vice president is perhaps the most demanding student position on campus. It does not require visibility but instead managerial skills of a Fortune 500 CEO. This year, Liz Richards has done a positively brilliant job overseeing the Kennedy Political Union, and The Eagle can do no more than to smile in awe at the spectacular cast of speakers brought in by KPU. 
John Legend’s philanthropic dedication and musical talent left Bender Arena spellbound. Bill Clinton’s passion for fascinating ideas and Arkansas charm left us gushing (though he, too, had trouble taking his WONK of the Year award seriously). Jon Huntsman connected with our inner loser. And the Founder’s Day Ball, ticket problems aside, was a magnificent success.  
Student Union Board, however, deserves less admiration. With the exception of Matisyahu and Legend, SUB’s artist selection has been laughable. If it were 2005, we would have been screaming at the top of our seventh grade lungs to hear Gym Class Heroes. It is not 2005. Some students have complained that a small group of disproportionately influential music fans largely decide SUB’s choices. The Eagle would like to know who still listens to Gym Class Heroes. 
SUB’s continued flaws aside, Richards has done a great job as VP, and we hope VP Palak Gosar will live up to her impressive record. 
Secretary Sutherland
As secretary, Kevin Sutherland reorganized and streamlined the Student Government website, a much-needed improvement that The Eagle applauds. The Jobs Board, though it has been fraught with fraudulent postings, is on the whole a success. We do, however, take issue with Sutherland’s record communicating with the student body. After the Jobs Board went back online, for example, many students did not know that it was back up. In our private dealings with him, however, The Eagle has found Sutherland to be extremely knowledgeable and competent. We hope he will continue to improve SG’s online presence and increase student engagement. 
Comptroller Reath
As comptroller, Eric Reath has been a competent manager of SG’s budget, coming closer to spending into the black than his predecessor. 
AU Transportation Organization, however, has been a bureaucratic nightmare. We commend Reath for his passion and drive, but hope that he will reform AUTO to make transportation more readily available to students in his second term. 
Senate
The Senate is a mixed bag this year — they have, as always, taken their jobs and themselves much too seriously, but they have also been active in advocating for veteran students, an important constituency who deserves our attention. Furthermore, we are glad that they did their job in keeping the Judiciary Board members accountable. 
However, the Senate did not take a stand on adjunct unionization, declaring quixotically that adjunct professors “do not affect students.” And they haven’t made much progress in diversity. Next year, we hope that they can give us more to praise. 
Judiciary
As it concerns the J-Board, the Board of Elections has been as bureaucratic as always, and, as we have done in the past, The Eagle urges them to consider cutting away some of the campaign red tape that might contribute to the former SG problem of inclusion. 
Overall Thoughts
On the whole, SG has been a fairly active organization. The flaws it has are those it has consistently. There have been no significant, large scandals and progress has come slowly but surely. However, aside from KPU, no department gives us just cause to shower it with praise. We hope that Yu, Gosar and the other incoming SG members will build on the progress made this year and try to remedy the continued deficiencies of SG that affect the student body.   ? E

The culture of the Undergraduate Senate shifted away from parliamentary breakdowns to a focus on advocacy over the past year, according to SG senators. 
 “I think the reality is, unlike in the past where we said we are trying to change, we are changing and there is credible evidence that showcases a cultural shift so to speak,” Senator At-Large Joe Wisniewski said. 
Wisniewski credits former Speaker of the Senate Brett Atanasio and the new freshmen senators for changing the Senate environment.
“A lot of this is thanks to the freshman, too, because when they joined in the beginning of the year,” he said. “What happened was they kind of rejected that status quo and they were very passionate about fixing the problems that they saw.”
Wisniewski and Atanasio both said the focus of the Senate has shifted from internal bills to advocacy and outreach bills. Internal bills focus on the by-laws and governing documents and external bills addresses advocacy issues that occur outside of SG.
“The Seventh Senate has been really big about trying to reach out to students, so that they can voice their concerns and so that we can more effectively advocate on behalf of their interests and needs and that’s really important,” Atanasio said. 
Although less internal bills were passed this year, the Senate has a responsibility to pass internal legislature to help regulate SG. These bills include passing the budget or creating meetings between the heads of the branches, senators said. 
“The Senate has both an advocate function and a watchdog and reformer function,” Atanasio said.
Atanasio said this focus on advocacy might have been a response to student criticism toward the Senate. 
Here are some of the major bills passed by the Undergraduate Senate this year:
Gender-Neutral Housing
The Senate passed a bill on Nov. 1 supporting gender-neutral housing including freshmen and transfer students, The Eagle previously reported. 
SG worked with the Residence Hall Association to make gender neutral housing available next year in Centennial Hall and Roper Hall, The Eagle previously reported. 
“Almost immediately after that bill was passed there was a large scale movement within the administration to begin that,” Atanasio said. 
Housing and Dining has been working on securing more on-campus gender-neutral housing since 2006, but after the SG and RHA discussions showed support this year changes began, Chris Moody said, the assistant vice president for Housing and Dining.
Scholarship
Former SG President Sarah McBride vetoed the initial bill to fund the SG Civic Engagement Scholarship when the Senate intended to give the three recipients a $1000 for the spring semester, instead of $2,000 recipients would receive the next year.  
The bill was passed on Nov. 15, The Eagle previously reported.  The three recipients are George Fountain, Brittany Gada and Victoria Ramirez.
Editor’s Note: Tim McBride asked The Eagle to use her new preferred name, Sarah McBride.
End of SG?
The Senate passed a bill calling for a committee to rewrite the constitution at their April 22 meeting. 
SG is now accepting applications for seats on the committee that will rewrite SG’s constitution. 
The committee will work over the summer to write a constitution, which the student body will vote on in a special election next school year, The Eagle previously reported.  
Budget
The Senate approved the budget on April 22 for the next academic year.
While the bill was categorized as internal by Wisniewski and Atanasio, both called the bill important, as the Senate is responsible for delegating $630,000 to SG departments, The Eagle previously reported.
“Because what it comes down to is we are also the stewards of a $630,000 budget,” Atanasio said. “And that’s $630,000 of students’ money that the Senate literally has direct control over. And that’s a very serious thing.”

AU hired a lobbying firm to ensure the Army Corps of Engineers’ Spring Valley project would remain a priority of the U.S. government and maintain adequate funding. 
The project consists of the search and removal of World War I munitions on AU-owned property.
“With no voting representation in Congress [Eleanor Holmes Norton’s D.C. delegate status excepted],” Camille Lepre said, assistant vice president for communications & media, in an email, “it was important that AU find elected officials who were sympathetic to our concern that the project funds not be diverted to another Corps projects, which did have a Congressman/woman advocating for it.” 
The University employed D.C.-based Cassidy and Associates from 2005 to 2009. The annual expense for the company’s services was a little under $145,000. The money spent came from AU’s operating revenue, according to Lepre.
Other schools that have hired the firm include:
• Boston College
• Boston University
• Alfred University
• Seattle University
• Crowder College 
• Creighton University
AT&T, Allstate, Walt Disney and the Embassy of Pakistan/the Islamic Republic of Iran are a few of Cassidy’s high-profile, non-academic customers, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, an organization that tracks money in politics. 
“The University’s efforts benefited not only AU but the Spring Valley community by keeping the Corps funded and focused,” Lepre said. “During the term of the engagement, funding for the cleanup was increased substantially, enabling work to be completed in a much shorter time frame than originally planned.”
The lobbying services also helped keep costs down on one of the Spring Valley areas highlighted by the Army Corps called the Lot 18 project, Lepre said,  since the sustained funding allowed the Corps could continue its work without disruption.  
The University has a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status and is defined as a nonprofit organization. Under federal law, nonprofit organizations are allowed to lobby. But they are limited on the amount of money that can be spent on lobbying. Nonprofits are also not allowed to make direct campaign contributions, according to  The Center for Non-Profit’s website.

Student Snapshot, the section of the AU portal where students can view their tuition bill, GPA and schedule, will start showing more information on student finances in early June. 
The revamped tool, called Eagle Finance, will still be accessible through students’ portals, according to letter sent to students on April 29.
Eagle Finance will provide students and their families with a more detailed and user-friendly breakdown of student finances, according to the letter.
Eagle Finance will break down charges, payments, anticipated financial aid and refunds for students.
Students’ payments will be divided into student, financial aid and sponsor payments.
The new Anticipated Finances section will replace the existing Pending Financial Aid section.  It will provide information on students’ individual, anticipated and distributed award amounts.
Students will also be able to view refunds made to their accounts and if they are being refunded by e-check or paper check.
E-billing and the ability to view and print PDF bills off the AU portal will also be introduced soon, according to the letter.

AU and the union representing the University’s adjunct faculty members, Service Employee International Union (SEIU) Local 500, entered into contract negotiations on April 16. 
The new contract will be a compromise between the University and its adjunct faculty members.
Director of Research and Strategic Planning at SEIU Local 500 Anne McLeer said the two parties are still discussing what the adjuncts have voiced as problems, such as job security and adequate access to services on campus.  
McLeer said if all goes well, a contract may be finalized by the end of the calendar year.
“It’s impossible to tell right now,” she said. “But if we proceed as it’s going so far, we could be finished by December.”
The groups have not discussed economic issues such as adjuncts’ pay, according to Student Worker Alliance (SWA) member and School of Public Affairs junior Ethan Miller. Miller has stayed in tune with the issues by checking in with SEIU Local 500 and various adjuncts to ensure student support, he said.
“We’re keeping our eyes and ears open,” he said. “If things aren’t going well with the University, we’re going to take action.”
Miller said SWA will provide student support by rallying to ensure AU’s adjuncts are paid well.
“Our priority is paying professors well so we can get a good quality education,” he said.
However, the University and SEIU Local 500 will continue to hold meetings throughout the summer and into the fall until a contract is established.
Both parties believe the negotiations are going well.
“We believe the negotiations are progressing in a constructive and cooperative atmosphere,” said Provost Scott Bass in an email.
“We’re very happy with the tone of the negotiations so far,” McLeer said. “I think we’re on the road to a decent agreement.”

The House of Representatives voted to maintain low interest rates for federal student loans after President Barack Obama traveled to three college campuses advocating for the extension. 
The vote came to the House floor on April 27, two days after the president visited universities in North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa to speak to students about the importance of keeping interest rates on federal student loans from rising. If Congress fails to vote on maintaining low interest rates on federal Stafford loans, the rates will double on July 1.
Because the bill takes funding away from Obama’s health care law, the White House announced that the president will veto it.
While on flight to Boulder, Obama addressed student journalists in a conference call about the federal loans that 7.4 million students are currently paying off.
“I know what this is like, because when [First Lady] Michelle [Obama] and I graduated from college and law school we had enormous debts, and it took us a lot of years to pay off,” the president said. “So that’s probably why I feel this thing so personally.”
On average, students who take out loans for college graduate with $25,000 in debt, he said. But AU students graduated with an average debt of $35,206 in 2010, which is more than $10,000 higher than the national average and holds the record among D.C. universities,  The Eagle previously reported. 
The unemployment rate for Americans without a college degree is twice as high as that for those who have one, so college needs to be more affordable, Obama told students. Higher education should be available to everyone, and making it less affordable will only give the middle class fewer ladders to climb, he said.
“Republicans in Congress have voted against new ways to make college more affordable for middle class families, even while they’re voting for huge tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires,” he said. “Tax cuts that, by the way, would have to be paid for by cutting things like education and job-training programs that give students new opportunities to work and succeed.”
The president encouraged students to contact Congress about the issue and to speak out on Twitter, using the hashtag, “#dontdoublemyrate.”
Recent AU graduates are struggling to pay off their student loans, even with the help of their parents.
Former SG president Andy MacCracken is one of those students. With $50,000 in undergraduate debt and an expected $20,000 loan for his graduate degree, he doubts he will be able to buy a home or start a family within the next 10 years because of the cost of paying back his loans. MacCracken, now the associate director of the National Campus Leadership Council, is mobilizing students to talk to the White House about the importance of reducing student debt.
AU graduate student Tara Ashraf received two scholarships and help from her parents to afford her undergraduate education, causing her to graduate without any student debt. Still, she believes the cost of college in the United States is too high – especially in comparison to European universities.
“I had a Spanish professor who said that for all of his schooling, including his Masters, he paid $7,000,” Ashraf said. “It’s outrageous how much we have to pay here for an education that doesn’t even come close to education systems that other countries have.”
