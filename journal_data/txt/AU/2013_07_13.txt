So much has happened in The Maine’s career throughout the past six years—they published two picture books in 2010, departed from their major label in 2011 and independently produced two albums in 2012 and 2013.
Last year, The Maine opened for Taking Back Sunday on their “10 Year Anniversary Tour.” From the top of the 9:30 club balcony, they viewed the show from the same point of view as the fans below them— this was a band that they all aspired to be like.
This weekend, The Maine returned to the same venue as the main act for a family of fans who can’t stop and won’t stop supporting them on their humble journey of new beginnings. 
In an exclusive interview with The Eagle, lead singer John O’Callaghan revealed that the new path the band started from Tempe, Ariz. has been leading them towards something magnificent.
Sydney Gore: I know you’re headlining your own tour; where are you guys right now? And how has the tour been so far? 
John O’Callaghan: Yeah, we’re actually off today in New Jersey. The tour has been great so far. We’re about halfway through now and have been on tour since June. We’re actually touring with friends so it’s not an awkward ‘getting to know you’ type of deal. 
SG: What is your favorite aspect of touring?
JO: Seeing cities you haven’t been to. It’s been great to continue to play for people we’ve known for so long, and then to also see new faces overseas…it’s all beautifully weird.
SG: Can you describe what the process was like for producing your new album, “Forever Halloween”? I know it was released a few weeks ago, but how long did it take to tie everything together with writing and recording?
JO: [Writing the songs for] the album took about six months. We spent two months writing all together as a band, but each record varies. Recording only took a month. We were paying for it on our own dime so we did it with a purpose…it really helped us to be motivated and work really hard for the things that we want. 
SG: What is the story behind “Forever Halloween”? (As in the album title and the general theme of the album.)
JO: “Forever Halloween” subtly conveys that just because you’re wearing things like leather shoes or a mask, they don’t represent who you are. We are all made up of the same things. With the lyrical content, I gave a little bit more of myself on this album, speaking from personal experiences. This album represents what we are capable of.
SG: Where did you find inspiration for the songs? You mentioned personal experiences and touring, but were there any other specific outside influences?
JO: For me, I think it’s really important to acknowledge the things that we love, but not create a photocopy of somebody’s art. It’s about recreating feelings. Art is so incredible because it affects people; it affects each person so drastically and differently. We try to separate the two. The only specific song where I wanted to kind of create a sound like somebody else’s was “These Four Words.”
SG: So what’s next? Do you guys plan on touring more in the fall or taking a break after this tour? Perhaps even working on your next album, though I’m sure you’re writing all the time whenever you have a spark of inspiration.
JO: Hopefully the inspiration continues to come! We have some more shows in the near future. We’ve been fortunate enough to go around the world so we want to get back out there and play for those fans. There’s a lot of running around to come in 2014. We’re just focusing on the album and taking things in steps as they come.

All adjunct professors will receive an increase in wages under the new agreement between AU and the adjuncts' union, Service Employee International Union Local 500. 
"All adjuncts will receive at least a $100 per course increase starting in summer 2013, with a further $50 per course in fall 2014," said Anne McLeer, the director of higher education and research at SEIU Local 500. "Many of the lowest paid adjuncts will receive increases of more than that." 
The agreement also established a minimum pay rate based on the number of credits for the course being taught and the adjunct's academic degrees in the field, The Eagle previously  reported . 
AU and SEIU Local 500 finalized a two-year agreement regarding adjuncts' work conditions after almost a year of negotiations.
The agreement provides adjuncts with more job security, higher wages and better access to teaching resources, according to McLeer.
"For students this contract is very important because it improves the situation of adjuncts in a way that allows them to serve students better, and to develop as teachers and academics," she said in an email.
The agreement went into effect on June 1 after representatives from the University and SEIU Local 500 approved the document.
"[The agreement] took less than a year, which is honestly not out of the ordinary," SEIU Local 500 Communications Director Chris Honey said.
Negotiations began in May 2012 after AU adjuncts voted to unionize in February of that year, The Eagle previously reported.
More job security for adjuncts
The University will try to reassign an adjunct to another course if he or she is removed from teaching his/her current course under the "good faith consideration" of the agreement. 
However, this consideration only applies under certain circumstances, including:
• The course's  program or department is downsized or eliminated
• The course is to be taught by a full-time faculty member
• The course is cancelled due to under enrollment 
• An adjunct with a higher rank, more professional experience or a better teaching record is available to teach the course.
Job security was one of the main reasons adjuncts chose to unionize in November 2011, The Eagle previously reported .
The contract implies an adjunct professor will not be reassigned to teach another course if she or he fails to complete professional duties, exceeds the maximum of credits permitted in previous or current years or produces unsatisfactory results based on student evaluations and observations.
The agreement also includes:
• an established three-step process for adjuncts to submit grievances to the University
• a requirement for AU to notify adjuncts of upcoming assignments in written form with a one week deadline for adjuncts to accept or deny
• access to specific services for adjuncts, such as physical space to meet with students
• the formation of a committee with representation from AU and the union to address any other issues.
School of International Service Professor William LeoGrande, who represented AU during negotiations, said he believes the changes will be more noticeable after a semester or two since the University is currently deciding 
how to implement the agreement. LeoGrande served on the bargaining team that wrote this agreement.
The current agreement will end Aug. 31, 2015. Negotiations for the next agreement will begin early 2015, according to LeoGrande. 
The first agreements negotiated between adjuncts and University officials at George Washington University and Montgomery College each took longer, according to Honey.
"Future contracts will not be nearly as lengthy since we'll be working off the basics," Honey said.

Bike lanes on New Mexico Avenue, near AU’s main campus, may become a reality after a showing of local political support. 
The Advisory Neighborhood Commission for Ward 3D, a group that can recommend public policy changes in the area, voted to support the construction of the lanes at a July 10 meeting.  
The resolution, introduced by School of Public Affairs Senior and ANC 3D10 Commissioner Joe Wisniewski, passed by a vote of 5-4.
The ANC board recommended five feet for the bike lanes to help drivers merging from Westover Place, according to the resolution. 
Wisniewski, who represents the Greenbriar, Berkshire and Avalon apartments, and School of Public Affairs junior Rory Slatko voted in favor of the resolution. Slatko is the ANC commissioner of Ward 3D07, which encompases students living in Anderson, Centennial, Leonard, Letts, Hughes and McDowell Halls.
However, some neighbors are concerned the five feet bike lanes will cause New Mexico Avenue to become congested, Wisniewski said.
“Currently New Mexico is like a parking lot without any parking lines,” Wisniewski said. “It’s a complete mess.”

The Berkshire Food and Drug store may be legally evicted in court later this month by following its refusal to leave the property. 
Gables Residential real estate company, which manages the Berkshire Apartments, may have to explore legal options to regain access to the space, according to School of Public Affairs senior and Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3D10 representative Joe Wisniewski. 
The current owners continue to operate the convenience store located in Berkshire Apartments’ lower levels in protest of the decision to close the store and renovate the location, according to Joe Wisniewski.
Gables Residential plans to turn the space into a Wi-Fi café and study room while increasing the size of the gym, according to an  online petition  against the changes.
The current owners of the store did not comment on the store’s operation. Gables Residential did not respond to requests for comment.

Australian singer-songwriter Lenka has written songs that have been used in TV and film. Her song “The Show” most notably appeared in Bennett Miller’s 2011 film “Moneyball” starring Brad Pitt. 
She’s now bringing that dreamy folk style pop to Arlington’s IOTA Club & Café on Sunday, July 21. The Eagle’s Tam Sackman talked to Lenka about parenthood, Czech food and the current state of pop music.
Tam Sackman: I’ve read that you were heavily involved in the performing arts back in Australia. How has your experience as an actress translated into performing musically?
Lenka: In a few different ways. One would be that I have a little bit of a theatrical-ness when I sing, I think maybe more than some other singer-songwriters have today. I do enjoy bringing out the drama in a song. I think that’s probably left over from my time as an actress. Even the way that I approach the making of a song is influenced a little bit by my acting experience in sort of getting obsessed with things like human interaction and emotion, the way we communicate, stuff like that. 
TS: Your upcoming tour has dates all over the East Coast USA, Europe, Russia and your home of Australia. What’s the best part about touring internationally? 
L: You know, it’s the best and the worst at the same time. You’re getting to go to these places that are so far away and so different culturally. It’s also really exhausting to travel. Even sometimes just the kind of culture shock or feeling homesick or trying to find something that you want to eat in a country where you might not like that culture’s food could be hard. 
You mentioned Russia, and I’ve never been to Russia, so that will be pretty interesting. I’m actually half Czech and I do like some of their cuisine but I do know that I don’t like a lot of the food and I think it's kind of similar. I’ve toured in Poland and I know it can be hard to find a fresh salad, for example, so that’s going to be interesting. But the positives will outweigh the negatives for sure. It’s going to be a lot of fun.
TS: A lot of people first hear of your music through other forms of media like TV and movies, you were featured in a bunch of commercials and on the show “Grey’s Anatomy” and the movie “Moneyball.” Why do you feel that your songs are such a popular choice?
L: I don’t know, but I’m very grateful for it. I think that I kind of lucked out, timing wise, it’s just sort of what’s in fashion at the moment, the sort of girly, singer-songwriter stuff. 
In this kind of musical era where radio is changing and the Internet is a much more powerful medium, having my songs play on TV is actually a really great way to introduce my music to people. Also, I get a real kick out of it, especially in films when a song of mine plays a pivotal, emotional role. 
TS: How has your music changed since you became a mother?
L: It’s changed quite a bit actually. I made a lullaby album (“Shadows”). It’s sort of made me mellow out musically. I want to make music that’s really soothing, and gentle and calm. That’s probably something I’ve always wanted to do, but I think now is the right time. 
I think my perspective as a songwriter has changed. The voice of the lyrics, where I’m coming from, has shifted a bit, from me completely self-obsessed and complaining about my life and how I’m so depressed or confused or whatever it is. I don’t have as much time for that anymore, so it’s more like partly I want to pass my wisdom down to my child and the next generation and partly I just want to find hope and optimism and gorgeousness and kind of spread that around. 
TS: How do you feel about the current state of pop music? 
L: I think that there’s some great stuff going on. There’s some pretty boring stuff going on, too. I’m getting a bit bored with the whole dance music thing. But, it’s interesting to me. Basically, everybody wants a good pop song and everybody wants a great chorus, or a great hook. Something that makes them feel good, that’s really accessible, that they can remember or sing along to when they’re driving around or out drunk with their friends. 
TS: Your most recent album involves a collaboration with your former “Decoder Ring” bandmate, Tom Schutzinger. How was it working together again?
L: It was great. It really felt like we had come full circle because he was one of the first people that I started jamming with when I first started getting into music and gave me the opportunity to start professionally with their band. And I really like his beautiful sensibility. He’s pretty weird, so it was nice to have him take me out of my comfort zone, and just mess it up a bit, especially with layering and the structure of songs. 
Also, I know him really well, he lives down the road from me in Sydney and I had a little baby when I worked with him and we would go to his house and my husband would be looking after the newborn baby in the next room while I was in the studio, and I’d pop out and breastfeed him. You can only really do that with people that you know well. 
TS: Where are you most looking forward to stopping on your upcoming tour?
L: I’m really quite excited for New York. Also, later in the year I’ll be in Turkey, and I’m really curious as to what that will be like. 
Catch Lenka at the IOTA Club & Café in Arlington, Virg. on Sunday, July 21 at 8 p.m. Tickets are on sale for $15.

More parking spaces will become available for Tenleytown drivers if the D.C. City Council passes a bill curbing spillover traffic from new construction projects.
The Neighborhood Parking Protection Act of 2013 would ban construction companies from issuing parking permits to future tenants, preserving already-scarce street parking for current residents. 
“[R]esidents are increasingly concerned that tenants of new developments are not utilizing parking infrastructure - below ground and off street - that the city often requires new development plans to include,” said Ward 6 Councilmember Tommy Wells in a June 4 press release.
The bill is also a response to a standoff between development company Douglas Development Corporation (DDC) and the Ward 3 Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC). 
ANC allowed the company to build a new retail building at the site of the abandoned Babe’s Billiards on Wisconsin Avenue last year, The Washington City Paper reported. 
However, city representatives worried DDC would not complete the project without building new parking spaces, the report said. 
Joe Wisniewski, School of Public Affairs senior and ANC 3D10 Commissioner, said the bill would force construction companies to honor their contracts with the city. 
“If it weren’t for this bill, the parking bans wouldn’t have any teeth,” he said. 
Wisniewski said transportation is a crucial issue for Tenleytown, which merges traffic from Virginia and Maryland. 
By discouraging driving, the bill also balances economic growth and sustainable development as more people move to the city, Wisniewski said. 
“You want to give [new residents] options so they don’t have to bring a car,” he said.

The buddy-cop comedy genre welcomes its latest addition with this hilarious, over-the-top, but endearingly profane film from director Paul Feig ("Bridesmaids").
"The Heat" stars Sandra Bullock ("The Blind Side") as an uptight but intelligent FBI agent and Melissa McCarthy ("The Hangover Part III") as her foul-mouthed, but equally competent, Boston detective partner.
FBI Special Agent Sarah Ashburn (Bullock) is up for a promotion but her boss Agent Hale (Demian Bichir, "Savages") clarifies to her that no one in their department likes her because of her lack of teamwork and know-it-all attitude.
When she is assigned to work on a case to take down a Russian drug lord, she heads to Boston where she reluctantly partners up with Detective Shannon Mullins, played by McCarthy, whose co-workers are afraid of her offensively profane demeanor and her reckless attitude.
The plot moves quickly through the drug case, but it occasionally slows down to give us strong character development, particularly for Agent Ashburn, who progresses from an arrogant detective to a softer and more personable character. 
Mullins' roughness, meanwhile, becomes more understandable once the audience is introduced to her similarly rough-edged family.
While Katie Dippold's ("Parks and Recreation") script doesn't reinvent the genre, the film is aided by the tremendous chemistry between Bullock and McCarthy, each of them balancing the other's strengths and weaknesses. 
McCarthy's work here is hilarious, but has a tendency to stretch out the jokes that she borders on becoming obnoxious were it not for Bullock's ability to ground her ridiculousness.
On the other hand, Bullock often appears to be a caricature rather than a real person. McCarthy's outlandish detective gives Bullock's iciness enough contrast that we can understand Agent Ashburn's exasperation.
Also, a boon to the film's success is Fieg's scene direction. The film editing is so smooth even as the action ramps up, except for one scene in the latter part of the film that contained laughably obvious visual effects. 
The music choices are particularly keen and don't get in the way of the film's best jokes. Many of the laughs the film earns comes from the simultaneous verbal and visual jokes thrown at you. One in particular sticks to mind- midway through the film, Ashburn and Cullins enter a club to get a target and while Ashburn tries to dance with their target, Cullins manhandles the other girls away.
"The Heat" sometimes goes for the lame joke on Boston accents, spandex and some throwaway gross-out humor that it could do without, but otherwise there are plenty of jokes that are sharp and funny.
Thus, "The Heat" will probably end up becoming one of the highlights of summer 2013.

Martin Luther King Jr. famously said from a jail cell in Birmingham, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." 
In a simple and concise manner, it articulates the notion that all men are equal and should have a universal interest in each other's well-being and that incidences of injustice shouldn't be looked at as isolated incidents, but as actions that are helping to shape what is viewed as acceptable in our society. 
With this in mind, I want to talk about the Palestinian / Israeli conflict. What's interesting about this conflict is that while the United States continues to use violations of United Nations regulations as a pretext to rally international action against other foreign countries such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria, we as a nation continually underplay the fact that Israel is in violation of multiple international laws. 
To give a brief overview for those who aren't familiar with this, Israel's admittance as a U.N. member state was under the condition that it abide by general assembly resolution 194 calling for the right to return and compensation for Palestinians. A condition it still hasn't fulfilled. The U.N., in addition to the International Criminal Court, have repeatedly ruled that Israel's naval blockade, separation wall and settlement programs are in violation of international law. 
Israel has also been determined by the U.N. to be an occupying force in Gaza which make its treatment of Palestinians there, including it's extra-judicial killings of military and political figures, illegal. Recently, the U.N. released a report detailing how Israel Defense Forces coerce abused children to open bags suspected of containing explosives at gunpoint and even use them as human shields.
You might be wondering why I'm listing Israel's international crimes without addressing those of the Palestinians. My point is not to demonize Israel. My intention is to highlight the point that people are aware that Hamas has violated international law, but not many are aware of the scope and gravity of Israel's crimes. As a democratically elected political party, Hamas has routinely labeled terrorists, their government is de-legitimized and they also face sanctions and blacklisting. Yet many people are unaware that Israel routinely violates international law and Israel only faces minimal international pressure for it's violations of international law. 
It can't be denied that this is a complex situation whose resolution will extend far beyond the admittance of wrongdoings on both sides. However, it simply cannot stand that we continue to ignore the rulings of our international governing bodies when it comes to states that our government favors. At the very least, our country needs to acknowledge that Israel has a lot to account for in this conflict. Contemporarily we are setting a dangerous precedent. We are showing that it is okay to violate international law as long as you are, or have the backing of, a superpower. ?
Matthew Farrell is an incoming senior in the School of International Service
