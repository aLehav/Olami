• I loved being home until tonight, Christmas Eve. I fought with my mom over the stupidest thing and now she barely wants anything to do with me. I had a moment of weakness and cut myself for the first time in months. Happy holidays to me.
• Doctor Who is ruining my life. I can't stop watching it because it's brilliant, but I'm in the post-season two depression stage.
• @"WHY IS EVERY HARDCORE LIBERTARIAN I MEET SO PERSONALLY IMMORAL?" - That's interesting, the few I've met here are to me more likeable than many of my fellow liberals. (Shoutout to the libertarians from Letts 3N last year)
• @A woman on Reddit 
I'm a gay lady on reddit too! I'm sensing a trend...
• i love you, dont kill yourself please 
• Speaking as a guy, I would never be unfaithful to a girl and I would never willingly help a girl cheat on her boyfriend either. If I found out that crap was going on, I'd lose all interest in you immediately. You can dump your boyfriend if you want to (sounds like he deserves it), but you should be honest with people about your relationship status.
• Person with the brother, you sound like a good person. Hope everything gets better for you two. :/ 
• Pot smoking hedonists? This makes me want to be a libertarian even more!
• Yeah... my brother relapsed a day later.  Sucks.  I had hope after the emergency room since he seemed so much happier, but I guess he just doesn't want to be sober right now.  The hardest thing about it is that I know he's suffering and every instinct I has says that I need to help him, but there's literally nothing I can do if he doesn't want to be sober.
• What does everyone think about putting a Cosi where the McDonalds used to be?
• Dear fellow ranters: I would like to just say that I love AU and am really glad that I have the opportunity to go here! To all those who are having a tough time this holiday: please hang in there! The season is tough but the pain you're going through now will make spring so much sweeter. PLEASE do not hurt yourselves–even if you think you're alone, you're not (you have your fellow ranters, at least)! Things will get better <3
• Thanks, Editor, for still putting rants up during the holidays. Props! 
• The only person to wish me Merry Christmas was the automatic text from Words With Friends.
• TO THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KILL THEMSELVES/OD: DON'T. Someone out there cares. I care. Please, please. Talk to someone you trust. It will get better, I swear to you, I've been in a similar place, you just need to know that it will get better, and take active steps to help yourself. Go to the counseling centre. Please. 
• I have so much anxiety that I can't get through more than a few pages of the new book I just got on conquering anxiety. Oh irony..
• I flew home for Christmas even though I didn't want to and I could have stayed with my bf instead. But I went home because my dad wanted me to. I get home for Christmas and none of my siblings even came over to see me. FML
• Reddit is a magical land of internet awesomeness, full of hilarious, witty people (and yes-just like everything in life-occasional downers and trolls). It's got a "front page" where the most popular stuff culminates, and then a ton of "subreddits" to fit what you enjoy, ex) "Awww" for cute things, or "WTF" for crazy weird stuff, news, pics, videos, politics, etc..go check it out.
• whoever responded with the "come" pun in response to the film porn club....seeing as I was going to use that same response, I tip my hat to you good sir, you clever bastard.
• @”Home for the holidays (in the boondocks) and the nearest guy on grindr is 56 years old and 7 miles away…”  Although I’m not in the boonies, I’m back home to a grindr of mostly uneducated, poser @$$hole guidos, so there’s that. I feel your pain.
• I want to feel your heart beat inside of me
• “I’m scared I’m going to kill myself over break. Trying to hold on but the gnawing pain in my heart won’t go away. Help?”  No one should ever feel scared in his or her own body.  You control so much of your life, you really do have the power to change things.  Please please please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 if it gets really serious.  Or, talk to anyone-a parent, a neighbor, a friend, a coworker…it’ll surprise you how many people really truly care for you.
• Whoever you are with the detoxing brother-you're an awesome person and an even better brother.  Friends come and go--sure you could have been partying somewhere like those kids across the street--but family lasts forever.  Props to you for helping your brother through a difficult time. 
• I totally fell in love with the girl who cut my hair today.  And then I forgot to tip her.
• I think I'll start talking to girls.  What is the point of being completely awesome and hilarious and really really really ridiculously good looking if I don't talk to anyone?
• I feel bad for the basketball players...they only got four days off from this whole  entire break. I plan on going to the first home game when we come back from break. who's with me? :) 
• @I really want to ask the cute dance team girl from across the hall out to coffee on Nov. 5 you probably should ;) hahaha yes, I am that bored that I went  all the way back to November rants...
• What does it mean if i enjoyed high school way more than I enjoy college right now?
• Drunk snapchat is the best snapchat. 
• When did you become such a shallow, self-centered, groupie? It's like I don't even know you anymore. When we met I admired how you didn't care what people thought of you. Now all you seem to care about is feeling popular and "in" with your friend group, since you never had that in high school. Why don't you think about the choices you're making before you keep going down this road. You can stop anytime, you just have to want to live a moral life. You used to think that personal integrity and values matter. What happened to you?
• Russian women are finnneee!
• Surgeries suck :'(
• If you are suicidal, seek help from a therapist. Preferably one that does Cognitive Behavioral therapy (because that's the best kind of therapy), but any therapist will do. Whatever problems you have are fixable, you just need some support. When you're back at AU, visit the counciling center.
• Whoever posted "And by “sex” I mean me putting my arm around you and you squirming away because you just wanna stay friends" Dude I legitimately lol'd. 
I've come to realize that although it's not always obvious, but there are some pretty f'ing funny people at this school. Wit. I like it.  Can the funny people be more outgoing? We'd all benefit.
• Unfortunately, short guys finish last.
• that awkward moment when you realize that everyone in your new town knows what you have been doing at college and not one of them is your friend on FB...
• I'm scared to come back to AU after abroad. It just seems so terrible now.
• I don't even want to go back to school because I have to spend hours in a room with my whole sorority and some of them are awful people.
• @"I’m scared I’m going to kill myself over break." Please, please, PLEASE don't do it. Find professional help and figure out why you're feeling like this (or if you know why, figure out why it's driven you to this point).
• And this Monday/Tuesday will mark the 22nd year I haven't had a New Years Kiss. Or a kiss at all.
• Last night I had a dream that someone raped one of my friends and stalked her afterwards.  The legal system couldn't stop him, so I killed him to give her peace.  I was sentenced to prison, and inside I killed another inmate because he was plotting to harm a guard.  Once I was released I felt like there was evil in the world that I had a duty to stop, but I came to the conclusion that I was really just a serial killer justifying my murderous needs with that mentality.  So I killed myself.  How f***ed is that?
• So on Christmas Eve, I was mugged. Well, mugged might be kind of inaccurate. It wasn't violent, but a person ran up to me and grabbed my bag and ran away. My phone, camera, money and key were in there. There's nothing to be done but I can't stop dwelling on it. It's not my fault but, I can't help blaming myself. Like, I could have been more careful or something. I've never felt so powerless. It's sh*tty.
• packingpackingpackingpacking
• I used to live in a psychic city
• This one time I was peeing next to a guy and I was all like "Yo,bro, don't cross the streams." And He's all like "Whatevah, bro namith." And he did and it exploded and that's how the universe was made. 
• I Le Jizzed during Le Miz. Now I'm under Le house arrest. 
• An alumni just told me that AU used to be a party school when they went hahahahah well, times have certainly changed! but for real, did it used to be?
• @"Sorry, but I actually kind of hate christmas."
Merry Les Christrables!
• @" I’m scared I’m going to overdose and no one will even care. "
I overdosed on pizza, now I am a pizza. Where's Kevin Spacey? 
• I HATE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS! 
• It doesn't make for a good night when an unknown number starts texting you every half hour to say that your brother's hallucinating, crying, talking to people who aren't there, and lighting french fries like cigarettes.  Whoever it is wants to know what to do.  Luckily, I've had a crash course in that the past few weeks.
• Ughhh Fraternity rush is approaching!! I just want to go PIKE but I don't think they like me. Maybe I flirt with them to much?
• Why can't I just tell this kid that I'm not interested?! He's been in the friend zone for like 5 years now, but I don't think he knows and that makes me feel bad. But I don't know how to let him down easily, other than talking about my boyfriend to him. Which isn't even working. UGH!
• @• My peanus has never been kissed. Do you vvant to kiss my peanus with your mouth?-- You are a moron.
• @• My brother just came upstairs and asked if anyone was taking parts of the wall away, and whether any of my sisters friends have been doing work on the house. I said no to both, obviously, and then he went back to the basement again. I literally feel sick to my stomach." Context?
• @How terrible is it for me to just pretend I’m single on okcupid?-- Your boyfriend is an ass and clearly doesn't care about you enough or he wouldn't want it to be open. It's not fair for him to be able to have other partners but he expects you not to- that's a classic double standard. You can find a much better guy, trust me. I know of some people who prefer open relationships, but they (in my opinion) tend to be selfish and really just self-interested people primarily concerned with their own gratification. 
• @• I’m feeling sick, so now I’m going to go the line for Santa Clause at the mall and spread as many germs as possible.  &@&# everyone up real bad before Christmas.-- At first I found myself thinking 'wow you're a terrible person', and then I realized I was laughing hysterically at the hilarity of it. Am I a sadist now?
• @Why can I only talk to people when I’m drunk?:
1) something happened to you which makes it hard for you to let loose around people without alcohol in you?
2) low confidence from any number of sources, including possible emotional or psychological trauma?
3) guilt over something unresolved on your end?
(most likely) you just might be a bit shy. Surround yourself with people who love you and who inspire you to be a better person.
•  That's why her hair is so big, it's full of secrets. 
• And I want my pink shirt back! I want my pink shirt back! 
• Taylor Zimmermann, two for you. Glenn Coco? FOUR for you, Glenn Coco! You go, Glenn Coco!
• I have this theory, that if you cut off all her hair she'd look like a British man. 
• It's not that I don't want to talk to you anymore. Don't hate me. You just aren't moral enough for me, sorry. You've taken your values and turned them upside down just to fit in and feel like you belong. You were a better person when we first met. Look at your life choices.
• I like this guy but I think he still likes his ex a lot. She treated him terribly in the end, and I'd never treat him like that. How can I show him that I'll love him for who he is and never hurt him? He says he's afraid of trusting again.
• @single on okcupid: Um.. better make that single thing permanent. If this guy doesn't respect you enough to make it a mutual open relationship, or listen to what you want, then you should get out of it. You're worth more than that. 
• lol, all you angry white folks start a damn "caucasian club" already. what would your activities be? playing croquet and eating egg salad sandwiches with the young republicans? or is that...RACIST!?!111
