	Coming off a decisive 59-43 loss to first place Colgate University, the Eagles are looking to rebound against Lehigh University on Feb.12. With only six games left in the regular season, every game is pivotal in securing a favorable position in the Patriot League tournament.

	Currently the Eagles will enter the Patriot League tournament as the fourth seed. AU stands to host the fifth seed in the quarterfinals if the standings hold. Due to the parity in the league, only one game separates the Eagles from hosting a playoff game and traveling to play in the tournament.
AU (13-11, 6-6 PL) is presently looking up at Colgate (12-14, 9-4 PL), Bucknell (14-12, 9-4 PL), and Lehigh (13-10, 7-5 PL) in the standing while fighting off three teams, Loyola (6-7, 10-14 PL), Lafayette (14-10, 6-7 PL), BU (10-14, 6-7 PL), who are just one game behind in the loss column.
 After a season on the road, The Eagles will finish the year playing four of their last six games at home. American has a 6-1 record at Bender Arena. The road has taken a toll on the team, as the Eagles have compiled a 5-10 record in enemy territory.

	In facing the third place Lehigh Mountain Hawks, the Eagles have a significant opportunity to gain ground in the Patriot League standings. The last meeting between the two teams finished with senior guard Darius “Pee-Wee” Gardner draining a 3-pointer to beat the buzzer, handing AU the 62-59 win.



	Led by sophomore center Tim Kempton, Lehigh has been on a tear, winning six of their last seven games. The 6-foot-10-inch reigning Patriot League rookie of the year recorded a double-double in his previous game against the Eagles, scoring 24 points and pulling down 13 rebounds. With the significant injuries the Eagles frontcourt it will be difficult to stop or even contain Kempton. It will be senior center Kevin Panzer’s responsibility to guard the rim, but if the big man gets into foul trouble head coach Mike Brennan will be forced to put an overmatched 6-foot-5-inch Marko Vasic on Kempton. Conceivably freshman 7-foot center Gabe Brown can get a look if the circumstances are right.

	While Lehigh has found it’s groove since their last meeting, AU has hit a wall losing four of their last six games. Offensive inconsistencies, second half slumps and a lack of rebounds has plagued the Eagles down the stretch.

	As AU attempts to find its footing, sophomore forward Charlie Jones and junior forward Marko Vasic have emerged. Jones has developed into an real offensive threat leading the team in shooting percentage (55 percent) and averaging 7.8 points per game game. While Brennan scarcely uses his bench, he has found a high energy, 50 percent shooting sixth man in Vasic.

	The Eagles will finally return to Bender Arena for a matchup against Lafayette on Feb. 14.

Despite a slow start, AU was able to bounce back and secure a crucial Patriot League victory to keep its slim lead atop the conference standings in tact. The Eagles rallied from an 11-point deficit down midway through the half to built up a 17-point second half lead en route to defeating the Lehigh University Mountain Hawks, 74-65.
The Eagles celebrated Play4Kay night at Bender Arena, honoring former North Carolina State basketball coach Kay Yow who passed away from cancer six years ago. Members of the AU women’s team wore pink socks, and coaches from both teams wore pink in order to raise awareness for breast cancer and raise funds for cancer research. Students also participated in a bra-decorating contest to help support the cause, and the four winning student groups received a $50 donation to the Kay Yow foundation in their name. 
In their first meeting against the Mountain Hawks on Dec. 31, the Eagles needed five points from senior guardShaquilla Curtis in the final 65 seconds of regulation to force overtime and ultimately notch a 75-73 victory in their Patriot League opener. Strong play from senior guard Jen Dumiak and senior forward Arron Zimmerman ensured there would be no late-game drama at Bender Arena this time.
Dumiak led the Eagles (16-8, 11-2 PL) with 21 points, nine assists and eight rebounds, and  Zimmerman poured in 19 points with 12 of those points coming in the second half. The Eagles started the game poorly from the field, making only two of their first eight field goal attempts. Meanwhile, the Mountain Hawks (16-7, 8-5 PL) were efficient in the early going, converting on six of their first 11 shots while building a 15-4 lead. 
“I think we started out a little frantic and out of sync, and once we got ourselves back in sync, I think things worked a lot better for us,” head coach Megan Gebbia said.
The Eagles struggled to find their footing in the game and trailed by 11 at the 12:49 mark in the first half. A three-point field goal by sophomore guard Jordan Light ignited the AU offense, and the Eagles slowly started chipping away at the Mountain Hawk lead. After Dumiak rattled off six consecutive points late in the first half, the Eagles pulled within two points. The teams then traded baskets as the half wound down before a three-pointer by Curtis tied the game at 31.
Lehigh attempted multiple different defensive sets to try and disrupt the Patriot League’s second highest scoring offense. The Mountain Hawks deployed a one-three-one zone, a three-quarter court press and man-to-man defenses in addition to trying to trap Eagles ball handlers on the sidelines. Gebbia credited Dumiak for her ability to adjust to the different defenses employed by Lehigh.
“Jen’s at the helm, seeing the floor and knowing where people are rotating to. You’ve just got to give her a lot of credit because she is very patient when the ball is in her hands,” Gebbia said. “When you do that and are able to play under control, you are going to find open people.” 
Dumiak’s ability to distribute the ball was a key element to the Eagles’ 12-2 run to start the second half. Dumiak delivered assists on two early Zimmerman three-point field goals that helped AU take its first lead and gain control of the game. The Eagles shot 53.1 percent from the field after halftime and were able to build a 17-point lead with 7:22 left in the game. 
The Eagles leave Bender Arena for their next two games, beginning with a trip to Lafayette at 2 p.m. on Feb. 14.
