• Why do we have a stupid ranting website? Stop judging.
• 4 Eagle rants this past week?
Pathetic!
• My boyfriend is on an outing (i.e. "date") with his stalker girl. He thinks this is a good idea. I think this is the beginning of a big disaster.
• So there is still no button on the eagle website that says, "submit anonymous sex question here.” Disappointment.
[Editor’s Note: You can submit anonymous sex questions via a form at the bottom of the most recent sex column.]
• Not only does my grad school not have Eagle Rants. They don't even have a school newspaper. Major fail.
• I really miss AU this summer.
But one thing I don't miss is walking around the beautiful campus only to be assaulted by toxic smoke fumes from inconsiderate students who like to subject others to the consequences of their poor life choices.
• I really want a baby.
• Being around my dog = major plus.
Being around my step-dad = major negative.
• Can AU have a support group for kids from dysfunctional families? I feel very sad whenever I see all the happy AU students on the phone with their mom or dad saying I love you.
• It's really sad that my city's newspaper website crashes more than my college newspaper's website.
• Am I the only girl in SOC who hasn't had a nose job?
• Can we please replace "Salsa" with Chipotle? K thanks.
• My head is throbbing. I think I have a nuclear bomb inside my pituitary gland.
• Don't laugh at me because I still watch Disney Channel at age 24. Disney Channel rocks. But it doesn't even begin to compare to Toon Disney Channel.
• Periods suck.
• I think my gf gets crazier by the day. I'm scared.
• I am so ready to be rescued by Prince Charming right about now.
• AU's new Korean garden ROCKS!
• Can AU please replace the benches in ward with soft couches? My tushy is sore from the lack of softness.
• All my friends are working this summer … so bored … =( can't hang out with anyone "sigh"
• "Holla to the people who would rather enhance their mind with classes at AU over the summer than get “work experience” bringing someone coffee."
This is funny, because I am spending this summer doing both XP
• Getting no work-study blows. Thanks financial aid, it's not like college is expensive or anything.
• Whoever wrote "Thank god school is out. Now I have an opportunity to meet men that are taller 5’4” and not Jewish."
I love you so much. This could not be anymore true.
• I cannot stand the inability of people to understand the verdict on the Casey Anthony trial. I hope I am never suspected of a crime. No one seems to know the difference between the constitution and their emotions!
If there is no evidence PROVING a crime, you cannot LEGALLY convict a person of said crime.
I am so happy to be a journalism major! Maybe I can shed light on this fact!
