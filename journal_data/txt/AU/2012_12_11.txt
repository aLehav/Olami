The AU administration and Bon Appétit have an opportunity to be pioneers in sustainability by embracing their stated promises to fresh food, building community and social responsibility through committing to the Real Food Real Job principles.
Over 100 students, faculty and food-service workers delivered this message to Bon Appétit management on the afternoon of Dec. 8, in a powerful display of solidarity and passion. The delegation was part of the Real Food Real Jobs campaign, which encourages students and workers to envision a more healthy, sustainable and just community at AU, in D.C. and across the globe. Workers want respect and the ability to speak out about sustainability and safety issues while cooking and serving fresh food that students enjoy.
Now is the time for Bon Appétit to stand up for their principles of building community and a sustainable food system, which means respect for the environment and human beings. The AU administration also has a responsibility to ensure that the companies they hire follow the values and ethics of our community. After all, students' tuition dollars fund the University. AU cannot evade its responsibility for providing students with quality food and protecting the human rights of workers on campus.
The over 1,000 people who signed the Real Food Real Jobs pledge are a symbol of the tremendous support for good jobs and healthy food, and they are ready to hold Bon Appétit accountable.

You may have more in common with your member of Congress than you think, especially around this time of year. Students and lawmakers alike want to finish up the year and head home for the holidays. But there’s a final exam standing between Congress and the holidays, and America’s citizens are ready to give the body an “F” if it doesn’t pass.
That exam is coming in the form of the “fiscal cliff” - the combination of arbitrary, automatic, across-the-board spending cuts and tax increases coming at the end of the year that could cripple the economy. It all started last year when Congress picked 12 of its members to try to find a deal to secure America’s long-term financial future. Consumer confidence had dropped dramatically, and a credit ratings agency dropped our country’s rating.
It seemed the only thing that could make members of both parties work across the aisle was an alternative so terrible it would be untenable to both parties.
That alternative is coming closer to reality, and unfortunately, it is your generation that will have to pay the highest price.
The Congressional Budget Office has predicted that if we do not avoid the fiscal cliff, the $7 trillion combination of spending cuts and tax increases could send the economy hurtling back into recession for years to come. Unemployment, especially among young people, will rise even further. Education will suffer among the harshest spending cuts, losing about $4.8 billion in funding.
Our leaders have had more than three years to address these issues. Imagine if you had that long to prepare for a test. Yet rather than hunkering down in the library, or in their case the Capitol Building, to solve this crisis, leaders of each side avoid meeting to talk about potential solutions.
We need real solutions. These solutions begin with both parties understanding they need to work together to stave off this crisis. No Labels, a growing grassroots movement of hundreds of thousands of Republicans, Democrats and independents is working to facilitate cooperation. Since last year, we’ve been advocating for leaders in all negotiations to put everything on the table and ensure all interested parties are at the table. You can be a part of this movement and sign on at NoLabels.org
These solutions can also help fix the underlying problem: the way Washington does business. We need to find real and permanent ways for our leaders to come together to govern for the future because our nation’s financial situation is not the only problem America faces. We need our leaders to come together and find solutions in immigration, energy and infrastructure policy. As Washington’s current stalemate has shown, we can’t afford to wait for Congress to find bold, pragmatic across-the-aisle solutions.
Changing Washington won’t happen quickly. But even you would have a hard time cramming three years' worth of work into one night. What we can do now is commit ourselves, and hold our elected officials accountable, to the idea that progress is only made when our common national interest is the priority. That is what No Labels is all about.

The tag line on the poster for writer-director Andrew Dominik’s crime thriller “Killing Them Softly” reads as follows: “In America, you’re on your own.”
An alternate tag line might read thusly: “Brad Pitt: Charming even while he’s shooting people in cold blood.”
Indeed, the perfectly coiffed actor and his facial hair turn in impressive star performances in this violent exploration of corruption and murder’s emotional toll. The movie proves engrossing and occasionally quite disturbing despite the lack of a recognizable structure.
Dominik, who previously directed Pitt in “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,” crafts an unexpectedly vivid critique of American capitalism, ironically interweaving footage from 2008’s presidential campaign speech to subtly comment on America’s flawed economic system. Concurrently, Dominik derives tension and shock value from a plot filled with crimes of many colors.
As the film opens, two thieves (Scott McNairy, “Argo,” and Ben Mendelsohn, “The Dark Knight Rises”) and their dimwitted employer (Vincent Curatola, “The Sopranos”) upset the New Orleans crime scene’s apple cart when they rob a mob-protected card game, inciting the fury of the game’s organizer Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta, “Bad Karma”). Pitt’s Jackie Cogan is a hit man assigned by the reserved “Driver” (the reliably excellent Richard Jenkins, “The Cabin in the Woods”) to “take care of” the two thieves, aided by his troubled former partner Mickey (James Gandolfini, “The Sopranos”). Plentiful blood, tears and profanities ensue.
The film is largely dialogue-driven with bursts of discomfiting graphic violence often arriving at unexpected moments and depicted in explicit detail. Dominik lightens the mood and generates strong irony by juxtaposing the death scares with eerily cheerful music, an echo of Cogan’s eponymous policy of killing his victims “softly,” without emotional attachment. This device simultaneously strengthens the film’s themes while making for a less uncomfortable viewing experience.
Despite the brisk 94-minute running time, the plot frequently grinds to a halt, allowing the characters an opportunity to converse and argue extensively. The absence of abundant plot mechanics renders the film slightly disjointed, suggesting that Dominik occasionally indulges his obvious aesthetic prowess at the expense of narrative momentum. But the film overcomes occasional dull moments to demonstrate well-ratcheted suspense coupled with subtle political musings.
As mentioned, Pitt commands the screen with his cynical character, who manages to remain sympathetic on the strength of the beloved actor’s unending charm, familiar looks and roguish wit. His performance is quietly impressive rather than obvious or grandiose. Meanwhile, Gandolfini is devastating and soulful as the shameless alcoholic with too much power and not enough control, and McNairy and Mendelsohn make for an amusingly oblivious odd couple. In fact, the performances are satisfying down to the minor roles.
Perhaps “Killing Them Softly” should be praised most strongly for maintaining a potent sense of dark humor throughout. An overly solemn approach to this outsized crime story with a political tinge might have seemed overwrought. Thanks to the presence of a powerful leading man, sharp dialogue and an impressive aesthetic, “Killing Them Softly” commits few crimes.

Several scenes in “Silver Linings Playbook,” David O. Russell’s new blend of comedy, drama and romance, start in one place and end in quite another, both literally and figuratively. A casual dinner of Raisin Bran and tea turns into a heated but darkly funny altercation on a city street. A heavily foreshadowed reunion proves to be underwhelming for both characters involved. An opening scene set in a state institution promises a goofy, cliché-ridden comedy mockery of mental illness that never arrives.
But “Silver Linings Playbook” is more than just a slightly off-kilter dramedy or an unconventional romance. This movie has a unique energy derived from Russell’s sensitive, sometimes devastating dialogue and sensational performances by Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro. Occasionally, the oscillating tone is more off-putting than intriguing, but the movie elicits an emotional impact by focusing on its interesting relationships.
In a performance that has already attracted deserving Oscar buzz for an actor recently perceived as an acting lightweight, Cooper plays Pat Solitano, an undiagnosed bipolar recently released from an eight-year stint in a mental institution after an incident involving his wife’s infidelity. Upon returning home to live with his mother Delores (Jacki Weaver, “Animal Kingdom”) and father Pat Sr. (DeNiro (“Being Flynn”), wonderful and touching as a man with an unhealthy Philadelphia Eagles obsession), Pat refocuses his energy on attempting to win back his beloved wife Nikki. In doing so, Pat meets a young woman named Tiffany (Lawrence, “The Hunger Games”), with whom he experiences a strange, indescribable, perhaps toxic connection. The two form a reluctant, unconventional partnership.
In generic action thrillers like “Limitless” and “The A-Team,” Cooper’s wispy voice and blue eyes underwhelm. Here, though, the actor excels at the lengthy monologues, the verbal comedy beats and the silent moments of wariness in equal measure, never lapsing into melodrama or caricature. In this case, strong writing brings out the best in an often mediocre actor.
Lawrence may even outshine Cooper, though. She portrays the outwardly strong-willed, inwardly uncertain Tiffany with a deft mixture of shrewdness and vulnerability that is impressive even in the character’s unappealing moments. Tiffany isn’t always an admirable character, but she’s always an interesting one. Lawrence proves herself as a formidable actress with an impressive range.
In the supporting realm, DeNiro brings a wry inevitability to his character, an ambitious father who needs his son as much as his son needs him, and Chris Tucker makes a delightful big-screen comeback as Pat’s institution mate Danny, an unexpectedly delightful source of comedic relief. The talented Weaver, unfortunately, is given little to do.
“Silver Linings Playbook” has a peculiar rhythm that won’t suit everyone. The dialogue is frequently elliptical and impressively subtle, and the tone oscillates unpredictably between dark comedy and genuine emotional pain. Rather than mocking its characters, many of whom are pathetic and blinded by their own neuroses, director Russell’s empathetic script highlights the difficulties associated with attempting to change. As mentioned, Pat’s bouts of unpredictable behavior serve to illuminate his unique character rather than render him a one-dimensional stereotype, and characters like Tiffany and Pat’s father reveal themselves to be more layered than initial impressions might suggest. Nonetheless, the movie is not above resorting to some unsurprising plot points that prove somewhat disappointing in their banality.
“Silver Linings Playbook” is a movie to be enjoyed primarily for its terrific acting. Russell’s writing and directing are sharp but not showy, and the comedy and drama are appealingly combined. The real silver lining, though, is in the performances.

The story itself does not matter. It’s the act of storytelling itself that brings people together.
This sentiment is at the heart of director Ang Lee’s “Life of Pi,” a beguiling, bewildering and occasionally frustrating film about a young boy named Pi who survives a shipwreck, lives with a tiger on a rickety raft and recounts his story to an aspiring writer during the film’s slightly unwieldy two hours.
While “Life of Pi,” based on a 2001 bestselling novel by Yann Martel, is undeniably beautiful with occasional moments of visual transcendence, its appeal is challenging and its subtlety questionable.
Following a delightful opening montage featuring a mélange of beautifully realized zoo animals, the movie establishes its framing device. A struggling author (Rafe Spall, “Prometheus”) arrives at the doorstep of a kindly man named Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan, “The Amazing Spiderman”), claiming that Pi’s friend promised that a story from Pi’s childhood would confirm the author’s belief in God.
The conversation between these two men frames the central narrative, in which young Pi earns his arithmetic nickname, explores his father’s zoo and survives the aforementioned shipwreck along with many of his fellow zoo animals. As Pi, now a teenager (Suraj Sharma, an impressively charismatic young newcomer) becomes increasingly desperate for food and basic comfort in the middle of the ocean, he forges an unexpectedly complex companionship with his fearsome tiger companion Richard Parker. (The tiger’s anthropomorphized name is one of several sources of welcome comic relief.)
With an estimated budget of $120 million, “Life of Pi” is a triumph of sweeping design, vibrant colors and compelling landscapes. The animals feel tactile and genuinely threatening, and the vast, lonely seascapes are gorgeously realized. The visual design also complements the story’s overall sense of dreamy surrealism. In the film’s standout sequence, a fearsome storm topples an enormous ship, tossing the characters across the gargantuan waves. Lee makes these events feel suspenseful and high-stakes without compromising the sequence’s coherence.
Possibly by design, the movie never looks particularly lifelike, in keeping with the idea that fiction or nonfiction, stories are moving on a fundamental level. Even the 3-D, while hardly necessary and characteristically clunky as well, occasionally provides a depth that elevates the movie’s grandeur.
“Life of Pi” also has ambitions beyond the purely aesthetic, but those elements are less satisfying. The dialogue occasionally sounds overly thematic, leaving a slight aftertaste of “touchy-feely” sentiment. In particular, the scenes between Khan and Spall seem obviously designed for maximum sentimental appeal, but they seem forced, partially because the author’s character is essentially a cipher.
Meanwhile, the central theme of storytelling as therapy suffers from a conclusion that seems to rush an important plot point involving a deceptive speech that Pi delivers to a pair of Japanese interviewers. By the end, the film feels like a bountiful visual feast coupled with a slightly perfunctory contemplation of spirituality and mythmaking.
Nonetheless, the film’s achievements are noteworthy. Only a director with a particular skill could make an hour of a boy sitting on a boat with a tiger into an exciting spectacle. With its solemn pace and occasional bouts of tedium, the filmmakers successfully avoid the temptation to transform this children’s fable into a sophomoric “laugh riot.” If only the script by David Magee (“Finding Neverland”) were tighter, the movie might have seemed less flabby and more substantial.
During the movie’s quietest scenes of human-animal interaction and spectacle, though, “Life of Pi” is transporting in exactly the way that adult Pi says stories should be. It’s thrilling and seems to mean something, but we don’t know what. And it doesn’t matter.

School of Communication adjunct professor Steve Piacente has released a prequel to his award-winning 2010 novel “Bella,” titled “Bootlicker.”
“Bella” is about a military widow who teams up with an investigative reporter to discover the truth behind her husband’s death.
Two years later, “Bella” has garnered popular acclaim and won the 2012 Readers Favorite Gold Medal for Dramatic Fiction. Piacente released “Bootlicker” on Sept. 29, featuring the same lead character Dan Patragno.
The prequel shifts the action to 1992, when Ike Washington, an African American candidate from South Carolina is poised to become the first black senator from that state since Reconstruction. Yet there lies a deep and disturbing secret that connects Ike and the senator that he is replacing.  
Piacente says the book is about “guilt, hope and redemption.” He said that he usually writes about what he knows but that “Bootlicker” was a different case.
“I’m interested in what people do when no one is watching,” Piacente said.
Piacente’s background is in print journalism. He graduated from SOC in 1976 (even serving as the arts editor of The Eagle), which led him to a 25-year career in newspapers. Despite his writing background, writing fiction was a different and more difficult process altogether.
“They’re very different, like driving a car 40 miles an hour, then throwing it into reverse,” Piacente said. “I found that over the years, the most interesting parts of stories never made it into the story.”
As for the future, Piacente said that he has made a transition from creative writing to creative marketing for his books. He also mentioned the possibility of a third book in order to tie up some loose ends in both “Bella” and “Bootlicker.”
