Afraid of clowns? Avoid watching the new season of “American Horror Story” on Wednesday nights. 
Jessica Lange, Angela Bassett, Kathy Bates, Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters return for what could be their big “AHS” finale. 
The fourth season, “Freak Show,” sends viewers down to the fictional Jupiter, Florida in the 1950s where a local freak show awaits. The premiere paints the eerie circus carnival as a refuge for the outcasted rejects of society from conjoined twins (Paulson, “12 Years a Slave”) and a boy with ectrodactyly (Peters, “X-Men: Days of Future Past”) to a woman with three breasts (Bassett, “Black Nativity”), a bearded lady (Bates, “Misery”) and so many more. The whole production is run by a German woman named Elsa (Lange, “Tootsie”) who yearns for an opportunity to shine in spotlight of the cabaret. 
Of course, being a “freak” is no paradise— everyone in town harrasses the carnies and accuses them of the serial murders that have been piling up in Jupiter. Despite their efforts to entertain the crowd through fear or fascination, they are all still perceived as monsters.

This season begins with genuinely interesting story lines unlike last season, “AHS: Coven.” Based on the premiere, there is more emphasis on suspense and action, but it wouldn’t be “AHS” without a complicated love triangle in the equation, accompanied by loads of dirty talk and freaky orgies. Lange already has a lot of wow worthy moments in the premiere, from her extravagant cover of David Bowie’s “Life on Mars” to her heartfelt speech about the beauty of monsters.
“I’ll tell you who the monsters are. The people outside this tent. In your town. In all these little towns. Housewives pinched with bitterness, stupefied with boredom, as they doze off in front of their laundry detergent commercials and dream of strange erotic pleasures. They have no souls,” she said. “My monsters—the ones you call depraved—they are the beautiful, heroic ones. They offer their oddity to the world.”
Overall, this is executive producer Ryan Murphy’s grim tale about show business and what happens behind the curtains. It also presents a warped reality of exploitation and marginalization in society. This sense of otherness is something that viewers will undoubtedly be able to identify with as the episodes progress. 
The best part about the new season of “AHS” is that it’s actually scary again! Prepare to be hiding behind couches and re-experiencing suppressed nightmares from childhood— on a scare scale of one to 10, this might be 20 times worse than “Are You Afraid Of The Dark.” 
Watching everything unfold is similar to winding up a Jack-N-The-Box, except there’s no telling where and when the toy will pop out. Good luck trying to escape from Twisty (John Carroll Lynch, “Shutter Island”) the creepy clown that stabs people to death with his props, kidnaps children and locks them in cages with a sinister smile on his bloody face.
‘Tis the season for a good scare with Halloween being around the corner and all! Watching AHS alone might not be an option though.

Tune in to “American Horror Story: Freak Show” on Wednesdays at 10 p.m. on FX.

Every other week, this column will review ways and places to eat healthy in D.C. 
Where To Try
After a good workout, one of the most rewarding things you can do is get a delicious, healthy meal to satisfy your post-workout hunger. D.C. is a prime place to find great, healthy meals regardless of your taste. After trying Sweetgreen once, it’s easy to get obsessed. After a second time, it’s the only place you will want to eat. Sweetgreen offers seasonal specials, create-your-own items and a variety of year round favorites to choose from. Check out its menu and locations at its website for more information. 
What To Try

ARIELLE WEG, THE EAGLE
During the summer time, Sweetgreen offers an incredible watermelon, feta and mint salad. The salad contains the obvious ingredients plus heirloom tomatoes, kale, arugula, mint, sunflower seeds, cucumbers and champagne vinaigrette. The kale and arugula base is fantastic and added a crisp bite to the salad, with just the right level of bitterness. The watermelon and feta combination, both locally produced, was incredible; It’s easily a match made in heaven. Sweetgreen provided a hearty helping of the salad, perfectly sufficient for a meal. This salad is highly recommended during summer time when watermelon is at its peak, but can be recreated with the make your own salad option.

ARIELLE WEG, THE EAGLE
One of the incredible year round salads that Sweetgreen offers is the Harvest Bowl. This salad includes organic wild brown rice, shredded kale, apples, sweet potatoes, toasted almonds, local goat cheese, roasted chicken and balsamic vinaigrette. The rice would seem to be heavy and starchy but actually had an incredible hearty, nutty flavor that mixed well with the bitter, leafy kale. The apples were crunchy and helped make the salad sweet and fresh. The goat cheese, locally produced, was fresh and creamy; it really pulled the salad together. The salad can be ordered with or without the chicken (as pictured), and is still incredibly tasteful and packed with protein! 
Tips To Know
Sweetgreen offers light, medium or heavy dressing mixed into your salad. The medium choice seems to be the best option, adding just the right amount without overdoing it. Of course this depends on your taste, and you can always ask for it on the side. Sweetgreen also offers you bread to go with your salad. The bread is extremely hearty, whole grain bread and is a great addition to your meal – plus it’s free. 
During the fall months, you can go in and ask for a sample of their soups. The organic lentil chickpea soup is hearty, and a bowl of it is easily a sufficient meal for a cold night after the gym. 
Check out the menu online before you go because it can be overwhelming. They have seasonal additions and a create-your-own option, so knowing what you’re in for if it’s your first visit may help you make the best decision. Also, any salad can be altered, so if you want to make a salad vegetarian, feel free to ask for no chicken or substitute out anything you don’t like to make it unique.

There will be fewer events to celebrate this year’s LGBT History Month, but it is on purpose.
An overwhelming number of events aren’t necessary to have a strong, meaningful month of celebration, Coordinator of LGBTQ Programming Matthew Bruno said. Students and staff have planned events that include a film screening, coming out stories, awareness training and a coming out day.
“We are doing less events with more purpose this year,” Bruno said.  
This purpose includes bringing focus to the variety of identities and interests held in the LGBT community. Identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender doesn’t fully express every aspect of who that person is, and rigid definitions pigeonhole people, according to Bruno.
Since LGBT club members are involved with a variety of campus organizations, Bruno said he encouraged these campus groups to co-sponsor events to help spotlight identity diversity.
One of Bruno’s favorite events is the Coming Out Monologues. Currently in its fourth year, the event was held at the Perch on Oct. 8 at 8 p.m. and featured true stories of coming out by the AU community. The individual monologues highlight specific experiences, but elicit a breadth of understanding when heard as a whole, according to Bruno. 
“The monologues are so specific that it gives the audience a chance to realize we all experience our lives differently, even when we identify in the same group,” he said. 
Coming Out on the Quad, an event sponsored by AU Queers and Allies, was held on the quad last Thursday. LGBT community members and allies surrounded a free-standing door and frame while people walked through the door to celebrate coming out.
Lex Loro, executive director of AU Queers and Allies, said the event attracts hundreds of people each year and is always energetic and inspiring.
“It is very symbolic,” Loro said. “The act of walking through an actual door into a loving, supporting, cheering crowd is very powerful.”
The door frame was decorated with notes of love and support from the AU community. AU Queers and Allies collected messages to adorn the frame using the hashtag #AUComingOut.
Coming Out on the Quad and National Coming Out Day also celebrate members of the LGBT community who have not come out, Loro said. 
“We recognize not everyone is able to come out and that is okay,” Loro said. “We support every member of our community whether they come out now or not at all.”
Upcoming events include multiple workshops as well as the first Pride Welcome Reception hosted by AU Pride Alumni Alliance for the All-American Weekend. 
For those who aren’t able to attend this month’s events, Loro said there are other ways to celebrate and participate. 
Loro encourages LGBT allies to take a more active role in the community. To start, campus organizations should enroll in AU’s Safe Space and Trans 101 workshops. She also suggests coming to an HIV testing event or attending a Queer and Allies meeting.
“Celebrating and supporting the LGBT community doesn’t end in October,” Loro said.

All throughout October, The Synetic Theatre in Crystal City will perform “The Island of Dr. Moreau,” a dazzling play about compassion, ethics and the dangers of tinkering with biological science. Based on the H.G. Wells book, this play leaves a haunting warning to audiences that has already resonated throughout generations. 
As the H.G. Wells story goes, “man of science” Mr. Parker is shipwrecked on an island and is the only person on his crew to survive. He is found and nursed back to health by the brilliantly wicked, brutal and inquisitive Dr. Moreau and his assistant, Montgomery. Moreau, also a “man of science,” explains to Parker that he runs a biological compound on the island, engineering a new type of animal- or, a new type of human. Through his cruel, painful experiments, Moreau has created an advanced human-like animal form for the greater good of science, which leaves Parker mesmerized, horrified and enthralled — much like the audiences of the Synetic Theater’s stage adaptation of this novel.  
Director Paata Tsikurishvili, who also hauntingly plays Moreau, accurately captures the essence and significance of Parker and Moreau’s story. With a colorful set of characters that are impossible to love or hate outright, Wells’ story and the Synetic Theater’s production explores the danger of scientific advancement (a common theme in many of Wells’s novels), the ethics of tinkering with nature and the constant struggle for human empathy. The array of actors bring the characters to life, in all their glory and faults. 
The brilliant choreography leaves the audience mystified by Moreau’s beats. Incredible, colorful and imaginative costumes paint these beasts in an oddly endearing light. The show has enough passion to fuel any giant D.C. political protest, in the space of one Synetic Theater stage. 
If the actors and colorful set design doesn’t draw in guests, nothing will. “The Island of Dr. Moreau” is amazing, engaging and completely worth taking an afternoon to enjoy. 
“The Island of Dr. Moreau” will run from Oct. 1-Nov. 2 at the Synetic Theater in Crystal City, at 1800 S. Bell St. Tickets are $15 with a student ID.

Student Government President Sophia Wirth is currently campaigning to turn the third floor of the Mary Graydon Center into a space devoted to student life, with an overall goal of making MGC a student union building. 
The third floor previously housed the School of Communication before the opening of the new Mckinley building in the spring of 2014.
Currently the third floor of MGC is being used as “swing space” for displaced offices from construction on campus on the law campus and various other academic departments, according to Senior Director of the University Center & Student Activities Michael Elmore. 
Wirth’s short-term goal for the semester is to compose a report and present it to the administration on behalf of the student body, Wirth said. She hopes to lay down the foundations for the conversations about what will go on the third floor and more specifically in the student center.
“Our goal is to have confirmation from the University administration by the end of this year that the third floor will be given to student space,” Wirth said. 
Currently, Wirth’s progress has included talking with administration like Vice President for Campus Life Gail Hanson and focusing on ways to collect data that shows the need for a student union building
“[Hanson] has proven to be a real advocate in terms of student space and so we are hoping that the data that we have collected from the fall SG survey, along with qualitative and quantitative research that we have started to do with club leaders and other organizations,” Wirth said.
When the report and data are finalized Hanson will be the presenting the information to the University administration, which Wirth said cannot be done without proving student support. 
“We really need to organize all the student voices that are calling for this building to go to students so that the arguments for why the space is needed can be presented in a meaningful way,” Wirth said.
The data being presented will include a fall survey that was recently conducted asking students and club leaders how they feel about space and its availability on campus. 
The data was not ready at time of publication.
A source of qualitative information has been student round table discussions with club and organization leaders through the Department of Student Voice, according to Wirth. These discussions will serve as focus groups to help student government get a better understanding of what exactly the need is.
Greek life is one of the main organizations demonstrating a need for more space. They are one of the fastest growing student organizations on campus, currently containing 36 recognized chapters, according to Wirth.
One of the problems organizations run into comes from being kicked out of spaces, Wirth said. Organizations and clubs must request space through the University Event Scheduling, but the University can bump clubs and organizations at the last minute when the University decided there was an event that took priority over the student organization. 
University Event Scheduling could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.
The discussion about what is to go on the third floor has yet to happen, but Wirth speculated that it could include a lounge and more swing space for clubs to hold meetings and events.
SG would also like to move the Student Wellness Center from next to the Student Health Center, into a more centralized location such as MGC according to Wirth. The need for Sexualt Assault Prevention Coordinator Daniel Rappaport’s services have increased and the Wellness Center itself is in need of more space, including an office for the new Coordinator of Victim Advocacy Services according to Rappaport. 
In opposition to the student center, the University is also receiving pressure to keep academic offices there and to maintain that space for academic offices, according to Elmore. SG agrees the offices should be there until East Campus is completed but not indefinitely, Wirth said. 
Both Elmore and Wirth have said that students will be able to get the building if they are able to demonstrate the need. 
“The administration is most likely to dedicate this building to students if they hear student voices calling for it,” Wirth said.

Gaining access to international cinema can be a challenge. Films are frequently rare or out of print, and copyright issues occasionally prevent them from being seen at all outside of their host country. But beginning this semester, samples of world cinema are coming straight to campus and anyone can see them at no cost.
The International Cinema Series – a multi-year program sponsored by AU, the National Gallery of Art and several embassies – began in late September with a quartet of Italian films. Each film is carefully selected based on its cultural significance or simply because it is a never-before-seen gem. 
The Italian series featured an especially unique blend: two classic films and two contemporary films, each offering its own portrait of lifestyles throughout the country’s history.
International films are different from domestic films in several ways, according to Sharon Metcalf, senior director of Strategic Partnerships and Programs in the School of Communication. 
“The foreign films unfold at a different pace, but there’s nothing like film to give you the perspective of day-to-day life,” Metcalf said.
This will be especially evident in the next series of films, beginning Oct. 17. Four documentary features, all made in China, will receive screenings, and one of them (“Nostalgia – The Ballade of Village”) will receive its U.S. premiere. Each film presents a glimpse into the lives of Chinese citizens in both rural and urban locations.
November will feature films created in the Czech Republic, and in December viewers will travel to Greece.
Each screening is preceded by a brief discussion in which speakers offer introductory remarks. “Il Sorpasso”, one of the Italian films, featured opening statements from SOC Dean Emeritus and Film and Media Arts professor Larry Kirkman, as well as Michele Giacalone, public relations officer for the Italian Cultural Institute. 
“It’s very enriching for viewers to have that context and appreciate some of the nuances of the film that they might not have been otherwise aware of,” Metcalf said.
Audiences at the International Cinema Series so far have included Gallery members, film aficionados, AU students and staff, diplomats and many more. 
The International Cinema Series takes place in the Malsi Doyle and Michael Forman Theater in the McKinley Building. A full schedule is available online at american.edu/nga Cinema Series.

When D.C. mayoral candidates Muriel E. Bowser (D), David A. Catania (I) and Carol Schwartz (I) gather for a debate, arguments about their past run as deep as their differing visions for the city.
At their latest debate on Oct. 2 hosted by WAMU 88.5 at NPR, the three sparred over affordable housing, employment and education, among other topics. WAMU’s Kojo Nnmadi moderated the forum with a media panel of NBC4 reporter Tom Sherwood and WAMU 88.5 reporter Patrick Madden.
Catania criticized Bowser for not spending enough money to build and preserve affordable housing units as chairperson of the Committee on Economic Development. Bowser hit back by saying that she will spend $100 million a year as mayor in order to alleviate affordable housing troubles. She also touted the importance of creating new affordable housing communities. 
Schwartz, who said affordable housing is one of the reasons she is running for mayor, sympathized with residents who have been priced out of D.C. She said she wants to bring back “Ward 9,” referring to residents who have left for less expensive housing in areas such as Prince George’s County, Maryland.

The debate, although less feisty than the first debate of the season at AU, still had testy moments. And before issues such as homelessness and education could be discussed, the candidates needed time to talk out the past, including Catania’s history as a Republican.
“The Republican party that existed when I grew up doesn’t bear any resemblance to the party now,” he said. 
He added that he tried to engage the party on urban and housing issues to seemingly no avail. Catania, who is gay, said the party’s opposition to LGBT rights and same-sex marriage led him to quit the GOP a decade ago.
Schwartz is also a former Republican and former friend of Catania. In 2008, Schwartz lost her at-large council reelection campaign, which Bowser and Schwartz claim Catania had a hand in. Catania pushed back on claims that he helped engineer opposition to Schwartz, which upset Bowser.
“Even though I can’t look upon David with great fondness anymore because of the nasty personal attack that went on in 2008, I am not running having anything to do with you,” Schwartz said to Catania. “And I want to say that to your face.”
A day before the debate, a new poll commissioned by Economic Growth DC had Bowser’s lead at 8 percentage points over Catania. The results suggest a tighter race than previous polls, which seemed to embolden Catania on the night. An NBC4/Washington Post/Marist poll from September had Bowser with a 17 point cushion over Catania.
Catania, who said he has the most “progressive record” out of his counterparts, took the opportunity to again criticize Bowser’s legislative record as Ward 4 councilmember. 
“I’ve had enough of Catania and his ‘uninformed’ and ‘she doesn’t have the intellect’ and ‘she’s not smart,’” Bowser said when Catania criticized her education plan. 
On the issue of employment, Bowser said she wants to incentivize contractors to create jobs for the neediest D.C. residents, in addition to expanding the Summer Youth Employment Program to 24-year- olds. She pushed back on claims that job training programs always produce outcomes, saying that there are no checks on whether or not these programs have any “appreciable” change. 
When District voters go to elect their new mayor Nov. 4, they will also decide if they want to vote for the legalization of marijuana. Bowser and Catania both reiterated their support for Initiative 71, the name for the ballot measure. Schwartz said she opposes legalization. 
The next mayoral debate, sponsored by The Washington Post and NBC4, will be on Oct. 15.

The AU men’s soccer team defeated Bucknell University 1-0 in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania on Oct. 11 with a strong defensive effort, and they held the Bison to only six shots on net and three corner kicks. 
“Back to front, front to back, the team was outstanding today,” head coach Todd West said. “Our defensive four along with midfielder Mark Plaisance played a terrific match.”
AU (8-3-2) put seven shots on net, but the only one that mattered was junior midfielder Liam Robley’s penalty kick goal in the 33rd minute. 
“Liam was great all around today,” West said. “His addition to the lineup makes us more athletic in the center midfield and also lets Stephen Hauschild play up top where he has been huge.”
Junior goalkeeper Dylan Hobert registered six saves to escalate his season record to 8-3-2. He is currently tied for fourth in the Patriot League in total saves. 
With the win, the Eagles even their Patriot League record at 2-2-0.

The Eagles earned a quick victory on Oct. 7 when they traveled to Loyola Maryland and swept the Greyhounds in three sets.
AU (14-4, 5-0 PL) notched their 10th straight victory with the recent win, and the Eagles currently stand on top in the Patriot League standings.
“It was a solid night for us,” senior libero Megan Rosburg said.
AU scored the first point of the match off a kill by freshman middle blocker Erin Swartz. The Greyhounds (2-16, 0-5 PL) matched the Eagles first several points but were unable to keep up with AU’s offense.
The Eagles went on a 16-3 run and ended the first set 25-14, following another kill from Swartz.
AU continued their dominance in the second set, and they put up five points before Loyola managed to get on the board. The Eagles maintained control, and took the following point on a serving error by Loyola. 
Loyola’s errors cost them the second set, with missteps that ranged from improper ball handling to multiple attack slip ups. AU capitalized on the Greyhound’s mistakes and won the second set 26-14.
The third set was the closest of the three, but the Eagles maintained the lead. Senior setter Monika Smidova led off the scoring for AU with a kill, and she concluded the set in the same fashion, propelling the Eagles to a victory in the third set 25-17. 
Smidova earned 10 digs and 25 assists in the Eagles sweep, and junior outside hitter Allison also also performed well, leading the team with 10 kills.

The AU Eagles failed to keep their hot streak alive on Oct. 8, falling to the Naval Academy 2-0 in Annapolis, Maryland. 
The No. 20 ranked Eagles entered the game with a vengeance, and they fought to earn a win against the Midshipmen, who defeated them 1-0 last year, but the Navy offense proved too strong. The Midshipmen (6-4-2, 2-1-0 PL) separated themselves in the final 13 minutes of the evenly fought match, and they never looked back.
Senior defender Grant Valenstein secured the lead for Navy after gaining possession of the ball off a rebounded shot, and he launched a rifle past AU junior goalkeeper Dylan Hobert from the 22-yard line.
The Eagles (7-3-1, 1-2-0 PL) attempted to recover from the goal, but the Midshipmen defense held AU scoreless. Navy junior goalkeeper Jackson Morgan earned his second consecutive shutout of the season with five saves.  
Navy senior midfielder Geoff Fries notched an insurance goal with a minute to play to secure the win for the Midshipmen. He accepted a header from junior forward Jamie Dubyoski and outran the AU defensive line, earning a breakaway shot that soared into the net.
Dubyoski also served as a critical playmaker for the Midshipmen throughout the match, recording two shots on goal, and his physical offensive play characterized his performance.
With 26 minutes remaining in the first half, Duyoski was called for a shove, and he made his frustration clear to the referee, throwing up his hands in protest of the call. He earned a second foul only four minutes later when he continued to apply pressure to the AU offense. Navy racked up a total of 11 fouls throughout the course of the game, but neither team earned yellow cards.
The first half of the game remained tight as both AU and Navy struggled to create opportunities. AU junior midfielder Liam Robley worked to initiate offensive attacks in the early minutes, but defensive efforts from Navy senior defenders Jospeh Greenspan and Fries prevented the Eagles from taking control.
With just over 15 minutes to play in the half, AU sophomore forward Joe Iraola created a potential scoring chance for AU, as he took a pass from sophomore forward Jake Garcia and raced down the field, outrunning three Navy defenders. 
Greenspan ended Iraola’s play with a critical block, and he remained instrumental for Navy, stopping the follow-up shot from AU senior defender Conor Osborne as well. The Eagles continued to apply offensive pressure at the end of the first half, and Osborne attempted another shot with in the final five minutes off a corner kick from Robley, but Fries cleared the ball out of the zone.
Iraola continued to fight offensively for AU, and he led team with four shots during the game. With 34 minutes to play in the second half, Iraola sent a crisp shot towards the Navy goal, but he collided with a Navy player, drawing a foul. Sophomore forward Dale Ludwig, who also recorded four shots during the game, took the free kick but failed to find the back of the net.
Hobert recorded six saves during the game, but Navy’s late offensive surges overpowered the goalkeeper.
Head coach Todd West remains optimistic for his team’s future, despite the loss.
“I am confident that we will rebound,” he said, according to a press release.
