Junior Alexandra Taylor runs toward the ball in a match against Campbell Friday.
The Eagles’ strong defense kept the Campbell Camels’ score low, but a goal in the first half left AU with a 1-0 loss Friday at Reeves Field. 
This was the Eagles’ fourth consecutive loss, with the game finishing with the same score as last Sunday’s match against George Washington University. AU (1-6-0) made the same mistakes, such as failing to press opponents into vulnerable defensive positions, Coach Anabel Hering said after the game. 
“Today we played more responsively,” Hering said. “I think we struggled with being sloppy [when we had] the ball. We weren’t pressing at the top of the box, and that’s where goals are coming from. When we get stuck in those scenarios, we lose our organization defensively a little bit, and we aren’t able to clear the ball out well enough.”
Freshman goalkeeper Ryleigh Brown made two saves, the first being within six minutes of the game, but let one slide pass at 16 minutes to give the Camels a lead, which they kept for the remainder of the game. 
The Camels found themselves on the scoreboard when a fortuitous shot by junior forward Shannon Wratchford rolled past Brown, who slipped and was unable to contest the shot. Wratchford was assisted by freshman midfielder Hanna Maansson. 
“[Brown] has been doing great [things] for us, but there are still parts of her game that need improvement, communication being one of them.” Hering said. “There’s confusion sometimes when the ball gets back to her if our back line is going for it or if she is going for it. It’s an easy fix, it’s just communication.”
Another strong defensive player on the field was senior defender Kira Flaherty. Her ability to position herself near the goal while maintaining one-on-one coverage proved to be a huge success for the Eagles, preventing more goals from making their way to the box. 
“I know if the ball is coming back [toward our goal], we can handle it,” Brown said. “Kira Flaherty is my go-to. When I see that she’s one-on-one defending, I know it’ll be fine.”
The Eagles’ defense blocked the Camels from scoring at least a dozen more points. However, AU’s offense was no match for Campbell’s defense.
AU struggled with keeping possession throughout the game. The Eagles would be dribbling up the field, only to have the ball snatched from between their feet. 
Junior midfielder Yari Bradfield led the offensive attack, but struggled to get into dangerous positions to challenge Campbell’s defense. Though she kept the ball close and moved quickly, Campbell’s midfielders would consistently swept the ball away. 
Bradfield, forward Madie Light and midfielders Gabriela Maldonaldo and Audrey Denkler all recorded shots for AU, but none troubled the Campbell goalkeeper.
The Eagles will continue their season against Vermont at 11 a.m. Sunday at Reeves Field.

The American University men’s soccer team fell short against the Marist College Red Foxes, undone by two first-half goals before ultimately losing 3-0 at Reeves Field Thursday afternoon. 
Two saves by Marist's senior goalkeeper, Mark Rajovic, in the first nine minutes set the tone for the afternoon game. For 90 minutes, AU (1-4-0) just couldn't put the ball in the back of the net. 
“It feels good because we’re getting these chances [to score],” senior forward Vinny Barone said. “It shows we’re playing well. It stings because we want to get them in the back of the net.”
Though AU recorded more shots than Marist (16-11), they continually failed to find a way past Rajovic. Freshman forward Jerry Zouantcha and sophomore midfielder Matt Gillis both blazed shots over the crossbar midway through the first half, compounding the Eagles’ offensive struggles. 
The Eagles ended 2016 as regular season champions. They finished 11-5-5, falling short in the Patriot League championship to Colgate. However, they’ve begun the 2017 season losing four of their first five matches by two goals or more. Head coach Todd West said these tough games will prepare his team for the Patriot League.  
“These are the best pre-season games [before the Patriot League] we could ask for before we go to Boston [University] in two weeks,” West said after the game. “It’s a work in progress. Call me crazy, but you can hold me to my words, we’re going to be good when we go to Boston University.”
The Eagles nearly found the scoresheet with Gillis making a shot with only a half-hour remaining. He hit the crossbar, leaving the Eagles trailing 2-0. 
West thought “maybe if [the game] gets to 2-1, everyone will get a little energy,” he said after the match ended. “I keep telling [Gillis] to do the right thing and one of those [shots] is going to go in.”
While AU struggled to find the back of the net, Marist capitalized on their goal-scoring opportunities. Sophomore goalkeepers John Mino and Will McCreight split time for the Eagles, and West said he feels his goalkeepers could have done better on the goals that were scored. 
Allen Gavilanes scored Marist’s first goal 20 minutes into the first half with an assist from Juan Parada. Samad Bounthong scored the second goal, unassisted, less than two minutes later. Marist padded their lead with a goal by Brendan Gallivan with less than 20 minutes left in the match.
“You have to give Marist credit because they scored,” West said. “But if you look at it from our standpoint, [Marist’s first goal] was a soft goal. We gave up the first one and our keeper, who has made some saves for us, knows it was a soft goal. It’s a little deflating when you know you have to play a perfect game and then you gift a goal like that.”
The Eagles will continue their season against Binghamton at noon Monday at Reeves Field.
