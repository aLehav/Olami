•As someone who can't stand people who buy Apple products simply because they are fashionable, without knowing anything about their sometimes inferior functionality to Android or Windows 7, I'm glad to hear you got your IPhone or Macbook stolen. If you were stupid enough to pay an absurd premium for a fashionable hunk of junk, then were probably stupid enough to leave your Iphone or Macbook in a place where anyone could steal it.



•@"Every additional day that I'm here makes me wish that much more that I'd sent in my transfer applications. So exhausted from the harassment and lack of friendships." So do it. You need a change make it. Take the fall semester off and send in applications to be a spring transfer. If you don't look out for your own happiness no one will.
•"The "call me maybe" video, yeah, was that filmed on campus?" Are you stupid? No.
•Every time I reconnect to the Internet eaglesecure refuses to let me access any webpage other than the AU website. OIT needs to be fired and a whole new staff needs to be hired.
•@Editor Your argument about Sarah's privacy is ridiculous. She published a VERY PUBLIC letter in the Eagle. She's not entitled to privacy when she publishes a 2000 word essay about it. Honestly, you're unbelievable.
[Editor's note: Nope.]
•@Women's Initiative: An overnight prospie last week asked me if AU had a problem with an abnormal amount of sexual assaults because she saw the millions of flyers about sexual assault related programming. Her parents had been very concerned about it. Please take this into consideration when you're working on programming for next year. It's an important topic, but prospies shouldn't get the impression that AU has a rape problem.
•i wouldn't hate you so much if you weren't such a terrible person
•All this talk of Sarah McBride makes me think we're not talking about the true enemy of the people...Sarah Mclachlan.
•@ "You are being watched." You know, I always thought I was a really good candidate for a reality show.
•No, Editor. It does not work that way. Yes, I support Sarah, but you cannot make them a private figure by waving your wand. The moment she agreed to have her op-ed published, she made this a public matter. Publish all rants, not just the positive ones.
[Editor's note: Nope.]
•You know Sarah McBride should have focused on the rampant BLT discrimination going around here.
•@ "AU Vigilante, Will you be wearing a cape? Please wear a cape."
Because he's the hero American University deserves, but not the one it needs right now...cause it's summer.
•@ "If you had one month left to live, what would you do?"
Live under a bridge, change my name to "Captain Underpants," and throw dirty socks at on coming traffic. Next question.
•@ "What is the key to happiness?"
-To crush your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women.
•@ "Why am I so lonely?"
You and that chick who complains about the people making out in SIS should get together.
•@”And no, one guy at the University of Phoenix who studies psychics doesn’t mean anything.” Actually she does let scientists study her at the human energy lab at University of Arizona, not University of Phoenix. And the guy who runs the lab has a PhD from Harvard. Maybe she has special DNA, Maybe not. Maybe she is aware of a communication method we have not yet discovered. You are aware we used to not know about cell phone waves right?  Clearly you are very closed minded. And haven’t actually read any of her books.
•@ Sarah is being considered a private figure. No one deserves to have everyone comment on their gender and sexuality- I'm not saying we should hate and comment on it, but didn't she kinda give up that right to be a "private figure" by posting the article and asking for all the attention??
[Editor's note: Nope.]
•@Werewolf Syndrome guy
Holy $#!7. I hope I don't get rejected my scholarship this year. Because I really want to come back, and see THIS GUY. I'm sorry, but that seems really entertaining. Not in a cruel, mean way. But you'd seem like a real cool dude to be around. Don't get offended if I call you wolfy. Hell I get called names, but their not out of malace. We're with you Mr. Wolfy, 100% of the way.
•@Tinkerbell Syndrome girl
I don't think this girl knows that Werewolf syndrome is an actual thing...
•I just found out my best friend has HIV. He's had it since he was born. Goddamn, why would that kind of thing happen. Its unfair to him. He's a f*cking virgin for god sakes, never has done drugs. And he's HIV positive. He had a 25% chance of getting it from his mom. If there is a God, he's f**ked up.
•I think everyone should stop studying and make (then drink) SANGRIAAAAAAAAaaAAAaa !!! WhEEEEE
•I wish AU had more black people.
•Pretty sure there are hotter girls outside of sororities. I think it's because the good looking/confident ladies do not need scheduled events to meet people. :/ I'm just bein honest (Outkast quote)
•@”If you want to believe its real, you must first believe that souls and ghosts and goblins exist.” There is nothing about goblins in this debate, but nice try. Yes I do believe that we live on after death on the other side. And if Allison was faking it why does she refuse money for her services? She was a psychic for most of her life before she ever wrote any books. If she was just in it for the money, why would she go all those years forgoing any profit?
•@science can’t prove Allison DuBois: You are aware her husband is an engineer right? He writes parts of her books and he talk about the odds of her doing the type of mind reading she does on a daily basis of being billions to one. So is he just an unscientific engineer? And does Allison just have coincidences that are billion to one odds all the time each day? Or is it more probably that she has a communication method of hyperintuition that is outside the norm and that most of the population is unaware of.
•If dogs are able to tell when people will have seizures, why is it impossible that Allison DuBois is able to pick up on communication signals that most people cannot? Maybe there are brain wave signals that we just haven’t scientifically discovered yet.
•@don't let the ideas of Ron Paul die
You mean the rampant racism?? god forbid...
•@”Do you guys seriously not have anything better to do in the summer to read rants all day?” Not sure of your reading speed, but it doesn’t take me all day to read rants. Maybe 5 minutes. I have many summer plans but every day plans are enhances when I have new eagle rants to read. DAILY SUMMER RANTS PLEASE!
•IMO, the 3 keys to happiness are learning, traveling, and love.
•If I had one month left to live I would go on a cruise, take LSD, have a threesome, start a nonprofit for a cause I believe in, and write letters to all the people I deeply care about.
•SG can't do anything about the stolen property. Neither can Public Safety. The Vigilante is on it
•I LOVE SARAH MCBRIDE <3 <3 <3
•@What is yolo? : it means "you only live once". Not sure where it came from though.
•@yesterday's last rant: Actually the traditional way to quotation things (keeping in line with the idea to phrase the quote exactly as the person whom you are quoting phrased the quotation, one does not include the punctuation within the quotation if the person one is quoting did not include the punctuation in his/her quote. Adding punctuation inside your quote when no punctuation was part of the aforementioned quote to begin with is illogical, despite what the modern trend may have you believe. ;)
•I'm scared to let you go. But I'm also scared to let you in.
•Tell your roommate how much you care about her. My roommate and I lost touch after we stopped hanging out. Now she ignores me. I really wish I would have told her how much I loved having her as a roommate when I had the chance.
•Can we stop talking about Sarah McBride???
•So I told my girlfriend that she needed to grow up, and she slapped me right across the face, and then started to cry. We haven't talked... any advice???
•The editor is lame!
•(no longer) confused alum here: Thanks for providing the link, editor. That was quite a brave story. I'm glad to have gone to such a supportive and tolerant school like AU. Does Sarah plan on having reassignment surgery? Does she have a blog I can check out to continue to follow the story and also to to leave supportive comments?
[Editor's note: This editor isn't sure ...]
•Yay, Rolie Polie Olie! (He's the swellest kid around.)
•Is being transgender the result of gender identity disorder (GID) or can a person be transgender without having GID? jw
•@Wish I could just have a hook up... I'm the original ranter and seriously it would be so much easier to focus on all my papers, finals, and all the other stress in my life if I did have a hook up, but no guy I know seems to be interested...
•Sick of being compared to other people. I get it... your son is at Brown and has no debt... he's able to juggle amazing extracurricular activities with his academics while I can barely get into graduate school and already almost 50K in the hole. I've got a dad on dialysis who's dying and his dad makes a great salary... Life isn't fair and I'm not going to complain about it, but sometimes it just plain sucks... I will better myself though... just wait and see
•Oh, gingers, how I will miss you two!
•@My best friend and roommate might be transferring
One of my friends here who I feel closest to is possibly transferring to any Ivy League next semester but hasn't gotten the letter yet either. It really upsets me, even though I haven't let on for their sake.
•I found out today that you're dating your big...gross. I wonder how the fraternity feels about this?
•What are three keys to happiness?  Loving yourself, loving those around you, and a well executed clean and jerk.
•I'm actually genuinely sad that my sophomore year is ending. :( I know that I won't be able to see many of my close friends for a year due to study abroad.  I'll really miss certain people so much. Thanks for making these past 2 years the greatest so far.
•As fun as everyone claims college and frat parties are, I'm not ashamed to be excited to go home and hang out with my parents on Friday and Saturday nights-they truly love and care about and I missed them.. beats a frat any day
•I keep watching How I Met Your Mother because Marshall and Lilly are funny. But Ted makes me want to gouge my eyes out. He is s cliché and unfunny. And his jokes are so forced. And he seems overall fake and annoying. Does anyone else feel this way?
•AU really isn't vegan-friendly at all.  We were ranked at the top over 4 years ago– this year, the school didn't even place.  It doesn't make sense to have so few vegan options, since animal- free food is often cheaper and provides something that everyone can enjoy.  Omnivores need to stop hatin'.
