 Almost exactly two years ago, huddled in an Anderson Hall dormitory, a few students created what is now one of the largest campaigns AU has ever seen. Through time and turnover, our demand has been the same: AU Board of Trustees, divest our $550 million endowment from the rogue fossil fuel industry. Today, Fossil Free AU consists of over 30 on-campus organizations. It has won countless victories all leading to a vote on Nov. 21.   
Just 50 eager students attended our very first kick-off meeting in November 2012. In a few short months, we built a campaign from scratch and navigated university channels. We gained unanimous support from the faculty senate and the Student Government Undergraduate Senate. In a school-wide student referendum, 80 percent of the voting population supported divestment, the largest student referendum margin in the divestment movement to that date. We collected hundreds of petition signatures and photographs, disseminating our theory of change throughout campus.
  
After months of engagement with our Board of Trustees and students across campus, the November 2013 Board meeting approached and Fossil Free AU members were ready to engage. Over 60 students rallied on the quad before marching to the base of Butler pavilion, where the Board was meeting in the top-floor conference room. Using fishing line and bunches of balloons, students raised signs reading “AU DIVEST” up to their ivory tower. This interrupted the meeting as Trustees came to the window to see students demanding fossil fuel divestment. Fall 2013 escalated the campaign and brought students closer to the Trustees-- both inside and outside the Board Room.
In direct response to our campaign and efforts, the Board of Trustees created the Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investing and tasked them with creating a recommendation on the topic of fossil fuel divestment. The Committee is still effective and is comprised of students, faculty and administrators. Students all over campus and within the campaign eagerly awaited its review of AU’s investments and the tactic of fossil fuel divestment.
As Spring 2014 came around, Fossil Free AU students focused on building an incredible community. Countless spaghetti dinners, pancakes breakfasts and social events built a huge network of students ready to throw all of their social and political capital behind an eventual vote on divestment. Friends were made, theories shared and laughter exchanged. Hundreds of full bellies planned for a better future. That March, the four Student Government presidential candidates ran on a platform containing a divestment policy, knowing it was one of the most important discussions happening on campus. As relationships were built, so too was institutional support. The Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investing finalized and presented a report to the Finance and Investment Committee of the Board that called for a multi-step pathway to total divestment from fossil fuel companies. 
On Earth Day of 2014, the momentum of our community engagement culminated in a walkout of classes. Professors and students alike joined together on the quad to rally and march to the Open Forum held by President Neil Kerwin and Chairman Jeff Sine. Newly elected Student Government leaders and AU students from front line communities orated to an audience of over 100 people on that April afternoon. The urgency of climate chaos was palpable as we all marched into the forum holding the same bright orange signs, “Divest from fossil fuels.” The strength and dedication of the campaign was fierce as students pushed Kerwin and Sine to openly support divestment. Dialogue was heated as members of the Fossil Free AU community showed Kerwin and Sine that we were serious, that we were well educated and that we were there to stay. 
For the second year in a row, students remained after the academic year to create a presence outside the May Board meeting. The campaign escalated exponentially that May as students briefly occupied the space outside the doors of the meeting. With chants and speak-outs, we reminded the Board that the more they stalled divestment and delayed our chance to make positive change, the more we would escalate. 
This September a few Fossil Free AU organizers came together like never before: veterans of the campaign and brand-new organizers brought over 200 AU students to NYC for the People’s Climate March. The weekend set a new record for Climate Movement, and it set a new record for engagement at AU. Since the People’s Climate March, our general meetings have swollen in size, as well vastly deepened in leadership. Like never before, our team is prepared for a week of action leading up to the board  meeting. We know that national media and those suffering from climate injustice are also ready for the Board Meeting. They are ready to see our theory of change turn into a tipping point for the climate movement.
On Nov. 17, the incredible amount of power this campaign has harvested will be visible for all to see and join at 1 p.m. on the quad. Hundreds of people are already confirmed for attendance. As the campaign barrels forward to Nov. 21, all eyes are on AU. We stand ready to celebrate divestment or escalate our campaign to the next level. This is our stake in the climate movement and we are ready to tip the scales.

Despite the growing dialogue, the stigma attached to mental health issues persists. Despite the large number of people who struggle every day, the struggling is often done in secret. Even at AU, an institution know by many for its progressive practices, there is a gap.
   
Many students I know had to wait up to a month to have their first appointment with the Counseling Center. Mental health services are expensive, especially in D.C., and unaffordable for some. So, what can these students do?

Right now we are essentially telling them to keep quiet and deal with it on their own. While I do not doubt the Counseling Center is operating to the best of its abilities, the University is failing us. The lack of action and funding is another way of saying that mental health issues are just not important enough. 
In Spring 2014, a scandal involving students at an unofficial fraternity, Epsilon Iota, brought a lot of attention to this school. This sparked a campus wide change in policies and practices regarding sexual assault, for which I am very grateful. The issue AU chose to finally address has devastating effects on survivors and harms the community as a whole. While I am so happy the University has finally invested more here, it scares me about what it might take for the University to pay more attention to mental health.
Close to my hometown is the highly esteemed University of Pennsylvania. Within the past academic year, there were at least four suicides there. About 1100 college students commit suicide each year. Even more than this attempt suicide, and far more than that consider it. This is not something that just happens at other schools. It is something that many AU students have experienced, including myself.
As I said, AU labels itself as a very progressive institution, and in many ways it is. But the school continues to ignore the issue of mental health, leaving many to suffer in silence. AU gets away with doing this partially because of the stigma associated with speaking out. When the school was put in a very public position in the spring regarding Epsilon Iota, it figured out a way to deal with it and updated us every step of the way. Until we demand mental health services, AU will not change its policies. 
It shouldn’t take a suicide.

The AU men’s soccer team lost to Army 4-3 on Nov. 11 after a scoreless tie went into double overtime and ended in penalty kicks.
The Eagles (11-4-4, 5-2-2 PL) took the field hoping to further their successful season and continue their home game winning streak, but the Black Knights (6-7-6, 3-4-2 PL) shut them down. 
Sophomore forward Dale Ludwig, a second team All-Patriot League honoree, recorded five shots during the game, but the Black Knights stopped each of his offensive attacks. Army senior goalie, Winston Boldt, two-time Patriot League Goalkeeper of the Year, made five saves during the match and stood strong during the penalty kicks.
“We played a good game, and should have put our chances away earlier,” AU sophomore goalkeeper Lucas Belanger said. “I’m proud of my team and hope we can still advance to the NCAA tournament.”
The Eagles, ranked 31st nationally, have had unbelievable wins this season, including a 2-1-overtime victory over then-No. 1 UCLA. AU  now stands 11-5-3. 
The team will find out if they have a spot in the tournament during the NCAA selection show on Nov. 17. The U.S Military Academy will advance to the Patriot League Semifinals this weekend at Boston University.

NOHODAMON, FLICKR

Note: This post contains spoilers for season three, episode seven of “The Mindy Project, entitled “We Need to Talk About Annette.”
Only one show could tear me away from the 200th musical episode of “Supernatural,” and this week’s “Mindy Project” did not disappoint. Trouble in the Lahiri-Castellano relationship paradise! Mindy Lahiri (Mindy Kaling, “The Office”) witnesses boyfriend Danny Castellano’s (Chris Messina, “The Newsroom”) mom, Annette Castellano (Rhea Perlman, “Cheers”) shoplifting a leather bomber jacket. Mindy accuses Annette of stealing without referencing the bomber jacket incident and angers both Danny and Annette.
Meanwhile, Peter Prentice (Adam Pally, “Happy Endings”) continues to date romance novelist Abby Berman (Alison Tolman, “Fargo”). Abby reveals herself to be too much of a "cool girl" for Peter. She’s all for all night dance parties but she hates brunch! That’s a dealbreaker.
Over a guilt-laden dinner, Mindy reveals that she saw Annette steal the jacket, and Annette confesses to the action. Danny and Mindy make up, and Annette forgives Mindy. Mindy, Danny, and Annette attempt to return the jacket. However, the store clerk threatens them with a call to her supervisor, which in Annette’s mind, means potential jail time. The trio decides to flee the scene and keep the jacket.
This episode had a lot of great visuals, including Danny in the bomber jacket with aviators* (more on that later) as well as Peter in neon rave attire. Morgan Tookers (Ike Barinholtz, “The League”) had too few one liners, but I am loving the increased remarks from Annette’s seemingly omnipresent best friend, Dot (Jenny O’Hara, “Franklin and Bash”). 
Overall, this season is progressing well, which thanks to my general TV experience and current close viewing of “The Wire,” means that the series is due for some major conflict soon. 
*The highlight of this episode was Danny wearing his bomber jacket and aviators, dancing, quoting and reenacting “Top Gun.” He called Mindy “Goose.” The end scene alone is worth your time. 
Stray observations...
Tune in to “The Mindy Project” on Tuesdays at 9:30 p.m. on FOX.
