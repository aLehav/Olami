American University Student Government President Taylor Dumpson speaks at a town hall hosted by SG on Thursday, May 4 regarding Monday's racist hate crime. 
The American University Student Government held a standing room only town hall and press conference on Thursday afternoon to discuss action steps in response to the hate crime on Monday that targeted the historically African-American sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated.
Student Government President Taylor Dumpson led the two hour town hall. She plans to work with University administration on the steps discussed, which include public safety patrols at night, increased campus security and structural racism trainings for students. 
The AUSG Facebook page posted a summary of “Action Steps Identified to Move AU Community Forward.” The Eagle livestreamed the event on Facebook.  
“It is unfortunate that we were all brought here together by this event, but I believe this was a tipping point that officially caused everyone to say ‘enough is enough,’” Dumpson said. 
Dumpson then thanked the AU and D.C. community for their support. Many alumni of Dumpson’s sorority attended the event. They wore the sorority’s colors, pink and green.
She discussed why she chose AU for college, citing the school’s reputation as a politically active campus as the motivator for her decision to attend. She brought up a racial incident that occurred on Yik Yak, the defunct social media platform, in 2015. 
“Three years ago, I made one of the best decisions of my life in choosing American University, I found some of my best friends, my passion and my voice,” Dumpson said. “I never imagined that one day I would be placed in this position. I never imagined that I would become the AUSG President or the target of a hate crime.”
Student leaders demonstrate how the incident’s perpetrator could be prosecuted under the Student Conduct Code
Will Mascaro, the director for the Center for Advocacy and Student Equity, formerly known as the Student Advocacy Center, followed Dumpson’s speech. He explained recent changes to the Student Conduct Code regarding bias incidents, or events motivated by prejudice. The changes were made before Monday’s hate crime, which qualifies as a bias incident. 
He explained how the perpetrator of Monday’s hate crime, if that person is a AU student, will be prosecuted under the Student Conduct Code. If that person is not an AU student, the Student Conduct Code does not apply. 
Dumpson sees the recent revisions to the code as productive, but wants to see the University create stricter punishments for perpetrators of hate crimes, she said. 
Following Mascaro’s speech, SG opened the floor for student, faculty and staff discussion. Members of the AU community raised their hands to ask questions and make statements.
Lauren Lumpkin, a junior in School of Communication and editor-in-chief of The Blackprint, spoke about how she believes there needs to be more transparency within the process of the Student Conduct Code. 
“I think it just so hard to figure out where you start at,” Lumpkin said. “So, I think it needs to be easier and there needs to be a lot more transparency and what happens after a complaint is filed.” 
Alexis Arnold, a freshman and member of The Blackprint, spoke about the communication between the University and students about hate crimes. 
“Beyond AU Alerts, my issue with the last incident is that... the consequences weren’t clearly communicated to the student body, so I would like to see if there  are formal steps that the university will take in this process,” Arnold said. 
Natalie Hedden, a junior in the School of Public Affairs, spoke on the footage released from the University and asked for a reevaluation of the security cameras placement on campus.   
“I don’t know where the security and surveillance cameras are, but it’s absurd to me that filming two videos that are now out and the angles that they are I just find it interesting that they aren’t located on the major buildings on campus,” Hedden said. “So just reevaluating that would be a good idea.” 
University communications updates community on the investigation of Monday’s hate crime
The town hall was followed by a press conference led by Terry Flannery, vice president of University communications. 
“The investigation is continuous and the University is working with its law enforcement partners,” Flannery said. “As we described, the American University Police Department has the jurisdiction and authority in regards to investigating this with the assistance of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department and the FBI. We are not able to comment further on the status of this investigation.”
University President Neil Kerwin then gave remarks about the town hall. He acknowledged Dumpson’s “intelligence and courage” and her “tremendous ability to lead” in just her fourth day of office. 
“We’re determined to ensure that the rest of this campus and the entire community, in fact the nation and the world, understand that what occurred here has nothing to do with the fundamental values of this university,” Kerwin said. 
Kerwin has only three weeks left before President-designate Sylvia Burwell takes over the position on June 1.
After President Kerwin’s remarks, he entered a 30-minute “debriefing” session along with Dumpson, members of the SG executive cabinet and AU administrators. They discussed types of actions moving forward into the summer months and next year. 
President Kerwin and Dumpson did not accept any further questions, but Flannery made herself available to the press after the conclusion of the debriefing. SG Secretary Kris Schneider and SG Vice President Solomon Self provided a brief of the meeting’s discussion.
“I think that we’re going to get a lot out of this town hall. I think a lot of students came,” Schneider said. “They were able to voice their opinions in ways that we haven’t seen before at American University. Dr. Kerwin said that this was the most productive town hall that he’s been to… I would agree.”

Those professors among us who teach from the perspective of the oppressed are often tasked with un-teaching what our students learned before arriving. As we know, the education system is a crucial site of social (re)production, fully complicit in the art of domination. Children learn that our American hands are clean and our rule is just. To inculcate each new generation of patriots, Cowboys (or Cubs) fight Indians, “good” guys are pitted against bad hombres, super-predators, terrorists, the axis of evil. A children’s textbook in Texas refers to African slaves as migrant “workers.” Hegemony is secured in the rewriting of history. The original sin has been erased.
So this becomes a dilemma. It is difficult to talk of a shared heritage that celebrates victories of subjugation and extermination when one is not herself of the lineage of the conqueror, but to do otherwise contradicts the stories we as a collective – “we the people” – tell. This collective worldview endows on the conquered the Hegelian double consciousness of master and slave that W.E.B. Du Bois so eloquently extended to the black American. The master can only be shocked, angered or insulted when Beyoncé gets in formation or when Colin Kaepernick takes a knee. The master is not repulsed by the portrait of Andrew Jackson, who once offered $50 and “ten dollars extra, for every hundred lashes any person will give him, to the amount of three hundred” for his runaway slave, that hangs in the Oval Office.
The slave, by contrast, cannot but know the horror because she embodies our original sin.
The historical record is contested because its narrative pervades our lived present. It is ongoing. And while the “alternative facts” of the 45th Administration are so flagrant as to seem abnormal, our standard education is one of alt history, alt economics, alt politics, and certainly alt race relations. The “alt right” is brought to us courtesy of our alt education.
Power is a shape-shifter, and,with every gain of the subjugated, it manifests anew. So when Jim Crow at home and colonial rule abroad became untenable, racism came to be depicted not as a systemic or structural force but rather a problem of the racist individual. Being stripped of the institutions of racial domination, in other words, necessitated the erasure of their structural legacies. It pushed the problem of racism to that of racists, easily denounced in the collective purge of racist offenders. A generation is raised on this erasure, and claims colorblindness with the same surety as its sibling claims of neutrality, objectivity and universality. What’s wrong with All Lives Matter, the master asks? Doesn’t Black Lives Matter simply perpetuate these false divisions?
What’s all the fuss over a banana?
We have been here before.
The personal aberration, the defective racist, finds her corollary in personal responsibility. So after a half century it becomes legitimate to dismantle affirmative action, when studies show that it would take 228 years for black families to close the wealth gap with white families. When last year The Washington Post declared, “Net worth of white households in D.C. region is 81 times that of black households,” and described a “racial wealth gap” that, while frequently attributed to “individual character flaws” in fact represents “an extensive history of the structural barriers in local and national policies, Supreme Court rulings, programs and practices that created wealth for many White families and prevented wealth accumulation or stripped wealth from many Black families.”
The myth of personal responsibility is built on the erasure of America’s original sin. Thus it is with no small irony that I write as an AU professor in Washington DC, the belly of the beast.
The education system, a crucial site of social (re)production, cannot but be complicit in the art of domination. We are the intelligentsia, engaged in a war of position, which is all too often the intellectual production of revision and denial.
How then might we make agency of our double consciousness?
In reaction to Monday’s hate crime, occurring just as Taylor Dumpson became the first black woman president of AU’s Student Government, and against the national backdrop of the police murder of fifteen year-old Jordan Edwards and the failure of the Justice Department to prosecute in the fatal police shooting of Alton Sterling, the AU Faculty Senate proposed a Permanent AU Commission for Anti-Discrimination that aims to “develop the most advanced model in higher education for anti-discriminatory policies and accountability in the nation.” 
I applaud the measure. But we must go further, to the heart of our mission as an institution of higher education: let us decolonize. Let us challenge ourselves to be the most advanced model for teaching truth to power. When “diversity” and “inclusion” are superfluous add-ons, seminars and weekend workshops separated from the “real” work that “serious” scholars do, our students take the cue. In 2017, an AU student can still graduate without learning that this country and this world looks the way it does for reasons that make “we the people” look bad. Moreover, the classes that teach these truths are too often set apart as less stringent scholarship or posed as alternative readings of what is otherwise a normative reality. Is this what we want from the next generation of informed citizens in a multicultural world?
Responding to systemic incidents on this campus and elsewhere, the belated conversation around curricular change has begun: we are seeing the Habits of Mind AUx take effect, a Racial Literacy project went forward last year, a series of interdisciplinary degrees under the Critical Race, Gender, and Culture Studies Collaborative are unfolding, and faculty have submitted an AU2030 Social Equity Initiative proposal. May this be merely the beginning of something much greater. It is only when we un-teach the lies of the past that claims to a shared heritage will mean something other than the art of domination.

After online threats were made against Student Government President Taylor Dumpson on Thursday night, the University is providing students with “strategies for cybersecurity and personal protection” through a Facebook livestream on Friday afternoon, according to the University’s Facebook page.  
Teresa Flannery, the University’s vice president for communications, sent an email alert to the university community Friday morning about the threats made against Dumpson and the University’s efforts to provide resources to students. 
Friday’s Facebook livestream was held at noon and was moderated by Flannery and Doug Pierce, Assistant Director of Physical Security and Police Technology. The pair discussed tips and techniques for how students could enhance personal online security and safety. 
“We have seen just too many expressions of hate and bigotry,” Flannery said during the livestream. “They require all of us to respond. All of us need to speak up about our values.” She is hoping to develop new strategies for communications following the SG town hall organized by Dumpson on Thursday afternoon.
Pierce’s main recommendations for personal safety were to restrict public access to social media accounts, remove personal information from the Internet, deny friend requests from strangers, turn off location features on external apps and create another e-mail address specifically for social media accounts. 
Flannery and Pierce also answered questions from viewers and discussed how to take action if a student was harassed online, as well as the kinds of resources available from the University.
“We recommend that students who are feeling any sort of anxiety, not sure of what to do in terms of support go directly to the Dean of Students Office, or directly contact them at dos.american.edu,” Flannery said. She also noted that Mary Clarke, Senior Vice Provost, is communicating to faculty about self-care and how to support students during finals. 
Flannery also that the University’s new core curriculum will give students an “initial education” about issues of “race, identity and privilege” to give students a space in their first-year on campus to constructively build on their notions about identity. The program, called “AU Experience,” will continue to be piloted in the 2017-2018 academic year and will be fully implemented in the fall 2018 semester. 
Flannery said that the course, American Experience II, taken during the second semester for 1.5 credits will be the most critical course in AUx in fostering conversations of inclusion on campus as they will be mandatory for new students. 
“This is really helping students in a pretty small environment to think with their colleagues about their own identities, about the identity of others and how interactions are informed by those identities in ways that can be more constructive,” Flannery said during the livestream. 
The University Police also released a “Safety Advisory” at 11 a.m. on Friday about “Responding to and Preventing Cyber Harassment.” This is seemingly the first revisions in the AU Alerts system, which SG Secretary Kris Schneider said was the most “immediate” action that the University was taking to improve safety on campus in an interview on Thursday.
