• To the Star Wars fan ranter: you're trying to keep Star Wars "pure" but you're going to see Episode I in 3D? Buh?
• @YOU ARE TEARING ME APART EAGLE RANTS EDITOR!
WAIT HI. You have to be quoting "The Room", right?
• To the person responding to my gender neutral bathroom bashing, thanks for the input.
• Editor's Note: is it illegal to impersonate the Editor?
[Actual Editor’s Note: Yes. I will find you]
• @Gender neutral bathroom person.  Did you ever consider that maybe you're the one who is closed-minded for not considering that many people have conflicts with it due to their religion and beliefs.
• Fellow Lost addicts:
Someone start a club. or a meeting. or something!
Sincerely,
The Man in Black
• "...because you didnt work hard enough to get to a better school"
There's only so much you can do to compensate for a 440 math SAT score, even if you did get an 800 on the reading part and a 4.0 hs gpa. Not a matter of failing to work hard. I'm happy to be at AU because it actually is a great college, and the only time I felt disappointed was when I heard people whine about how they're not at Harvard. Disappointed in those students, not AU.
• @Editor's response to "YOU ARE TEARING ME APART EAGLE RANTS EDITOR!" I'm sorry you missed The Room reference and responded with N*SYNC lyrics instead. You also responded with the wrong quote to the LOTR's rant on 2/6/12. It's not your fault you aren't a nerd.
[Editor’s Note: Is this a Back to the Future reference?]
• I STILL THINK YOU'RE CUTE.
I'LL ALWAYS THINK YOU'RE CUTE.
THAT WEDDING BAND WON'T STOP ME.
• Wow, I can't believe the other LOST ranter posted the same quote as me *high five*
• I actually love getting eagle rants at night.  After a long day of school, work, and homework, it is somewhat therapeutic to read the rants.  Thanks for putting up with all this crap, Eagle Rants editor.
[Editor’s Note: High five!]
• If it’s not real, then what are you doing here, Jack? Why did you come back? Why do you find it so hard to believe?
• Why do you find it so easy?
• It’s never been easy!
• (((((((((((((what)))))))))))))
• oh hey eagle rants editor
whatup, we should hang out
-martin
• Thinking of transfering. Why can't AU's philosophy program offer any courses on metaphysics, the philosophy of mind, or the philosophy of language? Blargh...
• All this talk about the *huge* gay population on campus. I'm straight and single. Get at me. My number is ***-***-****
• Dear Boys in Room 446?
My roommate and I enjoyed your dancing in the window today. We would like to meet you one day. Have a great day!
• To Leonard Guy who feels he can't compete: the fact that you're so dedicated and concerned with your work is great! Have confidence, know you can do it, make plans and just try your hardest. I'm a senior so I know how you feel, but you'll be fine. it's not 6 classes, it's hard work and dedication that's key
• @There’s gotta be some way to find hookups without partying, right?: when you find it, LET ME KNOW ;)
• @ The person who said people who are happy here didn't work hard- Yeah, okay. Maybe YOU didn't work hard and are bitter about it, but some of us love AU. If you hate it here so much, work harder and transfer. Let the AU lovers be happy(:
• <3 So much love to the Rants editor for quoting N*Sync lyrics on Friday. <3
[Editor’s Note: If I wasn’t a celebrity, would you still be so nice to me?]
• It makes me a little sad to think there are so many people in the world who have not and will not ever experience bacon.
• Normally I'm an average to happy person but lately I feel either completely depressed or completely turned on. What's wrong with me?
• People who believe the Earth was created in literally 6 days over 6,000 years ago ARE crazy. Sorry.
• I'm drowning in responsibilities. Go away, to-do list. Go very very far away.
• Doesn't anybody like Age of Empires II anymore?  I know it is over 10 years old, but greatness doesn't go out of style.  Or am I just one lonely AOE girl stuck in the 90s?
• @“‘As the original poster, I am going to pretend you are the guy I wrote this about. I say we should both go for it." I am the guy you wrote this about. I want you to make the first move.
• @Guy with a drug problem because of his mom. I'm here for you. I totally and definitely get the condescending mom thing and how it can get to you. You. are. not. alone.
• "I wish my self esteem wasn’t too low to make friends." can I be your friend?
• @"Is it bad that even though I have a boyfriend, all I want to do is have sex with other guys? Im simply not satisfied and require the extra meat!" Grow up and get some morals. And some honesty. If you want to mess around then you break up with your boyfriend and live the single life. Otherwise, don't break his heart.
• Cute smoker boy, if only I could get close to you... cough!
• I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.
• I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot your wife is dead!
• Maybe it’s time you got out there and started meeting people. You know? Meeting women. Meeting women who didn’t give birth to you.
• @ranter criticizing paying for a degree that a person won’t use in the “professional world”: When did AU become a vocational school? Last time I checked, I chose to go to a liberal arts college to expand my knowledge on as many topics as I cared to learn about. Sure I will probably never use my poetry class in the “professional world”, but maybe we shouldn’t live our lives catering to what corporate America tells us to be.
• @"because you didn’t work hard enough to get to a better school: Actually many people at AU got into higher ranked schools, and chose to come to AU because it is an amazing school, an amazing location, and amazing, student body, amazing professors, amazing student clubs, amazing student activities each day, etc. But as always, haters gon hate. It speaks to their own depression rather than the actual quality of the school.
• @if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Does is not sadden you at all, the Americans define a person’s worthiness of education by their career path?
• @person who thinks going to grad school doesn’t help you be a better person/mother: Obviously you have never read a parenting book or taken a child psychology class.  Yes, there is much to learn about parenting techniques, and learning more about how children’s minds work (and how human minds in general work) will make one a better mother and a better person.
• @ if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Are you living in a box eating energy bars to survive? Because if not then you are taking unnecessary steps.  Life isn’t about doing only what is necessary. It’s about following the path that leads you to be the person you want to be. And the person I wasn’t to be an educated person with multiple graduate degrees.
• I just had the most amazing sex of my life. I didn’t even know sex could be done like that.
• @grad school for stay at home mom being selfish: I have already said that money is not an issue.  And actually, NOT going to grad school before becoming a stay at home mom would be selfish because if I ever were in a position to need money, having to enroll in grad school AFTER I have kids in order to get a job and support them take away time from mothering them. Please use your common sense a little more before criticizing.
• Stop changing your story all the time. It's really annoying.
• @“Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  Actually life just a ladder in the corporate rat race of social approval. Some people seek greater things in life like a philosophical understanding of how the world works and a good education (grad school included).
• @“Life is full of stepping stones that lead to your ultimate life goal, and if that life goal is to be a stay-at-home mom, it seems like you’re taking a lot of extra steps”  College and grad school are not purely steps to get to a job. If that were the case, then I doubt people would major in philosophy or literature.  Education is about learning to understand our purpose on this planet, learning to understand the beauty and majesty of the world and the social institutions around you, and become a more developed human being.
• Who actually cares about floorcest anymore?
• @Because you didn't work hard enough...bitter, much?
• Seriously?! You're in COLLEGE and you don't wash your hands after you go to the bathroom? That's horrifying.
• Eagle rants sucked on Feb 10th. Now I have to write an essay that's worth 15% of my grade. Yay
• Am I the only one apathetic to Valentine's Day?
• @person saying the stay at home mom shouldn't spend money on grad school because it is selfish: How dare you. And actually if this girl greatly desires a graduate education, then not going to grad school would be selfish to her kids because who wants to have a mom with low self-esteem who is brooding about how she wishes she would have gone to grad school, but instead she saved the money to use it on the kids.  I would not want to inflict that kind of guilt on a family member.
[Editor’s Note: ]
• I've never had a valentine.
• I'm not the only one who's been staying in this semester on weekends right...??

• No one explained the pledge process for me :(
• AU needs an undie run. who's with me?
• Ditto to the Anderson 6 North shower rant. I saw it too and I just wanted to die.  THE WATER TOUCHED IT AND THEN TOUCHED MY FEET. aksjks. so. gross.
• so, two people responded to my rant about how "if you like me, show it, if you don't show it, pick a side", and even though we go to a school of thousands, I hope to god one of those people are you. I don't think so though: I've seen your computer history, and there are no rants in it.
• You "want to keep Star Wars pure," and yet you're going to see The Phantom Menace in 3D?  Fail.  There are only 3 Star Wars movies, and Han shot first.
• To the random girls I walked back with from AEPi last night: Thank you! Never would have been able to find Tenley otherwise.
• I love the ability to have food be delivered to my door as much as I hate waiting for said food to arrive.

• "Guy in my Critical Whiteness class..." We have a CRITICAL WHITENESS class?!

• My Case Competition teammates have made me embarrassed to be at AU. I don't know how half the people in Kogod graduated from high school.

• I think people have formed a hate against me by joking and telling me I'm pretty and kind. If I were so pretty, and so nice, than why am I single? #AUFemaleProblems
• To any freshmen that feels like they don't fit in - Take it from a senior that had that same problem for four years... Just be yourself. NEVER EVER settle for anything less. Even if no one can relate to you, when your on the verge of graduating, everyone else will be worried about their future and identity while you stayed true, which is the best way to find the right career path... good luck and always keep your head up :)...
• Sometimes a lady just wants to get laid.
• I'm really worried, I just had to reassure your roommate that you be fine. I'm not sure I believed it myself.

Discovery Channel’s “Shark Week” is more than just a show about shark bites.
Shark Week Executive Producer Brooke Runnette spoke about the balance between maintaining the show’s 30-million-strong audience and promoting the conservation of sharks during her speech at AU Feb.7 in Weschler Theatre.
“That is really 30 million opportunities to create change and we can use this week to move the people, affect them so that they actually have some feelings,” Runnette said.
Professor Chris Palmer and Justine Schmidt, executive producer at media consulting firm Blue Tribe Media, invited Runnette as part of the Seventh Annual Spring 2012 Film Series hosted by Filmmakers for Conservation and AU’s Center for Environmental Filmmaking. 
As executive producer, Runnette’s job depends on her grabbing the audience and entertaining them.
“The big picture is: ‘How do we make these shows so the most people will watch them?’” Runnette said. 
However, she strives to do more than just entertain. Runnette said she tries to create a relationship between the audience and sharks to further conservation.
“What you want to do is get that other person who's watching your shows to feel like they want to do something,” Runnette said.
Runnette explained different techniques of creating this relationship, such as humor and storytelling, and showed clips from three episodes of “Shark Week” to the packed audience to highlight these techniques.
One clip featured comedian Craig Ferguson. 
Runnette used Ferguson’s appearance to bring in new audience members to the show through Ferguson’s humor. 
“One of the things I want to try to do is try to use that sense of fun to make the turn that I wanted to do in the week of people being scared of sharks to people being amazed by sharks," Runnette said.
One self-proclaimed conservationist audience member questioned the use of dramatic music with great white sharks, saying it did not help the public’s perception of the shark.
“The truth is the ocean is in danger. Sharks are in danger. How do we tell the story and get them [the audience]?” Runnette said in reply. 
Runnette cannot produce a perfectly conservational show, as it would not draw in the required audience, she said. However, she encouraged audience members to support shark protection and hopes to create a donation match toward shark conservation through Discovery Channel.
“We are going to put a spectrum of actions you can take because everyone does want to do something concrete, small that they can execute," Runnette said.
