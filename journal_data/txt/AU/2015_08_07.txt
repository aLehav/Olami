EDM duo The White Panda will kick off Student Union Board’s first concert of the academic year on Aug. 29 in the Tavern. 
Comprised of DJ Griffi and Procast, The White Panda has performed at Chicago music festival Lollapalooza and other large venues alongside MGMT, Mac Miller, Dispatch and Wale. In 2013 the Chicago-based group sold out at Best Buy Theater in Times Square.
The group is best known for its fifth album, “Barely Legal,” which premiered in 2013. In the album, the group mixes together pop songs from different eras. The song titled “Barely Legal” includes sound bites and riffs from Kanye West, Green Day, Justin Timberlake and Marvin Gaye.
“The thing that makes The White Panda so perfect for our show is that they're putting their own spin on the songs we already know and love so that no one has to learn their music to come see this show,” said Tam Sackman, the director of SUB.Second District Records member and AU student Terrell Green, a sophomore in Kogod School of Business, will open the annual Welcome Week show, according to a press release from SUB. 
SUB hasn’t hosted a live EDM show in three years, the press release said. Past SUB artists include Rap and Hip-Hop stars, such as Chance the Rapper, Run The Jewels and Lupe Fiasco. 
Doors will open at 9 p.m. for the concert, which is free for students with an AUID.
