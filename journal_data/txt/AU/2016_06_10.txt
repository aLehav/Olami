There I was, sitting through the interview with the guys who would eventually become my fraternity brothers. I was nervous. Questions kept popping up in my head. What if I don’t make a good impression? What if I don’t like them or even worse… they don’t like me? Am I trying to join an organization that isn’t as great as they have made it out to be thus far? But most of all I was worried about whether joining this fraternity would help me leave a good mark at my school. As it turns out, all of my worries were for naught.
Throughout my life if you would have told me I was going to be in a fraternity, I would have said you were crazy. Back before I came to college I had a very skewed view of fraternity life, one that I feel many people on our college campus have who are not a part of it. Our main purpose is not to throw the “best parties” or to only have the most attractive girls be associated with us as many people seem to think. It’s much deeper than that.
I know I speak for myself among many of my other brothers when I say that I joined a fraternity for better reasons than just to “have a good time.” Let’s be honest: it’s college. More likely than not, you’re going to have a good time no matter what you do. The reason I joined a fraternity was for the bond that fraternity brothers have that simply can’t be replicated without shared passions and values. I joined a fraternity because I saw all of the positive work that these organizations do on campus and wanted to be a part of it. Every fraternity has a philanthropy which they support and all are focused on  great causes. Whether it is curing cancer, fighting sexual assault, raising money for autism awareness, or any other kind of issue, you will find a fraternity who is passionate about it. In fact, over the past couple years, Greek Life has donated more money to Relay for Life than any other organizations. 
My decision to join Zeta Beta Tau (ZBT) is a decision I have never once regretted. The first thing that drew me to them was the strong sense of community I felt between the brothers and myself, especially that with the man who is now my “big brother.” During my interview with brothers on the social committee, I brought up the previous work I had done in high school to help my sister who had created a sexual assault awareness group in our high school. I also explained how sexual assault prevention was something that I held as very important. They told me about their involvement in one of the only philanthropic events based entirely on sexual assault awareness on campus with an organization named PEERS, AU’s anti-sexual assault peer education group. I immediately knew that this was the kind of fraternity I wanted to join.  ZBT was a fraternity that worked to be part of the solution to ending sexual assault on college campuses—not part of the problem. I wanted to be part of a fraternity where I would be proud to bring my sister, somewhere where I knew that I could leave her alone and trust that my brothers would make sure that nothing bad happened to her.
Furthermore, joining Greek life gave me the opportunity to get immediately involved. Within in the first semester of being part of the organization, I attended multiple leadership conventions, presidents meetings and Inter-Fraternity Council meetings. Because of my passion for sexual assault prevention, I was delegated to become a member of the Greek Wellness Coalition, a collective of Greek leaders in the AU community working to discuss issues in the Greek community. After just one semester of being part of the fraternity, I was given the opportunity to put my leadership skills to the test and now serve as one of the co-social chairs. It is mostly due to the support of my brothers and their willingness to help me become a great leader that I have grown so much not only as a student, but as a person. I feel that through them, my leadership capabilities have greatly increased and will continue to grow even more the longer I serve my fraternity.
On average, fraternities will host between about 5 and 8 parties a semester. That equates to only five or 8 nights. What about the other countless days that you are in that organization? Those times when you grab lunch with a bunch of your friends, bond over your likes and dislikes with people you would not have met otherwise, those are the days and nights that really matter. It is the  feeling you have when you realize that at a moment’s notice you can be surrounded by friends who want nothing more than for you to succeed and be happy. The incalculable leadership experience I gained by getting involved in the organization, the changes that I made with a group of guys supporting me in my endeavors; those are the reasons that I joined Greek life. To say that Greek life is nothing more than people looking to make stupid decisions and only have fun could not be further from the truth.

AU students are on the go year-round, and that only intensifies as the temperature gets warmer and the spring semester ends. From political conventions in California to volunteer trips in South America and beyond, summer takes students away from AU and into the world around them. This summer, the Eagle is launching a summer series chronicling their adventures. Join us as we publish a new story weekly on how students are spending their summer #AwayFromTheNest before they return to campus in the fall.
Rising senior Rain Freeman started her summer this year interning in the Risk Communication Department at the Food and Drug Administration, the department responsible for communicating health risks to the public. A summer at the FDA fits both her majors: Public Health and Justice and Law. Prior to interning at the FDA, Freeman interned at the Mental Health Association of Montgomery County, the Metropolitan Police Department for the District of Columbia and the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. Last week, Freeman took time out to discuss her new internship at the FDA via Facebook as part of our summer series, #AwayFromTheNest. 
Eagle: What exactly are you doing this summer at the FDA? 
RF: I am a Risk Communication Staff (RCS) intern, which means that I assist RCS staff members and clients in any way that is needed. For the time being, a bulk of my work consists of qualitative analysis that consists of me using qualitative coding methods to comb data for themes. Additionally, sometimes I sit in on meetings with potential RCS clients or help update materials for the Risk Communication Advisory Committee website.
Eagle: What made you interested in this internship? 
RF: I am very interested in public health program management, assessment and research and RCS does a lot of assessment and program research in order to find ways to help the FDA effectively communicate risk information. It’s something I really believe in and am passionate about. I am glad I was able to find the listing on the AU Career Web.
Eagle: What is the most exciting aspect of the job?
RF: I think I am most excited about the message testing aspect. This is where the staff tests messages for clients with certain risk information in order to see how it is perceived. For example, maybe I want to communicate to the public and consumers that my health product has side effects, but I am not sure the best way my message will be received. RCS will test messages similar to that in order to gather feedback.
Eagle: What are some of the most pressing issues facing the FDA?
RF: The FDA is composed of multiple centers having to do with either drug evaluation and research, tobacco control, medical devices, food safety and more. These centers all have their own most pressing issues. I would say, and this is very biased due to my background in health communications and my placement on the Risk Communication Staff, that the most pressing issue facing the FDA as a whole has to do with finding ways to provide information for the public to make their own healthy choice without unintended side effects that actually do the opposite.
The FDA realizes that putting a warning label on a certain product that may have dangerous side effects could also have the unintended consequence of people who need it not taking advantage of it, or the product being taken off the market by providers and therefore not being available to those who need it. Every action the FDA makes has consequence, whether the decision is “good” or “bad.” There are a lot of different, more specific problems individual FDA centers are having. However, I think they all face this obstacle in some form.
Eagle: What has been your biggest challenge so far (personally or professionally)?
RF: Commuting is hard. I can take FDA shuttles, Maryland RideOn, or D.C. Metrobus, but no matter which route I take, I have to wake up pretty early and commuting takes around an hour and 15 minutes. It’s worth it though. The campus is gorgeous!
Eagle: How do you think this internship will help you achieve future goals? Would you recommend it to other AU students?
RF: I think this will be very helpful experience as I narrow down the programs I am applying to for graduate school, as well as experience that will hopefully help spearhead future research I hope to conduct on my own. I would definitely recommend this to AU students interested in public health, health communications, health policy or health literacy issues.

With the rainy and cold weather gone, it’s about time to bring out the summer wardrobe! Whether they’re stored in the back of the closet, or you’re looking to expand the summer wardrobe, jumpsuits are a fun summer piece to wear when you’re sick of maxi dresses and shorts. Jumpsuits are either a hit or a miss,but don’t let that stop you from wearing them. They’re chic and bold; a statement outfit that can make you look confident and well put-together. Follow below to see examples of how to style and accessorize three different jumpsuits.
Find the Perfect Fit
Finding the perfect fit will help with looking polished and poised. The most important thing to remember when buying a jumpsuit is to never buy anything too tight or too loose. You have to find your Goldilocks fit in the middle. Anything too tight can make make you look like Catwoman, a look that no one should ever go for (unless it’s Halloween). Anything too loose can mask your figure.
A perfect jumpsuit will be tighter at the waist and looser towards the legs. Most jumpsuits come with a belt or are cinched around your waist to give it shape. Cinching your waist gives a feminine look by defining your curves.

Accessorize a plain, solid color jumpsuit with one of these fun accessories! This is a perfect outfit for a beach day, a casual summer lunch, or for a fun day of shopping.

Running a little late? Not a problem! The best thing about a jumpsuit is that it’s an entire outfit in itself. You can always style it from daywear to nightwear depending on your accessories.
