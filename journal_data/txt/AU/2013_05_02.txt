• "seriously editor, do you not see the hideous black diamonds with the question marks? Whatever you're using to check the word count of the rants is screwing up the formatting. Try something else!" This.  Except I don't think the editor CAN see the black diamonds.  His/her computer probably displays those characters normally.  
[Editor's Note: The black diamonds, much like the magical gnomes that live under my bed, are only visible to me sometimes.]
• Dear everyone, it's the end of the semester. So while you're busy with finals and all, also make time to go talk to your crushes and do fun DC things and hang out with your friends before summer. This has been a public service announcement.
• @There's a difference between stifling free press and protecting against libel.... You are still an idiot I see. Only a court of law can determine libel. What you and your doofus TKE brothers did was borderline criminal and a clear violation of the student code of conduct. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if some of you were expelled. But I digress. You have nothing to be proud of seeing as how your own charter was revoked. Have fun calling yourself "brother" when your own organization disowns you.
• TKE TILL I DIE!!!!!!!
• To all those TKE brothers, The Eagle just reprinted another several thousand copies of that "libelous" article. Are you gonna just let them get away with that "injustice?" Oh wait, TKE bros lack the testicular fortitude to even try stealing all the papers again.
• You are somewhat awkward (in an endearing way), but I just loved the way you sang JT tonight. Gay or Straight? With the DPA you never know
• Wisniewski's cookies are not that good. Someone had to say it.
• I like how members of the Student Media Board like bashing SG over transparency, when their budget transparency is by far worse than theirs. For shame.
• If after $50,000/year you are still stupid enough to defend everything you know is false via grammatically incorrect Eagle rants, you should have saved money and gone to state school where Greek life hides hazing better.
• @"so...is the TKE story real? or made up? i'm still confused."
Just because a bunch of guys trying to cover their asses say it's not true doesn't mean there's not evidence of it. You think there's been an investigation since January for nothing?
• @ S&M vs hazing poster (the one that made the well structured argument indicating familiarity with S&M, not the one that "tolerates" it.)
I put forth that there are differences between consenting adults where power dynamics begin and end with what is agreed upon in the bedroom, and institutions which already hold inherent authority over their charges and use hazing as a prerequisite for joining and receiving benefits of the organization (despite flaws, I understand frats are good on resumes and for networking, for example.)
• @"there is a difference between stifling free press and protecting against libel"
And what TKE attempted was the former. Protecting against libel would have been letting the papers be and making a counterargument, perhaps even legal action. Even assuming it was libel, the act of stealing the papers during the early hours and burning them only serve to reinforce the idea of an organization that sees thugish, mischevious behavior and methods as a way to function and is just poor public relations practice. 
• i don't want my hymen back, i just want my dignitiy
• @"That's because S&M is between two consenting, private individuals on their own time"
Yes, I understand that, which is why I wrote that I understand why AU wants to prevent hazing. What I'm asking is a broader moral question, not the narrow question of whether AU can/should ban or "monitor" hazing. The broader moral question being under what conditions should human beings be allowed to enter voluntarily into an agreement to be physically or psychologically harmed? AU can do whatever it wants--we can still debate a broader question.
• If something's going to happen between the two of us, it needs to happen now. Come on, grow a pair and make a move before it's too late.
• Seriously people stop hating on Zach Cohen. He's a nice guy who works hard at his job and is trying to keep the Eagle open to many different viewpoints. If he was interested in censorship he'd never allow these Eagle Rants hating on him to  get out either. Get a life haters.
• You think the hazing TKE did was bad? I heard the outgoing president of AU Dems made her successor listen to Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton read raw statistical data for two hours.
THIS.
• Wow, all my pro-life comments were deleted. I checked, and some were under 100 characters. Nice job on censorship, Eagle Rants editor.
[Editor's Note: When they're all posted together like that and it's abundantly clear that they came from one person and constitute one long argument, I treat them as one rant.]
• Things I find entertaining: when the two most annoying/obnoxious/pretentious/dorky groups on campus (the Eagle staff and SG) get into catfights on Facebook. It's like watching Larping.
• I appreciate that AU is serious about security, and part of that is password changes. I however fail to see the need to impose such harsh restrictions on password re-usability (can't use a password from last 8 used.) By comparison, the agency for my former gov job (without disclosing which, one where data security was *VERY* important)  required it to be different from the last five. Granted gov job had many other data security measures but my grades and even my stored financial information only need so much password restriction for efficacy. 
• Hazing is between consenting adults as well. They're free to drop the fraternity at any point in time. By not leaving the fraternity, they're giving their implied consent for whatever initiation practices occur. The only way the university would be able to construe it as "non consensual" would be if participating in hazing were a factor of a student's ability to remain at the university. 
• ay gurl tryin a get yo butthole liked?
• where you get tested for all da STDs?  I thought the student health center only does the HIV one for free...
[Editor's Note: The AHF Blair Underwood Healthcare Center in Dupont will also test for Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and Syphilis for free.]
• We all know TKE is not good enough to be underground. They will not last more than a year.
• If you think The Eagle has libeled you, file a libel lawsuit rather than steal all the papers and then brag about it TO THE EAGLE. I mean, damn.
• What are the rules on studying in SIS or Ward or wherever at night time? Are you allowed to? Can you go in the classrooms and what not?
• @"So... we can all agree that bikes are not allowe[d] on sidewalks in DC..."
D.C. Municipal Regulation 1201.9: "There shall be no prohibition against any person riding a bicycle or personal mobility device upon a sidewalk within the District, so long as the rider does not create a hazard; [except] within the Central Business District..." Just because you have a "District WONK" shirt does not mean you actually know anything about D.C.
• TKE likes to think they are the champions of truth and justice against "libel." Are you guys lacking sufficient brain cells? Oh well, it doesn't matter. Your organization doesn't even exist anymore, idiots. BAHAHAHAHAHA
• I voted for President Obama in 2012 and since 2008 have given more than 100 hours and $300 to his campaigns, but at this point I'd have to say that I don't approve of his performance.  Grow a pair, really.  Don't tell the world you've got redlines if you're going to let some tinpot walk all over them.
• @Mission Improvable celebrity crush - which one?
• @Editor's Note: I got tested last week! It's free! - do they do it for free on campus? Where did you go?
[Editor's Note: See above]
• @"Stupid azz editor try'n to make stuff up bout TKE. Dat ain't cool playa. Hell it racist. TKE TILL I DIE!!!!"
How did you get into school?
• Finals week makes me wish I could live off of iced coffee and sex.
• @" I sometimes look at the AU class of 2017 page and shake my head at all the childlike wonder that will disappear after the first month at AU"
Took me two days to realize how royally screwed I am coming here. 
• I absolutely hate the SIS Advising Office... My advisor left food stains all over my documents and she is so inefficient... Please remind me why I come to this school again?..
• Seriously TKE has nothing on the boys of MC5 antiquity. In the Cave you had characters like ScaryJ, Blago,PapaG, Slayer, and the Pup. Was no crew that could cause a ruckus like them.
• Rachel Karas should reveal her 5 anonymous sources or admit that its one person using 5 non-AU email addresses 
• Stop destroying Carias's character. He does not deserve that. The reporter should disclose the entire conversation between her and him both written and verbal. Then apologize for her poor journalistic ethics. What a disgrace! #firebadjournalists
• WHY?  WHY APRIL?  WHY NOT THIRTY ONE DAYS?
• Good call on Brennan, AU.  Now if only we could get a football team...
• I deserve an A solely on the most awesome pun I used for my essay title.
• My rando roommate hasnt paid a single damn internet this year, yet gets mad when I dont buy more toilet paper.
• I don't think violence is a good way to get people to recycle...just saying
• U suck EDITOR!
• 2 years here and still no action of Any kind. Maybe I should become a monk.
• Just go on campus and post the damn rants. Jesus.
• I think what you dumb turds need to realize is that the greek system is messed up! I understand that hazing is a thing, but it needs to stop. Why do you think the general public thinks that frat boys are douchey inconsiderate jerks?
• not sure people have fully comprehended that EVERYONE CAN HEAR YOU when you talk loudly on the phone or scream in the staircases of the library. Feel free to continue though, at least whatever you're saying may make a great "overheard at AU"
• My roommate just got Brown and Howard confused...
• Live diary of me watching Tiny Furniture: Oh my god. Oh My God shut up Lena Dunham. SHUT UP! NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR SELF-AGGRANDIZING BS. NO ONE CAAAAARES. Dat Puzzay, DAT PUZZZZzaaaAAAYayayayayayay. 
• @wants to bone during finals week: Yes!
• StudyTwerkStudyTwerkTwerk
• What the hell is my life?
• For the love of Zeus, will someone reign in these underclassmen? I understand that being loud and ignorant is a time honored college tradition, especially at AU. However, at least *try* to get the facts right (from all sides!) before you begin to organize a protest (and/or vandalize a vending machine).
• How is it possible that I'm sitting in the middle of the library but can't connect to the internet?  This is ridiculous, AU.
• No rants yet again... great job editor
• UGH PEOPLE. 
• alex bradley is the nicest guy in the student government. i wish u were still single
• Stanley Cup Playoffs > Finals 
• editor share free std testing info please
• editor you aint trying to post these rants on time or even on the right day
• Who won RHA prez? Anyone but lindsay for rha
• To the guy I was sitting next to and talking about our lit essays with for a profs office hours, you're a cutie!
• Yo editor, was it really necessary to know about your STD test?
[Editor's Note: For the 3 ranters who asked for more info, apparently it was!]
• Can we forget about TKE, and go back to dealing with the real thugs, EI?
• "TKE will never be EI. EI knows how to clean a lint trap."  Oohh, burn." burn down the house, you mean?
• first of all, the tke stuff was substantiated. just because those pictures got taken offline doesn't mean nobody saw them. and greeks as a whole definitely do not stand by tke. maybe some individuals and even organizations do, but not the entire greek community.
• Excuses are like asses - some look really good, but they all stink.  That's for you, editor.
