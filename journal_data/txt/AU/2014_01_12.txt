The new School of Communication building opened Jan. 6.
The McKinley Building will hold spring classes as the new home for the School of Communication beginning Jan. 13. 
However, final preparations are still being made to classrooms and public spaces according to a School of Communication press release. 
“All of the primary teaching spaces will be fully operational by the end of this week,” SOC Dean Jeffrey Rutenbeck said in an email.
The McKinley Building officially opened for faculty and staff, who moved in to the building on Jan. 6. 
Certain spaces in the building will still be under construction in the coming weeks, including the Media Innovation Lab, Michael Forman Theater, the rooftop terrace and the doctorate area.The spaces will be open in approximately six to eight weeks, according to an email from Rutenbeck. 
SOC’s new home was originally set to open on Jan. 2, but the opening was delayed because of setbacks in receiving the building’s Certificate of Occupancy. This certificate states the area follows D.C.’s zoning regulations and building codes, according to an email from Rutenbeck.
The new building will feature a rooftop terrace, a Media Innovation Lab with facilities for broadcast studios and editing programs, a theater that can seat 144 people, two computer labs and larger more spacious classrooms, as previously reported by The Eagle.
