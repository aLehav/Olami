Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be participating in the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the American University Washington College of Law on Friday, February 12, according to an memo WCL Dean Claudio Grossman wrote to the WCL community July 2.
The ceremony for WCL follows the delayed opening of the new Tenley campus, slated for completion before the Fall 2015 semester. The current schedule has the entirety of WCL moving from its current location on Massachusetts Avenue during winter break, with the new building opening for the Spring 2016 academic semester.
It is unclear who the event will be open to and whether it will be ticketed. It is also unclear whether Ginsburg will be invited as a guest of honor or if she will speak at the event. “We are deeply honored that Justice Ginsburg has made herself available to celebrate the opening of our new campus,” Grossman said in a press release. “As the first law school in the country founded by women, WCL could not be more enthusiastic about Justice Ginsburg joining us for this memorable occasion.”The ribbon cutting will take place on Friday, February 12 at 2 p.m., according to the press release.
