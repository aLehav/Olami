• Best brand of yoga pants that don't stretch out like crazy after wearing them a few times? So many girls at JFC have such perfectly fitted pants but I can't seem to find any for myself.
• @all the people you know are miserable and transferring: Hmm all the people I know love AU. Maybe get new friends. AU consistently ranks on Princeton Reviews Happiet colleges list. Sounds like a you problem.
• @belly button: I'm really curious, how do you use tour belly button to let someone know you like them?
• I have a flight layover in Denver on the way home. Now that pot is legal in Colorado, will they be selling it at the airport? I hope so. Never tried it and really want to...
• @boyfriend treats you like a wife: This happens to everyone. Honeymoon stage passionate love only lasts for the first year. It is followed by familial compassionate love (what you are describing). I recommend the books "Why We Love" by Helen Fischer and "The Truth About Love" by Patricia Love. 
• @bf checking out other girls: I check out other guys in front of my bf because I like watching him get jealous. It helps me affirm that he still loves me. Yes, I know I'm insecure. Lots of family issues growing up. I'm guessing your bf just wants to be reminded that you still love him because deep down he is insecure. Have you told him how much it hurts you? 
• True life the people who work at Capital one are the friendliest human beings on earth
• I wish okcupid would let you search by college rather than just by city. I'm too lazy to have a relationship with a GW boy, but I keep getting GW boys as my matches. Why are more AU guys not on okcupid? Or maybe they are, they are just searching for other guys and therefore aren't showing up on my matches. Ahh.
• @treated like a wife: How long have you been together? Thy is totally normal after 9 to 12 months. Even faster if you are living together.  The "high" of love at the beginning is nature's way of getting you to reproduce. It's a flood of dopamine to your brain. But it can't go on forever. You only have so much dopamine in your brain. And if you stayed in te once sauce stage of love, you would never get anything done in life
• Is Eagle rants ever going to create a spin off for all the "I still love you, come back" rants that seem to be infiltrating rants like a virus?
• How long is a normal time for a guy to be mad at his gf after a fight? (and during finals time)
[Editor’s Note: My mom always said to never go to sleep angry or you’ll have bad dreams, so I would say until the next time you sleep.]
• No one understands me but you. I don't know what I would do without you. Please don't leave.
• I've always identified as straight as I've always been sexually and emotionally attracted to guys, but in the past few years I've been really aroused by women...I'm still into guys and never have crushes on girls, since I've never been able to connect emotionally in a way that was more than friends. Am I bisexual? I'm not concerned or anything with labels. I'm just curious as to how people would identify me.
• There's a guy in my 8:55 anthro class who's super obnoxious and kind of nerdy...who I think is totally sexy. Your forearms do it in for me. I'll miss you, blonde guy with glasses.
• @ "I’ll start the bidding at 61 pages not including works cited.  I’m sure people can top that."
I wrote two books. Both 600 pages, due out in February called "No Fat Chicks Allowed in TDR" and "Wrinkly Balls: Now With Extra Alan Arkin."
• @"TO THE PEOPLE WHO RANT ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY MISS SOMEONE, HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT"
HOW CAN WE EVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF WHIRLWIND OF EMOTION THIS FINE GENTLERANTER IS TRYING TO EXPRESS WITHOUT THE PUNCTUATION?
• I'm so lonely, but I'm grateful. My friend group threw me under the bus and now I pretty much have no one here, but I'm still happy. I've always been afraid of losing everyone, and now I see the truth - loneliness isn't the worst thing that could happen to a person, and it's better than sticking with people who make you feel like the worst version of yourself. You start seeing the great things in life.
• @“Since when has ‘being white’ made somebody unable to speak up about diversity?" So you're saying that only Caucasians are privileged, but that's a wild assumption.  'Check your privilege' applies to us all; we are all attending a private university, so don't think that my skin color gives me any advantage over anybody else here.  In fact, it inhibits me- for example, I can't form a White Student Alliance to discuss diversity issues, or a 'Men's Initiative' and get school funding.  
• @ "Sorry, but the people who are putting on ‘shopping while black’ are really just being racists to white people" ... you realize that racism toward white people doesn't exist, right? Racism requires a power structure that other races in the US don't have access to. Prejudice toward white people exists, but omg if I never heat the phrase "racist toward white people" again it will be TOO SOON.
• I'm like 87% sure that my professor is actually setting me up to fail his final. We have a final paper and he is giving me different instructions than he gave other people in our class...
• Where can you go find all the old eagle rants?
• Either the girls staring at me think I'm handsome or my penis is hanging out of my pants and some stray cats latched on to it for warmth.
• God, I always thought people had at least a glimmer of personality until I met you. At first I was so interested since we share the same interests, but you're the most boring person I've ever met. I've gone out of my way to be quirky and weird and I know you think it's all hilarious. SO WHY DON'T YOU DO ANYTHING CLEVER. Sigh. I need an interesting guy.
• I feel like you smile bigger when you see me :) which makes my heart literally skip a beat. I can't wait to get back from break so I can see you again and make sure I'm right about this.
• Whooppps that I think I like you but what am i so afraid of rant was a joke... Meant to be sung to the tune of that David Cassidy song "I think I love you". Reread the rant, lol, and then carry on with your day 
• The Eagle editor is hot, I don't know if you guys have seen him in action but ohmygod what a cutie
• I foud where all the attractive guys at AU have been hiding, but if I told you all I'd have to kill you soo
• @“hoo-ha is actually the worst euphemism for vagina"--"vagina" is a euphemism itself.  It's just Latin for "sheath (of a sword)". And "penis" just means "little tail". And now you know; and knowing is half the battle.
• It's good to know that people will still get As by hooking up with their professors. Stay classy folks!
• Here's the thing, "I don't want to ruin the friendship" is a terrible reason to turn down someone who asked you out. My working up the courage to ask you out destroyed our friendship. At that instant, we're not friends anymore, and our relationship can take two possible paths: 1) you say yes and our relationship becomes deeper or 2) you say no and our relationship takes a major step backwards that can take just as long to repair as if we were dating and broke up. I already made my choice, now it's your turn. 
• Never in my wildest dreams, never in all my preconceived happy notions of it, did I ever think that college would be this lonely.
• @"Alright eaglerants lets see who has the best claim to complaining about their finals." I may not have you beat at word count, but I have to write 24 pages AND work two 9-hour overnight shifts doing heavy manual labor. Does that count?
• I'm seriously so sick of everyone complaining about finals. We all have to study and write papers and none of us are getting any sleep. Your negativity is only making everyone else pissed so stfu!
• I had sex (very LOUD sex) while my roommate was in the room and I'm not even going to pretend that I'm sorry because in a few days I'll never see her again and the sex was amazing. thanks, chief
• @person who responded to my remarks on why I don't go clubbing, thank you, very good to know there are other introverts at this school
• @IHOP idea. YES, YES YES YES, YYYYYYEEEEEEESSSS! Who wouldn't want access to pancakes 24/7?
• All Chinese people look alike.
• Sara Bareilles--Winter Song. So beautiful!
• @ So, I’m a gay girl, but have no idea where to meet other gay girls/lesbians -- you should definitely go to qwac events next year! there are a lot of gay ladies there to meet to be friends with (and then to later possibly date)
• good lord, y'all ranters need to get your sick-ass slut-shaming under control. when you try to instill puritanical bullshit on someone else, it ultimately reflects poorly on you. you are the one who comes off like an idiot for thinking that you know better about how to conduct someone else's sex/love life, and for thinking sexual behavior is one size fits all. 
• I notice a lot of rants about ROTC guys, have you guys thought of introducing yourselves? Most of them dont bite, unless you are into that.
• I think my bf is friend zoning me..
• It's not what you think, just one more little bet,
Just another cigarette, just one more drink.
• I'm digging my own grave
• jesus the only thing cool going on in eagle rants right now is that dude hooking up with his hot professor. everything else is terrible, racist, misogynistic,  awkwardly immature and ignant. 
• “Sorry, but the people who are putting on ‘shopping while black’ are really just being racists to white people." first, what event are you referencing? second, is this a f*cking joke? the idea of SWB draws ATTENTION TO EXISTING RACISM AGAINST BLACK AMERICANS IN THE US. so no, it's really not racist to point out societal inequities and racial profiling, it's progressive. also, the entire AU campus is the white student alliance so you good on that one. #BYE. 
• Rants Editor, please tell me how you deal with monitoring this much terribleness on a daily basis. 
[Editor’s Note: I have a very robust superiority complex.]
• My stress ball just exploded all over a library computer. Finals, doing great.
• @giddy over bf: made me melt!

The theme of the AU men’s basketball team so far this season was on full display during a 54-42 loss against Columbia Dec. 9 at Bender Arena. 
“If you could’ve sat in on a lot of our film sessions, a lot of our practices [and] a lot of our meetings, you would hear over and over just the theme of we have to finish,” AU head coach Jeff Jones said. “Have to finish a game, have to finish a possession, have to finish the half.”
Both teams developed an allergy to scoring in the first half. Columbia (5-4) started the game out 0-15 from the floor. The Eagles (4-6) could’ve used Columbia’s almost 10-minute scoring drought to mount a formidable lead, but they didn’t. 
“I could cite plenty of opportunities of where, in different situations, we’re doing good things and we just don’t finish,” Jones said. “… I think as much as anything, that’s a mentality of finishing a possession at either end of the floor.” 
The Eagles inability to take advantage of Columbia’s poor shooting came back to bite them. The Lions took a 20-16 lead before the half and never looked back. 
A big reason for Columbia’s success was its guard play. Grant Mullins and Brian Barbour scored 20 and 19 points, respectively, while playing 37 minutes apiece.
“When you look at the stat sheet and see that their guards combined for 39 points, 5 assists and zero turnovers … there’s a lot that goes into the game,” Jones said. “But that’s really where the difference [was] for us.”
AU’s Jesse Reed and Marko Vasic came in and slowed the Lion guards late in the second half, but it was too late. Their play was good enough to make Jones consider more minutes for the freshmen going forward. 
“I think it’s safe to say we’re gonna need to change some things around,” Jones said. “If those young guys can play that hard, we’re gonna have to live with some of the mistakes, but I think with [Reed] and [Vasic] in particular, we’re gonna have to find a way to get them in there so they can get experience.”
Double OT thriller
The Eagles were able to finish earlier in the week at Maryland-Baltimore County Dec. 6. Behind 38 combined points from guards Daniel Munoz and John Schoof, AU prevailed 73-70 in double overtime. 
Looking ahead 
The Eagles will have more than a week off between games, as they will next play at Hampton Dec. 18.

• To the girl on my floor who thinks it's okay to wear no shoes around the entire bathroom, YOU WILL GET FOOT FUNGUS
• AU freshman Girl in Panera: "I want a baby so bad that I have to keep stopping myself from doing it..." Awkward silence... 
• @Let her come to you: Thanks for the advice, but that sucks.  I wish she wouldn't have led me on because I do kind of like her.
• @Guy who made out with his professor: Wow, some of us (me) are so jealous! I'm a female and would be talking about a male professor, but still, way to go! I don't think there's anything wrong with you're doing. My question is just how do you do it!?
• i don't want to take finals or write these papers. i just want to cuddle with my boyfriend and watch netflix.
• I've seen my boyfriend just about daily for 7 months+ and still get giddy every time. I can't justify saying that I hate AU when I wouldn't have met him otherwise
• I'm just a Jewish girl who wants to be kissed under mistletoe.
• Someone Stoodel-ed about me. I feel so honored.
• TO THE PEOPLE WHO RANT ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY MISS SOMEONE, HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
• @"I remember the face but I can’t recall the name" - more details please? also, just ask her. it's more awkward if you keep running into her and don't remember where you know her from.
• I just met you
And this is crazy
But I want to lick white chocolate off you
So call me, maybe?
• AU's gender ratio is only marginally worse than the national average for private schools.  Think about that next time you blame AU's gender ratio for being single.  In fairness the large gay male population skews it a bit further, but you have all of DC available to you.  
• The other day in the basement of the library I saw a damn fine ROTC guy bend down to pick something up. I didn't even care if my group project members saw me stare. Mami likeee
• Why are so many beautiful girls in relationships with douchebags? And what is with so many AU girls doing sloppy rebounds? Stop. And wait for someone special.
• @I have no shame whoring myself out to you anymore: You really don't need to share your promiscuity with the AU ranter community. #LicenseToJudge
• This is my winter song. December never felt so long. 
• @" She was the hottest kisser I’ve ever had. . . Am I a terrible person?"
If you are having an affair with one of the hot female professors, I'm going to give up everything.
• @"What have I been missing all my life?"
AID's
• Call it one drink too many, Call it pride of a man 
• Okay.  So, I'm a gay girl, but have no idea where to meet other gay girls/lesbians.  I mean, to maybe be friends and date.  Anyone know where to start? 
• I'm really a cool guy once you get to have your face on my testicles.
• @• Why are we both so busy? Seeing you is more or less the highlight of my week, but it happens so infrequently. If only I didn’t find you so intriguing - then I wouldn’t feel so breathless around you and I could pretend that I wasn’t enthralled by your charm. This is one of the sweetest rants I have ever heard! I hope you get to see each other more often and keep in touch over break!
• @pull yourself together: hey. F*ck you. 
• @i hooked up with my professor...Note to self: start going to office hours
• Well that settles it with gender ratios and all the lonely people, gentleman it's obvious what we have to do....become male escorts
• @ "So I’m really into this guy, but I’m embarrassed because I have zero experience…guys of eagle rants, is this bad?" I think it depends on the guy. I'm a guy with zero experience so I would personally prefer someone who has no experience too. But that's just me.
• God Damn it I'm tired of being the lonely male nerd, I wanna be the nerd who gets laid!
• @ "When people ask me why I don’t go clubbing or to parties the reason is simple: I hate most people. People are annoying, rude, and can be genuinely unpleasant, include loud obnoxious music and that fact most of them are drunk and you have my reasoning for being an introvert." This is exactly how I feel! The majority of people are hurtful, annoying, and stupid.
• Sleepy Hahas: ACTIVATE
• @I hooked up with my professor: I expect detailed notes on how you made this happen.
• The nicest thing a resident can do for their RA is agree when the RA tries to enforce policy. If your RA asks people to quiet down in the lounge when you're studying, please be an amazing resident and ask the same. 
• My theory: It makes me feel better that I'm not the only one who feeling completely lonely here. Everyone honestly acts so happy and put together, but really, I think most of us are miserable and lonely. Everyone just puts on a happy face which continues the cycle because no one knows that anyone is hurting. Seriously I don't know if it's just AU or other colleges as well, but so many people I know are transferring because they are miserable here.
• @guy who was on letts 4n: i've had many a good night on letts 4 also...
• @"hoo-ha is actually the worst euphemism for vagina. "
I like hoo-ha. I also like gravy guzzler, grooler, jack and jillin', Louisiana shuffle, the great barrier reef, Jaws, cold cuts, Victoria's secret, pee-pee hole, New Jersey, the stink, the stank, the flaming lips, mudflap, Pokemon (because you can catch it all), Uncle Tom's Summer Cabin, Great Pit of Carkoon, and the black hole of Barsoom. "Vagina" is for anthropology feminists who take their babies to class and get mad when their entitlement is threatened. 
• @Since when has ‘being white’ made somebody unable to speak up about diversity?  Caucasians are just as diverse as Blacks and Hispanics; just because you’re Black or Hispanic doesn’t make you any more diverse then anybody else, let alone an accepting person and ‘diversity expert.’... stfu no one ever said white people were less diverse, and if they did tell them to stfu too. 
• Haha I'm feeling spiteful tonight. TAKE THAT!
• I'm beginning to hate myself but I can't stop making these choices.  People don't respect me because I don't respect myself and I don't know what to do about it. 
• @If a person cries and no one is around to hear it…that's sad.
I cried the other day right next to my gf when she was sleeping. It's not sad; it's better to cry alone, otherwise it's a cry for attention. Besides, if men cry, they cry alone, by themselves and never mention it to anyone. 
• @"Looks like someone is Zero Dark Butt Hurt-y" - I appreciate the pun, and as for Zero Dark Thirty -- it's sweeping the regional awards circuit and is the frontrunner for the Oscars, let's be real bro
• dude wtf don't add someone back on Facebook and delete them literally minutes later. rude.
• I wish Symantec Antivirus would stop telling me I have a virus. I don't. Leave me alone, you're only here because Eaglesecure made me install you.
• @"Since when has ‘being white’ made somebody unable to speak up about diversity?" plz tell me more we def need more white spokespeople to talk about diversity!!!!! but actually, that complaint is likely more of a request for you to check your privilege and recognize the spaces in which your perspective is relevant and necessary and space in which you should let others take the mic. 
• i haz mad luvz 4 da eagle rantz eDitorr
hey bb wats ur asl
• @Status: struggling senior willing to date a freshman for a tdr swipe - i can swipe you in w/o the date. you seem to be too desperate...and thats kinda asks
• @dtf? - don't take finals!
• i say we put an iHOP in the tunnel...think about it. and most of them are open 24 hours :o soooo basically food all the time. plus they would make a killing
• does a small dick really matter? that is the only thing that stops me from hooking up with girls here... that they will discover my small dick and tell everyone and I will die a virgin....
• I wish it was tequila thursday 
• One time I spit on my roommates pillow.
• All men should have beards.
• Freshman year. Since freshman year at Guapos.
• I witnessed an a-hole from high school severely cyber bullying a girl on facebook. I reported the incident to Facebook by clicking the designated button, but Facebook did not remove the posts (at least not yet). I want to warn the girl (she can't see it bc he blocked her from seeing the posts), but I don't want my name involved. What can I do? I tried creating a fake account to email her @facebook.com email but apparently that doesn't work. Suggestions?
• I am totally going to fail this final and I don't even care. I just want to get the heck out of that class. It's been torture all semester. GPA? Yeah, done with that. Goodbye smug students and even smugger prof. 
• I can attest that I am a certifiable bad *ss. Re-wrote my entire research paper in a little over 12 hours. And I still have time left to edit before submission at noon. Given, I probably wouldn't be here if I had actually worked on the paper over the last 2 weeks, but eh, let's save that discussion for another day. In the meantime, BAM.
• "Are there any straight, outgoing guys out there actually looking for a relationship rather than just a hookup?" (Appeared in Dec. 5 rants)--HI I'm one such guy. We do exist and hope to God girls like you exist!
• @I just want you to text me: if they aren't texting you, try reaching out to them!
• @I'm sick of only having feelings for people who can never know I have them"--- Don't think like that!! You have nothing whatsoever to lose by telling someone your feelings for them! The worst he or she will say is a surprised or polite "oh, thank you. . . . But I'm sorry I don't feel the same way." There's a high likelihood the person you like may like you back!
• @yeah, that was my main point. Premarital sex is ok, but BC isn't? Still just curious.-- Yeah I know it's pretty contradictory. Not sure what I can do about it. . . 
• @"When I said we couldn't be friends I didn't mean it. Can we be friends? I miss you" (December 6 rant) --- I've missed you a lot too. Try something you haven't done all semester and reach out to me. 
• @Ask me out already!!- little clue as to who this is, or who you like, would be really helpful!
• @"that actually would make me even more willing/(I'm not sure if this is for me though)" (Dec. 6 wanting to date before frequent sex)-- Sorry I only just saw this! You sound really interested :)
• @Ask me out already!!- little clue as to who this is, or who you like, would be really helpful!
• @Boys in sweaters are so sexy-- Thanks :) -Boy-in-sweater
• @I'm not a slut but my attitude toward sex is YOLO. . .--- spoken like a true slut. I've been right where you are now. Trust me. Stop screwing around, get tested, and work on truly getting to know yourself better. Then you'll start attracting men that not only will want you in bed, but who will cherish you for all you are.
• @"Damnit I miss you and I'd do anything to hear your voice right now. Except contact you." -- Contact him. It's worth it. You'll always regret it if you don't. He may still love you.
• Girls, remember the law of karma: If you treat a guy poorly who loves you, expect the same treatment from a later guy you love.
• @"I can't seem to forget about you"- you should really contact this person. They may love you, and they definitely still have feelings for you ;)
• @"I don't know what it is, but I'm stuck on you. . ."-- talk to the person! Seriously you should reach out! You have nothing to lose!
• @"Why are we both so busy? Seeing you is more or less the highlight of my week, but it happens so infrequently." -- you should reach out to him/ her directly and say this. I guarantee you they'll really appreciate it. They may even feel the same about you!
• @I think I like you but what am I so afraid of?"-- That's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. If you like him you like him. He also might be much larger than you'd expect. You'll never know if you don't try.
• @"So I'm really into this guy, but I'm embarrassed because I have zero experience."-- That isn't bad at all, he'll likely respect you more (if he's a good guy). Don't worry, I know a lot of girls and guys in the same situation as you. 
• @I miss your ginger hair and the way you like to dress: Hahaha I'm a ginger but I don't think this is for me. Either way, just reach out to this person. They might just miss you too. You won't know unless you try
• Seriously. Stop being such a whore. I've never met you but my friends know you. Everyone thinks you were such a better, kinder person last year.
• I never told him how sorry I was for how I treated him. Now he's gone and I'll never be able to tell him how much I treasured our time together.
• LET'S ALL HATE ON NEW JERSEY AHHHHH!!! -a happy New Yorker
• @"No, we need something in the tunnel that meets the following criteria:
Dirt cheap
Food that is terrible for you
Open late"
Yo quiero Taco Bell?
• sometimes, I still need you.
• @"to the girl next to me if she asked her friend if she was annoying..." Dude you might need a HIMYM intervention. Maybe I was annoying to you bc you were jealous of me. #sorrynotsorry
• I have an extra Of Montreal and Foxygen ticket for the 9:30 club show this Friday. Who wants it? $25
• @ The dumbass who kissed their professor: Probably should not have put that  in Eagle Rants. We will find you.
• Yo AU if you gonna set up a menorah...light it up ....it's not legitimate if you jus stick it there.....tf Kerwin, where'es your religious awareness homie?
• To the cute guy who always participates in my sociology class, I had a crush on you all semester!!!! Just hearing your voice two made class bearable. Then I saw you hanging out in front of MGC with frat guys.... I think I still like you though.
• Why is it that here at AU, no guys have asked me out all semester (tdr doesn't count...), but as soon as I step out to Georgetown, I get two offers???? Looking forward to going to Georgetown more often! 
• some of you guys are such nerds in ranking schools. 1 for ranking academic schools and 2 for ranking them using nerd things like Harry Potter and whatever the houses thing is referencing.
• Cant wait to go home to Chicago so I dont have to hear about Massachusetts or New Jersey or New York aka the most annoying places ever
• I keep thinking about that night together. I know you don't think I remember, but I remember. 
• Ian McKellen has cancer! NOOOOOOOOOOO
• I wish more people at AU would go to WEIRD electronic concerts with me. 
• So many people come and go in our lives. What I would do for a little permanence. 
• Yo, there some scandalous shiznit goin up in her wit peoplez hookin up wit profezors.
• a few wks ago I posted saying I was gonna build up the courage for your digits. Well I have them, and we haven't texted yet. Obvi you don't like me, even though all the subconscious signs are there- feet pointed my way, belly button, pupils. We have 2 classes together, so friday let's just get down and dirty. 
• Yea its the quiet girl which means I'm allowed to whisper! Stop giving me those angry looks! 3rdflr Mck side around 735 you left!!! 
• Procrastinating by thinking about you. ohhh this is bad in every possible way.
• The U.S. government is the only entity with more bureaucracy than AU  
• My boyfriend treats me like his wife. The problem isn't that he doesn't love me...he does. It's just I feel like he's not attracted to me anymore physically, and that it's a different kind of love, almost...bored comfort. Like how you love your mom or something. He said that's not the case but I still feel like this....anyone else in similar situations? WHAT should I do??
• My boyfriend and I have been dating for a while. He checks out other girls openly in front of me, claiming that its normal for guys to look at other girls when they are in committed relationships. This honestly is crushing my self-esteem and making me feel sex-appeal-less and ugly. Is this normal behavior on his part...?
• Seriously AU?? 'Shopping while Black?!' How about 'Attending your program while white?'
• My neighbor keeps whistling a song that includes a bit that sounds like Rue's tune for the Mockingjays in The Hunger Games... I keep whistling that part back every time he whistles it. 
• Urgh, I don't like hurting people. I'm just not interested in you. 
• Awkward Penguin over here 
• Grumpy Cat is so Grumpy 
• Sorry, but the people who are putting on 'shopping while black' are really just being racists to white people.  How would you like if we made an event like 'shopping while white?' after all, you guys would get all pissed off and cry 'racism' if we even created a White Student Alliance.  Stop perpetuating racism by putting on events like this. 
• Alright eaglerants lets see who has the best claim to complaining about their finals.  Who thinks they've had it worst in terms of writing essays for their finals?  I'll start the bidding at 61 pages not including works cited.  I'm sure people can top that.
• Starting to wonder if I'm ever going to find someone...
• So if you booty called me, does that mean I can booty call you too?
