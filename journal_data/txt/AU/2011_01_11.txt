To kick off the new spring semester, we have some interesting events on our calendar — Cee Lo Green will be performing in Bender Arena, MLK Service Day and, oh yeah, the Westboro Baptist Church is coming to protest our University. They say in a press release they’re coming to harangue us for being “fag-infested” and “pervert-run.” Shirley Phelps-Roper said they’re coming because they’ll be in the area for other protests and decided to hit us up while they’re around. Whatever motive you choose to believe, they’ll be here this Friday for a whopping 45 minutes on the corner of Massachusetts Avenue with an overwhelming contingency of seven of their members to do their thing. This description alone leaves us cowering in fear of … nothing.
We get it — they’re a very prejudiced group that’s said and done some reprehensible things. They’ve protested soldiers’ funerals. They’re coming to the area for diplomat Richard Holbrooke’s memorial and to protest the Islamic Center. They’ve called us “fag-infested” and “pervert-run.” Basically, they’re here to yell some stuff, stir up trouble and attract attention. And that’s the one thing we shouldn’t give them too much of.
Facebook groups and events regarding this protest have popped up over the last few days, encouraging students to come and protest the group. Don’t get us wrong, we love a good protest now and then — who at this school doesn’t? However, if we let the protest become too loud or violent in any way, we’ve let them win.
We shouldn’t want to give them that feeling of rich success – instead, by leaving them to stand on the corner of Massachusetts Avenue for 45 minutes protesting against a crowd of well-behaved students raising money for good causes, AU will win.
Their coming is noteworthy, but not an event.
Our response should be along the same lines. We should want them to know that we don’t agree with their beliefs by any means, but we’re not going to give them the attention they so desperately crave. If we erupt into anger and violence, then we’re degrading ourselves to their level. If we throw things, they’ll turn it against us. 
To the AU community, we implore you — don’t throw things. Don’t try to attack them. Don’t give them what they want. 
Let’s refuse to give them legitimacy to their hateful beliefs and show them that we are a community that rises above such prejudices. 
We’re proud of AU and we’re proud of the inclusive, accepting atmosphere here. Let’s not let a small band of protesters challenge our civility. 
Plans to turn the protest and counter-demonstration into a fundraiser is exactly the sort of way to turn this into a positive moment. If the Westboro Baptist Church wants to make a scene, we can’t stop them. We can, however, turn their own protest against them.

The men’s basketball team on Saturday defeated last year’s Patriot League champion, Lehigh University, by a score of 82-75. 
The first conference win of the year improved AU’s record to 11-5 on the season.
Senior forward Vlad Moldoveanu, the Patriot League’s top scorer, led the team with a career-high 39 points. The Eagles were able to shut down the Mountain Hawks but the league’s second-highest scorer, C.J. McCollum, was still able to post 32 points.
“If that’s any indication of how the league season is going to go,” Head Coach Jeff Jones said. “We’re all going to be in for a lot of excitement.” 
The Eagles trailed early in the game, struggling to hit perimeter shots and gain momentum against an aggressive Lehigh defense. Both teams racked up a large number of fouls early on, which hurt both teams’ momentum. 
Junior forward Stephen Lumpkins' back-to-back dunks gave AU momentum with 11 minutes to play in the first half and put the Eagles in the lead, 13-11. Neither team was able to pull significantly ahead of the other. Trading the lead six times and tying six others, Lehigh and AU were evenly matched throughout the beginning of the game. 
Lehigh took the lead going into halftime following buckets from Mackey McKnight and Anthony D’Orazio to give the Mountain Hawks a 30-27 lead. AU shot an abysmal 36 percent in the first half, and made just six of 11 free throw attempts.
The Eagles looked like a completely different team in the second half. Moldoveanu and McCollum appeared to match each other shot for shot. 
Down 47-44, AU went on a 21-11 run, highlighted by Moldoveanu, who scored 19 points in just a little over four minutes. The run produced AU’s largest lead of the night, beating Lehigh 65-55 with 8:34 to play.
“I had three guys around me in the playoffs [last year], so my mindset was I was going to get triple teamed [today],” Moldoveanu said. 
Lehigh closed the gap and pulled to within two points after a three-pointer from Holden Greiner. 
Moldoveanu ended the game 13 for 18 from the field and hit three of four three-point attempts. He also was a perfect 10 for 10 at the line and grabbed 12 rebounds. McCollum ended 10 for 22 from the field, hitting one three pointer and 11 of 13 free throw attempts.
“The guy I’ve got to tip my cap to is Nick Hendra,” Head Coach Jeff Jones said. “Guarding a guy like C.J. [McCollum] is a tough chore.” 
While it was Moldoveanu’s offensive contribution that put the Eagles in the lead for good, Hendra was a crucial part of the attack. He had five assists alongside eight points and 10 rebounds. Hendra spent the better part of the second half driving towards the basket instead of staying out on the perimeter. 
“When a team gets up and pressures [like Lehigh],” Hendra said, “I’m going to go down and go after them.”
Lumpkins had 16 points and nine rebounds on the day to contribute to AU’s 64 percent shooting percentage in the second half.
The win gave the Eagles a 1-0 record against Patriot League opponents and snapped a three-game losing streak to Lehigh. AU has had its best start since 1982, and four of its five wins have come to major opponents.  
AU will return to Bender Arena on Wednesday, Jan. 12, to take on Bucknell University (10-7) in its second Patriot League matchup of the year.
“The key to conference play is to win at home,” Jones said. “You don’t want to let one of these slip away.”

There’s something instantly commendable about being able to bring a song titled “Fuck You!” to such critical and mainstream success. 
For Georgia-born Thomas Callaway, better known as Cee Lo Green, this kind of endearing quirkiness has always been a crutch in a musical career that was long overdue for celebration. And on Jan. 14, the hip-hop provocateur is making a stop at the Bender Arena. Students get in for free with an AU ID and guests can come for $5. 
As an artist, Cee Lo is defined by his offbeat nature. He blends a number of different styles in his music and channels them through his unique voice, peppering the twang of Southern hip hop with nuances of soul and funk. His lyrics traffic through the usual fare of observations that come with everyday living. At times, they can be rather insightful and introspective, hitting a number of different layers of emotion at once while sounding delightful. 
However, that appeal seems to have been mostly overlooked during Cee-Lo’s solo career. His first two albums, “Cee Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections” and “Cee Lo Green… Is The Soul Machine,” faced a lukewarm reception amid favorable reviews and critical praise.
But a few years later in 2006, Cee Lo was almost impossible to ignore. He worked with Brian Burton, better known as DJ Danger Mouse, to form the funk duo Gnarls Barkley. His impassioned voice reached millions of listeners with the track “Crazy,” which got regular radio airplay and topped charts as a commercial success for their “St. Elsewhere” debut album. “St. Elsewhere” was praised for its stunning effort, receiving several notable nominations and winning a Grammy. His sophomore album with the duo, “Odd Couple,” was well recieved, though it didn’t produce another hit like “Crazy.”
Cee Lo remained mostly unseen by the public eye since his second album with Danger Mouse only to have his career explode in late 2010. With the release of “The Lady Killer” — the title of the album touting his lovable inner braggart — Cee Lo’s career would reach new heights as “Fuck You!” went viral last summer.
Jarringly bitter yet soulful, Cee Lo’s single propelled the album’s success. The track has become a universal anthem for anybody spurned by a former love. The sing-song and humorous quality of the chorus only makes the lyrics all the more ironically enjoyable. Cee Lo is bereft of any tact and proud of it, displaying his vocal prowess with an unmatched swagger and harmonizing through some incredibly catchy hooks.
The album itself is seductive and smooth, showing a more finely honed production craft compared to his previous work. The album is as good as the single would suggest.

AU students are mobilizing to counter-protest the upcoming Jan. 14 visit from a church known for protesting soldiers’ funerals. 
The Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kan., will protest the “fag-infested, pervert-run” school between 4 and 4:45 p.m on Friday.
Counter-demonstrations include a “Rally to Reaffirm Sanity” near the Kogod School of Business and blackout poetry signs across campus.
“If one of us is discriminated against, then all of us are discriminated against,” said Student Government President Nate Bronstein. 
The group also plans to protest at the Islamic Center on Massachusetts Avenue and diplomat Richard Holbrooke’s memorial service at the Kennedy Center earlier in the day.
“American University, like all the other universities in this country now, are teaching Rebellion Against God 101, 201 … you’ve got advanced degrees,” said Shirley Phelps-Roper, a member and attorney of WBC.
Phelps-Roper also said universities are not educating students properly.
“You children have been taught that God is a liar, that if you’re not fornicating your day away, you’re just a freak,” she said. “These people have taught you that it’s OK to be gay.”
The group was already planning to attend Holbrooke’s memorial, and decided to add the Islamic Center and AU to their trip. 
“We were looking for the next opportunity to picket American University,” she said, adding that the group wanted to wait until school was back in session. “It was a perfect triple-run.”
About seven members will be at the 45-minute protest.
There are no specific “fags” and “perverts” the group is referring to in its press release, Phelps-Roper said, but rather the student body and administration as a whole.
Security concerns
The group will be protesting near the northwest corner of Massachusetts Avenue, on the side of the President’s Office Building, near Glover Gate. 
AU officials said the group would not be allowed on the campus, which is private property.
Students will be allowed to counter-demonstrate on University property, and are asked to convene on the grassy hill behind the Kogod School of Business and the Kay Spiritual Life Center.
Public Safety has been working with the Metropolitan Police Department’s Special Operations Force to ensure a safe and non-confrontational event, according to Camille Lepre, a University spokeswoman.
AU response
AU’s United Methodist Chaplain Rev. Mark Schaefer said while he “hates” the activities of the Westboro Baptist Church on the AU United Methodist blog, he believes responding with love will "win out." 
“God, how I hate the way they portray my faith,” he wrote. “How I rage against their narrow-mindedness, Atheir intolerance, their limited vision. How they embarrass me and blaspheme the church.”
A Phelps-a-Thon page has been created to raise money for Queers and Allies. 
Phelps-a-Thon is a national website that turns the Westboro Baptist Church protests into opportunities to fundraise for targeted groups. 
People can donate a flat rate or pledge money for every minute the group protests AU. 
AU President Neil Kerwin said AU does not support the Westboro Baptist Church’s protest.
“We condemn the intolerant positions and uncivil actions of this group, even as we respect their freedom of expression,” Kerwin said in a Facebook statement. “The AU community strongly values diversity, inclusiveness, civility and tolerance. We will work with students and others to communicate those values in a powerful and civil manner that does not provide this small group of individuals with the confrontation they seek.” 
Student response
Students are already planning counter-demonstrations, both vocal and silent ones. 
Jonathan Lipton, a freshman in the School of Public Affairs, is organizing the “Rally to Reaffirm Sanity.”
“This is quite insulting that they’re coming here,” he said. “We are a university that does not support hatred.”
Lipton wants to keep this counter-demonstration peaceful and non-violent. 
“This is a rally to demonstrate our love and to demonstrate that we don’t embrace hate. It doesn’t make sense to protest hate with violence and hatred,” he said.
Student a capella group On a Sensual Note will perform at the counter-demonstration, according to Student Government President Nate Bronstein. 
Students are asked not approach or interact with Westboro Baptist Church members, Bronstein said.
“That’s just going to play right into what they want,” he said. “We’re not going to stoop to their level.”
Tara Culp-Ressler, a senior in the School of Communication and an Eagle columnist, made a Facebook group called “God Loves Poetry: transforming hatred into positivity.”
This is based off a national movement that takes the group’s press releases and makes them into blackout poetry.
“I think that American University has a really great center of activism and a lot of passionate people here, but sometimes I worry it’s focused in the wrong way,” Culp-Ressler said. 
Trying to be louder than the original protesters isn’t the best way to show them that AU is a campus of love, she said.
Lepre believes the counter-demonstrations will have a far-reaching effect.  
“This response has the potential to be a powerful community expression of AU’s values,” she said.

The Westboro Baptist Church is an independent Baptist church founded by Pastor Fred Phelps in 1955. The group is based out of Topeka, Kan., but travels nationwide to spread their messages condemning homosexuality, among others. 
The outspoken and widely criticized congregation has received negative responses to their frequent protests at funerals. 
Phelps stated in a video that representatives from his church would protest the funerals of all six of the victims of the shootings in Tucson, Ariz., on Jan. 8, including the funeral of 9-year-old victim Christina Taylor-Green. 
“The Westboro Baptist Church prays for more shooters, more violent veterans and more dead,” Phelps said in the video.
Although the group says that its protests are peaceful and protected by the First Amendment’s right to free speech, some critics question whether the group has a place at funerals. 
Albert Snyder sued Phelps and several Westboro Baptist Church congregation members for protesting at the funeral of his son, Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder, in 2006. Snyder originally won a $5 million jury verdict case against Phelps and group members for intentional infliction of emotional distress and violating the sanctity of the funeral. 
However a federal appeals court overturned the judgment, ruling that the First Amendment protected the activities of the group’s members. The Snyder family was then ordered to pay over $16,000 to the Westboro Baptist Church for court costs. Snyder refused to pay the damages, and the Supreme Court is now reviewing the case.
The group will be protesting at AU, but this is not the first time the church has protested a college campus. 
This past November, four members protested at Washington Circle near George Washington University. Over 200 GWU students and community members countered the protestors, according to The Hatchet. Many protesters wore T-shirts that said, “I’m Gay For Today.”
Church leader Rebecca Roper-Phelps selected GWU as a destination after a student unknowingly asked her during a campus visit to sign a petition calling for the legalization of gay marriage.

The women’s basketball team notched its ninth consecutive victory by defeating the two-time defending conference champion Lehigh University Mountain Hawks 64-51 Saturday at Stabler Arena in Bethlehem, Pa. 
“It’s nice because we know that we can go on the road and play well against a really good Lehigh team,” Head Coach Matt Corkery told AU Athletics.  “I thought several of our kids really stepped up in the second half and made plays when they had to. It’s a great start [to the Patriot League season] and a win that we can gain confidence from as we move forward in conference play.”
Senior forward Liz Leer led AU with a game-high 25 points to go along with seven rebounds, three blocks and two steals. Senior guard Nicole Ryan chipped in 11 points, as the Eagles became the first Patriot League squad to defeat Lehigh at Stabler Arena in the past 18 games. Lehigh’s Courtney Dentler had a team-high 11 points and registered six rebounds for the Mountain Hawks. 
 The Eagles executed an effective offense well all night while effectively stopping the Lehigh attack. AU shot 46 percent from the field and went 6-12 from beyond the arc, with Ryan and Leer each nailing three three-pointers. The Mountain Hawks misfired on 40 of their 56 field goal attempts. AU outrebounded Lehigh 43-33 to help limit second chance opportunities. 
“We struggled the whole game to get any type of flow,” Lehigh Head Coach Sue Troyan told Lehigh Sports. “Credit them defensively. We struggled to get any rhythm going on the offensive end.”
With just under 11 minutes remaining in the second half, Lehigh’s Emily Gratch made a layup to cap a 10-5 run that cut the AU lead to 45-44. 
The Eagles would respond by going on a critical 10-0 run that extended their lead to 55-44 with 5:41 left to play. Ryan scored five points during the crucial stretch.
Gratch hit a layup as the clock went under four minutes to pull Lehigh to within single digits. Dentler next scored from long range just seconds later to cut AU’s lead to six as the Mountain Hawks hoped to stage a comeback in the game’s final three minutes. 
But each time Lehigh made a run, the Eagles would respond with scores of their own. As AU held on to a 55-49 lead, the Eagles closed the game by scoring nine of the game’s final 11 points. Five points from Leer pushed the AU advantage to 60-49. AU outscored Lehigh 32-19 in the second half to come away with a 64-51 victory. 
With the win, the Eagles improved to 11-4 overall and 1-0 in conference play. AU will next play on the road against Bucknell University on Wednesday, Jan. 12, before returning home on Saturday, Jan. 15 to take on Colgate.

It’s a new year with the same old fear. We remain inundated with rainbow designations (Department of Homeland Security threat warnings), aggressive and invasive security, and predatory corporations ready to devour our tax dollars like starving wolves over their concocted financial schemes and plummeted investments. But thanks to the international emergence of Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks, fear appears to be a double-edged sword. 
It’s a treat to now see those most traditionally shrewd at instilling fear into the general populace — military, giant corporations, other governmental appendages — becoming fearful themselves. Perhaps it’s karma, their comeuppance. 
Are they truly scared? Based upon their hysterical reaction, prohibiting access to WikiLeaks and similar websites, the answer’s a resounding yes. A recent profile in Forbes Magazine quivers when anticipating the potential damage coming soon to a business near you: “The data dump will lay bare the finance firm’s secrets on the Web for every customer, every competitor, every regulator to examine and pass judgment on.”
Mark one down for the good guys.  
One example of U.S. government squeamishness is the (ironically) leaked e-mail - later formally denounced - sent to Columbia University from an alumnus warning students against posting public comments about WikiLeaks. The e-mail asserted voicing an opinion could potentially jeopardize one’s future chances of employment with the federal government. This intimidating scare tactic is revolting. It implies the government is hoping international service students are groomed to be robotic droids. 
Instead of apologizing for the tasteless unprofessionalism on behalf of her two-faced colleagues (diplomats slandering counterparts behind their backs), Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went on offense and immediately played the national security card. Something utterly outrageous becomes immediately permissible as long as it’s prefaced on behalf of national security. The trembling public nods its head in subordination.   
Those employed with the federal government are working for us. We pay their salaries and we deserve scrupulous access into their interactions. It’s further maddening that a Democratic administration, one that championed the “Open Government Directive,” has mirrored the fear-based Republican reaction toward WikiLeaks. According to the White House website, “Government should be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.” 
Talk is cheap, Mr. President. 
Some claim material is too sensitive to be plastered over the Internet. They believe the government is correct in censoring and vetting information. Besides the patronizing slight, we can’t entrust the government with this responsibility. If we give them an inch, they’ll take a mile. It’s like asking students to grade their own papers. Organizations like WikiLeaks constitute one of the only venues where the public can fight back. Integrity is something sorely missing in business and politics. Increased transparency will help fill this void. 
Additionally, censorship isn’t particularly democratic. Atrocities like Abu Ghraib will be remedied more quickly and potentially prevented if there’s expectation of full disclosure. If information is blockaded as too sensitive to go viral, then whatever the information entails shouldn’t be actuated anyway. Ultimately, a reduction of America’s violence should result when plans of bombing and murdering are detailed for all eyes to see. The vicious cycle of violence surely isn’t slowing under current concealment.   
Finally, the leaks aren’t an attack on anyone in particular. In the Forbes spread, Assange says, “In the struggle between open and honest companies and dishonest and closed companies, we’re creating a tremendous reputational tax on the unethical companies.” Companies, and also the government, have exploited ignorant consumers for years because they controlled the message. With a nod to the military, the technology they’ve developed will now be used to keep them honest. In the 21st century, privacy has become anachronistic. There are innumerable methods of recording; anyone expecting uninhibited privacy is naïve. 
Big Brother has proven inept and can’t be trusted. It’s about time we stick up for ourselves and start advocating transparency.

This year in film and critique was of a rare breed. It is not often that we can look back in retrospect and feel that critics and audiences alike are on the same page. Subsequently, it was quite a nice surprise that movies as artsy and bizarre as “Black Swan” were just as well received as epic triumphs such as “Inception.” It’s difficult to find someone who did not love “The King’s Speech,” “The Kids are all Right,” “True Grit” and “Please Give” all seeming to be favorites of critics, film festivals, movie snobs and regular Joes alike.? But there was one genre that perhaps did not get the credit it deserved form the public. Whether it be due to lack of advertising, low budgets or obscurity, this year lacked praise of documentaries. This is especially strange because 2010 played host to an inordinate amount of the most bizarre and heart-wrenching documentaries. 
“Restrepo”
The account of one platoon working to push back the Taliban in Afghanistan, was a frank, visceral and poignant work that took the viewer from their comfortable seat in a movie theater, stripping away politics, into the harsh reality of war. This film is a must see for any American, personalizing something many of us are so far removed from. 
“Catfish”
If the “Social Network” told the origin story of Facebook, then “Catfish” showed the unforeseen effects of the networking site. This documentary came about by accident and follows photographer Nev Schulman as he discovers the darker, Twilight Zone-esque side of cyber relationships. This film, shot by his friends, is unnerving, bizarre, and ultimately tragic, — however to reveal any plot points would ruin its effects. 
“Exit Through the Gift Shop”
This film follows a faux French filmmaker documenting the art of street graffiti as he experiences first hand the creative process and then goes on to create his own collection, all the while cheapening the art he obsessed over. This film was funny, off beat, and strange.? Whether or not it was made organically or as a critique to the “selling out” of street art, it is still thoroughly enjoyable and thought provoking.

Queers and Allies dropped its opposition to an Undergraduate Senate bill passed last semester concerning AU ROTC students, now that the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy has been repealed.
The Nov. 21, 2010 bill recommended the administration look into making changes to policies that currently deny AU ROTC cadets group access to AU fitness facilities for physical training and prohibit use of AUTO vans for ROTC transportation, among other things.
Last month congress voted to repeal DADT, a 17-year-old policy that banned openly gay and lesbian service members from serving in the military. President Barack Obama later signed the repeal bill into law.
Queers and Allies originally opposed the Student Government bill because it ignored DADT altogether, stating the issue was about student equality at AU, not sexual orientation. 
“You can’t ignore the fact the SG is requesting expanded resources for an organization that discriminates against a significant number of AU students,” said Queers and Allies President Tonei Glavinic in November. 
Brett Atanasio, the chairman of the SG committee, said while the repeal of DADT is key to eliminating any student opposition to the bill’s recommendations, administrative hurdles still remain. 
The bill calls for athletic facilities to be open to ROTC cadets for physical fitness training, that ROTC be allowed to use AUTO vans and that required Military Science classes for cadets be allowed to be held on campus if classroom space is available.
“With DADT gone, [administrative procedure] will be the main obstacle in the way of things like AUTO access and club status for ROTC,” Atanasio said in an e-mail.
The administration is already clearing the way for ROTC, and cadets will be allowed to use athletic facilities this semester, according to Phyllis Peres, the vice provost and interim dean for Academic Affairs, The Eagle previously reported.
Cadets will also be able to take military science classes at AU if space is available.
After communication between Atanasio and Queers and Allies to address concerns and the repeal of DADT, Glavinic said Queers and Allies now backs the SG bill. 
“Queers and Allies will look forward to working with SG leaders to make sure that this program is able to support students participating in it an appropriate way,” Glavinic said. 
Atanasio is also meeting with George Washington University Student Association President Jason Lifton to help the GWSA to make similar changes to its ROTC policy.

The passing of 2010 brings a slew of movies to look forward to in 2011. The Scene compiled a list of some of the most anticipated films of the year, including some wizards, pirates and an unnatural dose of superheroes. 
The Men in Green: 
“The Green Hornet” (Jan. 14)
The first of the green-clad superhero movies to be released this year, “The Green Hornet” stars Seth Rogen cast against type as a millionaire heir-turned-crime fighter. Chinese pop star Jay Chou takes on the role of his sidekick Kato, a role originally made famous on the 1960s television show by a young Bruce Lee. The modern spin on the story, with Kato being the brains behind Seth Rogen’s clumsy protagonist, makes “The Green Hornet” a movie to look out for in 2011.
“The Green Lantern” (June 17)
“The Green Lantern” on the other hand, looks to be a traditional superhero origin movie, with Ryan Reynolds playing the green (literally and figuratively) protector of the universe. Reynolds’ Hal Jordan is cocky and flighty, flirting with his boss played by Blake Lively, and doing daring stunts with his plane. Fans of the comic book hero might be somewhat irked by Reynolds’ lighter take on an originally more serious character, but no one can deny that Reynolds looks amazing in that bright green suit.
Book Adaptations
“Water for Elephants” (April 22)
The best-selling novel of the same name by Sara Gruen was an excellent piece of literature just waiting to be adapted to the silver screen. But when it was announced that the film would be starring Robert Pattinson as the main character Jacob Jankowski, things looked a bit bleaker.
However, the recently released trailer has swayed some doubtful minds, and the movie is looking more like a faithful adaptation of the book.
“Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2” (July 15)
It’s hard to fathom that it’s been 10 years since the first Harry Potter film was released, and even longer since the first book was released. But the global cultural phenomenon that is Harry Potter is finally coming to an end — and we’re going to miss it. 
The midnight showings, book signings and various Potter paraphernalia that has accumulated over the years (including an Internet musical) can’t even come close to explaining the impact that Harry Potter has made upon this generation. Thanks to David Yates’ fantastic direction with “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,” and the much-anticipated battle at Hogwarts, Part 2 looks to be the glorious and dynamic ending that the fans expect and the boy wizard deserves.
Superheroes! Again!
“Thor” (May 6)
It’s a difficult sell to begin with — a Norse god who loses favor with his fellow deities gets cast down to Earth and there becomes a protector of mankind. The Norse folklore in which “Thor” is steeped adds a nice twist to the tired superhero origin story, and with Marvel pulling out all the stops in casting and geek references to the Marvel universe, “Thor” looks to be an “Iron Man”-sized success.
“Pirates of the Caribbean 4: On Stranger Tides” (May 20)
You could probably list numerous reasons why Disney shouldn’t make another “Pirates” movie. You could argue that it wouldn’t be as good without Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley reprising their roles in the fourth film, or that the second and third movies weren’t that good to begin with. 
However, “On Stranger Tides” promises to deliver that Johnny Depp charm that won over audiences in the first place, as well as his potential chemistry with beauty Penelope Cruz. “On Stranger Tides” is sure to be explosive summer fun, and definitely something to put on your calendars for 2011.
The Only New Original Movies
“Super 8” (June 10)
“Super 8” is the mysterious, much-buzzed about movie by director J.J. Abrams, the creator of sci-fi and cult hits like “Lost,” “Fringe” and the director of the recent “Star Trek” film. Once again, he bestows his magic touch on the film “Super 8.” Not much is known about the film other than the title and the cast, which includes Elle Fanning, Amanda Michalka, and Kyle Chandler. Abrams is one of those few directors who can create buzz and excitement about a new project by just attaching his name to it. And he has succeeded.

Deandrew Hamlin is considered a “person of interest” in the murder investigation of the late AU Professor Sue Marcum.
Detectives are pursuing a number of leads, according to Lucille Baur, a Montgomery County Police spokesperson.
Metropolitan Police Department officers found Hamlin driving Marcum’s vehicle Oct. 25. He was extradited to Montgomery County Nov. 25.
He is charged with one count of unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, one count of theft over $1,000 and one count of unauthorized removal of property.
“We still haven’t charged him with anything other than auto theft,” she said.
His theft case has changed courts in the Montgomery County, Md., judicial system, according to the state’s attorney’s office.
Hamlin’s case moved from the Rockville District Court to the county’s Circuit Court Jan. 3, according to Seth Zucker, a spokesman for the office.
Zucker could not comment on why Hamlin’s case moved, but said there will be a hearing Jan. 14 to schedule future court dates.
“Procedurally, that’s what’s happened,” he said.
School of Public Affairs Professor Richard Bennett said this is typical of felony cases in Maryland, because the district court can only hear misdemeanors. 
“It’s not really moving up, it’s just continuing the process,” he said.

ATV’s weekly sports program, “SportsZone,” ends every episode with a “Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down” segment, so I decided to borrow this idea when recapping the 2010 sports year. Let’s start by getting the negative out of the way first.
Thumbs Down
2010 NFC West
Sam Bradford, Derek Anderson/Max Hall/John Skelton, Alex Smith/Troy Smith and Matt Hasselbeck/Charlie Whitehurst. No really, those were the eight quarterbacks that took snaps for NFC West teams this season, leading to a historically abysmal year for the division. The four teams combined for a record of 25-39, and finished with a point differential of -376. Good God.
Hall of Fame Voting
Two years ago, Andre Dawson received 67 percent of votes for the Baseball Hall of Fame, 8 percent behind the threshold needed for election. Last year, Dawson was elected to the Hall when he received just fewer than 78 percent of the votes. So you’re probably thinking he must have had a monster 2009 season to finally get elected. In reality, he hasn’t played since 1996, continuing the trend of enshrining players who fall into the “really good” category, instead of just the “dominant and great” group.
Washington Redskins
If you didn’t watch the Redskins one time this season, the following sentence could sufficiently sum up the 2010 campaign. Mike Shanahan started Rex Grossman over a healthy Donovan McNabb in Week 15, 16 and 17. Anytime the words “Rex Grossman” and “starting quarterback” are in the same sentence, good things don’t happen. With McNabb now disrespected, Washington is  once again in big trouble.
College Football
I’m finding it harder and harder to throw my support behind a sport that doesn’t have a playoff to decide a champion. Last year, were we certain that Alabama was the best team in the country? Probably, but we can’t tell for sure since Boise State also finished undefeated. The BCS has been around for 12 years, and that’s 12 years too long.
LeBron James
Does this really need an explanation?
Washington Nationals
At what point does the Nats front office personnel think to themselves, “Wait a minute, we signed a 31-year-old outfielder who has never hit .300 or surpassed 100 RBI to a seven-year, $126 million deal? What the hell were we thinking?” The over/under for this conversation taking place is four and a half years, and that might even be a bit too high.
NCAA Tournament Changes
This was one of those things that was perfect the way it was: 64 teams, divided into four regions of 16, with games being played Thursday-Sunday and the championship tipping the first Monday in April. So what happened? The format changed, of course! Now, we’ll be able to see the ninth-best team in the Big East, or the eighth-best team in the Big 12 rewarded for a mediocre season. 
Thumbs Up
New Orleans Saints
At first, the Saints had the hopes of a city riding on their season. As the 2010 NFL playoffs started, they became the feel-good story of the entire league. And during their Super Bowl run they accomplished two things: Knocking Brett Favre out of the playoffs (and making everyone outside Minnesota giddy), and forcing us to remember that regular season Peyton Manning is different from postseason Peyton Manning.
Duke-Butler
Butler was one half-court heave away from defeating Duke in the championship game of the 2010 NCAA Tournament. I never thought I’d write that sentence during my lifetime. And if that shot had dropped, it might have pushed this game from one of the greatest in tournament history into the greatest in tournament history.
Jayson Werth 
He just signed a seven-year deal worth $126 million dollars. Let that statement sink in for a little bit.
Armando Galarraga
Great sportsmanship was displayed by Galarraga, who was denied a perfect game when umpire Jim Joyce botched a call with two outs in the 8th inning. In fact, Joyce missing the call may have been beneficial to Galarraga in the long run. Five years from now, are you more likely to remember Dallas Braden’s perfect game or Galarraga’s near-perfect outing? 
‘Hard Knocks’
It was a brilliant job by HBO executives to select Rex Ryan and the New York Jets for the sixth installment of the series. There were so many great quotes from the season, but here are a that stuck out. He’s “just mad ‘cause he’s taking a pay cut,” Bart Scott on University of Southern California rookie Joe McKnight. “Some of these guys can’t play dead in a B-Western,” Ryan on the third-team defense. “Let’s go eat a goddamn snack,” Ryan ending a team meeting. 
Here’s to the 2011 sports year being more exciting and less Favre-filled than its 2010 counterpart!

As the NFL playoffs get underway, the Washington Redskins are once again spending January working on their short game. 2010 was supposed to be a step forward for the team, but in many ways, it was a step back.
When general manager Bruce Allen was brought in last season, many saw the hiring as a change in the way the organization would make personnel decisions. For years the Redskins had been criticized for constantly trading high draft picks for veterans under team president Vinny Cerrato, who resigned last season. However, shortly after Mike Shanahan was hired as head coach, it was clear that nothing had changed. The first major move the Redskins made was a trade with the Eagles for pro-bowl QB Donovan McNabb in exchange for either a third or fourth round pick in the 2011 draft depending on how McNabb performed in 2010. They then agreed to trade the pick that the Eagles did not get to the Saints for offensive tackle Jammal Brown, a pro-bowler in 2008 who missed all of 2009 with various injuries.
McNabb threw for over 3,300 yards this season, but also threw more interceptions than touchdown passes and was benched for the last three games of the season. It would be shocking to see McNabb in Washington next season. For Brown, 2010 was utterly terrible. He and others on the line compiled one of the worst units in the league. His contract is up and he will probably never wear a Redskins uniform again.
To recap, that’s a third and fourth round pick given away for one disappointing year from a quarterback in his early 30s and one terrible year from an offensive tackle who was acquired to protect said quarterback. Are we sure Vinny Cerrato resigned?
What the Redskins have needed to do for years is rebuild. Time and time again they have tried bringing in free agents and trading for proven veterans. Time and time again it has failed.
That being the case, the problem in 2010 did not start with the trade for McNabb. It started with the hiring of Mike Shanahan. When rebuilding you need a coach that can come in and take his lumps for a year or two or three. Shanahan is not that guy. He is not a young Jim Schwartz type. He’s a coach who is closing in on 60 years old and does not want to spend the next few years coaching a team that is rebuilding. Of course he went out and got a proven quarterback. He did not want to have to coach through the growing pains of a young signal caller. 
Whether he wants to or not, if Shanahan wants to be successful, he must accept a rebuilding period. This team is not ready to compete and will not be ready for years. The offensive line is in shambles. They don’t have a game changing receiver. They only have about half a strong season from running back Ryan Torain, who has struggled with injuries throughout his short career. And all of a sudden their defense, which has been one of the best in the NFL over the last few seasons, has become pedestrian. Needless to say, the Redskins have many holes to fill.
This season was supposed to be a changing of the guard in Washington.
There was supposed to be a change in attitude as to how to run a football team. It was supposed to be a season in which Dan Snyder and those who work for him stopped playing fantasy football with an actual NFL team. Yet, it was more of the same. Because of that, when football the Redskins will be worse off.

The federal government is in the process of creating a new internship program to give students more opportunities to try out federal careers.
The new Pathways Programs will organize internships for both undergraduate and graduate students, according to an executive order signed by President Barack Obama.
It will replace the current Federal Career Intern Program on March 1, which was often used by agencies to circumvent hiring military veterans, who must be given priority for government jobs.
The executive order says the current federal hiring process discriminates against applicants who do not have previous work experience.
Students in high school, college and graduate school are eligible for these paid internships, as well as students who have graduated within the last two years.
The order also states the new program will help agency employers evaluate students on the job, to see if they will do well in future federal careers.
Jennifer Carignan, a career adviser for the School of Public Affairs, said she isn’t sure yet how the changes will affect AU students.
“There’s not a whole lot of clarity about what’s going on right now,” she said. “For the most part, a lot of questions are still unanswered.”
She said many AU students have gone through the Federal Career Intern Program, which many agencies use for entry-level hiring. But the Career Center does not keep track of how many students have gone through this and other federal internship programs.
A December 2005 School of International Service graduate, who declined to be named for this story, was hired through the Federal Career Intern Program in April 2006.
He said he found his current job through the program, working to assist foreign militaries with counterterrorism aid. 
“It’s very difficult to get a job at the Department of Defense right out of college,” he said. “If you’re not a veteran of the military, it’s very difficult to get a federal job.”
As an undergrad, he worked for a private sector firm in the Pentagon. He said the people at the Pentagon liked his work and brought him into the Federal Career Intern Program after his graduation. 
He was hired directly into his current agency after the intern program ended.
He advises current students to look to consulting and contracting firms that work with the government while the new federal intern programs are still getting set up. 
“I thought it was pretty helpful for getting started within government,” he said of his private sector job.

Welcome back to American University,
Welcome back to your place of learning, your circle of friends and your home away from home. American University is a special place. We are a university that is committed to making the community, the city and the world a better place. This is not an interest but a commitment. A commitment that each one of us fulfills in our own way. We may fulfill it through the creation of beauty in the arts, innovation through the sciences or hope through politics. We have been and continue to be a University that is strengthened by these differences. This is everyone’s home regardless of race, religion, place of origin or sexual orientation. In recent days we have been reminded that there are still those who do not tolerate our tolerance. But such reminders are meaningless in the face of our resolve to spread our message of acceptance and inclusion. As we have spread this message our student body has become more united than it has ever been. 
Regardless of the term you use to describe us, we have defined ourselves by our actions. And this past semester proved to be one of the most incredible in terms of making meaningful change both on our campus and beyond. We enter this coming semester with a drastically expanded culture of service, new advocacy groups and one of our own in the D.C. local government. Our attendance at sports games is the highest on record and more students have involved themselves greek life, athletics and other activities than ever before. 
The Student Government has worked tirelessly to make life at AU the best it can be and this semester we have more initiatives, better services and more programming than ever before. However, this semester will only be as great as you allow it to be. The success experienced so far could not have been made by any individual in any organization or any single organization within the University as a whole. It requires that you involve yourself, discover your dream and pursue it with a fiery passion. American University is your launching board, your chance to give everything you can muster at anything that sparks your interest. So don’t hold back, take advantage of all the resources and opportunities that are available to you and enjoy the experience. And while you do, the Student Government will always be standing by to assist and support in any way we can. It has been an honor serving this student body, and I look forward to another incredible semester.
Nate A. Bronstein
President, Student Government

Ward Circle received the most comments in a recent D.C. Department of Transportation public survey of 176 intersections in Ward 3.
Chevy Chase Circle had the second-highest number of comments.
This correlates with the number of accidents occurring in Ward Circle, said Anna Chamberlin, a DDOT transportation planner.
The study is one part of a District-wide effort to find problem traffic areas in the city. 
The high number of comments may be attributed to “the underlying tension between a university and its neighbors,” that happens everywhere, Chamberlin said.
The final draft recommendations for Ward 3 intersections were presented in December, she said, and DDOT hopes to implement some of the short-term recommendations over the spring and summer. 
The long-term recommendations will have to wait for more funding, she said. 
The biggest concerns for Ward Circle were its awkward configuration and pedestrians crossing illegally at mid-block locations, according to the survey. 
“It is awkward having the two lanes go right through the middle while Massachusetts Avenue goes around,” Chamberlin said. 
She added that Massachusetts Avenue and Nebraska Avenue see high volumes of traffic, because people usually try to stay on these streets, rather than turn off on the circle’s other exits. 
Because with a circle, it’s meant to have people turn off on various streets, she said.
DDOT plans to bring in traffic circle experts, but funding is needed first. The agency’s traffic signal modeling experts do not deal with circle flow.
“They kind of seem to be their own creatures,” Chamberlin said of circles.
The experts will also need to look at upcoming developments to the area, including AU’s Campus Plan, a 10-year facilities plan that includes turning the Nebraska Parking Lot into an East Campus.
“That plan has to ensure there aren’t any negative impacts” to the traffic, Chamberlin said.
She said the area might not have high traffic simply because it is near a university, but that there are other factors to consider. 
In November and December, DDOT added new signs to the circle and made pavement improvements as part of previous recommendations, she said.
The final report is expected to come out in February.

F. Scott Fitzgerald famously once wrote “There are no second acts in American lives.” When Fitzgerald, then a forgotten man on the cusp of death, wrote that back in 1940 it was true. Yet ironically enough, Fitzgerald experienced a huge revival decades later and is now considered one of the great American writers. Therefore, his story serves to exemplify one of the most persuasive and ingrained traits of 21st century America. There are no longer any one-act plays in American lives. Today, every single fleeting celebrity has their 15 minutes of fame extended indefinitely. So we must ask, how did we get here and what does it mean?
Maybe it all started with Fitzgerald, or perhaps it began with Richard Nixon. This nation’s 37th president was infamous for his ability to survive scandals and setbacks from the Checkers speech, to the 1960 election, to even earning respect after Watergate. In fact, the political arena has become one of the main stages for this “never-ending story” phenomenon. For instance, one would have thought that federal indictments would have been the end for politicos Tom DeLay and Rod Blagojevich. But no, respective stints on “Dancing with the Stars” and “The Apprentice”, brought them back and are what most Americans will probably remember them for. Even Eliot Spitzer of call girl ring fame, is set to make a return to honorable discourse as a co-host for a primetime news show on CNN. 
Of course, the other major setting for this phenomenon is pop culture. Today, D-list celebrities have their pick of reality shows to join. In fact, now with original reality shows like “The Hills” and “Jersey Shore” celebrities are born so that they can gain popularity, and then create spin-offs, which creates new stars who then create their own spin-offs, and so on and so forth. Before you know it, there is a whole colony of people who are just famous for the sake of being famous. 
There seems to be two main causes responsible for this trend in our culture. The first is our media culture demands this phenomenon and therefore created it. Think about it, if there are going to be hundreds of cable channels, then they need shows, and they need people, any people, to star in those shows. Additionally, over the past few years, our news programs have shifted to gossip in order to attract more viewers. And of course, the Internet provides a limitless vacuum of information to fill. So altogether our 24/7, TV-meets-Internet, media requires us to have thousands of celebrities in order to meet the massive insatiable demands of our instant gratification culture. 
The second cause, though, may be seen as a more positive explanation. That is, that Americans love a happy ending. In the past, a major figure like Britney Spears for instance, would gradually lose her fame and end up a wreck. Today, though, she can have a “comeback” and be the “new Britney.” Put simply, Americans have become addicted to the sweet and optimistic classic three-act structure: rise, fall, and redemption. This has so become our obsession that we are merely repeating this cycle over and over again. Which begs the question, is repeated sanitized story-telling healthy for us? I can only imagine what Fitzgerald would think.

R&B musician Cee Lo Green, famous for Gnarls Barkley and “Fuck You,” will perform Jan. 14 at 8:30 p.m. in Bender Arena.
AU students can get one free ticket with their AUID and may purchase one guest ticket for $5 at the Student Activities office. 
The Student Union Board has about 1,000 tickets available, according to Karen Kong, deputy director of SUB. 
Kong said that SUB selected Green as a guest because of his growing popularity.
“His song ‘Forget You’ is pretty big hit right now, and we think that he’d be a great presence on campus,” she said. “People know him from Outkast and Gnarls Barkley, so it would just be a great way to welcome students back in to the semester with a big name.”
The two openers are DJ Amitai and Money, Fame and Love.
The concert is being held in Bender Arena in order to accommodate more attendees, Kong said. Previous SUB shows with B.o.B, Super Mash Bros. and State Radio have been held in the Tavern.
“We wanted to do a bigger show for the spring welcome back semester,” she said. “So we thought Bender would change things up a bit.” 
Bender’s doors will open at 8 p.m. 
There will be merchandise available for purchase at the show.

AU officials predict this year’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service on Jan. 17 will break several AU volunteerism records.
The goal is to beat last year’s record of 956 hours of community service, said Donald Curtis, the operations director of AU’s Center for Community Engagement and Service. 
Over 300 members of the AU community have already signed up to volunteer at D.C. organizations, at least 50 more than last year’s number. Curtis said he is 80 percent confident the goal of 1,000 hours will be reached. 
He expects 250 to 300 pledged volunteers to ultimately attend the event.
Service sites
• A Wider Circle
• Allen House 
• Barry Farm
• Delta Towers
• Emmaus Services for the Aging
• Sibley Plaza
• The Washington Home and Community Hospices 
• Campus Kitchen 
• Damien Ministries 
• The Family Health and Birth Center 
The number of volunteers more than tripled in the eight-year history of the event, Curtis said. By 2009, participation increased to 142 people from fewer than 50. In 2010, 239 people served throughout the District. 
Service sites
• A Wider Circle
• Allen House 
• Barry Farm
• Delta Towers
• Emmaus Services for the Aging
• Sibley Plaza
• The Washington Home and Community Hospices 
• Campus Kitchen 
• Damien Ministries 
• The Family Health and Birth Center 
This year’s volunteers will focus on challenging D.C. poverty.
“We wanted to attack different forms of poverty and address different groups of concern locally,” Curtis said
This year’s sites keep that theme in mind, and volunteers will help residents battling homelessness, hunger, HIV/AIDS and problems facing the elderly.  
New sites for 2011 include Campus Kitchen, Damien Ministries and the Family Health and Birth Center.
