Usually, when I begin to question college—its reason for existence, my role within it, etc.—I think about “Accepted” (the teen comedy film that came out a few years ago). If you haven’t happened to catch one of its repeated airings on various cable networks, it’s a movie that essentially mocks the entire higher education system. 
Frustrated with the college application process, a few high school seniors decide to forge acceptance from a fake university in order to please their parents. Eventually, their schemes unintentionally lead to the creation of an entirely student-run university, which is refurbished out of an abandoned mental institution. 
While their university becomes subject to a lawsuit by an accredited university, the Hollywood ending reassures us with a victory for the students, who eventually gain official recognition by the board of education. 
Although it may seem like a far-fetched pipe dream, the students in the film display a sense of unified, collective agency that is hard to imagine ever formulating on this campus. 
However, even though I criticize it, I am fully aware that achieving our potential for collective agency is probably the most challenging struggle we can ever face as students. It is a struggle that must be fought not only within the university’s parameters but outside, in the greater societal framework as well.
In May 1968, French students were at the forefront of uprisings that brought university and factory operations to a complete standstill. Groups of student revolutionaries, who espoused ideals of the Situationist International movement, agitated the French population into staging one of the largest general strikes ever recorded in history. Inspired by Marxist ideology, the students were fiercely critical of late-stage capitalism and the alienation it caused between human relationships. 
Two years prior to the strike, students at the University of Strasbourg stirred up a great deal of controversy when they published a pamphlet titled “On the Poverty of Student Life.” 
The students were expelled after printing and distributing about 10,000 copies of the pamphlet, which aggressively promoted Situationist philosophies and called upon students to reclaim their humanity from the mind-numbing depths of the prevailing capitalist system.    
Here is an excerpt from the pamphlet, translated from French, which outlines the students’ views on their predetermined roles:
“Modern capitalism and its spectacle allot everyone a specific role in a general passivity. The student is no exception to the rule. He has a provisional part to play, a rehearsal for his final role as an element in market society as conservative as the rest. Being a student is a form of initiation.”
This past Saturday, I attended a discussion group right here on the campus Quad. Organized as part of the new “Occupy the Classroom” learning collective series, a group of about 30 students met to discuss the topic at hand: our university education within the context of race, class and gender/sexuality.  
Before you jump into skeptical critiques that usually turn up when the “Occupy” label is placed on anything, you should realize that everything we discussed deeply affects all of us as lifelong patrons of institutionalized education.  
Ultimately, our discussions generated a few common themes. 
I noticed that a recurring theme was the existence of a hierarchical and highly individualized structure, which promotes education as a product to be consumed as efficiently as possible. Furthermore, I sensed a deeper frustration with this consumption narrative that seems to dominate all facets of our university education. 
Just as the Situationists declared in 1966, being a student today still seems to resemble taking part in a rehearsal for our future role as passive consumers in the market. They observed, “The student leads a double life, poised between his present status and his future role.”
So, it really comes down to a choice we must make as students. We can simply participate in the charade, reading off our well-memorized lines. Or, we can decide to use our collective agency to subvert the play itself and fulfill our truest desires as we struggle to reclaim our human dignity.

•I want to tell you that your ex boyfriend didn't cheat on you with "just some girl," it was me. But I also want to tell you that it wasn't consensual. But I am too scared to tell you, or anyone else. I am so sorry this happened, to both of us.

•To everyone who responded to my postings of T.S. Eliot; thank you as your kind words really touched me (no joke). I wrote these parts of the poem as a sort of goodbye, as I was ready to end my life but much of what some have said have made me take another look at myself and to keep going forward. Thank you.

•@ashamed to identify with AU feminists: I believe in equal rights for women. This means equal opportunity, not equal results.  The whole unequal pay argument is ridiculous. Women get paid the same amount as men for the same work. All women on average make less than men because women CHOOSE (repeat CHOOSE) lower paying jobs (like teaching and social work) more often than men because women often care more about helping people than making bank. When Women’s Initiative constantly brings up this non-issue about “unequal pay” it turns away logical women who know basic economics and have common sense.
•discussion over meaningful top@”Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...” STOP POSTING MINDLESS SENTENCES that are not actually well thought out arguments.  Our community builds upon logical and intellectual ics brought to lights by these rants. Ignoring them or seeking to cease their existence will do our school a major disservice.
•@”I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????” TDR won’t tell you this because they want you to spend much more money than you need to, but you can actually just forego buying a meal plan (after freshman year) and just use your credit card (or cash) to pay $6 each time you want to enter TDR.
•You can’t change biology. Women are the ones who have babies and therefore makes less money when they are staying home to nurse their babies and recover from giving birth. Trying to make women on average have the same pay as men on average is as stupid as trying to raise a fuss over how women on average have slower times in the 100 meter dash in the Olympics.

•@”Editor...please keep editing for content.” Ya censorship is a quality greatly admired in a journalist. While you’re at it, can you also please align all of our political views to the same side?

•I got on my computer today and soon after I decided that I would actually get some work done I thought, "You know what I haven't done today? Check Eagle Rants..."
•I wonder how many queefs happen during a Women's Initiative meeting...
•@more accessible birth control: YES! I second this until the end of time. I'm liberal but pro-life. I think there's a lot of problems to be fixed/steps that can be taken to prevent unwanted pregnancies before it even gets to the need for abortion. Divided, as the pro choice/life debate has us, we are far less likely to be heard or have our needs met than if everyone could unite for one cause.
•One day I'll like someone who likes me back, but apparently that day is not today.
•I'm a feminist who doesn't support abortion, and I would never take away anyone's right to do what they want with their body, but once you're pregnant it's not just your body.
•@correlation inst causation: agreed. I might even argue that it's more likely that these women are more likely to be sexually promiscuous because they're depressed (they want to feel needed, loved, etc). Not necessarily, but still. Which leaves the question: what's depressing women? Oh, I don't know, inequality and constant judgement, perhaps?
•@Secret underground lair: if there isn't already, we should find and claim one..
•to the ranter who started with "If you were my girlfriend" ILL BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND. I'm not actually desperate and I don't really want a relationship you seem like a genuinely nice guy, sometimes hard to find here
•To the lady who just called out a room of girls being too loud: rock on.
•@@where do Au students go to party? : "Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?"
you make me facepalm. relax a little. enjoy life
•I'm kinda pissed at the Eagle for not covering the event my club put on in the Tavern last week... Also, you should teach your journalists not to tell someone their event isn't newsworthy. That is very unprofessional and wouldn't fly in the real world.
[Editor's note: In the real world, someone would just not answer your email. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources to cover every event on campus. Thus, we have to prioritize.]
•Why are we friends when we are so fake to each other?
•I hate the fact that you are with your girlfriend although you say you hate hanging out with her. We have been hanging out for a while, either make a choice or stop flirting.
•I really hate you, but I'm still attracted to you. I just want to have crazy hate-sex with you all the time, everywhere. But I shouldn't, because you're a terrible person.
•@"Where are the lesbians on this campus?" the internet
•Lately, I've been going through some major life changes that include my 20th birthday, becoming a legal guardian of my younger brother who has autism, and having a severe allergic reaction that resulted in a brush with death. I don't know how to tell my girlfriend that these are the things that are bothering me because I'm afraid she won't understand or care. What should I do?
•Dear SIS, I'm "glad" that you're enjoying the use of the Katzen atrium. I don't mind the fact that I'm trying to get to class while you're all stuffing your faces, because I know how much you wish you had an atrium of your own. Oh, hold on a minute...
•Anyone else loling at how many times the guy who wrote the anti-Take Back the Night status is shown smiling and shaking maracas in the Eagle's video coverage of the event?
•Has anyone else ever heard of eating cinnamon rolls and chili together?
[Editor's note: Whaaa?]
•I'm sooo excited to see the Wonk City music video.... but actually
•There is no support group for my issues. :(
•We were lying down making out. Things escalated and then he stuck it inside me. I didn't want him to, but it was too late to say no since it was already inside me and I was no longer a virgin. Since I never actually said no, this isn't legally rape. But I never said yes either. AU needs to do more to educate young people on the process of consent.
[Editor's note: Just because you didn't verbalize "no," that doesn't mean it was consensual sex. And just because things started out consensual, that doesn't mean everything is consensual. Consent can be taken away at any time. A medical foundation in Palo Alto has some good information about consent here. 
•I love you so much you have no idea. But I feel like I have to act like I'm not that interested so that you will keep chasing me and keep loving me. I really wish this game would end already and we could just relish in each other's love without all the insecurity.
•So my mom is going to visit my sister at college for her birthday. Her school is twice as far away as mine and my mother has never once visited me on my birthday (or visited at all). I wish I was adopted into a different family at birth bc my hypocritical mother disgusts me.
•How do I deal with emotional pain without painkillers or alcohol. And don't say therapy or yoga or exercise. Suggestions?
•Nick Rangos has the mustache of a God right now. Sure it's drawn on with sharpie but it's still sexy ;)
•"@where do Au students go to party? : Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?"
Ha. Hahaha. That's adorable.
•Why is there still a gaping hole in the ceiling of the McDowell 3 men's bathroom? It's been 3 weeks since "repairs" (thanks 2fix!) and 2 weeks since "safety inspections." I happen to think that exposed wiring directly above a shower might pose a safety risk.
•I really really like this guy. He is so sweet and warm. Don't let me mess this up!

•@@where do Au students go to party? : "Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?"
you make me facepalm. relax a little. enjoy life
•I'm kinda pissed at the Eagle for not covering the event my club put on in the Tavern last week... Also, you should teach your journalists not to tell someone their event isn't newsworthy. That is very unprofessional and wouldn't fly in the real world.
[Editor's note: In the real world, someone would just not answer your email. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources to cover every event on campus. Thus, we have to prioritize.]
•Why are we friends when we are so fake to each other?
•I hate the fact that you are with your girlfriend although you say you hate hanging out with her. We have been hanging out for a while, either make a choice or stop flirting.
•I really hate you, but I'm still attracted to you. I just want to have crazy hate-sex with you all the time, everywhere. But I shouldn't, because you're a terrible person.
•@"Where are the lesbians on this campus?" the internet
•Lately, I've been going through some major life changes that include my 20th birthday, becoming a legal guardian of my younger brother who has autism, and having a severe allergic reaction that resulted in a brush with death. I don't know how to tell my girlfriend that these are the things that are bothering me because I'm afraid she won't understand or care. What should I do?
•Dear SIS, I'm "glad" that you're enjoying the use of the Katzen atrium. I don't mind the fact that I'm trying to get to class while you're all stuffing your faces, because I know how much you wish you had an atrium of your own. Oh, hold on a minute...
•Anyone else loling at how many times the guy who wrote the anti-Take Back the Night status is shown smiling and shaking maracas in the Eagle's video coverage of the event?
•Has anyone else ever heard of eating cinnamon rolls and chili together?
[Editor's note: Whaaa?]
•I'm sooo excited to see the Wonk City music video.... but actually
•There is no support group for my issues. :(
•We were lying down making out. Things escalated and then he stuck it inside me. I didn't want him to, but it was too late to say no since it was already inside me and I was no longer a virgin. Since I never actually said no, this isn't legally rape. But I never said yes either. AU needs to do more to educate young people on the process of consent.
[Editor's note: Just because you didn't verbalize "no," that doesn't mean it was consensual sex. And just because things started out consensual, that doesn't mean everything is consensual. Consent can be taken away at any time. A medical foundation in Palo Alto has some good information about consent here. 
•I love you so much you have no idea. But I feel like I have to act like I'm not that interested so that you will keep chasing me and keep loving me. I really wish this game would end already and we could just relish in each other's love without all the insecurity.
•So my mom is going to visit my sister at college for her birthday. Her school is twice as far away as mine and my mother has never once visited me on my birthday (or visited at all). I wish I was adopted into a different family at birth bc my hypocritical mother disgusts me.
•How do I deal with emotional pain without painkillers or alcohol. And don't say therapy or yoga or exercise. Suggestions?
•Nick Rangos has the mustache of a God right now. Sure it's drawn on with sharpie but it's still sexy ;)
•"@where do Au students go to party? : Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?"
Ha. Hahaha. That's adorable.
•Why is there still a gaping hole in the ceiling of the McDowell 3 men's bathroom? It's been 3 weeks since "repairs" (thanks 2fix!) and 2 weeks since "safety inspections." I happen to think that exposed wiring directly above a shower might pose a safety risk.
•I really really like this guy. He is so sweet and warm. Don't let me mess this up!
