Former Provost Milton Greenberg died on Aug. 27, according to a memo today from University President Neil Kerwin.
Greenberg served as provost from 1980 to 1993, according to Kerwin’s message to the AU community. Passionate about the practice of teaching and not just administration, Greenberg was also a professor in the School of Public Affairs and devoted much of his work to developing and rewarding high-quality faculty.
“College and university teaching represents more than expertise in a scholarly discipline,” Greenberg once said, according to the memo. “It means that you are privileged to be part of an extended community that constitutes one of the most important professions in the world.”
Greenberg helped establish the Greenberg Ph.D. Seminars for Effective Teaching, which have touched many doctoral students at AU. He also created the yearly Milton and Sonia Greenberg Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Award, which recognizes faculty members who have contributed to the body of knowledge about teaching and creating curriculum.
Greenberg was also an expert on the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act, also known as the “G.I. Bill,” which gave veterans across the country access to federal money to pay for higher education after it was passed in 1944. 
The former provost maintained a strong connection with the school even after his retirement, Kerwin wrote in his memo.
“In addition to his passion for quality higher education, Provost Greenberg was a devoted fan of American University men’s basketball,” Kerwin wrote. “Until his recent illness, he was a fixture at AU Eagles home games. The Greenberg Track, encircling the Reeves Field, is named in Provost Greenberg’s honor.”

Pitches Be Trippin' performing at Acapalooza in 2014.
AU’s four a cappella groups will show off their unique musical styles this Saturday, Sept. 12 at the fall preview concert. The event, which will be held at the Kay Spiritual Life Center, begins at 8:30 p.m. and the doors will open at 8:15 p.m.
According to Hayat Abu-Ghazaleh, the manager of female group Pitches Be Trippin’, each of the four groups will sing two songs.
“We just want to have a strong, energetic performance to get young women interested in a cappella and Pitches Be Trippin’,” Abu-Ghazaleh said. “Our big goal for the semester is to bring variety to our performances.”
Coed group Dime a Dozen will sing “Madness” by Muse and a mashup of “Nobody Love” by Tori Kelly and “Problem” by Ariana Grande. Additionally, all-female group Treble in Paradise will perform a 60s-themed number and a song by Little Mix.
After Saturday’s show, each group will hold performances on and off campus throughout the year. The groups also collaborate with each other and with a cappella clubs from different schools.
According to sophomore member Sean Reynolds, the all-male group On a Sensual Note has taken trips to to sing in Los Angeles and Disney World, and the group is looking into a trip to New Orleans over spring break.
Treble in Paradise recently performed at AU Night at Nationals Park on Aug. 28 and will be returning to the stadium on Sept. 22 to sing the national anthem. During the holidays, members have sung carols at the Walter Reed Medical Center, a facility that treats military veterans, and the group hopes to return again this year.
Despite varied musical interests, which range from pop to classical, members of each group stressed how close they feel to their fellow singers.
“First and foremost we’re friends, and then we’re singers,” Reynolds said. “We don’t take ourselves too seriously.” 
Each a cappella group has a different dynamic, but leaders said they have each found their own way to mesh. The preview concert will allow other students to decide if they could see themselves joining a group, Hannah Johnson, the senior music director of Treble in Paradise, said.
“Dime a Dozen is the only coed group on campus, so that was pretty important to me,” Kaeli Patchen, a sophomore member of Dime a Dozen, said. “We’re a really close family, and we get to hang out with an awesome group of people.”
Members of Pitches be Trippin’ and Treble in Paradise, both of which are all-female groups, said they valued empowering women through their creative expression.
"We have always had a strong female empowerment vibe, singing songs by Mariah Carey, Ariana Grande and Christina Aguilera," Johnson said. "We're really open to anyone who wants to come out."
However, Johnson also wants to encourage a greater a cappella community to grow at AU.
“In the past, a cappella was kind of individual,” Johnson said. “We want to create a community including all of the a cappella groups on campus.”
Everyone is invited to attend the free concert, and students interested in joining Dime a Dozen, Treble in Paradise, On a Sensual Note or Pitches Be Trippin’ will have the opportunity to audition for their desired group on Sunday, Sept. 13.jodonohoe@theeagleonline.com

My grandparents were big fans of Jay Leno. They liked his traditional monologue, his tried-and-true street bits. They think Jimmy Fallon is for “the youth.” Going by those standards, Conan O’Brien is for “the strange.” Jon Stewart was for “the liberal.” David Letterman was for "the cynical." But who is Stephen Colbert for? 
This is the question Colbert strove to answer in the premiere episode of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” which premiered Sept. 8. Much has been made of Colbert leaving his crazed conservative pundit character behind in favor of a more authentic persona. In his first episode on network television, Colbert pushed the envelope just enough to show viewers that he hasn’t lost his satirical bite along the way. 
Some parts of the episode were unabashedly a part of the talk-show trope, especially during Colbert’s interview with George Clooney. There were attempts at deeper conversation, with questions surrounding Clooney’s humanitarian work in Darfur and his much-publicized marriage to lawyer Amal Clooney, as well as a short sequence of videos playing on a fake action film starring Clooney, hilariously named “Decision Strike.” But the segment was mostly fluff, interrupted at one point by the audience’s chants of “Stephen!” I could feel the pure excitement through the screen, threatening to take over the proceedings at any given moment. 
Other segments were more successful because they alluded to Colbert’s previous brand of political satire. An early bit comparing the media’s obsession with Donald Trump to an addiction to Oreos played well with the crowd, who, like myself, had been thirsting to see Colbert’s response to the bombastic Trump. In his interview with Jeb Bush, Colbert was unwilling to let the presidential candidate get away with typical political answers. Colbert threw him some softballs to start, but then compared the Bush brothers’ relationship to the dynamic between himself and his brother Jay, who sat solemnly in the audience. 
“I love my brother, even though we politically differ,” Colbert said during the show. 
Why couldn’t Jeb do the same with George? Jeb tried to slink out of the question, but Colbert waited for a substantive response, unafraid of scaring off other presidential candidates from appearing on the show. I was immediately drawn to Colbert’s commitment to getting something new from his guests, especially when that guest could become America’s next president. 
It was equally as fascinating to witness the moments when the political caricature bled into the host’s real personality, and his willingness to play off of the public’s knowledge of that character. When Jeb commented on the amount of portraits of the host in the newly renovated Ed Sullivan Theater, Colbert aptly responded, “I used to play a narcissistic conservative pundit, now I’m just a narcissist.”
I could see the disappointment in the premiere on social media, mostly from dedicated fans who were struggling with the loss of a persona they looked to for the news every weeknight. Sure, this show doesn’t have the same mission that “Colbert Report” fans know and love. It won’t feel as righteous, nor will it claim to be. But it will be authentic Colbert: absurd, conscientious and sincere. The most beautiful and successful parts of the premiere--the introductory “Star-Spangled Banner” number, the startlingly fresh interview with Bush, the flurry of musical joy in Jon Batiste and Stay Human’s rendition of Sly and the Family Stone’s “Everyday People"-- were the most earnest, a quality that late-night television is desperately lacking. Perhaps that’s who Colbert’s newest endeavor is targeted at--not “the youth” or “the liberal,” but rather, “the earnest.”
