Ryan Gosling prepares for exploration into the unknown as Neil Armstrong in "First Man."
Sending a man to the moon was one of the most difficult and dangerous missions ever attempted in human history. Its toll, in finances and human life, are ever-apparent in “First Man.” So is the cost of Neil Armstrong’s personal journey, one full of pain and tumult. 
“First Man” straps audiences into the cockpit and shoots them hurtling toward the unknown, dark reaches of space over and over again as the Gemini missions and various test procedures carry the film to the impending Apollo 11 mission. Decidedly, the film’s tension peaks somewhere in the second act but its emotional climax carries much more weight than any of the space shuttle scenes could.
Ryan Gosling leads the film as Armstrong and does an outstanding job -- showcasing his now trademarked restraint and layered acting chops. However, the real standout (and Oscar-worthy performance) is Claire Foy, best known for Netflix’s “The Crown,” as Janet Armstrong. Foy brings energy to scenes that oftentimes need it. Her rapport with Gosling starts weak but grows throughout the film as they get more and more screen time together.
Technically, the film is a nauseating marvel. Director Damien Chazelle has previously demonstrated his ability behind the camera with the near Best Picture Winner “La La Land,” and does so again by constraining camera’s perspective to the inside of spaceships and first person views. Chazelle has no fear rocking the camera violently, back and forth, simulating to the best of his ability what the astronauts felt (and making us feel it, too). Jarring and claustrophobic cinematography worked perfectly to create anxiety-induced action scenes.
Composer Justin Hurwitz collaborates once again with Chazelle on this film, and though his score is as fluid and fitting to the epic scale of such a feat, the film works best when it uses less music -- something Chazelle understands and controls well -- sometimes subbing out a piece by Hurwitz in favor of the creaking metal of a spaceship or the beeping alarms of a the telecoms in the dashboard.
“First Man” explores the idea of loss and grief in interesting ways, which pushes the film past what could’ve been another procedural Hollywood space escapade. It is a biopic through and through, but its maintained discussion of the cost of space exploration, its controversy and everything that lead us to the moon makes it a special film.
While “First Man” may not live up to Gosling and Chazelle’s last outing, it is a special film that covers more of what we ought to know about Neil Armstrong’s expedition to where no man has gone before.
Grade: A
“First Man” will be released in theaters Friday, October 12.

AU Club Council (AUCC) announced an amendment to recent policy changes in an email sent to clubs Oct. 4. Now, student clubs are able to charge admission to events when 100 percent of the profits from the event will be donated to a philanthropic organization. 
This change was announced after several clubs voiced their concern regarding the new rules that prohibited  clubs from charging students admission to events funded by AUCC, The Eagle previously reported.
AUCC Chair Brian O’Gara said this change was a result of feedback AUCC heard from student organizations whose programming consisted mainly of philanthropic events.
“We heard feedback from clubs and we realized that if you’re paying once for AUCC funds and then once at the door for charity then you’re technically paying two different causes,” O’Gara said. “So we felt because of that, we should make the shift where if you’re donating 100 percent of the event proceeds to charity you can charge admission.”
Isabella Dominique, the vice president of AU’s NAACP chapter, said she was happy with the policy change as it will allow the organization to host their annual Thanksgiving Dinner and donate the proceeds to SOUL, a nonprofit that offers programs for student-athletes in D.C.
“Because we established this partnership prior to the AUCC policy changes, we were stuck in a ‘pickle’ because we weren't sure how we would get enough non-AU students to attend for the donation to be substantial,” Dominique said. 
Michaela Becconsall, the treasurer of AU’s She’s the First chapter, said she’s happy that AUCC amended the policy but is frustrated that her organization will not be able to keep any of the proceeds from events. She’s the First hosts an annual fundraising gala to benefit girls’ education across the globe as well as other small fundraising events throughout the year.
“We will still keep pushing for the reversal of our inability to keep the profits we raise at events. However, we will still host our events likely as planned this semester,” Becconsall said.  “We will have to find donations for most of the food and other supplies to run the event, which will severely limit how we plan to put it on.” 
Moving forward, AUCC does not think they will be amendeming any more policies this semester, O’Gara said. 
“There’s always the possibility that if Student Activities hears back from a lot of groups about how stuff isn’t working, they’ll switch things at the new semester,” O’Gara said. “But I think for now, in terms of this semester, we’re pretty set.”
The Student Activities office did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the policy change. 
As part of their outreach to clubs, AUCC will be hosting a Pizza and Policy event on Monday, Oct. 15  to discuss their new policy changes with students.

Florence and the Machine performed at the Anthem on Oct. 5 and 6.
The audience was quiet as they hung on to Florence Welch’s every word. The only movement was the flashing of glow-flower headbands in the crowd. Florence grinned and said into the microphone, “If you’re here, it’s probably because you believe in women. Come and rage with us.”
Florence and the Machine played at the Anthem in D.C. on Oct. 5 and 6. Her opening act was Beth Ditto, a singer with a powerhouse voice that seemed to emanate from her entire body. Ditto’s music was powerful and beautiful, as her full-bodied voice worked closely with a loud, grounding kick drum and a grungy bass guitar.
Ditto’s soulful sound was the perfect opener to Florence and the Machine, a group known for their emotional, ethereal and truth-telling music. The group consists of Florence Welch, the lead singer, and her “machine,” eight background musicians who play the harp, guitar, percussion, violin, bass, keyboard, backing vocals, piano and synthesizers.
Florence seemed to get lost in her music and let it fully direct her movements. Barefoot, she ran, leaped and danced around the stage, moving her body to the intricate beats of the various instruments in the “machine.”
The group began playing the hit song from their “Lungs” album from 2008, “Dog Days are Over,” when they suddenly stopped halfway. Florence said into the mic, “I know this is going to be hard, but I am going to need everyone to put their phones away.”
Mimicking Florence, the audience raised their phone-free hands high in the air. Then, the band dove right back into the chorus of the song, and the energy in the room was electric. 
The sound of Florence and the Machine is a mix of electronic, tribal and has an air of Celtic soul. Although Florence entered into an almost trance-like state during her songs, the show was anything but impersonal. Throughout the show, she addressed the audience with messages of love, gratitude and positivity. She also encouraged audience members to engage with one another at multiple points, which they did by holding hands or hugging the person next to them.
Towards the end of the show, Florence ran alongside the railing separating the stage from her fans. She stopped and pulled front row audience members in for an embrace as she sang. Moments later, Florence scaled the railing, jumped down into the crowd and let fans surround her.
Florence was graceful in how she delivered messages. Through her verbal and physical interactions with the crowd, encouragement of the audience to connect and let loose together, and her choices in song, she emphasized the joy of unity and letting go. 
The show ended with an encore. Florence and the Machine took the stage for the final time and wound up the night with their 2009 hit song “Shake It Out.” Florence brought an air of compassion, hope, and release when D.C. seemed to need it the most. 
Her voice rang out, “But it's always darkest before the dawn. Shake it out, shake it out…”

By the time I graduate American University, my accrued debt could potentially buy me a small house. My dad explained this to me in regards to the loan I borrowed from the bank and how it would affect me financially in the long term. He referred to the debt as my mortgage before my actual mortgage.
The expensiveness of college is not a new idea to me. Before even attending college, I heard this rhetoric, that no matter what school one chooses, no one can afford it. I have learned this is not completely true. The affordability of higher education depends on an individual’s situation surrounding their college choice, their current financial standing and most importantly, how generous a university is with their financial aid. 
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) defines financial aid as money from the government that helps you pay for college. Any student who needs monetary assistance from the government to pay for their post-secondary education can apply for financial assistance, yet you will only receive aid if deemed eligible. If you do receive aid, FAFSA then divides it into three different categories: grants, work-study and loans. Grant money does not need to be repaid. Work-study awards must be earned through a campus-provided job. Finally, loan money must be repaid, alongside accrued interest for unsubsidized loans.
While AU prides itself in providing “80 percent of incoming students with financial aid” and that “nearly $85 million in financial aid is awarded to undergraduates per year,” American actually placed eleventh in the category of “Financial Aid Not So Great” by the Princeton Review’s annual college rankings. This ranking reflected the feelings of AU students who responded to a Princeton Review survey. When further examined on Princeton Review’s website, approximately 61 percent of AU undergraduate students will borrow from a loan program.
During my freshman year, I was included in the statistic of students receiving financial aid. I received such a quality aid package that it helped me choose to attend the University. Most of my aid came from a grant I received from AU and then another small portion of it was from outside scholarships. However, in my upcoming sophomore year, I lost almost half of my institutional grant from the previous year.
I lost most of the aid because one question changed my eligibility on the FAFSA. In May of this past year, my second oldest sister graduated from college. FAFSA only sees that my family has one student in college, and on paper, we should be able to afford my tuition. I am one of five children, and while not all of my siblings are dependents, I still witness my parents work hard to provide the life we lead. To stay at AU, I had to take out a large loan and will most likely have to continue taking out loans in the coming years. 
The colleges listed under the “Great Financial Aid” section in the Princeton’s Review are widely known institutions such as Vanderbilt (#1), Yale (#7) and Brown (#17). Ivy League schools have larger endowments and donations than schools such as AU which allows them to provide more aid to their incoming students. 
However, I do believe that the University could be doing more to help students afford their tuition. We may not have the same funding as Ivy League universities, but we do still have AU donors who did give large amounts of money to help better the school. Recently, AU received a $10 million donation from Jeff Sine, an alumnus, to aid in the creation of the bipartisan Sine Institute of Policy and Politics. While the Sine Insitute will be beneficial and serve its purpose, I wish I heard about more large-sum donations going towards financial aid. Even without an Ivy League title, AU itself is also a prestigious college and should reward its students more for their efforts.  
I am privileged to be attending such a distinguished university, yet I have a fellow classmate from high school who had to decline his acceptance to American due to the restrictive cost. From the other stories I have heard around campus, this is not an uncommon occurrence. 
To quantify other students’ experiences surrounding financial aid at AU, I created a Google Form survey where I asked five questions: three required, two optional. I asked, “In a sentence or two, explain your experience and level of satisfaction with your financial aid at AU?” Anny Pena, a sophomore in the School of International Service who responded to the survey, said her financial aid experience at AU has been difficult.
“The first year my financial aid package was not enough, but I had scholarships to cover the cost. As I have entered my second year, I have received less help and it has been frustrating dealing with the new gap presented,” Pena said. “They should ensure that financial aid packages do not change drastically as a student should not be hit with the reality that they need more money for their next semester after their financial aid package arrives late.”
Alongside my concern in paying for college now, my post-graduation goals don’t aid in alleviating my financial concerns. I aspire to become a journalist, a highly competitive and limited career, where “a starting salary is likely to fall between the 10th percentile wage of $20,000 and the 25th percentile wage of $25,720,” according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. If I could realistically save my entire first year’s salary and put it towards paying back my student debt, it would not even begin to cover it. That makes me worry that the adage of pursuing what you are passionate about is not always financially sturdy.
Everyone deserves a quality education, like the one AU is providing, and should be able to pursue what they love, but I cannot help but wonder: at what cost?

The Little Wild Things Curry
Our weekly search for restaurants that probably aren’t on your radar. As young, broke college kids we will bring you our honest reviews of affordable restaurants in dope neighborhoods.
Calling out all veggie lovers, this one’s for you. And even if you aren’t into vegetables, you’ll still be interested in this review. 
After the Festival of India’s exhibit on vegetarianism on the quad, we decided to go for a healthier option this week, and we didn’t have to look very far.
We decided to hit up Beefsteak, which is right by the AU-Tenleytown Metro stop. Created by legendary D.C. chef Jose Andres, Beefsteak puts veggies “center stage.” As soon as you walk in the door, you immediately pick up on the restaurant's environmentally friendly vibe. All the produce here is locally sourced. 
We decided to try The Edan, the Little Wild Things Curry and the Beefsteak Burger. These are the most popular dishes, and get a 100 percent recommendation from us. 
The Edan veggie bowl has so much to offer. It’s filled with quinoa, edamame, zucchini, cilantro sauce, garlic yogurt and cucumber salad. 
The Little Wild Things Curry has rice, lentils, carrots, spring onion blend, kale, kohlrabi, green curry sauce, toasted sesame seeds and radish. 
Our last dish, the Beefsteak Burger, was definitely our favorite. It’s quite simply unlike any burger we’ve ever tried. It’s made from marinated beets, pickled red onions, leaf lettuce, tomatoes, sprouts, vegan chipotle mayo, olive oil and sea salt on an olive oil brioche. Although this burger is entirely meatless, it is topped with a delicious tomato that adds in the extra taste and makes up for the lack of meat. We were skeptical at first too, but you’re going to have to trust us on this one. We also recommend adding avocado to yours if you’re feeling extra hungry. 
We’d describe Beefsteak as a healthier Chipotle that gives you a variety of fresh, locally grown vegetables at your fingertips. The chill environment is similar to that of a cozy coffee shop, and we’d definitely recommend it as a place to hang and study. 
Each table has outlets and USB ports, so you could spend hours there doing work if you, hypothetically, haven’t started studying for any of your exams. The USB ports are also great if you want to post a picture of your awesome food, but your phone is about to die. 
Beefsteak has additional locations such as Dupont Circle and Foggy Bottom. And if you are on the run, they have you covered with their app that is easy for ordering food for pick up. 
We cannot recommend that you try this restaurant and these dishes more, so you need to hurry because their menu is subject to change soon.

Recipe for a microwave egg and cheese sandwich.
Transitioning into living in a college dorm is no easy feat, especially for those of us used to home-cooked meals and an accessible kitchen poised for everything from baked lasagna to an elaborate birthday cake. But when it’s 9:00 a.m. and you have a class in an hour, getting out of bed to run to TDR or braving the line at Einstein’s can be more of a battle than waking up itself. As a self-professed lover of all things easy and healthy, I’ve developed a few dorm room recipes that work within a reasonable timeframe and appease my morning hollow stomach.
You can never go wrong with an egg sandwich, but when Einstein’s has a wait with an unforeseeable end, it can be agonizing to settle for cereal. Lovers of the breakfast staple can find solace in this classic egg and cheese sandwich redesigned to fit your Microfridge unit and tight morning schedule. 
Customize this sandwich however you like! Try it with ham, bacon, sausage or even veggies from Whole Foods or Giant. 

If you’re anything like me, you take pride in healthy breakfast creations that look just as Instagram-worthy as they are delicious. With these two overnight meals, you can fuel both your feed and your stomach with a work of art that takes less than 5 minutes to assemble. 
For Overnight Oats, some of my favorite additions to this meal are either blueberries with vanilla extract, or raisins with honey.


As one of the best breakfast staples, toast is ideal because it requires minimal preparation and can be customized however you desire. Don’t have a toaster in your lounge? Try rice cakes with any of these recipes — for a couple of Dining Dollars you can buy a sleeve of them at the POD Market. 
To add more flavor to the avocado toast, top it off with Trader Joe’s “Everything but the Bagel” seasoning — it will satisfy your salty bagel cravings.

It’s no secret that breakfast is the best meal of the day. With long days packed with classes, projects, clubs and assignments, it’s crucial to fuel our bodies and minds with a healthy breakfast that’ll power us until our next meal. Whether it be a quick piece of toast or an elaborate chia seed pudding decorated with fruits and nuts, there are numerous possibilities for dorm food meals. You never know — utilizing your imagination and a couple simple ingredients may very well lead to a Pinterest-worthy breakfast creation.
