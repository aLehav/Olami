D.C. United booked itself a place in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final with an impressive 2-0 victory over the Chicago Fire at Toyota Park on Aug. 7.
The D.C. soccer team secured a chance at their third cup, aiming to capture the trophy for the first time since 2008.
D.C. United captain Dwayne De Rosario scored the first goal while midfielder Nick DeLeon added the second, giving D.C. their fifth appearance in the final.
Joe Willis, D.C.’s goalkeeper, filled in for regular goalie Bill Hamid, who was busy in the last few weeks helping the U.S. National Team win the CONCACAF Gold Cup.
Head coach Ben Olsen stuck with Willis, leaving Hamid on the bench. Olsen’s decision paid off as Willis shut out the Fire.
Fire attacked throughout the first half, but couldn’t find the back of the net. 
After the play settled down and neither team took command of the action, DeLeon launched a shot towards Chicago goalie Sean Johnson in the 44th minute. Johnson fumbled and De Rosario found himself in front of an open goal, scoring the first goal from about four yards out.
The goal was De Rosario’s sixth of the tournament, putting him at the top of scoring charts. He is likely to stay there since the next 10 players on the list come from teams that have already been eliminated.
Two minutes into the second half, DeLeon helped score again. This time he was on the end of a James Riley cross as the youngster put D.C. United up 2-0 with a cool finish inside the box at the near post.
For the rest of the half, D.C. United played in their own half as the Fire brought on two forwards and applied continual pressure on United with numerous shots on goal.
However, D.C. United refused to budge and held on despite some scary moments. In the 66th minute, Fire forward Juan Luis Anagonó fired a shot from the top of the box, missing only by a few inches.
In the 78th minute, the Fire almost struck again as defender Austin Berry found himself with the loose ball after a scramble inside the box. The shot actually passed Willis, but Fire midfielder Perry Kitchen hustled towards the goal line and was able to clear the ball right before it crossed the line.
D.C. United will play against Real Salt Lake in the 2013 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup on Oct. 1 in Sandy, Utah.

In a grandiose follow-up to his breakout first film “District 9,” Neill Blomkamp once again creates a socially aware movie that attempts to break the boundaries of classism. However, “Elysium” doesn’t hold the same emotional resonance as its predecessor and ends up coming off as a sanctimonious lecture on the moral wrongness of anti-immigration laws.
The movie takes place in a dystopian future in which the poor inhabit a polluted, decaying Earth while the rich live on a floating space station miles above the Earth called Elysium. Elysium is an idyllic paradise where all disease can be cured in a few minutes by private medical machines and everyone dresses like they live in the Hamptons.
Meanwhile much of Earth is made to (none too subtly) look like a Mexican ghetto, with Spanish even being interspersed randomly throughout the dialogue.
In the Los Angeles ghetto, Max DeCosta (Matt Damon, “Promised Land”) is a former car thief who suddenly finds himself with only five days to live after a freak industrial accident causes him to be exposed to lethal amounts of radiation. With few options, he turns to Spider (Wagner Moura, “Father’s Chair”), a sleazy smuggler with a heart of gold who ferries citizens of Earth to Elysium.
In return for a trip to Elysium to heal himself, Max agrees to pull of a dangerous data heist, allowing a metallic exoskeleton to be attached to his spine and brain so that he can download the information. After the data heist goes terribly wrong, Max finds himself with the secrets to Elysium in his head.
The film immediately kicks into high gear, with the Secretary of Defense--played by a frigid-looking Jodie Foster (“Carnage”)--chasing him to keep her planned government coup a secret, psychotic secret police agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley, “The A-Team”) chasing him just to incite a little anarchy and Spider chasing him so he can save everyone on Earth.
Of course, being the selfish anti-hero that he is, Max doesn’t care what anyone wants. The film does try to ground him a bit by playing up a childhood romance with Frey, a nurse with a sick daughter. However, Max’s saint-like redemption story overpowers any attempts to humanize him or even make him likable. Not even Matt Damon’s natural charm can make Max easy to empathize with, because it is so inherently obvious that Max is only a tool for “the greater cause.”
There is a sad lack of development for any of the characters in the film, which is unfortunate considering they got talented stars like Jodie Foster (who is given little to do in the movie other than look intimidating and speak French).
The film’s emphasis on its mythic and epic nature overwhelms any attempts at character depth, with only Sharlto Copley’s character truly standing out among the cast.
Carlto plays the psychotic lunatic Kruger with such gleeful panache that his scenes become some of the most enticing parts of the movie, and certainly the most thrilling. In fact, his cartoonish South African accent only adds to the memorability of the insanely magnetic character, making for one of the best villains of the summer.
“Elysium” is probably one of the most intelligently-written sci-fi movies of the year, despite its penchant for being unsubtle and predictable. Its grim vision of the future recalls profound sci-fi films like “Children of Men,” but still manages to create pulpy action scenes that spur the momentum of the film. 
However, it is still a step below Blomkamp’s previous film “District 9,” which got its message about apartheid and classism across without all the bombast.
While its blockbuster nature might have been its downfall, “Elysium” does not fail to be an imaginative musing on the limits of class boundaries and the capacity of human compassion.

Linda Lovelace, the luminary scion of the American adult industry, was just a mere teenager when she began her short lived career. But that career included one of the most famous and profitable films in the history of pornography that was the slyly titled with a Nixonian satirical edge: “Deep Throat.” 
“Lovelace”is a film by the directors of the Allen Ginsberg’s biopic “Howl,” Rob Epstein and Jerry Friedman, that attempts to tell the rise and decline of Linda Boreman and her tenuous relationship with boyfriend Chuck Traynor (Peter Sarsgaard, “Blue Jasmine”). Boreman eventually donned the stage name Lovelace, for whom the film is named. 
They begin with scenes depicting a kinder side of Lovelace’s story of her reveling in the fame. Linda expresses desires to become an actress in plays and then the films begins to delve into the more unpleasant aspects of the story; domestic violence, manipulation, coercion. 
“Lovelace” is a film which posits Linda Lovelace as a contradiction. Those who know the story going in will feel the weight of the inevitability of every frame action “Lovelace” cloying on their nerves, but will leave disappointed by the anemic quality of its content. Why did the most famous adult actress of her time decide to end her promising career?
Well, it’s not entirely clear if going by the film. None of her exploits into her anti-porn crusaders are chronicled, nor are her experiences in her controversial “Dogarama” films. 
The 70’s schmaltzy production design is admirably well dressed and the cinematography by Eric Alan Edwards (“The Change-Up”) gives the film a beat up look of a Super 8 camera.
Linda Lovelace’s story is all fairly interesting dramatic material and Seyfried was clever casting for her willingness to be an exhibitionst in a film such as Atom Egoyan’s erotic thriller “Chloe,” but the grey area of historical events still is clawing at the seams of the plot. 
The question presented to the audience film is who is the real Linda Lovelace? But the answer is quite unclear and not wholly satisfying. We see a cleverly re-constructed version of the 1972 version of “Deep Throat.” It’s funnier and better produced, with Epstein and Friedman adding more of an indie quirk vibe to the proceeding, than the actual film which is just depressingly dull and decidedly amateurish. 
While laudable for a spirited performance by Seyfried and treating the material with some degree of solemnity, Epstein and Friedman mined for some answers about Linda Lovelace, but came up with what appears to be a forgettable movie-of-the-week.

“The Spectacular Now” is a tween, faintly nostalgic coming-of-age story that tugs at the heartstrings, but offers little substance between the moments of emotional crises.
Penned by the screenwriters of “500 Days of Summer,” “The Spectacular Now” blithely navigates the pitfalls of the high school romance movie. However, director James Ponsoldt’s (“Smashed”) attempts to avoid cliches draws attention away from some of the more powerful subtle moments of the film.
The story is simple. Stutter (Miles Teller, “21 & Over”) is a hard-partying, fun-loving high school senior with no plans for his future. After his girlfriend Cassidy (Brie Larson, “21 Jump Street”) breaks up with him, he meets Aimee (Shailene Woodley, “The Descendants”), a shy and nerdy girl from the same school.
Aimee’s absent mom and her passive personality grabs Stutter’s attention and pity, and he resolves to “rescue” her from her predicament. Eventually--through a series of emotional confrontations and existential crises--Stutter realizes that he is the one who needs rescuing.
“The Spectacular Now” is cute, poignant and charming, despite its blasé premise and unlikable main character. While the love story is center stage for most of the movie, it is far from the most interesting part of the movie. Instead, it is Stutter’s relationships to his bitter mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh, “Synecdoche, New York”) and deadbeat dad (Kyle Chandler, “Zero Dark Thirty”) that makes an engrossing dynamic that isn’t explored enough.
It’s not that screenwriters Scott Neustadter (“500 Days of Summer) and Michael Weber (“The Pink Panther 2”) didn’t try to make the romance compelling. Stutter is the complete opposite of a typical romantic hero--he’s stubborn, brash, rude and self-absorbed.
And Aimee is far from the eccentric and charismatic love interest who “saves” the protagonist with her vibrant personality. In fact, Neustadter and Weber go so out of their way to make sure she doesn’t have any of the quirky characteristics of the manic pixie dream girl that they basically eliminate her personality altogether. Aimee becomes a plot device to the story--an angelic ray of hope at the end of Stutter’s long road to self-fulfillment.
Despite its flaws, “The Spectacular Now” proves to live up to its name. Miles Teller is admirably unlikable throughout the movie, but gives a moving performance as Stutter, a young man facing his flawed philosophy with life. And Woodley’s raw and stripped down performance (literally and figuratively) breathes life into the sometimes poorly written Aimee.
Larson and Leigh also give standout performances as Stutter’s ex-girlfriend and mother, respectively. Larson injects a soulful intelligence into all of her short scenes, and Leigh plays her role with such a weary bitterness that it is discomfiting.
The film’s visuals are warm and earthy, giving a distinctly ‘90s small town vibe that feeds into the nostalgic themes of the film. It’s a visual that many indie rom-coms are echoing nowadays, and while it’s nothing remarkable, it works.
“The Spectacular Now” is a callback to the past, despite being set in the now. Although it does wear a hardened cynicism on its sleeve, the film’s message is undoubtedly optimism. And while its determined optimism for the characters of Stutter and Aimee is touching, it unfortunately turns the film a bland mixture of poignant moments.

Based on the popular young adult novels by Rick Riordan, the series of Percy Jackson books tells the tales of Poseidon’s son and his adventures at Camp Half-Blood. 
Barring any sort of huge debt owed to another school filled with mystical and magical elements, there happens to be a large fanbase for the hellenic tales of Percy’s life. However, the sequel to the 2010 “The Lightning Thief” is still a lackluster fleecing of material from other fantasy films and took no advantage of distinguishing itself to form its own identity.
At the beginning of “Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters,” we’re introduced to four young demigods fleeing through the forest from cyclopes who wish to pound them into dust. The young Talia (Katelyn Mager, “Everything and Everyone”) chooses an act of self sacrifice so the others of their group may retreat to the camp. This selfless kindness creates a tree which in turn shields the camp from all the ne’er do wells and malcontent forces that wish to extinguish those demigods.
Ultimately, when the roguish demigod Luke (Jake Abel, “The Host”), with his merry band of male models, poisons the tree and a mechanical bull begins raiding the camp, Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman, “The Perks of Being a Wallflower”) defeats the bull and eventually must trek with his friends to find the golden fleece and save the camp. 
There’s a whole lot that goes on in “Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters” that’s not worth the trouble establishing. Even if that’s its prerogative, the film doesn’t need to juggle so many threads of plot and character arcs. It’s just a lack of profundity in excess. 
The film exists in a vacuum of boring and it’s a film that doesn’t deliver on its promise of monsters in the sea in the plural sense. There’s one in the sea. That’s it. That could be perceived as a completely childish demand, but when the title doesn’t match the product, no one is getting their money’s worth.
The large ensemble of actors from Sean Bean to Pierce Brosnan as well as director Chris Columbus who set off the Harry Potter franchise, don’t return for this sophomore effort either. 
Director Thor Freudenthal’s (“Diary of a Wimpy Kid”) execution of the material is rather anonymous and there are no personal touches to distinguish “Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters” from the ocean of other languishing family fantasies such as “The Seeker: The Dark is Rising” and “The Golden Compass.” 
A stained glass sequence involving the retelling of how three Olympian gods defeated Chronos is about the most engaging material in “Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters.” In fact, it’s too engaging to be lumped in a film like this and would fit quite comfortably within the wheelhouse of Guillermo Del Toro’s “Hellboy” series.
So the search for the next franchise worthy golden calf continues and the band played on, half heartedly.
