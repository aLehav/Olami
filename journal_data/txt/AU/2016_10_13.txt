This November, across all 50 states, Americans will vote for a candidate for president. These people have traveled all around America, spending money, time and effort to win your vote. Although they disagree on many issues, each organized candidates have kept their arguing to a respectful minimum, in an effort to focus on themselves and the issues. That’s right, this election year Americans will vote for Green Party presidential candidate, activist and Doctor Jill Stein and Libertarian Party presidential candidate and past New Mexico Governor, Gary Johnson!
  If you're like most Americans and don’t know who Johnson or Stein are, that’s perfectly okay. It's not your fault there has been a distinct lack of media coverage for these candidates. However, if you’re a political WONK or a third party supporter, then chances are you know exactly who they are.
  Throughout this election, I have been shamed for sharing which third party candidate I will be voting for. The problem is that most of the shaming does not have to do with my candidate’s ideals or policies, but rather it is due to the fact that they are running for office to begin with. Although it may be evident on my online social media, offline and in person I have tried to keep my opinions to myself. 
However, friends, family and some professors have personally called me out and told me that my vote is either wasted, or indirectly supporting the candidate they dislike. Both Trump and Clinton supporters have used the same argument, saying that by not supporting their candidate that third party voters are supporting the candidate they specifically hate. While hate is a strong word, it seems appropriate to describe this election cycle.
  It’s understandable for voters to vote for a candidate they believe to be the lesser of two evils, however, that said, voting for a candidate that someone believes in is definitely something that should be pondered first. For me, along with many other Americans, voting third party is an investment in the future. Although the odds are heavily stacked against us, voting was never supposed to be about supporting a winner, but about actively organizing and supporting our ideals.
  The argument has been made that voting third party is a privilege. So far voting Democrat on American University’s campus seems like a privilege, with a heavily liberal leaning voice. Although third party voters would like to be accepted, many are instead shamed online and on campus. The same shaming can probably be seen at the many heavily conservative colleges in America. The fact that voting itself is looked at as a privilege is undemocratic. Many who perpetuate the argument usually cite race or economic inequality as a reason to vote for their candidate, saying that their nominee is the only chance in saving people of color or those from poor backgrounds. 
However, when looking at Clinton and Trump’s records and policies, both seem to care very little about both people of color and those from a low economic status. Both have supported the war in Iraq and increasing military intervention across the Middle East. Trump advocates for waterboarding, deporting and a downpour of bombing across the Middle East. 
Clinton hasn’t really touched upon her plans for the Middle East during the campaign, however, she has shown them extensively during her time as Secretary of State through helping to tear apart the Middle East and causing destabilization in countries such as Libya and Syria, thus giving rise to ISIS and fueling the refugee crisis. Clinton even approved drone strikes, which continue to kill many innocent bystanders, via her smartphone. 
Another country affected close to home is Honduras. Taking into account both Trump and Clinton’s records and views, it seems that privilege would be voting for either two party candidates, and turning a blind eye to the awful and violent policies they have and will continue to support. Although both Johnson and Stein have struggled extensively sharing their knowledge of foreign policy, both have actively supported anti military intervention.
  According to Real Clear Politics, evaluating the polls of Fox New, NBC, Bloomberg and 10 other well-known news sources, around 10 percent of Americans will be voting for either Stein or Johnson this election year. Last week both candidates were left out of the debate, due to a lack for either being able to achieve a 15 percent polling average from three major news organizations, something that even Clinton supporter Sen. Bernie Sanders said was too high. In effect, 10 percent of the nation was silenced during both presidential debates, which is run by both Republicans and Democrats.
  This election I have made my choice for which candidate I will be voting for. It’s perfectly fine to vote for Trump or Clinton this election if you want. However voting for either Jill Stein or Garry Johnson is not a wasted vote, protest or a privileged vote. This election does not just regard the presidency, but includes many local public offices. Voting on a local level for third party candidates or independents should not be discouraged as well. Picking on third party candidates is a petty and last minute act of desperation that both parties are trying force on the American public, and needs to stop. 
Purely pressuring people into voting for your candidate only annoys them, and doesn't change anybody's mind. If you want to convince someone to vote for your candidate then do it with respect. Find a common ground and refrain from name calling. That being said, here are links attached to both Dr. Jill Stein and Gov. Gary Johnson’s campaign sites, if you would like to learn more.

This is a reprint of an article that first appeared in The Blackprint on Oct. 11. The original post can be viewed here. 
Nate Parker’s film Birth of a Nation, about Nat Turner’s 1800s slave rebellion, was released nationwide on Friday. Parker’s directorial debut has been at the center of controversy for months when his previous rape allegations gained widespread media attention. 
People who want to support the film are also weary of the way Parker has addressed his past are at a crossroads: should they see the film? Are they condoning rape culture if they support this actor? Are they harming black art by not buying a ticket? The Blackprint e-board sat down to talk about the storm surrounding Birth of a Nation on social media and the larger conversations that have come with it. 
What are the details behind Parker’s 1999 rape allegations when he attended Penn State? 
When Parker was a student at Pennsylvania State University, he and his friend Jean Celestin, who co-wrote the movie’s script, were accused of rape. Both Parker and Celestin claim that they had consensual sex with the accuser, who committed suicide in 2012. While Parker was exonerated, Celestin was found guilty and sentenced to serve six months. Celestin was later released when victim was no longer available to testify at his retrial. 
Jenna Caldwell, Engagement Editor: In his testimonial from the case, Parker says he was contacted by his accuser 50 days after they had intercourse, and she was in fear that she may be pregnant because her period was late. She simply wanted to call him and let him know. The day after this call occurred, she reported the incident as rape. According to court records, Nate Parker said she never appeared to be drunk, nor was she drinking around him. She appeared to be sober throughout the entire incident. He also believed she simply wanted to turn this into a rape case because she was in fear of having a multiracial child and being rejected by her parents. Parker says his involvement was consensual and she was upset he didn’t use a condom. 
Taryn Daniels, Editor-in-Chief: There are a few problems with that. The first thing that stood out to me was the removed way he was talking. But he did raise a valid issue [in his testimony]  - how the cop was very aggressive when Nate was making his statement. I guess the implication was that he was a black man, an athlete, and already assumed that he was guilty. 
Elisha Brown, Editor: My big issue with the testimonials is that they took a lot time to build up to their telling of the rape. They were  building this narrative of innocence. I know the stereotype of the Black brute-ish athlete is a real stereotype that Taryn brought up is pervasive, but it seemed like they were passing the blame. 
Taryn: He’s also talking about her like she’s not smart. Instead of being genuinely concerned when talking to the girl,  his mentality is, How do I get rid of this problem?
Jenna: I understand the part where he didn’t want to apologize. It would be an admission of guilt -  almost like he did rape her. But from today’s point of view, him simply not wanting to speak about the rape case during an interview is troubling. It’s understandable for him to say he doesn't want to apologize, but he does have to say something. A simple,‘I do apologize if I was unaware of what consent was at the time,’ could do. 
Lauren Lumpkin, Editor: If Nate was more open about what happened, it could help people have a better conversation about rape culture and what happens on college campuses. The truth is rape is a tricky thing and the details aren’t always clear. So instead of talking about rape and consent and working these issues out, we choose not to talk about it at all. 
How has the definition of consent has changed since 1999? 
Janell Roberts, Blackprint Promotions: [The exposure of] rape on campus changes depending on racial ideology, if we’re being realistic here. I remember looking at the coverage of Brock Turner case, then discussing how the Spelman rape story was completely ignored...If you’re a black woman in society who’s been raped or molested, you’re less likely to even being acknowledged. You’re pushed to the side. I’m not saying that’s for all cases, but it’s for the majority. 
Taryn: I don’t know if I wholeheartedly agree with that, but I think there is a difference in the handling of cases depending on race. It’s hard to determine what happens to the survivors. Being in that situation is already a weird mind space and this country is already not good at handling [rape cases]. If there’s a black perpetrator, there is a lot of tainted coverage...We immediately vilify black men. It’s also  hard to be a student on campus when you’re in that atmosphere. It really makes you wonder what you would do if it happened to you. 
Elisha: I’m not saying I disagree, but I think we’re talking hypotheticals here. Barely any women report their rape at all. Or even sexual harassment cases. As far as comparisons between 1999 and today, I think it’s better -- people are starting to report. On our campus for instance, reports have gone up. People say that’s horrible, but now we have more resources like a Title IX officer. We still need resources, but at least people are coming forward. 
Lauren: What we see now is a gap between past and the present - we’re having more candid conversations about rape that wouldn’t have happened 10, 20 years ago... Rape has been happening forever and it's unfortunate that we are only now holding attackers accountable. When you think about the 90s when Parker was in college, what happened was...maybe he didn’t think it was rape. But right now he knows better. We need to educate ourselves better. 
Jenna: The biggest issue with the 1999 case is that matter of what consent means and them not being able to follow consent because they were uneducated. It reminds me of a project I did in grade school called Sadie Nash, in Newark, New Jersey, which is a city with primarily black people. We walked around and asked black men if they could define consent for us. Alarmingly, a majority of people were not able to. Now when you start college, at least at American, we must take sessions on consent and rape culture. This is something I don’t think could’ve happened in 1999. 
What was the impact of Parker’s press tour for Birth of a Nation? 
The actor spoke to Hollywood trade publications Deadline and Variety in August to pre-empt questioning about his past. The interviews backfired and brought the rape case to the attention of mainstream media and audience. In the week leading up to the wide release of the film, Parker appeared on  60 Minutes and Good Morning America to promote the movie. He was visibly uncomfortable when GMA’s Robin Roberts’ asked about the rape allegations and his refusal to apologize for his actions. 
Janell: In his Ebony interview, Nate used toxic masculinity and his male privilege to justify why these incidents happen. It seemed nonchalant, like he didn’t care. To be in man in society with such a huge platform, you should really use it to reveal the cruel and unusual punishments of rape victims. One thing that really stood out to me was he was asked about consent: 
 “When I think back to 1999, I think about being a 19-year-old kid and, with all due respect, objectifying them. I have never thought about consent as a definition, especially as I do now.” 
Like he said all of that, but there was not a single apology...it comes off as arrogant. 
Elisha: I agree. While some of the things he said seemed genuine, like his push for people to talk about consent more, one thing that got lost is that [in the article] he said he hasn’t thought about the incident in 17 years. How could you not think about something like that? 
I think he’s really messing up with his television appearances. Last Monday [during GMA] he was super defensive with his body language. He was like, ‘well yeah, I talked about that already last night with Anderson Cooper [on 60 minutes]’ - in like an edited, pre recorded interview...you don’t get to just bury this issue under the rug. We understand you’re also a black man in Hollywood - that’s hard, we get that. But he’s completely pivoting to his whole narrative of, ‘I’m a black man who has been smeared.’ That’s controversial. As black women, we could all be biased. But it seems a little tiresome.
Should he apologize or does it not even matter? Is it too late?
Jenna: I think the issue with him apologizing is that it would be an admission of guilt. I don’t think it would be in his best interest to apologize. If he did, he would be villainized by the media - although he already is. I guess there's no great outcome either way. 
Will you see the film? 
Taryn: I don’t think I’m gonna see it… it breeds an interesting narrative [slave narratives] amongst people who aren’t African-American. We need to start creating things that are a little different than that. 
Lauren: I think I will see the movie. I’m also tired of slave movies, but I knew about Nat Turner and his story before this movie was a thing. For that reason, I do want to see the movie. There are also so many people in entertainment who have done terrible things. I think if I were to boycott every person in the entertainment industry who has done something awful, then there would be a lot of movies and TV shows that I wouldn’t be watching.

D.C. held its annual Art All Night: Made in DC event on Sept. 24. Art All Night is the city’s free overnight art festival that begins in the afternoon on Saturday and runs into the early hours of Sunday morning. The festival unites the neighborhoods of Tenleytown, Dupont Circle, Shaw, Congress Heights, Van Ness, North Capitol and H Street in a night of visual and performing arts. The evening features artists of all mediums such as painting, photography, fashion, music, sculpture and poetry. In honor of the Made in D.C. partnership, an initiative that promotes small businesses in the city, the festival exclusively showcased the art of D.C. natives. 
The evening kicked off at 4 p.m. with a “pre-party” in the Shaw neighborhood. The pre-party was highlighted by a performance from La Cirque de la Nuit, a troupe of more than 25 aerialists, jugglers and gymnasts. For those who did not attend the pre-party, their night began at the Embassy Row Hotel in Dupont Circle. Upon entering, guests could choose between a sprawling ballroom with a DJ or an elevator ride to the rooftop terrace where visual artist MASRAE presented a light projection show on the terrace’s pool. The projections seemed to be synchronized with the DJ’s mix of pop and electronic music. Throughout the night, artists walked around the terrace along with models wearing paper-mâché dresses, which guests were invited to paint.
While many attendees enjoyed the lightshow and D.C. skyline from the hotel’s rooftop, venues all around the city exhibited sculptures, music and paintings, among a variety of other performances. At the Embassy of the Ivory Coast, visitors could view intricately carved wooden masks and taste wine of the country as a DJ played traditional, upbeat music. In other neighborhoods, such as Congress Heights, various restaurants stayed open late for old-school dance parties with vinyl records or glow-in-the-dark silent discos. In addition to art performances, some venues featured lecture and panel discussions on current issues like police brutality and the 2016 presidential campaign.
Throughout the night, guests of Art All Night ventured into and across the city to experience the plethora of free events. The residents and artists of the District’s many neighborhoods united in an exploration of art and in discussion of the issues facing the city and world.

I believe it is appropriate, and even ironic due to the fact we attend American University, to discuss America. Gallup polls have questioned the average United States citizen asking, “How proud are you to be an American – extremely proud, very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud or not at all proud?” Based off of this polling, the percentage of Americans to answer ‘extremely proud’ has dropped from 70 percent in 2003 to 52 percent this year. Not only is this an 18 percent drop, but this is the lowest number that has ever been polled.
Much of the negativity that has recently permeated the country is due to renewed conversations on the effects of extensive military involvement abroad, the decline in rank of our education and healthcare systems, and our mass incarceration rates that are the highest in the world. Although there is an abundant amount of other statistics that could further confirm the state of ‘mayhem’ that the United States currently resides in, I will attempt to reverse some of this negativity by demonstrating the many ways the United States still remains number one.
Despite recent economic recession and stagnant growth, we still have the world’s largest GDP. According to the World Bank, our GDP last year was 17.95 trillion dollars. Second place was China at 10.87 trillion. Our GDP is higher than third place Japan, fourth place Germany, fifth place United Kingdom, sixth place France, seventh place India and eighth place Italy combined. Somehow, someway, the United States remains the economic powerhouse of the world. Along with the GDP, the United States household spending is the highest in the world. We consume over 25 percent of the world’s household consumption. One out of every four goods that are consumed go to someone in the United States. This makes us the number one consumer market in the world – and by far.
We also help feed the world. When it comes to overall food production, we lag behind China and India. Our country does lead in corn production and other specific foods, but when it comes to overall food production we rank third. Under the topic of food exports, the United States takes the lead. We export $118.3 billion worth of food every year, more than any other country. That being said, even though America is notorious for having high rates of obesity, every two years at the Olympics we show just how fit we are. We have the most gold medals (1,022), the most silver medals (794), the most bronze medals (704) and the most medals total (2,520). Our gold medal count is higher than the total medal count of every other country, not including the former Soviet Union.
The military remains the most well-funded military to ever inhabit the earth. The military spending dwindled from $700 billion to the $600 billion that it averages around now. This extreme expense allows for technological advancement and progress to outperform any of our expectations. We were the first country to create a nuclear weapon and continue to innovate when it comes to our military might. On top of this, our defense spending outdoes the next 20 countries on the list combined. Furthermore, when we think about the United States and its work abroad, we must remember that we are the country that contributes to more foreign aid than any other nation. 34 billion dollars in foreign aid is distributed to over 100 different nations. The nation we currently give the most federal aid to is Israel. Just about half of the nations worldwide receive the benefit of U.S. foreign aid.
Just taking a look around the American University campus, this next piece should not be a surprise. Students from foreign countries flock to colleges and universities in the United States because of the quality of education this country provides. The United States holds 181 of the top 750 best universities in the world, compared to second place China which consists of 57 of the top 750 top universities. Even when it comes to music, films, literature or any other part of American culture, we tend to have the most global influence in the world. Any country you visit will most likely play music and watch movies that originate from the United States.
So, if I were to ever be polled with the question of, “How proud are you to be an American – extremely proud, very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud or not at all proud,” I would firmly answer extremely proud. We may have our setbacks and flaws, but looking at how far we have come and where we stand in the world today, the United States is the greatest country in the world.

Donald Glover is either genius or crazy. Or both. Probably both.
Episode seven of the FX hit Atlanta does the complete opposite of what anyone expected. After one of the most serious episodes of the season last week, which saw Van (Zazie Beetz) lose her job, Donald Glover and company decided to do a sketch comedy, Charlie Rose show parody episode. While nearly every bit of the show is laugh out loud funny, I can’t help but question if now was the right time to throw a cog in the wheel. By creating a show that goes against the rules of black-centric television, and then to go against that formula, is something completely gutsy and unprecedented. Sure, comedies will have Christmas themed episodes or episodes that place the characters in some alternate timeline, but I have never seen a show stray as far from their routine as this week.
Centering around Paper Boi’s (Brian Tyree Henry) appearance on a talkshow on the “Black American Network,” the episode goes from witty and thought-provoking conversations about race and gender to parody commercials that focus on popular African American items. A fake commercial about an upscale malt liquor is really funny, but it’s simply not the reason I tune into Atlanta. While the animated cereal commercial featuring a police officer brutalizing a black version of the rabbit from Trix is both sobering and humorous, it doesn’t make me care more about the characters that I love.
The conversation between the two panelists on the parody Charlie Rose show, “Montague,” Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) and fellow guest, the transgender activist Deborah Holt (Mary Kraft) is the most Atlanta that the episode gets. The rapper makes the point that many in the African-American community have made it unfair to criticize their community for not being vocal advocates of LBGTQ rights because in many ways African-Americans face just as much discrimination. While Paper Boi is not against equality, he admits that it makes him feel weird, a sentiment echoed by some in the real world rap community.  
In a vacuum, this episode was enjoyable and hilarious. The skit about a black guy transitioning over to being a white guy by saying staples of white male twenty-somethings like “what IPA do you have on tap?” and “did you see Game of Thrones last night?” was incredibly funny, despite not being totally original. The Chappelle’s Show influence is loud and proud on this episode. Glover, who wrote and directed the episode, proves yet again that not only is he totally in touch with black culture, but he is in touch with the genres that he dabbles in. Assuming that this is a one off, Atlanta continues to show its range and almost unrivaled ability to make viewers think and laugh.
Grade: B
Atlanta is on Tuesdays this Fall at 10pm (ET) on FX and available to stream at FXNOW

Students, faculty and administrators gathered in the Katzen Arts Center on Sept. 20 to discuss issues of racism on campus.
As the University continues to address racial discrimination on campus, several faculty members have expressed frustration with the diversity and inclusion sessions the administration has encouraged them to attend.
Diversity and inclusion sessions that faculty members are strongly encouraged to attend are simply not doing enough to tackle the issues at hand, said professor of philosophy Richard Sha. These latest frustrations come in the wake of the racially fueled incidents on campus, which have caused widespread protest and dissatisfaction among the AU population.
“On the one hand I think [the session] was well intentioned,” Sha said. “On the other hand it’s not clear to me whether you can, through training, eradicate the problem. Unconscious bias is probably something deeply submerged and the idea that in a 90 minute training session you would correct this problem…that seems to me absurd.”
The training, which takes place during the academic year, comes as part of a package of courses offered by the Human Resources Department titled WLD Diversity and Inclusion courses. Faculty are strongly encouraged to attend the one of the five classes, which range from ‘Exploring Intercultural Communication’ to ‘Unconscious Bias’ training.
The Unconscious Bias training addresses how underlying assumptions influence our everyday decision-making, and the way in which they affect our thoughts, actions, interactions and decisions. Sessions are approximately 90 minutes long, with around 20 to 30 faculty members in attendance, according to Sha. 
Sha described the training as interactive, with one exercise involving faculty members being given a number of identity categories on paper and being asked to give one up in each round until there was only one left. They then were asked why they had chosen to keep this element of their identity.
“I think the most glaring thing for me was that we never named the problem,” Theresa Runstedtler, an associate professor of history said after attending the training. “We came into the Unconscious Bias sessions, and we were talking about all the different ways in which we identify ourselves, and identity and the way in which that can blind us to certain types of privileges, but we never actually sat down and said hey, this is what’s going on on campus, let’s name it. Let’s call it racism, let’s call it sexism. Let’s call it what it is and then let’s go from there.”
A lack of addressing the issue was not the only problem brought to light, as some faculty showed little interest in the training, according to journalism professor Angie Chuang.
“I have witnessed faculty going to the Unconscious Bias training and not taking it seriously,” Chuang said. “There were people grading papers at the back of the room, I mean everything that we tell our students not to do.”
Chuang said there have also been reports of racial insensitivity among faculty members, raising questions concerning the underlying structural tensions within the faculty.
“Subtle bias or assumptions that maybe the faculty aren’t aware of occur all the time,” said Chuang. “I know faculty who have left AU or chosen not to take a job at AU because the perception was that the environment wasn’t welcoming to faculty or staff of color, and you know, it breaks my heart when that happens.” 
The need for a deeper understanding of the serious topics at hand for both faculty and students, and acknowledgement that there is still progress to be made in these areas is a recurring concern among some of the faculty, Chuang said.
“I think all faculty, just like the students, have really different experiences with race, at very different levels and we’re all at different places with this issue.” she said. “I think we need to acknowledge that to start with.”
Beth Muha, assistant vice president of Human Resources, helped to coordinate the training for faculty members.
“I think they do a really nice job of creating a space where people can talk about bias not from a defensive perspective, but more of a discovery perspective,” she said.
She also said that she had never witnessed any inappropriate behaviour from staff during the sessions. 
“It’s a great course and we get wonderful evaluations,” Muha said. “I’ve never seen anybody mock any part of it when I’ve participated.”
Last week some of the faculty took the issue into their own hands, with faculty members in the Critical Race, Gender, and Cultural Studies Collaborative (CRGC) and the Humanities Lab working group, Races, Empires & Diasporas (RED) publishing an open letter in The Eagle containing 110 staff signatures, condemning recent racist incidents on campus.  The letter pledged its “support for students of color in this time of tension and stress” and said it was “committed to working with students on strategies for achieving many of the points of action that have been enumerated at public events.”
Signatories wrote that they are planning to help the Black Student Alliance achieve the seven actions they demanded in a statement following the recent racist activities on campus. 
“At first we started writing recommendations,” Chuang said, who was one of the faculty members to draft the letter. “But we stopped and said wait a minute. The students have spoken and what they have are seven recommendations and we should really support them because this is their struggle.”
Other members of faculty have also voiced their concerns, including adjunct leader in the Department of Literature Michael Moreno, who published an article on the online media platform ‘Medium’ where he made reference to the racism on campus, as well as recounting an “attempt to normalise or echo racist rhetoric” by a teacher at an Unconscious Bias workshop.
Runstedtler, who is also chair of the Critical Race, Gender and Cultural Studies Collaborative, was a leading voice in initiating and writing the faculty letter.
“I think that we wanted to come together as a group, not as agents for the University but as a collective group of concerned faculty, to say we are behind you in your outrage and support the efforts you are making to raise this as a real issue and a systemic issue on campus,” she said.

Ed Harris in Westworld. Photo from HBO. 
This week’s episode of HBO’s sprawling sci-fi Western focuses on the idea of memory and history for those involved in the creation of Westworld, while still advancing the tired plot of malfunctioning A.I. The episode focuses around different hosts who are experiencing memory, something that has been explicitly removed from their code previously.“Chestnut” introduces new characters William (Jimmi Simpson) and Logan (Ben Barnes), who are business associates with opposite personalities, with yet-to-be-clear motivations for visiting the park. While Simpson, who has blown up since first appearing in Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and Barnes are convincing in their parts, their characters are cookie cutter and simple. Logan is an obnoxious jerk whose bad intentions are not-so-cleverly conveyed by his black cowboy hat, while William’s virtuous traits are illustrated by his white one. Without any backstory or interesting moments for the two, it is hard to find a reason to be invested in their journey.
The Man in Black embarks on a quest to find a maze that may reveal some of the hidden truths of Westworld. It’s a traditional storyline, but one that is made intriguing by Ed Harris’ gritty portrayal. Seeing him shoot and stab his way through the park is cool to watch, but without the element of danger (park visitors cannot be hurt by the “hosts”), it is hard to see how the action serves as anything more than visually appealing. The fact that he has been visiting the park for 30 years and has yet to either find the maze or grow bored of having his way with the characters raises questions I’m not sure will be answered.
The legendary Anthony Hopkins, who plays Dr. Ford, the forward-thinking, mild-eccentric creative director of the park, serves as the show’s most philosophical and worldly character. He seeks to improve the experience of the park by offering visitors wholly new experiences, ones that promise a “glimpse of who they could be.” While the idea of a new, groundbreaking storyline in the world is intriguing, without interesting and engaging guests, the show will only be able to offer little more than a dumbed down Game of Thrones story without the beloved and fully realized characters.
While romance between characters on television often walks the line between forced and believable, the out-of-the-blue love scene between Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) and the totally unlikeable Cullen (Sidse Babett Knudsen) is bizarre at best. Nothing leading up to the moment signalled any sort of love connection, so regardless of the plot implications, there is little reason to do anything but laugh at the moment.
As more details emerge about why the A.I. seems to be malfunctioning and becoming self-aware, the lore of the show has become more interesting than the present day. Questions about Maeve Millay’s (Thandie Newton) past encounter with The Man in Black are more gripping than played out themes of questioning reality. Once the show begins to shift focus from the sci-fi tropes that it currently engages in and into the history of the park, then there will be more of a reason to invest time and energy into the show’s beautiful world.
