The Australian Open began Jan. 16 in Melbourne. The Australian Open is the debut of the Grand Slam season, hosting World No. 1s and former World No. 1s. This year’s former World No. 1s are Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal who competed in Melbourne. 
Maryland native Frances Tiafoe was eliminated in the fourth round of the Open after being defeated by Russian righthander Karen Khachanov,  6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (9). The match led to a tiebreak, but unfortunately for Tiafoe, Khachanov won the tiebreak 9-7.
Growing up in Hyattsville, a city 30 minutes outside of Washington, D.C., Tiafoe grew up with a love for tennis after spending time in a Maryland tennis center, where his father was employed as a custodian. 
Tiafoe advanced further than his fellow American, Taylor Fritz. Fritz lost to Australian righthander, Alexei Popyrin, 6-7(4), 7-6(2), 6-4, 6-7(6), 6-2, in the second round. 
Jessica Pegula did not have such a quick exit. Pegula dominated the courts until her downfall against former World No. 1, Victoria Azarenka, in the fourth round. The third seed, Pegula, lost to Azarenka, 6-4 6-1. 
Pegula did not disappoint the United States throughout the Australian Open. Pegula, who is the highest-ranked American woman in the tournament, advanced farther than Fritz, the highest-ranked American man in the tournament. Pegula advanced to the quarter finals, 
while Fritz only made it to the second round.
Pegula is currently the women’s World No. 4 after playing in the Australian Open. Prior to the Open, her career high was No. 3. She is currently ranked as the top American tennis player. Ranking two spots above Coco Gauff. Hopefully, as the Grand Slam season progresses, the third seed will gain more recognition for her talent. 
American Tommy Paul went up against Australian Open title champion Djokovic in the semi-finals. The face off was unexpected, yet former World No. 1 Djokovic dominated the match, winning 7-5, 6-1, 6-2. Djokovic took home his tenth Australian Open title this year. 
The Australian Open means Grand Slam season is here, and with performances such as Paul’s and Pegula’s, Americans may be dominating this season.

American University President Sylvia Burwell spoke alongside Ron Daniels, president of Johns Hopkins University, and Taffye Benson Clayton, the vice president of inclusion and diversity for Auburn University, on the intricacies of free expression at universities with the goal of maintaining an inclusive and safe environment during a panel on Feb. 1 hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center.
The revised version of AU’s Freedom of Expression and Expressive Conduct policy was released in August 2022, which was a part of focus of the conversation around free speech. 
Burwell said the three key components of the new policy were nuance, practice in context, and values and mission, a part of the policy she continued to return to in the discussion.
“You have to consider those [components] in the context of values,” Burwell said. “What are the values we all hold? And that we are one community whether it is in the classroom, if it is in protests and having policies and approaches that are connected to your values.” 
Burwell said she hopes to see AU students focus on inclusion along with freedom of speech. 
“We believe we can't be a great university if we aren't inclusive, and ‘inclusive’ includes everything from issues of race, to disability, to the issues of our conservatives on campus and how they feel in the setting,” Burwell said.
Clayton discussed the importance of educating students on freedom of expression not being in conflict with inclusion, following a report from the Knight Foundation and Gallup demonstrating that college students believe otherwise.
Eighty-one percent of college students reported believing they should be exposed to all types of speech, even if it is offensive, but 76 percent of all students said diversity and inclusion frequently or occasionally come into conflict with free speech rights, according to the report.
With these findings in mind, Clayton said the approach to free speech on campuses must be inclusive and differentiated.
“Inclusive in the sense that everyone is included under the tent, and differentiated meaning we must be able to speak to the needs of diverse segments of the population very authentically,” Clayton said.
Daniels said it is the responsibility of university leaders to equip students to have difficult conversations with those of dissenting viewpoints by being committed to creating a space for that.
He called out educators who said there had not been enough done in regards to cultivating these environments for students and offered a solution of organizing speaker events featuring debates of conflicting views. 
Bamidele Idaomi, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, is a founding member of the Bipartisan Group of AU who attended the event. He explained this policy came at an opportune time as polarization continues to grow across the country and on college campuses.
“I think it's very good that universities are putting in the effort to making sure that there are some type of inclusive thoughts when it comes to different aisles of perspective,” Idaomi said.

The American University Washington College of Law hosted a virtual teach-in on where the country can go after the death of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was killed after being beaten by five Memphis police officers.
Roger Fairfax, the dean and a professor at WCL, moderated the discussion, which included Angela J. Davis, WCL distinguished professor of law; Kareem Jordan, associate professor in the School of Public Affairs; Angi Porter, assistant professor of law in WCL and Brian Williams, associate professor of public policy at the University of Virginia.
The panelists discussed what AU community members can do in order to bring an end to police violence against Black Americans in the U.S.
Much of the call to action that the panelists articulated centered around becoming involved in policy changes at local and state levels.
“Everybody can’t do everything, but we can all do something,” Davis said.
Part of the “something” Davis mentioned were her ideas on defunding police and allocating those funds to community groups that are better equipped to support individuals who are mentally ill or facing substance use disorder in the community.
Porter added that along with shrinking police force budgets, there needs to be an entire reorganization effort with an interdisciplinary approach toward creating more extensive police training.
She said that throughout all of this work, there needs to be a return to studying the history of oppression and activism to avoid the dangers that come with being detached from the successes and failures of the past.
“It’s going to take sustained study as we act,” Porter said.
Jordan said changing the racial makeup of police, as some suggest as a solution, will not fix the problem, but instead a restructuring of the entire system must be undertaken.
“They have no business to be doing what they are doing,” Jordan said of continued police violence.
He said most crime is intraracial, as to urge people to dispel the myth of Black-on-Black crime being more prevalent. He also called on those in attendance to stop ignoring the everyday slights racial minorities experience at the hands of the police.
“Am I selfish for not wanting to die before I see the progress?” Jordan said.
Williams brought the issue of polarization to the table and argued to create brave spaces where people with different points of view can hold candid conversations.
“The days of compromise are the days of old,” Williams said.

Senior NFL writer and ESPN Contributor Jason Reid visited American University’s Washington College of Law on Feb. 1 to celebrate his book, “The Rise of the Black Quarterback: What It Means for America,” published last August, and to kick off Black History Month at the college. 
The event was put together by WCL’s Sports in Society Initiative and its director, professor N. Jeremi Duru. Duru praised Reid as “the best in the country at covering the intersection between race and sport.” 
Reid and Duru’s conversation started on the topic of what it is like to be a Black quarterback in the United States. Reid said that the quarterback is an icon, something that is larger than life in American sports, but also that “[the] quarterback is a uniquely American leadership position.” 
Both Reid and Duru mentioned the Super Bowl that Doug Williams won with Washington, the first Black quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl in NFL history,an event that set some pieces in motion for more racial equity in the NFL today. Reid went on to ask that if Black men are excluded from this leadership position, what does it mean for the rest of American society? 
Currently, there is a long list of Black franchise quarterbacks in the NFL. Reid specifically named Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs, who is the youngest player ever with a Super Bowl ring and to be named a Super Bowl MVP; Dak Prescott of the Dallas Cowboys; Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens, who is the second ever unanimous MVP in league history; and Kyler Murray of the Arizona Cardinals, among others. In the past, white players were the only ones chosen to lead their teams as quarterbacks. Now, Reid welcomes the era of the Black quarterback. 
Reid directed the audience’s attention to this year’s NFL draft class and to next year’s as well. He mentioned that Bryce Young, C.J. Stroud and possibly Hendon Hooker from Alabama, Ohio State and Tennessee, respectively, are likely going to be starting for teams and be the franchise’s face come the beginning of next season. He also said that “within the next 5-10 years, I think we will see 12-15 Black quarterbacks as franchise faces in the NFL.” 
The conversation then pivoted to Reid and Duru discussing the pain many Black quarterbacks have had in the past, specifically in their upbringing in football through youth games into college football. 
Duru put emphasis on the “psychic pain” of Black high school and college quarterbacks who, up until the mid-1980s, were forced to give up their position in order to take their career to the next level. At the time, few NFL teams were willing to have a Black man as the face of their franchise. 
Reid and Duru also discussed the story of Pro Football Hall of Famer Warren Moon, who, in the late 1970s, was denied a career as a starting quarterback by the then-winning Cowboys. The first question executives asked the NFL scout when he suggested drafting Moon was: “Does he know he’ll have to change positions?”
Moon went on to win many awards in the NFL in the 1980s as a quarterback with the Houston Oilers after playing in Canada for multiple years before. That begs the question that there might have been many other players that could have been Black players that shifted their skills to not play as a quarterback, but could have been fantastic quarterbacks in the league.
Duru and Reid wrapped up their conversation by taking a few questions from those in attendance. One of the questions asked concerned Black quarterbacks that are not superstars in the league, and if they face a higher hurdle to success in the league or not. Reid answered, bringing up some experience he’s had with the hiring systems in the NFL, and how that the coaching system is based on nepotism.
He also noted that sometimes these Black quarterbacks are in better positions to get coaching jobs but many times are overlooked for other candidates. There are still multiple examples of Black men breaking through and becoming coaches in the NFL, such as Mike Tomlin, Brian Flores and new Houston Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans. 
This panel comes on the heels of Championship Weekend in the NFL, seeing the Chiefs defeat the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20, and the Philadelphia Eagles blow out the San Francisco 49ers by a score of 31-7. This Super Bowl will be the first in history to feature two Black quarterbacks facing off against each other, with those two quarterbacks being Mahomes from the Chiefs and Jalen Hurts from the Eagles. Mahomes and Hurts both succeeded white franchise quarterbacks on their teams, proving a point to Reid’s definition of the era of the Black quarterback.
This Super Bowl may be the first to feature two Black quarterbacks, but Reid emphasized that it will be far from the last. 
“These two men are not the first capable Black quarterbacks to do this, but the first with the opportunity to do so,” Reid said.

Men's basketball took down Colgate on Feb. 4, handing the Raiders their first Patriot League loss in 27 games.
The American University men’s basketball team (15-8) had its biggest upset victory since their win against Georgetown this Saturday evening in Bender Arena. The Eagles took on the Colgate Raiders (17-8), who held the nation’s longest conference winning streak of 27 games and were undefeated in the Patriot League.
American was coming off a close loss from the last-ranked team in the Patriot League, the Bucknell Bison. AU had previously lost to Colgate last month by a single point and were looking for redemption in their second matchup.
The first half started with neither team able to make the first basket of the game until junior forward Matt Rogers put in a 3-pointer from beyond the arc. Colgate answered with a 3-point basket of their own.
The two teams continued to trade baskets from the 3-point line. Junior forward Johnny O’Neil and sophomore guard Elijah Stephens both added a 3 to the score for the Eagles, while the Raiders matched them, bringing the score to 9-9. 
American did a good job defensively at keeping Colgate out of the paint, causing the Raiders to turn the ball over four times in the first four minutes. Despite this, Colgate was also defensively strong, causing AU to turn the ball over six times in the first five minutes.
“Defense is our main goal,” Rogers said. “The offense will come. We know we can score.”
A steal and a fastbreak spin move layup from junior guard Lorenzo Donadio tied the Eagles and Raiders up 11-11.

Colgate responded with a 6-point run, taking the first lead of the game. A 3-pointer from freshman guard Geoff Sprouse cut the lead to 3. The Raiders continued to push their lead out, growing it up to 11 at one point.
The Eagles continued to fight back, led by junior guard Colin Smalls, who contributed 7 points in the last three minutes, including a fast break dunk, a 3-point basket and a jumper that cut Colgate’s lead to only 4 at the half, 35-31.

Colgate started the second half out strong, scoring their next 8 points in the paint. The Raiders outscored the Eagles 17-6 in the first nine minutes of the game, with the only points for American coming from Stephens in the paint.
Despite the cold shooting from AU, freshman center Jermaine Ballisager Webb threw down a dunk that started an 18-0 run for the Eagles, including an impressive made jumper and free throw from graduate student forward Connor Nelson.

The home crowd in Bender Arena gave the Eagles the energy they needed to take a 5-point lead over the Raiders. A huge 3-pointer from Smalls stretched American’s lead of 1 out to 3 with 17 seconds left.

Colgate had one last opportunity to score, pushing the ball down the court before it was knocked loose by AU. The ball rolled to Colgate, who shot a 3-point attempt at the buzzer, but failed. The Raider’s 27 conference game win streak, the longest one in the nation, had come to an end at the hands of the Eagles, 61-60.
“Every team in our league is good,” head coach Mike Brennan said. “There’s no gimme games, there’s no guarantees. But hats off to Colgate, what they’ve done is a heck of an accomplishment.”
The Eagles were led by Smalls with 17 points, Stephens contributed 11 points and 4 assists, and Rogers added 9 points.
Smalls felt that the Eagles’ work was not done yet.
“We want to get to the Patriot League Tournament. We want to conquer our goal and win the Patriot League Championship,” he said.
American will next take on the Boston University Terriers on Wednesday, Feb. 8.
