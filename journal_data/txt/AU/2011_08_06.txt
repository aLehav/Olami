• I feel so embarrassed when I misspell the word "embarrased."
• I can't wait to get back to school this term, because I've been mostly deprived of frequent smoking, booze and unprotected sex this summer.
• Dear Financial Aid, please use some of our tuition money splurge on a new fax machine. I shouldn't have to send my forms for the third time only to get a message that your office is missing a page (even though the receipt indicated that everything went through.) Get your act together.
• Tim McBride is fine, but they should show off the SG VP more. I don't know her name (Lacey?), but she makes me want to Eagle Rant hardcore.
[Editor’s Note: Her name is Liz.]
• My rant wasn't published. During the summer. Dang Eagle, I feel dissed. : (
• I want to get back and have wonderful conversations with my intelligent professors already!!!!!!!
• What a joy to find someone else who thinks this way.
• Even during summer vacation, my Facebook/Twitter pages are filled with sarcastic and obnoxious political comments. #cantescape
P.S. Hashtags are a terrible/fun disease … kind of like gonorrhea.
• I had no idea how to approach this before — now I'm locked and loaded.
• So I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to painkillers. FML
• I wish people in my city would observe the D.C. escalator rule of stand on the right and walk on the left.
• How come every wedding I go to I get really excited about, and then the wedding ends up being no fun at all?
• So I tattled on my professor and the professor found out. Awkward turtle …
• I really wish there were more purses available that weren't leather. Why do people think it's okay to kill animals to make handbags? There are plenty of other materials, you know.
• When is AU going to develop a dating site. OkCupid = best way to meet a significant other (and friends too).
• Wish AU wasn't filled with Pennsylvania's future upper middle class husbands and housewives. Maybe I'd meet cool people.
• I don't know what I want to do with my life anymore. Every time I am 100 percent certain, something happens where I no longer am.
• To the person who criticized me for calling people posting pathetic: I put my Cheetos down and paused World of Warcraft, now it's off to whine some about trivial nothings and decry smokers on campus … oh and before I forget, moan about why I'm so lonely and how I deserve better. And how AU “just doesn't get me.”
Love ya! Keep reading …
- You're still pathetic
• AU isn't just all atheists, join the Gathering at Tuesdays at 7:30 during the summer at the Soho coffee house and 9:00 at Kay during the semester!
P.S. I swear it's not a cult, it just has an unfortunate name! :)
