• If I post something saying "I'm the original ranter, does that make it credible?" (btw original ranter here).
• @"Gay guy who claims vaginal odour is why he’s gay: Uhm, dude, as if ass smells any better? SMH. . ." I mean I was kidding, and yeah ass doesn't smell much better. Two of the lesser evils I guess.
• AU Compliments, AU Crush and AU Confession make AU students look pathetic and insecure. GET OFF ANON AND GO TALK TO PEOPLE. 
• It's like all the dirty hipsters at this school want you to hate them. GO TAKE A SHOWER AND CUT OFF YOUR PONYTAIL.
• Editor, can we put emails here for people to send messages to instead of rants back and forth among a million people?  I'm thinking you might think that people would submit other peoples’ emails, but what if there was a way to verify that it was a person submitting their own? Like you or someone else sent an email asking to check it was intentional.  That would reduce the amount of random responses from “original” posters and vague messages.  That or I’m gonna make a Facebook page or something.  This AU speed dating has to happen.
[Editor’s Note: I recommend making a Facebook page]
• I rant, therefore I am.
• Guys of eagle rants: every guy just randomly puts his hands in his pants when you're just chillin, right? Especially in a comfy chair and especially in comfy clothes.  Whoops, I was studying in the study lounge and realized I had my hands down my pants just chilling like nbd.  I had gone in to rearrange my junk but forgot to withdraw.  Whatevs no one saw...I don't think.
• @awkward library sex: not to be a creep, but like....where and how does this happen?! Ever since "The Prince and Me," I've always been curious
• @"What were people complaining about on the quad today?" I heard mention of The Big Bang Theory and I wholeheartedly support their mission to have it cancelled.
• @"1. HIPSTERS DO NOT LISTEN TO KE$HA SO YOU ARE NOT A HIPSTER"
Methinks the lady doth protest too much.
• @I literally feel completely and utterly alone: that literally sounded as though I wrote it. Try talking to your friends maybe? I talked to mine and I think we might be getting back to normal, but I can't tell. Good luck. <3
• I wonder how many people arrange to meet up with each other over Eagle Rants, then get to their meeting place and don't have the balls to find each other
• I want to stay at AU for grd school but I know going to the same school for undergrad and grad is frowned upon. What other schools would be most similar to AU?
• I think they should bring back puppies on the quad for finals week... Someone get on this!!

• If you're in David Johnson's Digital Skills class and are meh on it, please drop out because I want to take it desperately!
• @ I noticed that too.. It's not a huge deal, but it makes it seem like black people don't want to be friends with anyone else. It's not like they can only find things in common with other black people, our characteristics aren't defined by the color of our skin. everyone should be friends with everyone.
• I'm in Kogod and we are definitely not Ravenclaw. I've actually heard Accounting Majors say "I'm bad at math." LIKE WHAT. We are definitely slytherin. Like I said before, most of us are all corporate tools.
• @"My best “friends” go off and do things without even a thought about me" Story of my freaking life. What I started doing was doing things by myself, it may seem lonely, but I've actually met some cool people that I may not have met before.

• To girl in my fractals class who sits in the front row everyday. I really want to get breakfast and study with you but I am not sure how to ask.

• I love hearing loud opera music from the guy at the table next to me... can you play your music a little louder? It's REALLY helping everyone study
• I'm not a slut...but my philosophy to sex is YOLO so f*** it 
• Based on the rants, isn't it obvious that the problem isn't that there aren't any willing/interested people on campus? The problem is this: you're all too scared to say anything to anyone, and about half of you have set your standards high enough that no one will ever measure up so that you won't have to worry about rejection. There you have it.
• plot twist: not everything is about you
• Kogod is not Ravenclaw. Basically everyone I've met in Kogod is straight up dumb.
• You know you've gone too long without watching Rent when every Christmas song that references Bethlehem makes you want to sing "La Vie Boheme"...

• @YOU ARE ALL WRONG. Okay here’s the breakdown: SOC is Hufflepuff, SIS is Gryffindor, KOGOD is Ravenclaw, CAS is Slytherin. And everyone else is a squib. WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG: CAS is Hufflepuff, SIS is Gryffindor, SOC is Ravenclaw and KOGOD is the disgusting Slytherin.

• Enough of this Harry Potter BS. SPA is House Stark, SIS is House Lannister, KOGOD is just a bunch of Littlefingers, SOC is House Greyjoy, CAS is House Targayrean, Public Safety is the Night's Watch, ROTC are the Unsullied and CAUS are the White Walkers. 
• Liberals R Tools. I know you disapprove of homosexuality, but I'd go gay for you and make you my sex puppet. You are awesome!

• Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends, up there on the sanctuary moon, are walking into a trap, as is your Rebel fleet. It was *I* who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh, I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.

The School of International Service will be expanding the course “Introduction to International Relations Research” from one required semester to two semesters. The class is required for undergraduates to earn with a bachelor’s degree in SIS. 
SIS faculty approved a change in the curriculum in a Nov. 7 vote to increase the requirement as part of a major reform for the SIS program. The change will only affect students entering AU in Fall 2013 or later, said Patrick Jackson, the associate dean for undergraduate education in SIS.
Currently, the course covers how to write a literature review and producing original research.
The new form of the course will teach research design in the first semester while the second semester will cover writing a research paper as well as collecting and analyzing original data, according to Jackson. 
“Students will have the ability to select a section of the second-semester course that most closely corresponds with their topical or methodological interests,” Jackson said. “We'll have second-semester methodology courses like ‘using GIS’ [geographic information systems] and ‘interviewing public officials,’ but also courses like ‘research on seemingly intractable conflicts’ and ‘research on regional integration."
By choosing topics, students will be preparing for later SIS courses, Jackson said.

New sexual assault stickers with blue headers and information for on-the-go students were released by the Wellness Center mid-November.
Information about AU’s Counseling Center and a direct phone line for DC SANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) were not available on outdated posters.
The stickers were replaced in mid-November, according to Daniel Rappaport, AU’s Sexual Assault Prevention Coordinator. 
The redesigned stickers have blue headers and a red border compared to the red headers and red borders on previous stickers.
“I think blue is a little less scary than red,” Rappaport said.
The calmer colors and emphasis on the availability of 24/7 resources were meant to make the information more accessible to everyone, Rappaport said.
In the past, the “medical help” section listed 911 as a contact number for the SANE program at Washington Hospital Center. Now, the phone number for the DC SANE Call Center and a description of the free safe ride to the Washington Hospital Center SANE Program are on the stickers.
The AU Counseling Center was added under the “Resource Available 24/7” section. The center can be reached for an emergency by a student after an incident has been reported to Housing and Dining staff or Public Safety.
The Counseling Center is a confidential service, but a resident assistant or resident director must report a situation once they are told about it in an emergency situation.
A QR code, a scannable image leading to a web page, was added to the stickers and takes students directly to AU’s Sexual Assault Resource website.
“Instead of trying to scribble everything down,” Rappaport said, “now they can use the QR code that will link them directly to the AU resources website.”
