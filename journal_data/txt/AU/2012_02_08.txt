• @"Do girls here masturbate? I'm a sexually frustrated girl due to my LDR, but I would be so embarrassed if my roommate knew I used a vibrator (were I to buy one). Are there more discreet ways to masturbate?"  go to Pleasure Place in Georgetown, get a waterproof vibrator and use in the shower. Bam! problem solved
• @"Why does the Eagle Rant editor get to be anonymous but a sex columnist can’t be?"
KA-POW!
[Editor’s Note: It’s so unfair]
• @"How do you know if you are in love?" love is when you can't imagine living your life without that person. They are in every waking thought you have and every sleeping dream you have. They are the center of your universe. Every decision you make takes them into account. You constantly think of ways to make him/her happy. And you would sacrifice parts of yourself for the other person. That is true love.
• @person making Disney quotes: I love you. Please don't stop.
• @"I want to have sex with a girl somewhere inside MGC" Try the 3rd floor (4th floor if you include TDR as a floor). No one is ever up there.
• @"I"m worried that the counseling center won’t be able to help me, and I have no back up plan." If the counseling center can't help you (or if you feel they aren't helping you in the way you would like) they can give you an outside referral to nearby therapists. I've used both nearby and on campus therapists and both have been very helpful.
• @"Nate Bronstein stole all the forks from TDR."  ...and my heart! (swoon)
• Stop worrying who you will sit next to at commencement. Just sit a stranger. No AU student is going to bite you. We're all one big happy family. Why not make a new friend the day of graduation?
• @person helped by the counseling center. I am so happy for you. I was greatly helped by the counseling center too due to some PTSD issues from an event in my past that kept haunting my dreams. But now I am almost completely better, and have learned to deal with my baggage in more healthy ways.
[Editor’s Note: Go counseling center!]
• when will I outgrow blacking out?? because finding out about my night from pictures on my phone and texts (those that I haven't deleted) is getting old
• @"I kind of agree with the opinion that going to grad school and then immediately starting a family, while fine, seems a bit like a waste. why not take a few years, have a career, travel, do things for you." How is going to grad school not doing things for me? Who else would I be going to grad school for? There is nothing I would want more in my life after college than to go to grad school.
• I can't stop eating. When I AM able to, I feel disgusting and fat.  #firstworldproblems
• So we have gender neutral housing, but not gender neutral bathrooms? Redic. I look forward to the day when all bathrooms are single room stalls and marked with "person" instead of a gender.
• @fetish rants: My fetish is AU students ;) (Wouldn't it be creepy if I weren't an AU student...)
• What is with the ridiculous amount of sex rants on february 7?
• I love how anyone can eagle rant. I go to GW, but my bf goes to AU. He got me hooked on rants. GW doesn't have rants. major fail.
• I read the eagle rants and I'm a grad. student.
• Why doesn't AU open a medical school so that we can raise our school ranking? We have a healthy endowment. And there is a major shortage of doctors in this country. Or at least we could open a DO school.
• Dear Guy from the Gym and Dav.: You wear a tank top and look like you're full of yourself. You resemble Adam Levine, but lose the tank top and put on a shirt. You're a grown ass man. And maybe then maybe mature dudes will wanna hit on you. Until then, you'll be stuck hanging out with boys. not men.
• WTF AUSG job board. So angry I can only speak in A.C.R.O.N.Y.M.S. SMH.
• I don't understand why so many people hate on AU. I love it here and it makes me second guess my happiness when everyone around me is complaining.
• It would be nice if the eagle prevented some of the rampant grammatical mistakes. What's the editing process like if they can't even keep from double printing parts of articles?
• I was kind of hoping you'd read my rant (which was obviously about you and you would know it was about you, it was so damn specific) and rant back, or say something in person. Guess not.
• @how do you know if a girl is gay?:  I think we need a massive gay girl meeting.  As in, Look!  All the lesbians on campus in one place at one time!  They do exist after all!  (I hope.  Still have yet to find any eligible girls.  Sigh.)
• He walks among us, but he is not one of us.
• @"I’m a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits."
Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit...
• Why does everyone keep licking my face??
• @"You’re my best friend. I don’t want to date you right now. But I would like to marry you someday. I hope you understand." - i wish you were him, talking to me.
• *your; it was an honest mistake...... it's definitely not the worst thing i've done
• Hey Eaglesecure, way to load 20% of my YouTube videos and then just stop, dead in the water. Seriously, I never thought I'd see the day where I'd long for the chance to sign up for Comcast.
• Please just tell me if you like me. Or have someone else do it. Whatever works!
• @Commitment issues: Welcome to the club.  It's not so bad; now that you recognize the problem, you can work to overcome it.  Or choose to be friendzoned and just enjoy the friendship.  I personally prefer the second option, but if you seriously want to be in a relationship with this person, don't let your fears hold you back.  Play some cost/benefit and decide what matters to you the most. #support
• I want a pet.
• I haven't seriously done homework in days...
• I hate to be THAT person, but I am overwhelmed by the stress I feel over finding a little. Please like me back!
• I don't think Tim McBride is cute. Bring back Nate Bronstein!
• I honestly do not like AU students. I try to spend as much time off this god-forsaken campus as I actually can. I should have gone to University of Maryland.
• If I find someone in my class attractive, and I want to stir up conversation and eventually hopefully soon lead to a hang out time, How would one go about doing that? I cannot just wait for it to fall and just happen, I like being proactive. (soph girl--->junior guy) ADVICE?
• I am tired of people telling me what to do. I am 19 years on 20 years old and I can make my own decisions whether or not my friends think they are trying to help me or not. If it ends up being a mistake, SO WHAT. That would be a mistake I would have had to made, and had to learn from. (this is probably totally so grammatically incorrect, but, yeah.) THOUGHTS? (p.s., i like when the eagle rant editor posts a little comment at the end of my rant)
[Editor’s Note: oh hey hey]
• #rangosrants?
• "Live together, die alone"
• Stop copying everything we do.
• @Person who wants to talk to cute guy in class but it's random: Story of my life!!! Aah! Why can't it be easier? I just wanna be friends with some cute guys (if nothing more).
• I don't think anyone is saying education is a waste of money or that mothers shouldn't be educated.  But grad school does cost quite a bit of money (and parents are usually less likely to pay for it).  If your goal in life is to be a stay at home mom, you don't need a Master's Degree.  You can get the same education by reading books in the field you want to study, classes at a community college, etc.  Hell I'm currently taking a class at Stanford University on computer programming through iTunes U for free.  Anything is possible
• Dear New RA,
It is 2 am in the morning and there is a JUST DANCE PARTY GOING ON IN THE LOUNGE. Some of us have to sleep. Would it be too much for you to do your job?
Sincerely,
Anderson's Fourth Floor
• Straight girls: how flattered/creeped out would you be if another girl asked you out (under the assumption that you were gay/bi)? I have terrible gaydar, and I just want a date.
• Dear whomever put duct tape on the Anderson 3 elevator, I heard it get stuck. Someone may or may not have been on it. Luckily I was on the outside wondering if the doors were stronger than the tape. The tape won.
• Dear rider upset with the Equestrian Team,
we feel confident that we answer all emails received. However, if  we did miss your email, we apologize - mistakes do happen and we're not perfect. We're sorry to hear you've taken it personally and promise to respond promptly should you reach out to us in the future.
Best,
AU Equestrian
• AU emailed me, wanting me to name them as a beneficiary in my estate. But... I'm a junior. I'd make a joke about how I must be more valuable to AU dead than alive, except that tuition here is so expensive, my "estate" is probably in negative digits.
• @fetishes. I really like toned calf muscles. And being pinned down or against a wall.
• Does AU think it's acceptable to send current students e-mails about donating to the school? Don't they know we're all poor from the price of tuition? They need to stop.
• girl in my calc class with hickeys all over your neck: shut. up.
• “The first casualty of gender-neutral housing”... or this person could live off campus. It is possible for people of different genders to live together. I'm a girl and I live with three guys.
• Mmm, so watery. Yet there's a smack of ham to it!
• ???, where my sistaaz at?!?
• Wait, Hermano means brother?

• What is going in the old McDonalds. It's been SO long and they still haven't announced anything.
• Learned the hard way that I should not have sex with a friend... darn...
• Why is there a dead Pakistani on my couch?
• I'm always down on Greek life but now I'm graduating and feel like I missed out on that part of college.
• I've tried really hard to convince myself that I have decent taste in men, but alas I can no longer deny the fact that Massholes 5 years my elder with GPAs that are approximately half of my own are not ideal suitors. The first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem.
• Can we please put Eagle rants up before 11 pm?
• To the three girls walking at approximately .1 mph side by side taking up the whole sidewalk...I hate you.
• Today is my ex boyfriend's birthday. I totally creeped on him on facebook and he looks like he's a caveman crack addict. Oh, sweet karma
• Can we go back to posting rants in the morning? k thanks
• When will these random boners during lecture end?!
• If your parents paid for your education (or a significant part of it) and want to see you graduate, I think you're obligated to go. It's the least you can do. Different story if you paid for it yourself, of course.
• The Eagle Rants aren't up yet.  You guys should have your pay deducted for being so slow.
[Editor’s Note: pay?]
• Chemistry joke ranter - i want to work on your leucine zipper with my zinc fingers

• Why is there graffiti in the L6S stairwell? You had to make this place more of a sh**hole?
• There was a rant with over 100 words on it on the 2/8/2012 rants. It was a good and uplifting rant and it was only 108, but still.

• I like sex. Sex sex sex. Tralalalala.
• Kimchi~ my love, I'm so glad I have you ^^ now I can regrow any potential amputated limbs as well as fight off the ever rampant 'I-live-in-a-college-dorm'itis. My roommate only makes those faces because she does not understand the deliciousness. =)
Now... where's my dokbokki?
• Someone cook the chicken in TDR! Also stop stealing the forks!
• Real Talk: Is there a scale I can use on campus? The one at the gym is broken and I think I am losing weight. Help a sister out!
• I know it's horrible, but I really want to have sex with my best friend. We just get along so well and have all this sexual tension, I just want to go for it.
• I would actually chop off a boob if it would get my neighbors to stop singing at all hours of the day. KEEP IT DOWN.
• @fetish conversation -- I once read a thread on reddit about a girl who wants to have sex in a bathtub/kiddie pool full of chocolate pudding and now I REALLY want to try that! (sugar free of course--no yeast infections plz!)
• I almost had sex in the park down the street... but then she lost interest...
• It was a dark and stormy night when Senator Smitty Werbermanjenson was to be impeached. But on his way to Ward 5, he disappeared never to be seen again. Some say he died of food poisoning on fried catfish day. He never even got to present his bill. His ghost now wanders MGC 262 in hopes to get his bill passed. He was #1.
• Can we stop calling the pepsi girl "pepsi girl" and start calling her "mark zuckerberg's little sister?"
• SIMMER DOWN NOW
• ONE LOVE

Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, or the two remaining members who call themselves Bone Thugs, focus on a few things: life, death and marijuana.
Life, (as in The Life Entertainment, Krayzie and Wish Bone’s new label) was mentioned at the show more times than the word “bone” is mentioned at the beginning of “Tha Crossroads.” 
Death, as in their dead homies who were the subject of about half the show, which included tributes to Eazy E, Notorious BIG, Tupac and, briefly, Wally, C’s Uncle Charlie and Little Boo. 
Marijuana was the subject of a third of their songs and 80 percent of their stage banter. When he wasn’t talking about weed, Krayzie Bone took a moment to address personnel changes within the group, saying, “no matter what you hear on the news, this [is] Bone.” 
The only problem is that it wasn’t.
Not all of the Thugs were present, as the group has joined the long list of bands that split up into multiple groups in their old age, claiming the same title.
The current lineup, a combination of original Thugs, Krayzie and Wish Bone and The Life Entertainment prodigies is, for better and for worse, stuck in the ’90s. 
Most of the concert was dedicated to showing the good side of being stuck in the past, with Krayzie and Wish Bone leading the crew through a tour of the group’s 1994-97 golden age.
Despite missing a few Thugs, the group performed these songs with the same precision and cohesiveness as the original crew, and, Ludacris be damned, Krayzie proved that he is still the king of speed rap. 
The throw back to their ’90s hits apparently brought a lot of the audience back to their high school days. By the second song, grown men and women were grinding like shameless sophomores at the homecoming dance.
The ’90s throwback turned sour when they decided to play some of their new The Life Entertainment work, which painted a grim late-’90s-soaked future for the label. 
The new material, both from Krayzie Bone and opening acts Dilemma and Dizzy, reeked of the late-’90s bravado, or what should be called the “having things” sub-genre of rap wherein oversized egos talk about all of the things that they have while wearing graphic tees and rhyming “party” and “Bacardi.”
It’s hard to pinpoint the absolute lowest point of the performance, but it’s narrowed down to three possibilities: Dilemma stopping a song because he didn’t know his own lyrics, Dilemma boasting and swagging about his single reaching 5,000 sales or Dizzy’s inspiring command to “put a finger in the air if you have a dream and you’re gonna follow it” right before singing a song wherein he rhymed “Rosé” and “OK” over somebody else’s beat.
Just as Bone Thugs was about to make me forget the opening atrocities with some of their timeless hits, the show ended, abruptly and awkwardly after only about an hour set. 
The fact that it left the audience wanting more was a sign that it was a good concert, but really it was just a too-short set, with peaks exactly where you’d expect them (“Tha Crossroads,” “Body Rott”) and deep, deep valleys elsewhere.

• Dear "my roommate is a moron",
 Me too... me too.
• Dear Roommate,
    If by showing me the eagle rant about "having sex with my roommate" you were implying you wanted to have sex with me, stop. It's never going to happen.
• Dear Roommate,
    Stop dead bolting the door. Haven't you realized I want your Mac Book to be stolen?
• WHY CAN'T I GET A JOB!!!!
• disembowel SG!?! oh, sorry. disassemble SG! there's a thought...
• i can slam a door shut too, just watch... See
• at least there is no limit for eagle rants, unlike the chance my roommate will find someone. Limited
• chew chew chew i'm gonna staple gun your mouth shut
• Why do I always talk to guys that live so far away from here? And yet, I don't seem capable of making a true connection with any guys here anyway... So I guess I shouldn't complain.
• why can't I use %#$@ing profanity for my eagle rant?

[Editor’s Note: THIS.]
• @Person seeking a reading
Hmm, tough question. Maybe we should agree on a meeting place, since I'm fairly sure the editor won't publish e-mails (good thing to).
• To the obviously cute guy in the gym: it is annoying enough to know that you only have looks going for you- but can you please not touch your chest after you lift? It makes you look like an even bigger douche.
• The "Lost" ranter: I love you. Buy me a cup of coffee and we can chat about the Dharma Initiative.
• @Taking oxycodone before class Solution to your problem: give me your oxy.
• Love the rants-where were they when i was in college lo these many years ago!
• Why does the Eagle Rant editor get to be anonymous but a sex columnist can't be?
• I've never been so horny or for so long in my life. I can't even stop fantasizing during lectures.
I hate it how coffee shops serve extremely hot water for tea. I shouldn't have to • wait half an hour just so I don't scald my tongue.
• Why does the Mudbox sell stick-on bindis? I feel like that's offensive...
• I hate the fact that more people here don't like country music. It has something for every feeling and phase in college.
• Aaaand I just made cookie dough. For the purposes of eating as-is, not so much for the cookies. Damn, senior year panic and depression is setting in much earlier than I had anticipated.
• today, eSuds is down and I have no clean underwear left. fml.
• So there is this girl in my class who wears disney shirts all of the time.  I think she is cute
• I keep seeing pepsi girl... I want to ask her to come drink a coke with me one time...
• I'm going to be the one person that complains about TDR food ALL THE TIME.
• Yo, kids in Battelle, this is not the silent floor of the library. Please say something... anything.
• lookin' dapper
• "The first casualty of gender-neutral housing"... idiot, not unless he or she is gay and thus, could have sex with his or her roommate now. Pea brain, expand yo mind.
• Could someone please explain to me how the heck we got two new senators and I heard nothing about a special election??
• Re: "...Gay until proven straight." Although I chuckled when I read it, but I don't act like people wouldn't freak out if someone posted the opposite.
• I love reading rants from abroad! I feel like I'm back at AU every day for 5 minutes.
• "... I’m thinking of asking a guy out on a date…
I’m a girl… is that weird?"
Hell no
• Don't leave your Uncle T-Bag hangin'!
• One of the new roommates in my apartment is a pretty girl and now I'm afraid to poop in my own home. This is terrible.
• Yeah, like I'm going to spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON!
• I'M A MONSTER!!!!!
• Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass!
• WHY ARE NONE OF THE SOUTHSIDE ESUDS MACHINES WORKING?!?! TODAY IS LAUNDRY DAY GODDAMNIT.
• I"m worried that the counseling center won't be able to help me, and I have no back up plan.
• I'm a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits.
• I realize everyone has strong opinions on this baby @ 25 subject, but enough already.  if you want to have a baby and you're happy, go for it. if you don't that's fine too. who cares what everyone else has to say. in my opinion, unless someone pays your bills every month, their opinion is irrelevant.
• living life=getting drunk at a bar?? you're kidding right?
• I think that a guy in one of my classes is really cute but I have no idea how to spark up a conversation with him. It's not that he's intimidating, its just that it would be so random!
• There is no reason to complain about the FWS situation if you don't qualify for work-study. BABYSIT! You'll make more money anyway, and there are plenty of positions that don't require a car. This especially applies to international students since babysitting is almost invariably under the table.
• I love doing homework naked.
• i'm tired of reading the "married at 25" rants! can you please stop posting several rants regarding the same topic?
• Seriously, don't ever ask me to watch your stuff again and come back an hour later.
• re:sitting alone at commencement: I literally know no one in my major. I just realized this. WHO AM I GOING TO WALK WITH?!?!
• @how do you know if a girl is gay?: as a gay girl who really doesn't look gay but tries really hard to make it known, please ask. i just want a date.
• I thought the Dav prided itself on being fair trade, the cool thing, the hipster thing where intellectuals can sip coffee...... but they've been playing Taylor Swift all morning. Ears. Bleeding.
• @The person who thinks having sex with your roommate is a casualty of gender-neutral housing: Sometimes people have sex with their same-sex roommate which has nothing to do with gender-neutral housing....
• @fetish game: I'm turned on by rainbows. And velvet.
• I'm abroad, but I feel like I'm back at AU with these daily rants SIGH
• @married by 24 if you want to be married/have children by the time you're 25, that is your choice and I respect it. However, everyone defending her needs to stop scaring the naysayers by saying that after 25 there's a much lower chance for fertility/making it sound like developmental disabilities become an inevitability; my brother was born when my mom was 36, and I was born when she was 38; she got pregnant naturally and fairly easily, and neither of us have any developmental disabilities.
• Let's jump out a window! T_T
• Seriously guys 10k a year is a drop in the bucket in terms of AU's budget.  Splitting the position in 4 parts and not paying any of them wouldn't work either.  That would make the running of SG even less efficient b/c the 4 heads would have to do so much extra coordinating to make sure they were on the same page.  Too many chefs spoil the pot.
• I wish I had more support.
• I am miserable in law school, but there is no way out now.
• I'm so embarrassed and I can't get over it. What do I do?
• @fetish rants: I have a bubble fetish. I want to have sex in a bath full of bubbles.
• best bathroom graffiti is in ward!!!! MADE MY DaY!
• @"... I’m thinking of asking a guy out on a date…
I’m a girl… is that weird?"
That's not weird at all! My current girlfriend asked me out, and it's by far the best thing that's ever happened to me!
• I really....really.....REALLY hate valentines day.  And it doesn't help that all of my friends love that infernal holiday
• So I posted a few days ago about not having happiness with anything I do anymore. But that's gone! I am doing much better, thanks to surprisingly enough the AU Counseling Center. If you are having thoughts about going, GO. All the sessions are FREE. I think you get up to 8 or 9? Not sure. Also from the support of certain friends. Also journaling has helped too. Ahh. Today was the day when I finally realized that I WILL be alright, and EVERYTHING in the end will sway the way you want it to because you make it that way. Progress with my happiness all the way!
[Editor’s Note: Right on.]
• Every time I get close to dating you, I freak out, act like a child, and start ignoring you. I didn't think having a fear of commitment was a real thing, but I'm seeing more and more that I can't get shake the feeling that something will go horribly, horribly wrong if we date... but I'm absolutely in love with you.
• If my group doesn't get our RCC, I will destroy McDowell. We deserve that suite.
• Have to point this out: it's entirely possible that the roommates who slept together are the same gender and just gay. Same-gender housing only stops hooking up if everyone's straight.
• @Can girls ask guys out? YES! They totally can. Unless the guys is a total jerk, he'll be flattered.
• I hear that you like me.... confirmation would be nice from any valid source.... drunk or sober....
• @ BDSM kitchen fetish--I'm a guy and my fetish is that I would like a woman to peg me.
• Whoever made the Sh*t AU Students say left out complaints over Eagle Secure and the Metro System. SHAME!
• I'm used to being single for Valentine's Day and all, but this year it just seems even more annoying for some reason. Eagle Ranters, will you all be my valentine?
• omg the feb. 6 rants were freaking amazing. There should be an award for how great they were!!
• Please make a sequel to sh*t AU students say. PLEASE!
• @grad school for "just a mom": I wasn't the original poster but I plan on going to grad school and then immediately becoming a stay at home mom as well. I plan on going to grad school for psychology. I am going not only because I enjoy learning about psychology and want to learn more, but also because psychology knowledge will make me a better mother.
• I'm so sad and lonely and anxious that I have started talking to myself. At first it was just when I was alone, but now I have started doing it in public. #scared.
• @why grad school for just a mom: I don't view grad school as a vocational training ground. I view it as a mentally enlightening life experience that everyone should be lucky enough to get. I do not at all consider it a waste of money. Expensive cars and clothes I consider a waste of money. I guess we all have different priorities in life.
• @graduation issues: Graduation is just a ceremony. Not going to graduation does not in any way devalue your degree or make you a bad person. A significant minority of people do not go to graduation because a) it costs money to rent the garb b) it takes forever to go to all the practices and the actual ceremony and c) there are much better things you could spend your time doing.
• That awkward moment when really ugly guys talk about how they wouldn't sleep with a biddie. As if you had a chance!
• @girl asking why a mother would want to grad school if she doesn't plan on working: Higher education makes people parents, better citizens, and better people overall. And maybe she wants security in case she ever does need to work and she is too busy raising kids to go back to school to get a graduate degree.
• So I got cold called in law school and totally blew it. Crying in class = not cool. :(
• @"the person who responded to my “sitting alone at commencement rant” Not going is not an option when my parents pay over $50,000 and are flying to see me graduate." It's not too late to cancel flights. It's only February. Tell them you appreciate their willingness to fly out and see you, but they really don't need to spend the money because you just aren't up for the whole show that is the graduation ceremony.  Tell them you are saving them lots of money.
• @fetish ranter: my fetish is sex in public places ;)
• I feel like all my coping systems are breaking down.
• @"Seems like a waste of money to me if your highest goal is to mother 6 kids": I am not seeing your logic. Please explain. Why would you imply that mothers should not be educated? And I don't view education as a waste of money.
• @"that awkward moment when you get arrested over break and now you’re afraid the school will find out and take away you’re scholarship" How did you get a scholarship in the first place without knowing the difference between your and you're?
• Nate Bronstein stole all the forks from TDR.
• Why does TDR suck?
• I just want to sleep
• Just heard about a very single Anderson Hall President via eagle rants. Mr. President, I offered before but once again, I'd love to be your Monica LeWONKsky ;)
• @"Is anyone going to see that Shel Silverstein show that AU Players is putting on?! It sounds hilarious!"  I'll be there! It does sound hilarious!
• Oh my god. If you're going to talk to your friends in an abnormally loud voice and laugh obnoxiously every minute THEN LEAVE THE FUCKING LIBRARY.
• I kind of agree with the opinion that going to grad school and then immediately starting a family, while fine, seems a bit like a waste. why not take a few years, have a career, travel, do things for you.
• lol au sux
• So an engineering student told me it is better to push the automatic door button rather than manually force them open as it damages the electronic system. Could this be true?
• To the guy who's been ranting in the desperate hope that suddenly he will find out whether or not the girl he's crushing on is available and, if so, whether or not he has a chance with her, I have some advice. Ask her out. I'm serious. Nothing will make you instantly more attractive and even if the answer is no, she should be flattered. If it doesn't, she's not all you thought she was.
• Dear sir, we do not care about your personal opinions on religion or the burqa. You should stop bringing them up.
• this guy i'm sitting next to a phonathon is one sexy catt!
• Grow up. This is all so stupid. Remember what's important and just start being a good person.
