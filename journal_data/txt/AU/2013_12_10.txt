Houseboat tour on the backwaters of Kerala, India.
As difficult as it is to accept, my study abroad is over. I left Manipal four days ago at 5:30 a.m., sent off by my friends and loving resident director, who came bearing hot coffee. I don’t think even my own mother would walk a mile up a hill carrying a pot of coffee at 5 a.m. just to keep me sane on my journey south. As the car rounded the bend, leaving Manipal behind, tears started streaming down my face, the driver clearly uncomfortable with the crying white girl in his back seat.
During my flight to Kochi and the hours that I spent in the fancy hotel waiting for my parents’ arrival from Mumbai, I tried to come to terms with the fact that my study abroad had ended. Had I changed? What had I actually gained? 
My parents and I spent the next couple of days bumming around Fort Cochin, a touristy enclave in the southern state of Kerala. Watching my parents try to adapt to India was hilarious: they were undoubtedly American, smiling and saying hello to each person they passed on the street, looking confused and shell shocked when auto-rickshaw drivers pestered us to get in and not knowing what the different dishes were on menus at restaurants. Each time they didn’t understand what somebody said, they turned and looked at me and I gladly translated Indian English to American English and vice versa.
Our third day there we went on a backwaters tour. For the first time in four months, I was with strangers who were not Indian, which was unnerving in an unexpected way. All were tourists who had been in the country for a month or less, and I couldn’t help but feel a little superior to them as they talked about how crazy the traffic was and other things I had long since gotten used to.
Halfway through the tour, our guide asked us where we were all from. He was confused when he got to me: “You have been in India a long time. I can tell; you understand me better,” he said. I could have died with happiness.
While I am obviously still seeking closure to my abroad experience, traveling with my fresh-off-the-boat parents through this overwhelming country has shown me that I have learned to be Indian, for the most part. On the Delhi Metro this morning, packed like sardines even though it wasn’t even rush hour, I didn’t notice the masses staring until my mom pointed it out. While my parents flinched at every close call on the ride to the airport, I slept through it, unfazed by the obviously unsafe driving. I know how to ignore beggars, touts and people selling just about everything like the best of them. I’ve become all but immune to the smell of urine and sewage. I’ve learned to appreciate the chaos and the hubbub; never will you find a country more alive.
Who knows what I actually learned this study abroad, but I know that India will never be a total puzzle to me again.

Students in Professor Sarah Menke-Fish’s TV Studio Production class will soon have their work aired on the NBC4 website and an NBC channel in early January.
Students in the class have been working to develop a 16-episode show called “Operation W.A.T.E.R.,” which covers environmental and health problems associated with water, according to Quinn Keating, a senior in the School of Communication.
“It took a few weeks for us to decide on this show,” Keating said. “The idea had to be strong enough for us to get 16 episodes out of it, and it had to focus on water.”
The students were given water as their topic due to SOC’s water awareness initiative, according to Keating. A group of SOC professors began to incorporate water issues into their courses to improve understanding of the topic this fall, according to the website. 
The SOC-NBC partnership began five years ago when Menke-Fish was approached by the network. Since 2009, each section of this class has been able to publicly broadcast their work.
“I had submitted one of the shows that our students were producing at the time, and they were very interested,” Menke-Fish said.
Episodes from 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 are available online.
Every student in the class is involved in the production of each episode of the show. Each week, one student in the class becomes the “talent” of the show, in which that student is responsible for coming up with that week’s topic. 
“Each week requires a different level of involvement from each student because of our rotating jobs,” Keating said in an email. “We always try to perform our job as best we can, but some jobs require a little more effort than others.”
Each episode has an in-studio and out-of-studio component.
In the last week of November, the episode focused on oil pollution in water. SOC senior Sara Schillaci and that week’s “talent” performed an out-of-studio component in front of the Potomac River, explaining the issue and the relevance of the issue to the area.
Schillaci’s in-studio component involved showing the effects of oil pollution in water. Using the studio, Schillaci and her classmates created a pseudo laboratory to conduct an experiment. 
Most in studio components involve an experiment, game show or interview, according to Keating.
Aside from the “talent,” Keating said the other rotating in-studio roles include cameras, floor manager and technical director among others.
“By the end of this course, each student should have a working knowledge of every component of the television studio,” Menke-Fish said.
Episodes of “Operation W.A.T.E.R.” will be available to the public on the NBC4 website and on the non-stop NBC channel in early January.
“We have put a lot of work into this series and it is nice to know that we are working to create a quality show that will be viewed by the public, rather than just graded by our professor,” Keating said.

In Shaul Schwarz’s documentary, he follows Edgar Quintero, a member of the band Bukanas de Culiacán, and a police investigator Richi Soto in Juarez, Mexico. Schwarz began as a photojournalist shooting for publications ranging from TIME magazine to Rolling Stone. His new documentary “Narco Cultura” follows the music scene of the Narcocorridos that arose as a result of the Drug War.
The Eagle’s David Kahen-Kashi spoke to Schwarz about the making of the film.
Eagle: How did you find out about “Narco Cultura?”
Shaul Schwarz: I started as a photojournalist and I started covering the violence. I worked in Mexico since the early 2000s on different stories and until [2008] a lot of my Mexican journalist colleagues were calling and telling me, “Dude, you should go to Juarez, you wouldn’t believe it.” So I did and I kind of got in the loop of covering the conflict. There weren’t really too many… foreign journalists going in there and as a freelance journalist who usually gets pigeonholed into stuff, everybody said, “Hey, crazy Shaul’s walking around Mexico making good pictures of the cartel shit.” 
So for two years, suddenly it became simply most of what I was photographing. I think towards the beginning of 2010 I was sick and tired of it. I also kind of felt frustrated. The pictures were actually getting played really well, I published two stories with TIME magazine. So it was really like getting played. 
But it seemed like everybody was under the idea that it’s just a gang war. It’s gang killing gangs, same old shit, it’s Mexico’s drug war. And then I pursued a story with National Geographic magazine, which like most photographers that was kind of my childhood dream to work for the big Geographic, and I knew this was off subject cause usually NatGeo doesn’t cover news stories and conflicts. So I said, “Well, maybe they’ll be more sensitive.”…I got the job and I shot it, and Geographic being geographic, they gave me a much longer time than most publications to actually roam the land. Then one day I was in Tijuana, and this was the day I was like s—t I got to make a movie, I woke up, there was a murder, I went to cover it and then I heard about the music, but I hadn’t actually seen it. I made a date with Bukanas de Culiacán, from the film, to go meet them at a gig in Riverside. And just as I was about to leave there was another murder and the local AP guy said hey you should come photograph this because there are actually people alive, which is weird cause I usually just photograph bodies. So I rushed and I photographed and I was sweaty and I was running and tired and grumpy. I dashed across the border and eventually an hour later, I was at the show because I went out late. And I saw Edgar [Quintero] with a bazooka. My clothes were stinking of murder, it was that literal kind of crossover. I felt like somebody shoved a bat up my head, I was like “Whoa, what the hell happened here?!” I was so pissed. And I saw people I met that morning in Tijuana and they were there totally partying, to what I called “dancing on the blood,” I called my girlfriend and said you won’t believe what I’m seeing. I photographed the shit out of it again and again and again and I went back and I told Geographic I have this amazing thing. And they said, “What’s so special about this guy with a plastic Bazooka? What is the trouble that captures your imagination?” And they were right, to a degree because I realized in that moment that the still pictures are not really going to evoke the feeling I got that day. That did two things: One is I said I think I have to tell this in not still pictures and then I said I gotta make a movie, I’m not a good writer really, and I was very into it, I’ve done short docs before. Then the other thing, it became this thing through the edit of the movie, it was a kind of big guiding light, I wanna feel I wanna cut his juxtaposition like I felt that day.
E: Do the Narcocorridos realize the music they’re selling is not real?
SS: Yeah, that’s actually part of their defense. They give the crowd the product. That’s what they want. That’s La Moda, as they say, that’s fashionable. And they get what they want. I mean the whole looking at Blog Del Narco on YouTube, that’s a little bit because they’re American. They don’t have it in front of their door. For them also as a problem, like he says when he’s in Culiacan, he has that line, “What you write in a garage in L.A. is bullshit.” To them, they need to connect to something that is more tangible, I think. If you take it out of them, I think it’s part of why this genre was created because Mexican-Americans and maybe Latinos as a whole have this huge identity issue that to us we don’t really get to the bottom of. On the one hand they adapt here really well. On the other hand, and I understand it as an immigrant myself, they don’t completely feel American. Edgar, I asked him the first day I met him Mexican or American? He said, “Mexican.” I said, “Oh, you were born in Mexico?” He’s like, “Yeah, I was born in L.A.”
But to some degree, you have these people who sit here and they’re looking at what’s happening south of the border, more than most of us do. But these kids, it takes such a big part and maybe they have family down there or involvement that they’re looking at this and at the end of the day this genre is a way to connect to that.
E: In America there seems to be a preoccupation with the law and in Mexico their media and content seem to be the opposite. Is it because of that disconnected identity?
SS: To be honest, those films get filmed on both sides of the border. I think the glorification has a little bit different styles on both sides of the border. Meaning there’s more people opposed and appalled by it in Mexico because reality bites a little closer, and yes, there’s a lot of fans, but then you’ll hear people really vocal against the U.S., either you know of this culture and you’re apart of it or you kind of don’t know of it. Most people don’t know of it. And then I think, there’s a different style. A couple years ago it didn’t used to be like that. To be a Corrido artist, the biggest you could go was to Mexico City. Today that’s not true. Most Corrido artists, if you’re in Mexico, you want to make it in the L.A., thus in the U.S. A lot of traffickers if they put a song in your hands as a Corrido artist, the best thing you can do is make it a hit in America. Edgar has a little bit of a backspin on why he’s from here. In order to get street cred, he needs to go down there. There’s this kind of cycle that’s created now by this push. It’s definitely strong on both sides of the border. It’s got a little bit of a different face, a little bit, if you will, a cheaper faker more hard hitting style north of the border. But it really kind of spins back and forth. 
This interview has been condensed for style and clarity purposes.
