Any voter who registered at the polls on voting day or had their residency challenged there can check the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics website tonight to see if their vote will be counted. 
These provisional, or “special,” ballots are not originally counted in the results. 
If the website says a voter’s information is incomplete or more identification is needed, they must make an appointment to meet with the Board between now and Friday to submit further proof.
About 35 votes were challenged at the polling place closest to AU, the Metropolitan United Methodist Church, last Tuesday, according to Precinct 9 Captain Lawrence Williams.
Williams, who has been a precinct captain for at least 10 years, said that these were more vote challenges than were made in any elections in recent memory.
