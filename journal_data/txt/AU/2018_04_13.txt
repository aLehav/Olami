The latest shows and movies coming to a screen near you. 

	Based on the popular arcade game of the same name, “Rampage” tells the story of a primatologist named Davis Okoye (Dwayne Johnson), who notices his friend George, who happens to be an albino gorilla, is growing exponentially and getting angrier and angrier because of a mystery serum. The film then sets off with Okoye and Dr. Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris), who previously worked with the company that created this serum and weapon, attempting to save the world and stop a series of different animals who got infected and are destroying the city.  

	“Rampage” is the third collaboration between director Brad Peyton and Dwayne Johnson after “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island” and “San Andreas.” They have seemingly found a comfortable formula to make adequate movies carried by Dwayne Johnson. With “Rampage,” however, it isn’t too hard to realize the laziness of the filmmakers, as they seem to keep making the same film. This film plays out exactly how one would expect: something bad happens in the world and The Rock prevents it from causing any major damage. These conventions don’t work quite work as well here as they do in some of his other recent films like “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle” or even “San Andreas.”

	The movie also struggled to properly balance the monsters with Dwayne Johnson’s storyline. The film cuts back and forth between them and seems like they’re two completely separate movies. The monster set-pieces are too few and far between, and are not wholly satisfying. They’re shot in dark areas, full of ash, cloud, trees and buildings. We get the bare minimum of what these monsters could do, and when it gets close to reaching that potential, the film cuts to Dwayne Johnson trying to get to the city.

	This tug of war really sets the film back. If the filmmakers instead found a way to bridge the two together, the film would become much more cohesive.

	The humor is lackluster, but Johnson and the supporting cast, including Harris and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (who plays Harvey Russell) are noteworthy and make the film watchable. The direction by Peyton is hackneyed; there isn’t any semblance of personality or flair. The visuals won’t wow the audiences either, but they’re good enough and provide some decent eye-candy.

	For audiences who want to see a Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson movie, this might cut the mustard, but it is so mediocre and lazy that it seems soon enough the Peyton/Johnson formula will stop working.

	Grade: D-

	Rampage was released April 12th.

Scott Bass, pictured in May 2017, will step down as provost in June. Six female professors have accused him of discrimination after being denied tenure. 
As Provost Scott Bass prepares to step down after 10 years in his role, six women have accused him of discrimination in the tenure process. They’ve accused him of discriminating against them on the basis of sex, race and age.
As the University’s top academic administrator, Bass has considerable influence over whether a professor receives tenure. However, throughout the process, candidates receive feedback from faculty, both inside and outside of AU, and administrators before they are evaluated by the provost. In a few cases, support received from faculty and administrators throughout the tenure process is not matched by the provost at its end.
For example, Loubna Skalli-Hanna, a former professor in the School of International Service, told The Eagle she received positive evaluations and was recommended for tenure at every point in her process. However, Bass denied Skalli-Hanna tenure because she failed to complete a book. Additionally, he said articles she published during her time at AU “demonstrated a low likelihood that she would be a productive scholar in the future,” according to a court order. 
Another example is the case of Carolyn Brown, a former professor in the School of Communication. In a mid-term evaluation of her, SOC Dean Jeff Rutenbeck expressed concern about Brown’s teaching evaluations and recommended she receive mentoring. When Brown applied for tenure and promotion in October 2016, she received positive evaluations, including a recommendation from SOC Dean Jeff Rutenbeck. However, she learned from Bass in March 2017 that she was denied tenure and promotion. He attributed the denial to her poor teaching evaluations.
On the other hand, there are professors who received the same answer from the provost and lower-level administrators. For example, Jennifer Diascro, a former professor in the School of Public Affairs, received warning signs before her application reached the provost. While she received four out of five positive external reviews, Diascro was denied reappointment by the Department of Government, the dean of SPA and Bass. All three cited the inadequacy of her research and her lack of continued productivity in her field.
Another example is Caren Goldberg, a former assistant professor in the Kogod School of Business. She applied for tenure in the fall of 2012 and was denied in May 2013. Goldberg claims she was denied tenure because of AU’s lack of respect for feminist research. Work published in the feminist journal, “Psychology of Women Quarterly,” was not recognized as “top tier” by the University. However, she was given several warnings during her six-year tenure review process to publish more research and improve her teaching performance, according to a court order. The former dean of the Kogod School of Business, Richard Durand, did not recommend her for reappointment in her fifth and sixth years of tenure review.
After reviewing these cases (in addition to two others presented in our original article), The Eagle questions the difference of opinion between those who evaluate the candidate at early phases of the tenure process and the provost. In the case of Skalli-Hanna and Brown, for example, why were they recommended for tenure at the initial phases in the process and then denied by the provost? Tenure denial can be devastating for our professors and derail their careers. Communication must improve between all of their evaluators so that professors are not pushed along in the process, only to be denied by the provost.  
In a 2015 resolution, the Faculty Senate unanimously approved a resolution on freedom of expression. These tenure discrimination allegations seem to demonstrate that AU’s academic environment might not be the bastion of academic freedom that it declares itself to be. Is the University standing firm as a “place that is open to diverse ideas and free expression,” as the resolution states, when its top academic administrator faces allegations of discrimination? 
As the University recruits its next provost, The Eagle would like the school to honor its commitment to “inclusive excellence,” the title of AU’s two-year diversity and inclusion strategy. The next provost will be responsible for filling empty dean positions, one of those being the School of International Service and the other the School of Professional and Extended Studies. These new deans, with the help of the provost and other stakeholders, will be responsible for recruiting and hiring our faculty members. Prospective faculty, including women and people of color, may not want to work at an institution tainted by discrimination allegations. The next provost must work to build trust between the faculty and the provost.
As students, we also want our current professors -- not just faculty that AU seeks to recruit -- to feel respected and represented in our community. This cannot be accomplished when allegations of discrimination cloud their work environment. They deserve a fair tenure process. If not, we must consider the example that AU is demonstrating for its own budding student-scholars and the higher education community. The next provost must work to repair this reputation and reform the environment that produced it.

For many students, spring break is a week of relaxation, vacations to tropical sites or spending time with family. We all look forward to the post-midterms, mid-semester break. 
However, this doesn’t mean that all students leave campus. Spring break can also be a time to explore D.C., catch up on a semester’s worth of readings or enjoy an empty dorm room. It is also an opportunity for people to work a few extra shifts at work. Some students might not be able to go home because flights are expensive or they live too far away. Other students are required to stay here because they have work or extracurricular obligations. Regardless of the reason, shutting down food services because a large chunk of the AU population leaves campus is a negligent assumption and denies students of a basic need.
There were three dining options open during the break: Starbucks, Subway and the Eagle’s Nest P.O.D. However, meal swipes were not working, so students were forced to use their own money to pay for meals instead of using their meal plans. When students decide to live on campus, cooking and accessibility to grocery stores can be difficult. However, students are not really informed well in advance that they will have to fend for themselves during breaks, and hence struggle. Some students rely primarily on meal swipes and may not be able to afford to eat out or buy a lot of groceries, a problem I faced when I stayed back for break during my freshman year.  
Sophomore McKim Jean-Pierre stayed in her suite during spring break. She said she expected that dining options would be closed.
“It’s interesting because I was staying here to save money, yet seemingly was at risk of wasting a lot of money just to feed myself,” Jean-Pierre said.
I understand that keeping the Terrace Dining Room and other food outlets open during spring break would require the University to pay those workers during that time. However, given  the amount that students pay for housing and dining services at this University, I think that the school should find money to pay TDR workers, or at the very least, allow students to use meal swipes. 
The University must do better in informing students in advance, about hours of operation during school breaks. While flyers were put up around food venues the week before break, at the very least an email should also be sent out. This will allow students planning on staying here for breaks to prepare. Considering some student-athletes are also required to remain on campus, dining options should remain open at least for the first few days of break when they have practice. 
“It kind of seems inconsiderate to make students purchase expensive meal plans and then not accept swipes when the University knows that many students, including athletes, have to stay on campus,” Graciela Rey, a member of the dance team, said.
As an international student who has spent two spring breaks here because I’m from another part of the world and can’t afford a trip, shutting the school down seems like an assumption of privilege. 
For students who have already paid for their dining options and have chosen to primarily eat on campus, that option should remain available to us. I urge the administration to find a way to keep either TDR or the Tavern options open during breaks. At the very least, Subway and the P.O.D. Market must accept to meal swipes so that students have at least something to fall back on.

Ahead of President Sylvia Burwell’s inauguration this week, the Faculty Senate released a memo Wednesday reaffirming their dedication to diversity and inclusion initiatives at the University, especially within class curriculum. However, their statement came with a stipulation: that “increased attention to issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion need not come at the expense of academic freedom,” according to the memo.
The Faculty Senate, consisting of 27 faculty and 2 non-voting members of the administration, has been vocal in recent years about academic freedom in the classroom. In September 2015, they unanimously passed a resolution stating that trigger warnings, or statements that warn listeners of potentially distressing information, should not be a mandated classroom policy. 
The Senate’s reasoning was that it would allow students to “opt out of engaging with texts or concepts, or otherwise not participating in intellectual inquiries,” according to the 2015 resolution.  
In their most recent statement, sent in a campus-wide memo, the Faculty Senate emphasized the importance of student input in curriculum. The Senate suggested that students make their voice heard through already established channels: the Faculty Senate’s Undergraduate Curriculum Committee, Graduate Curriculum Committee, AU Core Committee, Honors Advisory Committee and the Community-Based Research Scholars Advisory Council.
The Senate, currently chaired by professor Andrea Pearson, followed this suggestion with their own reaffirment to diversity and inclusion. 
“The Faculty Senate remains committed to initiatives being developed, to provide more mentors from diverse groups, sensitize colleagues to the needs of our campus’ communities, cultivate empathy and civility across our community, and reinforce the strengths we all gain from the broadest exposure to the human experience,” the statement read. 
However, the resolution also cited the Senate’s concerns about “faculty autonomy” in regards to materials covered in the classroom, a decision they said they did not want solely in the hands of students or administrators. 
“For that reason, we defend the dual principles of professorial responsibility for syllabi content and professorial obligation to engage students in dialogue about competing ideas,” the resolution said.

SOE Dean Cheryl Holcomb-McCoy, right, sits down with interim DCPS Chancellor Amanda Alexander, left
The School of Education hosted AU alumna Amanda Alexander to speak about her new role as the interim chancellor of D.C. Public School (DCPS) on Tuesday as part of the Dean’s Speaker Series. 
Alexander took over as interim chancellor following the February resignation of Antwan Wilson. Wilson’s resignation came after he received criticism for transferring his daughter to a new high school without going through the DCPS lottery system. Before assuming the position of interim chancellor, Alexander served as the chief of elementary schools for DCPS. 
Alexander received her PhD from AU after earning her bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Howard University. Retired AU professor Charles Tesconi, who served as Alexander’s dissertation advisor, introduced Alexander and praised her character and accomplishments.
“I guess it would be a bit too much to say that I’m not surprised that Dr. Alexander is sitting in the chair where she is,” Tesconi said. “She knows her strengths and she knows her limitations. She’s an anchored, centered person. That struck me from the first time we talked.” 
Alexander sat down with Cheryl Holcomb-McCoy, the dean of the School of Education, for an interview in front of the audience. Holcomb-McCoy and Alexander both began their professional careers in education as kindergarten teachers. 
AU impacted her professional career in several ways, Alexander said. 
“[A] valuable lesson that I learned from Charlie [Tesconi] and others was really just the power of public education,” Alexander said. “That is like a civil right for democracy, for this nation of ours to provide free, nonsectarian education for its citizens.”
Alexander emphasized the issues that have garnered most of her attention in the short period she has served as Interim chancellor. 
“One of the key strategic focus areas for us in DCPS … is early literacy,” Alexander said. “And that’s the case because I believe -- and everyone I’m sure in this room can agree -- that acquiring the ability to read is the first major challenge that you overcome in your school career.”
Alexander also said educators need to make a commitment to building a relationship with parents in order to gain their trust.
After Holcomb-McCoy asked about the “very low significant growth as far as reading and math scores” for DCPS students from 2015 to 2017, Alexander responded that she is “not very troubled that scores were stagnant from 2015 to 2017” given that “DCPS over the past ten years has seen gains.” She added that DCPS “has been the fastest improving urban school district” in the U.S.
Toward the end of the event, Alexander offered advice to the School of Education on how it can train the next generation of teachers. 
“Deliver to schools teachers who are ready to teach,” she said. “We need a lot of help with literacy instruction and early literacy instruction, and I’d love to see schools of education really develop a concrete, really strong strand of coursework in literacy for the entire K-12 continuum.”

	Studies have shown that houseplants not only brighten up livings spaces, they’re good for your physical and mental health, too. NASA found that house plants remove toxins from the air, reducing the spread of sickness that comes with communal living spaces. Additionally, the National Center for Biotechnology Information found that indoor plants reduce stress and make one feel more comfortable and relaxed.

	College students don’t always have access to all of the things plants need: adequate sunlight, species-specific plant fo

	od or the space to grow out a large root system. Fortunately, there are some plants that do well in the college environment. The following plants are low-light, hearty and low-maintenance (just in case you forget a watering or two), and can be easily found in a grocery store, gardening center or online.
	

Succulents are great beginner plants because of how easy it is to tell when they need water. When the leaves don’t feel plump or begin to wrinkle after a few days, you know it’s time to water them. They store water in their leaves and do well in low-light conditions, meaning you can put them on your desk rather than near a window. All they need is some arid soil and a little water every few days or when the leaves don’t feel plump or begin to wrinkle. Although cacti are popular succulents, there are many other types that  come in various bright and beautiful colors, so you’re not limited to just green.
	

Lucky bamboo is actually a misnomer: it’s not a bamboo but a dracaena. Dracaena is a diverse genus known for its short ringed stalks and narrow sword-shaped leaves. Regardless, this plant thrives in indirect light, which is when light shines through the window but does not shine directly on the plant, making it perfect for spaces that don’t get a lot of sunlight throughout the day. This plant is relatively maintenance-free especially when grown in water rather than soil, and only needs its water changed every few weeks. Always make sure the roots are covered with water and you’re good to go.
	

Spider plants thrive in rooms that are between 55 to 80 degrees, which is perfect for a college dorm or apartment when the heating might turn off late in the spring. These plants produce long green leaves in a rosette pattern and thrive in moderate indirect sunlight. Although this plant needs to have its soil watered regularly to prevent the tips of its leaves from burning, they are still very low-maintenance. Having a small watering can handy can help you cut back on frequent trips to the sink for water. This plant will also produce “pups,” or small offshoots, after it reaches maturity. These can be transplanted to start new spider plants and  would make a great gift for a friend.
	

The Golden Pothos is great for someone who wants a larger plant in their space, or who has an empty corner to fill rather than a windowsill. Although these plants can grow up to 30 feet in length indoors, regular pruning will make them more compact and manageable. Also called Devil’s Ivy, this plant prefers bright, indirect sunlight. Watering this plant is easy; it only needs water when the leaves start to droop. If watered too often, the roots will rot, so water them well but infrequently so that the roots can dry out between waterings.
	

		Invite spring into your living space with these easy-to-care-for plants. They’ll reduce stress, freshen up the air and make your home feel more inviting. Near AU, one can find many of these plants at Whole Foods and Giant, as well as online. Better yet, reach out to friends and ask if you can get a cutting of their plants to propagate.

The latest shows and movies coming to a screen near you. 

	“Truth or Dare” tells the story of five college students who are partying in an abandoned church in Mexico when they decide to play truth or dare. As soon as they get back home they realize they can’t escape the game, they are forced to either play, or die.

Jeff Wadlow, who previously directed “Kick-Ass 2,” assembles a strong cast including Lucy Hale, Tyler Posey and Violett Beane. They have great on-screen chemistry and elicit some sympathy for their characters and what they’re going through, despite the script not doing them any favors.

	A horror film with a premise like this has room to explore and have some fun. Like the “Final Destination” films, “Truth or Dare” has potential for some really nail-biting sequences. However with the exception of a few scares, the film never really sets itself apart from other teen horrors, and often veers into unoriginal territory.

	That being said, Wadlow directs this film with a sick and twisted sense of humor that surprisingly works. It allows the audience to laugh and find humor in the absurdity of the truth or dare questions. This kind of energy sometimes clashes with the real stakes of the film, especially toward the end. Real, tense situations seem humorous and strange at best, and ultimately make the entire thing less scary. It is worth noting how well the film is able to include blood and gore while still adhering to PG-13 restrictions.

Blumhouse’s “Truth or Dare” also loses a little steam when it gets toward the third act of the film and attempts to wrap up. For a film with four writers, it seems they couldn’t all decide on how to end it, so they just wrote something simply outrageous.

	Grade: C-

	Blumhouse’s “Truth or Dare” was released April 12th

Joaquin Phoenix and Ekaterina Samsonov in Lynne Ramsay's YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HERE, an Amazon Studios release.

	There is nothing particularly boundary-pushing about “You Were Never Really Here,” the newest effort by Scottish director Lynne Ramsay. It is a relatively procedural revenge film chronicling a man with a particular set of skills rescuing a damsel from the clutches of a group of men with sinister intentions (sound familiar?).
However, what makes this feature truly incredible is Ramsay’s willingness to explore the psyche of the anti-hero in lieu of the conventional trappings of the subgenre. The final product is a moving interpretation of what it means to live with crippling post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

	Joe (Joaquin Phoenix) is a veteran and ex-federal agent who suffers from profound nightmares and depression as a result of  PTSD. He is a man of few words, and his grimy, urban surroundings throughout the film create a constant sense of darkness and claustrophobia, making it unclear whether he is trapped or if he chooses this sordid environment as a form of flagellant behavior because of his past.

	He spends his days caring for his senile mother (Judith Roberts) -- whom he loves unconditionally despite her not making it easy for him -- and spends his nights taking on contracts from parents to rescue girls from pedophiles and sex-traffickers. Nothing is explicitly stated and everything is subtly inferred.

	The movie is filled with jarring flashbacks in the form of dreams and post-traumatic episodes that slowly paint a picture of Joe’s background. They expose how Joe has consistently been unable to save people -- or when he tries to help, things go horribly wrong. This theme acts both as a retrospective piecing together of his past and a form of foreshadowing for things to come. Everything from his daily routine of mending hideous wounds and reading books starting with the last page, to his fascination with self-suffocation constructs a portrait of the protagonist without drawing much sympathy.

	There is little moral dilemma in “You Were Never Really Here,” however. While Joe’s  interactions with others are always curt and his chosen occupation as a street vigilante positions him on the wrong side of the law, he is unequivocally the “good guy.” Joe has a slew of skeletons in his closet that make unwelcome appearances in vicious bouts of PTSD, but he is using what little he has left to try and set things right.

	Akin to John Krasinski's recent film “A Quiet Place,” a majority of the plot is delivered through visual storytelling instead of dialogue. All of the major action sequences occur off-screen, but are no less visceral as the gist of the violence is caught from the perspective of security cameras, which all of Joe’s affluent targets conveniently have. Joe’s weapon of choice: your typical hardware store hammer. Ramsay manages to shield the viewer from these barbaric acts of violence, but she also doesn’t pull any punches. Some of the most stomach-churning scenes in the film capture the bloody aftermath of violence instead of the act itself.

	These strange action sequences are consistently anticlimactic, but are also a breath of fresh air from the typical breakneck action sequences in films like “Taken” or “John Wick.” Ramsay will utilize a single shot in some scenes to make the violence seem intimate or will cut between footage from security cameras to make these brutal fights sterile and impersonal -- just another day at the office for Joe.

	“You Were Never Really Here” sometimes crosses over into horror as well. Jonny Greenwood’s dissonant score helps with that effect. This, along with his music for last year’s Academy Award-nominated film “Phantom Thread” are proving that the Radiohead guitarist is a formidable composer in his own right. Moments that stand out are the flashbacks to Joe’s childhood, and the deep, demonic voice that overlays the impending violence that unfolds during these sequences.

	The film’s expository imagery walks on a tightrope between the literal and the surreal. Much of what is learned about Joe’s past is condensed into dread-soaked vignettes that vanish in the blink of an eye. These glimpses are violent rorschach tests that may leave different impressions on viewers.

	Much like the film’s protagonist, there is much more to “You Were Never Really Here” than frightening imagery and brutality. Joe’s past is an albatross around his neck he feels he must bear as a result of his failures. While his choice of work seems to be an attempt to set things right, the job hardly seems fulfilling. It isn’t until Joe comes across Nina (Ekaterina Samsonov), a Senator’s daughter caught up in a sex-trafficking ring, that he once again seems to find purpose.

	Similar to films like “Taxi Driver” and “Leon: The Professional,” Joe takes on a sense of responsibility that can be called everything but paternal. He persists in Nina’s rescue even after he learns she is a part of a much bigger conspiracy, because she has given him new reason to live after suffering crippling losses throughout his life.

	Many things remain unresolved at the end of “You Were Never Really Here,”  including how Joe will deal with the repercussions of the events that end the film. The viewers will see the gravity of the situation once the conspiracy takes hold. None of these things matter, however. Joe is a character fully realized in a way that many filmmakers fail to achieve, but “You Were Never Really Here” is a film that will unfortunately be overlooked (as if it were never here).

	Revenge and redemption are the obvious, but not best words to describe “You Were Never Really Here.” It deals more with the intricacies of depression and how it can leave one destitute. The film creates meaning through a jigsaw puzzle of traumatic snapshots into a troubled man’s past, all leading to a light at the end of the tunnel, a way out for Joe that doesn’t involve looking down the barrel of a gun or at the bottom of a pill bottle.

	“You Were Never Really Here” grapples with depression in an unconventional, nihilistic way. However, through its vicious and horrific imagery, it condenses its barbaric grime into a heartfelt diamond.

	Grade: A

	“You Were Never Really Here” opens in Washington, D.C. on Friday, April 13

	“Aardvark” tells the story of Josh Norman (Zachary Quinto), as he starts to see his therapist Emily (Jenny Slate) again after finding out his brother, Craig (Jon Hamm) is back in town for the first time in 16 years. Josh starts to reveal to Emily that he’s seen his brother on many occasions, masquerading as different people in his life. What Josh doesn’t know is that Emily is dating his brother.

	The film teases some interesting insights about how we deal with loneliness and how everyone perceives and remembers shared experiences differently. Josh is clearly missing his brother, Craig, and has been dealt the worst hand of his life: living alone in a cramped apartment, without anyone to take care of him. His parents died when he was young, and he never had anyone but his brother to turn to. He hallucinates seeing his brother as different people in his life, such as a homeless person, or a police officer. Josh believes that his brother, who is a successful actor, is coming to him to display his greatest acting performance yet.

	Craig on the other hand, felt like he needed to escape town and his family. Part of him blames himself for Josh’s situation, which kept him from seeing his brother. Emily shares some of the loneliness that both brothers have, and is trying to understand and find out ways to better it, not only for them but for herself.

	That being said, the film never really digs deep, instead it hovers on the surface of these issues. Perhaps it was attempting to bring together three different characters and give insight into each of them, but unfortunately most of these insights are half-baked.

	This is more disconcerting when it comes to the treatment of Josh’s mental health. It seems the film is almost struggling to identify with his character and handles his problems in an overly-simplistic way. This seems almost gimmicky, and ultimately weakens the film’s overall messages. This is surprising as it is the beating heart of the film. The movie has some tonal imbalances as well, unable to juggle the dramatic aspects with Josh’s increasingly worrisome hallucinations.

	It comes across as if Brian Shoaf, who wrote and directed the film, didn’t necessarily know what to focus on. The film starts off with some original ideas but soon the viewer realizes that they haven’t received any new insights, and it begins to meander. This is a shame as the performances by the cast are powerful, and offer some much needed weight, but unfortunately not enough to bolster this disappointing film.

	Grade: D+

 Bishop John Fletcher Hurst holds a shovel at the groundbreaking of AU's campus. 
American University will convene a small working group of faculty, staff, an alumnus and an undergraduate student to research AU’s historical ties to slavery, the University announced Wednesday.
Vice President of Campus Life and Inclusive Excellence Fanta Aw decided to establish the group of eight after junior Nickolaus Mack, the opinion editor for The Eagle, wrote an op-ed article claiming that AU’s first president, John Hurst, had ties to slavery. 
Mack’s research indicated that Hurst inherited slaves from his father. This led Mack to declare that AU’s annual Founder’s Day, which celebrated the 125th anniversary of the University this spring, “is a largely dishonest celebration and antithetical to values of the University and the United Methodist Church.” 
Aw said that prior to Mack’s article, the question of AU’s ties to slavery had not yet been presented to her. She began to imagine who could potentially make up the small working group, including the university chaplain, a member of AU’s Antiracist Research & Policy Center and a professor with expertise in the field, after meeting with Mack to discuss his article.
“From my perspective, the way to go about this, like with anything that is research-based, you get people with expertise who can lend their expertise to the question at hand,” Aw said in an interview.
The group’s members include Christine Platt, the managing director of the Antiracist Research & Policy Center, and Sybil Roberts, the incoming director of the African-American and African Diaspora Studies program. University chaplain Mark Schaefer, associate university archivist Leslie Nellis, history professor Malgorzata J. Rymsza-Pawlowska, and Bette Dickerson, a former sociology professor and interim assistant vice president of campus life, have also been named to the group. 
Mack and David Aldridge, an AU alum, reporter for Turner Television Networks and a member of The Eagle’s advisory board, round out the committee. 
A university press release said the group will meet for the first time in April and release findings and recommendations with the AU community no later than September. Aw said the working group’s recommendations, which will be delivered to her, will determine what future steps of action the University will take in response to the findings. 
Mack told The Eagle that in addition to the working group, he would like “the slave residents who lived here on the actual land and the slaves that were owned by the University’s first president” to be commemorated on a monument, memorial or plaque placed on campus.
Although Aw was responsive to Mack’s article, she was also critical of his methods and delivery. 
“I think there are gaps in the research, but that’s not surprising,” Aw told The Eagle. “I think any one of us who would be doing research, if this is not our primary area of research, you pull together what you have, but you really do need to get people with expertise.”
Aw added that it is important for people to remember that AU was founded in the post-slavery era, in 1893. But Mack said he had “always suspected” that the University’s history had ties to slavery because “the Washington, D.C. area, historically, was predominately African American” in the post-slavery era. The D.C. Compensated Emancipation Act, which became law in 1862, freed slaves in the District of Columbia, according to the U.S. Senate’s website.
Mack said he is grateful for Aw’s support and her interest in his research.

Catch the Nats game this Friday at Nationals Park to start the weekend off right.
Don’t let the fear of Jason Voorhees keep you inside all weekend! From the last few events of the Cherry Blossom Festival to (hopefully) some home-runs, there’s plenty to do in D.C. 
Washington Nationals vs. Colorado Rockies
It should be a good day for baseball with no clouds and temperature in the 70s on Friday; there is no better time to get outside and watch the Nationals take on the Rockies. If you’re feeling superstitious, bring a mit to the game to catch fly balls. Start the season off right by supporting the D.C. home team!
Tickets start at $20.

When: April 13, 7:05 p.m.
Metro: Green Line to Navy Yard-Ballpark Station
Newseum Nights: In Bloom
Want to get in the spirit of the season but feel like you have already done every cherry blossom themed event in the district? Head to the Newseum to be immersed in Japanese culture with a local twist. The cherry blossom festival will join in the festivities with attractions such as cherry blossom hair and makeup. Famed Austrian chef Wolfgang Puck presents fine Japanese cuisine complemented by an open bar throughout the night. Make sure to get your own custom haiku before you leave.
This event is 21+.
