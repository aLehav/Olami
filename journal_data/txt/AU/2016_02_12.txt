	Ward 5 D.C. Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie (center) has proposed a bill addressing the city's special police officers (Cuneyt Dil/The Eagle).

	Neighborhood leaders are blasting a D.C. Council bill that would give college police departments in the District the authority to patrol outside campus bounds.

	Last Wednesday, the Spring Valley/Palisades Advisory Neighborhood Commission passed a resolution 6-1 opposing the bill.

	Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie introduced the Special Police Officer Enhanced Security Amendment Act of 2015 back in December 2015. Among other provisions, the bill mandates special police officers in the city undergo additional mental health and behavioral training.

	More controversially, however, a section attached at the end of the legislation allows college police departments to submit a “public safety plan” for approval. Under such a plan, which would need approval from the D.C. police chief, campus police could exercise their authority to enforce a college code of conduct in specifically defined off-campus areas.

	The bill was co-introduced by seven councilmembers, including Ward 3 Councilmember Mary Cheh, giving it enough theoretical support to pass the full 13-member council if it comes before a vote. McDuffie (D-Ward 5) has said that he will hold a hearing on the bill, which is assigned to his Judiciary Committee.

	“We think there’s a number of areas that are overly broad, that are ambiguous, that give us cause for concern with how those provisions are going to be applied,” Commissioner Stephen Gardner said at the ANC meeting. “Students who live off-campus are concerned that having campus police in their neighborhoods will lead to inherent conflicts between student disciplinary rules and D.C. laws”

	D.C.’s liberal marijuana laws could create that kind of conflict. In the District it is legal for a person over 21 to use marijuana on private property. But possession and use of pot violates American University policy, and the bill would extend the ability of campus police to enforce University rules off-campus.

	AU’s external community relations director, Andrew Huff, was present at Wednesday’s neighborhood commission meeting andsaid that the bill is far from what the University wanted.

	“The legislation in its current form is not the intent [of American University],” Huff said at the meeting. “American University and the presidents of other universities have no interest in expanded police power or jurisdiction.”

	If the bill became law, Gardner said he is worried about a possible increase in armed campus police.

	“We think this legislation provides an impetus for campus police officers who do not carry firearms to start carrying firearms,” Gardner said. The prospect of armed campus police officers alarmed Gardner because college police officers do not have to undergo the same kind of training as Metropolitan Police Department officers.

	“There’s a huge discrepancy between the required training of an MPD officer and a campus police officer," Gardner said.

	Conrad DeWitte was the sole commissioner who opposed the ANC’s resolution against the bill.

	“I understand where the universities are coming from in terms of trying to put together as best they can whatever tools they can to help combat noise in the neighborhood,” DeWitte said.

	Other neighboring ANCs that are located near universities in the city have been concerned as well. The Foggy Bottom/West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission, which represents George Washington University, held a special meeting last Wednesday.

	“This legislation is atrocious. It defies any kind of functional government,” Palisades/Spring Valley ANC Chair Thomas Smith said, adding the D.C. Council failed to consult with the ANCs before introducing the legislation.

	“Just for the record, we invited Councilman McDuffie or his staff person to come to our ANC meeting last month to talk about this legislation, and we never heard back,” Smith said.

Correction appended. 
Returning students planning to live in the three new East Campus residence halls this coming fall may not be able move into those dorms before the semester begins. The buildings, originally scheduled to open in August 2016, will possibly be delayed in opening until later in the fall semester according to Christopher Moody, assistant vice president of Housing and Dining Programs. Moody did not give a specific opening date for East Campus, but said he will know within the next two months. 
Until East Campus is ready, dormitories on the main campus will provide one “offline floor”, or a floor that is typically used to house first year students, to temporarily house residents intending to live on East Campus, according to Moody. Those dormitories will potentially include Anderson, Centennial, Clark, Letts, Hughes and Leonard Halls. The temporary rooms will each house two sophomores, or for students seeking a lower priced option, three sophomores.
In the meantime, first-year students will live in triples in the remaining unoccupied rooms in first year dorms. Once the East Campus buildings are complete, HDP will provide moving services to relocate those sophomores to their intended halls. First-year students living in temporary triples will then be de-tripled to the units vacated by the sophomore students. 
“Students who meet the housing application deadlines are confirmed a space,” Moody said. “That includes returning students who meet application deadlines up to our lottery capacity and then new first-year students who deposit by May 1. We’ll be able to confirm that they have a space, but we won’t be able to confirm what kind of space or where beyond that until students actually get into the process and make their own choices.” 
The residence halls on East Campus, named Federal, Constitution and Congressional Hall, will include 590 beds in total, with each room containing two beds and one bathroom, according to Robert van Hoek, the project’s manager. Those buildings are intended to house sophomores, according to the Room Selection Guide released by HDP to the student body. There will also be two academic and administrative buildings connected to each other. 
Those buildings will provide additional instructional and office space for the School of Communication and the Mathematics and Statistics, Computer Science and Physics departments in the College of Arts and Sciences. East Campus will also include an underground parking garage according to the East Campus Fact Sheet posted on the University’s website regarding East Campus.
Prior to the start of the 2015-2016 academic year, HDP expected to house 1600 students from the class of 2019 according to Moody. HDP instead provided housing for 1780 freshmen this past August. HDP anticipates 1700 first-year students for the class of 2020, according to Moody. 
According to Lisa Freeman, Director of Residence Life, HDP will be turning Centennial Hall into a freshman dormitory, which will keep the number of freshmen living in triples at relatively the same level as the 2015-2016 academic year. At the start of this academic year, 330 rooms on campus acted as triples. That number has since decreased to 150 rooms as students have been de-tripled. 
“We had hoped that East Campus, if it had been ready, we would have been able to reduce down the number of triples that new students would live in,” Moody said. “But we’re going to have to stick to a high number again until East Campus does open. We will triple about the same extent that we did this year.”
For incoming juniors and seniors, 400 on campus spaces will be available as in previous years. In the past two previous years, HDP has been able to accommodate additional upperclassmen students who have not made it into those 400 on campus spaces and have been placed on the housing waitlist. However, Moody anticipates that they will not be able to house students on the waiting list this coming academic year due to predictions that HDP will need to house a large number of first and second year students. 
According to the HDP website, the housing process requires three mandatory phases: a housing application, selection of a “group name” and room selection. Students interested in on campus housing should have already filled out the initial housing application by Jan. 29. They will then form a group of roommates, name the group and elect a leader of their group by Feb. 19. Each group will then be assigned a specific date and time to select a room from available housing between Feb. 24 and March 2.
With the current number of available beds compared to the estimated number of students who would like on campus housing, Moody anticipates that approximately 50-60 students will not obtain a space in the room selection process, which he doesn’t consider to be “unusual.” Those students will then fill out a pending preference form, which includes preferred roommates and residence hall.
“There’s lots of people that make decisions after the first selection process that open up space,” Moody said. “We were done with the pending assignments list by early May last year. If in the third step someone doesn’t commit to a room or we run out of room, the third step for them becomes filling out that pending preference form.”
Chelsea Cirruzzo, a current RA in Hughes Hall who intends to obtain another RA position next academic year, believes that once East Campus opens, the area will develop a communal feel similar to that of South Campus for freshmen. 
For the incoming freshman housed in triples, Cirruzzo believes that RAs will need to apply their training specifically to assist those students struggling with difficulties surrounding living with two other students. 
“I think that the school should just be transparent with the fact that people are going to be tripled at first,” Cirruzzo said. “I think there should be additional resources to accommodate those people, because sometimes tripling is not okay for a lot of people. It can be really frustrating for them. It can cause conflict sometimes. I think that the school should be open about that to them and provide the resources they need.”
Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled Chelsea Cirruzzo's name. This version has been updated to reflect that change.

The Center for Environmental Filmmaking in the School of Communication is hosting its fifth annual Eco-Comedy Video Competition in partnership with The Nature Conservancy. 
This year’s theme is “Clean Water”, and the competition organizers are asking entrants to “‘connect the drops’ between clean water and life” by producing a clear but humorous message about the importance of clean water and conservation in general, according to the contest’s announcement on the center’s webpage. Previous years have focused on such topics as climate change and clean air.
“We get around 70 to 100 submissions every year,” according to AU professor Chris Palmer, who created the Center for Environmental Filmmaking 11 years ago upon beginning his residence at the University. He was also the one who started the contest five years ago. “Some of them end up being very good and give people a lot of pleasure.”
Submissions for the competition should be both funny and meaningful, according to the official contest rules posted on the Center for Environmental Filmmaking’s webpage. Entries must be no longer than three minutes including title and credits. Additionally, all entrants must post a link to their video in the comments section on the Eco-Comedy Video Competition of 2016 YouTube video. All entries must be submitted before 11:59 p.m. on March 1. 
A panel of five judges will review the entries and release the names of about six finalists, depending on the judges’ preference, by March 4. The grand prize winner, who will receive $2,000, will be announced at the DC Environmental Film Festival at AU on March 22.
Palmer, the creator of the Center for Environmental Filmmaking, immigrated to the United States in 1972 after an expansive career including service in the Royal Navy. Shortly thereafter, Palmer gained interest in the ecological impact of humans on the world around them. 
“My whole approach to environmental filmmaking is about producing the results,” he said. “Things like swimming with sharks aren’t entirely relevant, since that’s just fun and interesting. What really matters is [whether] the films achieve any impact. Films which have no impact are not worth making.”
Palmer also said he likes to perform stand-up comedy in his free time, a hobby which blended with his passion for filmmaking to form the Eco-Comedy Video Competition.
According to Palmer, the bond between the environment and humor may be unusual at first-glance, but the connection makes sense when people realize the powerful influence which comedy brings to the table.
“When people laugh, they’re healthier, they find life more meaningful,” Palmer said. “Comedy, I think, has a major role to play in changing minds. When people are laughing, they are going to be more open to new ideas.”

Mental health advocate and founder of The PostSecret Project Frank Warren will speak at AU on Feb. 22, according to a Kennedy Political Union press release. 
Created by Warren in 2004, the PostSecret Project is an effort to collect anonymously mailed cards containing “the soulful secrets we never voice,” according to the release. So far, the project has received over 500,000 postcards, each containing a different confession, ranging from feelings and acts of love and kindness to fear and guilt.
The event, to be held in the MGC University Club at 8:15 p.m., will kick off the start of the project at AU, which will last from Feb. 29 through March 18,  according to the release. The project, put on by Student Government, is meant to raise awareness about mental health issues on campus. Warren will address the crowd and then answer students’ questions. 
“The Kennedy Political Union and Student Government as a whole understand that bringing speakers to campus is an essential part of the process of bringing light to the issues that matter to American University students,” KPU Communications Director Coby Eiss said. “Warren’s work in the field of mental health advocacy will provide great insight to students looking to improve American University’s resources to address this pressing matter.”

Mark Davin cheers for his swimmers during AU's meet against Georgetown in early January. 

	At the crack of dawn, the collegiate swimmer’s alarm clock blares, signaling the call to wake for a grueling morning workout. The swimmer crawls out of bed and trudges to the pool to prepare for a mentally and physically taxing day of training. The swimmer rises before the sun and travels more yards in the pool before breakfast than most people walk in a day. The regimen requires immense sacrifice on the part of the athlete, but often overlooked in the pathway to success is the role played by the unwavering support system found in a college program’s head coach.

	Mark Davin, the  head coach of the men and women’s swimming and diving programs for the Eagles, nears the end of this twentieth season this spring, and his swimmers will look to his wisdom and experience as they head into the 2016 Patriot League Championships on Feb. 17. For seniors Ali Follman, Giorgio Zenere, Toby McCarroll, Lena Mentyka, Paris Wood and Jakobi Jackson, the upcoming championship represents a challenge, a celebration and the end of their collegiate careers. Follman reflects on the past four years with positive memories, both of swimming and her coach.

	“In high school I didn't think I would swim in college, let alone a D1 program, so Mark really introduced to me a new world of swimming that sounded much more appealing than what I experienced throughout high school at a YMCA program,” Follman said.

	Now, with three and a half seasons under her belt, the School of Communication senior who thought she was not qualified to swim in college has developed into a powerhouse breastroker, and will be an integral part of the Eagles’ medley relays at the Patriot League Championships.

	“Under Mark I learned to be a more competitive swimmer and do it for myself because I deserve to swim fast,” she said.

	Davin, who has coached one Olmpian and ten Olmpic trials qualifiers during his time at AU, came to Washigton, D.C.in 1995  after a successful swimming career at Florida State University.  Davin previously held coaching positions at the University of California-Berkeley, Arizona State University, the Arizona Swim Devils and the Fort Lauderdale Swim Team at the United State Swimming Hall of Fame.

	In his first six seasons, Davin and the Eagles competed as part of the Colonial Athletic Association, and the head coach garnered CAA Coach of the Year honors twice before AU ultimately moved to the Patriot League in 2002. While in CAA, Davin also produced four Rookie of the Year swimmers and six Swimmer of the Year honorees, in addition to coaching the men’s team to a CAA conference victory in 2001. One year later, during Davin’s Patriot League debut, he won Patriot League Men’s Coach of the Year and has since produced at least three NCAA qualifiers.

	While Davin’s coaching accolades speak to his coaching talents on the pool deck, his senior swimmers paint a more personal picture of the veteran coach as they reflect on their collegiate swimming careers, which will come to a close at the end of February.

	Toby McCarroll, a native of Nassau, Bahamas and a former member of the Bahamas National Swim Team, said he will remember Davin as an influential part of more than just his swimming career at AU.

	“In my regular individual meetings, we have spent hours talking about classes and future life goals,” McCarroll said. “He realizes college is a stepping stone to a greater world experience and does his best to provide useful advice and encouragement to help us along our journey.”

	McCarroll, who specializes in the breaststroke events, will graduate in May from the College of Arts and Sciences with honors, and he joins the nearly 200 other athletes coached by Davin who have earned recognition on the Patriot League Honor Roll.  In the fall, McCarroll helped the men’s team earn a place on the Scholar All-America Team for the 42nd consecutive semester, a streak that Davin has kept alive during his tenure at AU. .

	 Lena Mentyka, a sprinter who hails from Seattle, echoed McCarroll’s sentiments about Davin’s personal investment in his swimmer’s lives. She reflected back on the support that Davin gave her early on in her time at AU, saying, “Mark is without a doubt the best coach I've ever had. I've been through lots of ups and downs in my college swimming career: injury, changing events, coaches coming and going. I think we get along really well and he's helped me through a lot swimming wise and in life in general.”

	As the longtime head of the AU swimming and diving program, Davin has built a family on the deck and in the pool over his twenty years coaching in Bender. Paris Wood, the team’s 100-yard backstroke individual record holder and part of the record holding women’s 4x100 yard freestyle relay, said she will remember the team and coach that stood by her for the last four years.




			“Mark has a knack for recruiting like-minded people who are all very similar in personalities, so there's rarely ever conflict, which makes it a really good environment,” Wood said.

			Davin prides himself on bringing in swimmers who embrace his program and work towards improvement through his workouts. Under his coaching, his seniors have dropped significant time and etched their names in the AU record books. After three years with Davin, Wood has broken three school records, won the Geico Student-Athlete of the Week Award multiple times and appeared in the championship finals at the Patriot League Conference Championship. Jakobi Jackson, another senior breastroker, has dropped fifteen seconds in his 200-yard breaststroke from his freshman to senior year. Mentyka completely switched events under Davin’s guidance, moving from the distance group to the sprint program, and she has also found herself on the Eagles ‘A’ relays this season.

			While each of the senior Eagles share different memories of their head coach, they all have one small, yet favorite element of Davin: his sense of humor.

			“[Mark Davin] is always down to tell a punny joke,” Jackson said, “even when they weren’t that funny.”

			Mentyka agrees, adding that Davin brings wit and intelligence to the pool deck and often comes ready with a pun to entertain the team during the early morning practices or the difficult afternoon training sessions.

			Davin’s legacy

			The successes and memories of the 2015-2016 senior class serve as just a snapshot of Davin’s illustrious career at the helm of the AU swimming and diving teams. He coached junior swimmer 
	Caylee Watson to such improvements in the pool that she has recently been named to the U.S. Virgin Islands team roster for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio. Davin also coached Olympian Casey Legler, conference title winners and U.S. Olympic Trials Qualifiers including Dominic Szabo, Mark Liscinsky, Meghan Thiel, Ethan Bassett, Jessica Lidstrom, Rebecca Santos, Frank Byskov, Will Maher and Rebecca Santos. Over the course of his 20-year tenure, Davin has helped his swimmers almost completely rewrite the AU swimming Top-10 times list.

			With all of those accolades, trophies, titles, and plaques, Davin is, at the end of the day, more than just a coach for the athletes who have joined and graduated from his teams. According to his seniors, he is a support system and a pillar of strength for not only for graduates, but for the entire AU swimming and diving program.

			As McCarroll puts it, “time and time again Coach puts his athletes before himself.” His seniors’ words and the successes seen by many in the past twenty years are a testament to the program that Mark Davin has built on and off the pool deck at AU.

*Note: Jess Kowal is a former member of the AU swim team.
