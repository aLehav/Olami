LANY at the 9:30 Club in October 2016.
The first words you hear on LANY’s debut album come after a swell of soft rain and glittering synths. Singer Paul Klein quickly confesses, “Oh my god, I think I’m in love.”
And when you listen to LANY, and their self-titled release, you can’t help but feel the same way.
Three years and four EPs later, the Los Angeles band released “LANY” on June 30, a long awaited album for fans. Their chill, alternative sounds and ability to evoke a simple sense of teenage wonder have caught the attention of many, making them a hot opening act for the likes of Troye Sivan and Ellie Goulding. 
They went on two headlining tours without an album in sight. That is, until March 3, when the rose logo that had been seen so many times on tour accompanied an Instagram caption confirming a June release.
The singles leading up to the release (“Good Girls,” “It Was Love,” “The Breakup,” “13” and “Super Far”) confirmed that the band’s simple west coast vibes and sound were not only going to stay intact, but were also merely small glimpses into a bigger story played out on “LANY.” Each song on the album is its own story of love with all the confusion, beauty, work, sadness and rawness that come with being in a relationship ─ or trying to keep one together.
One of LANY’s greatest strengths is their ability to say the unsaid in their lyrics. What do you say to someone who is your everything, who won’t commit or who keeps running away? How do you process what your friends say about your love or what your mind starts thinking of at 2 a.m.? Most of these thoughts never surface in real life, but LANY has clearly pulled them out of their minds for our viewing. The album exemplifies a process of piecing together those hard to say lines and synthesizing them into songs that pack a heavy punch for the listeners.
Mixed with their brutal honesty is a sense of poetic beauty and diverse content that can’t help but put you in the song. “Overtime” puts you on defense as Klein speaks directly to his betraying lover, saying, “Tell me how you put those tears in your eyes, grand central downstairs, skippin’ work that night.” You get to slip into the shoes of a reflective rockstar on “Tampa” with the airy, late night thoughts of “I can do better than this.” A sweet voicemail from drummer Jake Goss’s mother puts you on the receiving end of the a parent’s chatter, a role that many kids know so well.
Despite the beauty and happiness that LANY thrives on, a lot of blame and reality exists on this album. Klein speaks directly to someone with his frequent use of “you,” a tactic clearly used to communicate his purest, raw thoughts. “I love you” seem to be quickly followed by the “how did we get here?” as seen in songs like “Flowers on the Floor” and “Hericane.” In fact, the songs flip so frequently between the two that you begin to question whether all the electronic synths and Tumblr-esque lyrics are simply rose-colored glasses for its listeners. Are all of these sensations of love and lust just romanticized figments of a glittering alternative album? Are we truly in love with this release or just the way it makes us feel?
But, as Klein sings on the last song: it was love. And we know that.

The four animated members of Gorillaz: 2-D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle and Russel Hobbs.
Damon Albarn’s Grammy Award-winning musical group Gorillaz is embarking on their first U.S. tour in 10 years, stopping at Merriweather Post Pavilion on July 17. Rappers Danny Brown and Vince Staples, who both appear on Gorillaz latest album, “Humanz,” will open the tour, which kicked off in Chicago earlier this month.
The experimental, virtual band had a run of fantastic albums in the 2000s, and was praised for mixing styles from alt-rock to reggae on their three studio albums in the decade. Though “Humanz” received mixed reviews at best, the album did feature some highlights, including “Ascension,” which features Vince Staples, and “Saturnz Bars.”
The band’s flawless second album “Demon Dayz” (2005) proved the group was more than a one-hit wonder, and could produce a moody, concept album with mainstream appeal and plenty of killer pop songs.
Playing those songs on tour will be real-life musicians performing the music for their cartoon alter egos — Murdoc, Noodle, Russel and 2D — live on a screen behind them. Albarn, who fronted the beloved britpop group Blur, does it all on stage, orchestrating the chaos with charisma and an abundance of energy.
Gorillaz puts on a can’t miss live show, even for the casual fan, and the music world is better for having them back on stage.
The group hits the Pavilion on July 17, limited tickets are still available here. Doors open at 6  p.m for the 7:30 p.m. show.

It’s a good thing we have the U-Pass.
 	Metro shook things up for commuters, with fare hikes and schedule changes to trains and several area bus routes starting June 25. Metro also increased the cost of parking at some stations. 
 	Metrorail trips now have a base fare of $2.25, an increase of 10 cents during peak hours and 25 cents in off-peak hours, while the Metrobus base fare is now $2, an increase of 75 cents. During peak hours, Metrorail rides can rise up to $6.
 	Though the fare hikes will have an impact on students in D.C. for the summer, students with U-Pass cards, which will be issued or renewed in the fall, likely won’t notice the change.
 	However, all student riders will notice the change in hours. Trains will leave stations less frequently during rush hour on some rail lines. On the Red line, trains will run every four to eight minutes. They’ll run every eight minutes on all other lines, rather than every six minutes as they had in the past.
 	Meanwhile, several bus routes will also see an increase in late night service, with buses stopping hourly after midnight on the 30S and 30N routes, which run through Tenleytown. The N2, N4, and N6 bus routes also experienced schedule changes, with buses on the N2 and N4 routes stopping every 30-25 minutes and buses on the N6, during its evening hours, stopping every 30-35 minutes.
 	Metrorail’s operating hours have also changed. Monday through Thursday, stations close at 11:30 p.m., and on Sunday, stations close at 11 p.m. Stations will stay open until 1 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.
 	Find more information about all of Metro’s recent adjustments on WMATA’s website.
