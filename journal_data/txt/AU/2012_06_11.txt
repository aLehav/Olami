Editor's note: Eagle Rants editor apologizes for the small font rants. He's not exactly sure why that's happening and will fix the last few weeks as soon as it's figured out.
•Peace to the Gods and the Earths!
•@”you do realize prescriptions have expiration dates?” Please learn some chemistry. Almost all pills have the exact same molecular structure and function for years and years after their due dates. The due dates exist so that you will buy more pills and further medical industrial complex that is big pharma greed.
•Thanks for the early rants!!!
[Editor’s Note: No problem!]
•@”No need to talk to me like we are in a porno” I love it when my bf says “you like that” when we have sex. Nothing turns me on more. I guess everyone has their opinion.
•I agree with the small font ranter. Why so small editor. MAKE RANTS BIGGER. OR ELSE I WILL CONTINUE TO RANT IN ALL CAPS SO I CAN READ MY WN RANTS!!!!
•@”it's physically and biologically impossible to have six wisdom teeth” Actually it’s not. I had 5.  So did my mom. It’s called genetics. Google it.
•@online degree ranter: Aside from for-profit schools, no online degrees do not carry a negative stigma.  It all depends on the school reputation. Great schools with online graduate degree programs include Stanford, Columbia, GW, Boston U, USC, Emory, Duke, Carnegie Mellon, Harvard, SMU, Johns Hopkins, and the major state schools for practically all states (especially University of Florida).  Stay away from for-profit schools. (But if you go to AU, I think you probably already know this haha)
•sell my body to go back to daily eagle rants. I feel so lost and without a sense of community without daily rants. :(
•My goal was to spread education and multicultural tolerance throughout the world. But lately I have been thinking that won’t this only lead to greater depression and fear?  If people are exposed to more religions then they question the truth of their own religion and are left with a never-ending cycle of questions/fear of what happens to us when we die. Like what if we are SIMS characters and after death the programmer tortures us with emotional simulations that lead us to an eternity of anguish?  Does anyone else think of this sh** or am I just that emo?
•My mother causes nothing but misery. How can I stop caring so much about her approval and stop wasting my life constantly disappointed that she doesn’t care about me?
•I’m getting fat, fat, fat.
•@online grad school: I plan on doing an online grad program too after AU because my boyfriend is going to grad school in a random city where the only local university does not have the graduate degree program I want t do, and we don’t want to be apart for years on end while on opposite sides of the country.  I’m interested in Boston University’s online masters in social work. What are you interested in doing your online degree in?
•Trust me, while it isn't super common - it isn't uncommon to have more (or less) then 4 wisdome teeth. You can google it or I can send you a picture of all 6 teeth.
•Don't tell anyone but I love America.
•Dear Eagle Rants Editor,
The past couple of rants have been very difficult to read due to font size. It may be a formatting issue but you should definitely look into it.
•I was too busy last semester to actively search for jobs. I was too busy during finals to do so as well. Now it's been several weeks since I have graduated and have to find a job.
•sorry, but i really don't care about your internship. you can stop instagramming photos of your office that nobody cares about
•@you like that?: I KNOW!
•Okay, whoever ranted the serenity prayer gave me some serious flashbacks to my time in rehab.  Not sure if that's a good or bad thing.  Trust me, kids-- it's not fun!  Don't do it!
•Sexism. Also hilarious
•@Life is strange: People are strange, when you're a stranger, when you're a stranger, when you're alone. ~The Doors
•@moron saying you can't have more than 4 wisdom teeth: actually a very significant percentage of the population has more than 4 wisdom teeth. You know nothing dentistry. Stop trying to be a poser.
•After my high school's crazy homecoming, where a kid punched three people out, and a senior had sex with a freshman under the bleachers, the administration decided that every student going to prom would have to take a  alcohol test (not a Breathalyzer, but similar) before being admitted into the dance. Two kids refused to take it, saying that that would be an unwarranted search. Curious to see what all you debate wonks have to say about this...
•EZEKIEL 25:17
•I want to have sex with my boyfriend, but he never makes any advancements toward me.. it's been two weeks. :( #hopelesslyhorny
•WTF is up with the small font all of a sudden on Eagle Rants?
•I wish you were just honest with me from the beginning. It's not too late to tell the truth.
•Summer Song of the Week for all you romantics: Sixpence None The Richer - Kiss Me
•I really really need to find a job so I can start getting out of the house once in a while. It's becoming a problem.
•Did my rant about explosive diarrhea get censored? Fine. Whatever. Be that way.
•First time checking Eagle Rants all summer and glad to see that the mundane-ness of life outside of DC has driven everyone to the same degree of pathetic madness that I currently find myself wallowing in.
•I need a brain transplant.
•My bf bought me a scale and left it next to my bed. He says he’s just trying to promote being healthy. My BMI is 19 (18 to 25 is healthy, below 18 is underweight). I’m not at all fat. But he is only 5 pounds heavier than me and only eats 1500 calories a day and says that I eat too much sugar because I drink milkshakes (and eat salads, fruit, and water the rest of the day). I’ve gained 8 pounds this year but I think that’s normal for a young woman in her 20s. Am I wrong?
•The sex is terrible, but he's perfect husband material and I do love him. Will it get better?  I feel like I'm being raped and can't wait for it to be over every time. But I enjoy his company, and wouldn't want him out of my life. What do I do?
•You were in my dream last night.
•I call my balls the Cradle of Life.
•@"I miss my french roommate. :("
I miss painting you like one of my French girls.
