After “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” flopped with both fans and critics, many die-hard DC fans and occasional superhero movie-goers were left wondering whether “Suicide Squad” could fix the disappointing mess that Zack Snyder left behind. After seeing the movie for myself, I can answer that question with a confident “eh.”
This film is the long-awaited third entry in the DC Cinematic Universe, starring Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis and many other notable actors. At its best, it offers a unique premise that could foreshadow the next installment and show off some lesser known DC characters. With its gritty aesthetic and jam-packed ensemble of accomplished actors, “Suicide Squad” sounds interesting in theory.
The government, which is rightfully concerned about a meta-human invasion, needs a team of people with the capability to stop them. Who better suited than a team of supervillains who are locked up in prison and have no other option but cooperation? 
However, the movie’s characters are grossly underdeveloped to the point where an audience will only feel sheer apathy towards the plot and well-being of the characters. There is nothing in the film that truly convinces the audience that anything happening actually has consequences, even when the villain is literally trying to destroy the world.
The first 45 minutes of the film are easily the best because they at least met expectations. You get to meet the characters and see what they can do. There’s a lot of action, a lot of banter and a good eaamount of exposition, which is easily digestible and properly informative.
But once it gets through the required introductions, the movie starts to get messy.  Going into “Suicide Squad”, I expected the film to follow a similar formula as “Avengers,” where the impending danger is built upon your empathy and devotion to the characters all coming out on the other side. You can tell the film is failing when the reaction to a main character dying during a fight is apathetic.
This movie becomes one very long scene with a few flashbacks sprinkled around to help establish Harley Quinn and The Joker. The format didn’t allow for me to really care about the characters or the resolution at all by the end of the movie, which read as “Justice League is coming, so just forget about these guys” -- which is exactly what Bruce Wayne says to Amanda Waller in the mid-credits scene.
One aspect a lot of fans will complain about is that Jared Leto’s Joker was not featured enough in the movie, apparently because his scenes were cut down substantially after reshoots. I have the opposite perspective  -- the lack of Leto was a good thing. In Leto’s portrayal, the Joker isn’t a character, it’s just an archetype.
In “The Dark Knight” from 2008, one of my favorite parts of the movie is Heath Ledger’s Joker, who had more than one conflicting backstory and a clear motivation. This all developed the idea that the Joker was a mysterious figure that lived only for chaos. Leto’s Joker has no backstory and no motivation, and there was no point putting him in this movie at all.
The strongest character in the movie is Amanda Waller, who is a fan favorite. It was important that she was well-written. In the comics, Waller is known for being clever and cunning and manipulative and is what you would picture if someone described the devil to you. To its credit, “Suicide Squad” depicts this perfectly.
Perhaps most detrimental to the film is its general air of apathy toward every aspect of the plotlines. The characters weren’t very interesting, the story was pretty standard and the script was not exceptionally written. On top of all of this, the film gives us no reason to care about the characters and their journeys at all. And despite the villain being fairly strong, you figure out early on that it’s a “Pandora’s Box” situation, and you wouldn’t feel bad for Viola Davis’ Waller for opening the box because you know she’s smarter than this.
The film is definitely better than “Batman v. Superman,” but if that’s the bar you have to set to determine whether the movie is any good, then you are not setting it particularly high. While the movie has strong moments and some slightly redeeming qualities, its execution is misguided, even with the extensive reshoots. If you’re a die hard comic fan or want redemption from “Batman v. Superman,” then you should check this movie out. But if you want to see a legitimately well-produced and well-written superhero movie, you’re better off going back to Marvel.

I recently watched Jimmy Fallon joke about lifting a ceremonial giant mosquito net covering all of Rio during the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games. He said, “the Olympics will be simultaneously broadcast on NBC and WebMD.” Quite a bit of speculation has been raised about the safety of hosting the Games in Rio due to the Zika virus, which has rocked Brazil since early 2015. Are these fears well based in research? 
The answer is not an easy one to explain -- while the Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization say the Zika virus poses little risk to Olympic visitors this month, other public health experts have said otherwise. 
In a piece featured in the Harvard Public Health Review this May by public health scholar Amir Attaran, he argued that the Games should be moved because not enough is known about the most recent strain of Zika (the disease was first discovered in Uganda in 1947).  He insists that the lack of knowledge, and the subsequent lack of an effective vaccine, puts travelers at risk of infection.
Here are the facts: the Olympics will surely attract thousands upon thousands of people from every corner of the globe to Rio, overcrowding the city in a bacteria breeding ground. Considering the high levels of Zika infection in Brazil, it makes sense that people all over the world have questioned the safety of Rio. But the presence of Zika in the area is not the only factor at play. 
While Zika can be transmitted sexually, its main method of infection is by the mosquito bite of the species Aedus Agypti. Brazil tends to be cool and dry in August, as it is in the midst of its winter. These conditions are not ideal for mosquitos who thrive in moist environments, meaning that it is unlikely that they will be a significant presence at the Games. The city has also been heavily treated with insecticide, further protecting it from mosquitos. Additionally, Rio happens to be hundreds of miles from the epicenter of the Zika outbreak in northeastern Brazil.
Is this enough reassurance to claim the Games are truly low-risk for Zika infection? Scientists have compared the 2014 Rio World Cup to the upcoming Games. During the Cup, Brazil was heavily affected by the Dengue virus. The Dengue virus, a mosquito-borne tropical disease, had reached epidemic levels similar to those of the Zika virus this year. 
However, of the hundreds of thousands of tourists who travelled to Brazil for the World Cup, only three Dengue infections occurred and all were far from Rio in a city called Belo Horizonte. Dengue, like Zika, is most commonly transmitted by mosquito bite. The weather conditions of the Cup and the Games are nearly identical, being only a month apart.  Because of the similarities in these viruses, a Cambridge University study used the frequency of Dengue cases in Rio tourists to estimate the risk of Zika transmission at the Games, and projected that as little as 15 new Zika cases could result from the Games. 
To their credit, the WHO and CDC still advised pregnant women to skip the Games due to the devastating effects the Zika virus can have on babies. To ensure absolute preparedness, U.S. athletes have been informed of effective mosquito bite prevention and been provided long sleeve shirts and pants. They will also be given a six-month supply of condoms to continue using after leaving Brazil. 
Five D.C. area athletes are competing in the Games this summer. Olympic gold medalist swimmer Katie Ledecky, swimmer Kate Ziegler, fencer Katharine Holmes, runner Matthew Centrowitz and boxer Gary Antuanne Russel are all in Rio preparing for or competing in their respective events. Ledecky expressed her confidence in traveling to the Games alongside teammate Michael Phelps, who said, “We’re not worried about it.” 
Although a giant mosquito net will not be present at the Games this month, Olympic athletes and spectators alike are safe in Rio and can keep their focus on the gold.

AU alum Sarah McBride speaks at the Democratic National Convention on July 28. 
This year’s Democratic National Convention was significant in more ways than one. Just hours before Hillary Clinton became the first woman to accept a major party’s nomination for president, AU alum Sarah McBride carved out her own place in history, becoming the first openly transgender person to speak at a national political convention on July 28. 
McBride’s journey to the convention stage included a term as SG president from 2011-2012. She credits her transition from Tim to Sarah, which she publicly announced in an Eagle op-ed at the end of her presidency, as the beginning of her life as her “authentic self.” Just over four years later, the Democratic LGBT Caucus honored the 25-year-old with a national platform to share her story -- an experience she called a “whirlwind.” 
“I was mostly nervous about making sure that I did the transgender community proud, that I did right by them,” McBride told the Eagle on the Monday following her speech. “Obviously, no one trans person is a reflection of an entire community, but I did hope that I represented them well.”
McBride said she aimed to accomplish two goals with her speech: humanize the transgender community and educate the public on “what it’s like to be transgender.” With just one week to prepare, McBride placed her personal story within the broader context of the election, urging viewers to support Clinton’s candidacy for president. 
“I wanted to make sure I underscored the humanity of this issue,” McBride said. “I think so often transgender people feel unseen and are treated as though they are unworthy and unvalued.”
McBride began her political career in Delaware. She worked on Gov. Jack Markell’s bid for governor and the late Beau Biden’s two campaigns for attorney general. At the time, she believed that her passion for politics and her gender identity were “mutually exclusive.” This made life as her “authentic self” incompatible with her dreams, something that quickly changed after she came out. 
“I think people so often think, ‘oh, well, no one wants to hear from me and my story’ or ‘my voice isn’t important,’’” McBride said on coming out at AU. “But it is, and it really can make a difference.”  
She later became the first transgender person to intern at the White House and graduated from the School of Public Affairs in 2013 with a degree in political science. The most emotional moment of her speech, however, wasn’t about her transition, her political career or her internship. It was McBride’s reflection on her marriage to Andrew Cray, a transgender man, in 2014. He died of a terminal illness five days after their wedding. Her Huffington Post essay chronicles her relationship with Cray -- one that she said fuels her advocacy for transgender equality.
“For me, his death really underscored the urgency of this fight,” McBride said. “There’s a whole host of unfinished work for trans people and for LGBTQ people.”
At the age of 25, her passion for politics and her gender identity has merged seamlessly into a nationally recognized persona. She told The Eagle that the media attention hasn’t stopped since the start of the convention -- something she’d never imagined possible just four years ago when she came out at AU.
“I think it has been a testament to how things have changed and the goodness of people that the response of those in the arena and from the audience at home has been overwhelmingly positive,” McBride said.  
McBride recently became the National Press Secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy group in D.C. She’s working toward electing Hillary Clinton in November and believes that all universities, like AU, must implement non-discrimination protections to shield transgender students from prejudice.
“We need to push those [schools] forward so that no student fears discrimination or harassment or bullying simply because of who they are,” McBride said.
