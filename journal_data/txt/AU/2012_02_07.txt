Campus Grotto ranked AU as the second most expensive college in the United States with a “net price” of $36,271. 
Campus Grotto, a national college news publication, determined the net prices of various colleges by subtracting the average need-based grant from the total cost of attendance for the 2011-2012 school year, according to its website.
Drexel University came first with a net price of $40, 491.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Enrollment Sharon Alston said these rankings are misleading since the data did not factor in merit awards and other institutional funding from the university.
“The reality is that AU meets the demonstrated need of its students,” Alston said.
Approximately 80 percent of last year’s entering class received financial support from AU. 
“This academic year alone, $69 million of the University’s budget has gone toward undergraduate financial aid, and financial aid expenditures are third behind personnel (faculty and staff) and supplies in the overall budget, an indication of the University’s commitment towards the students,” Alston said.
In October, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine ranked AU as the 47th best value for a private university.
Applicants must navigate all of these college ranking sites and determine for themselves if AU will provide the best value for their tuition dollars, Alston said. 
“Students and their families need to evaluate the variety of material that they read online and compare this to the information they receive from the institution itself to determine whether the university is the right fit,” Alston said.

Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler is surprised Maryland hasn’t moved to legalize same-sex marriage sooner. 
A state senate committee is expected to vote on a Gov. Martin O’Malley’s same-sex marriage bill in the next few weeks.
“Ten years ago, people would think, ‘there's no way in the world,’ ‘it's like walking around on Mars,’ ‘there's no way same-sex couples are getting married in this country,’” Gansler said at a speaking event Jan. 31 in MGC 3, sponsored by AU College Democrats. “Ten years from now, they are going to look back at it as if it was some sort of quaint debate: ‘You know that was weird. Remember when they didn't let same-sex couples get married?’"
Gansler also called the issue a “Republican” one, saying that he believes Republicans see homosexuality as choice and “believe that they can be changed to no longer be homosexual.”
“There’s no issue — it seems to me right now — that’s a social issue that’s more Republican,” Gansler said.
Lawmakers also remain undecided on whether the state should recognize same-sex marriages from other states.
"There's five states in the middle where we say marriage is between a man and a woman, so we don't allow same-sex marriages in the great state of Maryland,” Gansler said in his speech. “But we will, and we are silent on what we are going to do about these other marriages [same-sex marriages from other states].”
Gansler testified in favor of same-sex marriage at a Maryland senatorial hearing Jan. 31, a move Gansler considered risky.
"I knew if I talked to my political people — as you see everyone is over-coached these days — they'd say that was a really stupid idea politically,” Gansler said. “But I thought it was the right thing to do, and I get paid less than paralegals that work at big law firms, so I thought, ‘you know, what if I'm going to be doing this job, I might as well do what's right.’" 
The State Senate legalized same-sex marriage in February 2011 but it failed in the State House that March. Gansler hopes both chambers will pass the bill this year.
Gansler was elected attorney general in 2006 and is in his second term. He is also the president-elect of the National Association of Attorney Generals, the assembly of all the attorney generals in the United States.
Gansler teaches as an adjunct professor in AU’s Washington College of Law, where he teaches Criminal Trial Advocacy. 
He supports the unionization of AU adjunct professors, saying it gives adjunct professors an opportunity for competitive pay. 
“If in fact it passes, the next issue is: What will the union do for the adjunct professors?” Gansler said.
He encourages students to vote whenever they can, but also to take their time in college to pick a side of the political spectrum.
“I don't think people should pick a party based on what their parents are, but they should understand the issues and figure out which party is more aligned with their views,” Gansler said. “And then get involved the party."

After watching “Chronicle,” you’ll understand the downside of super powers. 
Co-writers Josh Trank (who also directed it) and Max Landis make their feature-film debut with “Chronicle,” which documents the lives of three high school seniors who develop amazing powers after they make a mysterious discovery. Though the new powers come as a blessing, the boys soon have to battle with their dark sides. 
“Chronicle” is a true roller coaster ride; its story and first person “handy-cam” style brings you along on an action-packed ride that peaks almost sporadically.
The audience follows the action through the camera bought by Andrew (Dane DeHaan, HBO’s “In Treatment”), an angst-y teen with a troubled home life who seems to only buy the camera to piss off his drunk father and “film everything” in his life. 
Andrew, his cousin Matt (Alex Russell, “Wasted on the Young”) and high school superstar Steven (Michael B. Jordan, “Parenthood”) are bonded forever when they find a mysterious crater in the woods during a high school rave and Andrew is persuaded to film it.
Though the movie starts a bit awkwardly, it quickly picks up momentum as action and fame envelop the boys’ lives and their powers mature.
As the film continues, it keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering when the inevitable “worse” will happen. 
The film’s mixture of comedy and suspense ties together well in the end, but the highs and lows can feel a bit uneasy at the time. 
Surprisingly, the origin of the boys’ powers is never really explored, while the relationships, amusement and madness that their powers create become the focus of the film. 
“Chronicle” is edited similarly to the “found footage” style made famous by “The Blair Witch Project (1999), the “Paranormal Activity” trilogy (2007) and “Cloverfield” (2008). 
However, unlike “Cloverfield,” the shots are filmed well and don’t induce motion sickness. “Chronicle” is also unique because the story seems to be taking place in the present with no indication that the footage is ever “found.” In fact, the camera seems to take on a role of its own to bring insight into the characters as the film bounces around between cameras taping the event.
The setting is used in the film to convey a sense of proximity and danger. Beginning in an unknown small town in the mountains, which, just like the boys, seems separated and harmless, “Chronicle” gradually moves closer to civilization as the boys’ abilities become more powerful and danger rises. 
The motif of philosophy and power also remains a key piece throughout the film, which foreshadows the climax scene in the end.
“Chronicle” is a stunning supernatural thriller that lacks a back-story in a good way. The often disappointing exploration of the origin story is thrown aside to make way for the imagination, giving the audience enough to talk about on the ride home.
