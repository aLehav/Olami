Map highlighting original affected areas of the water advisory created by D.C. Water and Sewer Authority.
The D.C. Water and Sewer Authority advised D.C. residents to boil their tap water for drinking and cooking as a precaution in certain D.C. areas, including AU’s main campus and other university offices, Vincent Harkins, Assistant Vice President of Facilities Management for AU, said in an email memo Friday.
At 11:45 a.m. the advisory was lifted from AU’s main campus and university offices, Harkins announced. The advisory still remains in place in Northwest and Northeast D.C., where many AU students live. D.C. residents can check if their home is still under advisory using this interactive map created by D.C. Water and Sewer Authority.
The water in the affected areas is safe to shower and bathe with, but cannot be swallowed. All water being consumed in affected areas must be boiled, including for pets.
As a precaution, don’t rely on a filter or water from any appliance connected to your water lines. Customers should use cooled, boiled water or bottled water for:-Drinking-Brushing teeth-Preparing and cooking food-Making ice-Preparing infant formula-Water for pets
