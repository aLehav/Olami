•What do you think my brain is made for? Is it just a container for the mind?
•"Look away I don't want you and your rude self staring at my booty anyhow."
wearing something that makes other people uncomfortable and then demanding that *they* make sure *you* don't pass in their line of sight is rather selfish. 
•This bathroom smells like a sewer #SISproblems

•"•I don't understand why you're still lying to me, but I don't care anymore."
That's sad. Try to care. Apathy is the worst thing that a person can feel in this world, worse than hate and worse than grief because there is no way to channel apathy. Don't mistake emotional exhaustion for not caring. Take a time out if you need to but don't leave the game.
•Guy with snoring roommate here: @HasEarplugs, thanks. But doesn't that interfere with actually getting up in the mornings?
•@Person Who Prefers Tests Be Done On "A Mice" Than Humans: Me too but I think you meant either "a mouse" or "mice".
•@I wonder if he still thinks about me: He's a guy. Of course he does. If he ever told you he loved you or you told him that, yes he still thinks about you. Now stop ranting and if you think about him (clearly you do since you wrote this rant), go talk to him.
•@Wants a lurid afffair with a professor: No you don't trust me. Someone ranted about bad coffee breath and tacks in the butt. It's all true. Plus either bad teeth or worse wrinkles.

•"A Feminazi is a hard core feminist," First of all, use the right "there" next time you'd like people to take you seriously. Second of all, any "feminist" who hates men is not a feminist--they're a female-supremacist. A feminist is fighting for equality for women, not complete supremacy. We hate the patriarchal society and those who support it. Not men. Men are great. Happy Women's Day everybody, and don't forget that not all women have vaginas.
•Good looks to the Crown Prince of India for smelling up A6S on the daily. 
•"A Feminazi is a hard core feminist, whose harshness and brutishness is equal to that of a Nazi." hmm that's funny I didn't know men were the group being systematically raped, tortured, and abused because of their gender OH WAAAAAAAAAAAAAITTTTTTTT but f**k you though.

And then he friendzoned me.
•There's this guy on my floor that is, legitimately, the most annoying, anime Asian obsessed guy I've ever met.  And the worst part is: he wears these stupid pajama pants with money on them and calls them his "money pants". 
•Shoutout to the sexy bearded guy on anderson 3! You should come out of your room more often! ;)
•3 rants published! Yes! I dread the day my kids says "My father was very funny." Because that means I'm dead.
