Late night taco stand Surfside is set to open a new location in Tenleytown by April 2019, according to Eater.
Restaurateur Bo Blair started the popular beach-themed chain in 2008, and has since expanded from the original location in Glover Park to a 24-hour taco stand in Dupont Circle. The menu includes tacos, burritos, bowls and more with an array of proteins, including steak, pork, shrimp, mahi mahi and vegetarian options.
According to Eater, Blair said the Tenleytown restaurant, to be located at 4200 Wisconsin Ave NW, will be open 24 hours to meet the needs of students in the area. The space was formerly home to the Fire Lake Grill, which closed in 2014, and is part of an AU-owned building that also contains the Greenberg Theater. 
The restaurant will join local favorite Osman & Joe’s Steak ‘n Egg Kitchen and McDonald’s as some of the few late-night options in Tenleytown. The news comes as Burger Tap & Shake, another late-night favorite, shut down its Tenley location on June 4.
