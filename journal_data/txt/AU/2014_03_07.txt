U.S. Conservatory and Botanic Gardens
Though smaller in comparison to other Botanical Gardens, D.C.’s own is a hidden gem, often overshadowed by the Smithsonian. Like the Smithsonian, the Botanic Gardens and Conservatory are free, but they are a nice change from the go-to tourist stops. 
Day Trips
If the weather is nice enough and you have access to a car (or a ZipCar), why not spend the day away from D.C.? 
1. Baltimore 
Baltimore is about an hour’s drive from D.C., and it is also possible to get there using mass transportation. Spend the day shopping at the Inner Harbor, and be sure to check out the famous National Aquarium. 
2. Shenandoah National Park 
Located in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, this destination is perfect for hiking, fishing and camping. 
3. Colonial Williamsburg
History buffs will love this town frozen in time. Colonial Williamsburg is considered America’s largest American History Museum, as most of it has been preserved to resemble how it looked during the American Revolution. 
4. New York
Catch an early bus and spend the day in New York City. Fares are as low as $30 roundtrip. If you’ve never been, spend the day as a tourist and visit places like Rockefeller Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Central Park.

On an overcrowded public bus in India, a man on the work commute gets felt up by a smiley, wrinkly stranger; no one notices. Across town, another man stares up at a ceiling fan, waiting to die.
Director Ritesh Batra lifts a magnifying glass to modern-day Mumbai—a city bursting at the seams—to examine these most microscopic stories of human interaction. “I think we forget things if we have no one to tell them to,” one character muses. Often, these stories and connections in “The Lunchbox” are fascinating and unexpected.
The story begins with a happy accident, giving life to one of the film’s favorite lines: “Sometimes the wrong train can lead you to the right station.”
One day, the dabbawala (a lunch delivery service) mistakenly drops middle-class widower Saajan Fernandez (Irrfan Khan) a lunchbox from a young woman named Ila (Nimrat Kaur). The box was meant to go to her husband. Noticing the mistake, she pens a note to Fernandez, and tucks it into the lunchbox for delivery. Despite the original mistake, Saajan and Ila allow the mismatched deliveries to continue, communicating back and forth via lunchbox letter. In time, they develop an unconventional but rewarding friendship.
Andante-paced, sprinkled with humor, The Lunchbox is a collective of snapshot stories on what it means to connect with another human being. The mundane humdrum of modern life in Mumbai is captured gorgeously in cultural context. The tantalizing possibility of future change is portrayed with lingering, sometimes indulgent shots of Saajan and Ila lost deep in thought.
While impressive for what it accomplishes in just over 100 minutes, The Lunchbox comes off as almost a dream-like teaser clip, hesitating to commit itself to any kind of concrete conclusion or resolution. Much is left unanswered. The film takes its time, exploring human action and reaction, and is enjoyable in what it accomplishes, but does so at the expense of a fuller, richer ending.
At its core, “The Lunchbox” is very human, with each character searching for acknowledgment and love in society. The film is enjoyable as a diluted, but elegant cultural drama on micro-level human relationships and self-discovery.

One very specific rule going in: don’t look in the bag.
This is what Robert De Niro (“American Hustle”) explains to John Cusack (“1408”) at the beginning of David Grovic’s debut feature “The Bag Man.” Using a steak as a prop for his scoundrel tendencies, Dragna (De Niro) explains that he needs a package delivered to a motel located in the middle of nowhere. Jack (Cusack) must wait for Dragna to pick up the bag and then he can be on his merry way.
Grovic’s “The Bag Man” suffers predominantly from a misplaced sense of humor and a generally problematic form of sexual violence on screen that is tantalizing. Jack eventually meets Rivka (Rebecca Da Costa), who bears the brunt of the thrashing from crooked police officers, gangsters and pimps, although Da Costa still manages to be the most dynamic of the cast.
De Niro has quite an enjoyable time performing with a larger than life pompadour and spouting quotes from Sun Tzu and Herman Hesse. But even this doesn’t manage to reclaim “The Bag Man” from fairly lukewarm depths of portentousness. 
With a New York epilogue that barely answers questions and several action sequences that leave as much of an adrenaline rush as “It’s A Small World,” the film begets a misplaced sense of its own importance and cleverness. As well as filching much of its haughty nod-nod, wink-wink sort of humor from Quentin Tarantino; hoping this is enough to hold a viewer’s attention.
“The Bag Man” as a film borrows much from Tarantino and the plot device, a bag with mysterious contents, is straight out of “Pulp Fiction.” “Kiss Me Deadly,” which provided inspiration for “Pulp Fiction,” also had the same idea of a bag whose contents remain a mystery throughout the film.
But by claiming this sort of hegemony on Tarantino spiced dialogue and plot devices, the film itself becomes just another knock-off of Tarantino films. So add “The Bag Man” to the shelf alongside “Go” and “Love and a .45.” “The Bag Man” lugs around too much latent baggage of a problematic nature to bother with it more than a cursory viewing. Though by the time the film ends there’s really no reason to care at all.

Alain Guiraudie’s “Stranger by the Lake” is a highly charged erotic thriller where unassuming relationships grow deadly. 
Franck (Pierre Deladonchamps, “Night Squad”) becomes a frequent visitor of a lake meant as a cruising stop for flings, as a cynical and sexually overactive middle aged man who is enamored by another frequent visitor of the spot, Michel (Christophe Paou, “The Affair of the Necklace”). Michel, a mustachioed and slightly menacing individual, soon becomes somewhat irresistible to Franck.
Eventually, Franck witnesses Michel brazenly murdering his lover in the lake. However, Franck doesn’t run nor does he call the police, but instead remains in the forest until nightfall when he makes his escape.
Events proceed with an unsettling nature of graphic realism as Franck and Michel begin to have heated relations with each other in the forest by the lake. Soon, these relations turn sour as Franck quickly realizes that Michel is far more dangerous. 
Guiraudie’s film galvanized much of its entertainment around the shock value of the intimate nature around these many scenes depicting male erotisism. They display an almost ironic gumption of beefed up masculinity. Moreover, Guiraudie’s “Stranger by the Lake” revels in counterpoint by intercutting long quiet contemplative shots of unrushed nature, relying on no musical score and placing emphasis on the sounds of nature to puncture silent moments.
Relations remain quite distant even though Franck and Michel continue to get caught up in fairly passionate and graphic moments of intercourse. Sometimes implying felicitous infidelity and profligate disappointment in each other when matters don’t pertain to sex. 
“Stranger by the Lake” is a strange film that makes sex an almost dredging, but necessary effort. Guiraudie’s ability to apply tension never quite works, but this is a minor flaw in an otherwise cold and compellingly drawn portrait of sexual degradation and how it can cross gender lines with ease. The film expresses a peculiar detached realism that’s hard to swallow, and like most truths of that nature they are most often the hardest to forget.

Danielle Green’s column explores the stories behind AU students’ tattoos. Read her introductory column for her thoughts on tattoos in general.
After just a semester in D.C., Becky Rodriguez got her first tattoo. A serotonin molecule now rests on her ribcage as a personal reminder to live happily. 
“Do what makes you happy, always,” Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, transferred to AU during the second semester of her freshman year.  She had always wanted to come to D.C. but originally decided to stay close to home and attend University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. 
The decision to transfer from UNC was not an easy one, because it came with the finality to settling into a major, she said. She was placed on the second floor of Hughes Hall where her floor mates helped her easily adjust to her new school. 
Rodriguez said she sometimes wonders if she made the right choice, but resolves that she feels happier being at AU and in the city.
Getting a tattoo had been a longtime wish and once she arrived at AU, no longer under the watch of her “strict parents,” she went for it. The serotonin molecule plays on two aspects of her world, one being chemistry and the other being the pursuit of happiness.
Rodriguez’s decision to get the tattoo was based on the notion that “no matter where you go, remember to be happy.”
“Tattoos are like cheating life because of their permanence in a world where the only constant is change,” Rodriguez said.
