The 4330 48th St NW lot in the AU Park neighborhood behind the law school campus has been empty since late 2013 when the Fresh & Green’s grocery store closed. Developers are proposing to fill that void with a mixed-use redevelopment that would bring a grocery chain and other retail to the site as well as 200 to 250 residential units over five stories.
First and foremost, the Editorial Board supports the effort to build a new grocery store in the vacant space. Many students live in the surrounding area, and even more will likely live there as the student population increases per the Campus Plan in the years to come. The nearest grocery store for students living in Spring Valley right now is the Tenleytown Whole Foods, which is over a mile away and challenging to access without a motor vehicle. Not to mention, the Safeway on 42nd Street NW will be closing soon for a redevelopment project by the adjacent Georgetown Day School.
A Harris Teeter, one grocery chain the developers are talking to, or a comparable store there would make it more convenient for those students to shop for food.
The proposed residential units are controversial with some members of the community. One woman described the development ominously as “creeping urbanism” at a community meeting on Oct. 28. Another attendee proposed the entire development be exclusively townhouses.
We do not find this line of criticism credible and believe the housing development would improve the neighborhood. Though the developers have not yet decided what type of housing units to build, the community would be better served by units that are apartments instead of condominiums.
D.C. is facing a housing affordability crisis that is only getting worse as more people move to the District. Increasing supply of housing units by building more is the best way to combat this problem. While one development won’t solve a comprehensive issue, the proposed project is the type of step that will help at the margins. Ten percent of the units will be set aside for affordable housing, per D.C. law, which will help lower and middle-class individuals.
The revenue from the housing units will also help to fund other parts of the project, according to the comments of Will Lansing of Valor Development at the Oct. 28 meeting. To the extent that residential units are needed to make the grocery store viable, we think opposition from some in the community should not be an obstacle.
We urge the Tenleytown Advisory Neighborhood Commission to support this project at its Nov. 12 public meeting.

	The future of Adams Morgan may look a little greener with new park spaces and sustainability programs and have a stronger sense of community and culture, under new recommendations from the D.C. Office of Planning.

	The office released a 32-page “Adams Morgan Vision Framework” plan outlining 17 long-term goals for the neighborhood, including increasing cultural diversification, embracing the neighborhood’s history and strengthening local retail. Plans for developing new community spaces and adding sustainability programs are two of the most emphasized aspects of the proposal.

	One proposal includes revamping Unity Park along Columbia Road to make it more of a destination for members of the neighborhood.

	“Once a place for vibrant, episodic commerce, the park’s utility is waning and its design stagnating relative to the liveliness of the corridor,” the plan says. In the future, the park could include more trees, seating and shaded spaces, and may even serve as a space for farmer’s markets, artistic events and concerts.

	The plan also proposes adding a new park to the neighborhood at the corner of 18th Street and Columbia Road. The area currently has about 5,000 square feet of unused concrete space, according to the plan, that could be transformed into a more usable community green space.

	Goals regarding a long-term sustainability plan for the neighborhood include creating a “sustainability task force,” implementing a new composting program and reaching a target of 25 percent of high-performing, solar paneled rooftops.

	The plan praises the neighborhood’s current walkability, multiculturalism and emphasis on locality, but also seeks to enhance each of these facets to promote Adams Morgan’s artistic and cultural history.

	“The vision framework tells a narrative of the neighborhood by unpacking its important cultural and historical aspects and building on them to ensure Adams Morgan retains relevancy and competitiveness in the context of a growing city,” the plan says.

Oftentimes in activism, particularly (but by no means exclusively) student activism, people like to describe themselves as student leaders. They adopt positions of responsibility and visibility and can come to represent a movement in the eyes of the student body, the administration and the members of the movement itself.
Their “leadership” hurts their movement, sometimes irrevocably.
I’ve been at AU for nearly four years now, and I’ve been involved in student activism and organizing movements for most of that time. In that time, I’ve seen the emergence of “student leaders,” a term I’d previously only heard in the proverbial halls of Student Government. The concept has quickly taken root in student activism groups, with many of these new student leaders being direct transplants from SG. I believe this to be detrimental to student movements in several ways, on top of making them boring.
People who identify themselves as student leaders, I have observed, are frequently motivated by personal gain. Some students leaders seek their positions so they can put it on their resume or talk about it in interviews for campaign positions. For these people, leadership is a stepping stone. This is not to say that student leaders don’t care about the causes they’re a part of. They’re just willing to use the cause to further their own careers.
When people become “student leaders” on campus, their words gain power. A movement that previously valued the input and perspective of all of its members becomes hierarchical when a leader takes over, and the words of the leader matter more than those of the members. Suddenly,  members of the movement simply defer to the leader when it comes time to make decisions. Those outside the movement, like the public and media, also defer to the leaders to make statements to represent the movement. Leaders are often politically more centrist than members are, so their unofficial power actively waters the movement down.
By representing the movement, these leaders create vulnerabilities for the movement. University administration seeks to placate and appropriate them to bring the movement into its own fold rather than allow the movement to demand change. Movements threaten large institutions, and enveloping a movement within an institution neutralizes the threat. Similarly, organizations or institutions which could have eventually come to be the target of the movement seek to recruit the leaders, to prevent the movement from becoming a threat later.
Many times, leaders don’t even realize what they are doing to the movement. They don’t recognize that the administration wants the time and assistance of the movement so that it is working for the administration, rather than against it. Internally, they are so used to getting their way that they don’t realize they’re changing the movement based on nothing but their own opinions.
In this, the leaders make their movement vulnerable to being co-opted, and they slow it down. Large-scale actions, like marches, are put on hold so that student leaders can meet with the administration. Variety of tactics disappears, replaced with the favorites of the leaders. The movement takes same approach to every issues, one mode of thought about how to pursue change becomes an unquestioned norm, and the movement becomes a matter of procedure. Ascendant leaders can undo months of organizing work by jumping the gun, because they’ve decided that they’re a leader and that they don’t like the way a movement is headed.
Leadership issues apply regardless of the scope of the movement, whether or not it is student-based. Arguably the most successful workers’ movements in history, the Russian Revolution, transformed from a triumphant revolution into a despotic police state after a small group of intellectuals who appointed themselves as the vanguard of the people rose to power.
Gloria Steinem, one of the biggest names in the women’s liberation movement, worked with the CIA to further the goals of the CIA internationally; namely, American dominance.
DeRay Mckesson, a prominent figure in the Black Lives Matter Movement, pushes education privatization as being on par with the Free Breakfast for Children Program of the Black Panther Party. He also (purely coincidentally, I’m sure) received a $10,000 award from the massive Teach For America organization, his employer before, during, and after Black Lives Matter emerged.
It’s difficult to see how TFA, an organization that sends (overwhelmingly white) inexperienced non-teachers into already struggling school districts, taking public funds while displacing local teachers and enabling salary slashing and union-busting for the remaining teachers, is at all comparable to the Black Panther Party providing free lunch to hungry kids in their community.
If real grassroots change is to occur, movements cannot allow themselves to fall under the sway of opportunists. Even if those leaders truly believe that they have the best interests of the movement at heart, and that their leadership will help the movement, they are wrong. They believe themselves more capable than the combined power of the rest of their movement. They seek to build their own power on the backs of their comrades, rather than building power for the class of people that they belong to.
If we want to win, if we want to build a better world, we must step up and do it ourselves. No one knows enough to guide us there, and the world they guide us to may not be the one we set out for in the first place.

	Boundary of the ANC 3E, which encompasses parts of AU Park, Friendship Heights and Tenleytown (Office of the ANCs).
At tonight’s monthly Tenleytown Advisory Neighborhood Commission meeting, residents (that includes you, students) have a chance to weigh in on a half dozen issues that could bring changes to Tenleytown and the neighborhoods surrounding AU. 
The meeting will start at 7:30 p.m. and will be held at 4300 Military Road NW in the Embassy Suites Hotel, Chevy Chase Ballroom I. Here’s a look at some of what’s on the agenda (in descending order of likely controversy/importance): 

Presentation by Valor Development regarding proposed mixed-use development at the Superfresh site, 4330 48th St. NW:
District Wire reported last week on developers’ plans to build a mixed-use development at a former grocery store spot behind the current Washington College of Law building. Here’s the brief: Residents like getting a grocery store back. But they’re unenthused about the project team’s proposal to build 200-250 residential units on top of the planned grocery store, totalling five stories, in the low rise neighborhood. Read the full story here.

Update by Georgetown Day School on plans for their expanded Tenley campus. Possible ANC vote on a letter to Georgetown Day “regarding proposed mix of housing units, including size and number of affordable units”:
The Tenleytown private school Georgetown Day plans to expand its campus footprint at 4200 Davenport Street NW by demolishing the adjacent Safeway and bringing its Palisades lower school over to the site. The second part of the school’s plan is more controversial: to build two eight-to-nine story residential buildings at the site of the former Martens car lot on 49th Street and Wisconsin Avenue. Opponents say the buildings are too tall. Supporters argue the area needs more density. None of the ANC members take issue with the height, but they have lingering issues over parking and traffic.

Discussion and possible vote on resolution regarding proposed bike lanes on 44th Street, NW, between Jennifer and Harrison Streets and 39th Street, NW, between Van Ness and Albemarle Streets:
Bike lanes are usually controversial, particularly in Ward 3, with many old timers clashing with smart growth urbanist-types who welcome cycling. District Wire will be surprised if there isn’t lengthy discussion. 

Presentation of and possible vote on grant request to support Tenley Winterfest 2015:
Tenley Winterfest is the annual festival featuring craft and food, live music, film screenings, restaurant specials, and other events. This year it will be held Nov. 27 – Dec. 5. 

Discussion and possible vote on resolution supporting a D.C. Department of Transportation proposal to add Capital Bikeshare stations at Jenifer Street NW and Massachusetts and 48th Street NW.

College is when your mind gets blown. Right? 
Last year, author William Deresiewicz published a book, Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life, which questioned whether the elite model of higher education—specifically the model the HYPsters (Harvard, Yale, and Princeton) practice—still blows students’ minds. A model where most students get A’s, where everyone is expected to be busy, busy, busy all the time, and an elite college is a step on the path you’ve been on since age three. 
I challenge anyone who attends one of these universities to read his book and not wonder if he’s right. 
Dwight Garner at The New York Times sums the author’s argument up, explaining that Deresiewicz, as a Yale professor, worries “we’ve spawned a generation of polite, striving, praise-addicted, grade-grubbing nonentities—a legion of, as his title puts is, ‘Excellent Sheep.’”
Deresiewicz himself describes the problem as being that “the kids who manage to get into elite colleges have, by definition, never experienced anything but success.” 
I remember the horrifying college application process all too well, and he’s right about one aspect of it. If you screwed around at all in high school, you can kiss those Ivies goodbye.  In order to get into any of the schools in the top 25 U.S. News ranking, you cannot have anything less than a top GPA and amazing SATs, not to mention the extracurricular activities and whatever unique, life-altering experience you wrote about in your college essay. Getting into the top 50 isn’t that much easier. 
It takes a certain personality type to manage such an accomplishment. 
One of the reasons AU appealed to me is because the school did not seem to be courting those perfect students. I was not a perfect student. And in the same way you don’t want to date someone who doesn’t want to date you, I didn’t want to go to a college that didn’t want me. I was excited that the AU admissions counselor told me that AU valued work experience in the application, that I could apply test optional and that it would be okay that I didn’t try very hard in school when I was 15. 
In fact, I was excited to be going to a school that was good, but was not necessarily elite. I was excited to have classes full of both Type A and Type B students. I was excited to be going to a school full of wonks, and not just a school full of future consultants and investment bankers. 
But AU has been climbing in the rankings every year I’ve been here. 
On the one hand, that’s a great thing. The value of my degree keeps increasing. It’s more and more prestigious to be able to shake hands with someone at a cocktail party and say, “oh, yes, I went to American” every year. In theory, that increased value means that AU can increase tuition and add to the endowment every year because we’re all getting more for what we pay. And, in theory, AU can use that extra tuition to give future students a better education through more resources, more interesting classes, more tenured professors. 
But on the other hand….it feels like AU is raising my tuition every year just to stay competitive with schools like GW. And GW is doing it to stay competitive with with Georgetown. Who is doing it to compete with the HYPsters. 
GW’s president even admitted it in a Washington Post article, where journalist Kevin Carey characterized the GW president’s philosophy as being that “College is like vodka,.....Vodka is by definition a flavorless beverage. It all tastes the same. But people will spend $30 for a bottle of Absolut because of the brand. A Timex watch costs $20, a Rolex $10,000. They both tell the same time.”
AU President Neil Kerwin hasn’t said the same. But I can’t help but suspect he feels the same way. 
AU is using my ever-increasing tuition to build our brand. They are expanding the campus, building fancy new dorms like Cassell and Nebraska Halls. The school has increased our administrative personnel every year I’ve been here and our admittance rate is declining as we tell more students “no.” 
We’re getting more selective. 
It’s just a feeling. It’s hard to prove. But as I enter my last semester as an AU student, AU’s increasing eliteness hangs over campus. As AU goes up in rankings, it feels like the University is starting to value students who can make the grade over students who can make some noise. It feels like AU is beginning to value working at consulting firms and investment banks over working for nonprofit organizations. Peace Corps ads decorate shuttle buses across campus, but nearly twice as many students line up to hear from the World Bank at involvement fairs. 
The higher in the rankings AU climbs, the more of an elite school we will become. And I’m worried that the more elite we become, the less we will value toppling the system that put elites there in the first place. 
When I was a senior in high school, my mom was at a party, and she told someone I would be attending AU in the fall. 
“Oh!” said the woman. “Well, if you want to be part of the political system, you attend GW. If you want to change the system, you attend American.” 
My mom, for her part, didn’t quite know how to reply. 
But I was so proud when my mom told me the story. I remember thinking how excited I was to go to a school with the movers, the shakers, all the wonks who wanted to change things. And now I’m worried that AU is privileging the U.S. News Rankings over keeping that reputation. That we’d rather be full of excellent sheep than a group of students who like to make some noise.

*Updated: 5:09 p.m. Nov. 14. Corrections and clarification appended. 
The discovery of posters bearing Islamophobic messages on campus Sunday evening has raised concerns about the safety of Muslim students.
The posters mentioned chapters of the Muslim Students Association and Students for Justice in Palestine. One depicts deceased al-Qaeda member Anwar al-Awlaki with a target over his face. The picture on the poster is surrounded by the words, “MSA Terrorist: Head of al-Qaeda in Yemen, President MSA Colorado State” and the hashtag “#StopTheJihadOnCampus.” A 2010 New York Times article confirms that al-Awlaki attended Colorado State, and was the president of the MSA chapter there.
Another poster, which bears the same hashtag, shows a bloody knife hovering over a Jewish star under the words, “The real meaning of BDS: Boycott, Divest, Stab.” This phrase draws a reference to “Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions,” a strategy used by Students for Justice in Palestine chapters and other organizations to protest Israel’s political treatment of the Palestinian territories. 
Students found two posters in the tunnel next to Bender Arena and four more on lampposts between Kogod and Katzen.
Aman Abdelhamid, the president of AU’s MSA chapter, said she felt severely troubled by the posters. 
“We’ve been dealing with [Islamophobia] our entire lives, but to come to a school and to have fliers posted like that with threatening images…it’s just so upsetting,” Abdelhamid said.
The posters are linked to “Stop the Jihad on Campus,” a campaign funded by the California-based David Horowitz Freedom Center. A statement that the Office of Campus life e-mailed to the student body Tuesday afternoon connected the posters to the Freedom Center, and the group’s website claims the organization “combats the efforts of the radical left and its Islamist allies to destroy American values and disarm this country as it attempts to defend itself in a time of terror.” 
Horowitz’s materials have appeared on campuses across the country, according to Abdelhamid.
Members of the MSA and SJP found a 44-page manifesto on the website for the “Stop the Jihad on Campus” campaign. The document claims that MSA recruits for al-Qaeda and Hamas. None of this is true, according to Laith Shakir, treasurer of AU’s SJP chapter. Both organizations’ budgets are financed through AU Club Council, he said.
“Not only is all of the information presented here categorically false, it also propagates an exhausted talking point: if you are (or even just look) Muslim, and you're involved in campus organization, you must also be involved in a terrorist group,” Shakir wrote in a Facebook post Sunday night. “Thus, Muslims and people who ‘look Arab’ are inextricably linked to violent extremism. The promoted hashtag isn't trying to just ‘stop the jihad’ (which, itself, is a nonsensical phrase); instead, it's trying to eradicate anyone who could conceivably be labeled as Arab or Muslim from organizing on campus.”
Shakir was one of several students who shared pictures of the flyer on Facebook. Many urged their peers to report the incident to Public Safety. Some also offered to walk with Muslim students who did not feel safe traveling alone, Mokuena said. 
The posters have made Muslim students feel unsafe, according to Abdelhamid.
“I had people calling me [on Sunday], telling me that they were legitimately scared,” she said. “The posters…had really strong implications, really threatening messages.”
The discovery of the posters coincided with instances of Islamophobia on other campuses in the DMV area, Abdelhamid said. The same posters were recently spotted on the Georgetown and George Washington University campuses. At Virginia Tech, students found the message, “On 11/11, we will kill all the Muslims,” written on a bathroom stall, Abdelhamid said. 
The fact that the posters originated from an outside organization, Abdelhamid said, will not be comforting until the people who put them up are identified. 
“The thing is, we don’t know who posted these flyers,” she said. “It was definitely on behalf of that organization, but we don’t know if they sent people from the organization to come on campuses, or whether they recruited actual students.”
On Sunday night, SJP president Ntebo Mokuena brought one of the posters found in the tunnel to the Public Safety office, where she filed a written report. An officer escorted her to the tunnel to take down the other poster there and walked with her to MGC to look for more. She said she was told that officers would be available to escort any students across campus, and that they would search the campus for more posters.
Members of the MSA and SJP raised concerns about the posters in a meeting with representatives from the Kay Spiritual Life Center, Public Safety, Student Activities and the Office of Campus Life Monday afternoon. 
Although officers assured Mokuena and others Sunday night that they would find and remove as many posters as they could, Attai said she saw three posters on lampposts near Kogod, and one on the traffic box near Glover Gate, on Monday morning. Three Public Safety officers were standing near the one on the traffic box, she said, so she assumed it would be taken down. When she passed by the area three hours later, the officers were gone, and the poster was still there. She and a friend took it down themselves, despite fears of being targeted by the people who put them up. Attai said she removed the three on the lampposts as well.
AU Director of Public Relations Kelly Alexander said in an email that the officers did not remove the poster on the traffic box because it was “crazy glued” down, and the traffic box was city property. To avoid damaging the box, Alexander said, the officers requested that the city take the poster down.
Alexander said that a Public Safety officer removed additional posters on the quad near Kogod.
She said that between Sunday and Monday, any poster that Public Safety officers saw or were made aware of were taken down. Posters left up either went unreported or were put up after officers patrolled the area.
Public Safety did not issue an independent public statement or AU alert, despite requests from MSA and SJP members. The University did release a statement on Facebook and Twitter shortly after the posters were discovered.
"AU Public Safety has been doing a really good job reaching out to us and being proactive in terms of dealing with this whole issue. The head of PS has now met with us for the second time to ensure and work with us that our safety and well-being is secure," Attai said.
However, both SJP and MSA members said they were concerned by the University’s lack of protocol for dealing with hate speech.
“The University had good intentions, but they said a lot of what is going to be done is going to happen through the community,” Abdelhamid said. “And I understand that … community involvement and awareness is a huge part of the whole situation, but the administration needs to do their part. We need to know that the University knows how to deal with these kinds of threats.”
Shakir said he was also troubled by the University’s response.
“As students and members of a marginalized community, we didn’t know where to go after being specifically targeted with violent messages,” he said. “Part of our hope is that this will serve as a case study for the University going forward, to have a protocol in place to allow students to know how the University will respond to hate crimes before that happens, and to serve as a sort of preventative measure.”
Gail Hanson, the vice president of Campus Life, said AU does not have a hate speech policy. There is a set of Freedom of Expression Guidelines, which she said outlines the cases in which the University can intervene in student speech. 
“Protest or demonstration shall not be discouraged so long as neither force nor the threat of force is used, and so long as the orderly processes of the University are not deliberately obstructed,” the policy states. 
Prohibited “expressions of dissent” include those that “deny or infringe upon the rights of other students, faculty, staff, or guests of the University community…disrupt or interfere with educational or other activities of the University community…[or] endanger the safety of any person on the University campus.”
The guidelines do not apply to people from outside the AU community, Hanson said. In accordance with University policy, only students, staff and faculty are allowed to place posters on campus. The organizations or individuals responsible for the content must make their names visible on all posted materials. Posters put up by outsiders will be removed, Hanson said. 
Shakir said the posters are “emblematic of a much larger mentality” of animosity toward SJP chapters and Islamophobia.
This is not the first time AU’s SJP chapter has encountered hostility, according to Mokuena. She said that the group’s posters are frequently defaced or ripped down.
The MSA, SJP, the University and AU Hillel have issued statements condemning the posters. 
“I am profoundly upset and displeased at the inflammatory posters that went up over the weekend,” University Chaplain Joe Eldridge said in an interview. “It is incumbent on us as an American University community to surround our Muslim brothers and sisters with compassion.”
ebloomberg@theeagleonline.com
Correction: An earlier version of this article misattributed the New York Times article and stated that Anwar al-Awlaki was not president of an MSA chapter. He was, at Colorado State.
An earlier version of this article also misstated the number of posters Attai saw near Kogod.
Clarification: This article has been updated with additional information about Public Safety and the University's responses to the posters. It previously said that Pubic Safety did not release a statement, which they did not do independently around the time the posters were found. Campus police were referred to in some statements made by the University shortly after.
