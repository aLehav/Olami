Water bottles being handed out at the Hatching Leonard Hall in response to the water main break across Northwest DC
The University advised all members of the AU community to boil drinking and cooking water after a water main break in northern Virginia on Friday morning resulted in loss of water pressure across part of Northwest D.C., including AU’s campus. 
Affected areas of the University include main campus, Washington College of Law, Spring Valley and “all other AU offices,” the University said in an email to students. The Washington Post reported that D.C. officials say the boiling-water advisory is expected to remain in place until at least Sunday. 
Early Friday morning, D.C.’s Water and Sewer Authority reported a serious water main break in Arlington, Virginia, causing much of Northwest D.C. to experience low water pressure. An interactive map shows the affected areas. Students living off-campus should refer to the map in order to determine if they are affected.

The drop in pressure briefly affected the University. Just after 6 a.m., David Osborne, Director of Energy and Engineering Energy Management, sent an email to the AU community reporting that the University’s water pressure had returned to normal. 
In the email, University Security and Safety Services said they were issuing an advisory “out of an abundance of caution” and advised the AU community to follow D.C. Water’s directions, which recommended people in all areas affected by the pressure drop to immediately begin boiling their water. According to D.C. Water, although there was no certainty that the water was contaminated when they issued the boil notice, the advisory was made as a precaution while they test the water. D.C. Water has also released an FAQ related to the water boil advisory.
“We encourage all members of the AU community in the affected areas to follow the precautionary guidance offered and boil water used to drink, brush your teeth or prepare meals,” the University statement read. “When boiling, bring water to a rolling boil for one minute, then allow to cool. Avoid using drinking fountains.”
All University dining options will follow D.C. Water guidelines, the statement added. Bottled water will be provided on campus at the Perch in Centennial Hall, the Hatch in Leonard Hall, the Nebraska Front Desk and the Federal Lobby on Friday from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. and on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

A small-format Target opened on Thursday in Tenleytown across from the Tenleytown-AU Metro stop, after a ribbon-cutting ceremony took place Wednesday night. 
Located at 4500 Wisconsin Ave., the Target will feature all merchandise that is at a traditional Target, but with a lower quantity and assortment. In addition to products like apparel, accessories, home decor, groceries, beauty and health products, the small-format Target will feature a CVS Pharmacy and Order Pickup. 
The planning of product selection for the Target kept AU students in mind, store director Hillary D’Angelo said. 
“Small-formats are a way for Target to break into markets we usually don’t get in to, so dense, urban markets and also college campuses,” D’Angelo said. “There’s a need for the household commodities, for the clothes, the one-stop-shop that Target provides.”
Customers will be able to ship online purchases to the store, as well as use the myCheckout device in stores to ship unavailable products. 
“Even if we don’t have it in our store because we do have a lower inventory and assortment, if it’s available and in stock online, we can ship it right to your house and we waive the shipping cost,” D’Angelo said. 
The small-format Target currently employs around 80 team members. According to D’Angelo, employment opportunities are available for AU students and applications can be found online. 
At the moment, Target will not be accepting EagleBucks. However, this could change as a final decision has not yet been made by Target Headquarters. 
Even before its opening, the Tenleytown Target contributed to the community. They were a sponsor of Tenleytown’s Art All Night and have also paired to support community organizations such as Iona Senior Services, adoption agency Kidsave and Thrive DC, an organization that works to end homelessness. 
“Target and volunteering go hand-in-hand, so we just wanted to be very vocal,” D’Angelo said. “We really wanted to make sure we were doing what is needed to be done on that front.”

I have a lot of questions, predominantly about carbon neutrality and sustainability at American University. While I undoubtedly see environmental progress being made and forefronted at the University, I also see stagnation and even regression in other areas. 
Last year, President Sylvia Burwell announced that the school had achieved its goal of carbon neutrality two years ahead of schedule. This was a huge milestone for the University, as it became the first in the United States to have achieved this. Our Office of Sustainability also tracks sustainability progress in areas like dining, waste and transportation. We have a number of LEED-certified buildings, and a main goal of construction is to increase efficiency. 
At the same time, the University continues to be invested in fossil fuels. According to Fossil Free American University, a campus activist organization dedicated to promoting fossil free divestment, the University has nearly $19 million invested in the fossil fuel industry — the industry that’s largely responsible for carbon pollution. Certain professors require us to print lengthy readings and papers on a regular basis rather than just use technology. Campus construction, which feels endless at this point, has undoubtedly created extra pollution. I can’t help but wonder how the construction has impacted the arboretum and other wildlife. 
Even if we are carbon neutral in every sense of the word, it’s not the be-all and end-all of campus sustainability. It doesn’t absolve us of other actions that are having an environmental impact. How can a school that claims to be so environmentally-focused continue to support an industry that is decidedly not? Investing in fossil fuels runs counter to AU’s entire mission of sustainability, because fossil fuels are a source of the problems that AU is trying to combat. 
I understand that divesting is likely a difficult process, and I can’t pretend to have a deep understanding of the University’s financial decision-making. I don’t know why we are invested in fossil fuels, but I know that those fossil fuels are responsible for things like melting ice caps, global warming and ocean acidification. I know that they are a driver behind the increasing number of climate refugees. If the University truly wants to embody environmental sustainability, it needs to divest from this industry. 
Additionally, I doubt that construction has had a positive impact on campus wildlife. American loves to mention the fact that our campus is a certified arboretum, but it seems that no steps are being taken to ensure its protection during construction. I also wonder if anything is being done to offset the impact of construction pollution on the environment. The noise and debris caused by the amount of projects across all of campus certainly impacts the environment around campus in some way. 
Essentially, the University should celebrate its successes while simultaneously acknowledging and working to fix its faults. It can’t solely focus on the good things it has accomplished, not when there are problems that its students are actively working to highlight. 
Being one of the first American colleges to be carbon neutral is a big deal; I don’t want to diminish that. The Office of Sustainability also seems to be doing important work and research, but while it looks good, it’s important that the University recognizes its other actions are also having an environmental impact as well. It’s not enough just to look good by posting carbon neutrality signs on the buses. We need to do good, too.

AU’s men’s soccer team beat Army West Point 2-0 on Saturday during their last home game of the season. This was the first home win for the Eagles this season, making it the first home win for first-year coach Zach Samol. Goals from junior Nick Dimitrijevic and senior Fabio Massaro, as well as a strong team effort, brought forth this victory.
The Eagles scored both of their goals in the second half, following a quiet first. Dimitrijevic scored the first goal while on a breakaway run, and Massaro soon after scored the second off of a penalty kick.
“They are a very aggressive, pressing team,” said Samol. “So we were talking about how to play through the pressure, what spots to take advantage of and how to bypass their front four or five guys. I think we did a really good job with that.”
AU played an aggressive game, registering 10 shots total, even though they have only averaged 6.4 per game for the season. Army did not go down without a fight, as they took eight shots and five corner kicks. Army also played a physical game, racking up 18 fouls, while AU only committed 10. AU’s goalkeeper Jake Agnew made four saves and refused to allow any goals into the goal.
“I think it was the best way to end the season at home, and for us as seniors,” Massaro said.
This win came on Senior Day for the Eagles. Massaro and fellow seniors John Mino, Oliver Price, Tim Neumann, Swezen Kizito, Luke Browning and Matt Gillis were all honored before the game started. Each of their names were called, and they were accompanied to the center of the field by friends and family, where they shook hands with department staff and received personalized framed picture collages with images from their time playing at AU.
“It was something special,” said Massaro. “Where I come from, we don’t have this type of thing. It was a pleasure for me to be a part of this team and this school. [This] is something that I won’t forget for the rest of my life.”
While this win was crucial towards their chances of making the Patriot League playoffs, AU was unable to win their final game of the season against Loyola on Wednesday, preventing them from clinching a playoff berth. AU finished the season with a record of 3-11-2.

Louis The Child, composed of the Chicago-based DJs Robby Hauldren and Freddy Kennett, has taken the world by storm in recent years with its electric music. Serving a creative blend of EDM and its future bass subgenre, the pair puts on exciting shows that have sold out many venues. 
The Anthem, large enough to hold up to 6,000 beat-hungry fans, will be an ideal venue for the dance music duo and their openers, Sebastian Paul and Léon. The venue’s location right on the District Wharf sets the scene for a perfect, picturesque night.
Louis The Child began their music journey as two graduates from New Trier High School who met at a Madeon concert through mutual friends. In 2013, they sold out their Thanksgiving show at the Aragon Ballroom in their hometown of Winnetka, Illinois, where their careers took off. They have sold hundreds of records and performed at large-scale events such as Summer Fest, Lollapalooza and Spring Awakening. The duo has made a name for themselves on social media with over 200,000 followers on Instagram and over 88,000 on Twitter. The duo boasts plenty of fist-pumping hits, but some of their fan favorites are “Better Not,” “It’s Strange” and “Weekend” featuring Icona Pop. 
As for their openers, Swedish-born yet Colorado-based artist Sebastian Paul is an inspiring up-and-coming artist. His newest EP “Trojan Horse” serves up five self-written and self-produced EDM songs in an electric style similar to Louis The Child’s music. Some of his most popular works include “Trojan Horse,” which is featured on his newest EP, “Lust Drunk” and “On Some High.” 
Léon is another Swedish artist with an emphasis in indie pop. With hip-swaying, upbeat music that differs  from that of Louis The Child and Sebastian Paul, Léon provides soul-soothing melodies between EDM acts. Some of her most famous works include “Come Home To Me,” “You and I” and “Surround Me.”
With all of this in mind, Louis The Child’s concert at The Anthem is sure to be an unforgettable experience. 
Louis The Child’s music is available on Spotify and iTunes. Tickets for Louis The Child featuring Léon and Sebastian Paul at The Anthem on Nov. 8 are available here. Doors open at 6:30 p.m.
