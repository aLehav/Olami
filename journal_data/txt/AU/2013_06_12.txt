As I read and re-read the news, I am increasingly worried about my future job prospects. 
In April, the Associated Press reported that 53 percent of recent college graduates are either jobless or employed in positions that do not require a college degree.  
The vast majority of AU students complete an internship (or multiple internships) before graduation as a way of gaining a competitive advantage in the job market.
AU's Career Center consistently ranks among the top-20 best university career services as measured by the Princeton Review. 
Although the prestige of the Career Center initially drew me to AU, I have become increasingly troubled by the University's emphasis on internships, paid or otherwise. 
As I search the Career Center's online listings at this moment, less than half of the internships explicitly offer some type of pay. 
Not only are unpaid internships largely illegal, they also contribute to economic inequality by favoring wealthy students who can afford to pay for housing, food and transportation expenses. A New York federal judge happens to agree.
(The Department of Labor has a test to determine if an unpaid internship is legal

Though not at all groundbreaking, Shawn Levy's ("Real Steel") "The Internship" is an underdog comedy more relatable than most, given the premise of a frightening job market and the cutthroat competition for college grads.
When two 40-somethings, Billy (Vince Vaughn, "The Watch") and Nick (Owen Wilson, "Midnight in Paris") lose their sales jobs at a company that has gone out of business, they find themselves jobless and relatively skilless. 
After both of their efforts to find work fail, Billy and Nick apply to, and land, internships at Google.
Upon their arrival in Silicon Valley, the two friends are predictably placed on the intern team of misfits and rejects: Team Lyle. 
And, like in any underdog comedy, Team Lyle is pitted against a team of aggressively over-achieving jerks.
The portrayal of Billy and Nick as less-than-tech-savvy adults is completely over the top, but that's what this movie is: It's an over-the-top, good-natured comedy. 
Despite some excessive scenes, such as when Billy and Nick lead the interns to a strip club and end up in a wild bar fight, the humor is good for an easy laugh. 
Another scene showcased Google employees (B.J. Novak, "The Office" and Karen Ceesay, "Trouble With the Curve") interviewing Billy and Nick for the internship position, resulting in some of the movie's funniest moments. 
However, a downside of the humor in "The Internship" surfaces in the same interview scene: Some of the jokes are initially quite funny, but they go on too long and losing the humor.
Both the protagonists and antagonists of "The Internship" are nerds. But the screenplay, which was also written by Vaughn (with Jared Stern, "The Watch"), does not let nerds get boring. 
Sure, the characters are still all one-dimensional. But in the screenplay, Vaughn and Stern manage to deconstruct and embellish many different facets of the nerd stereotype: the Cosplay nerd, the socially awkward nerd, the nerd that never gets off his electronic device, the nerd with overly demanding parents and a few others.
In "The Internship," Google is more than a setting

Violet (Alexis Bledel,"Post Grad") and Daisy (Saoirse Ronan, "Hanna") are two average teenage girls living in New York City, except for the fact that they are professional assassins. 
Everything is peachy keen until the besties realize that they do not have enough cash to splurge on brand new dresses designed by their favorite celebrity, Barbie Sunday.
So what's a girl to do in a situation like this? Take the "easy" gig that her manipulative boss conveniently offers them, of course. 
As a result, what starts out as a typical job develops into something more when their target hits them where it hurts the most
