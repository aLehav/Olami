• Mind your own business, certain people
• Sooo, why were the Thursday night Eagle Rants to weird? Seriously, they made no sense to me.
• @"Wow, Biden was a real jackass in the debate tonight.." Well, Republicans should be seriously embarrassed at how disrespectful, condescending, and immature the majority of your presidents are. In words of Michael Kelso, "BURN." 
• Patience is a Virtue. SO CALM YOURSELVES. Rants will be up when they are up. 
• @person who will transfer due to lack of friends: You should check out the Methodist-Protestant Community. Our services are lots of fun and the pastor is pretty badass, and there's always free food (Oreos, Goldfish, hummus, big honkin block of cheddar cheese, the works) after services. Consider this my personal invitation to you to join us 7pm on Sunday at Kay (and it really, REALLY doesn't matter I you're Protestant, Christian, or even religious, you're welcome anyways). If it weren't for the Methodists, I'd have transferred a long time ago. 
• Ummm was it just me, or were you flirting with me all evening?
• YES to Biden calling Ryan out on his BS. Dems need more of that. Of course Republicans are going to whine about his interruptions, ironically, considering last week's debate. 
• Study lounge door handle currently broken. Been stuck in here for 4 hours. Everyone is sleeping or went home for the break. Someone please save me.
• When you connect to your friend in an unnatural and weird way is when you know you love each other.
• eagle rants are a rude wake up call to me. they just highlight how racist and sexist everyone at AU is. stay classy y'all.
• @"I wish the girls at AU weren’t so God-awfully hideous."
In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is kind.
• Can't tell if there was actually blood all over Ward or someone is just the funniest eagle rants troll in a longggggg time.
• Why was there blood on ward's steps? Was it because of scissor man?
• My boyfriend is the most amazing, hilarious man to walk the earth....until a sporting event comes on, when he gets so aggressively angry that i get scared. I already avoid being around him if I know some big game is going to be on. But since there is practically always something sports related on, sometimes Im there. Worst is when we're in the car and he listens over the radio, and becomes such an aggressive drivr that I genuinely think we won't survive. What should I do? I'm afraid this is how an abusive relationship begins
• I hope Miranda July knows she has a great looking ass.
• I want to tell my roommate I am in recovery for an eating disorder in order to get her to stop saying triggering things ("ha ha! I haven't eaten all day isn't that funny? I'm not even hungry!") But it might just make things worse. I don't want to set her off. After all, I used to say things like that before I snapped and decided being a robot running on fumes was better than being human.
• @Im not happy here, and there is no one here i can really talk to about it. I would give anything for a relaxing weekend at home. I FEEL THE SAME WAY! Why can't we know each other?!
• I have trouble making friends here too and i don't why
• Ryan's complete lack of foreign policy knowledge made me want to scream. 
• I hope everyone realizes that the Eagle Rants editor is a normal person with a life. And every time the current one gets 'fired' because they don't post rants on time, the person who replaces them does exactly the same thing. Just be happy with what we've got.
• now that you bring it up, i actually wouldn't mind marrying you...
• Hmmm. The library AND the arena are named Bender? #WhoIsThisBenderAndWhatIsHeOrSheHiding?
• i love that we have our own greeting now. you're adorable.
• We have pocket watches... they're called cell phones.  (Really though, whenever I check the time on my phone I consciously pretend it's a modern-day pocket watch.)
• @Uhhhh since when can’t we smoke in the Mudbox - Since you can't smoke INSIDE a building!
• To the veteran who's having trouble with his/her benefits: I know some people who can help you with that.  Meet me in Ward 101 at 11:30am this Sunday if you want.
• @Democrats should be embarrassed: Nah, man, I love Joe Biden. He's hilarious and right on the money.
• Loving this new GOP "disrespectful" line. Give me a break. 
• My slam went home for break and I'm stuck here.
• Was there really a self-inflicted scissor accident at Ward or did someone just bring joy back to Rants?  Either way, I laughed, thanks.
• @TDR Coffee Ice Cream Ranter: At least you have some selection of ice cream to consume daily. People who do not have dietary restrictions eat up the pints of rice ice cream just because they can, and then people like me have to wait for ages for another opportunity to have some. It's really a downer.
• Thank you so much for reminding me Downton Abbey airs in the UK before the US. Project Free Tv here I come... Guess I know what I'm doing with my Fall Break.
• Hmmmm. Fall "break" is only one day. Anybody else think there's something bigger going on here? #PutTheFactsTogether
• Really wish my professor would stop getting a boner in the middle of class. #CallAMedicalProfessionalBecauseThisMightBeASeriousHealthProblem
• New Rolling Stones song about Zombies and stuff."Doom and Gloom." Pure awesomeness.
• How do I find the lal knockoff????
• pretty girl with the teal bookbag always late for class and running- slow down so i can get to know you...
• Look up Booty Man by Tim Wilson.  You are welcome.
• I'm thinking we need a team lesbian meetup ASAP.
• i hate everyone at this school.
