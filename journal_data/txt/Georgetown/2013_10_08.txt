New smartphone apps such as Hailo, Hopstop and Uberare revolutionizing travel in cities across the nation, causing a shift from personal cars to other methods of travel.
A report released last Tuesday from the U.S. Public Interest Research Group indicated that technology and public transportation innovations in the last 15 years have provided Americans with more attractive alternatives to driving. According to PIRG Senior Policy Analyst PhineasBaxandall, this shift has been largely driven by millennials— especially university students.
“For young professionals and college students, the fact that people are using technology this way isn’t news,”Baxandall said.
As examples, Baxandall pointed to the GPS-tracking availability of many public transportation options, allowing riders to plan trips in a more time-efficient manner. In Washington, D.C., smartphone apps can indicate the location of the next bus, the next Metro train, the location of the nearest Zipcar or how many bicycles are available at the nearest Capital Bikeshare station.
A Washington Post poll this summer found that 89 percent of respondents said they used a car to travel around either nearly all, most or some of the time, in contrast to 94 percent from 2005. In addition, among commuters, 67 percent of respondents said that they usually drove alone to work, a decrease from 70 percent in 2005.
Similarly, the District Department of Transportation has found that 38.5 percent of D.C. households do not own cars. According to the PIRG report, from 2001 to 2009, millennials were 23 percent less likely to drive.
“I wouldn’t need a car if I lived in a city,” Alex Kuhar (COL ’15) said. “With parking, traffic and everything else, it’s just unnecessary. Of course, it depends on the kinds of public transportation available, but a car in a city like D.C. or New York City just doesn’t make any sense nowadays.”
University Information Services Communications Manager Laura Horton agreed and said that the GPS tracking service available for SafeRides vans and Georgetown University Transportation Shuttles has been reflective of this trend.
“There are more phases to come,” Horton said. “That’s something the university really vaules, and the [Capital] Bikeshare program, ZipCar, Uber are part of that commitment as well — we’re trying to give students lots of options.”
UIS Mobile Programs Manager Lee Emmert added that an average of approximately 450 unique visitors use the NextGUTS app each day, which is the most popular feature of the Georgetown mobile app.
As current university policy prohibits students from bringing cars to campus, the administration has been working to improve transportation alternatives for students.
For example, Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey, the Department of Public Safety and private company Ridescout are working together to develop a smartphone app that would combine information about Georgetown transportation and D.C. public transportation.
“You can literally put in where you start your trip and where you end your trip, and it will give you different options on how to get there,” Morey said.
The current Ridescout app, available on iPhone and Android, shows public, private and social methods of transportation, including bus, rail, taxi, Capital Bikeshare, Car2Go and SideCar. In addition, Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Business Services Joelle Wiese said that the university was discussing how to incorporate services such as ZipCar into its broader transportation strategy.
“We see the development and design of these features as a continually iterative process,” Emmertsaid. “So even as we speak right now, we’re continuing to make improvements.”

Only four weeks after Mayor Vincent Gray vetoed a bill that would have hiked the minimum wage for large retailers in D.C. to $12.50 an hour, mayoral candidate and Councilmember Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) has proposed a bill that would raise the minimum wage of all D.C. workers to $10.25.
The Living Wage for All of D.C. plan, if enacted, would make Washington, D.C., the second part of the country, after some municipalities in California, with a minimum wage above $10. Specifically, the bill would raise the minimum wage from its current $8.25 to $10.25 over the next two years, after which it would be tied to changes in the cost of living in the District.
Gray floated the idea of an unspecified minimum-wage hike in the letter accompanying his veto of the Large Retailer Accountability Act, which would have forced large D.C. retailers like Wal-Mart to pay workers at least $12.50 per hour in combined wages and benefits. Nine councilmembers are co-sponsoring Wells’ bill, according to The Washington Post.
Wells and Gray disagreed with the LRAA primarily because it targeted certain businesses while ignoring most D.C. workers.
According to WJLA, 14 notable District businesses have announced their support for Wells’ bills and have committed to raising employee wages, including D.C. Brau Brewing Company, BicycleSpace, Inspire BBQ, The Pug, Union Kitchen, Blind Dog Cafe, Toscana Cafe, Al Tiramisu, Bike Rack, Big Bear, Chocolate City Brewing, Right Proper Brewing, the Law Office of C. Thomas Chartered and 3 Stars Brewing.
“[D.C.] is so far behind every year, and we have to do something about it,” Wells said on Wednesday during a press conference held at D.C. Brau, located at 3178 Bladensburg Road NE.
Wells’ alternative would avoid targeting big businesses and facilitate the transition for employers. The bill would raise the employee tax credit for companies with fewer than 150 employees, and it would also lower the commercial property tax rate from $1.50 to $1.65 on the first $3 million of a property’s value. In addition, to alleviate the burden from the lowest income bracket, Wells’ bill would also increase the standard deduction for personal income taxes.
“We greatly appreciate Councilmember Wells’ introduction of the Living Wage for All Act,” D.C. Jobs Council Executive Director Marina Streznewski said during Wednesday’s press conference. “The bill helps open a broad discussion of a much-needed increase to the minimum wage, while also speaking to the need for District residents, especially at lower income levels, to keep more of the money they earn.”
Ali Plutnicki (MSB ’17), who works at Sprinkles Cupcakes for $10 an hour, said that the bill would help fellow employees better support themselves financially.
“For me, as a student, I think that $10 an hour is fine because I’m still dependent on my parents, but I don’t think it’s something I’d be able to live off of myself,” Plutnicki said.
Councilmember Vincent Orange (D-Ward 5), who is chair of the Business, Consumer and Regulatory Affairs Committee, recently announced that the committee would hold a hearing regarding Wells’ bill on Oct. 28, along with four other bills about minimum wage that have been introduced by other councilmembers.

The D.C. Board of Doctors announced last week only 453 out of 8,000 physicians licensed to work in Washington, D.C., are actively practicing primary care doctors, resulting in a doctor shortage for District patients.
This marks a decrease from 2010, when it was reported that 918 physicians were actively practicing. The survey measured the number of physicians that spent more than 20 hours caring for patients per week.
According to American Association of Medical Colleges Director of Federal Relations Christiane Mitchell, this doctor shortage will be exacerbated by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and its effects on the District’s 42,000 uninsured residents. This will be seen most clearly in Wards 4, 7 and 8, which contain the most uninsured D.C. residents and the fewest practicing physicians.
Executive Director Jacqueline Watson claimed the D.C. Board of Medicine is acutely aware of the problem, particularly because it corresponds with a nation-wide trend.
In 2006, AAMC predicted a shortage of 45,000 primary care physicians by 2020, which it attributed to the aging of the baby boomer generation — a further incentive for many medical students to turn to specialized fields rather than primary care.
“The amount of primary care physicians does concern the board,” Watson said. “We believe that many of the licensees that did not respond to the survey are likely those that live outside of the metropolitan area and just maintain a license here.”
Some of these doctors may work part-time in D.C., Maryland or Virginia, while others become involved in academic or educational applications of medicine or administrative medicine. In addition, Georgetown Assistant Vice President for Student Health James Welsh said that many medical school graduates turn to other fields of medicine rather than primary care because of a perceived lack of prestige and lower earning potential.
“The main reasons that medical students are not choosing careers in primary care are income differentials — on average, a primary care doctor earns on half of that of a specialist — rising medical student debt, medical student training that is largely done in tertiary hospital settings and an inadequate number of training programs for residency,” Welsh said.
To solve this problem on a national scale, AAMC proposed increasing the number of students entering medical school by 30 percent in 2007 — a goal it is on track to meet by 2017. But federal support for medical training has been frozen since 1997, preventing an increase in the number of available residency positions, which students must hold before practicing, according to Welsh.
Several initiatives, however, are attempting to attract medical students to primary care. Mitchell said that the majority of medical schools are now offering incentives to medical students who choose primary care, such as curriculum changes, increased extracurricular opportunities, expanded faculty resources, tuition decreases and increased availability of loans.
For example, the Georgetown University School of Medicine has made an effort to increase medical students’ exposure to primary care specialties and issues through changes in its curriculum and extracurricular offerings. In addition, the School of Medicine has been working to reduce its graduates’ student debt.
“There was not federal support for this, but rather, medical schools felt obligated to do it to meet the needs of the American population,” Mitchell said. “The AAMC has taken steps to solve the problem, and the federal government needs to step up and meet us.”

As the federal government shutdown continues. the School of Continuing Studies is offering classes to all furloughed federal employees, free of charge, beginning today.
“Central to our mission is service to the community, particularly as we establish ourselves as good neighbors in our new downtown location,” Interim Dean of the SCS Walter Rankin wrote in an email. “We saw there was a real need in our local Washington, D.C. community to support those affected by the government shutdown, and we knew that we could react quickly to fill that need. Our students, faculty, staff and I all have family and friends who have been affected by the furlough and want to remain engaged and connected.”
In order to participate in the Georgetown Furloughed Employee Program, which is run through the Center for Continuing and Professional Education, interested participants must provide proof of employment by giving the name of their agency or organization, job title and contact information for an immediate supervisor. The program currently consists of six classes, including “Project Management Fundamentals,” “Manager as Coach,” “Ready, Set, Reset Your Social Strategy,” “Innovation and Leadership in Government,” “Patient Navigation Fundamentals” and “Global Trends in International Migration.” The classes, Rankin said, were chosen because of their relevance to government employees; the most popular class right now is “Innovation and Leadership in Government” with 100 students registered.
“I really think [the class] is testament to the type of knowledge and skills government workers are looking for,” Rankin wrote.
The courses are not for credit, but many are part of longer certificate programs, and interested students could enroll in additional courses within an SCS program to eventually receive an official certificate.
The courses, which are spread out over the next two weeks, generally run from approximately 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and range in length from one to three days. Class sizes vary in enrollment from 20 to 100 students for a total of 240 students; participants can only enroll in one course. Although the SCS originally only offered a total of 100 spots across all six courses, extremely high demand pushed the program to move to bigger classrooms and to open up additional seats. Regardless, there are still hundreds of federal employees currently on the waitlist, and the SCS is working to open additional courses. In the meantime, registration for new participants is closed.
“We are grateful to the community and media for their enthusiastic response to our furloughed employee program,” Rankin wrote. “We have been looking for new ways to engage with the local community, and I think this is a great example of how we were able to do just that. Georgetown’s ethos lines up perfectly with this endeavor, and we are humbled to extend the university’s commitment to the community through this program.”
Although it is possible that the shutdown may end before the last course ends Oct. 18, Rankin said that the SCS will strive to keep all currently scheduled courses open as planned.
“If the shutdown ends earlier, as we all hope will happen, we will understand that many students will not be able to complete these courses,” Rankin wrote. “There will be no academic penalty if a student cannot finish a course.”

This October, Washington, D.C., is celebrating its eighth Islamic Heritage Month.
“It helps Americans as a whole to know that Muslims have been a part of American society since the conception of America,” America’s Islamic Heritage Museum President and Curator Amir Muhammad said. “Throughout America, people acknowledge and celebrate African American and Latino heritage months, and we felt there was a need to celebrate America’s Islamic heritage.”
Islamic Heritage Month, which is held in October because it coincides with the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday, began in 2005 with the opening of the Smithsonian Institution’s America’s Islamic Heritage exhibit, in which the museum displayed letters, copies of the Quran and other Muslim artifacts found in the country.
Eight years later, Amir Muhammad said he hoped the month would continue to raise awareness of the historical contributions of Muslims in America.
“It was a history that was forgotten about,” Muhammad said. “People thought it was something foreign and strange, but we have been involved in American history. We fought in every American war since the Revolutionary War.”
In line with that goal, America’s Islamic Heritage Museum, which is not associated with the Smithsonian, is reaching out to local schools to entice students to learn about Islamic culture and history, as well as to teach tolerance. The museum has also planned a number of events, such as historical documentary viewings and a book signing and discussion with Imam Mikal Saahir, a well-known Muslim author. The museum will hold two plays and a speech, all focusing on Muslim-American relationships in the early days of U.S. history, stretching back to the colonial period.
Amin Gharad (COL ’16), coordinator of Georgetown’s Muslim Interest Living Community, praised the D.C. government’s efforts in promoting diversity.
“A lot of times, we fail to remember that different cultures have come from all over the world to shape America into what it is today, and some of them are Muslim people, whether they came on slave ships many centuries ago or whether they came with changes in immigration law within the past century,”Gharad said. “They’ve had an indelible impact on the ethos of the American community.”
In particular, Muslim Student Association Secretary Sabrina Khan (COL ’16) pointed to the current attitude toward Muslims in the United States.
“I really respect the mayor’s decision to celebrate Islamic heritage in America, especially when there is so much prejudice against the ‘un-American’ Muslim,” Khan said.
Gharad agreed and said that he hoped celebrations such as Islamic Heritage Month would help ease relations in the country.
“Concerted efforts to bring that which is ‘otherized’ into the mainstream and the common consciousness of American people does a lot to reduce tensions on both sides,” Gharad said.

It has been 24 years since the university wrote the Speech and Expression policy that has repeatedly been flagged by watchdog groups and students. Now, GUSA leaders are pushing to make good on a campaign promise to change that.
The university’s policy defines the boundaries of Georgetown’s unrestricted speech zone to Red Square and the Leavey Center lobby, and guarantees recognized groups access to public space on campus to meet and discuss issues.
Georgetown University Student Association President NateTisa (SFS ’14) and Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS’14) made expansion of free speech zones a centerpiece of their February campaign platform.
“There is an inconsistency between having a theoretical campus-wide free speech zone and having a more pragmatic free speech zone of Red Square,” Tisa told The Hoya last week.
The Speech and Expression Committee, which is composed of four undergraduate students appointed by GUSA and four faculty members, met last year only when students or faculty members brought forth complaints of potential policy violations. The committee convened twice in the 2012-2013 academic year. It will have its first meeting of the year on Tuesday.
“Our biggest task would be free speech zones where, instead of having one zone on campus where students can have complete free speech … have campus itself be a free speech zone where certain places are protected,” GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Tane Arana-Humphries (SFS ’15), a student representative on the Speech and Expression Committee, said. “There are certain places given, like the cemetery or President DeGioia’s office, where you should be respectful. But for the rest of the campus, we’re educated adults and should be able to express our opinions.”
This year, in an attempt to change its role on campus, the committee will meet more regularly to review the Speech and Expression Policy instead of convening only to review violations. The committee has the authority to amend the university’s speech policy, along with approval from the vice president for student affairs.
“We’re shifting it from a reactive body to a proactive, meaning it’s not going to react to problems of free speech, but it’s going to go out there and advance it to the community,” Tisa said.
The committee will also work with student groups to gauge their take on free speech.
“Through some of the other work we’re doing, we’re also looking at student organizations and how free speech affects them in terms of student organization standards and access to benefits,” Arana-Humphries said.
According to Arana-Humphries, some sections of the Speech and Expression Policy are vague and open to multiple interpretations.
“A lot of the wording is ambiguous. We need more concrete language on what exactly students can or cannot do, where those boundaries lie,” she said. “We don’t want to have a situation where a certain group has a certain opinion and the administration might have the right to stifle that.”
Foundation for Individual Rights in Education has ranked Georgetown as a “red light” institution for the past seven years for having policies that restrict freedom of speech, but the direct impetus behind the inclusion of free speech on Tisa and Ramadan’s platform was last spring’s Student Activities Fair inO’Donovan Hall, where groups not formally recognized by the university were not allowed to participate.
Without a free speech zone nearby, the unrecognized groups that usually occupy the periphery of the fair in Red Square were not able to table. Instead, the groups, which include unrecognized Greek-life organizations and H*yas for Choice, could only pass out flyers and hold banners.
H*yas for Choice President Laura Narefsky (COL ’14) agreed that there was a lack of tolerance for free speech at Georgetown. According to Narefsky, H*yas for Choice student representatives have reported at least four incidents when envelopes containing contraception pamphlets and condoms were torn from their dormitory doors, which are also a designated free speech zone.
“The general atmosphere is sometimes particularly hostile,” she said. “There is a problem of understanding and accepting that students who have other views exist in our living space.”
Sigma Phi Epsilon member Christian Berger (COL ’16) described his fraternity’s experience at the Student Activities Fair.
“We were pretty upset about it, but at this point, there’s nothing we can do about it because of the university’s stance,” Berger said. “We know where we stand in terms of the university and where they put us, but at the same time, we’re just going to do the best we can to market ourselves to the Georgetown community.”
Tisa stressed that the goal of revamping the Speech and Expression Policy goes beyond expanding freedom of speech for student groups not recognized by the university.
“I don’t want to keep this as an issue for those particular groups, because this really isn’t,” he said. “We don’t have a culture at Georgetown for free speech, and that takes a long time to fix,because it’s also about student culture and the way we interact with each other.”
However, Narefsky said that amending the policy to make it more accommodating to groups not recognized by the university is the first step before changing the free speech culture.
“The current policy puts us under a microscope. We’re constantly watching for ourselves in a way that the vast majority of the student groups don’t need to do so. And that, to a certain extent, does stifle discussion of ideas,” she said
Narefsky said she was glad that the GUSA executives are pushing for the change.
“There was a lot of talk last year. We haven’t seen any implementation of the platform that was discussed. We really hope the GUSA executives will move forward with their promises, and we also want to be involved on the ground floor,” she said. “All voices and opinions at the university should be heard equally.”
Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Jeanne Lord, chair of the Speech and Expression Committee, did not respond to request for comment.

While campus has been consumed lately by discussions of short-term housing solutions, the university has kept an eye on the long term, with the goal of eventually renovating Lauinger Library and Reiss Science Building.
Lauinger Library administrators estimate that fundraising, planning and construction for the library will take approximately 10 years, although there is no definite timeline.
After completing fundraising for the Intercollegiate Athletic Center, the construction of which is set to begin this spring, the university will begin raising $150 million for the library project.
The ideas behind renovation of Lauinger extend back three years, when library administrators began working with Bowie-Gridley Architects to develop preliminary designs that would expand the library while also renovating the existing structure. Bowie-Gridley is also the firm that is designing the IAC.
With the concept of a “Library on the Potomac” in mind, the plans lay out an expansion to the library, which services more than a million users per year, that would extend the south wall of the building to Prospect Street. Keeping the style of cascading Village A apartments, the architects’ design of the south side would include a reading room with two-story glass windows overlooking the Potomac River and an outdoor patio above Prospect Street.
Renovations to the other walls of the library would involve adding windows to the existing structure, including by the atrium and on the front of the tower.
These renovations, however, would preserve the exterior style of the building.
“We are being very respectful of the brutalist conditions of the building because they are part of the history of the campus,” Bowie-Gridley principal architect Paul Lund said. “The way the edition has been composed is that it cues from the underlying geometry of the brutalist building.”
Though Lauinger’s style is no favorite among students, University Librarian Artemis Kirk pointed to its continued relevance on campus.
“There is an aspect of preservation,” Kirk said. “In the library, we are all about preserving and protecting for generations to come, and that does include the building. What can be preserved on the exterior will be and should be.”
Renovations to the interior of the library would add new study spaces, such as the reading room, areas specified for graduate students, cubicles designated for doctoral students and the relocation of Midnight MUG to the fourth floor. In total, these changes are expected to add approximately 1,500 seats to the library.
“The library is a lot more than just books and a lot more than just the physical resources we have here,” said Jennifer Smith, library coordinator of communications, outreach and programming. “We know students use it for a lot of other things, including study space and social space.”
It is unclear at this point what studying accommodations would be made for library patrons during the construction period.
Another project on administrators’ long-term wish list is renovation of Reiss Science Building.
“Reiss has always been in the long-range plans,” university architect Jodie Ernst said, adding that nothing has been solidified yet.
Now that Regents Hall is completed and the Northeast Triangle proposal has made it partway through the neighborhood approval process, the university is taking a closer look at Reiss. At an Old Georgetown Board meeting in July that evaluated Northeast Triangle, university officials discussed the future of Reiss.
“The structure is worth saving; however, all the systems need to be replaced, as does the building envelope. We do expect that it will be reskinned in the future,” Assistant Vice President for Planning and Project Management Regina Bleck said at the time.
“It’s funding-dependent,” Bleck added in an interview with The Hoya last week. “Given the age of the building, all windows would need to be replaced, as well as the central A/C system.”
In sketches, Sasaki Associates, the firm responsible for Georgetown’s master planning, has shown Reiss’ exterior changed to incorporate limestone and carder rock, which are used on both Copley and White-Gravenor halls and used in current designs for Northeast Triangle. The sketches also remove the stairs that are currently at the entrance to Reiss.
Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said that administrators and architects would try to better facilitate academics in a renovated building, potentially by connecting Reiss to Regents Hall through a sky-bridge to create a science corridor.
Initial steps in any renovation of Reiss would be identifying academic programs that would work well in the building, which is currently not used to full capacity.
“We know that Reiss needs a renovation. We need a program to fit that — the building is only roughly half full,” Morey said. “Right now, we have nothing specifically on the books.”
As with Lauinger, no dates have been set for renovation.

Students may get to see former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) back on campus this fall as part of the Georgetown Lecture Fund’s 2013-2014 season.
After a series last year that brought Afghan President Hamid Karzai, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U2 frontman Bono to campus, the Lecture Fund is looking to build on last year’s success.
Lecture Fund Chair Chris Mulrooney (COL ’14) said that in addition to political speakers that the group often brings to campus, members hoping to expand the club’s focus and bring more non-political guests to campus.
While many Lecture Fund events are still in the planning stages, students can look forward to seeing several high-profile speakers in October alone. Former lobbyist Jack Abramoff will speak Wednesday, followed by social policy think tank executive director Shireen Zaman on Oct. 16, and Politico Chief White House Correspondent Mike Allen and New York Times Chief National Correspondent Mark Leibovich on Oct. 22.
Though many of these guests are bound to draw big crowds, many students are eager to learn when former President Bill Clinton will return to campus for the second part of his lecture series. In April, Clinton kicked off his four-part lecture series about his vision for the United States.
“While the Lecture Fund hasn’t confirmed with former President Clinton when he will be coming back to Georgetown, we anticipate that it will be sometime this semester,” Mulrooney said.
The Lecture Fund will also co-sponsor TEDx Georgetown, an independently organized branch of the global set of conferences in its third year on campus.
With this year’s theme, “Changemakers,” TEDx will make the move from Lohrfink Auditorium to Gaston Hall. University President John J. DeGioia is set to hold the panel discussion event Oct. 26.
“Though we can’t yet release the names of our speakers, this year’s TEDx Georgetown event is going to be more Georgetown-centric, as we will receive input from faculty, and other prominent officials associated with the Georgetown community, in order to make it hit home with a great number of students,” Mulrooney said.
The Lecture Fund works with other campus organizations, such as GU Pride, the Kalmanovitz Initiative and MAGIS Row, to plan and sponsor events. Last week’s kickoff lecture with President Barack Obama’s former speechwriter Jon Favreau was co-sponsored by the College Democrats.
While the Lecture Fund works with the administration to arrange lectures, Lecture Fund Vice Chair of Internal Affairs Marcus Stromeyer (SFS ’15) emphasized that it is primarily student run.
“The Lecture Fund works with the Georgetown University Programming Board and the University Office of Communications to get approval for speakers, and to discuss logistics,” Stromeyer said. “This is almost all a student-run process, from contract negotiations to ushering the events.”

Changes in the department of intramural sports to combat budget constraints have led to the creation of several new leadership positions for students within the program.
Five paid upper management positions were created for students within the program to fill the former role of Assistant Director of Intramurals Tim Smith, who assumed a new position at Yates Field House this semester.
“Everyone’s tightening their belts financially. The student-driven part of our program is the upper management who are involved in a lot more of our day-to-day decision making now,” Director of Intramurals Wedge Sullivan said.
The five upper management positions are an addition to four existing student positions. Sullivan chose student staffers based on their applications and, in many cases, their experience with the Intramural Department.
“It’s kind of a move-as-you-grow system — the more you are involved in a program, the more leadership you can take,” Sullivan said. “It seems to give the students more initiative. A lot of the people were already in supervisory positions.”
Staff Manager Will Pierce (MSB ’14) said he was satisfied with the implementation of the new system and the role students can now play in the administrative process.
“The best thing about it is that intramural sports are obviously a student-driven thing in the first place, so it’s very natural to have students running the process as well,” Pierce said. “Students know what other students want, so it’s easier to relate in that sense.”
Pierce also commented on the impact of the transition on relations between students and the university administration.
“It’s only been a month or two since it’s taken place, but overall, the administration has been very receptive,” Pierce said. “They’ve given us all the resources necessary to really succeed. And because it’s gone so well the first month or two, they’ve been pretty happy.”
One of the benefits of the new, student-run system has been better oversight of intramural officiating that the old system lacked.
“We evaluate on an ongoing basis supervisors and officials randomly every night,” head official Jim Burr (MSB ’14) said.
Given that many of these student positions are filled by seniors, Burr has already begun preparations for transferring leadership roles to younger students at the end of the year.
“It’s going to be challenging, it’s not going to be like in previous years when people just got the role, but we’re definitely looking to make sure that when we leave, there’s someone to fill the void,” Burr said.
Before the transition, student supervisors were limited in their leadership roles within the department.
“The professional directors handled most of the administrative things, the student supervisors just really had to do with game check-ins, just during the intramural shifts, and not really too much behind the scenes,” Social Media Coordinator Eric Johnson (COL ’14) said.
Johnson’s position as social media coordinator, which involves managing a Facebook page, tweeting photos of games and working on a blog, is new to the department.
The department of intramural sports has also cut costs by switching to a new administrative website to keep track of rosters, schedules, scores and playoff determination. The new, free software will save the department approximately $1,000 per month.
Overall, student and faculty reception of the new administrative system has been positive, according to Johnson.
“We’ve only had this for a month, so it’s tough to say how it’s been, but it definitely seems to be positive, students have taken on a lot more responsibility, and things have really been smooth,” he said.

Georgetown’s first massive open online course, “Globalization’s Winners and Losers: Challenges for Developed and Developing Countries,” launched on the edX platform last Tuesday to an audience of nearly 20,000 students from 155 countries.
“The fact that so many thousands of students all over the world are taking a course from a Georgetown professor is amazing to me. It extends our reach and our presence in all kinds of places. It allows us to help educate people in all kinds of different places,” School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster said. “It really is a manifestation of global Georgetown and all the good things that Georgetown can offer.”
The free class is taught by Theodore Moran, SFS professor and director of the Landegger Program in International Business Diplomacy, with help from a faculty support team including course manager Rosaelena O’Neil, four teaching assistants and various guest lecturers.
“The launch felt like NASA waiting for the Mars rover to land, all the TAs and I were sitting in the office and waiting for the clock to tick until 9 o’clock,” O’Neil said. “The moment that was really striking for me was to see that at about minute eight or 10 after the course had opened, the discussion boards were already humming across the world. Within the first couple of hours, people were forming study groups, asking questions.”
Overall, the MOOC launch was smooth, despite some minor technical malfunctions. For example, some multiple choice questions presented a glitch in grading, which was quickly corrected. The technical response was conducted by a joint team of edX and Georgetown staff.
The course primarily relies on readings, lectures and “knowledge checks,” usually multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank questions, polls and self-assessed open responses. O’Neil characterized the course as very flexible and adaptable to each student’s schedule because a key factor in the course’s setup was keeping students engaged. Based on edX research, Georgetown found that the limit to student attention span was approximately six to eight minutes.
“Every video has been capped so that it doesn’t lose engagement,” O’Neil said. “If you have only 10 minutes to devote to the class, you can watch a video, do three knowledge checks and then stop and come back later.”
In addition, students can respond to a written prompt via an optional Wiki site, allowing them to apply the knowledge that they have learned.
“We’re going to see a whole new evolution of content,” O’Neil said. “We’re looking at it as a way to engage our alumni and other learners in the world and promote debate on topics that are really important for the world to discuss.”
For student support, Moran holds “office hours” each Friday by uploading answers to the top five questions asked on the discussion board each week.
“It’s been one of the primary generators of the discussion,” O’Neil said. “Their reflection on the lectures, it has a nice flow.”
Students will have a final deadline in November by which they must complete all required assessments, although it is suggested that they finish each week’s work by the Monday before the next lecture is uploaded on Tuesday. In order to obtain the certificate of completion, which will read GeorgetownX rather than Georgetown University, students must finish all videos and pass 75 percent of the knowledge checks accurately.
“The points system is really there because that’s what the platform demands that we use,” O’Neil said. “We decided to create a pass level.”
A week after the course’s launch, faculty members have received requests from teachers in developing nations to use the course as an online textbook for their own classes.
O’Neil added that the diversity of the program was one of its strongest points. Student ages are approximately evenly split, with about 20 percent in their 20s, 30s and 40s, respectively, and the final 40 percent evenly dispersed among other age groups. There is also an even split between genders.
This diversity is also reflected in students’ backgrounds. Although many students are based in the United States, Senior Program Coordinator Joselyn Lewis said that across the board there is also strong representation from developing countries. For example, she pointed to a Nigerian banker with four children who was registered for the online course.
According to O’Neil, the woman responded to the survey with: “I really want to learn more about these issues that my country is facing, and I can do this in the privacy of my own home.”
Georgetown is also working on other MOOCs, including ones focused on counterterrorism, human genetics, human dignity and human rights. Although the “Introduction to Bioethics” MOOC was supposed to launch Oct. 15, due to logistical difficulties, the opening has been postponed to April 15.

The Secular Student Alliance, founded last year to raise awareness of secular issues on campus, was recently offered an unexpected home: Campus Ministry.
“We’re not a religious group, we’re not the Georgetown non-theist society. That would be interesting, but we’re not that. We have religious members,” SSA discussions leader Joseph Laposata (COL ’16) said. “Secularism is a wall between the two, and that’s what we stand for. Our banner when we table says, ‘Religion is a private matter.’ It’s not against religion, nor is it a view on it, so when were offered the Campus Ministry spot, we were mostly confused.”
The group forwent Campus Ministry membership on ideological grounds as well.
“They wanted us to change our name to the humanist club or something to do with humanism. Humanism is a different term. It has a lot of overlap with secularism, but it’s more towards the morality, being a good person part about it, which is great and is definitely incorporated into our club,” SSA Vice President and co-founder Ryan Eagan (COL ’15) said. “But we have other parts of the club, which we didn’t believe would overlap well with Campus Ministry.”
Instead, the group voted unanimously to join the Student Activities Commission in January. Like many Georgetown organizations, the club centers on community, education and service — a component that connects the group to religious organizations on campus. But SSA’s distinguishing characteristic is its focus on discussion and debate between its atheist, agnostic and religious members on a range of issues related to secularism.
“We saw lots of religious groups around campus … but unlike many other large universities around the country, there was no place for secular-minded people, people who didn’t necessarily believe in God,” Eagan said.
The club sometimes encounters animosity from people unfamiliar with its focus.
“On a personal level, I’ve had people scoff and then say, ‘What do you do?’” Director of Outreach Ian Marshall (SFS ’15) said. “Because there is sort of an idea that by its name, people assume it means atheist club.”
Though discussion is its main focus, SSA has rallied behind secular causes in the past. Last April, the group lobbied Campus Ministry to change a survey on student religious life that members felt did not fully reflect the nuances of the non-religious perspective. The SSA said that the survey did not initially include substantial response options for students with no faith.
Georgetown University Student Association senators Cannon Warren (SFS ’14) and Nicolò Donà dalleRose (SFS ’15) took up the issue with GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), and the issue was resolved when Campus Ministry issued a second survey.
SSA members said they do not object to Georgetown’s approach to religion in any other circumstances.
“Georgetown is a perfect example. On Georgetown buildings, there are crosses in the classrooms. Where there’s public money, like in the ICC, there’s no crosses,” Marshall said. “That’s what we’re looking for, essentially. That you keep the government out of religion, and we’re doing that at Georgetown.”

In an effort to restructure leadership on campus and to increase focus on interdisciplinary study, three new vice provost positions, created by Georgetown Provost Robert Groves last January, have been filled by current professors at Georgetown.
Georgetown’s new vice provost for research is biology and psychology professor Janet Mann. Public policy professor Adriana Kugler was named vice provost for faculty and Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship Executive Director Randall Bass was appointed vice provost for education. The position of vice provost for the finance and program analysis position has not been filled.
The Office of the Provost is conducting university-wide surveys to assess both current and desired collaborative efforts in interdisciplinary studies across campus.
“Once we have this data, we can determine the interdisciplinary strengths and also opportunities for growth,” Mann said.
As vice provost for education, Bass is taking steps to implement a form of interdisciplinary clusters or seminars that would link multiple courses from many subjects under one umbrella, ideally for a first-year group and eventually as a core requirement.
“Interdisciplinary programs are the future of growth,” Bass said. “We are trying to normalize that we can make interdisciplinary exposure a part of as many first-year students’ experience as possible.”
Bass is also responsible for guiding the evaluation of existing academic programs on campus. While he noted that the current system of academic review has been working well, in the future Bass hopes to collect more statistical data based on student experience, particularly from young alumni.
“Young alums help us think about the changing skill-set of a liberal education. By reaching out to them for critique, we are making an effort to help programs think about their own self-study,” Bass said. “We can then map that back to our curriculum.”
As vice provost for faculty, Kugler is working to support joint appointments of faculty across different schools. Since her appointment one month ago, Kugler has created guidelines to encourage more joint appointments, which are currently being looked over by the Faculty Senate for approval.
“The idea is that some schools do great with joint appointments and have been collaborating for years with different departments. We also have others that do not take advantage of these interdisciplinary appointments,” Kugler said.
Since her appointment as vice provost for research, Mann has started biweekly meetings with William Rebeck, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, to brainstorm how to support research efforts.
In order to make it easier for both faculty and students to explore research projects, Mann said that she would like to update the online Explore system, Georgetown’s current mode of searching for relevant faculty by research topic.
“We must strengthen quantitative skills in our undergraduate and graduate population. Students entering the workforce often need strong skills in collecting, analyzing and interpreting data,” Mann said. “The digital age has brought mass datasets to our fingertips and most of us don’t know how to take advantage of these opportunities and avoid pitfalls.”
Mann said that she is working to streamline the grants and administration system for research.
“Right now, faculty [members] spend too much time on administrative tasks,” Mann said. “They should be focusing on their scholarship and not filling out forms all the time. That is the goal of this new system.”
Kugler praised the university’s decision to employ current professors to fill the vice provost positions.
“At some universities, faculty and administrators are not tandem,” Kugler said. “I understand the challenges to being a faculty member and where we can find solutions to benefit the university as a whole. You don’t just forget what it is like to be a professor.”
Bass, too, saw the connection between his new role and his position at CNDLS.
“I see this position as a continuation, as the evolving nature of Georgetown has to continuously reinvent itself. We must look to the future and work with new concepts of design,” Bass said.
Groves could not be reached for comment.
