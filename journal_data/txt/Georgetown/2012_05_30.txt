A revamped version of the Graduate Management Admission Test, an entry test used by graduate business schools to determine eligible candidates, is set to be implemented June 5.
According to Ashok Sarathy, vice president of the GMAT program at the Graduate Management Admission Council, the changes reflect shifts in the business world and corresponding modifications to graduate business schools’ curricula.
Sarathy said that the heightened competition of the globalized business world has created a demand for superior data analysis and synthesis skills that are not specifically tested on the current version of the GMAT. He added that the changes were made based on surveys of business school administrators, students and recruiters over the last three years.
“[The GMAT] has to have validity. There has to be high correlation between performance on test and performance in business school … so we’ve made changes,” he said.
The updated test will include a new integrated reasoning section with questions designed to test data synthesis, evaluation and manipulation. According to GMAC Vice President for Global Communications Rich D’Amato, the sections that test quantitative and verbal communication skills will remain on the test. The new section will replace one of the GMAT’s two essays.
