Department of Public Safety officers will receive a $2.50 per hour pay raise as a result of an agreement between the university and Allied International Union, which represents DPS. The new three-year contract also increases the starting salary for new officers and provides new promotional opportunities, according to Andy Pino, Georgetown’s director of media relations.
“Earlier this month, the members of the Allied International Union ratified the university’s proposal for a three-year agreement that offers substantial pay increases for the university’s public safety officers,” Pino said. “The increases place the university’s security force among the best paid unarmed safety officers in the D.C. metro area.”
Negotiations for a new contract started last August. Allied International Union initially sought a $4 per hour salary increase for officers.
Under the new agreement, all newly hired DPS officers will be paid a starting salary ranging from $17 to $22 per hour depending on the officer’s experience and training, Pino said. Before the most recent agreement was reached, officers’ starting pay was $15.60 per hour.
Many students, particularly members of Georgetown Solidarity Committee, rallied in support of DPS’ push for higher pay, presenting an open letter to University President John J. DeGioia as negotiations continued in November. The students argued that a wage increase would help improve officer retention rate and increase the size of the DPS staff by attracting more candidates to Georgetown. Since the last set of negotiations between the university and DPS representatives in 2007, which resulted in a $2.50 per hour salary increase, former and current DPS officers have expressed dissatisfaction with their pay and training.
“The new agreement between DPS officers and Georgetown represents a step toward ending the revolving-door process that has occurred in DPS, and has been a detriment to student safety and has impeded the fair compensation of DPS officers in both pay and respect for their hard work,” said David Schwartz (SFS ’12), a member of Georgetown Solidarity Committee who was involved in the negotiations.
DPS will continue to seek more benefits in the next round of negotiations in 2013, according to Schwartz.
“Although the agreement for fair pay is reward for the efforts of students and the DPS officers working in solidarity, there is still room for improvement,” Schwartz said. “There is much work to be done concerning the opportunities for career advancement within DPS and cutbacks on investigative positions.”
Officer Victor Johnson, the DPS officer in charge of negotiations, could not be reached for comment. DPS personnel declined to comment.

The GOCard Office plans to launch a temporary card solution on March 1 for students, faculty and staff who misplace their primary card, according to Director of GOCard Services Roman Fahrmann.Users who lose or misplace their GOCards have, in the past, been required to pay a $25 fee to replace their card, Fahrmann said. With this new program, temporary cards would be issued for a one-week term until users can find their primary cards.
“We’ve always had feedback about the cost of replacement cards, and we’re trying to help out students who temporarily misplace cards,” Fahrmann said.
The temporary cards will look similar to the guest cards issued from GOCard vending machines, which are located in various on-campus locations such as Lauinger Library and O’Donovan Hall. Similar to the guest cards, they will serve as photo identification. Users will need to provide separate identification to certify transactions with the card. GOCard services is also working to make these cards available when the primary office is closed, Fahrmann said.
Rachel Braun (SFS ’12) said that she has been inconvenienced on multiple occasions after losing her GOCard over the weekend when the GOCard office is not open to dispense replacement cards. She cited difficulty accessing Leo’s and Lauinger Library until she could replace her card the following Monday.
“GOCard [Services] should realize that people tend to misplace or have cards stolen on the weekend, because people tend to get off campus more,” Braun said. “It’s harder to narrow down where you lose your card.”
The program is currently in its testing phase as GOCard service staff must ensure that the temporary solution is compatible with the several dozen types of card reader machines employed on campus and at neighborhood establishments.
A glitch in the GOCard system’s tests prevented some Henle Village residents from accessing their apartments last Friday through Sunday, Fahrmann said.
ike McClain (SFS ’12) swiped his card repeatedly on Friday to access his Henle apartment; the scanner signaled a flashing yellow light, rather than the green light that grants access to a stairwell. A replacement card from GOCard services similarly failed to unlock the door, he said.
Henle residents, including Nafees Ahmed (COL ’12), had to keep their exterior doors propped open in order to enter their stairwells without functioning GOCards. Ahmed used an empty Snapple bottle, she said, while others placed rocks to block the doors from closing so they could access their apartments.
Students and faculty said that the temporary solution meant that the safety of the residents was compromised and unauthorized guests could access the stairwells of the apartment complex. Henle Area Director Aja Holmes sent an e-mail to students on Sunday urging them not to lodge open the doors.
According to Fahrmann, the lockout error occurred during a nightly upload to the GOCard reader, when information about the temporary cards was inadvertently uploaded to Henle’s door access scanners. The temporary card data prevented the normal GOCards from operating correctly. The card readers were functioning again by Sunday afternoon, Fahrmann said.

Philly Pizza & Grill has officially lost a four month-long battle with D.C. authorities and Georgetown residents. Pending a published final order from the D.C. Board of Zoning Adjustment, the late-night haunt will be forced to shut its doors, saying goodbye to a loyal student clientele.
On Tuesday, in a seven-hour continuation of a meeting held on Jan. 12, the D.C. Board of Zoning Adjustment rejected Philly Pizza’s appeal in a 5-0 vote.
The Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs revoked Philly Pizza’s certificate of occupancy for a restaurant on Oct. 14, on the grounds that Philly Pizza operates as a fast food operation, not a restaurant. Philly Pizza appealed the DCRA’s decision to the Board of Zoning Adjustment, the highest zoning authority in the District. The four zoning adjustment board members and Chairman Marc Loud all voted to reject the appeal.
“The [DCRA] had absolute reason to revoke [the certificate of occupancy],” Loud said. “I join my colleagues in saying that this is a fast food operation.”
Martin Sullivan, the attorney for the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, which has strongly criticized Philly Pizza’s operations on behalf of Georgetown residents for months, and ANC Commissioner Bill Starrels cited a lack of dishwasher, the use of disposable dishware, public trashcans, security for crowds, and the overall carry-out numbers as proof that Philly Pizza operates as a fast food joint.
“Philly P’s is just not a restaurant. All credible, verifiable and consistent evidence suggests that instead of the 45 to 55 percent breakdown of on and off premises consumption, the breakdown is more like 95 to 5 percent,” Starrels said.
John Patrick Brown Jr., Philly Pizza’s attorney, argued that zoning investigator Terrell Hill did not spend enough time investigating Philly’s before making the recommendation for the DCRA to revoke the certificate of occupancy. He cited Hill’s lack of photos and the DCRA’s inability to produce a report on the status of Philly Pizza’s business operations.
“[Philly Pizza] is getting the death penalty without any documentation and with a shoddy investigation,” Brown said. “The [absence] of DCRA’s report really handicaps all of us.”
Mehmet Kocak, owner of Philly Pizza, denied ever meeting Hill, who allegedly spoke with him and provided incriminating evidence bolstering the zoning adjustment board’s decision. Kocak claimed he was overseas getting married and celebrating his honeymoon at the time Hill allegedly visited Philly Pizza.
It is not clear when Philly Pizza will be forced to close its doors following the vote.
“Philly’s will clear out whenever the city chooses to enforce the option. It could be as early as tomorrow,” Aaron Golds (COL ’11), the secretary and student representative of the ANC, said on Tuesday. “I honestly don’t know.”
Mike Rupert, the communications manager for DCRA, said, “DCRA cannot take enforcement action until the Board of Zoning Adjustment issues a published final order. As soon as we receive the official order, we can take action.”
Philly Pizza moved from its former 34th Street location to Potomac Street in October 2008, a move that angered neighboring Georgetown residents, many of whom were present at the meeting. The residents testified to excessive noise, rowdiness and the amount of carry-out as opposed to dine-in customers at the establishment. Starrels said that before Philly Pizza had moved from its 34th Street location to its current residence on Potomac Street, it went before a commission that posed several questions and concerns about the type of business the Philly Pizza owners would run. Starrels said that Philly Pizza presented itself as catering to a new crowd following the move, that it would not maintain the same business practices and would become more of a sit-down restaurant.
“[It’s a case of] a businessman that didn’t heed the obvious … There were other locations they could have moved to . The proceedings took a long time but in the end the right decision was done.”
While residents and the ANC commissioners seemed pleased by the outcome, many students lamented the loss of a favorite weekend dining option.
Carlos DelaTorre (COL ’13) said, “The prospect of Philly’s shutting down is just too much to bear . I frequent Philly P’s every Friday night and the scene in itself represents Georgetown.”
Students are now looking for new options.
“I’m sad Philly’s is closed, but I’m going to go to Tuscany’s, it’s just as good of an option,” said Nikhil Lakhanpal (MSB ’13).
Nour Kaei, the manager of Tuscany Café, which also serves pizza and is located around the corner from Philly Pizza on Prospect Street, provided little comment on the recent revocation of Philly’s certificate of occupancy, saying he had only recently been informed of the decision. “It’s too early to say [anything about the impact] . I don’t know.”

Georgetown University Student Association presidential candidates expressed contrasting viewpoints as they discussed funding reform, student security and other student life issues in the inaugural GUSA presidential debate that took place in Sellinger Lounge Wednesday evening.
 
The four candidates, Calen Angert (MSB ’11), Matt Wagner (SFS ’11), Arman Ismail (COL ’11) and Hillary Dang (SFS ’12), fielded questions from The Hoya, the Georgetown Voice, GUTV and members of the audience.
Speaking on his qualifications, Angert referred to his accomplishments in the past year as GUSA president.
 
“We’ve done a lot, but we’d like to do a lot more,” he said.
 
Wagner also discussed his experience with GUSA, having served two terms in the senate, which included two semesters as chair of the Finance and Appropriations Committee and two semesters as chair of the Academic Affairs Committee.
Ismail is a current GUSA senator; his running mate Tucker Stafford (COL ’12), a varsity football and lacrosse player, has never served in GUSA. Ismail called the pairing unconventional, but necessary. Dang and her running mate, Katie Balloch (COL ’12) have no prior GUSA experience; Dang characterized her inexperience as a strength.
 
“We’re outsiders of GUSA . We have a strong will to get things done,” Dang said. “We think we can bring the Georgetown community together with a different platform.”
 
After the four candidates delivered their introductory speeches, the media representatives were given the opportunity to ask a question of a randomly selected candidate. The candidates were allowed one-minute responses, with 30-second rebuttals by the other three candidates.
The first question was directed to Ismail about his campaign promise to change the relationship between the university and ARAMARK Higher Education, which provides food for on-campus dining halls. Angert, in his rebuttal, claimed that student concerns, such as the provision of soup in the Grab ‘n’ Go meals program, would be addressed when the contract with ARAMARK is renegotiated later this year. Wagner disputed this point, claiming that the contract would not expire this year.
Disagreements between Wagner and Angert continued during discussion of the funding reform that the GUSA senate passed on Feb. 8.
Wagner claimed that due to the annual turnover rate in the senate, GUSA will likely face challenges when allocating funds for student groups.
 
“The GUSA members do not have the institutional knowledge to run it. GUSA isn’t built for [club funding],” Wagner said.
 
Responses to Wagner’s remarks were varied. Ismail said he was one of the four senators to vote against the funding reform.
“Now that it has been passed, we must work with the legislation. We can’t switch from situation to situation,” Ismail said.
 
Dang said that she supports the reform that had been passed and believes that GUSA could act as an umbrella organization that understood and respected all student beliefs.
 
Finally, Angert responded to the criticism of legislation, which was one of his primary initiatives as president.
“The students called for [the GUSA Fund], and we really listened. This has been an issue for a while, and we’re doing something about it. We’re going to stick with [the GUSA Fund], but it will be dynamic,” Angert said. “There will always be room for adjustment. If something’s wrong, it can be changed.”
Wagner was later asked about his plan to host an event to familiarize students with off-campus housing availability. Wagner said he envisions inviting landlords from Burleith and West Georgetown to the event to make it easier for students to weigh their housing options. Wagner then used an anecdote from his own personal experiences dealing with a landlord to explain why a Web site, like the one proposed under Angert’s administration for students in search of off-campus housing, would not be effective.
Angert, in response, defended the Web site.
“[It would be] infeasible and incredibly difficult to gather all of the landlords in Georgetown,” Angert said.
Ismail agreed with Wagner, arguing that facilitating dialogue between the communities and the students would ease off-campus housing. Dang cited her support for the creation of a Web site for off-campus housing similar to those designed to help travelers find hostels in Europe.
On-campus safety was another issue that was heavily debated among the candidates.
Dang argued that SafeRides needed to be expanded on campus and more responsive to student calls. She proposed that the SafeRides Neighborhood Shuttle operate on a regular schedule. She voiced her support for Angert’s reform to make more SafeRides shuttles student-operated, but argued that there were limitations.
“We need SafeRides driven by [the Department of Public Safety], for emergencies, so that students feel safer,” Dang said.
Wagner suggested that one of the ways to ensure greater safety on campus would be to install more cameras in heavily trafficked areas to supplement the cameras in front of Lauinger Library.
Ismail argued for a hands-on approach to student safety and cooperation with the Department of Public Safety.
 
“Neither Tucker nor I are experts on security, so the day after the elections, we would talk to DPS, listen to what they have to say about security, and act upon their suggestions,” Ismail said.
 
He also called for greater accountability from both student and AlliedBarton professional guards in student housing.
Angert, expanding on some of his earlier reforms, argued for putting more DPS officers on foot or on bicycles in order to expand their range of coverage and effectiveness.
Despite these disagreements, there were some issues that all of the candidates were able to agree upon. All four candidates called for a stronger relationship between the greater student body and GUSA. They also agreed that GUSA needed to be a transparent organization, and that there needed to be increased dialogue between GUSA and both the organizations that represent campus diversity and with the greater Georgetown community.”
