A security guard shot and wounded a man who stabbed a woman in Union Station around 1 p.m. Friday, resulting in a brief evacuation of the station, according to the Metropolitan Police Department.
MPD Director of Communications Gwendolyn Crump indicated the stabbing may have been a domestic dispute, according to CNN, although the details of the stabbing are still unconfirmed.
The shot was fired near a McDonald’s restaurant around the Amtrak terminals, according to The Washington Post.
Immediately following the gunshot, MPD tweeted that it was not an active shooter situation.

School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman made his first public appearance Wednesday at the inauguration of the second semester of the Global Futures Initiative lecture series in Gaston Hall.
Hellman spoke on overcoming governance issues, and his speech was followed by a discussion with Stéphane Dujarric (SFS ’88), spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
The event, entitled “Challenges to Global Governance,” ushered in this semester’s series topic — the global future of governance.
Vice President for Global Engagement Thomas Banchoff, who leads the Global Futures Initiative, introduced the mission of the event.
“We had two goals: to introduce Dean Hellman to the SFS and the wider university community and also kick off the second semester of the Global Futures Initiative,” Banchoff said.
The major focus of Hellman’s remarks was the issue of development within the world’s “fragile states” — defined as such because of the lack of objective standards of institutional quality and the presence of peacekeeping forces or conflict.
According to Hellman, these 33 nations are spread across four continents and include developing countries like Haiti, South Sudan, Afghanistan and Iraq. These countries pose significant challenges to global development as a result of their instability.
“This group of fragile states is really sort of the source of many of the major issues that are affecting us today,” Hellman said.
Hellman addressed many of the specific issues that fragile states now face, including extreme poverty, a smaller share of international development assistance than other developing nations, inadequate local aid distribution architecture, security concerns, institutional inefficiency and corruption.
“Extreme poverty is declining at unprecedented rates,” Hellman said, citing World Bank statistics showing that from 1993 to 2011, global poverty levels fell from 41 to 17 percent. “If we look at governments that we term fragile states, we see that poverty rates there have pretty much stayed stable over a long period of time and in fact even more recently there has been an uptick in poverty rates in the fragile states.”
In general, Hellman said development in fragile states requires new approaches to state-building.
“If we look down at governments [of fragile states], especially local governments, we see that state-building often looks different than our assumptions of what we think it is,” Hellman said. “It is often an empty room, with a single desk, with a single powerful individual who uses individual relationships … lacking … everything that you need to create a state. How do you build a state in that kind of environment?”
In order to address these issues, Hellman suggested that he would like Georgetown students to examine them in their studies.
“We need to fundamentally rethink these issues,” Hellman said.
“Georgetown offers the opportunity at its School of Foreign Service in particular … to really rethink these issues in a different way.”
Hellman also noted that Georgetown’s connection to a global Jesuit network of relief services and universities — many of which exist in fragile states — could be leveraged to combat issues of global governance.
“We also have one other advantage here at Georgetown that I want to think very seriously about, which is our Jesuit values, of course, but also the Jesuit organizational network,” Hellman said.
Dujarric also noted Georgetown’s ability to combat international issues of governance.
“I think that a school like Georgetown has a role to play in training people differently, in producing different types of graduates who then go into the international world, into development aid,” Dujarric said.
The event concluded with a question-and-answer session with the audience and students watching live from the Qatar campus.
Teresa Eder (SFS ’17) said that attending the event changed her view of the state of global affairs.
“The event shifted my focus to the fact that fragile states are the ones we have to focus on if we are talking about future development policies,” Eder said.
Tsai Chih Tang (SCS ’16), a student in the Business Professional English program, said the event may guide his future aspirations.
“[The event] did affect my viewpoint in a way that it gives me the thought of devoting myself to international humanitarian operations in the future,” Tsai said.

The university’s capital campaign, “For Generations to Come: The Campaign for Georgetown,” has passed its goal of $1.5 billion, nearly a year ahead of schedule.
University President John J. DeGioia announced the milestone, which was hit at the end of August, in a university-wide email yesterday.
Launched in October 2011, the project is divided into four objectives: ensuring access for students, enhancing student life and community experience, pursuing transformative opportunities and promoting faculty excellence and academic excellence.
In a statement to The Hoya, DeGioia emphasized the immense accomplishment that this milestone represents.
“We began this campaign by setting out a new and ambitious goal for our university — a recognition of the extraordinary commitment to service and leadership that defines the Georgetown community,” DeGioia wrote.
DeGioia said that the goal was achieved thanks to a large amount of donations from alumni, parents and other donors over the past few years.
“I wish to express my sincere gratitude to the 100,000 alumni and other donors who have shown their support during this campaign and have helped to share and shape our vision for Georgetown’s future,” DeGioia wrote.
The campaign has raised $373 million for student scholarships — quadrupling past annual results — and has increased alumni participation in annual giving by nearly 40 percent.
So far, the campaign has endowed and established multiple centers, buildings and programs at Georgetown, including the McCourt School of Public Policy in 2013, the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation in 2014, the Steers Center for Global Real Estate in May 2015 and the John R. Thompson Jr. Intercollegiate Athletics Center, slated to open August 2016.
The milestone comes with a renewed emphasis from university officials to increase Georgetown’s endowment, which was valued at $1.4 billion at the end of the 2014 fiscal year. Since then, parts of the endowment have been allocated toward specific projects.
According to William Doyle (CAS ’72), current chair of the university’s board of directors and chair of the Campaign for Georgetown, the campaign still has to expand its funding for financial aid.
“There are still several important objectives to accomplish, most notably scholarships and financial aid, which benefit every single aspect of the entire university,” Doyle wrote on the university website in a post published yesterday.
The campaign will continue to solicit contributions until June 30, 2016, focusing on two priorities — raising $500 million for student scholarships and seeking an overall 35 percent undergraduate alumni participation rate.
Undergraduate involvement in the campaign has been particularly evident through the “One for Georgetown” campaign by the 1634 Society, an organization founded in 2011 with the goal of increasing young alumni giving through garnering initial donations from current students. Another major initiative that has contributed to the funding is Phonathon, in which students call alumni to ask for donations.
With large-scale fundraising efforts beginning only in the 1970s, Georgetown has a relatively modest endowment, in contrast with academically comparable universities. According to a 2014 NACUBO-Commonfund Study on Endowments, the University of Notre Dame has an endowment of approximately $8 billion, the University of Pennsylvania’s endowment is approximately $9.6 billion and Harvard University’s endowment is valued at $35.9 billion.
In comparison to Georgetown’s $1.5 billion fundraising campaign target, Harvard launched a $6.5 billion fundraising campaign in September 2013, and has already raised over $4.8 billion as of January 2015.
Doyle said that Georgetown needs to keep building on current momentum to accomplish further objectives.
“We’ve surpassed the original dollar goal and we’re justifiably proud about that, but we want to keep building momentum until the very end,” Doyle wrote.

While Georgetown remains at the 21st spot on U.S. News & World Report’s National Universities Ranking list, the university dropped from first to 16th on the Best Colleges for Veterans list. The 2016 Best Colleges rankings were released Wednesday.
Richard Hare, a representative from U.S. News, attributed the dramatic shift in rankings for veterans to changes in the organization’s methodology.
Institutions qualified for the 2016 rankings if they are certified for both the G.I. Bill and a participant in the Yellow Ribbon Program, a post-9/11 bill that pays full tuition and fees for veterans at public schools and a considerable portion of tuition at private universities. From there, eligible schools were listed in order according to their placement on the overall National Universities Ranking list.
Missing from this year’s criteria to make the list was a third requirement that an institution must belong to the Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges Consortium, an organization formed in 1972 to further aid student veterans. As it disbanded this past year, this standard was removed from U.S. News’ methodology, resulting in a rise from 311 to 721 schools eligible for the list.
Although Georgetown fits the above criteria, the addition of several hundred schools to the list resulted in a ranking drop.
Georgetown’s Veterans Office Director LeNaya Hezel pointed to the changes in methodology and did not express any disappointment with the drop in ranking.
“We are honored to be recognized in the ‘Best Colleges for Veterans’ category and to provide opportunities
to military students to pursue higher education at any point in their career,” Hezel wrote in an email to The Hoya.
U.S. Army Captain Jim Perkins (GRD ’16), president of the Georgetown University Student Veterans Association, said the rankings are not an accurate reflection of an institution’s support for military members.
“There is no quantitative or qualitative measure of how much of a resource is being given to student veterans,” Perkins said.
He added that Georgetown’s efforts to provide additional aid for student veterans go far beyond the criteria outlined in U.S. News.
“From the perspective of the university, they’ve actually done a lot in terms of partnerships with outside organizations and fostering all of that stuff inside the university that is specifically targeted at helping student veterans,” Perkins said.
Perkins specifically referenced collaborations with organizations such as Service to School and Four Block, which offer services such as providing support for veterans in the admissions process, transition to civilian life, job search and various other challenges.
“These are all things that even under the previous ranking methodology, U.S. News & World Report would’ve never really even picked up on,” Perkins said.
One additional resource for student veterans at Georgetown is the first military prospective students day for MBA candidates at the McDonough School of Business Nov. 12. For student veteran applicants who choose to apply in the first round of admissions, the school sets up on-campus interviews for the following day, a convenient feature of the program Perkins said sets Georgetown apart from other institutions.
“This is something that comparably exceeds most other MBA programs,” Perkins said. “We’re really proud of making that choice.”
Other notable appearances throughout the 2016 lists included a ninth ranking for undergraduates studying international business and 14th and 15th rankings for graduate law and public policy programs, respectively. In both the overall university and veterans rankings, Georgetown is tied with Emory University.
Georgetown’s highest rating, however, came with the eighth spot on the list compiled from surveys of high school counselors. U.S. News collected, “high school counselor reputation scores,” using the average of surveys from 2013-2015 of counselors from public high schools. Counselors assigned schools ratings on a scale of one to five, based on their perceived quality of a given school’s undergraduate education.

September 11, 2015 by Toby Hung 2 Comments 
Upon descending the stairs to the second floor of the Intercultural Center, a quaint but easily overlooked sculpture can be observed toward the right wall. The bronze statue depicts a scene in the Parable of the Prodigal Son, in which the titular character embraces his father after returning from a path of rebellion.
Only a handful of people know that the statue was brought to Georgetown by former Senior Jewish Chaplain Rabbi Harold S. White, who approached its sculptor, Barry Woods Johnston, in 1983. To many members of the community, White himself charted an iconoclastic path at the university.
As the first full-time Jewish chaplain at a Catholic university in the United States, White persistently defied traditional boundaries set by religious and political doctrines. He sought a deeper connection and understanding between people of all religious and cultural backgrounds through his work in the Jewish ministry, his founding of the Program for Jewish Civilization and the hundreds of interfaith weddings he officiated over the past half a century.
White died Aug. 31 of complications from a stroke. He was 83 years old.
In a university-wide email sent on the day White passed away, University President John J. DeGioia commended White for his impact on Georgetown as an institution that welcomes diversity.
“Rabbi White’s devotion to our shared values and our mission as a community was unparalleled,” DeGioia wrote. “His leadership and vision in creating opportunities for dialogue strengthened our community and helped build the ethos of engagement that characterizes our campus ministry today.”
White is survived by his son, Ross McQuilkin. The university will hold a memorial service in celebration of White’s life on Sept. 20 in Gaston Hall.
Yotzei Dofen
Born in 1932 to Jewish immigrants from Austria, White grew up in Connecticut and studied philosophy at Wesleyan University before receiving his rabbinical ordination at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.
White arrived at Georgetown in 1968, three years after the Vatican released “Nostra Aetate,” a declaration that repudiated the Catholic Church’s prior prejudices against Jews and other practitioners of non-Christian faiths.
According to PJC Associate Director Rev. Dennis McManus, White was not hired to serve Jewish students, as there were very few on campus at the time. Rather, the rabbi was tasked with educating the entire student body about Judaism.
“Harold White was ‘Nostra Aetate’ at Georgetown. He’s the one who opened the door for us to understand that on a daily basis. He’s the one who got us going. The most important thing he did was consent to that job offer,” McManus said.
From then on, White’s dedication to interreligious understanding transformed Georgetown. Students of all religious backgrounds frequently crowded the hallway outside his Healy Hall office, competing for a time slot to engage the rabbi in discussion.
For many in the Jewish community, White is best remembered in his rabbinical robe, delivering sermons on the stage of Gaston Hall for High Holy Days services, open to the general public.
Israel Klein (COL ’99), a friend and former student of White’s, said that even after he graduated, he returned to Georgetown to attend White’s sermons.
“You really had to make it a point to get there early. They are extremely well attended,” Klein said. “The way [White] conducted a service was really inclusive. It was open and accessible to everybody. You were made to feel at home.”
Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rachel Gartner, who assumed White’s position after he retired in 2010, said that he solidified Georgetown as a welcoming institution to Jewish students.
“Over my last four years here. I’ve heard repeatedly [from Jewish alumni] that it was Rabbi White who made Georgetown feel like home for them,” Gartner said.
Theology and fine arts Professor Ori Soltes, who was initially recommended for a teaching position at Georgetown by White two decades ago, described him as yotzei dofen, a Hebrew phrase that roughly translates to “outstanding.”
“I think of him as not just outstanding, but in the etymological sense of the Hebrew, as someone beyond the norm,” Soltes said. “He was always reaching in different directions that took him away from the safely circumscribed, the mainstream. And often, he ended up bringing the mainstream, dragging it with him in the direction he took.”
White was not only known for bridging religious groups in the public sphere. He also played a significant role in the personal lives of many interfaith couples. At a time when interfaith marriages were still relatively unaccepted by most religious communities, many turned to White to perform their ceremonies.
White officiated the wedding of Vice President for Public Affairs Erik Smulson (CAS ’89) and Jennifer Beard (CAS ’89). The Jewish-Catholic couple met at Georgetown, and asked the rabbi and Rev. James Shea, S.J., to preside over their nuptials.
Smulson said that the rabbi provided endless guidance for the marriage.
“As we were leading up to our wedding, Rabbi really reinforced our patience and understanding with each other,” Smulson said. “It wasn’t always easy, but to have Rabbi and Fr. Shea there was a big part of our lives.”
An Inspired Teacher
Beyond his role in the Jewish chaplaincy and ministry, both students and faculty said they considered White an incredible and highly knowledgeable educator.
Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., said that White’s teachings were instrumental to his development as a Catholic priest.
“My relationship with [White] has made me a better person, a better Catholic, a better priest,” O’Brien said. “He helped me to understand my own Christian tradition in a new way from a Jewish perspective. … [He was] an inspired teacher.”
From his first days at Georgetown, White longed to create an academic center focusing on the different dimensions of Judaism, according to McManus. After an extensive fundraising period under his leadership, the Program for Jewish Civilization was launched as a program within the School of Foreign Service in late 2003.
After he retired, he continued to serve as an advisor to the program, which also saw the establishment of the Harold White Chair in Jewish Civilization made possible by alumni donations.
Next February, the PJC will officially be expanded into the Center for Jewish Civilization, which will push forward plans to create a major and a master of arts degree in Jewish civilization.
McManus said that the center is a testament to White’s continued influence on Georgetown.
“He knew about this before he passed, and that elicited a huge smile. He understood this was actually going to happen and we were going to be a center. It was the culmination of his life’s work,” McManus said.
Aside from the PJC, White was a professor who brought his endless thirst for knowledge to the lecture hall.
McManus, who co-taught a popular course on the dialogue between the Abrahamic religions called “Interreligious Encounter and Dialogue” with White and Imam Yahya Hendi, said that White’s approach to teaching was dynamic and engaging.
“He’d make his notes fresh every single time. He’d come in and say, ‘You know what, I’ve changed my view on something.’ [It was] a new surprise a week,” McManus said. “‘Why not?’ he would say. ‘Why not continue to change? It means that you’re growing and seeing new things. You should bring them in. You shouldn’t be afraid of that.’”
Hesham El Abd (GSB ’76), another friend and former student, agreed that White consistently welcomed new perspectives into the classroom.
“I was the only non-Jewish student in his class,” El Abd said. “You can imagine, I’m sitting there and you have 15, 17 Jewish students. He would say, ‘Okay, Hesham, but what about Islam?’ It added to the discussion and dialogue.”
El Abd continued a friendship that lasted decades with the rabbi, who had made plans to spend Thanksgiving with him in Cairo this year.
White also co-officiated El Abd’s wedding in 1983. Neither the bride nor groom was Jewish — he was Muslim, she was Presbyterian. Still, White performed a ceremony unique to El Abd and his wife.
“You could plan any wedding with Harold, and Harold would wake up that morning, decide what he’s going to do and he’d do it,” El Abd said. “You don’t call the rabbi if you want it to be by the book.”
Marin
In his lifetime, White fostered relationships that transcended religious, cultural and political borders.
“Thousands of people would say that he was their friend, and they would all be absolutely correct,” said Richard Chused, a former professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and a friend whose wedding White officiated.
Hendi, who became the first full-time Muslim chaplain hired by a Catholic university in 1999, pointed to a memorable experience in which he, Rev. Raymond Kemp and White blessed each other at the Jordan River during a trip that focused on interfaith dialogue.
“How rare would it have been for a Christian to be blessed by a Muslim and a Jew? People started taking pictures of this, and we became celebrities for almost half an hour,” Hendi said.
For Hendi, White’s connection with others stemmed from his marin, an Arabic word that means flexibility or elasticity.
“He wanted for everyone to be happy,” Hendi said. “He was one of those people who were naturally not willing to fight.”
Yet, despite his easygoing nature, White fought tirelessly for a society that embraced differences.  He was an advocate for not only religious but also racial equality, having participated in the civil rights movement in 1961 as a Freedom Rider.
PJC Director Jacques Berlinerblau said that White’s acceptance was a rare quality that left a lasting impression on those who knew him.
“He was an enemy of close-mindedness, philistinism, homophobia, racism and any type of prejudice,” Berlinerblau said. “He didn’t look at somebody and just draw assumptions from that. For an 83-year-old Jewish man, having gone through what Jews had gone through in the 20th century, that was sublime.”
Correction: White co-officiated the wedding of Erik Smulson and Jennifer Beard with Rev. James Shea, S.J., rather than Rev. James Schall, S.J., as the original article incorrectly stated.

Sad to read of the passing of Rabbi White. Should all folks take a
page from his book, this would be a better World for sure.
I too, find enemies with close minded, judgmental and racist
individuals. Conversation and an openness creates the way to
true understanding.
I’m new to Georgetown, so it’s my loss, for not being able to
meet this Mench.

There’s a tribute to Rabbi White from The Georgetown Academy written about 15 years ago that is spot on about what a mensch he was . . .

Seven actors took to the stage at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts’ Terrace Theater Monday for a 50-minute reading of the student-written “Pandemopium,” Georgetown’s entry to the 14th annual Page-to-Stage Festival.
The play, written by Connor Rohan (COL ’16), centers on the daily life of an Afghan poppy farmer, Ashraf, played by Adly Alec Abdel-Meguid (COL ’17), in rural Kandahar, Afghanistan. Ashraf holds a duel loyalty to his family’s safety and his livelihood, which depends on the Taliban-controlled opium market.
The yearly festival aims to support more than 40 theater companies in the D.C. area through public readings and rehearsals of their new works. “Pandemopium” opened to a crowd of Georgetown alumni, students and faculty, as well as Kennedy Center regulars. Rohan’s work won the Donn B. Murphy One-Acts Festival prize last year. Director of Theater and Performance Studies Maya Roth, who directed the staging, worked to bring the play to the Kennedy Center stage. 
“Georgetown always liked to feature students or alumni works [at Page-to-Stage], and I talked to a faculty professor who suggested Connor’s work as exceptional,” Roth said. “It’s unsettling and taut and humane and unexpected, which hooked us.”
Rohan conceptualized and penned the play in the spring while taking the “Hope Playwriting Seminar,” taught by theater professor Christine Evans. The subject matter and title of the play, though, originated from a paper he wrote in a government course.
“My interest in Afghan opium started as purely academic,” Rohan said in a question–and–answer session after the performance, eliciting chuckles from the audience. “I had the opportunity to write a paper in my “Comparative Political Systems” class and discovered how pervasive [opium] was in Afghan culture.“
As a longtime member of the Georgetown University Improv Association and the Georgetown Heckler, Rohan originally set out to write a comedy. However, because of the gravity of his subject, Rohan quickly realized that his piece required less levity if he wanted to authentically tackle the issue.
“I said that I was going to write a comedy, and I soon found that just because of the subject matter that could not be,” Rohan, who also serves as vice president of the Georgetown University Student Association, said. “Ninety percent of the world’s opium comes from Afghanistan, and 70 percent of the Taliban’s funding comes from Afghan opium. … It is easier and was easier to get opium than food.”
Instead, Rohan sprinkled moments of comedy into a tense and intentionally complex landscape of relationships between Ashraf’s family, business and nationality.
“A lot of the issue in foreign policy related to Afghanistan is oversimplification,” Rohan said. “However, these are very complex societies with complex, deeply rooted issues of identity and association. There are a lot of real people. There is no real good or pure evil.”
Roth also acknowledged that the Page-to-Stage reading allowed an open exploration of Rohan’s text that may not have been possible in full production — namely, without an entirely Afghan cast.
“I felt that we had this freedom to share this play that would be hard for Georgetown as a campus to pull off, and even for maybe a professional theater in D.C. to pull off,” Roth said. “But Georgetown was also a gift in [that] I [cast] people who can engage the subject in the play … who have some understanding of, some interest in some of the range of issues in the text.”
Instead of looking to cast actors of Afghan backgrounds, Roth pulled seven talented students and alumni with varying experiences in Middle Eastern studies; all actors came from Georgetown, with the exception of Jesse Robinson, a senior at Rohan’s previous school, George Mason University. Roth pointed to Asif Majid (GRD ’15), who played Ashraf’s brother-in-law Said and recently graduated with his masters in conflict resolution at Georgetown. Additionally, Roth looked to cast students who spoke Arabic, which aided in the final reading.
“My initial hope was to do dialect work so that we could do justice to the text in a reading,” Roth said. “Ultimately, due to time constraints, it was important to work more on the acting.” Sarah Kelly Konig (COL ’16), who served as the play’s stage manager, added a soundtrack of gunfire throughout the reading, as well as picture cards depicting poppy fields, helicopters and Afghan children to mitigate time and staging constraints. Anna Arena (COL ’17), who attended Monday’s reading, said she was convinced of the text’s realistic portrayal of the conflict, despite limits on rehearsal time and staging.
“I thought that was realistic and addressed the conflict well,” Arena said. “I think … realizing that these people have been living in this state of perpetual insecurity for so long and that within that, life does go on somehow and there are elements of humor in daily life.”
Roth hoped that the audience would grapple with the insecurity not only in the text, but also apply the play to present-day conflicts as well.
“The larger question about what is going to happen in Afghanistan and in the region,” Roth said. “I think it’s important that the play is unsettling at its end, so people start thinking, ‘Maybe I should know more, or that this is more complicated than I think it is.“
While the staged reading was the first time Rohan had heard and seen his play in full, Roth said she hopes it will not be the last time.
“Our hope is that there are a couple of theaters who could actually cast this, and so we’ll share it and hope that it finds a place in the world,“ Roth said.

Mayor Muriel Bowser announced her plan to address Washington, D.C.’s homelessness crisis response system with a set of proposed administrative and legislative policy changes during a meeting with the District’s Interagency Council on Homelessness Sept. 1.
“Homelessness can seem so big and so insurmountable, but the fact is we can quantify the challenge,” Bowser said during the official announcement. “A city as prosperous as ours should and must solve the problem of homelessness.”
An expanded homeless shelter application process, a new interim shelter option during that process and additional housing options are among the changes and proposed legislation Bowser outlined.
Additionally, Bowser’s budget for the 2016 fiscal year, “Pathways to the Middle Class,” included a $23 million down payment toward reducing homelessness. The mayor’s office also pledged to establish new emergency housing throughout the District to replace the existing D.C. General Family Shelter.
Previous policy dictated that the District would only accept shelter applications from homeless families on nights when the temperature dropped below freezing — a time known as hypothermia season — which historically resulted in a large demand crunch. Only 1,007 of the 1,942 families that applied for shelter last winter were offered housing, according to the Washington Post.
However, Bowser’s administration implemented a year-round application process for shelter in April.
D.C. Department of Human Services Director Laura Zeilinger also spoke about the necessity of providing families with both an emergency response system and a strong support system once they are placed in housing.
“People with children need to have a safe place to be when there is a housing crisis,” Zeilinger said. “It is very important that we have a crisis response system that has all of the necessary tools.”
Additionally, Bowser and her team proposed two main changes to the city law to be enacted later this year, pending D.C. Council approval.
The first is to amend the configuration of family shelters so that the District has the ability to shelter homeless families in both apartments and private rooms in addition to current public spaces.
“These new emergency housing facilities will be safe, clean, modern developments with private rooms for families and the amenities and services they need to succeed in the long run,” according to the Office of the Mayor’s website.
The second proposal involves amending the Homeless Services Reform Act, which dictates that homeless families must prove that they have nowhere safe to stay before being admitted to a shelter.
Bowser’s amendment would allow for an interim shelter of at least 12 days to families applying for housing as the city determines their eligibility, starting this November.
D.C. Councilmember David Grosso expressed support for Bowser’s initiative in an email to The Hoya.
“It is very important that we change our approach to homelessness,” Grosso wrote. “For too long, we have been warehousing individuals and families in decrepit buildings, without sufficient services to help people get back on their feet and lead successful, self-sufficient lives.”
Zeilinger was similarly optimistic regarding the success of the initiative.
“It’s going to be hard, but I have full confidence that we will be very effective,” Zeilinger said. “It is such an exciting time in D.C. that the mayor is fully committed to creating a system of care that works for homeless families. The time is really now for us to fix what has been broken for a long time.”
Grosso offered an example of these facilities and highlighted suggestions for more effective ways to provide housing to families in need.
“After visiting some of the shelters for our homeless individuals, I was appalled at the conditions,” Grosso wrote. “People were only let in for the night, were kicked out at 7 a.m., and were not provided any services. I think we have models in the city to help people out of homelessness effectively, such as Friendship Place, which offers wrap-around services with an emphasis on housing and employment as well as mental health supports.”
Bowser and the District’s ICH are enacting these changes in accordance with the Homeward D.C. plan, a citywide initiative that aims to significantly reduce homelessness over the next five years.
Grosso added that homelessness has been a citywide concern for years and supports efforts to address the issue.
“Our efforts must continue to focus on preventing people from becoming homeless, while effectively supporting those who are homeless to get back on their feet,” Grosso wrote.

Nearly 200 students packed the Healey Family Student Center Social Room Wednesday night to listen to two experts on nuclear proliferation, Professor Matthew Kroenig and National Security Advisor to the Vice President Colin Kahl debate the recent accord reached with Iran.  The event was hosted by the College Democrats and co-sponsored by the Georgetown Israel Alliance, the International Relations Club, J Street U and the Security Studies Program. The debate was moderated by Ariane Tabatabai, a visiting professor for the SSP.
In the event, Kroenig argued against the deal, while Kahl expressed his support for it. Both acknowledged that the deal was nearly guaranteed to pass in Congress, a prediction that was proven correct when Democrats blocked a resolution of disapproval of the deal from going to vote.
While the debate marks the third time the two have clashed over Iranian proliferation, it is the first time they have publically debated about the topic in person. In 2012, Kroenig published an article in Foreign Affairs titled “Time to Attack Iran,” to which Kahl replied in the next issue with a rebuttal, “Not Time to Attack Iran.” Two years later, Kroenig published another piece in support of an attack in Foreign Affairs, to which Kahl replied for the second time with an article titled “Still Not Time to Attack Iran.”
Before starting the debate, Tabatabai provided an overview of the deal.
“What it aims to do is to ensure that Iran is prevented from creating nuclear weapons by enforcing international inspections and reducing Iran’s nuclear capabilities. In exchange, Iran is going to receive sanctions relief, which are hurting Iran’s economy,” Tabatabai said.
The debate began with three-minute opening statements from Kroenig and Kahl. Following the opening statements, the debate rotated the questions between the debaters with a two-minute response to a question followed by a one-minute rebuttal and 30-second counter-rebuttal.
In his opening remarks, Kroenig expressed doubts about Iran’s trustworthiness and asserted that the deal was only short-term, allowing Iran to expand its conventional weapons programs.
“We need to be skeptical. We’re dealing with a dangerous adversary,” Kroenig said. “There is a difference between operating a peaceful nuclear program, operating reactors for research or energy purposes and making the fuel for those reactors, because once you have the ability to make the fuel for reactors, you also have the ability to make the fuel for nuclear weapons.”
Kroenig continued by pointing out benchmarks of the deal that allow Iran to buy conventional weapons in six years and have ballistic missiles by eight years time, which he argued would allow them to build Intercontinental Ballastic Missiles that could hit the East Coast.
On the other hand, Kahl expressed his support for the deal, labelling it as a diplomatic way to resolve the conflict.
“What the president has made clear from the beginning is that a peaceful diplomatic solution is ultimately the most enduring and sustainable solution to this problem, and that’s the solution that we have,” Kahl said.
Kahl further argued that the deal was an effective long-term solution.
“It’s a good deal. It closes off the various pathways by which Iran could get a bomb; the uranium pathway, the plutonium pathway and the covert pathway,” Kahl said. “Right now, without this deal, Iran could produce highly enriched uranium for its first nuclear weapon in as little as two to three months,”
Throughout the debate, Kahl referred to Kroenig’s arguments for a better deal as “crazy talk” and “fantasy,” suggesting that other countries would abandon negotiations if the United States gave up the deal.
Kroenig responded by saying that Kahl was stuck in a “White House echo chamber.”
“I’m the one living in the real world, who understands power dynamics and understands these issues,” Kroenig said.
Katie Kelly (SFS ’19) said she attended the event because she wanted to hear alternative views on the Iran deal.
“Before the event I was mainly against the deal,” Kelly said. “I felt if there was lifted sanctions there would be more money that the Iranian government could deal to anti-American terrorist groups, and both sides agreed on that point.”
Jawad Pullin (COL ’18), a member of the College Democrats who helped to organize the event, said he supports the deal and hopes the event sparked dialogue.
“[We wanted it to be] an objective debate to bring the campus out to see two sides of the issue,” Pullin said.

I strongly disagree with Katie Kelly who is misrepresenting the views of humble Utahns like me.

Students and administrators celebrated the topping off of the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall Wednesday with guided tours of the building, which revealed its interior to the public for the first time.
The residence hall is expected to include rooms for 225 students, the majority of whom will be sophomores. Construction for the building, which came to $46 million, began last year and is expected to be completed by August 2016 as part of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement to house 385 more students on campus by this semester.
In the meantime, two floors of the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center have been converted into temporary housing as construction of the NET continues.
The topping off event began with a series of speeches in Red Square, where Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson thanked all those involved in the planning and building of the new dorm.
“This is an exciting moment, as we continue to make Georgetown an even more vibrant residential campus and a great place for living and learning for all our students,” Olson said.
Topping off ceremonies are traditionally held when the last beam is placed atop a structure. The eight-story NET was officially topped off on Sept. 5.
Prior to the tour, students who attended the event had the opportunity to sign two beams that will be placed in the elevator shaft of the building.
Senior Project Executive at Gilbane Building Company Robert Walcott said that student input has influenced the design process.
“The topping off has always been a big deal and I’m glad to share it with Georgetown and the students,” Walcott said. “We’d like to keep that student involvement moving through the project.”
The NET will be the first residence hall on campus that is certified by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design system from the United States Green Building Council, which indicates that the building uses resources efficiently.
According to building architect Vinicius Gorgati, the entire building, which includes a green roof and rainwater harvesting system, was designed with the environment in mind.
“This building has a very significant sustainable agenda, everywhere from the quality of the glass to the quality of the air in the building,” Gorgati said. “It’s a very serious endeavor.”
The first floor of the building will function as a new student center, complete with a lounge area and multipurpose room.
Outside of the residence, the grounds have been re-landscaped as a pedestrian plaza with benches and newly planted trees.
On the east side of the building, there are plans for a terrace area including a sloped lawn and patio. The glass-paneled first floor will serve as the promenade’s light source at night.
“The idea is that any student can come here to hang out, study and see their friends,” Gorgati said. “There was a very purposeful strategy to get students to come together and be part of the Georgetown experience.”
A guarded front desk will separate students from the residential areas of the building and another lounge area exclusively for residents. The first floor will also hold a large bike storage area.
The majority of rooms in the NET will be two-bedroom suites for four residents. Every suite will have a full bathroom with two sinks, as well as large storage closets and windows for natural light.
Additionally, there will be a mix of singles and three-bedroom suites with more bathroom access. The building is fully accessible and will forgo keys in favor of GOCards.
The residence’s only laundry room will be located on the second floor, and each floor will have its own lounge, television and kitchen. Residents will have access to a prayer room on the eighth floor.
The basement of the building is joined with an access tunnel to a loading dock, where garbage will be disposed.
One of the NET’s most attractive features is a full view of Washington, D.C. from the seventh floor terrace and the eighth floor, where students can see the Potomac River, the Washington Monument and other landmarks.
Other vistas can be found from the north end of the building, where a tower of student lounges looks out over Georgetown’s campus.
“It embraces the plaza, and you have these very nice views of Red Square,” Gorgati said. “As you go up, you see all the steeples and towers of campus. From the seventh and eighth floors, its really superb.”
Gorgati and Sasaki Associates initiated the dorm’s design process in mid-2013, and continued throughout 2014.
According to Walcott, the next step for the construction is to make the building watertight by December. Following that milestone, the brick, stone and metal on the outside of the building will be built up through March.
Scaffolding is expected to come down in April, followed by re-grading and final paving scheduled for June.
“As I see … this new place of beautiful views and open spaces and welcoming places for students to live, I’m very enthused for the future of our students and our campus,” Olson said.
Secretary of Campus Planning Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) said he is pleased with the progress of the building and the student involvement that has gone into the planning process.
“Administrators have made a meaningful effort to engage students in the building’s design and construction processes, and we should see the positive results of that,” Goldstein wrote in an email to THE HOYA. “As we’ve seen from the opening of the Former Jesuit Residence, meaningful collaboration and thoughtful long-term planning can yield great results.”

The Georgetown University Law Center partnered with Black Girls CODE and the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality to host more than 50 girls from the Washington, D.C. area at its “Build a Webpage in a Day” event on Aug. 22.
Girls aged 7 to 17 were tasked with writing and creating code on computers provided GULC and Black Girls CODE, while their parents learned ways to help their daughters thrive in the computer science field at the event held at the law center.
“I think it was a wonderful success,” Center on Poverty and Inequality Executive Director Rebecca Epstein said.
Planning began after a January conference in association with the White House emphasized increasing marginalized girls’ access to careers in science, technology, engineering and math.
Two White House advisors attended the “Build a Webpage in a Day” event and encouraged the girls to stay in the field of computer science. Roy Austin, from the White House’s Domestic Policy Council, and Kimberlyn Leary, an advisor to the White House Council on Women and Girls, also communicated the president’s appreciation of their interest in the computer science field.
“Two White House officials stood up in front of all these girls and their parents and said, ‘ [President Obama] supports what you’re doing,’” Epstein said. “That’s an incredible message for these girls to get.”
Additionally, Obama’s administration invited girls in attendance at the law center to the White House for an upcoming Champions of Change conference.
“What we know is when we give outstanding young people like this a chance, they can succeed,” Obama said in June. “They just need a little bit of help.”
The event also served as the launch for the D.C. chapter of San Francisco-based Black Girls CODE, an organization that helps minority girls begin to pursue careers in STEM fields. Since its 2011 founding, the organization has expanded to locations across seven states and to one international location in Johannesburg, South Africa,.
“When [Black Girls CODE] contacted us … I really jumped at the opportunity,” Epstein said. “We welcomed the chance to give directly back to the community.”
Black Girls CODE Founder and Executive Director Kimberly Bryant said she is optimistic about expanding to the D.C. area.
“We’re very happy with how [the event] was and how the expansion to the District has gone for us overall,” Bryant said. “I’m really happy that we’re in D.C.”
Bryant also stressed that Black Girls CODE is a way for young minority women, who are underrepresented in the field of computer science, to bridge the workplace gap.
“There’s only about three percent of African-American women that graduate with a bachelor’s degree in computer science,” Bryant said. “That number translates directly into what we see in the workplace.”
Epstein agreed, and added that one of the Center on Poverty and Inequality’s main goals is to prepare underprivileged citizens for future careers. She said events like this are needed to increase awareness and interest for females in the computer science field.
“At the Center on Poverty, one of the issue areas we focus on is the development of workplace skills,” Epstein said. “We were grateful for the opportunity to help highlight the assets that girls of color can bring to the field if it were more diverse.”
Bryant said that certain moments during the event stood out to her, specifically. The first was at the end of the day, when the girls presented their code to their parents, and the second was in the morning, when parents learned about STEM’s influence on the lives of their children.
“There’s some very significant magic that takes place in those settings,” Bryant said. “It’s always a very celebratory event for everyone.”
Following the success of “Build a Webpage in a Day,” Epstein and Bryant agreed on possibly collaborating again to continue to raise awareness for underrepresented demographics in STEM fields.
“We’re always open to considering ways in which to highlight the needs and the assets of girls of color,” Epstein said. “We would welcome the opportunity to do more events in the future.”
