Three tickets launched their campaigns and a fourth confirmed its candidacy for the Georgetown University Student Association 2019 executive election early Friday morning, with candidates calling for greater campus inclusivity and stressing realistic goals.  
The four announced tickets are: Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Aleida Olvera (COL ’20); Nicki Gray (NHS ’20) and Sam Appel (COL ’20); Sina Nemazi (COL ’21) and Roya Wolfe (SFS ’21); Ryan Zuccala (MSB ’20) and John Dolan (MSB ’20). All four tickets are officially registered to run, co-chair of the GUSA Election Commission Grant Castle (SFS ’21) said.
Typical to the start of every GUSA executive election season, Francis-Olvera, Gray-Appel and Nemazi-Wolfe arrived in Red Square with their campaign staff and posters just after midnight to mark the official start of their campaign season.
While not present alongside the three tickets in Red Square, Zuccala and Dolan are confirmed to have entered the race. The pair are both members of the Georgetown men’s lightweight rowing team. 
The election is set for Friday, Feb. 8. Additional tickets are permitted to enter the race if they collect and submit 100 student signatures to the GUSA Election Commission by Monday, Jan. 28.
Francis and Olvera
With rap music playing from a speaker and a lit candle, Francis and Olvera emerged from the Intercultural Center to Red Square, holding their campaign poster and leading a group of supporters behind them.
If elected, the candidates will prioritize achievable targets, according to Francis. 
“We’re really big on trying to do things that we really can accomplish,” Francis said in an interview with The Hoya. “We don’t want to just give empty promises; we want to actually make sure we can actually have attainable goals and make tangible change at the university during our tenure.”
The pair intends to run a platform based on four main policy themes — transparency, reform, accessibility and progress — which will guide their approach to tackling student issues, according to Olvera.
“We want to push the university to bring about these four key points, and our platform is basically a scaffold from there,” Olvera said. 
Francis is a student office assistant at the Georgetown University department of African American studies and serves as a tour guide for Blue and Gray Tour Guide Society. Olvera serves as co-director for Georgetown University’s inaugural hackathon Hoya Hacks, is the technology director of Georgetown Radio and is a Georgetown Community Scholar.
Though neither has any previous GUSA experience, the pair are confident they can use student government as a platform to elevate the voices of students who may otherwise feel excluded.
“I know people are really competitive about this but me and Norman, we’re really, like, relaxed, chill and laid-back people; it’s kind of us just trying to see if maybe we can have our voice heard because we haven’t been a part of these big, established organizations like this,” Olvera said. “We’ve never had this certain type of position, so we’re trying to see what kind of impact we can make as students who don’t have that much experience through this opportunity.”
Gray and Appel 
Followed by a cheering crowd of campaign staff, Gray and Appel carried their banner out of the ICC surrounded by supporters calling their names.
The candidates spoke about their distinct experiences in different on-campus groups and their campaign’s intended emphasis on underrepresented student voices.
Gray, who has not previously been involved in GUSA, said her other experiences on campus give her an educated perspective on student issues. 
“I’ve seen campus from a lot of different angles: as an RA, as a member of GERMS and as a member of a lot of different cultural and other student organizations,” Gray said. “But I recognize that my experience isn’t exhaustive. My vision for Georgetown is a home that promotes the safety, comfort, curiosity, creativity, spirit and overall well-being of all of its members, all of the members of its community.”
Gray underscored the value of her running mate’s previous positions and work in GUSA.
“Sam has a lot of experience inside of student government and has been an amazing, outspoken advocate for students and community members who often go unheard in policy discussions,” Gray said.
Gray currently serves as the director of personnel for Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service and as the standards chair for Delta Phi Epsilon professional foreign service sorority. Appel serves as a GUSA senator representing the class of 2020 and was corresponding secretary for the Georgetown Philodemic Society in fall 2018.
The pair also voiced their excitement for the opportunity to hear and learn both from their fellow candidates and the larger Georgetown community.
“I’m honestly so excited to get to know all the other tickets, all the other candidates and what they stand for,” Gray said. “But also getting to know the rest of the students on this campus, because there are just so many students who have so many different backgrounds and experiences and important issues that they want to address.”
Nemazi and Wolfe
Nemazi and Wolfe, along with campaign staffers, were the first ones to arrive in Red Square. The candidates announced a platform focused on increasing student awareness on issues of mental health, women’s empowerment and environmental sustainability. 
The pair seeks to represent the entire Georgetown community, pursuing initiatives they hope will highlight issues not traditionally addressed by university administrators.
“Our slogan is ‘run for all’ and we really do stand by that,” Wolfe said in an interview with The Hoya. “Our fear is inaction and ignorance and that’s what we want to change.”
Nemazi currently serves as GUSA’s dining policy chair and also as the director of communications for the Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service’s  student-run online publication, On the Record. Wolfe works for Uncommon Grounds, a coffee shop owned by Students of Georgetown, Inc., commonly known as The Corp, and was a former member of the Georgetown women’s club ultimate frisbee team. 
Nemazi plans to draw on his GUSA experience advocating for improved on-campus dining quality, efficiency and affordability.
“I basically had a couple things I wanted to do and that’s increasing efficiency, bringing halal and increasing time for, like, dining,” Nemazi said. “I did that and I achieved that, so that’s what I’m bringing to this campaign.”
Unlike her running mate, Wolfe does not have experience working with GUSA, but she looks forward to serving the student body. 
“I’m excited to meet the other people running in the race,” Wolfe said. “I’ve met a couple of the candidates and I’ve never done anything like this before. I did student council in high school but not here at Georgetown so I am excited to see what GUSA holds and see where we can help.”
GUSA in Review
This year’s election comes in the wake of a series of GUSA executive resignations last fall.
On Sept. 11, former vice president Naba Rahman (SFS ’19) and 10 other executive cabinet members resigned effective Sept. 14, to put pressure on then-GUSA president Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) to resign amid sexual assault allegations against him. Nair resigned later that morning. After an emergency GUSA senate meeting that night, senators demanded all of the resignations be upheld. Rahman and the remaining cabinet members officially resigned Sept. 13.
Per GUSA bylaws, former GUSA senate transition chair Juan Martinez (SFS ’20) became president Sept. 16 as a result of vacancies in the roles of vice president, chief of staff, and speaker and vice speaker of the senate, the latter two of which had not yet been filled. Martinez nominated Kenna Chick (SFS ’20) as his vice president Oct. 1 and the GUSA senate confirmed her nomination Oct. 2.
Candidates are barred from spending more than $300 on their campaigns. All tickets are required by the GUSA Election commission, an independent body of undergraduate students who fairly administer all student government races, to submit receipts of all campaign expenses by midnight on election day. Last year’s executive election results were delayed after the use of Snapchat filters was not included in a submission of Nair and Rahman’s campaign finance receipts. However, the election commission concluded that the pair did not exceed the $300 spending limit.
On election day, students can vote on the student organization portal HoyaLink or at a polling station operated by the GUSA Election Commission, expected to be in Red Square or the Leavey Center.
The debates for vice presidential and presidential candidates will be held Thursday, Jan. 31, at 7 p.m. in room 115 of the ICC and Tuesday, Feb. 5, at 8 p.m. in the Healey Family Student Center Great Room.

The Georgetown community can now review the draft of the university’s comment to the U.S. Department of Education regarding proposed Title IX reforms. Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny shared the document in a Wednesday email and welcomed student feedback by Sunday, Jan. 27 through an anonymous form.
The university’s 10-page draft comment includes criticism of the Department of Education’s proposed definitions of the terms “sexual harassment” and “formal complaint.” The administration also argued against the proposal for requiring cross-examination of all parties and witnesses in Title IX cases, among other critiques.
University spokesperson Matt Hill expressed the administration’s gratitude for the Georgetown community’s input into the draft comment.
“We are very pleased with the University’s comment, which is a product of the collaboration and insight of our entire community,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Through the listening sessions, online feedback forms, and the STAIV town hall, our community provided valuable perspectives, insights, and information.”
After the Department of Education released proposed changes to Title IX regulations last November, the university held 10 feedback sessions in December open to Georgetown students, faculty and staff. Last week, campus student group Students Taking Action Against Interpersonal Violence held a town hall as a forum for students to voice concerns about the changes directly to school administrators.
Community members can also submit their own comments directly to the Department of Education until Jan. 30, a deadline that was extended from Jan. 28 last week following issues with the department’s website.
Georgetown’s sexual assault and misconduct climate survey, administered in January and February 2016, found that 31 percent of female undergraduates and 10.8 percent of male undergraduates had experienced nonconsensual sexual contact since entering Georgetown; nearly half of all students and more than three-quarters of all female students had experienced sexual harassment.
The university feedback sessions aimed to provide students, faculty and staff with an opportunity to share their views on the new policies before the university drafted its official comment. Kilkenny sent out a document to the Georgetown community on Jan 14 summarizing the feedback from the feedback sessions.
More than 370 participants made comments or asked questions at those feedback sessions. Attendees focused their concerns on several issues that the university highlighted in its draft comment, including the legal definition of sexual misconduct, the role of advisers at hearing sessions and the standard of proof in cases of sexual harassment and assault.
Narrow Definition of Sexual Misconduct
Participants in the feedback sessions were particularly concerned with the proposed redefinition of sexual misconduct. More than 70 participants expressed concerns about the consequences of the proposed stringent definitions that could limit what qualifies as sexual harassment.
The Department of Education Title IX proposal would change the definition of sexual misconduct from behavior that is “severe or pervasive” to “severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive.” Individuals at feedback session worried that some behaviors, such as stalking and relationship violence, would not meet the new standard for sexual misconduct and that new rules would deprive victims of recourse through Title IX processes.
The university has echoed those concerns in the draft of comments to the Department of Education and suggested the department maintain the “severe or pervasive” guidelines.
Additionally, 32 participants at feedback sessions commented on the proposed change in jurisdictional scope for universities with regard to Title IX. Under the proposed guidelines, sexual misconduct that takes place off campus, but may still contribute to a hostile environment on campus, will not be subject to Title IX rules. Individuals expressed concern that graduate students, students living off campus or students in study abroad programs would not have access to Title IX resources.
Students in the Sexual Assault Peer Educators program believe that the new definition of sexual misconduct would create an additional barrier for survivors seeking justice.
“This new definition would challenge the work that we have been doing by allowing perpetrators to go free of consequence through obvious loopholes,” SAPE wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We acknowledge all sexual misconduct as significant and worthy of recognition. We want to stop sexual misconduct altogether, rather than waiting until it becomes “severe enough” for an outsider’s judgment.”
STAIV activists expressed similar worries about the narrower definition of sexual misconduct and implications for off-campus cases in a statement to The Hoya.
“The new definition of sexual misconduct that requires behavior to be ‘severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive’ makes investigating perpetrators more difficult and erases violence that occurs,” STAIV wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Because many Georgetown students study abroad or live in townhouses off-campus, the fact that the new Title IX policy does not include off-campus assaults is also worrying.”
The university’s draft urged Department of Education officials to interpret Title IX language so that off-campus programs or activities not directly sponsored by the university remain within the university’s jurisdiction.
Roles of Advisers and Cross-Examination
The Trump administration’s proposal is also set to change the nature of Title IX hearings and proceedings. Under the current hearing process, questions are submitted in advance to a neutral panel, which then deliberates on which questions to ask and how to frame them. New rules would require live hearings and cross-examination of complainants and respondents. These changes would also expand the roles of advisers to both complainants and respondents. Advisers do not serve as an attorney but can provide legal counsel.
Thirty participants at the university’s feedback sessions did not support live hearings, with some expressing the concern that cross-examination could retraumatize victims of sexual misconduct. Several attendees instead advocated for the current
questioning system.
STAIV argued cross-examination and the obligation to file a formal complaint would “further complicates the process and will discourage reporting.”
SAPE agreed that cross-examination would discourage reporting and highlighted the potential trauma that live questioning may impose on survivors.
“Live cross-examination from the accused would be extremely traumatic for survivors, and unnecessary,” SAPE wrote. “We need to provide a safe space where survivors feel comfortable reporting their experiences, and this would do the opposite.”
The university echoed these concerns in its draft comment to the Department of Education, underscoring the challenge of filing a formal misconduct complaint.
“We already know that the majority of students who experience sexual misconduct never proceed with a formal complaint,” the comment reads. “There is little doubt that the specter of being cross-examined by a trained criminal defense attorney during a school’s grievance procedure would drive down the number of students seeking redress through formal processes even further. ”
Stringent Standard of Proof
Under former President Barack Obama, the Department of Education reinterpreted Title IX as granting authority to the federal government to dictate adjudication procedures for sexual assault allegations in federally funded educational institutions in a guidance document known as the “Dear Colleague” letter.
The letter established the standard of proof for cases of sexual harassment at universities as a “preponderance of evidence,” the lowest possible standard. Under the Trump administration proposals, however, educational institutions would apply the more stringent “clear and convincing” standard to cases of sexual harassment.
Forty participants at Georgetown feedback sessions voiced opposition to the proposed change, with the majority of the group in favor of the Obama-era standard. Raising the standard of proof would place a larger burden on the survivor in a proceeding, according to Georgetown’s notes about the feedback session.
The university’s draft comment shared the concerns of feedback session participants, supporting the preponderance of evidence standard and opposing proposals that may encourage a more stringent standard.
“Sexual misconduct cases often involve two people with little extrinsic evidence, which is why many institutions opt to use preponderance of the evidence,” the draft comment reads. “Georgetown uses the preponderance of the evidence standard for sexual misconduct cases and the data show that this standard does not unfairly skew findings in favor of the complainant or respondent.”
Though the university draft comment will be submitted by Jan. 30, the university seeks to extend student participation throughout the rest of the semester through a second sexual assault and misconduct climate survey that will begin Feb. 1.
“It was powerful to see the widespread engagement and dedication to preventing and addressing sexual assault from hundreds of Georgetown community members, and we hope the community remains engaged by encouraging students to participate in the University’s second campus climate survey between February 1 and March 1,” Hill wrote. “This survey is another opportunity for students to provide valuable insights that will shape our continued work on this issue.”

GU Fossil Free, a campus student group advocating for Georgetown University to adopt socially responsible investment policies, submitted a proposal Jan. 16 calling for Georgetown to completely divest its $1.5 billion endowment fund from all fossil fuel energy companies.
The proposal calls on the university to cease all new investments in fossil fuels, with the goal of completely divesting from fossil fuel companies in 2024.
Investing in fossil fuel violates Georgetown’s Socially Responsible Investment policy passed in 2017, according to Samantha Panchèvre (SFS ’19), a member of GUFF.
“With climate change, our argument is that it’s not a political concept,” Panchèvre said. “It’s happening to everyone, it’s not controversial and right now we have money that is directly supporting climate change. We want our degrees to be fossil free.”
GUFF has previously successfully petitioned the university to alter its investment practices. In November 2017, the group submitted a proposal for the university to divest from tar sands, which the university accepted after  a meeting of the board of directors in June 2018. GUFF also petitioned the university to divest from fossil fuels in 2012. The 2012 petition has garnered over 3,000 signatures, including those of 176 faculty members.
While the university has removed all investments in coal and tar sands, which consist of a mixture of sand, clay, water and bitumen, from its endowment, the proposal says full divestment of fossil fuel energy companies would build upon initiatives the university has already started.
“Divestment from all fossil fuels would give Georgetown more credibility as the University pursues other sustainability projects, including the compost.
pilot program in Leo’s Dining Hall, the planning effort for more sustainable campus waste systems, and the ambition to source more of the campus’s energy from renewable resources,” the petition reads.
The proposal is the latest on-campus push for the university to embrace sustainable investment practices. It comes as students nationwide are petitioning their universities to remove any investments in companies producing carbon-based energy from their endowments. Several campuses have committed to fully divest from fossil fuels, including Pitzer College in California and Seattle University in Washington, the first Jesuit institution to commit to full divestment.
The university has officially recognized the proposal, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill.
“Georgetown University takes seriously matters related to social responsibility and its investments,” Hill wrote in a statement to The Hoya.
The university’s Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, which is made up of students, administrators and faculty, reviews proposals relating to the SRI and is set to consider GUFF’s proposal at its next meeting Feb. 24, according to Hill. 
Georgetown’s 2017 SRI Policy ensures that the university’s investments fall in line with its commitment to stewardship for the planet and social justice, among other Jesuit values. The policy instructs Georgetown to avoid investments in companies whose practices have significantly harmful effects on the environment.
The university’s current practices do not match both its previous policies and Jesuit values, the Jan. 17 divestment proposal reads.
“The fossil fuel industry’s negative environmental, social, and financial impacts violate Georgetown’s Socially Responsible Investing policy, which warrant its full divestment,” the proposal reads. “In doing so, the University would demonstrate its commitment once again to our Jesuit values and to our moral and environmental leadership.” 
Georgetown would become the second Jesuit university to divest fully from fossil fuels and would become the first institution in the Consortium on Financing Higher Education, a group of 35 colleges committed to meeting the full demonstrated financial need of students, to fully divest from fossil fuels. COFHE universities include Harvard, MIT, Stanford and Yale, among others. 
The proposal specifically cites the Catholic Divestment Network, an association of student campaigns at Catholic institutions that pushes for the exclusion of fossil fuel investments from endowments. The CDN aims to connect campaigns from Catholic universities working on similar initiatives promoting sustainability
Panchèvre has high hopes for GUFF’s environmentally friendly initiatives.
“I hope that Georgetown fully divests from fossil fuels, and that our campaign transforms more into an endowment transparency campaign, which attempts to bridge the gap between students and higher level administration, and advocates for clean energy investments,” Panchevre said.

Security footage of Victor Page, a former Georgetown University basketball player, assaulting and attempting to rape his girlfriend’s 17 year-old daughter before neighbors intervened surfaced on TMZ on Jan. 19. 
Page was committed to the Prince George’s County Correctional Center on Jan. 5 on a charge of attempted first-degree rape. He is awaiting a hearing Feb. 1, according to TMZ Sports. 
The incident occurred Dec. 30, while Page was still on parole for a 10-year sentence he had received for a 2013 second-degree assault. The victim’s mother reported the incident to Page’s parole officer, according to Fox 5. Court documents allege that the victim attempted to escape but was recaptured by Page outside of the victim’s home in Camp Springs, Md., before neighbors intervened. 
Georgetown Survivors, a student group that advocates and provides supports for survivors of sexual assault on campus, condemned Page’s actions in a statement to The Hoya.
“We are glad that justice is being pursued and hope that the victim is able to access the resources she needs to heal,” Georgetown Survivors wrote. “It is fortunate that the incident was filmed—video is often one of the only forms of evidence considered conclusive enough to get justice for the survivor.” 
Page was recruited and played for the Georgetown men’s basketball team from 1995 to 1997 and left the university without graduating, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill. Page averaged 22.7 points as the Big East’s leading scorer and an all-conference performer in his 1997-98 sophomore season, coached by John Thompson Jr. and playing alongside future NBA player Allen Iverson. 
Page grew up in the District and moved between high schools, eventually playing for McKinley Technology High School. In his senior year he was convicted of gun and drug infractions after he pleaded guilty to charges of cocaine possession. Page was sentenced to 90 days in jail. 
Although Page pursued basketball after leaving Georgetown, he never played in the NBA. Page entered the NBA draft but remained undrafted before playing in the Continental Basketball Association for several seasons with the Sioux Falls Skyforce before he was dismissed over issues with his work ethic.
Page caught public attention again in 2003 when he was shot three times while sitting in his car in Southeast D.C. He was transported to the hospital by helicopter and arrived there in critical condition, but survived with an injury to his right eye, on which he now wears a patch. 
The official Georgetown men’s basketball Twitter account, @GeorgetownHoops, tweeted a throwback in remembrance of Page’s time as a Hoya in early 2018, despite his still being on parole for his 2013 assault. 
“All-American. 1st Team All BIG EAST. BIG EAST Tournament MVP. Respect, Victor Page!” the tweet reads. 
Though Page has previous convictions, none of these occurred during the time that he spent at the university before he decided to leave, according to Hill. 
“Georgetown University takes our responsibility to prevent and address sexual assault and misconduct very seriously,” Hill wrote. “Student-athletes participate in extensive training on preventing sexual misconduct, hazing, and other issues.” 
While Page’s actions prove deeply disappointing, Georgetown students should not forget the prevalence of sexual assault at the university, Georgetown Survivors said.
“While it is deeply upsetting that Page acted as he did, he is not, by far, the only perpetrator of sexual assault or misconduct affiliated with Georgetown,” Georgetown Survivors wrote. “We hope that all Hoyas, regardless of identify or background, act with humanity or otherwise are held accountable to their actions — even if incidents are not caught on film.

Molly McKew, a recently hired adjunct professor teaching a course on Russian disinformation campaigns for the School of Foreign Service, has faced criticism from colleagues and news outlets for her former status as a foreign lobbyist.
McKew, who holds a masters degree in Russian and Post-Soviet Studies and has served as an advisor to political parties in Georgia and Moldova, is teaching her first course at Georgetown this semester. The course, entitled “Russian Hybrid Warfare,” focuses on the history of Russian ideology and information warfare. McKew also currently serves as the CEO of Fianna Strategies, a consulting firm.
Greg Afinogenov, an assistant professor of Imperial Russian History at Georgetown, criticized the university’s hiring of McKew. In a series of tweets, Afinogenov wrote that McKew’s history as a foreign lobbyist posed several conflicts of interest to her role as a professor.
“A student who takes her class will not know which of her ideas are truth, which are credible suppositions, and which are complete fabrications,” Afinogenov wrote in a Jan. 10 tweet.
McKew has written articles for several publications, including Politico and The Washington Post, and has also served as a commentator for TV and radio shows such as Frontline.
McKew’s writings are not academic in nature and do not qualify her as a scholar or an expert, Afinogenov wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“McKew is an example of exactly the kind of journalist whose articles should be corrected by scholars: the claims she makes are outlandish, escalationist, and rooted in a history of working for foreign governments with an interest in influencing public debate in the United States,” @Afinogenov wrote.
McKew stated that her critics are furthering an effort to discredit her and the threat of Russian hybrid warfare. Her history as an advisory to political leaders in Moldova and Georgia only made her more qualified for the position at the university, she wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“The idea that being a ‘foreign agent’ disqualifies my experience ignores that what I know about how the Kremlin attacks its opponents comes from working as an advisor to countries under attack,” McKew wrote.
McKew is respected by many within her field, which is what led to the university’s initial contact with her, Vice Dean of the School of Foreign Service Daniel Byman said in an interview with The Hoya.
“She came to us well-recommended from a number of individuals in the national security committee, and that was the kind of basis for reaching out to her,” Byman said.
The university hired McKew in response to Russia’s growing prominence in international relations following its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to Byman.
U.S. intelligence agencies following have since determined that the Kremlin likely engaged in information warfare to sow distrust and support President Donald Trump’s campaign.
McKew plans to use her work in countries previously attacked by Russian hybrid warfare to explore how the United States can best respond to interference in its elections, according to her course’s description.
Criticism for McKew has not stopped with Afinogenov’s tweets, as other media outlets reported and similarly cast doubt over McKew’s qualifications for her position at Georgetown.
Leonid Bershidsky, a columnist for Bloomberg, also questioned McKew’s credibility on Russian disinformation campaigns, arguing that McKew, among many other American experts, replaces nuanced arguments with those based on simplified Cold War models.
Afinogenov’s tweets criticizing McKew were referenced in an article on RT, a Russian state-backed news outlet charged by the Columbia Journalism Review as acting as a propaganda. 
Afinogenov wrote that he was disappointed to see his tweets on RT.
“This was not my intent; I do not endorse propaganda channels like RT and was not invited to comment on the article that quoted my tweets,” Afinogenov wrote.
McKew has come under criticism from RT before for “anti-Russian rhetoric.”
RT targeting McKew is evidence of the her qualifications, Joel Harding, a consultant for information operations and cyber warfare, wrote in a Jan. 12 blog post.
“If RT notices you and writes a smear piece on you, that means you’ve made it,” Harding wrote. 
Those currently attacking the credentials of McKew, who has twice testified in front of Congress on Russian interference in the 2016 election, are actually aiding Russian disinformation campaigns, Harding wrote.
“None of these so-called experts have the bona fides she does against Russian propaganda and disinformation programs, yet they seemingly gleefully contribute to Russia’s efforts to undermine US counter-Russian disinformation efforts by attacking her.”

McKew is a clown. The prestige of Georgetown will only deteriorate with her employment.

Comedians Jim Gaffigan (MSB ’88), Mike Birbiglia (COL ’00) and John Mulaney (COL ’04) raised $1 million at a New York City comedy fundraiser for the Georgetown Scholars Program to benefit low-income and first-generation students at Georgetown.
Gaffigan, Birbiglia and Mulaney performed for the audience at the sold-out event at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Jan. 14. The three prominent stand-up comedians have all received critical acclaim for many of their projects, including Mulaney’s Netflix show “Big Mouth,” Birbiglia’s film “Sleepwalk With Me” and Gaffigan’s comedy album “Jim Gaffigan: Mr. Universe.”
Gaffigan wanted to organize an event that was memorable and enjoyable for the audience while at the same time raising funds for a good cause, according to Emily Chen Carrera (MSB ’88), a longtime friend of Gaffigan’s who helped organize the event. Gaffigan’s wife and fellow comedian Jeannie Gaffigan, Chair of the GSP advisory board Michelle Mauboussin (MSB ’86) and fellow planning committee members helped Chen Carrera organize the event.
To make the event more meaningful and significant, Gaffigan reached out to fellow alumni Mulaney and Birbiglia, Chen Carrera said in an interview with The Hoya.
“We were able to combine backgrounds in finance, fundraising and event planning, and Jim’s expertise in putting on an amazing show and to orchestrate something as special as we had last Monday night,” Chen Carrera said.
The money raised went to GSP, which provides support for college students from low-income socio-economic backgrounds. GSP provides students a support system designed to ease their transitions to elite universities, through its mentorship, career advising and community building programs.
The event not only raised money for GSP, but also raised the program’s profile, Mauboussin said in an interview with The Hoya.
“It was a very uplifting event, and it really brought this program for first-generation students to a more national level, mainly because the comedians have such a wide network of followers,” Mauboussin said.
Some of the money raised will go toward funding microgrants that students in the program can apply for. These small grants can be used to cover any unexpected or emergency expenses that students might accrue, Mauboussin said.
This was not Gaffigan’s first time raising money for GSP. Last September, he performed at a sold-out show in Chicago to raise money for the program. Over 300 Georgetown alumni and friends attended that performance, helping raise almost $25,000.
While at Georgetown, Mulaney and Birbiglia both pursued comedy through the Georgetown Improv Association. Birbiglia won the “Funniest Person on Campus” competition his sophomore year, the first time he had been on stage performing comedy. Gaffigan, on the other hand, played varsity football during his time on at Georgetown, moving to New York City after graduating to pursue a career of comedy.
In addition to fundraising for GSP, the event also brought together members of the Georgetown community and GSP alumni who do not always have the chances to reunite in such organized settings, Maubossin said. 
“It was such a community-building event,” Mauboussin said. “There was a lot of positive energy in the room, and it made everyone feel great and excited about being a Hoya.”

Shouldn’t they do this show in D.C.?  They’d sell out the Capital One Arena.

The acceptance of the legalization of abortion stems from materialist culture, which prioritizes personal convenience over the lives of others, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, said in a keynote at the 20th annual Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life on Jan. 19.
The O’Connor Conference, the largest collegiate pro-life conference in the United States, was founded by Georgetown students in 2000 to promote intellectual discourse on the sacredness of human life both within and beyond the Georgetown student body, according to the conference website. The conference is named after the late Cardinal John O’Connor (GRD ’70), who dedicated his life to advocacy for the preservation of human life, and held annually on Georgetown’s campus.
This year’s conference examined “Pro-Life Priorities: Advancing a Culture of Life.” Five anti-abortion advocates spoke on a panel: author and professor Steven Aden, chief legal office and general counsel at Americans United for Life; Daniel Williams, U.S. religion and politics historian; Jeanne Mancini, president of annual anti-abortion rally March for Life; Catherine Hadro, Catholic television host and producer; and Catholic theologian George Weigel. 
Members of H*yas for Choice, an unrecognized pro-reproductive rights student group on campus, carried signs and protested outside the morning of the conference in Healy Circle.
Anti-abortion advocates have already won the argument on abortion, according to Weigel; the next step is convincing those who are pro-reproductive rights to change their beliefs.
“We’ve won the argument for the last 40 years,” Weigel said. “We’ve won the scientific argument. We’ve won the political theory argument, and I think we’ve won the moral argument. What we haven’t won sufficiently is hearts.”
The anti-abortion stance is an inherently Christian value, according to Aden.
“Only a Christian, in my view, can do that,” Aden said. “Only a Christian can show compassion and care, not just to the mothers and babies, but to those who are trapped in the abortion industry.”
Dolan commended those in attendance, both students of Georgetown and those who had come from outside of the university.
“It’s humbling to be with you, especially you young people, who I claim to be genuine confessors of the faith, courageous apostles who year after year in the capital of the nation built to serve a republic, to serve a nation founded on certain inalienable rights, with that, the right to life put first,” Dolan said.
Throughout the week leading up to the conference, HFC shared posts on its Facebook and Instagram pages protesting the conference because of the speakers’ views on marginalized communities and the Catholic Church’s abuse crisis.
O’Connor has faced criticism for his repeated condemnation of the LGBTQ community. He supported the prohibition of LGBTQ Catholics from the property of the Brooklyn Diocese and opposed the 1986 passage of a New York City bill that banned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, according to The New York Times. O’Connor also attempted to block AIDS education and prevention programs in New York at the height of the AIDS epidemic, which disproportionately affected the LGBTQ community.
Dolan moved $57 million off the archdiocesan books into a cemetery trust fund in an attempt to shield church finances from damage suits by victims of childhood sexual abuse, according to The New York Times. In 2003, Dolan authorized payments of as much as $20,000 to sexually abusive priests as an incentive to ensure they left the ministry quietly.
Members of HFC and the larger Georgetown community gathered to protest in Healy Circle early Saturday morning. More than 30 people joined in flyering, carrying signs and chanting protests against the speakers and namesake of the conference.
“Dolan protects child rapists; he is not welcome on our campus,” the protestors chanted. “His name is not a source of pride; O’Connor watched as queer folks died.”
HFC protests the conference annually to provide an opposing viewpoint to the opinions perpetuated by the speakers, according to Elianna Schiffrik (SFS ’21), HFC co-director of communications.
“Our goal for the protest was to make our disapproval of the conference and its various speakers known, and make it clear to Georgetown administrators and attendees that the conference does not represent our Georgetown community,” Schiffrik said in an interview with The Hoya.
Schiffrik also published a viewpoint in The Hoya on Jan. 16 encouraging Georgetown students to protest the conference.
The conference was sponsored by the Office of the President, the Office of the Provost, the Catholic Chaplaincy at Georgetown, the College of Nursing and Health Sciences, the Office of Public Affairs, the Georgetown University Law Center and the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service.

Investments in housing can address Washington, D.C.’s affordability issues as the city’s population booms, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said at a Jan. 22 panel of mayors in Lohrfink Auditorium.
The third annual “Georgetown Mayors Forum” featured Bowser; Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio; and Mayor Elizabeth Kautz of Burnsville, Minn., in a panel about innovation, infrastructure and inclusion.
The Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service hosted the event in collaboration with the Georgetown University Global Cities Initiative with Sheila Foster, a featured professor of law and public policy, as the moderator.
Despite representing cities ranging from 60,000 to over 600,000 in population, the mayors agreed that joint efforts between community members and local governments are important in resolving concerns, according to Kautz.
“All of us have the same issues, they’re just in different degrees,” Kautz said. “The thing that you have to do is that you do have to talk to people, whether it’s a city my size, Mayor Bowser’s, or Mayor Whaley’s, it’s all about how you approach those tasks intentionally.”
Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, locally elected nonpartisan bodies that advise the District government on issues affecting neighborhoods, provide a way for members of D.C. communities to engage with the local government. The effectiveness of the ANCs relies on high engagement and the support of the D.C. government, according to Bowser.
“I value the input of the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and I certainly think they are called on to do more and we are called on to give them the tools they need to be effective,” Bowser said.
Two Georgetown students, Matias Burdman (COL ’21) and Anna Landre (SFS ’21), were recently elected to ANC 2E, which oversees Georgetown University, Burleith, Hillandale and Georgetown.
The ANC system can take away from what is best for D.C. as a whole, however, because at times each individual commissioner’s focus is on their own district, Bowser said.
“The one hole you can encounter with ANC commissioners is that people are micro-parochial, not just on a ward level, but on a Single Member District, 2000-person level,” Bowser said. “Sometimes the benefits that they may negotiate for a particular development don’t contribute to bigger city issues.”
Partnerships between local governments and private sectors can lead to improvements in affordable housing, according to Kautz. When Burnsville, Minn., turned over the land of a neighborhood with high crime rates to a housing development company on the condition that 20 percent of the housing was made affordable, crime in the area shrank, according to Kautz.
“This was about bringing people together, the property owners as well as all of the developers, and asking the question ‘What do we want our city to look like?’” Kautz said. “For me, it was about creating an urban center, creating a pedestrian-friendly environment, as well as making sure that everyone is welcomed.”
As costs of living and housing increase in D.C., low-income black families are being pushed out of their homes, according to The Washington Post. This summer, residents of D.C. filed a class action suit against the District for discriminatory housing policies. The plaintiffs accused the city for supporting gentrification that disproportionately hurts communities of color.
The issue of limited affordable housing should not only be addressed by the D.C. government, but also at the neighborhood level, according to Bowser.
“We want to encourage growth and attract people and good jobs, but it does make everything so much more expensive, and housing is the key,” Bowser said. “I’ve challenged our whole city to think even bigger and we’re asking everyone to be a part of the solution by adopting goals for each neighborhood.”
Engaging community organizations with local government also helped address the opioid crisis in Dayton, according to Whaley. The alignment with local community organizations led to a 50 percent drop in fatal overdoses over a year, according to The New York Times.
“We aligned the entire community, over 60 different organizations came to the table and said we’ve got to do whatever we can to really deal with the issue of addiction like the disease that it is,” Whaley said. “The collective-impact model is something that I think is the best model for all sorts of issues, from education to addiction issues.”

Undergraduate tuition to attend Georgetown University for the 2019-20 academic year is set to increase by 2.8 percent to $55,440 from $53,929 marking the eighth consecutive year the university’s undergraduate tuition has risen. 
Georgetown University Provost Robert Groves announced the tuition raise for the upcoming academic term in a Jan 16. campuswide email. The tuition hike is down from the 3.5 percent increase observed last year. This decrease can be attributed to the planned removal of a mandatory Yates Field House membership fee, according to Groves.
Yates’ operations will not be affected by the fee’s elimination, according to  Georgetown University Director of Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh. Instead, students will now have have access to Yates through their tuition, Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The mandatory Yates membership fee costs students approximately $222 per semester, according to GUSA press secretary Jonathon Marek (SFS ’21).
However, even with the marginal decrease, Marek said the tuiton’s growth rate should be lower compared to that of peer universities, citing a national average of 2.3 percent for private four-year institutions. 
“We urge the administration to take action to further reduce the rate of tuition increases in years to come,” Marek wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Housing fees will also rise 1.9 percent for all on-campus housing, except for townhouses, which will increase in cost by four percent.
The university is working hard to reduce spending while maintaining the university’s commitment to education and funding scholarships, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill. 
Groves used the announcement to highlight the university’s $218 million allocation to financial aid, its largest investment to date. The university’s admissions process does not consider financial need when reviewing applications and commits to meeting all demonstrated need, Groves wrote.  
A minority of universities nationwide operate on need-blind admission policies, which prohibit the university from knowing an applicant’s financial status during the admission process while also promising to meet full need as Georgetown does. However, many of Georgetown’s peer schools such as the University of Chicago and Ivy League colleges share Georgetown’s policy. 
The university expects to spend 21 percent of tuition revenue on financial aid, according to a projection of expenses in the campuswide email. Educational instruction is anticipated to encompass 43 percent of tuition revenue.
Tuition is still prohibitively costly for many prospective Georgetown students, Marek wrote. 
“Significant progress has been made; however, more work is still necessary to ensure that a Georgetown education is accessible to all students, regardless of their financial background,” Marek wrote.
Georgetown provides some form of need-based financial aid to nearly 40 percent of its undergraduates, Hill wrote. Many of Georgetown’s peer universities, however, have higher rates of students receiving financial aid: 50 percent of undergraduates at Columbia University receive financial aid, 46 percent at University of California, Berkeley, and 43 percent at Duke University, according to U.S. News and World Report.
Increases in the tuition rate have previously sparked vocal pushback from students, including protests from undergraduates in 2016 spearheaded by a group called “Hoyas Against the Hike.”
In his campuswide email, Groves acknowledged the burden put on students in increasing tuition.
“We are very much aware of the significant investments students and families make to pursue a Georgetown education,” Groves wrote.

The Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service welcomed five new fellows to campus for the spring of 2019, including two political advisers, a journalist, a former congresswoman and a political strategist. 
The fellows include Dan Sena, former executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign; Antonia Ferrier, a partner at a Republican consulting firm; Paulette Aniskoff, the former director of former President Barack Obama’s office of public engagement; Jonathan Capehart, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post opinion writer; and former Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R–Fla.), the first Latina to serve in Congress.
Spring 2019 is the eighth semester for which GU Politics has selected fellows to engage with students on campus through weekly, not-for-credit discussion groups on current issues in politics ranging from the Democrats winning the majority in the U.S. House of Representative in 2018 to the nuances of political advocacy through media. The fellows discussed their desire to hear student perspectives in their politics, public service and journalism seminars this semester in a Jan. 18 interview with The Hoya.
Why did you decide to be GU Politics Fellows, and what specifically about Georgetown students, the values or the mission specifically prompted that decision?
Aniskoff: One of the reasons is that I have seen so many people in the last two years going into public service to make money, and so many scandals, and so much craziness that I want to give a firm reminder to people that going into public service is one of the best careers you can have to do something great for your country, to have a really sort of rigorous and interesting career that is part of government. 
And then very selfishly, I just wanted to do something that would be fun and give me hope that we’re going to recover soon. So that’s my very overly honest answer.
Ros-Lehtinen: I was a member of Congress forever. But I love to exchange views with young people, and they’re probably more liberal than I am, maybe they’re not, I can’t wait to find out. We’re going to be discussing different topics on foreign affairs, big cases like the Cuba sanctions and the Iran nuclear deal, so what drew me to Georgetown was it’s such an intellectual powerhouse and I’ve had many colleagues who have been fellows here and they had a wonderful experience, it was very productive and entertaining also.
Capehart: I wanted to be a fellow because I wanted to learn from you. You meaning the students here at Georgetown, and particularly this generation because as I’ve seen from the Parkland kids on, you guys are going to be the ones who are going to lead this country to a better place. By sitting in the discussion groups and listening to you and learning from you, you are going to help me do my job better.
Sena: My job was to win back the House of Representatives for the Democrats. Along the way, I had the opportunity to come and do, with my Republican colleague, an evening debate here and the students just blew me away. The smarts and the energy and the feedback was so amazing. As I left that night, I turned to somebody who was in GU Politics and I said, whatever I have to do, I would love to come back. 
Ferrier: Truth be told, one of the primary reasons that I am here is because I was rejected from Georgetown undergrad. So this is my comeback, I’m proud to be a Hoya now even though I obviously did not graduate from here. Secondly, I participated in some of the group discussions for two previous fellows and had such a good time. The back and forth, I learned as much from the students as I hope they learned from me. I think it’s fair to say that campus is fairly more left-leaning than right-leaning, and I love busting people’s preconceptions about Republicans, so that’ll be fun too.
What do you hope us students will take away from the program?
Sena: Democracy is messy. And historically it’s been messy; it’s messy right now, it doesn’t mean that the wheels are going to come off, it doesn’t mean you throw in the towel, it doesn’t mean that all light is lost. It’s just that democracy is messy. And part of being an American is working through all these pieces. So I hope it’s kind of that hope that folks walk away with. The friction is just fine. It’s supposed to be that way.
Ros-Lehtinen: I think we all will learn a lot from the students. And I think that we’ll find out, I hope, in my class, that there’s so many diverse views of foreign policy and who calls the shots; sometimes it’s just the perception it’s not really the powers that the Constitution gives to the branches, but the way that the President or someone in Congress projects that they’re the ones in charge. 
How did you decide what to focus on in your discussion topics? And do you think that today’s political situation influenced that choice? 
Aniskoff: For me, it was a huge part of my decision. Today’s political influence on me makes me want to make sure every citizen is engaged, whether it be on a very small spare-time level, or their full-time job in the future. I think everyone should be civically engaged and take ownership of our country, and make sure that they are a part of the process and that they get to exercise the rights that we luckily have here.
Ferrier: I’ve worked for I don’t even know how long, and rough-and-tumble political communications from the Republican side. There is just more and more and more tools and more and more and more noise. How do you prioritize, how are you going to figure out what you’re going to listen to? So sort of looking at how you break that down, who listens to what and how is it effective or not, in terms of actually having an agenda and things you want to get done.  
Aniskoff will be leading a discussion group on political advocacy through the media. Ferrier will be holding a discussion group on the changing nature of communication in politics.
There’s a lot of animosity towards the news and journalists today. How has this affected or changed your job at all?
Capehart: That is actually what is driving a lot of my discussion group, is to demystify what it is to be a journalist in general and an opinion writer in particular. The number one discussion group is going to be: What is news? And the second one is going to be the difference between news and opinion. The lines have been blurred, obviously, but there is a difference. What makes our jobs harder now is because people don’t read, they don’t listen, they’re popping off with half or no information, and that makes our jobs very hard.

The Virginia House of Delegates’ Privileges and Elections Subcommittee voted against a resolution to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment on Jan. 22. 
The Virginia Senate passed a bill to ratify the ERA on Jan. 15. If the House had voted to ratify the amendment, Virginia would have been the 38th state to do so, which could allow Congress to add the ERA, an amendment to guarantee the legal equality of the sexes, to the Constitution. 
After Illinois became the 37th state to ratify the ERA earlier this year, Senator Steve Andersson (R-Ill.), issued a request to Virginia’s legislative leadership to push forward a bill ratifying the amendment. Virginia is considered the most likely state to provide the 38th ratification, which would surpass the three-fourths of states necessary, according to CNN. 
While the decision of the Privileges and Elections Subcommittee, which deals with matters concerning voting, apportionment and conflicts of interest, is only a recommendation to the full committee, the committee does not usually bring up a bill if it has previously been rejected, The Washington Post reported. 
The ERA was first proposed in 1923 by the National Woman’s Party, a political party formed to fight for women’s suffrage, but it did not pass Congress. The amendment was then revived in the 1960s, following the emergence of second-wave feminism, which focused on issues such as domestic violence prevention, reproductive rights and workplace rights. 
The U.S. Senate approved the ERA in March 1972 after the amendment won two-thirds of the U.S. House of Representatives votes. In October 1971, Hawaii ratified the amendment the same day it was passed in Congress, becoming the first state to ratify the ERA. 
The ERA failed to acquire the necessary number of ratifications before 1982, the deadline set by Congress in order for it to become codified into law. Three-fourths of states must ratify an amendment through state conventions or legislatures for the change to become a part of the Constitution. 
“I made the most historical vote I will ever make, but it is useless without you,” Andersson said. “We’re the 37th state, you’re the 38th. So you make the history, you pass this over the line, and you’ll be doing it for all of us.” 
Virginia Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy (D-Va.), who co-sponsored the bill along with state Senator Glen Sturtevant (R-Va.), began a statewide bus tour to campaign for the ERA. The bill has received support from organizations including the National Organization for Women, the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Bar Association.
The amendment received bipartisan support in the Virginia Senate, with seven Republicans joining Democrats in a 26-to-14 vote to pass the bill, according to The Washington Post. 
The ERA is necessary to establish gender equality under the law, American Bar Association President Bob Carlson wrote in a letter to Virginia House Speaker Kirkland Cox (R-Va.). 
“It would require all judges to apply the highest standard of scrutiny when deciding cases involving sex discrimination,” Carlson wrote. “This means judges would use the same standard of review in sex discrimination cases that they now use in deciding cases involving discrimination based on race, religion and national origin.” 
Critics of the ERA argue that it could threaten workforce protections specifically for women and cause a mandatory draft of women into the military, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. 
Even if 38 states ratify the ERA, the amendment still may not be added to the Constitution because the ratification period, which was set by Congress, elapsed in 1982. However, Congress has the power to extend the ratification date further, according to Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring. 
“As recognized by the constitutional scholars who testified before Congress and in the report of the House Judiciary Committee recommending the extension, the limited Supreme Court precedent in this area suggests that Congress has the authority to extend the ratification deadline,” Herring wrote in an opinion issued to Virginia State Senator Richard Black (R-Va.). 
Hoya Staff Writer Yolanda Spura contributed reporting.

An estimated 65,000 protesters participated in this year’s Women’s March in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 19, even as the organizers face widespread criticism because of close association with antisemitic rhetoric.
Tens of thousands assembled in D.C. on Saturday to protest in favor of the rights of minority groups, an end to violence and environmental justice. March Forward Virginia, the organization responsible for arranging D.C.’s march, estimated around 65,000 attended the march, a number that approximately matches the 50,000 to 70,000 estimated to have marched in 2018.
Both years have failed to equal the record-breaking numbers of people who marched in 2017, with 500,000 marchers in just Washington. Multiple prominent media outlets including The Washington Post have speculated low turnout could be due to the accusations of antisemitism surrounding the organization’s leaders this year.
The Women’s March was accused of promoting antisemitism after Co-President Tamika Mallory posted a photo of her alongside Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the black nationalist group Nation of Islam, on May 11, 2017, calling him the “GOAT.” In February 2017, Farrakhan delivered a speech in which he called Jews “satanic.” The Nation of Islam has been listed as hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Mallory has refused to take down the post or condemn Farrakhan’s statements because of his contributions to black communities, according to ABC News. 
Teresa Shook, a retired lawyer and the original founder of the Women’s March, wrote a Nov. 19 Facebook post calling for the march’s current leaders, Mallory, Bob Bland, Linda Sarsour and Carmen Perez, to step down. The leaders’ refusal to separate themselves from organizations promoting antisemitic, racist and homophobic rhetoric has caused them to deviate from the movement’s original values, Shook said. 
“I call for the current Co-Chairs to step down and to let others lead who can restore faith in the Movement and its original intent,” Shook wrote. “As Women’s March founder, I am stepping up to bring focus back to the Unity Principles on which our movement began.”
The march highlighted a variety of diverse issues such as climate change, access to health care and criminal justice reform, according to Hunter Spillan (SFS ’22), who attended the protest.
“I am so glad I attended, because I found the Women’s March to be an outpouring of inclusive and intersectional support,” Spillan wrote in a message to The Hoya. “Signs there reflect a variety of social and political issues, not just women’s rights — including racial and economic issues. ”
Aware of the allegations, Spillan said she attended in spite of the disappointment with the organizers.
“Though I was initially thrown by the recent scandal about the founders’ lack of response to their antisemitic views, I decided that this movement is larger than the actions of any individual person,” Spillan said.
In response to the criticism the organization has received, Women’s March National Organizer Linda Sarsour released a statement clarifying the march’s goals.
“The Women’s March exists to fight bigotry and discrimination in all their forms — including homophobia and anti-semitism — and to lift up the voices of women who are too often left out,” Sarsour wrote. “We’re committed to deepening relationships with any community who has felt left out of this movement.”
The march, which started at 10 a.m. at Freedom Plaza on Pennsylvania Avenue, featured speakers such as actor Ashley Judd, feminist writer Gloria Steinem, Trayvon Martin’s mother Sybrina Fulton, President of Planned Parenthood Cecile Richards and former Ohio State Senator Nina Turner (D-Ohio).
Protests like the Women’s March help keep politicians accountable for their actions, Turner said. 
“It’s one thing to protest, and we need protests to remind the people with special titles that the everyday people of this country will not have our voices suppressed,” Turner said. “The State of the Union matters, but the state of the streets matter more.”
Though counterprotesters, some of whom held anti-abortion signs, attended the march, the protesters persisted, Spillan wrote.
“One particular moment I remember is when we marched past a group of all-male pro-life protesters, holding graphic and scientifically incorrect signs about abortion,” Spillan wrote. “The entire crowd of women’s marchers started a chant of ‘My body, my choice.’”
The controversy has been difficult to keep up with, according to Georgetown University College Democrats Chair Rebecca Hollister (COL ’21).
“As a Jewish woman, I take these concerns extremely seriously,” Hollister wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Due to the controversy and differing opinions surrounding the benefits of the march, we are not sponsoring the event in particular.”
Students can help increase the diversity of voices represented by trying to listen to, and understand, different perspectives, according to Hollister.
“I firmly believe that listening is the most important way to resolve conflict and foster understanding,” Hollister wrote. “It’s incredibly important in this day and age to take a step back and actively listen to try and understand someone or a different group.”
Georgetown University College Republicans does not support the Women’s March both for its political agenda and the antisemitism associated with the founders, GUCR President Hayley Grande (COL ’21) wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“However, the official agenda of the Women’s March proposes leftist policy interventions that detract from its central tenet of women’s equality and are not endorsed by GUCR,” Grande wrote. “Furthermore, GUCR strongly condemns the public anti-semitism espoused by top leaders of the Women’s March and refuses to support an organization associated with such bigotry.”

Thousands of anti-abortion activists, including Georgetown University students, attended the annual Washington, D.C. March for Life on the National Mall on Jan. 18.
The March for Life began in protest of the Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, which held that the right to an abortion was protected by the 14th Amendment. The first march took place on Jan. 22, 1974.
President Donald Trump addressed attendees through a video feed, listing legislative action the administration has taken to advance the anti-abortion cause, according to a Jan. 19 White House news release. Vice President Mike Pence addressed the audience in person and commended Trump for nominating conservative judges to the federal bench and Supreme Court, according to CNN.
Members of Georgetown Right to Life, an anti-abortion student group, attended the event. Enthusiasm for the march among members of the club has remained constant over the years, according to GU Right to Life President Caroline Willcox (COL ’19).
“We had the biggest showing of all our events so far,” Willcox said in an interview with The Hoya. “We had lots of students come out and join thousands of other pro-lifers from across the country to stand up for the voiceless in America.”
In tandem with the march, Georgetown hosted its annual Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life, the largest collegiate anti-abortion conference in the United States, on Saturday. Founded by Georgetown students in 2000, the mission of the conference is to promote discourse on the sacredness of human life.
Members of H*yas for Choice, an unrecognized pro-reproductive rights student group, attended a counterprotest to the March for Life in front of the Supreme Court, according to HFC Co-Director of Communications Elianna Schiffrik (SFS ’21). 
“We believe that having a physical presence in opposition to events such as the March and Cardinal O’Connor Conference, that advocate for the violation fundamental rights like a person’s right to a safe abortion and against the values of our community, is powerful and central to the fight for reproductive justice,” Schiffrik wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
If Georgetown promotes values held by the Catholic Church, the university should also provide a voice to students who disagree with those values, according to Georgetown University College Democrats chair Rebecca Hollister (COL ’21).
“Though I can understand that Georgetown has some obligation to what the Church believes, I think they need to allow the abortion debate to continue on campus by recognizing groups such as H*yas for Choice,” Hollister wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Dialogue is so important and diversity is often expressed as a value of Georgetown, but in that sense, I’m not sure the school practices what it preaches.”
Georgetown University College Republicans supports the march and seeks to create more dialogue around conservative values on campus, according to GUCR President Hayley Grande (COL ’21).
“GUCR is dedicated to upholding and promoting conservative values on campus, including protection for the rights of the unborn,” Grande wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We support the mission of the March for Life and always look forward to working with Right to Life to create more opportunities for pro-life events and dialogue on and off campus.”
Speakers at the march included Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D-Ill.), one of the only anti-abortion Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives; Carl Anderson, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus; and popular conservative speaker and Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Wire Ben Shapiro, who was scheduled to speak at Georgetown in March 2018 before inclement weather cancelled the event.
The unified message of the march was inspiring, Dalton Nunamaker (COL ’22), wrote in a statement to The Hoya after attending the march as a member of GUCR.
“Black or white, rich or poor, religious or atheist, even Democrat and Republican, people were united in love, positivity, and hope,” Nunamaker wrote. “I would encourage every Georgetown student to attend the March at least once to see for themselves the compassion behind the pro-life movement.”

Over 300 protesters gathered Wednesday in the Hart Senate Office Building to call for the end of the partial government shutdown that began Dec. 22.
The protesters observed a moment of silence that lasted 33 minutes, marking the 33 days of the government shutdown, according to The Hill. Following the moment of silence, protesters began chanting: “No more food banks; they need paychecks.”
Occupy Hart was organized by the National Federation of Federal Employees, a national union of government workers, along with other local organizations representing federal workers. NFFE represents 110,00 federal employees across the United States, as well as members of the foreign service.
The purpose of the protest was to urge the federal government, specifically Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), to pass legislation to the end the shutdown, according to NFFE communications director Brittany Holder.
“We wanted to really keep the pressure up on the Senate, especially Mitch McConnell, just because we wanted him to call a vote,” Holder said in an interview with the Hoya. “We are telling people — federal employees who are at home using more heat than they usually would, more electricity than they usually would — come get warm at Hart.”
Occupy Hart follows a Jan. 10 protest , which was also organized by the NFFE, at the AFL-CIO building, according to The Washington Post.
The government has been shut down since Dec. 22 as President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats face off on immigration. Democrats rejected Trump’s offer to temporarily postpone his executive action to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and Temporary Protected Status for immigrants from some countries in Latin America and Africa in exchange for $5.7 billion in border wall funding. Both parties had hoped to agree on legislation to end the shutdown this week, but failed to reach a compromise. 
The Senate voted down two competing bills to fund the government Thursday. Senate Republicans’ bill offered TPS and provided funding for the border wall, while Senate Democrats submitted a bill that would fund the government until Feb. 8 without border wall funding. 
The Georgetown Solidarity Committee, a club that advocates for workers’ rights, stands with the protesters and hopes to see a more forceful organizing among federal workers to end the shutdown, according to club member Obed Ventura (SFS ’19), who attended the protest in solidarity with the federal workers.
“This shutdown, on its 33rd day, has been denying people their wages for their labor; the ability to work; and the funding for housing, food, and other basic needs,” Ventura wrote in a message to The Hoya. “We admire the bravery of the workers to protest for an end to the shutdown and to get their paychecks.”
The federal government needs to reopen regardless of the state of compromise regarding the border wall, according to Holder. 
“Right now our main focus is to get the government open. It’s been closed for way too long,” Holder said. “They can decide what they want to do in regards to the wall while federal employees are still working.”
Furloughed federal workers will have missed their second paycheck since the shutdown began Wednesday night at midnight. Workers have lost about $5,000 each in delayed wages since the government shutdown began, and the shutdown’s direct and indirect costs to the economy have exceeded $1 billion, according to CBS News. Federal employees are especially vulnerable to lapses in paychecks as some earn as little as $27,000. 
If the government reopens, federal workers will receive back pay, but workers in the private sector whose jobs depend on the federal government will not be compensated, according to The Washington Post. 
The shutdown has caused many individuals and families to struggle with financial instability, Holder said. 
“One of our [federal] employees, his wife is recovering from cancer, and he has seven daughters, and he’s a furloughed firefighter who fought in the fires in California back in November,” Holder said. “We have a federal employee, she has $200,000 in school loans, she has a three-year-old who’s in day care.”
Though workers will receive back pay for their days missed, the government shutdown has left many federal employees unable to meet their immediate needs, Holder said.
“Congress and the president signed a bill that said they’re going to be repaid, but it’s kind of like, ‘What do I do right now? Do I pay for my mortgage or do I pay for my health insurance? Do I buy groceries or put gas in my car?’” Holder said.

Georgetown University partnered with the Kennedy Center for the 17th annual “Let Freedom Ring!” ceremony on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, celebrating King’s life and legacy by acknowledging those who continue to embody his life’s work.
Every year since 2003, Georgetown has presented the John Thompson Jr. Legacy of a Dream Award, named for the former Georgetown basketball coach and first award recipient, to an individual who has upheld the Jesuit values of people for others through community service.
The university presented this year’s award to Hawah Kasat at Monday’s event. Kasat is the co-founder and executive director of One Common Unity, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization founded in 2000 that seeks to break the cycle of community violence by promoting music, art and nonviolent practices. Kasat was announced as the recipient of the award in November. 
OCU’s principles of social justice are inspired by Kasat’s personal values and reflect King’s messages of nonviolence and advocacy, Kasat said in an interview with The Hoya.
“The organization is shaped by my individual values, of course, and I think as an individual, nonviolence and social justice are absolutely essential pillars and foundational cores to the work we do here at One Common Unity,” Kasat said. “In the spirit of Dr. King and in the spirit of advocating to create a beloved community, we are providing all of our participants, whether they’re youth, teachers or parents, with unconditional love and support.”
As part of the award, Kasat will join a yearlong sustained partnership with the university, seeking to increase visibility for OCU and its mission.
Before introducing a video tribute explaining OCU’s purpose and Kasat’s role in managing the organization, University President John J. DeGioia gave a brief speech about how Kasat’s work reflects King’s ideals of love and community building.
“When we reflect on the contributions of One Common Unity and the leadership of Hawah Kasat, we see love in action,” DeGioia said. “We see a spontaneous, unmotivated, groundless and creative love. We see an expression of mutuality, of interconnectedness, of community.”
In the video tribute, several of Kasat’s colleagues spoke about the positive effects OCU has had in the community, as well as the role Kasat has played in ensuring the growth and continuation of the organization.
Andy Shallal, CEO and founder of Busboys and Poets, D.C.-based restaurants founded with the mission of inspiring social change, praised the constructive work OCU has accomplished for the District.
“One Common Unity is what’s been needed, really, in this city for so long,” Shallal said in the video. “It’s a community of people that really takes folks that have been exposed to violence and other terrible things that happen sometimes in people’s lives and brings them outside the city,” 
Kasat founded OCU to teach and empower youth from under-resourced neighborhoods in D.C. In the 18 years since its founding, OCU, along with its flagship program, Fly By Light, has helped more than 25,000 youth and families through music, art, emotional wellness and peace education.
The award gives OCU the opportunity to partner with Georgetown students to broaden the organization’s reach in D.C., according to Kasat. 
“This award allows us to continue expanding to more schools and creating, potentially, an undergraduate cohort of Georgetown students that we can train in our model,” Kasat said. “We could then have those undergraduates be in schools with our facilitators and help implement our curriculum to impact more kids.”
The event also included several musical performances by Tony, Emmy and Grammy-winning artist Audra McDonald, Tony-winning artist Brian Stokes Mitchell, the Let Freedom Ring Choir led by music director Rev. Nolan Williams Jr., and the Georgetown jazz ensemble.
Following their final performance, McDonald and Mitchell closed the show with a reflection of the legacy that King has left behind and the importance of ensuring that it lives on in the future.
“If there’s anything that Dr. King left us, it’s that we are a part of a continuum,” Mitchell said. “We are all in this world together and we are all working together to try to make it better for each other and especially for our children, for the generation that comes after us.”

The Washington, D.C. Council overrode a Jan. 16 veto by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) on a bill that would downgrade the penalty for fare evasion, or failing to pay for travel on the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, on Tuesday.
Enacted in 1978, current D.C. Metro fare evasion law punishes Metro fare evaders with either a fine of up to $300, up to 10 days of jail time or a combination of both. The new bill will no longer allot jail time for Metro fare evasion offenders and decreases the punishment to a $50 civil fine with no possibility of indication on an arrest record.
Bowser vetoed the D.C. Metro Fare Evasion Decriminalization bill, which passed the D.C. Council on Dec. 4, citing its potential to perpetuate lawlessness, financial losses and crime in the District. After Bowser used her veto power on the bill, 11 of 13 councilmembers voted to override Bowser’s veto. The bill initially passed the D.C. Council Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety on Oct. 4.
The Metro loses $25 million a year because of fare evasion, according to The Washington Post. WMATA has expressed disapproval of the bill because of the potential for lost revenue. This concern comes at a time when WMATA is already financially threatened since ridership has plummeted because of the government shutdown, according to DCist. 
The amount of money lost through Metro fare evasion is not worth the cost of persecuting individuals who fail to pay for travel, according to Emmanuel Brantley, communications director for Councilmember Anita Bonds (D-At Large), who endorsed the bill. 
“The Councilmember was concerned with removing the criminality associated with fare evasion, and she was particularly concerned that prosecuting an individual who has committed fare evasion (an act that may cost between $2 and $5) would end up costing us tens of thousands of dollars and leave the individual with a criminal record, something that can be quite burdensome in the long run,” Brantley wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
There are other methods of enforcing fares that do not criminalize Metro users, according to Councilmember Robert White Jr. (D-At Large).
“We must override the Mayor’s veto of the Fare Evasion bill. There are alternatives to enforcing fares that aren’t drivers of discrimination & incarceration,” White wrote in a Jan. 17 tweet.
Bowser highlighted past projects she has implemented to make the Metro more equitable but continued to express concern for the bill after her veto was overridden in a press conference Tuesday. Although D.C. can work towards making the Metro more affordable for everyone, current rules must be enforced, Bowser said. 
“It is possible that as a city we can decide to support free Metro for whomever we want, to customize a program that works, but I am concerned that making sure that everyone follows the rules of the road, or the rules of the Metro as it were,” Bowser said.
D.C. councilmembers such as David Grosso (I-At Large) have discounted Bowser’s opposition to the bill, instead focusing on the benefits that the bill would provide to low-income communities in the District. The bill plans to break down systematic mass incarceration, Grosso wrote in a Jan. 17 tweet.
91 percent of criminal citations issued for Metro fare evasion are directed toward black residents, with citations disproportionately affecting black youth, according to a Sept. 13 report by the Washington Lawyers’ Committee.

Displaying the effects of increasingly frequent environmental disasters and engaging religious communities is necessary to motivate action against climate change, George Steinmetz, a freelance photographer, and Evan Berry, an American University associate professor of philosophy and religion, said at a Jan. 23 event.
Using aerial photography that can show the environment on large scales is one of the best ways to motivate the average citizen to combat climate change because it displays climate change’s effects on humans, Steinmetz said, speaking of his work.
“What I was trying to do was show the scope of the problem,” Steinmetz said. “I try to take pictures where there’s something human that you can relate to.”
The event, titled “Religion and Climate Change: A Visual and Scholarly Representation” was hosted by the Pulitzer Center in collaboration with the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, which studies the intersection of religion, ethics, and public life.
Religious elements are woefully absent from popular discourse on climate change, according to Director of the Berkeley Center Shaun Casey.
“Many of today’s international crises have a strong religious component, yet media coverage often omits or oversimplifies these complexities and nuances,” Casey said. “A deep examination of faith and values is central and critical to addressing today’s global challenges.”
Journalism and religion both use human-centered narratives that can catalyze social organization, according to Berry, who studies issues of community action.
“One thing that journalism and religion have in common is that they’re both ways of telling stories about how different groups of people experience what’s going on places,” Berry said.
Berry has previously examined religion’s influence on both climate change and environmentalism in his 2015 book, “Devoted to Nature: The Religious Roots of Environmentalism.” 
Religion is an integral to climate change’s impacts, Berry wrote, alongside co-authors Willis Jenkins and Luke Beck Kreider in a July 2018 article “Religion and Climate Change.”
“Understanding the cultural dimensions of climate change requires understanding its religious aspects,” Berry wrote with his co-authors.
Steinmetz, who often captures aerial images and landscapes, was assigned by The New York Times Magazine to find the best visual representations of climate change on each continent — a search that led him to photograph Iceland, China and Western Africa. Steinmetz also followed several American natural disasters such as Hurricane Harvey and three recent California wildfires.
His photographs were originally used for an article in The Times Magazine in Aug. 2018 titled “Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change.”
Steinmetz said using moving and still pictures to supplement the article was both effective and powerful.
The Pulitzer Center has designed a model curriculum around the “Losing Earth” article that can be used in classroom ranging from elementary school to college. The project teaches students journalism skills through stories on climate change.
Georgetown University and the Berkley Center are members of the Pulitzer Center’s campus consortium network, which aims to engage students and faculty in conversations about important issues and how they are covered in the media.
Visual mediums of journalism such as photography and documentary film have great potential to communicate the impacts of climate change, Berry and panel members said.
“I’m a big believer in documentary film. I think it’s a really important and powerful tool, both long and short documentaries,” Berry said. “They can tell stories in a way that isn’t merely just images, but also helps people sympathize with characters who come to life.”
Both Berry and Steinmetz agreed citizens of developed countries like the United States have the responsibility to help others combat climate change.
“There’s a set of conversations about what we ought to do in response to climate change that have to do with lowering our emissions and there’s also a set of conversations about what we ought to do that are related to helping communities adapt to rapidly changing environments,” Berry said. 
The United Nations has identified the growing problem of climate refugees — migrants who have been forced to leave their homelands due to issues related to changing climate patterns, such as flooding, and are disproportionately poor — as few systems to relocate individuals displaced by environmental disasters yet function at high capacities.
At the commencement ceremony for the School of Foreign Service’s class of 2018, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said climate change would be one of the most pressing issues younger generations will need to tackle.
Steinmetz said that while he thinks the photographs are compelling, he is unsure if they can motivate individuals to act.
“I think people will look at these pictures and think, ‘Wow, that’s a really big problem,’ but, to be honest, I don’t know if that makes them think, ‘What can I personally do?’” Steinmetz said. “But I think it comes down to what we can do individually.”
