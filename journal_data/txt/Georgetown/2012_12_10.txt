The Georgetown University Student Association Senate unanimously passed a resolution to establish a Safe Spaces Program for peer support against harassment Sunday.
According to co-sponsor of the bill GUSA senate Speaker Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), the bill was created to enforce the recommendation made by the GUSA Executive 2012 Report on Safe Transitions.
The mission of the Spaces Space Program is to enable students to combat prejudice and to increase support for victims of bias and harassment.
“The program aims to make students aware of available resources and create a safe and welcoming environment for all Hoyas,” the resolution reads.
“This is founded in something I’m personally very passionate about. We need to create a program to encourage students to talk about these issues without having to worry about things moving beyond their control. This program will create a system where students can get help and connected with resources without concern,” Tisa said.
The program includes a training program to train student advocates to deal with sexual assault, relationship violence, harassment and discrimination and to provide personal support for victims of bias and harassment.
“We think this is a good step to combating bias and discrimination from a grassroots level,” co-sponsor of the bill GUSA Senator Jay Factor (COL ’14) said.
Several GUSA senators echoed the importance having resources available for peer support in addition to help offered by the administration.
“Knowing a couple friends who have had to go through the bias reporting system, having peers to help you out is an immediate comfort,” GUSA Senator Elizabeth Oh (SFS ’15) said.
The program will work in conjunction with the GUSA Executive, LGBTQ Resource Center, Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, Residential Life, Counseling and Psychiatric Services and various administrators to train student advocates.
“We’re trying to provide personal support as supposed to institutional support. We’re trying to create grassroots movement that is not promoting diversity from the top down but from the bottom up,” Tisasaid.

University President John J. DeGioia announced that Georgetown has joined edX, a platform for broadcasting massive open online courses, at an Economic Club of Washington, D.C., event Monday.
The platform, which was founded jointly by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is also used by such institutions as the University of California, Berkeley and Wellesley College, will allow Georgetown to broadcast select course offerings to thousands of viewers across the globe free of charge.
According to DeGioia, offering MOOCs will allow the university to learn how technology can best be used to enhance the classroom experience and to understand how teaching can be optimized for the digital sphere. DeGioia added that the introduction of MOOCs will not undermine the unique Georgetown educational experience, in which face-to-face interaction between students and professors is paramount.
“It’s hard to imagine how a lot of that [face-to-face interaction] could be replaced by MOOCs,” DeGioia said. “What it’s really about is finding the sweet spot … between a residential university with classrooms … blended with the use of technology.”
While course offerings on edX so far have been concentrated in the hard sciences, DeGioia said that Georgetown is likely to contribute social sciences and humanities courses.
“We’re delighted to have Georgetown as part of the group … with its capacity in public service … and government,” Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust, who was the feature speaker at the Economic Club Event, said.
Neither Georgetown nor its peer institutions currently plan to give credit for the courses they offer in MOOC format, but Faust said that Harvard has been issuing certificates for course completion.
According to University Provost Robert Groves, Georgetown’s investment in MOOCs is part of a broader scheme to embrace technology in the classroom, marked by its recent announcement of the Initiative on Technology-Enhanced Learning, which will distribute $8 million in grants for faculty- and student-generated technology proposals.
“It’s all one big fabric … all part of one package,” he said.
Groves added that the university plans to ramp up its information technology infrastructure in order to support these new initiatives.
DeGioia said that the first Georgetown MOOC will be launched on the edX platform in fall 2013.

A small fire originating in the overhead light in room 604 of Kennedy Hall caused the evacuation of the entire Southwest Quad late Sunday evening.
Residents of McCarthy, Kennedy and Reynolds Halls waited on MultiSport Facility for about 30 minutes before the Department of Public Safety gave the “all clear” signal.
While there appeared to be no significant fire or water damage to the affected room, the two residents will be forced to stay in an alternate location for a few days while University Facilities staff inspects and cleans the room, which was covered in a layer of dust after the incident.
No injuries were reported.
