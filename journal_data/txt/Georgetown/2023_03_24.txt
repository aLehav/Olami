Ed Cooley, the former head coach of the Providence Friars, promised that a national championship win is on the horizon for the Georgetown University Hoyas.
After a record-breaking Big East losing streak over the past two seasons resulted in the departure of Patrick Ewing (CAS ’85), the university appointed Cooley as the new head coach of the Georgetown men’s basketball program March 20. Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) and Georgetown Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Lee Reed held an official press conference March 22 introducing Cooley as the new face of the program.
Cooley said his journey into such a prestigious leadership position as a Black man from a low-income background proves that anything is possible.
“I coach from experience, humility and appreciation,” Cooley told The Hoya. “I do not take anything for granted. The fact that I am the head coach of Georgetown right now says that dreams can come true, regardless of your background, regardless of what you look like.”
Cooley transformed Providence from a conference bottom feeder to a perennial powerhouse, posting a 242-153 record over his 12 seasons leading the Friars and earning seven NCAA Tournament berths. The team’s continuous improvements culminated in a Sweet 16 appearance that earned Cooley the 2022 Naismith Men’s Coach of the Year Award, an honor given annually to the best Division I basketball coach.
Reed said Cooley quickly emerged as the leading candidate to usher in a new era of Hoya men’s basketball following the heavily criticized tenure of Ewing.
“We needed a leader, someone who understood our identity and could re-imagine Georgetown basketball to fit today’s unique basketball landscape,” Reed said at the press conference. “Coach Cooley has a vision for our program on the court, in the classroom and in the community.”
DeGioia said Cooley facilitates a healthy environment for players, both on and off the court.
“Ed’s a builder,” DeGioia said at the press conference. “He builds teams. He builds community. He understands what it means for a team to be successful on the court and, most importantly, the role that athletics can play in the formation of the young men on his team.”
Although speculation surrounding Georgetown’s new coach started months before Ewing’s departure, the official hiring process lasted a mere 48 hours, beginning when Providence exited the NCAA Tournament. Georgetown, with support from management and consulting firm CRG, negotiated with Cooley and Dennis Coleman, who serves as a senior counsel at Ropes & Gray law firm, before quickly finalizing the decision.
For Cooley, a cohesive community requires a healthy reciprocal relationship between athletes and the Georgetown community at large. He stressed the importance of maintaining accountability and inclusivity to build widespread support for the program.
“The commitment to excellence is not just on the court, it’s in the classroom, and for all of you, get ready,” Cooley said at the press conference. “I am super inclusive. I want to meet you. I want to know your names. I want you to see and evolve with us from day one, because we cannot do it alone.”
When Cooley first joined Providence in 2011, LaDontae Henton was his first recruit. Twelve years and a stint in professional basketball later, Henton now serves as the Friars’ associate director of player development, scouting and recruiting coordination — having coached under Cooley’s guidance for the last two seasons.
“He built real life relationships off the court to where you can trust him,” Henton told The Hoya. “And he gains players’ trust. Guys would run through a wall for him — knowing that he’s genuine, he’s kind, he’s going to be real with you and he’s going to hold you accountable.”
Henton witnessed firsthand Cooley’s efforts to rebuild the Providence men’s basketball team as a four-year starter under Cooley. Drawing from his experiences both as a player and athletics staffer for the Friars, Henton said Cooley’s actions as a coach back up his bold aspirations.
“I’ve seen him when he had dreams of what he could make happen at Providence College, and I believed in him from the start,” Henton said. “Everything that he talked about when he took over the job, and he recruited people, he did.”
“The growth of Ed Cooley never stops,” Henton added. “He wants to be better. He wants to be great at his job, and he strives to do that every day, and that hasn’t changed since I met him.” 
Cooley said he is determined to bring that winning spirit with him to Georgetown, starting with carrying over some familiar faces from his former staff at Providence to the Hilltop. 
Cooley exclusively confirmed to The Hoya that Providence Assistant Coach Ivan Thomas would “definitely” be joining Georgetown’s staff. 
Cooley said his coaching team will embody passion, energy and a strong work ethic.
“Nobody will outwork this group, nobody,” Cooley said at the press conference. “There will not be one staff in the country that will outwork the staff that is about to arrive at the Hill. I can tell you that.”
Cooley said his players must also subscribe to a philosophy of grit and personal excellence.
“We need to make sure we have not the best players, but the best people, that are good players, that have incredible integrity, that have character, that have passion, that have a chip on their shoulder to want to be a champion,” Cooley said.
Cooley said he aims to inject energy into a tired Georgetown program after its two seasons of repeated losses. 
“I promise you, we’re gonna win games,” Cooley said at the press conference. “We’re not gonna win a little. We’re gonna win a lot.”
Despite ambitious goals, Cooley said it is also important to remember such large-scale changes only happen with widespread buy-in from all interested parties of the basketball program.
“We need everybody in here to give us a chance,” Cooley said at the press conference. “The word ‘patience’ is always hard, because everyone wants it and they want it right now. Have a little bit of patience, right? Rome wasn’t built in a day, as we all say, but it was built.”
Cooley admitted waiting for change might feel painful, but he said it is integral that Georgetown basketball does not dwell on past failures.
“I never look in the past. I’m a present and move forward person. What happened yesterday, happened yesterday, we cannot control it,” Cooley told The Hoya. “But we can control what is happening today and what’s going to happen in the future.”
Henton said Cooley is the perfect person for any team looking to rebound. 
“​​I really think that Coach Cooley is a winner in life, and that translates to basketball,” Henton said. “Everything that he’s been through, he’s been a winner. He’s going to win wherever he’s at, wherever he’s put.”

A professor and legislative expert spoke about her latest book, which examines the legislative process on Capitol Hill, during an event hosted by Georgetown University’s government department.
Maya Kornberg, a research fellow at New York University and an adjunct professor at Georgetown, wrote “Inside Congressional Committees: Function and Dysfunction in the Legislative Process” and discussed it with Georgetown students and community members at the March 20 event. Kornberg’s work draws from her doctoral project about how congressional committees are a place of deliberation and learning. She expanded on the project significantly for the next seven years after realizing it was an avenue she wanted to pursue professionally.
At the event, Kornberg outlined problems that plague the field of policymaking, including insufficient staff, pervasive lobbyist involvement and the widespread presence of staunch partisanship and cameras on Capitol Hill. 
Despite these issues, Kornberg said she feels students interested in working in government, and specifically on Capitol Hill, should be excited about the opportunities on the horizon that those careers offer.
“I’m definitely an optimist,” Kornberg told The Hoya. “Staff have real power to shape things. They should be encouraged at the amount of power they could have if they worked in Congress. I think there’s a lot of space and room for encouragement.”
In her book, Kornberg proposes reforms to the legislative process such as investing in fostering a skilled and diverse staff on Capitol Hill, creating more spaces for bipartisan relationship-building and rethinking hearing formats to foster a wider impact.
Kornberg said a priority for legislative reform should be reorganizing and modernizing its intricate committee infrastructure.
“The last time that Congress reorganized its committee jurisdictions was in the 1970s, and as a result of that, also as a result of other things, we don’t have one committee with sole jurisdiction over things like the tech industry because it didn’t exist in the 1970s,” Kornberg said at the event. “That and many other issues fall through the cracks more easily when you don’t have a committee dealing with them.”
Kornberg said statistics show that there is truth to the narrative that Congress spends more time arguing with one another than pushing through actual laws.
“We look at Congress today and see a hyperpartisan Congress,” Kornberg said at the event. “Congress today is legislating a lot less; it’s passing less legislation than it was, by far, than decades ago. Legislators are spending about a third of their time legislating, which is crazy given that their job is to be a legislator.”
Kornberg said congressional committees stand out, as the testimonies shared there are authentic and often deeply personal experiences.
“Committees are a space for members to hear from just ordinary American voices,” Kornberg said at the event. “There aren’t that many spaces in Congress for that to happen. It’s not necessarily the scientist from NASA — not that those testimonies are not important — but, the ones that shape them, the ones that they held up, were the WNBA star who grew up on food stamps and the journalist who lived with ISIS and the mother of a sex trafficking victim.”
Kornberg gave attendees an inside look into her research methods while acknowledging the limitations of her work given the vastness of the inner workings of Congress.
“I couldn’t look at all the committees because each chamber has about 20 committees in any given Congress,” Kornberg said at the event. “I chose a sample of eight committees, and the committees that I chose vary in terms of partisanship.”
Georgetown’s location in Washington, D.C., should encourage students to engage with the legislative process on Capitol Hill, according to Kornberg.
“It’s a real luxury to be here in D.C. and be able to just attend congressional hearings and see for yourself what’s going on,” Kornberg told The Hoya.

The Georgetown University Graduate Student Government (GradGov), which represents members of the graduate school community, is holding elections this weekend to select its Executive Board for the 2023-24 academic year.
Candidates are running for various positions, including Executive President, Executive Vice President and Treasurer, as well as various director positions tasked with advocacy efforts, communication management and technology development. Students interacted with candidates as they shared their visions for Georgetown’s graduate schools at a March 17 town hall before polls open.
While polls are not open to the general graduate student body, GradGov senators will be able to cast their ballots using a ranked-choice system from March 24-26, according to GradGov Director of Elections Mac Milin Kiran (GRD ’25).
Aurmin Amirmokri (GRD ’24), a candidate for Executive President, said solutions to improve student housing accessibility are at the top of his list of priorities as a candidate.
“A lot of graduate students have been having a lot of trouble with housing, they’ve been priced out. Availability is really poor, especially in these market conditions,” Amirmokri told The Hoya. “I want to be able to build some sort of coalition or partnership with apartments that are already in place, that already have some Georgetown graduate students.”
The Washington, D.C. metropolitan area faces a housing shortage, according to a data analysis from the Brookings Institute. The Georgetown neighborhood faces an amplified problem, as multimillion dollar homes and a lack of available units rank it as a “high-end” neighborhood for renters, pushing many graduate students to more affordable areas that come with the tradeoff of a sometimes lengthy commute, including areas in northern Virginia like Rosslyn and Arlington.
Amirmokri said he also hopes to advocate for the specific needs of graduate students, including expanding the offerings of professional development opportunities.
“I want to make sure we have the resources and support we need to succeed,” Amirmokri said. “This could include research and networking, advocating for better funding and support for our graduate students and so forth.”
Micaila Curtis (GRD ’25), another candidate for Executive President, said that while the heavy course load associated with graduate school can be burdensome, the impact she is able to make through GradGov inspires her to continue to engage with the organization.
“I find meaningful purpose in serving my peers, hearing their stories, constantly being inspired by them, and knowing that ‘hobbies’/activities outside my Ph.D. work can help bring positive change in this world, too,” Curtis wrote to The Hoya.
Curtis also said that she hopes to see GradGov and its members connect in a meaningful way with the administrators who keep the university running.
“Some current initiatives I hope to continue are building more collaborative partnerships with our higher administrative members across more branches, so more of our GradGov leaders are able to work directly with the university’s faculty and staff and learn more about their roles on an institutional level,” Curtis wrote.
Alex Grant (GRD ’24), a candidate for Executive Vice President, said he aspires to modernize the disorganized legislative process within GradGov and create a space in which student representatives can effectively address issues faced by students.
“My number one priority is to give the power to the senators from each graduate school and program to address the issues their constituents are passionate about,” Grant wrote to The Hoya. “This tool will be a game changer for the senate to hear and address the concerns such as international student affairs, transportation and housing, to name a few, which are dear to graduate students.”
Grant, who currently serves as a GradGov senator and as its deputy director of student rights and conduct, said joining the organization has been an enriching experience. Grant said he encourages students interested in GradGov to find ways to get involved.
“GradGov offers the opportunity for you to have your voice heard and make an impact on campus,” Grant wrote. “You don’t necessarily have to be elected, you could join one of our working groups or apply to be the director or deputy director of a committee.”
No matter the outcome at the ballot box, Amirmokri said that GradGov will be run well and with dedication from its chief executives.
“Regardless of the outcome, I really think whoever’s President and Vice President, Georgetown is in great hands,” Amirmokri said. “Everybody really cares deeply about the school and just wants the best for the entire student body.”

While today’s students use PDF files and watch video documentaries, one professor maintains that an often overlooked medium plays a key role in human history — parchment, the thin material made from animal skin.
Bruce Holsinger, a professor and researcher at the University of Virginia, gave the 2023 Lacay Lecture, co-hosted by the Georgetown University Humanities Initiative and the departments of English and global medieval studies. Holsinger, who specializes in pre-modern literary history and culture, spoke about his most recent publication, “On Parchment: Animals, Archives, and the Making of Culture from Herodotus to the Digital Age,” which delves into the role of animal skins in writing, arts and culture.
Holsinger combined his expertise in medieval cultural studies with that of scientific experts in conservation and bioarchaeology to develop the concept for his book and the Lacay Lecture.
Sarah McNamer, a professor and the director of the global medieval studies program at Georgetown who introduced Holsinger at the event, said his work transcends the boundaries of any one field.
“Professor Holsinger’s work is so rich and varied that it’s difficult to sum him up in any succinct way,” McNamer said at the event. “But we might start by describing him as a specialist in the literature and culture of the medieval world.”
McNamer, also a medieval scholar, said Holsinger’s work helps dissect the inconvenient, and often problematic, role of human-animal interactions in chronicling human history.
“It is a typical Bruce Holsinger impulse to move towards such problems, boldly leading us into new interdisciplinary territory and helping us to see the manifold ways in which humans have literally enrolled animals in the task of memorializing the past,” McNamer said.
Holsinger said that without the use of animal skins in writing, specifically parchment, much of human history before the use of paper would have been lost to time.
“For well over a thousand years, the societies of the Euro-Mediterranean world transmitted and preserved much of their written cultures on the skins of animals,” Holsinger said. “If it were not for the countless beasts whose hides served these and other scribes and illuminators over many centuries, we might now possess only fragments of ancient culture.”
Holsinger said embracing multiple academic disciplines was key in his research and writing processes. Holsinger said it is challenging to maintain the unique identities of the many worlds that he studies.
“One of the challenges entailed in writing a book about parchment is that indeed, one of the medium’s own provocations came in engaging these distinctive cultures on their own terms without sacrificing their methodological specificity or their specialized idioms in the name of a flattening interdisciplinarity,” Holsinger said.
Holsinger recounted the scientific aspect of the research that he participated in, including the intricate process of extracting molecules from precious ancient manuscripts to study their parchment without damaging their structural integrity.
To solve this unique problem, Holsinger said scientists he worked with, specifically archaeology expert Sarah Fiddyment, used pencil erasers to clean the 1,000-year-old York Gospels without physically altering any of the documents.
“How can you justify cutting up a priceless manuscript for biomolecules? How can sampling be done at a scale that would make such inquiries worthwhile?” Holsinger said, referring to Fiddyment. “She does so not by sacrilegiously snipping off a corner of a Chaucer manuscript, but by using the very waste produced by conservationists around the world working to clean and restore membrane documents.”
Following his remarks at the event, Holsinger participated in an interview with The Hoya. 
Holsinger said he takes advantage of the wide array of parchment manuscripts that have been made available online in the 21st century.
“Many of them already are digitized,” Holsinger told The Hoya. “There’s massive amounts of digitization that have happened in the last 20 years. I teach from digitized manuscripts all the time, and there’s already so much out there.”
Holsinger said that while the use of parchment seems worlds away to students in this modern day and age, the influence of the material is both timeless and meaningful to Georgetown.
“Georgetown is a Jesuit school, and the Jesuits were great leaders of manuscripts and were great students of medieval theology, most of which survives on parchment,” Holsinger said. “It’s always going to be relevant as part of the intellectual tradition of the school.”

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton headlined an event honoring the role women played in crafting the Good Friday Agreement, a peace agreement that ended a deadly period of conflict in Northern Ireland 25 years ago.
The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS) hosted the March 16 conference to highlight the importance of women peacemakers in concluding The Troubles, a 30-year extended conflict between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland that killed nearly 3,000 and injured over 40,000 in the late 1990s. The conference also commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, which ended The Troubles. 
Melanne Verveer, former U.S. ambassador for global women’s issues and GIWPS executive director, moderated the event, which included discussions with a slate of 14 politicians, experts and activists. Leaders in attendance included Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister; Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland; and Karen Pierce, the British ambassador to the United States.
Hillary Clinton visited Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland, as First Lady during the Good Friday negotiations. Clinton and her husband, Bill, who was president at the time of the Good Friday Agreement, broke from presidential tradition by choosing to get involved in the peace talks in Northern Ireland.
Clinton said it is imperative that conflicts like the one in Ireland do not continue to inhibit the future success of affected populations by maintaining long term political stability.
“The violence that afflicted Northern Ireland for so many years was an impediment to people’s full potential — for them following their own dreams and understanding what was possible, not just for themselves but their families and their society,” Clinton said at the event. “So first and foremost, we have to continue to prevent violence.”
Varadkar said that women are often ignored in the accolades that follow important diplomatic proceedings such as the Good Friday Agreement — a dynamic he feels must change.
“In truth, women from across the political spectrum were able to contribute to everything that happened, except for photographs at the end,” Varadkar said at the event. “Women’s leadership, vision and inspiration is needed today more so than ever to ensure that Northern Ireland, and all of Ireland, achieves its full potential.”
Female leaders played key roles in brokering the Good Friday Agreement, including rallying public support behind a 1998 referendum ratifying the peace accords, as well as bridging the sharp Protestant-Catholic divides that at times defined the conflict.
Robinson, the first female president of Ireland, said leading her country during such a tumultuous time enabled her to take risks in bridging gaps across a divided Irish people. Robinson embarked on a historic visit to Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland, in February 1992.
“The visit to Northern Ireland that stays with me most was the hardest one,” Robinson said. “The Irish government didn’t want me to go, the British government certainly didn’t want me to go. It was really hard, but nobody would say no.”
“I still remember, vividly, arriving at the Falls Community Center, the children outside with their flags, the sense of excitement of a community that was being recognized at last — it was as much as that. It was just incredible,” Robinson added.
Pierce said women ensured stability in Northern Ireland throughout The Troubles.
“It was women who, throughout the decades of violence in Northern Ireland, kept their families fed, kept them intact,” Pierce said. “They faced the burdens of poverty, domestic violence, single parenthood, even loss of housing because of the conflict.”
Verveer led a discussion panel following remarks from Varadkar and Pierce with Monica McWilliams, a lead negotiator in the Good Friday talks; Michelle O’Neill, the First Minister-designate of Northern Ireland; Liz O’Donnell, a former Minister of State of Ireland; and Robinson.
McWilliams said the anniversary of the agreement allowed her to reflect on the significance of the progress Ireland has seen over the last two and a half decades.
“There are people alive today that would not have been alive had we not made that Good Friday Agreement,” McWilliams said.
Verveer then invited four women to participate in a conversation with McWilliams: Avila Kilmurray, a social activist; Patricia O’Lynn and Emma Little-Pengelly, Northern Ireland legislators; and Emma DeSouza, a writer and activist.
Norms must be challenged for sustainable peace solutions to be effectively implemented in regions that have been impacted by conflict and violence, Clinton said.
“We don’t want to hear different opinions from people who we have already concluded are outside the pale of our comfort zone. You cannot run a society, let alone make peace for long, if that is your ingoing attitude,” Clinton said. “So we all have to do some serious soul-searching about how we relate to one another in this much more complicated information environment.”

A third Hoya this year had the chance to bring their knowledge from the cubicles of Lauinger Library to the “Jeopardy!” stage in an episode that aired March 15.
Gwen Lockman (COL ’16) finished third, taking home $1,000, despite a strong showing headed into the final round. Lockman joins the ranks of numerous Georgetown University community members who have appeared on the show, most recently including Patrick Curran (COL ’14, GRD ’19) and Caleb Richmond (SFS ’25). Lockman is an avid trivia player who majored in American studies at Georgetown and is currently pursuing a doctorate at the University of Texas at Austin — an academic background she said prepared her well for the wide array of categories she faced as a contestant.
Lockman said she initially looked into competing on the show when she was in high school, but only took the qualifying test after completing her undergraduate degree at Georgetown in 2016.
Though she was not selected to compete based on her initial test, she took it again in 2022 after playing recreational trivia and was chosen to participate in two further rounds of testing and auditions.
Before taking the test her second time, Lockman said she spent six months in Butte, Mont., where she played on two teams that competed in trivia nights at local bars and restaurants.
“Both teams did really well and I decided to try taking the test again after someone we played against urged our team to give it a shot,” Lockman wrote to The Hoya.
After hearing that she was selected, Lockman only had about a month to prepare for the wide array of trivia categories she faced on the show.
“Once I found out I was going on, I mostly did what I always do: watched the show, did crossword puzzles every day, and kept up on the news and pop culture,” Lockman wrote. “I didn’t want to psych myself out, though, and figured what I’d always done had gotten me far enough to get on the show.”
According to Lockman, trivia skills from her undergraduate tenure and doctoral work at UT Austin proved valuable.
“I’d say my focus on entertainment, leisure, and pop culture came in handy, through classes like Music and Dance in America 1938-1968, TV in American Society, Rock History, Baseball in American Society, and American Photography,” Lockman wrote. “But I also definitely learned a lot through the broad core in liberal arts and my minor in government.”
Lockman said having some performance experience helped her remain confident while filming.
“It was a ton of fun! I wasn’t really stressed when I was there,” Lockman wrote. “The crew and staff do everything to make sure contestants are having fun. It was cool to meet the other contestants and chat about our different backgrounds. I loved getting to see how TV is actually made.”
Lockman’s mother, Jamie Ryan Lockman, hosted a watch party for her daughter and attended the live taping of her daughter’s episode, recalling memories of their family bonding over the show.
“We often watched ‘Jeopardy!’ after dinner when Gwen was growing up,” Jamie Lockman wrote to The Hoya. “On long road trips (common in Montana!) we would pull the Trivial Pursuit questions to make the trip more fun.”
Richmond, who competed on the show last month, said he values being a member of the Georgetown Jeopardy network.
“It’s been amazing to see so many Hoyas competing on Jeopardy in the past few months,” Richmond wrote to The Hoya. “Everyone at Georgetown is here because they have this intense desire to learn more about the world we live in, and while that can be accomplished in infinite ways, it seems to often coincide with developing a knowledge base that’s useful on the Jeopardy stage.”
Jamie Lockman said she will think back fondly of her daughter’s time on the game show.
“I was very proud of her; she played a competitive game with poise and confidence,” Jamie Lockman wrote. “It will go down in our family history as a remarkable and fun memory!”

The last time Rebecca F. Kuang (SFS ’18) was in the ICC auditorium, she was a freshman taking an Economics exam. Eight years later, she’s giving a talk as a 26-year-old New York Times bestselling author in the same room.
Kuang joined Georgetown students March 15 for a conversation on her books and time at Georgetown.
The Georgetown University Lecture Fund, a non-partisan student organization that arranges forums and hosts speakers on a variety of topics, held the event in collaboration with the Georgetown English department and the GU Center for Research and Fellowships, which connects students and alumni to fellowships and research opportunities. Rhodes Scholar Atharv Gupta (SFS ’23) moderated the event, which included remarks by Kuang followed by a Q&A session.
Kuang specializes in epic fantasies, a genre defined by fictional settings and plots, characters and themes with an epic nature. Despite not pursuing creative writing in an academic setting, she said she has always been interested in writing fantasy stories.
“I just had always kept this weird, fictional diary,” Kuang said at the event. “Instead of chronicling things that were happening to me, I was writing about this fictional set of kids riding hoverboards in a post-apocalyptic world living in abandoned skyscrapers with some vague, dystopian, totalitarian government lurking in the background. I was basically writing fanfiction books about my own life.”
Kuang graduated from the School of Foreign Service as a Marshall Scholar, joining a cohort of talented American students selected each year to pursue graduate studies at a UK institution. After graduating from Georgetown in 2018, Kuang received her MPhil in Chinese Studies from Cambridge and MSc in Contemporary Chinese Studies from Oxford. She is currently pursuing a PhD in East Asian Languages and Literature at Yale University. 
At the event, Kuang said she came into Georgetown with the goal of working in politics or consulting, but her interactions with professors steered her toward other pursuits that better fit her skill sets.
“For the first few years, I kept pushing myself into fields that I just wasn’t good at, and trying and failing,” Kuang said. “But Georgetown offers you so much flexibility to change your path at any point on the pipeline, and I had incredible mentors.”
After a Georgetown professor encouraged her to take a gap year, Kuang spent a year in Beijing, where she wrote her first novel, “The Poppy War.” The first installment of a trilogy about empire, warfare and shamanism, “The Poppy War” is a Chinese-history inspired epic fantasy.
Kuang said much of the creative inspiration for her fantasy tales comes from her interpersonal struggles and family history.
“Everything was a parallel of the messy feelings I was having, and fabulation was just the most natural outlet for it all,” Kuang said. “If I’m feeling any very strong emotions, positive or negative, I immediately start thinking about how I can channel it into how a character is feeling.”
“I try to hold onto where my brain is going when I’m feeling deep grief, or frustration, or anger, and I put that into the project,” Kuang added.
Kuang said drawing from her own life experiences helps make the narratives she crafts within her epic fantasies more relatable to readers.
“That’s why they’re compelling, why the reader is so persuaded, even in scenes where dragons are battling in the sky,” Kuang said. “Something about that scene has to feel true.”
She also spoke on her experience as a minority student from a disadvantaged background attending an elite university, saying minority students should lean into discomfort as a way to flourish.
“Don’t try to therapize yourself out of that discomfort,” Kuang said. “That discomfort is really worth holding onto, and it’s something that ought to shape and inform every decision you make afterwards. Don’t be fooled into thinking that your presence at an elite institution is in itself radical.”
Kuang’s latest work, “Yellowface,” is a novel about a white writer parading as Asian-American. It is expected to be published this May.
Kuang said that regardless of her success thus far, her creative process is continuous.
“I treat each fiction project as a way to experiment, to expand my craft and learn to be a better writer than the Rebecca I was a year ago,” Kuang said. “It’s an ongoing process, and it didn’t happen at Georgetown, but it happened because of Georgetown.”

Former Senior White House leader Lynn Overmann started on March 6 her new role as executive director of Georgetown’s Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation, an organization which aims to equitably improve daily life through design, technology and policy, with years of government experience under her belt.
Overmann brings expertise in technology, policy and higher education to the role as well as plans to invest in her team and help improve the Beeck Center’s services. Overmann’s vision includes promoting a human-centered approach for individuals within and outside of the Center.
“One of the most important things a leader can do is understand who their team is and what they need, so a large part of my job is to support them,” Overmann told The Hoya. “So I’ve been doing that, and I’ve also been learning about the great work that’s already underway and finding ways that we may be able to grow beyond that work. The team is incredible.”
Overmann said the primary mission of the Beeck Center is to improve how people interact with government resources like student loan forgiveness, food stamps and unemployment assistance. 
“We interact with government every single day, even if folks don’t necessarily recognize it,” Overmann said. “What the Beeck Center does is we try to recognize those places. If we can bring data and technology and better design, it will make it easier for people on the other end of those services to access them.”
Overmann has held senior-level positions under Barack Obama’s and Joe Biden’s presidential administrations and most recently served as senior advisor for the United States Digital Service, a technology unit of the federal government, where she provided advice to federal officials, including U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice and U.S. Digital Service Administrator Mina Hsiang.
Overmann also said her previous experience as a public defender has shaped her perspectives in her professional life.
“The first ten years of my career were in direct services working with folks who were amongst the most vulnerable in our populations and were at risk of having things go really sideways in the criminal justice system,” Overmann said. “That experience has really stuck with me throughout my career. With the Beeck team, we talk about being human-centered, and everyone is.”
Adam Bobrow (COL ’94), the co-convenor of the Beeck Center’s Unemployment Insurance Tech Coordinating Coalition for the Digital Benefits Network, said he is excited about Overmann’s hire. Bobrow, who worked alongside Overmann in 2015 in the Office of Science and Technology Policy, a department of the federal government, is familiar with Overmann’s work.
“She has the experience in and out of government to understand how digital innovation can improve service delivery for government programs,” Bobrow wrote to The Hoya. “Lynn’s exceptional skills as an administrator and fundraiser will ensure Beeck continues to move from strength to strength.”
Ashleigh Fryer, the storyteller-in-residence and interim director of communications for the Beeck Center who has been developing content to amplify the Center’s narratives since 2021, said she is encouraged by Overmann’s commitment to storytelling.
“In a few short weeks, she’s shown herself to be a thoughtful and dynamic leader whose experience in the civic tech space is unrivaled,” Fryer wrote to The Hoya. “Her strategic vision and commitment to storytelling will help bring our work to new audiences and grow our impact on the lives of individuals utilizing the systems we aim to improve.”
Vinith Annam, a state chief data officers network program manager at the Beeck Center, said he believes that Overmann will push the Center to ask the right questions regarding ongoing projects. 
“As a Program Manager, I think Lynn will ask important questions and provide valuable suggestions that will improve our work and project outcomes,” Annam wrote to The Hoya. 
The Beeck Center announced on Feb. 22 that it had received over $11 million in funding to enhance its projects on the access and delivery of public safety net benefits. The funding came from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, The Families And Workers Fund, The Ford Foundation and the Beeck Family.
Overmann said that she enters her executive directorship with an understanding of the policy sphere, which overlaps with the human-centered approach to her work. 
“A really important lesson that has been learned in the policy world in the last 10 years is that getting the policy done is just the beginning of the story,” Overmann said. “We really need to be sure that we are delivering what is intended in those laws.”

Major League Cricket (MLC), a newly created American cricket league, announced the launch of the Washington Freedom, Washington, D.C.’s first professional cricket team.
The Washington Freedom, which the MLC revealed March 15, will compete alongside five other teams during the MLC’s inaugural season, which begins July 13. The newly constructed Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas will host all of the matches. 
Sanjay Govil, the lead investor for the Washington Freedom, and his son Avikar Govil said cricket fans in the District have historically been proactive about supporting up-and-coming teams.
“DC has, in my opinion, the most avid and loyal fan base in the country,” Govil wrote to The Hoya. “We are excited to draw on this passion as our team gets up and running. DC fans are also no strangers to getting behind new teams in the area. We’ve seen quite a few over the past few decades like the Mystics in ‘98, Nationals in ‘05 or Defenders in ‘18. Our fans are willing to give new teams a chance and wholeheartedly throw their support behind them.”
The MLC announced the launch of their inaugural summer 2023 season Nov. 15, 2022. The season will consist of 19 matches played over 18 days and will conclude with a championship final July 30. The league will play the Twenty20 (T20) format of cricket, a shortened variation that spans one day rather than the typical three to five days. 
MLC Tournament Director Justin Geale said the new league will expand cricket — a sport that is most popular in southern Asia and Australia — to an American audience.
“The launch of Major League Cricket will bring an American flavor to the world of cricket, and it’ll be fantastic to see the Washington Freedom take to the pitch representing the nation’s capital this summer,” Geale said in a March 14 press release.
Andries Gous, the first round draft pick for the Washington Freedom, played cricket professionally in South Africa for nine years before MLC contacted him and asked him to play in the United States.
Gous said he is excited about the opportunity to play for D.C. with a group of international players.
“It’s awesome to be part of the DC team this year,” Gous wrote to The Hoya. “We have a really good squad, and with some overseas players still getting announced, it will only get better.”
Gous is most looking forward to the high level of competition he will see during the MLC season.
“I am so excited to be playing with some of the best players in the world,” Gous wrote. “To compete with and against the top players in the world is probably for everyone the most exciting thing.”
The MLC draft, in which the six teams selected players from the United States and abroad, took place March 19 in Houston, Texas. The Washington Freedom drafted nine players, including one rookie, Akhilesh Bodugum.
Gous said that while playing with a new team takes some getting used to, he feels that the collaborative dynamic of the team will be strong since many of the players already know one another.
“The benefit of playing in a new team is every person brings a different kind of energy and tactics and skills, and because it is a new team you really want to do well,” Gous wrote. “The challenge is that you don’t always know your fellow players and it can take a couple of sessions to really gel as a group, but the good thing for us is that all our domestic players know each other well, so that will already be a big plus for us.”
Dane Piedt, a former South African cricketer who will also play for the Washington Freedom, said he and the other new players are being given the unique opportunity to shape the future of a team.
“We have the chance to create a culture and style of play that can be a part of the franchise for years to come,” Piedt wrote to The Hoya.
Justin Dill, a South African cricketer who has played in the United States for the past two years, said he is looking forward to learning from fellow players.
“It is such an honor to be a part of the Washington Freedom MLC Team,” Dill told The Hoya. “Being surrounded by such good players is going to be a great experience.”
Piedt said he never thought he would have the chance to play in the United States on a team like the Washington Freedom. 
“It’s a professional league that’s come to America and we are a part of it,” Piedt wrote. “Not in my wildest dreams did I think this would happen.”

Popular 1980s rock band Metallica acquired a majority stake in Furnace Record Pressing (Furnace), a record pressing plant in Alexandria, Va., on March 14. 
Furnace and Metallica have previously collaborated on several vinyl projects, including the creation of deluxe box set editions for Metallica’s most popular albums. Metallica’s success in these projects and Furnace’s ability to sustain the demands of the growing vinyl record market were driving factors in the new partnership, according to a March 14 Furnace press release.
Lars Ulrich, the co-founder of Metallica, said he is excited to partner with Furnace because of its commitment to high-quality pressing.
“We couldn’t be more happy to take our partnership with Furnace — and Eric, Ali and Mark specifically — to the next level,” Ulrich said in the press release. 
As one of the largest record pressing companies in the United States, Furnace produces over 25,000 records a day. Its 70,000 square-foot facility in Alexandria houses 14 presses and manufactures standard and heavyweight pressings, color vinyl, custom vinyl etching and special effect color vinyl.
In recent years, manufacturers have struggled to keep up with the growing demand for vinyl records; yearly vinyl album sales have increased consistently over the past 17 years. Consumers bought 43.46 million vinyl albums in 2022, a 4.2% increase from the previous year. Metallica sold over 900,000 vinyl records in 2022, with roughly half of those sales coming from the United States, according to Billboard magazine.
As such, Eric Astor, the founder and CEO of Furnace, said partnering with Metallica will provide Furnace with the opportunity for stability and future growth. 
“Building Furnace into the dedicated and experienced family of experts that it is today has been a huge effort, but immensely gratifying,” Astor said in the March 14 press release. “Knowing our long-term future is secured while also being better able to take advantage of growth opportunities is really exciting for every member of the Furnace staff.”
Ali Miller, Furnace’s chief operating officer, said the partnership also enables the company to maintain its customer-first approach.
“We have found ideal partners in Metallica,” Miller said in the March 14 press release. “They want us to continue our customer driven focus. To that end we look forward to providing even greater capacity and service to each of our customers in the future.”
James Hetfield, the co-founder of Metallica, said the relationship that Furnace has with Metallica fans and vinyl consumers is admirable.
“Furnace has been great to Metallica and more importantly to our fans,” Hetfield said in the March 14 press release. “This deepened relationship between Metallica and Furnace ensures that fans of vinyl everywhere, particularly our Fifth Members, will have continued access to high quality records in the future.”
Metallica plans to produce vinyls with Furnace for its new album, “72 Seasons,” which will be released April 14. The over 77-minute album, which delves into how childhood shapes people’s future selves, features 12 tracks. The album will be produced on black vinyl and two colored vinyl variations, according to a Nov. 28 press release.
Astor said the partnership with Metallica will not change Furnace’s commitment to supporting and producing indie records.
“Furnace is not turning into a Metallica only pressing plant,” Astor wrote to The Hoya. “Far from it. Our shared objective is to provide even more capacity to indie labels and bands, not less.”
Furnace leadership will remain in place and will continue to be equity owners of the company and members of the company’s board of directors, according to the press release. Astor said in the press release that the partnership will create some surface-level changes, but overall, Furnace will remain the same. 
“While the ownership structure is changing, under the hood, everything stays the same: the same people, same spirit, same culture and the same never-ending quest to perfect our craft,” Astor said.

The Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching & Service (CSJ) awarded Sarah Tyree (CAS ’24) and Miray Samuel (CAS ’25) on March 15 the Legacy of Erica Pincus scholarship, centered on community impact and leadership.
The scholarships, established in 2021, provide $2,000 each to two co-captains of the CSJ’s First-Year Orientation to Community Involvement (FOCI) pre-orientation program for incoming first-years. Tyree and Samuel will lead the program, which focuses on social justice and community service in D.C., during the Fall 2023 semester.
The award commemorates Erica Pincus (SFS ’13), a former FOCI leader and CSJ assistant program director who died in 2021. Pincus attended Stanford University and Harvard University after her graduation from Georgetown University and worked in the Obama White House.
Samuel, who participated in FOCI during her first year at the university and became a group leader her sophomore year, said she wanted to lead the program so that she could continue her involvement in a supportive on-campus community. 
“It was a space on campus to come together with a group of people that is both immensely diverse but also unified in its goals of wanting to learn, being willing to reflect and having a desire to intentionally work with the greater community around us,” Samuel wrote to The Hoya. “I’m excited to hopefully impact more incoming freshmen the way that the program impacted me.”
Tyree said working with the CSJ has allowed her to improve her leadership skills and meet people who share her values.
“Working in CSJ programs has connected me with lifelong friends and pathways for cultivating leadership and service with others,” Tyree wrote to The Hoya. “The CSJ emphasizes intentionality and consensus and has made me a more conscientious decision maker while also making me feel heard and respected as a part of a team.”
Tyree said the Erica Pincus scholarship would allow her to devote time to CSJ programs including FOCI while reducing the financial pressure of living in D.C. 
“The Pincus award graciously mitigates some of the financial burden and provides me the opportunity to dedicate my attention to the commitments that should be given more time and energy,” Tyree wrote. “Because the Erica Pincus award is named after a former co-captain, it also invokes my reflection on the FOCI program’s history and its legacy, and how I can help shape that as a co-captain.”
The CSJ also runs the Alternative Breaks Program (ABP), which allows students the opportunity to travel to various locations around the District and the United States during spring break. This year, students had the chance to travel to Nogales, Ariz.; Harlan, Ky.; and Detroit, Mich., among other places.
Samuel participated in an ABP trip in her first year at the university and was an ABP leader this year. Samuel said her time at the CSJ has influenced the way she views her academics and her plans post-graduation. 
“I feel like the work that I do with the CSJ impacts how I look at every aspect of my life — the ways in which I think about my classes and what I prioritize for my future,” Samuel wrote. “I can find people who are kind, interested in the people around them, and looking for connections with the community.”
Emily Diaz (CAS ’25) received the Legacy of Erica Pincus scholarship in 2022 and said receiving the award and leading the FOCI program allowed her to build a welcoming environment for first-year students.
“Through the people I met and the community that was built I knew I wanted to be part of forming that same feeling of love and acceptance for other first year students,” Diaz wrote to The Hoya. 
Diaz said the CSJ’s support has allowed her to fulfill her interest in social justice while being part of a strong community. 
“I have always had a passion for social justice and the CSJ has been a place of support where I am able to do this and go out of my comfort zone,” Diaz wrote. “The CSJ has helped me become a more well-rounded person and a Hoya for others at Georgetown.”
Samuel said she hopes to give incoming first-years the same space to explore social justice she received through FOCI.
“I am just one person who is also always continually learning about social justice and ways to better be in solidarity with others, and so my greatest hope beyond putting together a great program for FOCI is to allow others the opportunity to experience that solidarity, learn about the things they are passionate about, and find a community of like-minded people like I did,” Samuel wrote.
