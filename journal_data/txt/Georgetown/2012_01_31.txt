Over 80 years ago, William Francis Boland returned to his Germantown, Md., farmhouse with a painting that had been passed down through his family for generations.
The painting was the self-portrait of Boland’s maternal uncle, James Alexander Simpson, a Georgetown-born artist and the university’s first professor of drawing and painting.
In July 2009, it made one final move — to Georgetown to join the university’s art collection.
In December, the university announced that the 1847 self-portrait of Simpson, who was also responsible for the iconic Georgetown landscapes that adorn posters across campus, had been bequeathed to the university in 2009.
After a restoration process, it was recently hung with a new frame in the Special Collections reading room on the fifth floor of Lauinger Library. The university eventually plans to display it in Healy Hall’s Carroll Parlor, the main showroom for the university art collection.
A FAMILY AFFAIR
Over an evening at her townhouse in an adult living community in Silver Spring, Md., Ruth RamsdellStout, the 93-year-old granddaughter of Boland, worked through the details of the portrait’s ownership. After poring over a comprehensive family tree, dredging up old family stories with her son and nephew and making multiple phone calls to different cousins and sisters, Stout, the matriarch of the family, sifted out the ownership line of the portrait.
“It was always known as Uncle Simpson’s picture,” Stout said. James Simpson was her great-great-uncle through her maternal grandfather’s line.
According to Stout, the painting came into her branch of the family in Germantown when Boland picked up the portrait from members of the Simpson family, who were living in the Georgetown neighborhood in the early 1900s.
From Germantown, the painting moved to the top of the stairs of Stout’s childhood home inGaithersburg, Md. In one storied family tale, an in-law particularly taken by the painting stepped back to gather a better angle and tumbled all the way to the bottom of the stairs, eventually ending up in the hospital. She made a full recovery.
At one point, the portrait hung over the sofa in the living room of another home, where it appeared in family photos. Uncle Simpson was then placed over the mantle. He moved with families and passed through hands, ultimately ending up in the Riderwood Village community in Silver Spring, the last residence of Stout’s sister, Jane Ramsdell Frank, and her husband, Richard.
But the 2009 deaths of both Jane and Richard Frank left the painting in another period of transition.
“I called Ruth [Stout] and asked her, I said, ‘Who was the person in the picture?’ She said, ‘All I know is that it was Uncle Simpson,'” Justin Frank, Jane and Richard’s son, said. “I had to do something with it. Nobody wanted it.”
From there, Justin’s sister, Marcia Frank, a former archivist, found out that James Simpson had taught at Georgetown. After calling the university, the siblings were eventually led to the university’s art curator, LuLen Walker.
“We were thrilled,” Walker said.  “I didn’t know such a thing existed.”
THE MAN BEHIND THE LANDSCAPES
Not only did no one outside his family appear to know of his self portrait’s existence, but no one at Georgetown had ever even seen an image of James Simpson before.
“I didn’t have a clue what he looked like,” Walker said.
Simpson, who was born in 1805, is known largely in the university community for the five iconic landscape paintings of the campus he completed in the late 1820s and early 1830s. These are the same landscapes that hang in Carroll Parlor and the president’s office and whose prints decorate walls throughout campus and hang in the homes of scores of alumni.
“A portrait is an artwork, but it’s also a historical document,” Walker said.
Simpson made his mark on the regional art scene as well, primarily in portraiture. Currently two of his works are on display and a third is in storage at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.
A note in the university archives by Simpson dated Sept. 7, 1831, explained that one of the sunbeam-laced landscapes was painted precisely as the campus appeared at exactly 2 p.m. that day from the Trinity Church steeple (the church’s location was different from where it stands on N Street today), complete with cows grazing in an idyllic hillside pasture.
“The landscapes in Carroll Parlor are always everyone’s favorites, even though we have a van Dyckand a Luca Giordano,” Walker said.
Now the man behind those bright landscapes has his moment in the sun, as well.
“I think he did a really fine job,” Walker, who worked as a curator at the National Portrait Gallery for 10 years before taking up her current position in 1999, said.
“I see it as him proclaiming the peak of his artistic career and artistic success.”
The 1847 portrait did in fact come in the prime of Simpson’s career. He had already completed numerous commissioned portraits by that time and the year before had finished a reproduction of Gilbert Stuart’s famous portrait of Commodore Stephen Decatur for the naval hero’s widow.
A FACE REFRESHED
Simpson’s self portrait came to Georgetown in need of significant restoration and cleaning. Most notable was the fact that a decades-old L-shaped tear appeared near the middle of the painting, according to Stout.
Ann Creager, the art conservator charged with restoring the portrait, worked to mend it over a six-month period. She had a challenging task in repairing that tear, which had been poorly patched over using a piece of cloth and what she judged to be Elmer’s glue.
After addressing other restoration needs, Creager was able to begin cleaning away over 160 years of dirt, grime, varnish and more dirt. The six-month restoration project was completed in September 2011.
“I knew that painting was going to clean, and I knew it was going to be dramatic,” Creager says. “I knew I was going to make Georgetown happy cleaning it up.”
The university was more than excited.
“When I saw the painting on the easel I was just completely overwhelmed by how beautiful it looked,” Walker said. “It was like a whole new painting.”
The portrait is oil on canvas and features Simpson in full formal wear, standing at an easel with paint palette in hand. He is painting a portrait of an unknown woman and looking directly at the viewer, a confident look on his face, with a sketch book resting in the background.
Dabs of paint on the palette literally rise from the surface of the canvas.
“He really just saved himself for the palette,” Creager says. “It’s just like a palette would be.”
From Germantown to Gaithersburg and Upshur Street to McLean Gardens, from the top of the stairs to over the mantle to above the sofa and now to Lauinger Library, the painting has been guarded by one family after the next.
“This is your great-great grandmother’s brother you’re talking about,” Stout once scolded a son who jokingly suggested taking the portrait for appraisal at the Antiques Roadshow.
It is safe to say that now that Simpson is at Georgetown, he will be moving less often than before, certainly remaining in this family for some time.
“It felt as if [Creager] brought back to life a long-lost relative,” Walker said.
The version of this article that appeared in print on Jan. 27 mistakenly referred to Upshur Street asUpture Street. The article has been updated to reflect this change.

Making its platform clear through an advertising campaign that invites students to “become the one percent,” Trebizond Investments is working to distinguish itself from other campus investment groups.
Founded last year, the organization is the newest investment group at Georgetown and manages about $50,000.  According to CEO Caspian Tavallali (SFS ’14), it differs from larger and more established groups like the Georgetown Collegiate Investors and the Georgetown University Student Investment Fund in its focus on short-term investments.
“GCI and GUSIF invest like our grandparents do. They invest on the long term,” he said. “In reality, we’re in college for four years. Very few of these investments you’re making will … ripen by the time you graduate. We look at shortterm investments that we can make profits out of in maybe three months.”
Tavallali previously served as GCI’s secretary of the board and was actively involved in GUSIF.
Chief Operations Officer Alex Kondziolka (MSB ’14) said Trebizond also invests in higher risk funds and makes faster decisions than other investment groups on campus.
“We see opportunity and take it. In that way, [our] investment rationale is more risky,” Tavallali said. “But as young adults, we can take that risk.”
Tavallali added that the organization was also unique  in its structure.
“Many of our members have little investment experience, but they have the opportunity to pitch investment ideas in front of peers,” he said. “That makes the investment less paternalistic, because no one is being lectured to.”
Both Tavallali and Kondziolka emphasize participation as the most valuable asset of the club. The group also prides itself in the use of a secret ballot when it makes investment decisions, according Chief Investment Officer Eric Vorchheimer (MSB ’14).
“A lot of times when you do open voting, you would either get almost 100 percent ‘yes’ or 100 percent ‘no,’ because when the CEO raises his hand, other people tend to just follow,” Tavallali said. “It becomes investing under peer pressure, and that’s not good investment strategy.”
Trebizond Investments also uses an online investing forum, which allows for a transparent log of investment rationale and creates a system of accountability.
“Even people who are not club members can see our rationale,” Tavallali said, “So people have more responsibility when pitching.”

The Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E voted 6-1 in favor of a document condemning Georgetown’s 2010 Campus Plan at its monthly meeting Monday night.
The document was drafted by the Burleith Citizens Association and the Citizens Association of Georgetown, and presented at the ANC’s last meeting before the D.C. Zoning Commission rules on the Campus Plan Feb. 9.
“The Commission finds that the growth in enrollment and the consequent number of student group houses have created objectionable conditions in adjoining communities,” the resolution read.
It went on to assert that the university’s efforts, including implementation of the Student Neighborhood Assistance Program, construction of the Southwest Quad and expanded shuttle service on weekends, have failed to meet neighbors’ expectations for resolving divisive issues.
“The Commission concludes that the [university] has not met its burden of showing that the proposed Campus Plan is not likely to become objectionable due to noise, traffic, number of students or other objectionable conditions and will not tend to affect adversely the use of neighboring property,” the document read.
The single dissenting vote on the resolution came from Jake Sticka (COL ’13), the sole student representative on the commission. Sticka added that debate over the decision to ratify the document was not contentious because each commissioner’s stance on the issue has long been clear.
“It’s a year now since that initial debate [on the Campus Plan], so at this point it’s not really contentious. It’s something I disagree with the commissioners on,” he said.
ANC Chairman Ron Lewis, who voiced concern that the university has failed to understand neighborhood concerns, also expressed his relief that the long debate on the Campus Plan is coming to a close.
“I think we’re all very eager to have the Zoning Commission make a decision,” he said.
The issue of food trucks in the neighborhood was also a prominent item on Monday night’s agenda. Popular among students, mobile food vendors have irritated residents who claim they park on residential streets.
Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs Director Nicholas Majett attempted to address the concerns of both business owners and residents.
“It’s very difficult for us to strike a balance between [the interests of] brick-and-mortar [establishments] and vending trucks,” he said.
The commissioners subsequently passed a motion prohibiting food trucks from parking on streets designated as residential parking permit streets, which make up large portions of Georgetown.
The board also addressed the repairs currently underway on O and P Streets. Commissioner Jeff Jones said that the work on the 3400 block of P Street is nearing completion. The rehabilitation will include the replacement of original cobblestones and streetcar tracks in order to preserve the historic character of the area.
The project is projected to be completed in February, one month later than had been announced at the ANC’s Dec. 1 meeting.

Until the beginning of his senior year, few of Armen Avagyan’s (COL ’10) friends knew that he was just 17 years old when he matriculated at Georgetown as a sophomore.
“I liked being younger with nobody else knowing,” he said. “No one had any idea I was younger and everything was fine.”
That all ended at Senior Disorientation, when the then 19-year-old was given a differently colored wristband from his drinking-age friends.
“As soon as people started noticing it was less enjoyable,” he said. “People … treat you differently.”
 
A Class Apart
Avagyan, who grew up and went to high school in Armenia, moved to the United States when he was 15. Once here, he decided that he wanted to move directly on to college, and an adviser from the University of Maryland helped him to apply to community colleges.
He transferred to Georgetown after spending his first year of college at Montgomery College in Rockville, Md.
Avgayan is just one of a small number of students who began attending Georgetown at a younger-than-traditional age.
Santhia Varatharajah (COL ’14), who finished high school in three years, is about two years younger than most of her classmates.
According to Varatharajah, it was common knowledge among students that there was a 16-year-old freshman in the class of 2014. People would ask her what she thought about it and express their own negative opinions on having someone so young in their class. None of them knew that she was the 16-year-old student they were talking about.
“I heard stories straight to my face about what people thought of it,” she said. “I don’t want people to think of me that way.”
These negative reactions compelled Varatharajah to act older, never giving anyone a reason to suspect that she was two years younger than her classmates.
Avagyan had a similar mentality.
“If you do something crazy and stupid and you’re their age they think its okay, but if you do something crazy and stupid and they know you’re younger [they won’t],” he said.
Still, these students find that there are many situations in which simply acting older is not enough.
According to Wardah Athar (COL ’13), who received her Georgetown acceptance letter when she was 16, being younger has affected her ability to apply for scholarships and jobs.
“Something that’s sometimes tough is applying for internships where they’re looking for someone a little bit older,” Athar said.
Under the Radar
According to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon, young applicants to Georgetown are few and far between. Most students who deviate from the standard applicant age tend to be older than the typical 17 or 18 years rather than younger.
In the rare circumstance that a particularly young applicant does show up, his or her age weighs heavily in the acceptance process.
“The younger the student, the more the question will be looking at the student’s maturity and ability to move into an older setting,” he said.
But the Office of Undergraduate Admissions does not keep track of admitted students’ birthdates, meaning that it is easy for younger-than-traditional students to go unnoticed once accepted.
“They could be slightly invisible. Unless you focused in on the age it wouldn’t be apparent,” he said.
 
Looking Forward
Despite the challenges of starting college earlier than their peers, younger students find that their position has some perks.
Avagyan pointed to the fact that he was able to start his job application process almost two years ahead of anyone his age.
“You graduate early, you get a job early,” he said.
Avagyan graduated from Georgetown as a math and economics double major with honors. He now works with a government subcontractor as a research analyst while attending graduate school for math at Georgetown.
Athar, who will soon begin applying for M.D./Ph.D. programs, appreciates that her age makes her stand out among other applicants. Although she will be only 20 years old when she begins her graduate school application process, Athar’s resume will speak for itself.
Though these students are reluctant to admit it, their academic records and achievements are remarkable.
Varatharajah has assumed leadership positions in several campus groups, where even now few people know her true age. A few years ago she also co-wrote a bill for Congress with her father about the economic recession and illegal immigration.
Meanwhile, Athar works in the Donoghue Laboratory on campus researching cortical development. She also won the McTighe prize, a Georgetown award honoring community involvement, in spring 2011.
Despite her accomplishments, Varatharajah prefers to focus on the day-to-day reward of being at Georgetown.
“The biggest benefit of coming to Georgetown at 16 is identical to that of all university students:  college is a great place that people never want to leave,” she said.

A recent decision by the Department of Justice will allow universities to monitor labor conditions in factories producing school apparel.
Schools that are members of the Designated Suppliers Program, which was approved in December, will work to develop licensing terms that reflect fair labor standards. All apparel produced in the plants that accept the terms will contain a label that clearly outlines the workers’ labor conditions.
The program will largely mirror Georgetown’s relationship with Alta Gracia, an apparel line that uses a Dominican factory that pays its employees three times more than the minimum wage in the Dominican Republic, where the factory is located.
“The goal of this project is to create workable means so that a factory can operate while providing safe working conditions, the right to organize and a living wage, so the workers can make it in life and the factory can still be viable,” said Scott Fleming, Associate Vice President for Federal Relations and Public Affairs and interim chair of Georgetown’s Licensing Oversight Committee.
Fleming hopes the program will inspire the creation of more factories like Alta Gracia.
“I can’t help but believe that hopefully there is some way that having the DSP may help the financial viability of Alta Gracia,” he said.
The push was spearheaded by the Worker Rights Consortium, of which Georgetown was a founding member. The group was founded in 2000 in response to student and university requests that school apparel be made free of sweatshop labor and includes more than 180 colleges, universities and high schools.
Through the committee, the university has worked to ensure Georgetown apparel is made without sweatshop labor and has aided the WRC in gaining approval for the new program.
Though the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division concluded that the proposed program follows U.S. antitrust law, the WRC cannot demand general licensing standards.
Instead, the program aims to offer something like a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval to factories that uphold a school’s designated labor standards, according to Fleming.
The WRC will be responsible for monitoring factories that participate in the program and reporting conditions to the member schools, a process that is supposed to foster an open dialogue between the consumers, companies and workers.
Fleming said that he isn’t sure what the Designated Suppliers Program’s effect will be on the Georgetown University Bookstore, which already sells Alta Gracia products.
He admits that the success of the program depends on consumers’ willingness to purchase materials from these factories.
“We are here because the consumers of these products want this, and they are the ones who have gotten universities to establish these policies,” he said.

The Department of Public Safety reported 48 crimes this month, a 71 percent increase from the same period last year.
While January 2012 saw fewer crimes than October 2011 and November 2011, the month saw significant spikes in the number of burglaries, thefts, drug violations and overall crime compared to last January, when 28 incidents were reported.
But compared to previous months this school year, reported crimes declined. The total number of crimes dropped from 58 in November, representing a 21 percent decrease, part of which may be due to the fact that dorms were closed for the first 10 days of the month. Data from December is not comparable because campus was closed for the holidays.
Unlike most crimes, burglaries did not decline this month; there were nine burglaries reported in January, compared to three in November.
One of the nine burglaries involved the theft of 50 cartons of cigarettes from a Vital Vittles storeroom Jan. 23. This is the third burglary to take place at the convenience store since Dec. 1, and the case is one of seven incidents this month turned over to the Metropolitan Police Department for investigation.
One of the remaining cases, a Jan. 1 drug violation that did not involve Georgetown students, was closed with an arrest. An incident in which DPS discovered a substance containing methamphetamine in an LXR Hall dorm room Jan. 19 is still being investigated by MPD.
One case of disorderly conduct, in which students were accused of violating D.C.’s noise ordinance, resulted only in a warning to the subjects, while another case, in which students were found to be uncivil toward GERMS staff, was referred to the Office of Student Conduct.
The 23 remaining cases are still pending investigation.

Amanda Carlton, an administrator at the University of California, Berkeley, will become the adviser for the Student Activities Commission and associate director of student programs on Feb. 15.
Carlton, who serves as interim director of UC Berkeley’s Center for Student Leadership, will replace Bill McCoy, who left the university in August to become director of the Office of LGBT Awareness atBucknell University.
While Carlton will fill a position that has been vacant since the beginning of the year, another post in the Center for Student Programs opened last week when Assistant Director of Student Programs Kathryn Kay left to become director of orientation and leadership at the University of Utah. Kay had also served as the adviser for New Student Orientation, the Lecture Fund and the Graduate Student Organization at Georgetown.
“It’s been a little tough, but everyone’s just working a little harder and giving more of a time commitment to help the office transition,” SAC Chair Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) said of the CSP personnel changes.
Appelbaum participated in the search process that resulted in Carlton’s hiring.
“We really liked the experience Carlton had dealing with a lot of difficult issues at Berkeley,” he said. “She impressed us with her knowledge of leadership, funding allocation and a lot of issues that student groups face.”
Carlton was chosen by an eight-person committee comprised of three students and five faculty members.
Appelbaum is confident that Carlton will be a strong asset to the CSP.
“We’ll expect a little bit of a learning curve, but I have confidence that she’ll pick up immediately and help student groups when she gets to campus,” he said.
Director of Student Affairs Erika Cohen-Derr also believes that Carlton’s arrival will benefit Georgetown.
“Amanda Carlton has the right combination of experience, talent and professional philosophy to support student learning through co-curricular involvement in an academically engaging, diverse campus community,” she wrote in an email.
