Director of the Drug Discovery Program at the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center Milton Brown received the annual Percy L. Julian Award for his work in new drug discovery and testing against molecular targets on Nov. 1.
The National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers presented Brown with the award, the organization’s highest honor.
Brown is currently testing several drugs through clinical trials at Lombardi Center’s Drug Discovery Program, which develops therapeutic discoveries into preclinical studies. Brown founded the program in 2006. In the past, he has tested drugs for cancer, epilepsy, hypertension and kidney disease.
Brown graduated from Oakwood University with a degree in biology and received both his doctorate and post doctorate from the University of Virginia, where he taught until 2006. In 2008, Georgetown named him the Edwin H. Richard and Elizabeth Richard von Matsch Endowed Chair for Experimental Therapeutics, a program that seeks to reduce cancer through drug development and the discovery of treatment approaches.
President of the NOBCChE Talitha Hampton commended Brown’s leadership skills, creative spirit and scientific expertise.
“We believe that people like Dr. Brown embody the innovative entrepreneurial spirit that comes with breakthrough science and not only is Dr. Brown doing breakthrough science but he’s mentoring people and reaching back and all of those things combined are what make him such a strong candidate where he’s not just a scientist or an M.D.-Ph.D., he’s a fervent leader,” Hampton said. “His success is really an accomplishment.”
Brown said that he will continue his research and experimentation with potentially life-saving drugs, highlighting his strengths in the field.
“Everyone has their niche and I guess my niche is discovering new medicine,” Brown said.
Brown also commented on the impact of the award on both current and potential Georgetown students, expressing hope that it would encourage them to see the university as a viable research institution. Brown is currently a professor of molecular and cellular biology, oncology, neuroscience, pharmacology and physiology.
“Seeing my students attain success is probably the most rewarding part of the experience,” Brown said. “I’ve had a number of students who were even at the awards ceremony or following it online, on Twitter, who have decided to join Georgetown, to come here and work in my group and come look at my teaching.”
Hampton said that Brown serves as an inspiration for students wishing to pursue drug discovery.
“A student coming up himself can look at Dr. Brown and say I can do that because of what I’ve seen and everyone has a story to tell,” Hampton said. “And when you hear his story, many times students can see themselves in Dr. Brown and then they’ll just feel encouraged to take it a little step further.”
In determining the recipient of the award, NOBCChE also took into account 2014 winner Cato Laurencin’s recommendation. Laurencin expressed admiration for Brown and emphasized the ways in which he fulfilled the qualities embodied in the award.
“He’s a great scientist, a great mentor and a great role model for many people. He’s the perfect person to receive the Percy Julian Award and Medal,” Laurencin said. “Percy Julian was a persistent scientist and dauntless in his pursuit of excellence. I think that Dr. Brown is much like that.”
Lombardi Center Director Louis Weiner similarly praised Brown’s forward thinking.
“In my view, that’s where his greatest strengths have been. He’s interested and capable of taking molecules all the way forward,” Weiner said. “It’s hard to do.”
One of Brown’s Ph.D. mentees Antoinette Cordova (GRD ’15) worked on her breast cancer thesis under his guidance. Cordova praised Brown’s aptitude as a mentor.
“He could give me advice on the project from a chemical perspective, from a biological perspective, from a perspective therapy later down the line in the clinic,” Cordova said. “When you first start off a Ph.D. program, you’re kind of venturing into new territory. And, you really need someone to kind of push you and guide you into really believing in your ideas and going for it. He is excellent at doing that.”
Brown also mentored Perrer Tosso (GRD ’14) for six years at both the University of Virginia and Georgetown. Tosso stressed Brown’s instrumental influence in guiding his career path.
“He helped me in my training as a chemist and also to have a comprehensive view of traditional chemistry,” Tosso said. “Those years I spent with him, he helped me grow not just as a scientist but also as a person as well and I really appreciate that.”

It is those scientists like DR Brown that makes our scientific research forward. More Scientists like Dr Brown should be supported and awarded for their contributions.

Cost-information website howmuch.net released a report based on the Bureau of Economic Analysis 2014 statistics indicating that Washington, D.C.’s economic growth lags behind other major U.S. metropolitan areas on Nov. 18.
The report analyzed 381 metro areas and found that the gross domestic product grew in 282 of them. The professional and business services sectors accounted for 27 percent of GDP growth in 314 of the 381 areas.
In the report’s ranking of 10 cities by growth in GDP, the D.C. metro area ranked lowest with a 0.3 percent growth rate. The Dallas and San Francisco metro areas came in the top spots with 8.5 percent and 5.2 percent growth rates, respectively.
Director of Research at the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce Jeff Strohl said that D.C. has done fairly well through the recessionary period. He added that the city is known for having a strong labor market with high incomes, high earnings and low unemployment.
“For the growth rate to slow down a little bit in the face of some restrictions in government spending doesn’t actually come off as that surprising,” Strohl said. “I wouldn’t make too much hay out of that.”
However, Strohl said that D.C.’s low ranking in comparison to the growth rates of other large metro areas should not be of serious concern and said that economic statistics are often relative in nature.
“There have been indications in the past that the D.C. area will slow down with decreases in government and military spending,” Strohl said. “The D.C. labor market was fairly stable during the recessionary period. D.C. didn’t decline a lot, but it’s also not going to grow a lot.”
Strohl also stressed the importance of D.C.’s economic stability during the recession. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2008 and 2009, the District’s unemployment rates averaged around 5.8 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively. The national average was 9.9 percent during the same period.
“The D.C. metro area has had some of the lowest unemployment rates in the country during the recession. Now we are moving into recovery and economic growth is starting to spurt off elsewhere,” Strohl said. “Relative to those places that are doing really well Washington is doing relatively well.”
Strohl argued that the main factor contributing to the D.C. metro area’s slow economic growth is decreased government spending.
“Uncertain government spending is what really causes the problem,” Strohl said. “You don’t know when to make investments and this begins to affect stuff. Growth can be impacted just as much by uncertainty as actual declines in spending.”
Strohl said that because Georgetown students often navigate a national job market after graduation, the local economy is not as significant to job search success as it may initially seem.
“Georgetown and its graduates should fare fairly well,” Strohl said. “People apply to Georgetown from Vermont to California and its graduates do that same thing when looking for jobs.”
Andrew Yan (COL ’16) said that he was not concerned about the impact of the city’s low economic growth on his career prospects after graduation and added that GDP is not a fully accurate means of determining economic growth.
“I don’t believe that GDP is a reliable indicator of how well any area is doing,” Yan said. “It is much more important to look at employment rates for young people and the availability of actual paid opportunities.”
Christi DeSimone (COL ’16) echoed Yan’s sentiments, expressing the belief that GDP figures have little relevance to her career search.
“I’m just trying to get into an industry,” DeSimone said. “Maybe my opinion would vary if I was looking for a paid position. If I was going to a market that incorporated more investment or finance, it might matter more. But as far as I know, for my friends who are going into investment banking, I don’t think GDP has really affected them at all.”

The Office of the University Registrar is evaluating alternative options for replacing Georgetown’s current class registration system by February 2017, including changing the current pre-registration system to a live registration program.
Georgetown University Student Association’s Outreach Committee organized a town- hall discussion on the future of Georgetown’s registration system in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room last night. University Registrar John Q. Pierce spoke about the two potential systems and fielded questions from around 30 students for over an hour.
Georgetown currently has a registration system where students pre-register for classes before they finalize their registration. In a live registration system, all students would register for classes at the same time and learn their results instantly.
The re-evaluation of Georgetown’s registration system was spurred by the need to upgrade the current registration software system, which was introduced in 2009.
The university has the option to upgrade from the current registration software system, a product of Ellucian Higher Education called Banner 8, to a newer system, Banner 9. Banner 9 would include a number of changes from the current software, most prominently the introduction of the live registration system without a pre-registration period.
The university’s second option is to purchase an entirely new student registration system from Workday, the company that currently provides Georgetown’s human resources and finance software. The Workday system — which is still under development — would include a pre-registration system.
Georgetown has signed on as a partner for the Workday development program and will have substantial input into the company’s new student registration software.
Implementing the Workday system would be a major financial investment for the university in comparison to upgrading from Banner 8 to Banner 9. When the university last purchased student registration software in 2009, the software cost the university $17 million.
Pierce said he believes that upgrading to Banner 9 would incur a number of fiscal and convenience benefits for the university.
“We think the [Banner 9] registration process might be actually better; it would facilitate the mobile app, and if we went to cloud computing where we didn’t have to invest so much money in it … it would cost less to maintain it and thus keep tuition dollars down,” Pierce said.
GUSA representatives originally raised the possibility of eliminating the pre-registration system with university administrators last year but have since changed their stance on the issue.
“[GUSA] started having some conversations with students and found that their sense of what students wanted was not actually shared with everybody, and I would say what happened this year is the active students now believe that we should keep pre-registration,” Pierce said.
According to GUSA Outreach Committee Chair and Henle Village Senator Richie Mullaney (COL ’18), GUSA has considered the possibility of implementing a student-body referendum on the pre-registration issue to further gauge student opinion.
“We’re still learning about the potential changes, but [a student referendum] is absolutely a possibility in order to send a message to the administration about what students think, whatever that may be,” Mullaney said. “We’re exploring different ways to gauge student opinion because this affects every single student in a fundamental way.”
Mullaney said that student input on the issue of registration is important and stressed the necessity of communication between the student body and administrators.
“GUSA’s role at this early point in this conversation is to facilitate an honest transparency and communication between the registrar’s office and the student body,” Mullaney said. “GUSA really wants to inform the students of what’s happening and also gauge student opinion so the administration doesn’t make any decisions without knowing exactly what the students think.”
Many students at the town hall expressed worry about the effects of losing the pre-registration period with the Banner 9 software and having to compete heavily for courses against fellow students. Sarah Alshawi (COL ’18) said she enjoys the current pre-registration system due to its emphasis on comprehensive research for classes.
“I personally have had a decent amount of success with it. I like the fact that you can rank your preferences and also put alternates,” Alshawi said. “I think the way the system is set up encourages you to look at all of your options and really go through the course catalogue and see all of the courses that are offered to you.”
Other students expressed concern that a live registration process in place of a pre-registration period could make it more difficult to register for required courses and increase the possibility of falling off a four-year graduation track.
Edom Tesfa (SFS ’18) failed to register for “Problem of God” her first three semesters and was finally enrolled in the course this semester. She credits the pre-registration period for her current enrollment.
“Had I gone through live registration, I probably would not have gotten into the course, especially since the professor has reasonably high demand,” Tesfa said. “I work, I take intensive Chinese and I just don’t have that many options to take required courses. I would have been at risk of not graduating on time had this happened multiple times.”
Pierce said maintaining a strong four-year graduation rate remains a primary goal of the registration system and the registrar’s office.
“The underlying purpose of our job creating the schedule of classes and running registration is to see that particularly the students in the four traditional undergraduate schools graduate in four years. That’s one of our claims to fame, that’s one of the issues that keeps [Georgetown] ranked highly, that’s one of the reasons your parents are paying us all this money to educate you,” Pierce said.
Off-Campus GUSA Senator Eric Henshall (COL ’16) said he was surprised that student opinion at the town hall seemed so strongly in favor of keeping the pre-registration period.
“I think it was interesting to see that a lot of the students in the room like pre-registration, because I know there’s often a lot of angst especially this time of year when results are coming out. … And so I think that shows that students really do like the ability to prioritize their classes and then have the option to do pre-registration completion in December,” Henshall said.
Alshawi said that while it is disappointing that the registration system might change, the consultation process has been beneficial.
“I was unpleased that things potentially will get worse, but I was relieved that there does seem to be a lot of thought being put into it and that the students’ concerns about how much the system represents them is being taken into account,” Alshawi said.

Why exactly does the current registration need to be updated? I feel like that’s a question that nobody really asked. If it’s merely to add mobile app capability, that’s a waste of money. Registering for courses should be done carefully, on a computer, instead of swiping through this important process like one swipes through their social media feed. What is wrong with the current system and why do we need to spend millions (!) to change it? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.

Considering the yak feed I see from GW about students going crazy trying to get required courses for their majors with live registration, I would be really fucking pissed if Georgetown switches to live registration for matters of cost alone. Preregistration works beautifully and it gives me time to carefully consider what classes I want to take. It also makes sure that the students within each class are those who most need it, not the ones who happened to have the biggest stretch of free time.

College '16 says 
December 11, 2015 at 8:17 pm
When I was abroad I lived in apartment with American students from many other schools. Comparing my pre-registration experience with their live registration fully convinces me that pre-registration saves students a lot of angst. Despite the fact that these abroad students needed to be up at 3am to complete this, many of them fretted for days about not getting courses they would need to graduate and seemed stressed by the race-to-register days ahead of time. Pre-registration let’s you do your research and, most importantly, it’s NOT first come first serve. Whatever algorithms we’ve been using before seem to be doing a pretty good job and Registration allows time to fix any errors that the automatic process may have made. 
Long story short: Absolutely keep pre-registration
[…] “We think the [Banner 9] registration process might be actually better; it would facilitate the mobile app, and if we went to cloud computing where we didn’t have to invest so much money in it … it would cost less to maintain it and thus keep tuition dollars down,” Pierce said in an interview with The Hoya.  […]

The Institute of Politics and Public Service announced its spring 2016 class of fellows yesterday — IPPS’ second class of fellows — consisting of five prominent figures from the realms of politics, government and the media.
The new fellows include former Mayor of Jacksonville, Fla., Alvin Brown, former President of Costa Rica Laura Chinchilla (GRD ’89), former Deputy White House Political Director and Special Assistant to the President Patrick Dillon (COL ’99), Senior Politics Editor for The Daily Beast Jackie Kucinich and former Deputy Campaign Manager for Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign for president Katie Packer.
The fellows will begin a semester-long term at Georgetown in which they will participate in on-campus discussions, hold office hours for students and lead weekly discussions on relevant political topics and domestic and international events.
The IPPS Fellows Program, an initiative launched by the McCourt School of Public Policy, began with its first class of fellows in August 2015. Executive Director of IPPS Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) said the fellows program is an important way in which IPPS improves political discourse on campus and engages with the Georgetown community.
“The fellows program is really the cornerstone of GU Politics. Each semester we bring five practitioners who live in the trenches of politics and public service to do two things: 1) pull back the curtain of politics and help students understand how our political system really works, and 2) engage students to find ways to make it work better,” Elleithee wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“We had an amazing first class of fellows, and we’re particularly psyched about this one.”
Elleithee said that the diversity of each fellow’s background will allow for greater impact on the Georgetown community.
“This mix of professionals, which includes a foreign head of state, a big city mayor, a top political journalist, a White House official who has also helped run a state and a top Republican campaign operative is going to allow students to really dive into politics from a bunch of different angles,” Elleithee wrote. “We can’t wait for them to get here.”
Chief of Staff to the Office of the President Joe Ferrara said that the new class of fellows will continue to contribute to IPPS’ overall goal of finding solutions to make American politics more efficient.
“We congratulate the McCourt School on a terrific new class of fellows at the Institute of Politics and Public Service. This innovative program connects students with leaders in politics, government and media to engage together to make American politics work better,” Ferrara wrote in an email to The Hoya.
IPPS fellows will engage with the Georgetown community directly through discourse and collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students. Students may apply to join “student strategy teams” that will be formed by IPPS for each individual fellow in order to contribute to research and campus outreach. Students on the strategy teams will also participate in a “political hackathon” in the spring to come up with groundbreaking political ideas.
An in-depth profile of each IPPS fellow will appear in a future issue of The Hoya.

The Students of Georgetown, Inc., the Georgetown University Student Association, the Georgetown Alumni Association, the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union, the Office of the Provost and the Office of the President contributed to the funding of a temporary house for students in unstable living situations for the upcoming winter break.
The initiative will provide 10 students a secure space to live and sleep throughout the winter holiday through the community marketplace Airbnb. This temporary housing is normally provided by direct funding from the Georgetown Scholarship Program, but student groups and administrative bodies stepped in to reallocate the GSP funding to other programs. The Corp donated $4,500 for the house while GUSA and GUASFCU both donated $500 each. Upon hearing about donations from student groups, GUAA contributed $1,000 along with the President’s Office, and the Provost’s Office donated $2,000.
GSP was founded in 2004 by the Office of Admissions to offer resources and community for students who receive scholarships and financial aid and first-generation college students to facilitate academic, extracurricular and social success at Georgetown. There are approximately 150 GSP-affiliated student in each class year at Georgetown and over 600 GSP alumni.
When an average of six to 12 students — regardless of their affiliation with GSP — requested a need for housing over winter break in the past, GSP contributed the funding necessary to ensure the needs of those students were met. This funding typically came from the GSP Necessity Fund, which consists of outside donations.
GSP then distributed grants to students in need and helped them obtain winter break accommodations. Those students did not have a dedicated house at which to stay , so they stayed at hotels or at the houses of fellow GSP students during winter break.
In September 2014, GSP Program Director Missy Foy (COL ’03) realized more should be done to ensure students with uncertain housing situations could be secure in the long term.
“I knew in our heart we weren’t doing enough,” Foy said. “We needed to do something more institutionalized and formal, less disorganized.”
Foy soon discovered Airbnb, a community marketplace allowing individuals to list and book personal accommodations. Foy saw Airbnb as a viable and cost-effective way to make sure students could have adequate accommodation and began using the service in 2014.
“The one we rent is in Woodley Park. It’s downtown, right near a metro, and for a lot of the students … the location is convenient. Students appreciate being placed all together,” Foy said.
While others advocated for students to live in dormitories during the break, Foy believed the short-term solution with Airbnb was more viable and conducive for both the students and the university.
“The benefit of Airbnb is that it is cheaper than a hotel and it provides all of the amenities,” Foy said. “And we’re going to push the administration to have two students stay in Harbin, one student stay in Village B, three students in Henle? That’s hardly ideal.”
Foy said The Corp’s Social Impact Chair and GSP member Harrison Williams (COL ’16) approached her during the summer. Williams heard of GSP helping fund student housing during winter break with its own funds and expressed a desire to involve The Corp.
“After seeing some of the things that [Foy] had to go through to receive funding for the program, I wanted to help out in any way that I could to make the process easier for the following year,” Williams wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I reached out to [Foy] and I told her that I really wanted The Corp to get involved in any way that we could to support this initiative.”
GUSA President Joseph Luther (COL ’16) said Foy and Williams approached him about funding, so he began to reach out and organize community groups to secure donations to alleviate much of the burden from GSP.
“We reached out to GUSA over the summer to talk about the house and other ways that we could help GSP’s mission,” Luther wrote in an email to The Hoya. “After a lot of discussion, we saw the best role GUSA could play would be to raise awareness and appeal to different offices for funding.”
Chief of Staff to the President’s Office Joe Ferrara said his office was happy to contribute after seeing student-led initiative on the issue.
“The President’s Office is always happy to partner with student groups and other administrative offices to advance important work across the university,” Ferrara wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We were happy to help with a financial contribution. We appreciate the positive initiative to address important needs in our community.”
Foy said that the alternative source of funding is noteworthy, as it allows GSP to allocate resources to other programs and as the initiative was student-led.
“Going from $10,000 to $3,000 makes a huge difference. There was a cobbled together solution last year, and the important thing this year was the student support behind it, which helped the administration see this as a student priority,” Foy wrote.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson praised the work of each group and said he looks forward to future discussion of the issue.
“I am pleased that students and administrators have come together to support this opportunity for students,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I know it meets a need, and am encouraged by the collaboration that has gone into this.”
While the funding and involvement of student groups and administrative bodies has drawn praise, many still see future challenges. Luther said housing students with Airbnb is effective in the short term, but that the university should consider more long-term solutions.
“Our main goal at the moment is to institutionalize the program so in years to come the funding isn’t so ad hoc,” Luther wrote. “There are plenty of hurdles students from low socioeconomic backgrounds face and while the winter house is a great step forward, there is still much work to be done.”
Williams said there is a necessity for greater attention in the community to students in need.
“As we encourage more dialogue around the topic of socioeconomic status on campus, we must also start to push tangible projects and initiatives that the Georgetown community should all take on together, rather than placing the onus entirely on the back of the Georgetown Scholarship Program and a few concerned students,” Williams said.
Going forward, GSP is continuing to look for a long-term, institutional solution for students seeking housing during both winter breaks and other long holiday breaks.
Foy said that an additional solution is to reach out to local D.C. hotels for accommodation, but stressed that the ideal solution would be for the university to establish a designated house for students in unstable situations to occupy.
“A variety of spaces could serve our students’ needs, including the [Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center],” Foy wrote. “But if I had a magic wand … my dream of dreams would be that the university dedicated space that is open for necessity type situations.”
GSP member Jonathan Ulmer (COL ’18) said Georgetown should be proud of the collective action of many community members to recognize the situation of low-income students.
“This is so important not only because of the people it helps, but because of the message it sends,” Ulmer said. “Having our community help low-income students is a great symbol of the level of care we wish to show for those who may face hard times. It really makes a difference when we tell students who face situations at home that they will have a place here if they need it.”

Recently appointed Somali Ambassador to the United States Ahmed Isse Awad and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau of African Affairs Shannon Smith emphasized the improved U.S.-Somali relationship and discussed strategies to defeat the terrorist group Al-Shabaab at an event in the Intercultural Center on Tuesday.
Director of the African Studies Program Scott Taylor moderated the event, which was the first event of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy’s series on African ambassadors.
Smith spoke about the history of the U.S.-Somali relationship and future plans for the strategic partnership. The United States stopped recognizing Somalia’s government in 1991, following a civil war in the country.
Smith said the 1993 battle for Mogadishu — Somalia’s capital — in which 18 American soldiers were killed in efforts to stabilize the country, served as a turning point in U.S.-Somali relations.
“It’s hard to overestimate the importance of this moment [in U.S.-Somali relations],” Smith said. “It became seared into the memories of a generation of policymakers and legislators. … It is the moment of Somalia that they most remember.”
Since the battle, Smith said U.S.-Somali relations have moved in a positive direction in the last decade.
“It is incumbent on us to understand that it is the past and we must look forward to the future,” Smith said.
Smith and Awad also spoke about the 2012 Somali election. Following the elections, in 2013, the United States recognized Somalia as a country for the first time in 22 years. In early November, the Somali embassy reopened in Washington, D.C., and the State Department hopes to soon reopen its own embassy in Somalia.
Awad further discussed what he feels are the two narratives of Somalia. While Awad believes that the predominant global narrative is one of war and chaos, he said that the crisis-stricken image of Somalia does not truly reflect the country.
“75 percent of the narrative is the resilience of the Somali people,” Awad said. “Somali people have not only survived the devastating civil war but have actually thrived and prospered.”
Awad said the emergence of major cities in Somalia is proof of its evolution and modernization.
“After Somalia collapsed in 1991, everything was in Mogadishu. You want to go to university, you go to Mogadishu. You want to go to the hospital, you go to Mogadishu. … Today, Somalia has more than two dozen major centers where there are airports … [and] universities,” Awad said.
Praising the spirit of entrepreneurship throughout the country, Awad also said Somalia carries a reputation of economic success.
Taylor concluded the event by asking Smith how U.S. policymakers could best stop Al-Shabaab.
Smith said that a global approach to tackling Al-Shabaab would be tantamount in the group’s elimination.
“It will take the sustained commitment of the international community. … It’s not just Somalia’s problem; it’s the region’s, it’s the world’s,” Smith said.
Awad also offered specific solutions.
“You have to defeat them militarily, you have to defeat them ideologically … and they have to be defeated economically,” Awad said.
Preetham Chippada (SFS ’19) said that the discussion about Al-Shabaab was particularly relevant to forging a path to stronger U.S.-Somali relations.
“I liked the discussion about Al-Shabaab, especially about how the youth were susceptible and how the youth need to be empowered, because I think that’s a very relevant discussion to building a stronger country and building stronger relations with the United States,” Chippada said.

Georgetown University School of Medicine clinical professors of psychiatry Liza H. Gold and Robert I. Simon argued that links between mass gun violence and mental health are exaggerated in their book Gun Violence and Mental Illness, which will available for sale in December.
Gold said she was inspired to begin research for the book after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The shooter, Adam Lanza, had been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome.
“I just decided that I needed to educate myself about what was going on with this,” Gold said. “The more I learned, the more I felt that if I, as a regularly well-educated professional psychiatrist, didn’t know some of this data, then how likely was it that many other people didn’t know either? And so was born the idea for the book.”
In her research, Gold found that of the roughly 33 thousand deaths from guns per year, two thirds are firearm suicides, with most of the rest resulting from interpersonal violence. Mass shootings account for less than 1 percent of gun related deaths, peaking at 0.53 percent in 2012, the year of the shootings in Aurora, CO. and Newtown, CT.
According to Gold, when people with mental illness have access to firearms, they are much more likely to commit suicide than to harm anyone else.
“It’s hard to talk about mental illness without raising all these negative stereotypes associated with it,” Gold said. “The reality is that most people with serious mental illness are not violent. … The incidence of a person with mental illness committing gun violence against a stranger is one of the rarest forms of gun violence in the country.”
Gold argued that the policy response should be refocused from broad gun control legislation to firearm regulation based on recognized categories of risk identified through research.
“I don’t think people should be talking more about gun control policy. Gun control is a dead issue,” Gold said. “I think we need to be talking about sensible firearm regulation and raise the standards for people to whom we are willing to sell firearms to make them more accountable.”
Gold advocated temporarily separating someone at risk of harming themselves or others from his weapon. She cited California’s 2014 Gun Violence Restraining Order, which enables people to petition for law enforcement to take an individual’s firearm if they believe that the person is at risk of committing violence.
“Many people will voluntarily give up their firearms to family members or friends,” Gold said. “It doesn’t mean they have to sell them or get rid of them, but when the person is in crisis, for however long that may be, if they care about their loved one, they shouldn’t have access to firearms.”
Georgetown Against Gun Violence President Emma Iannini (SFS ’16) said that people often turn to mental health issues as the easiest problem to address after the tragedy of a mass shooting.
“There’s this false narrative in the media that people who are prone to mental health crises are more likely to engage in gun violence, either against themselves or others, and that’s really a huge fallacy that unfortunately underpins a lot of the public policy suggestions that elected officials have put forward at the congressional level,” Iannini said. “After Newtown, we saw a lot of focus on what can done on the mental health issue, because that’s the least controversial facet of the problem that impacts gun violence.”
Iannini agreed with the book’s emphasis on firearm regulation, but said there is a need to establish a mental health database that limits the quantity of guns and ammunition an individual can purchase within a given timeframe, based on his status in the database.
“The deadliest incidences of massacre shootings are where you have casualties or injuries of over half a dozen people. A lot of times that level of violence is able to be done because people have purchased multiple rounds of ammunition and have multiple weapons on them,” Iannini said. “I would say that quantity restriction has, at least in my personal opinion, some merit to it.”
Michael Khan (COL ’18), a writer for “The Right Way,” the Georgetown College Republicans’ blog, agreed with Gold’s advocacy of action other than gun control. [Disclaimer: Khan is also a columnist for The Hoya.]
“These mass shootings, as horrific as they are, really won’t be solved by any more gun control,” Khan said. “Most gun crime is committed with handguns. There’s no gun control that could solve any of those problems. Their findings seem to work against it.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article indicated that Gold and Simon were psychology professors. They are clinical professors of psychiatry. Gold has also requested corrections to quotes spoken in error for the sake of accuracy. This includes previous statements linking mental illness with suicide as well as firearm policy based on categories of risk.

I have been working with mental health individuals for the past 7 years at an agency in Nebraska.  The consumers talked about the violence issue in groups.  They are concerned about the stigma that is associated with violence and MH.  The observation that they will harm themselves not others when they have a weapon seems to be true.  Several suicides but no harm to others.  I have been reading a book about Columbine written by one of the shooters mothers and they Von Mour shooting.  Depression was a common thread among the shooters in both situations.

The university joined over 217 institutions in signing President Barack Obama’s American Campus Act on Climate pledge in support of the ongoing 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on Nov. 19.
Other universities that signed the pledge include Brown University, Dartmouth College, Duke University and Johns Hopkins University. The pledge demonstrates the university’s solidarity with the Obama administration’s stated goal to reduce climate change through negotiations at the Paris Climate Change Conference. The conference, which began Nov. 30, aims to establish an international legal agreement on environmental issues.
“As institutions of higher education, we applaud the progress already made to promote clean energy and climate action as we seek a comprehensive, ambitious agreement at the upcoming United Nations Climate Negotiations in Paris,” the pledge reads. “Today our school pledges to accelerate the transition to low-carbon energy while enhancing sustainable and resilient practices across our campus.”
The university added four points to the foundation of the pledge to specify its own actions on climate change. It promised to cut its greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2020, offer educational opportunities for students interested in the environment, research climate change issues and continue dialogue related to the environment.
“In keeping with Georgetown’s Jesuit heritage, our core mission of creating knowledge and our commitment to justice and common good, we are addressing critical sustainability challenges through our academic mission, our physical footprint and our financial operations,” the pledge reads. “We recognize the urgent need to act now to avoid irreversible costs to our global community.”
Audrey Stewart, director of Georgetown’s office of sustainability, said that the climate pledge is an affirmation of a commitment to combating climate change from both the university and its peer institutions.
“The strong show of support on this issue from college campuses demonstrates that higher education is playing an important leadership role in finding global solutions to the critical issue of climate,” Stewart wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The pledge is a continuation and reaffirmation of GU’s existing and ongoing work to address climate change in our research and teaching, our engagement activities and our operational practices.”
Director of the Georgetown Center for the Environment Edward Barrows expressed satisfaction with the university’s decision to sign the pledge. Barrows noted that, despite the approach of exam season, students should still ensure that they do their part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
“It’s wonderful that GU signed the American Campus Act on Climate Pledge,” Barrows wrote in an email to The Hoya. “GU people are very busy, but it would well worth our time if we all united in this endeavor for the future of … biodiversity and, in turn, our own society and health.”
Barrows added that while adhering to the mission of the pledge is a good starting point, members of the university community should still take further action in preventing climate change.
“All GU people should know about the pledge,” Barrows wrote. “Each can help to reduce our climate crisis, including using renewable energy, reusing and recycling [and] reducing heating and cooling.”
Barrows mentioned the danger that global warming presents to the planet, pointing to education on climate change as key in helping citizens understand the severity of this threat.
“People should change many of their habits if we are going to reduce our extreme output of greenhouse gas pollutants. Global warming is the worst crisis we are facing,” Barrows wrote. “There is so much we should all learn about our climate crisis.”
Zachary Larkin (SFS ’18) treasurer of EcoAction, which seeks to promote environmental conservation through education and advocacy, encouraged members of the Georgetown community to become more actively involved in campus environmental groups so that the goals of the pledge can be fulfilled.
“EcoAction is happy about this development and we certainly think it’s a step in the right direction,” Larkin said. “EcoAction hopes we can work with [the community] in the near future to help Georgetown achieve its climate change-related goals.”
Efforts spearheaded by Georgetown University Fossil Free to create a student-wide referendum on divestment were rejected by the Georgetown University Student Association on Nov. 22. The referendum, which aimed to enable students to vote on university divestment from the top 200 fossil fuel companies, would have been placed on the GUSA executive ballot in February.
GUFF member Chloe Lazarus (COL ’16) said the group supports the university’s participation in the pledge but believes further action should still be taken, particularly in terms of divestment.
“GU Fossil Free is pleased to see Georgetown supporting action to combat climate change though we feel it is hypocritical that the university continues to profit off of systems that perpetuate climate change, namely fossil fuel companies,” Lazarus wrote in an email to The Hoya. “If Georgetown is committed to international climate action, it must begin by divesting itself from fossil fuel companies.”
In other efforts to address environmental issues, the university’s goal to cut its greenhouse gas emissions in half from its 2006 level was met at the beginning of the 2014 fiscal year. It has also reduced its carbon footprint by 17 percent since 2005 and diverts over 90 percent of its waste from landfills each year.
In 2012, the university signed then Washington, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray’s College and University Sustainability Pledge with eight other D.C. universities to establish concrete sustainability plans.
Additionally, the university hosts the Georgetown Climate Center, which seeks to enact policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It has also established the Georgetown University Energy Prize, which will reward a community with $5 million in 2017 for sustainable innovations.

NASA’s chief scientist Ellen Stofan emphasized the reality of climate change and advocated for increased reliance on scientific data in the Philodemic Room of Healy Hall on Wednesday.
Around 60 students, faculty and community members attended the talk, entitled “Helping Countries Build Climate Resilience.”
Stofan began the event by countering the common misconception that NASA’s work is only focused on space and not on earthly problems.
“When I talk about what NASA does, I like to use the phrase ‘we look outward, inward and homeward.’ I think outward is the part you’re most familiar with; we look out into the solar system, out into the universe,” Stofan said.
Stofan said that climate change is a reality that has been confirmed by climate models.
“The global deviation from surface temperature from the late 1800s to the present day … [shows that] as we come towards the [present], especially in the last 15 years, the planet gets warmer and warmer … [and] I have a lot of people who come to me and say ‘I didn’t know you had evidence like this’,” Stofan said.
Stofan emphasized that there is no possibility that climate change is theoretical as shown by distinct scientific evidence.
“A lot of people think that climate change is something theoretical; it’s not theoretical, the climate is changing, the Earth is getting warmer and we have clear evidence of that from the temperature record,” Stofan said.
Part of NASA’s work on climate change involves modeling future temperatures on the basis of two climate models, one estimated on conservative emission levels and one on a worse-case scenario estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Climate change models are based on Representative Concentration Pathways, predictions about climate change emissions until the year 2100. An RCP of 4.5 predicts low emission growth, while an RCP of 8.5 predicts higher emission growth and is the worse-case scenario.
The RCP 4.5 scenario assumes emissions will peak around 2040 and then decline, while RCP 8.5 takes into account rising emissions through the 21st century.
“RCP 4.5 says that within the next 20 years, based on things like the discussions that are going on at [Conference of Parties 21 in Paris ] over the past week, we’re going to radically cut carbon emissions and slow the pace of climate change,” Stofan said.
Even under the more optimistic RCP 4.5, Stofan emphasized that surface temperatures will rise as high as 109 degrees Fahrenheit based on NASA”s climate models. Stofan said that if emission levels exceed the predictions of RCP 4.5, and instead reach the emissions levels of RCP 8.5, whole sections of the earth might become uninhabitable.
“You can see the earth is well above 45 degrees [Celsius] which is about 117 [Farenheit]. Huge sections of the earth in July of 2099 are going to be so hot that it can’t support things like photosynthesis … photosynthesis shuts off,” Stofan said.
NASA works with over 122 countries and two organizations and has 19 satellites operating in an effort to better understand the planet.
Of all 60 current NASA operating missions, 44 have some international component. Stofan also spoke of the possibility of NASA identifying and researching other habitable planets, or planets that have water on their surfaces.
“Right now we’re only able to determine about [planets’] size and their orbit, but in 2018 we’re going to launch a new telescope called the James Webb Space Telescope. this is going to start looking at the atmospheres of some of these potentially habitable planets,” Stofan said.
Stofan said although the reality of climate change is depressing, it must be shared so that countries can make decisions that will benefit their populations in the long run.
“So these are really worrying scenarios. On the other hand, we’re putting these models out there with this high resolution to allow countries around the world to say, ‘Do I grow the right crops? What’s going to happen to my precipitation, my temperatures, so that I can start making decisions about how I’m going to feed my population?’” Stofan said.
Kyle Rinaudo (SFS ’18) said hearing from NASA’s head scientist was inspiring.
“It’s fascinating just to hear about all the things that are going on and all the problems that are being solved by NASA that otherwise I would have never known about. … It’s actually inspiring to see these people that are doing these things that I would have never imagined,” Rinaudo said.
Victorino Floro (MSFS ’17) said he particularly enjoyed hearing about NASA’s international aid efforts and projects.
“I don’t think that a lot of the different programs that NASA does [are known] … they are doing a lot of work in relation to looking at the earth, and particularly because of climate change more people have to become more aware of the work that NASA is doing,” Floro said. “All we need is the will to use the data so that Earth can stay habitable.”

Washington, D.C., was named the snobbiest city on the East Coast and ranked seventh nationally in a survey from RoadSnacks, a regional-data information website.
The survey, published Nov. 11, compiled information using designated affluence indicators including income, home prices, education levels, theaters and Whole Foods Market stores per capita.
Georgetown sociology professor and affluence researcher Peter Cookson said that D.C.’s position as the only East Coast city on the list of 10 represents the country’s shift in wealth away from the region and transformation of elite culture.
“In previous times, being snobby was associated with being East Coast, going to the right school. You didn’t have to be fabulously wealthy but you had to be affluent,” Cookson said. “So much of the money has shifted to the West Coast, and I think there’s a different culture there. So the definition of snobby changes a little bit. It has more to do with lifestyle. You could be a billionaire in Silicon Valley and maybe not even graduate from high school.”
Cookson said that understanding D.C.’s history is essential to making sense of the city as it is now.
“During the ‘70s and ‘80s, it was actually kind of a poor city and a lot of businesses were closed up along Pennsylvania Avenue. It was small. There were no outdoor cafes like there are now,” Cookson said. “Since then, it’s become much more cosmopolitan and sort of European.”
According to Cookson, an influx of ambitious young homeowners has resulted in a culture shift, with the city now revolving around its culture of professionalism, which many deem the cornerstone of its snobby reputation.
“You have this sense of competition and excitement, located throughout, but primarily on Capitol Hill and obviously the White House,” Cookson said.
Additionally, Cookson said that although the survey measured average income, an accumulated-wealth factor is missing.
“If you did an accumulated-wealth dimension, New York would certainly win. I mean, D.C. is not even in the same category as New York,” Cookson said. “New York is still the Mecca for really, really big money.”
Sophia Anwar, who moved to D.C. in 2014 and serves as legislative correspondent for Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence (D-M), disagreed with the snobby label attributed to the District. She argued that it stems from misperceptions of the city’s fast-paced and professional atmosphere.
“I don’t think it’s snobby. I think it’s just a very, I don’t want to say exclusive, but because everyone lives kind of the same type of lifestyle here, we’re very in tune to the way that D.C. works,” Anwar said. “That can sometimes be hard to grasp if you don’t also work or live in the District.”
Anwar attributed the snobby reputation of the city to the focus on networking and scheduling, emphasizing that this might be intimidating to young professionals.
“These people have really busy schedules. So I think that can be sometimes daunting,” Anwar said. “People think that other people are blowing them off or being snobby, but in fact they’re just really busy.”
Priya Bhaidaswala (MSB ’17) objected to the use of the label and the potentially negative associations that accompany it.
“I’d say snobby usually indicates a sense of being better than others,” Bhaidaswala said. “And then that betterness is usually portrayed through elitist behavior, like not being inclusive, interactions that show a divide between people.”
Bhaidaswala also said she was surprised at the survey’s results and disagreed with its conclusion.
“I don’t think that D.C. is snobby. There are a lot of nonprofits and charities and such,” Bhaidaswala said. “People who are working for these companies, even though paid well, usually want some kind of social impact or work for the greater good.”
Cookson also pointed to the possible benefits of the label, including perceived prestige and, consequently, higher location values.
“I think, not to be facetious, that it helps real estate a great deal. I think people buy real estate based on location,” Cookson said. “If they think it’s an affluent, snobby neighborhood, then the real estate values will increase.”
Cookson added that the humorous nature of the report could minimize the importance of class differences in these cities.
“It kind of is a little misleading, the snobby label, because it sort of makes it all fun,” Cookson said. “But class differences matter in people’s lives.”
