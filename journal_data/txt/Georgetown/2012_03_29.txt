The McDonough School of Business fell four spots, from 10th to 14th, in Bloomberg Businessweek’s2012 rankings of undergraduate business schools.
The drop came one year after the university jumped from 23rd in 2010 to 10th place last year.
“Once a school breaks into the very top of a ranking, the slightest variation in data can be the difference between several places,” MSB Dean David Thomas wrote in an email.
Thomas attributed last year’s increase to curricular enhancements, like the first-year seminar, and the opening of the Hariri Building in fall 2009.
Addressing this year’s drop, MSB Senior Associate Dean and Director of the Undergraduate ProgramNorean Sharpe emphasized that many measures of the school’s success are not considered when determining rankings, such as this year’s 21 percent increase in regular-decision applicants and 14 percent acceptance rate for early action applicants.
Businessweek’s 2012 rankings also listed the MSB as 49th in its student satisfaction rankings, drawing mixed student reactions.
Dimitri Roumeliotis (MSB ’15) said he has been very satisfied with his experience in the MSB so far this year.
“I think [the school has] a lot of support. The [MSB Technology] Center is really good at helping us get what we need for class, and in general they have a lot of peer advisors and deans to talk to,” he said.
However, according to Ian Lundy (MSB ’15), resources for freshmen can be limited at times.
“I would like a little more personalized attention from the counseling office,” he said. “I think I’m going to get that when I declare my major, but for freshmen there aren’t many resources to get advice.”
Adrian Mansylla (MSB ’13) also expressed concerns about student-administration interactions.
“Although I’m satisfied with my experience at the business school, working with the administration can be tough and frustrating,” he said.
While the MSB’s position fell overall, rankings for other categories that gauge student success and teaching quality remained high. The school is currently tied in second place for students’ earning the highest median starting salaries and sixth for sending students to top MBA programs. Its professors earned an A plus in teaching quality.
“I personally am very satisfied with the professors I’ve had, with the curriculum and with class sizes,” Lundy said.
Lundy expressed enthusiasm about study abroad opportunities that will allow him to explore possible majors early in his academic career.
“I’m going to Spain this summer to study international marketing and entrepreneurship,” he said. “That’s not an opportunity most freshmen would have.”
Thomas and Sharpe both argued that rankings capture only a limited part of the school’s characteristics.
“McDonough is distinguished by its tradition in leadership and service, and I envision the school being known around the world for producing graduates who are principled leaders in service to business and society,” Thomas wrote. “If we build a premier program, the rankings will follow.”

As the university works to reconcile aspects of a traditional liberal arts education with growing research programs, striking a balance can be a particular challenge for its graduate programs.
Gerald Mara, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, hopes to settle the score by boosting the university’s reputation for academic research at a time when graduate application numbers continue to rise.
“I want to pay particular importance to the Ph.D. programs, because graduates of these programs often associate with us as a research university,” Mara said.
Applications to Georgetown’s graduate programs are up about 4.5 percent this year compared to 2011, according to Mara, which may be due in part to a nationwide trend of those unable to find jobs deciding to return to school.
“In times of economic downturn, graduate programs tend to see their application rates rise due to the difficult job market,” Mara said.
Though applications increased in number, debt incurred by graduate students and the potential long-term financial consequences is still a concern to many. According to Mara, the university’s current capital campaign may help address the issue.
“I am excited that the capital campaign will contribute to graduate student financial aid. This is the first time it has been a line item,” he said.
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences functions as an umbrella institution for the graduate degrees offered by departments within the Georgetown College, the School of Nursing and Health Studies, the School of Foreign Service and the McDonough School of Business.
According to Mara, applications to all programs have either remained steady or seen recent increases this year. The public policy, foreign service and security studies graduate programs, some of the university’s most specialized offerings, continue to receive the most applicants.
The NHS recently added several online nursing programs and has become increasingly popular over the last five years. While the Nursing @ Georgetown program expected to enroll 25 students in fall 2011, 110 students joined that semester.
“As our [students] graduate and go on to do really great things, people get interested. I expect that [our popularity] will continue to grow into the future,” Chair of the Department of Health Services and Administration Patricia Coonan said.
Administrators in each school said curriculum changes and expansions are planned for several graduate programs.
The two NHS offerings, nursing and health systems administration, have developed a new focus on quantitative analysis in an attempt to better prepare students for modern health care systems.
A recent overhaul of the masters in business administration program has also increased its focus on quantitative and analytical skills and its emphasis on a global business perspective, according to administrators.
“The new curriculum is a better reflection of the Georgetown McDonough identity,” Senior Associate Dean for the full-time MBA program Elaine Romanelli said.
Romanelli added that the university’s graduate and undergraduate programs ultimately complement one another.
“As one gets stronger, the other gets stronger as well,” she said.
