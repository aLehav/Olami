Around 500 protestors gathered outside of the White House late Monday night, demonstrating against a grand jury decision to not indict Ferguson, Mo. police officer Darren Wilson. Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in August.

Protests broke out in Ferguson and across the nation Monday night. In Washington, D.C., protesters convened on U Street and marched to the White House. Among the protesters were students from Georgetown, Howard University and other D.C. colleges.
Protesters chanted slogans such as “Hands up, don’t shoot,” “Black lives matter” and “Black power.”
“We have to have a sense of accountability. If you shoot a kid with his hands up for allegedly stealing Cigarillos, you deserve to be in trouble for it,” Tarik Endale (NHS ’16), who attended the demonstrations at the White House, said. “That’s kind of how the justice system works, but apparently it doesn’t apply to the people who are supposed to be enforcing it.”
At midnight, the protesters left the White House and marched toward Chinatown. Demonstrations are planned for every day this week, including a protest at Mount Vernon Square on Tuesday at 7 p.m. and a protest at Union Station early Wednesday.

Hey Tarik, why don’t you drop out of Georgetown and go to the police academy and see what a difficult job it is to be a cop and put your life in the line everyday. Georgetown can fill your spot with an intelligent and insightful person.

Why does Tarik Endale believe that Michael Brown was killed for “stealing cigarillos”?

Verdict?

In other words, why is the Hoya using the word “Verdict” in the headline.   It means that Officer Wilson was indicted, tried in a criminal court, and found not guilty by a jury.  That is mis-educating the public on this sensitive and sometimes technical story.

The Hoya’s reporting suggests that Michael Brown’s hands were “up” when he was shot and that he was shot “for stealing cigarillos” (rather than for allegedly attacking an officer).  Please provide your source on that important point.  The Hoya did not report that MB allegedly “charged” the officer like a “bull”, allegedly attacked him in his car, etc.  Why?

AP story 11/27/14: ‘Hands Up. Don’t Shoot’ based on lie?

The Hoya isn’t reporting anything about the incident. They are reporting on the Georgetown and Washington DC community reactions, which include a quote from a student who said the things you claim the Hoya is reporting.

hoyalum says

That’s why I used the word “suggests”.   Reporting witness statements that are biased only to one side is problematic.

There is nothing written in the US constituion guaranteeing a “civil right” for young black males to steal, assault and disobey law enforcement. The only civil rights that were violated were those of Officer Wilson. This man’s life is now in shambles because he did his job. He can no longer work as a public servant, nor can he even show his face in public. Officer Wilson is portrayed as the bad guy, while the family of Michael Brown is shown on national TV encouraging destruction of the community with no public reprimand. 
The most disturbing and sad aspect of the whole situation is the ignorance of not just the black activists, but also the white liberals. Justice was served long before the grand jury made a decision. Michael Brown made the decision, not the grand jury. His parents should be outraged because their son was not the “gentle giant” they thought he was. Unfortunately, situations like this will surely happen again. It was a tragedy that a young man lost his life, but the real tragedy is the lack of common sense, morality and indivual accountability in the black community. The law was followed and a decision was made. Deal with it, move one and rise up against the thugs who are destroying our way of life, not those who are fighting to protect it. 
As for the protestors across the USA, where is the line drawn between making a point and causing criminal acts? Blocking highways and intersections to protest civil right violations causes gridlock, inconvenience and anger. Protesters are violating the rights of those who wish to travel freely. How is this acceptable? How does inconveniencing the general public help your cause? The level of ignorance surrounding this entire matter from day one is sickening and unbelievable. Protests such as those that we’ve seen are pointless and will only serve to work against those trying to affect change. 
Protesting will not solve the problem. We need parents to teach respect, morals and values to our children. We must teach our children to do the right thing, not to find fault with what is wrong. This is only a matter of race because black activists make it so. What if it had been a black officer and a white victim? What if it were an Asian or a Hispanic? Does it really matter? A crime was committed and a police officer who was sworn to protect and serve the community did his job. There is a system in place to ensure justice. The system worked. And now, for those who choose to use this as reason to cause violence and destruction, you too will find out how the justice system works when you are arrested and removed from society.

Ditto the “Hear hear”.  
Very insightful.  Very intelligent.  Very mature.  All things lacking in the media reporting of this non-incident and in the Hoya’s community response to it.

Michael Brown robbed a local Ferguson convenience store shortly before his death. Then Brown smashed police officer Darren Wilson in the face and wrestled the officer for his gun before he was shot dead. At least seven black Ferguson witnesses corroborated Officer Darren Wilson’s story. Officer Darren Wilson was not indicted by the St. Louis County grand jury after an extensive investigation. But facts be damned.
[…] schools like New York University, the University of Pennsylvania, Georgetown University and the University of California, Berkeley, students joined ongoing city […]

Construction on the sand volleyball court in the Southwest Quad began last week, and is slated for completion in early December.
The project was announced earlier this month as part of an initiative led by the Campus Life Working Group to create new recreation opportunities in underutilized spaces. The $86,000 court was funded entirely through donations from the Student Activities Commission, the Advisory Board for Club Sports and the Pisano family. It has also received support from the Georgetown University Student Association.
GUSA Secretary of Space Connor Maytnier (COL ’17) said the new court will significantly improve the use of open space on the SWQ.
“In the past, the open space has primarily been used as a diagonal cross walk. The grass was always dead, it looked awful and the space was never used for any specific purposes,” Maytnier said. “The new court will finally make the Southwest Quad a true social gathering space for students.”
Maytnier said the court will be open to all students, potentially by appointment with the SWQ Residence Hall Office.
“Anyone will be able to use the space. We are still working out the details as to whether or not the court will actually be reservable for periods of time,” Maytnier said. “We will have volleyballs on hand at the Southwest Quad RHO that students can check out using their GOCard.”
According to Advisory Board for Club Sports Chair Lucy Gibson (COL ’15), ABCS donated $12,000 to the project from their reserve account.
“The board felt it would better the campus and serve the community in a way that aligned with the spirit of club sports at Georgetown,” Gibson said. “It will transform an underutilized area on campus to a more dynamic space for students to hang out and play volleyball outside.”
Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said the construction will have minimal impact on students living in the SWQ, with no noisy work to begin before 9 a.m.
“Construction impacts on students are expected to be minimal,” Morey wrote in an email. “Noise levels are expected to be minimal.”
In addition to the volleyball court, a grilling area was recently added to the SWQ to enhance the outdoor community and social space.
“The overall vision when we started this initiative in October 2013 was to transform the quad into a premier gathering space,” Maytnier said. “In the coming months, I hope to secure more seating options for the quad so that we can truly complete our initial goal.”
Southwest Quad resident Jenny Xiao (MSB ’17) said that she does not expect the court to be used often.
“It seems like a pretty random decision. I don’t think that volleyball is popular among students here, so I doubt it’ll be used much,” Xiao said. “Also, it can’t be used during the winter, so it’s a bit of a waste of space.”

As students prepare to leave for Thanksgiving, filled with thoughts of warm homes and good food, retail stores have something else on their mind: holiday sales.
Retailers cut prices exorbitantly to entice consumers and increase their profits around the holidays, especially for the post-Thanksgiving Black Friday sales.
However, a newly-released survey by the Georgetown Institute for Consumer Research reveals that stores are unlikely to attract new customers from Black Friday sales, and retailers might actually lose profits by selling discounted merchandise to consumers who would shop their respective stores anyway.
Kurt Carlson, director of GICR, an initiative of the McDonough School of Business sponsored by consulting firm KPMG, conducted the survey with research director Ishani Banerji and research associates Annie Wilson (COL ’13) and Iris Wang. The online survey reached 1,000 U.S. citizens, with a median age of 32 years old and an average income of approximately $42,000.
Carlson expressed surprise at the results, given the intention of retailers who advertise sales.
“When we consider that one of the biggest reasons to run a sale is to attract new customers who will hopefully spend at full price in the future, it does suggest that much of the energy and margin retails are giving up during these holiday sales is for naught,” he said.
Banerji speculated this sort of consumer behavior is a reflection of outside factors of the holiday season. She said the season could be stressful for shoppers, so consumers will rely on the stores where they feel most comfortable.
“You know how the clothes fit, where they keep the tools or whatever else it is that you’re buying. Because of this familiarity, you don’t want to go to other stores,” she said.
The survey also predicted that spending on electronics — which composed 95 percent of last year’s sales — will make up only 67 percent of shopping for the 2014 season, attributing these relatively low numbers to a lack of new and popular electronics debuting in the coming months.
Banerji said these results imply that much of the success of holiday sales rely on building hype for certain products, adding that retailers should carefully time the release of new products to take advantage of the increased consumer activity between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
“If you want consumers to be spending a lot of money on your category, at this time of the year, then there has to be something that they get really excited about that’s launching right around Thanksgiving,” she said.
Although the holiday shopping season is always busy, 65 percent of the survey’s respondents do not support stores opening Thanksgiving evening to begin Black Friday sales.
Georgetown students attributed the frenzy that surrounds Black Friday as one of the major reasons dissuading them from being eager participants in the sales.
“It’s ironic how people will claw each other over boots on sale barely 24 hours after the most thankful day of the year,” Elizabeth Borowiec (COL ’17) said.
Bianca DiSanto (MSB ’17) said shopping is not on her list of plans for the upcoming break.
“I don’t plan on participating in Black Friday shopping,” she said. “I’m too busy recovering from gorging myself on Thanksgiving.”
Despite their inability to attract a substantial amount of new customers, Banerji noted the popularity of Thanksgiving sales among retailers speaks to the broader consumer activity of the holiday shopping season. Consumers, she said, shop for gifts more than anything else.
“People do most of their shopping for other people,” she said. “This is really the time you’re starting your holiday gift-giving.”

A broken network circuit caused sluggish, sporadic Internet connections and Google Apps outages on campus accounts Wednesday through Friday.
University Information Services is still investigating the cause of the network circuit malfunction, but reportedly fixed the problem by switching to another circuit.
“A circuit is the network path that your data takes when it leaves the Hilltop,” Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis said. “And the really good news is that we have multiple paths. So once we isolated the incident and started testing our network, we had the ability to switch over to a different path. Once we did that, we noticed that our packets and our data flow started picking up to normal speed.”
Although the university has had occasional Google outages in the past, most issues have been resolved within an hour at the most, according to Davis.
Davis said that a handful of student calls to the UIS Help Desk on Wednesday prompted an investigation of the claims. Davis contacted Google staff, who helped her troubleshoot the problem.
“One of the things that we also noticed was from a network perspective, the only app that seemed to be having problems was Google Apps,” Davis said. “If that was the case, you would eliminate it being a network issue because if it was a network issue, there would have been multiple apps … would experience a latency as well”
Once the university concluded it was not a router or a software issue at Google, it began testing possible complications in Georgetown’s network. After attention was turned to the network, UIS quickly found the circuit problem.
Davis said that the UIS team is still investigating why the malfunction occurred, and that they expect to have answers before offices close on Wednesday.
“What’s really interesting about that — and this is the analysis that’s still going on — we still don’t understand the root cause of why that particular circuit was having problems connecting with the Google servers,” Davis said.
Davis acknowledged that many students and faculty members were inconvenienced by the sluggish Internet, but said that no significant problems arose from the incident.
“It’s unfortunate,” Davis said. “We want to provide the best service possible. And we don’t like it when there’s a slowness in our network. We want to make sure everybody’s able to access their systems and their data and do what they need to do.”
Ryan Wolfe (COL ’18) said that the Google outage came during a deadline for a paper he had saved to Google Docs, nearly causing him to miss his deadline.
“The day I needed to print [my assignment], it was downloading at a quarter of the speed of dial-up. It caused me a lot of undue stress,” Wolfe said.
Connor O’Dwyer (COL ’16) said that he experienced trouble last week while trying to conduct research for a paper.
“I had to do research online through the library’s website,” O’Dwyer said. “But it took me over half an hour to figure out the Internet connection. It was so slow, the library’s website wouldn’t even load. … I think the university could be doing better work to secure better wi-fi for the whole campus.”

The University of California, Los Angeles’ undergraduate student government voted Tuesday night to pass a resolution calling the university to divest from American companies profiting from human rights violations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to the Daily Bruin, prompting mixed reactions from Georgetown student groups.
Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), a member of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, voiced his disappointment with the results of UCLA’s divestment resolution.
“I was very saddened and frustrated to hear the news of what happened at UCLA. I think it’s far outside the scope of any student government jurisdiction to work on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Goldstein said.
Mathieu Wiener (MSB ’16) decided to form a chapter of the national organization Students Supporting Israel at Georgetown on Nov. 22, partly in response to the UCLA resolution, expressing his disappointment as well.
“Speaking on behalf of SSI, as an organization that stands for pluralism and justice and public discourse, we are appalled and disgusted by the resolution that passed. The resolution only adds fuel to the fire because it demonizes and de-legitimizes the world’s sole Jewish state and alienates Israeli moderates who support peace with the Palestinians,” Wiener said.
Matt Martin (COL ’16), a member of Students for Justice in Palestine, however, expressed his support for UCLA’s decision and for the student government’s initiative.
“What’s great about UCLA’s student government voting to pressure the university to divest, is that it’s an example of students internalizing the responsibility we all have to hold groups contributing to human rights violations accountable,” Martin wrote in an email.
UCLA has now joined the six other universities to pass similar divestment resolutions, including University of California campuses at Santa Cruz, Irvine, San Diego, Riverside and Berkeley.
“It is the University of California, Los Angeles’ duty to uphold the True Bruin values of integrity, excellence, accountability and ethicality, respect for the rights and dignity of others, and promote public service that makes a positive impact in our global community, which includes the promotion of human rights, equality, and dignity for all people without distinction,” the resolution reads.
The resolution condemned companies said to violate human rights in Palestine, such as Hewlett-Packard Company for supplying Israeli military checkpoints with biometric identification which “restricted the freedom of movement of Palestinians,” General Electric for building engines for helicopters which are “systematically used in attacks on Palestinian civilians,” Caterpillar for “continually providing engineering tools and bulldozers routinely used in the demolition of Palestinian homes, as well as Cement Roadstone Holdings and Cemex for providing building materials toward means used to violate human rights.
Martin praised the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Campaign for calling for an end to these supposed human rights violations.
“The Boycott, Divestment, Sanction Campaign, is a direct call from the Palestinian Civil Society to pressure Israel to comply with international law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” Martin wrote in an email.
Goldstein noted that although other countries have seen violence, Israel seems to be unfairly targeted in the media.
“And understandably, that makes Jewish and Israeli students feel they’re targeted, when their country is the only one in the world that’s attacked by groups, like the media,” he said.
He criticized the UCLA student government’s decision as divisive and unproductive.
“I think there are many legitimate views on how to best solve the [Israeli-Palestinian] conflict, but boycotting companies just because they’re Israeli is not one of them. It just serves to divide and destruct,” Goldstein said.
Chloe Lazarus (COL ’16), a member of GU Fossil Free, a group that urges Georgetown to divest from fossil fuel companies, said that GU Fossil Free supports divestment from companies who violate human rights.
“As a fellow social justice campaign seeking to combat the injustices associated with fossil fuel companies, GU Fossil Free supports the tactic of divesting from companies that profit at the expense of human welfare. It is clear that human rights violations are taking place and we support divestment as a means of placing pressures on amoral corporate actors as well as a way to draw public attention to overlooked instances of injustice,” Lazarus wrote in an email.
Also a member of GU Fossil Free, Goldstein said that the goals of the two groups, although both pushing for divestment, are fundamentally different in nature.
“Fossil flow divestment is a zero-sum situation, but the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is far from zero-sum,” Goldstein said.
In 2010, the Georgetown Solidarity Committee and Students for Justice in Palestine formed Georgetown, Divest!, a coalition of students calling for the university to divest from companies that are said to profit from human rights violations in Israel and Palestine.
LaMarr Billups, the Assistant Vice President for Business Policy and Planning at the time, rejected Georgetown, Divest!’s call for reform.
“At that meeting you asked if Georgetown University would divest from managed funds that own stocks in certain companies that do business with Israel. The answer to that question is no,” Billups wrote in April 2010.
Georgetown, Divest! has since been dissolved.
Georgetown University gained notoriety this fall for becoming the most-represented university in the American Studies Association’s boycott of Israeli institutions, with 13 Georgetown professors signing the boycott petition.
Part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, a global campaign aiming to end Israeli occupation and colonization of Palestinian land, establish equal rights for Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel and permit the return of Palestinian refugees, the boycott petition called for signatories to not publish in Israeli academic journals, teach at Israeli institutions, attend any conferences at Israeli universities or collaborate on projects with Israeli universities.
President John J. DeGioia denounced an earlier American Studies Association boycott in a statement issued in December 2013.
“The recent resolution of the American Studies Association endorsing a boycott of Israeli universities undermines the academic freedom that is essential to the mission of the Academy,” DeGioia said in a statement. “As an academic institution, it is Georgetown’s responsibility to deepen engagement and foster dialogue between scholars and societies to enhance the entire global academic community.”
More recently, pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered outside the Sabra Hummus House pop-up shop on Wisconsin Avenue to protest the company owners’ support of the Golani brigade of the Israeli army last month.
The U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation organized the demonstration to protest Sabra’s relationship with the Strauss Group, an Israeli food company that has served the Golani Brigade of the Israeli army, which co-owns the hummus company.

The Georgetown University Initiative on Innovation, Development and Evaluation, known as gui2de, will offer a one-credit economics incubator course that will allow students to research and design innovative solutions in developmental economics starting in the spring semester.
Students in the course will meet once a week to design projects that focus on governance, health, education and technology in developing countries. These projects will later be tested and evaluated in the field.
“The incubator course is an opportunity for students to learn about all of these different stages from initiative to evaluation,” gui2de Co-Director James Habyarimana said. “It’s also hopefully going to be about innovation. We want students to be thinking about what the problems are and mobilizing all the energy and creativity to tackle these problems.”
For the past two years, students have conducted empirical field-based research and created innovative programs and policies in developing countries through the gui2de program. Participants have travelled to developing regions in countries such as Kenya, Brazil and Rwanda. Habyarimana said that students will be able to travel to the regions of research in the summer through the new economics class.
“The goal is that we’ll have this course in the spring and in the summer, we’ll take a few students to the field and test some of the ideas that they generate,” Habyarimana said.
The course is open to upperclassmen and graduate students. According to gui2de Co-Director Billy Jack, the program welcomes students from different academic backgrounds.
“We don’t want to restrict entry based on what students have done here. We want a mix of people,” Jack said. “The idea is that innovation happens when different ideas come together. Who knows? That’s one of the big questions of economics actually — where this growth comes from.”
In previous years, projects developed by gui2de have included designing mobile applications that provide market price information for farmers in India, developing a mobile money platform to facilitate saving for education and creating a campaign for road safety intervention in Kenya.
The incubator course has received around 30 applications from pre-registration. The co-directors estimate that they will accept 10 or 12 students. Future opportunities for applications during the add/drop period are being considered.
Jack said that he would like to increase opportunities for the program in the future, but noted that any expansion would require additional grants.
“On the longer term, we’d be happy to have more [students]. In the longer term, we might find a way to combine it with the summer activity for it to be a full three-credit course,” Jack said. “Of course, it costs money to bring students to the middle of nowhere, keep them alive then bring them back.”
Last spring, Jack and Habyarimana conducted a trial run of the incubator course but failed to receive funding.
“It wasn’t a full course. I just reached out to about 10 PhD students, asked if they wanted to come over for pizza once a week,” Jack said. “We weren’t able to put together the funding for that group. They all applied to funding sources, and unfortunately did not get them.”
Whitney Odden (GRD ’14) became a program coordinator at gui2de after serving as a graduate assistant for the program. She noted that the program provided her with plenty of opportunities.
“Getting to interact with your professor in such a close-knit way is really important,” Odden said. “Being able to develop those kinds of relationships in this kind of institution, with this caliber of professors, and spending time hands-on working on problems with them is a really neat experience.”
Odden said that she learned various practical skills through the program.
“Part of the reason why I went back to school is that I didn’t really have any practical skills from a liberal arts education,” Odden said. “I didn’t know how to program anything. To get exposure to stuff like that is incredibly important. It doesn’t require you to commit to a full year or to focus on one thing. You’ll get a taste of a bit of everything, see what you like and know what you want to pursue from there.”

After 98 student groups requested $350,000 at last weekend’s Student Activities Commission summit, SAC allocated a total of $146,000 to the groups.
SAC allocated all of its available funds for this semester’s summit after withholding $5,000 for its ad hoc fund and $30,000 for its travel fund, according to SAC Chair Patrick Musgrave (COL ’16).
Musgrave estimated that students at SAC’s previous summit in April requested $300,000, and said that there was a marked increase in requests at this semester’s summit.
SAC has around $329,000 to budget per year at two separate summits, and its funds come from the Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriations Committee, The Office of Student Affairs and, minimally, from a university partnership with Coca-Cola, providing $240,000, $81,500 and $7,500, respectively.
“We’ve never had $350,000 worth of requests. … The fundamental flaw of SAC is that the more you ask for the more you get,” Musgrave said. “We’re not subjective, really, we follow very objective funding procedures.”
The summit lasted two days, and student groups presented their funding needs and budget submissions for the semester to the commission. According to Musgrave, students occasionally feel slighted by the commission because they do not know about SAC’s criteria for budget allocation.
“I think that [SAC’s] subjectivity is misconstrued a lot,” Musgrave said. “We are not a capricious body that just decides to fund some things and not fund other things. If your event meets a certain set of requirements, then you’re going to get funding.”
Animalia Vice President and Treasurer Casey Nolan (COL ’17) requested $681.90 from SAC and received $322.38.
“Overall, I am very pleased with the money we received,” Nolan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I understand that SAC only has so much money to allocate and that it is the prerogative of student groups to fund raise for a portion of their costs.”
According to Nolan, SAC has provided her club with necessary support and advice.
“SAC has provided Animalia with a lot of support in navigating the budget process, as well as with little things such as flyer printing,” Nolan wrote. “I have always found SAC members to be willing to help and answer questions, and they have helped Animalia’s first official semester as a student group run smoothly.”
Director of the Center for Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr said that SAC provides a necessary service to student groups on campus.
“SAC is an important part of student life at Georgetown because it lives at the center of many questions about student programming and student organizations,” Cohen-Derr wrote in an email to The Hoya. “SAC leaders take a bird’s eye view of student organizations and campus programming. They are uniquely positioned to hear proposals for programs from over 100 organizations, and are in the position to evaluate program proposals and compare these proposals to actual programming efforts.”
