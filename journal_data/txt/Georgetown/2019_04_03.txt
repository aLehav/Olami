Reports emerged Thursday that Pope Francis is set to appoint Archbishop of Atlanta Wilton Gregory to replace Cardinal Donald Wuerl as the archbishop of Washington, D.C., after the latter resigned following reports that he had mishandled sexual assault cases.
The Catholic News Agency first reported on Gregory’s appointment; however, the report’s reliance on anonymous sources has led many Catholic institutions and D.C. news outlets to question its validity, according to The Washington Post. As of Saturday, no other Catholic media or mainstream outlet had confirmed the report other than the far-right, web-based Catholic news outlet, Church Militant.
Gregory’s appointment would be a historic milestone for the Catholic Church in the United States, according to The Washington Post. If appointed, Gregory would be the first black Catholic archbishop of D.C.
Gregory’s appointment follows the ongoing clergy sexual abuse scandal within the church, which has implicated two former archbishops of D.C.
Former Archbishop of Washington Cardinal Theodore McCarrick was found guilty of abuse of minors and solicitation of sex from adults during confession. McCarrick became one of the highest-ranking Americans to be formally dismissed from the clerical state when he was officially defrocked by the Catholic Church on Feb. 16. 
Shortly after McCarrick was removed from public ministry, Wuerl was implicated in a Pennsylvania grand jury report last August for covering up abuse. Francis accepted Wuerl’s resignation as archbishop of Washington in October. 
McCarrick and Wuerl had both been awarded honorary degrees from Georgetown; however, McCarrick’s was revoked by the university days after he was laicized, the first time the university has ever revoked an honorary degree.
Gregory served a term as president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops from 2001 to 2004, where he led the U.S. Catholic hierarchy through the fallout of the Boston Globe’s 2002 investigation into church efforts to cover up clerical abuse.
During his term, Gregory oversaw the formation and implementation of the Dallas Charter, or the Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People, which is a comprehensive set of procedures established by the USCCB in 2002 to address allegations of sexual abuse of minors by the Catholic clergy. 
Following his tenure as president of USCCB, Gregory now works with Cardinal Timothy Dolan and Archbishop Joseph Kurtz to examine and develop proposed reforms for increasing episcopal accountability regarding the sexual abuse of minors by clergy. 
Who is set to occupy the vacant archbishop position has been the subject of speculation since November 2018, after Wuerl’s resignation. Despite public outcry following revelations of Wuerl’s involvement in covering up clerical abuse, he still sits on the Congregation for Bishops at the Vatican, which recommends candidates for bishop positions to be selected by Francis, according to the National Catholic Reporter.
The Archdiocese of Washington declined The Hoya’s request for comment, on the grounds that it was awaiting an announcement from the Vatican. 
Ed Condon, who co-wrote the original CNA report with CNA Editor-in-Chief J.D. Flynn, said he has complete faith in the contents of the article.
“We would not ever publish anything in which we did not have total confidence, especially a report in which we did not have total confidence, especially a report that we knew was likely to garner considerable attention,” Condon wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Since the release of the report, some have doubted the credibility of CNA’s reports on Gregory’s appointment. Critics of CNA’s reporting have suggested that Gregory had not been offered the job, and an individual allied with the pope was instead floating a red herring to gauge sentiment in the District, an epicenter of the sexual abuse crisis, according to The Washington Post.
Others have proposed that CNA, a right-leaning publication, released the report after it was leaked by critics of Francis to hurt Gregory’s chances of selection, as the Atlanta archbishop is considered too liberal by some orthodox critics, according to The Washington Post.
These theories exist because of the ignorance of the general public about Catholic Church affairs, according to Condon. 
“Part of the reason you often see feverish and politicized speculation or ‘conspiracy theorizing’ about Church affairs is that many simply do not understand the processes by which the Church is governed,” Condon wrote.
The red herring theory is completely unfounded based on Condon’s previous experience and background in Catholic reporting, he wrote.
“When you have a well-formed perspective of how, for example, the Congregation for Bishops works in Rome, the process is far less mysterious,” Condon wrote. “When you have spent a few years working with curial officials at close quarters, wild speculation about ‘trial balloons’ and so on seems a little funny.”

Note that the far-right fringe Church Militant is NOT a Catholic news outlet. The Archdiocese of Detroit has declared they are not Catholic and may not use Catholic in their title.

Georgetown students had the chance to “Yell at GUSA About Stuff” on Friday afternoon in an event created by newly sworn-in Georgetown University Student Association President Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Vice President Aleida Olvera (COL ’20).
Olvera and Francis created the event for students to express concerns about the role of GUSA on campus. The pair promoted “Yell at GUSA About Stuff” on Facebook, and the event entailed the executives tabling between 2:30 p.m. and 4 p.m. in Red Square to hear from the student body. During that time, about eight students came and spoke to the pair, according to Olvera. 
Olvera said that despite a small turnout, the executives were excited to hear from the students who did voice concerns at the event.
“We were happy that some students were comfortable enough to come up to ask questions! We wish more students came, but that may have been an issue on our end about marketing/communication,” Olvera wrote in an email to The Hoya. “To the students who came, we have decided to take more action towards the issues that were brought up.”
Former GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) held a similarly named “Scream at GUSA About Stuff” event in 2015, which Francis said served as precedent for this one.
The revived tactic comes at a time when many students are skeptical of GUSA’s efficiency. Two percent of respondents reported strong trust in GUSA, 23.9 percent had medium trust in GUSA and 38.9 percent had weak trust in GUSA. Thirty-five percent were indifferent or unsure, according to a Feb. 6 survey conducted by The Hoya, prior to the executive election.
Francis and Olvera narrowly defeated Nicki Gray (NHS ’20) in the final round of the election by a margin of 40 votes, in a year when voter turnout was the lowest since 2007. Their campaign emphasized T.R.A.P.: transparency, reform, accessibility and progress.
This year also marked the creation of the Abolish GUSA movement, an initiative led by an anonymous group of students seeking to replace GUSA with a more efficient and inclusive system of student government.
Abolish GUSA members did not send any representatives to the event and do not believe it is a productive solution to GUSA’s shortcomings.
“Abolish GUSA did not even know this event existed,” the group wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Though the idea is humorous, we do not believe that the very structural and institutional problems in GUSA can be solved by yelling.”
Francis said he and Aleida are aware of students’ disappointment with student government on campus and are exploring other means for students to voice concerns in a less public setting.
“We understand there’s a lot of pent up frustration at GUSA,” Francis said. “Of course, we’re still working on more private ways and more anonymous ways that folks can air their criticism.”
Members of GUSA are committed to delivering results the student body, but this work is hard to relay to the campus community, according to Olvera.
“There’s a lot of work that has been done,” Olvera wrote. “We’re trying to figure out different strategies that we can communicate that to the student body and also figure out different ways that the student body will feel comfortable enough with us to communicate.”
The pair also recognized the existing gap in communication between students and GUSA representatives in the past, which they hope to remedy with this event and future events such as a formal town hall for the community to focus on student engagement and participation.
Students had mixed reactions to the event and its concept. Oscar Matos (COL ’22) appreciated the pair’s gesture and valued their attempt at elevating student voices.
“I think that as recognizable figures around campus, it’s a great move on their part to be the medium for students to voice their concerns,” Matos wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Others were less optimistic about the student body’s willingness to engage with GUSA. Emma Vahey (COL ’20) was skeptical that outreach events could find success when much of the student body has shown indifference toward the executive in the past. (Full disclosure: Vahey is a former member of The Hoya’s editorial board.)
“Having not attended that event and honestly not even having heard of it beforehand, it doesn’t sound like a great way to connect with students, because as I said most people just can’t even be bothered,” Vahey wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I don’t know if it’ll be possible for them to ‘rebuild trust’ because so few people are invested enough, you know?”
This article was updated April 3 to include a full disclosure for Vahey.

Billionaire activist Tom Steyer called for a collective effort of U.S. citizens to back the impeachment of President Donald Trump on March 26.
Steyer launched Need to Impeach, a grassroots campaign advocating for the impeachment of Trump, in October 2017. He stepped down as CEO of Farallon Capital in 2012 to dedicate his time to philanthropy and political activism.
The Need to Impeach petition has been signed by more than 7.7 million Americans and counting, according to the campaign website. Steyer personally cites obstruction of justice, corruption and neglect of duties as commander in chief and protector of the American people as his own justifications for impeaching Trump. Both of the former presidents who were impeached, Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, were later cleared of charges by the U.S. Senate.
The campaign for impeachment requires support and backing from a large number of U.S. citizens, according to Steyer.
“The only way that this can happen is if the American people want it to happen,” Steyer said. “And the only way that the American people can have the information to make up their minds is if we have a series of public hearings so they can see who these guys are, see what they’ve done, see what they sound like.”
 
Steyer said that his campaign aims to restore power directly to the American public rather than reserve political influence for elected officials.
“Need to Impeach is an attempt to organize the voice of America,” Steyer said. “It’s an attempt to bring the American people into the conversation and not let it be dominated by people who are in Congress, inside Washington, the elites, but to have the decisions much more broadly made and much more broadly shaped.”
The event, titled “To Impeach or Not to Impeach,” was hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room and moderated by GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee. Approximately 30 people attended the event.
As a fulfillment of a campaign promise, Trump announced in June 2017 that the United States would pull out of the Paris Agreement, an agreement within the United Nations to combat greenhouse gas emissions through mitigation, adaption and finance. Trump also called for the deregulation of the fossil fuel industry in an October 2018 cabinet meeting.
The president’s neglect of environmental protection is putting all Americans at risk for his own political gain, according to Steyer.
“He is trying to accelerate climate change,” Steyer said. “He is putting us at risk for a political purpose; the support of fossil fuel companies.” 
On March 22, special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump was submitted to Attorney General William Barr. Barr provided a report to Congress summarizing the report’s general conclusions March 24. Steyer pushed for the release of the full report to ensure U.S. citizens are fully informed about Trump’s actions.
“To make these difficult decisions, it is imperative that the people have the full extent of the information surrounding the president and his advisors’ actions as well as the constitutional bases for impeachment,” Steyer said.
Need to Impeach outlines 10 primary criteria supporting the impeachment of President Trump laid out by 54 legal scholars chosen by the campaign on its website.
One of the campaign’s main criteria focuses on the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which states that the U.S. president cannot take bribes from foreign governments. 
The Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause prohibits the president from accepting personal benefits from any foreign government or official. Trump has violated this clause, because he never divested from his hotel business, according to the Need to Impeach website.
Every time a foreign official stays at a Trump hotel, Trump is accepting a bribe from a foreign official, according to Steyer. Trump has seven hotel properties located in cities across the United States, including in Washington, D.C., Las Vegas and New York. 
“You’re not allowed to take a bribe from a foreign country when you’re president of the United States and that’s in the Constitution,” Steyer said. “In the emoluments clause, do I believe that the president knows that he was taking money from foreign governments? Yes.”
Supporters of Need to Impeach have faith in their justification for impeachment and will not back down because of the president’s power and influence, according to Steyer.
“We strongly believe that what we’re doing is right, that America has to stand up for the right,” Steyer said. “And if you don’t do it under pressure because it is difficult or the person is powerful or rich, you set a precedent, and that precedent is going to be observed in the future.”

Though journalists face increasing criticism from the public, nonpartisan media organizations must continue to seek the truth through objective reporting, a panel of journalists said March 27.
Even in the face of concerns about reactions from conservative political commentators like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson, journalists still have a responsibility to provide accurate coverage, according to CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta. 
“We’re running for our lives from the conservative, right-wing attack dogs, the Hannitys and Carlsons of the world. We’re worried that they might say something bad about us, or the president might say something bad about us in a tweet,” Acosta said. “We lose sight of the fact that there are all of these people on the left and in the middle of the country who are counting on us to continue to tell the truth and hold their feet to the fire.”
Acosta was joined by Lulu Garcia-Navarro, host of NPR’s “Weekend Edition Sunday,” and Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan. The event was moderated by Doyle McManus, Los Angeles Times columnist and Georgetown’s journalism program director. 
About 65 to 70 people attended the event, which was held in the Intercultural Center auditorium. The event was the fifth annual installment in the Salim El-Lozi Lecture Series hosted by Georgetown’s undergraduate journalism program, which invites prominent journalists and scholars to Georgetown to deliver lectures and participate in panels that focus on global freedom of the press and First Amendment issues. 
Conflict over news has come to be known as “the war on truth,” according to McManus. 
“It’s not a new phenomenon to find a difficult or adversarial relationship between the government and the media,” McManus said. “But we do seem to have entered a new kind of phase, when facts are rarely accepted and when a president routinely excoriates nearly all reporters as enemies of the people.”
Right-wing news outlets purposefully seek to discredit news sources like CNN, according to Acosta. 
“We constantly have Breitbart, the Daily Caller and FoxNews.com railing against us,” said Acosta. “I think we’ve developed a thick skin, an alligator skin, where we’ve been able to understand that they’re working us over to see if they can impact our coverage.”
Attorney General William Barr presented a four-page summary of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russian interference in the 2016 election to Congress on March 22. His summary stated that Mueller had not found that Donald Trump’s campaign had taken part in a conspiracy to undermine the 2016 presidential election. 
Current criticism of nonpartisan news sources has accelerated with the release of Barr’s summary of Mueller’s report, Sullivan said. 
“There was a great deal of criticism of journalists,” Sullivan said. “They said, ‘You guys got it wrong. You perpetrated a myth. It was all fabricated.’ And I say that while there were some on Twitter, talking heads, who did fabricate, the serious journalists actually did a pretty good job covering the Russia story. We should hold our heads up and keep doing what we did.”
U.S. adults estimate that 62 percent of the news they consume through newspapers, watch on television or hear on the radio is biased, according to a 2018 Gallup poll. The same study found that 69 percent of U.S. adults say their trust in the news media has decreased in the past decade.
Social media use has contributed to the phenomenon of “the war on truth” by leading people to form increasingly partisan, rather than factual, worldviews, Garcia-Navarro said.
“With the rise of partisan media organizations, with the rise of social media, there’s a cocktail there where it is very hard for average people to distinguish between what is opinion and what is reporting,” Garcia-Navarro said. “You cannot live in a space where you do not take responsibility for who you follow, for the information that you disseminate. You are also editors now, and you have to be part of this conversation. It’s not only on us, the press. It’s on everyone.”
Preceding the 2016 election, both Hillary Clinton and Trump received coverage that was overwhelmingly negative in tone, according to a report from the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. The report is based on an analysis of news reports of major news outlets. Candidates’ policy and issue stances received very little attention, which created a biased media environment, according to the report.
Future election coverage that better serves the public should focus on issues that are important to Americans’ everyday lives, according to Sullivan.
“I would like to see the horse race coverage mixed up a bit. I’d like to see more of a citizen’s agenda that looks at what people need to know so that they can cast their votes in the most intelligent way possible,” Sullivan said. “I’d like to let those bread-and-butter interests drive the coverage rather than who’s up and who’s down.”
The public should not be deterred by the conflicts discussed in the panel and should remain confident in journalists and the country as a whole, Acosta said. 
“Despite everything that I’ve been through and the better of our company’s been through and what journalists have been through, I still have faith in my fellow human beings and faith in our business and faith in our country,” Acosta said. “I know you’re freaked out, but please continue your faith in the United States of America. I do think we are just going through a difficult time.”
