Yesterday’s senior convocation and the McCourt School of Public Policy’s commencement ceremony marked the official beginning of the 2017 graduation season — the crowning event for students nearing the end of their graduate or undergraduate studies at Georgetown.
Alice Rivlin, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and visiting professor of the McCourt School, addressed its graduates yesterday. Rivlin offered two suggestions for students seeking to address the present polarized state of U.S. politics.
“I would urge this class to do two things: The first is practice the art of engaging with people who think differently from you. … Find the other side or sides and engage them in meaningful dialogue,” Rivlin said. “Second, I would urge you to go into politics at some level — any level. Elected politics will not get better until competent, well-informed, well-motivated young people, like McCourt graduates, decide to make it better.”
Ceremonies are set to continue today with the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences commencement in the morning, followed by the McDonough School of Business graduate program and the School of Continuing Studies commencements in the afternoon.
On Saturday morning, Georgetown College students will attend their commencement, followed by ceremonies for the School of Nursing and Health Studies, the MSB undergraduate school, and the School of Foreign Service in the afternoon. Commencements conclude Sunday with the Medical School and Law Center ceremonies.
This year’s speakers include a wide range of accomplished figures, each of them set to receive honorary doctorate degrees during their visits and to impart their perspectives on graduating students.
The College: Sister Mary Scullion, R.S.M.
Georgetown College graduates will be addressed by Sister Mary Scullion, R.S.M., co-founder, president and executive director of the nonprofit organization Project HOME. Scullion co-founded the organization with current Associate Executive Director and CFO Joan Dawson McConnon in 1989.
Today, the organization operates 700 units of housing for people experiencing homelessness nationwide, as well as three businesses staffed by formerly homeless employees, according to the Project HOME website.
Previewing her speech in a question-and-answer interview posted to the Georgetown College website, Scullion offered advice for soon-to-be College graduates about how to pursue lives motivated by a pursuit of social justice.
“In addition to getting an excellent academic education, it’s equally important to work directly with, know and walk beside people in our society and in our world who are struggling and suffering — be it people on the street, immigrants or refugees,” Scullion said. “Touch the pain and suffering around us, and through that, help to affect the injustice and suffering, but you too will be transformed. Students often lead by example.”
College Dean Chester Gillis said Scullion’s speech will resonate with the graduating students and the school’s Jesuit values.
“I expect Sister Scullion to deliver a speech very much in keeping with Georgetown’s mission and values. She has devoted her life to helping the homeless. She is Jesuit educated (St. Joseph’s University) so she knows first-hand what the Jesuits stand for,” Gillis wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Scullion will also receive an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree. She is scheduled to speak Saturday at 9 a.m.
School of Continuing Studies: Nate Silver
Nate Silver, editor-in-chief of the politics and statistics blog FiveThirtyEight, will deliver the commencement address for students in the SCS. Silver, a leader in the budding field of data-driven journalism, was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the world by Time magazine in 2009 after he successfully predicted the outcome of the 2008 U.S. presidential election in 49 out of 50 states.
Since Silver founded FiveThirtyEight as an election polling analysis blog in 2008, the website has grown to include blog coverage of politics, sports, economics, science and culture.
SCS Dean Kelly Otter said the school is excited to welcome Silver, particularly because of his data-driven approach and contributions to journalism and sports.
“Mr. Silver has fundamentally changed these industries by merging data analysis with an ability to succinctly communicate an important message. We look forward to honoring him because he has influenced the way that these disciplines are taught and has inspired students to pursue truth through the use of data,” Otter wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Now more than ever, we think that’s incredibly important and worthy of distinction and celebration.”
Silver will receive an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree this weekend.
School of Foreign Service: Anne Applebaum
Washington Post political columnist Anne Applebaum, who is also a visiting professor at the London School of Economics, is scheduled to address graduating students from the SFS on Saturday at 6 p.m. Applebaum, a Washington, D.C. native, was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 2004 for her historical nonfiction book on the Soviet Gulag system, “Gulag: A History.”
In recent months, Applebaum’s column has focused on the global rise of populism and isolationism, and included sharp criticism of President Donald Trump’s campaign and administration.
In a July column, she endorsed Trump’s Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, saying Trump’s administration would welcome authoritarian leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a column published Tuesday, Applebaum said Trump is “unfit to be president.”
Applebaum will receive an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree on Saturday.
McDonough School of Business: Gregory Gerard Coleman
Graduates from the MSB’s undergraduate and graduate programs are set to hear their respective addresses from two alumni: Greg Coleman (GSB ’76), president of global media and news organization Buzzfeed, and Arthur Minson (GSB ’92), president and CFO of workspace design company WeWork. Both will also receive honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degrees.
MSB Interim Dean Rohan Williamson said the careers of Coleman and Minson serve as examples of “how our graduates can thrive” after leaving Georgetown.
“The Class of 2017 has accomplished so much during their time at Georgetown. It has been a pleasure witnessing their successes, and I look forward to seeing how they apply all they have learned here to making their unique stamp on the world,” Williamson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
School of Nursing and Health Studies: James Shelton III
Students graduating from the NHS will hear remarks delivered by James H. Shelton III, president of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company launched by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.
The company invests in three broad initiatives: science, education and technology. Shelton, former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Education, now leads the company’s education initiative, which seeks to break down barriers to high-quality education through investment.
Shelton’s work focuses on “developing breakthrough products and practices that address the needs of each student, bringing together the best teachers, researchers, advocates and engineers to tackle pressing problems,” according to the company’s website.
Other commencement speakers scheduled for the weekend include Arizona State University regents professor Emeritus Robert Cialdini, who will address the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences on Friday; National Cancer Institute chief oncologist Worta McCaskill-Stevens and University of Hawaii, Manoa law professor Charles Lawrence III, who will address Georgetown Law graduates.
All of the commencement ceremonies are available for livestreaming at the university commencement website.

Georgetown’s admissions yield for the Class of 2021 jumped to 49 percent this year, following a record low in the university’s acceptance rate and an all-time high in applications received.
The university’s admissions yield refers to the number of accepted students who submit an enrollment deposit and plan to attend Georgetown in the fall. This year’s rate is a two-percent increase from last year’s 47 percent.
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions’ target enrollment for the entire Class of 2021 increased this year for the first time in seven years to 1,600, up 20 spots from last year. Out of the 3,310 students offered admission for the Class of 2020, 1,633 enrolled, according to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69).
Deacon said the increase in the yield rate is a positive sign for the university, given the record number of applications Georgetown received this year.
With 1,633 students already enrolled, Deacon projects that around 40 students will be accepted from the waiting list. Currently, about 75 of 100 students offered a spot on a wait list remain. All students will receive a final answer by the end of June.
“We have already made some activity on the waiting list,” Deacon said. “We have admitted 25 people from the waiting list. Last year at this time, it was 80. So therefore, one of the results of having a better yield is having few spaces left for the waiting list.”
The admissions office received 21,459 regular decision applicants to the Class of 2021, up 7.3 percent from the 19,997 applicants Georgetown received in 2016. Georgetown later accepted a record-low 15.4 percent of applicants, an overall 3,310 students.
Deacon said the university offered enrollment to 1,675 students, anticipating about 75 admitted students to defer or withdraw their place because of a gap year, illness or financial constraints.
The incoming class represents every state except North Dakota and a record 172 black students, up 30 from last year. The number of Asian students and Hispanic students also increased from 206 to 227 and 169 to 183, respectively.
The incoming class’ average SAT scores increased to 1411, up eight points from last year, representing a highly accomplished incoming class.
“Considering the fact that the pool went up and the class being enrolled is 1411 in SAT versus 1403 — that’s eight points higher — it’s a stronger group, but our yield was higher,” Deacon said in an interview with The Hoya. “So that is really good, and the result is very few waitlist admits.”
Deacon also reported high yield rates in students admitted to the Community Scholars Program, a five-week academic summer program for first-generation college students, and the Georgetown Scholarship Program, a university program that provides financial support for over 625 undergraduates, many of whom are first-generation students, through access to resources and support networks.
The CSP reported a 75 percent yield, with 15 more students planning to enroll than expected, while 67 percent of students admitted to GSP and offered the program’s 1789 Scholarship, which offsets the cost of attendance usually covered by a student loan, plan to enroll.
“I don’t know if the word is out that Georgetown has a great program, but that’s the area that we did really well in,” Deacon said.
The number of foreign nationals enrolling in fall 2017 decreased slightly to 125 from last year’s 127.
Deacon said this small drop raises flags about future changes in international students considering Georgetown for higher education.
“The only number that didn’t tick up was the number of foreign nationals which is an interesting story — 125 versus 127. It didn’t go way down, but it didn’t go up,” Deacon said. “There’s been this issue about whether the climate in the country is going to impact at all the number of foreign nationals who want to come here. That number is interesting.”
Deacon said international student enrollment and applications have traditionally been driven by residents of China as a result of strong economic growth and interest in U.S. education, especially during the time span between 2004 and 2014 in which Georgetown saw a significant jump in international applications. Still, as Chinese interest in Georgetown slows, Deacon said the admissions office is looking to other Asian countries to attract.
“The large jump from 2004 to 2014 was largely influenced by China, and Asia in general. The economy in China is contracting; the growth there is probably peaking,” Deacon said. “Next is India, so we’re spending more time travelling to India. That population is particularly attuned to high-tech areas, and since we don’t have engineering, that’s probably going to limit how big a jump that will be for us.”
The total size of the student body will not change and remains tied to the 2010 Campus Plan’s 6,675 undergraduate student enrollment cap, meaning the admissions office shifted to accepting more freshmen than transfer students this cycle to fill the additional 20 seats in the Class of 2021. This increase reduced the number of transfer students accepted this year from 170 to 150 admits.
The undergraduate schools reported steady yields, with the McDonough School of Business recording the highest rate of 54 percent. The School of Foreign Service reported a 51 percent yield, the School of Nursing and Health Studies recorded a 49 percent yield and Georgetown College yielded 45 percent of its applicants.
Deacon said the MSB’s yield rate has leveled, mirroring the similar trend the MSB observed over the past two years in steady applicant numbers.
He said the lack of substantial growth in yield or applications for the MSB could reflect a shift in applicants’ interest for the humanities and social sciences, as Georgetown College experienced a bump in applicants this cycle, and a stabilizing job market and improving national economic environment.
“The pressure students were facing after the financial crisis was going into a program where they could get jobs afterward,” Deacon said. “It seems that that may be reversing a little bit. People see there is more uncertainty than there used to be. So committing to something fully as opposed to being just generally well-educated is something people are beginning to think about.”

This year’s admission cycle saw an increase in the number of legacy students accepted, with 30 percent of legacy applicants offered admittance to Georgetown, compared to a 15.4 percent acceptance rate for all applicants.
Legacy students are expected to comprise 10 percent of the Class of 2021, demonstrating a persistent trend in which children of Georgetown alumni are more likely to be accepted even as the Office of Admissions looks to recruit a more diverse student body.
The legacy acceptance rate was 25 percent for the Class of 2020 and 37 percent for the Class of 2019. Legacy students accounted for 5 percent of this year’s total applicant pool.
Feeder schools, which are defined as the top 10 schools that provide the most applicants to Georgetown, complement legacy status in some cases, according to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon. These schools end up contributing to a less diverse student population.
While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions does not actively recruit legacy students, it does consider family ties to the university when evaluating students of equal academic standing, and gives preference to students with legacy status in those cases.
Deacon said the current legacy pool tends to be made up from the East Coast, demonstrating the need to engage younger, more diverse alumni and students from a greater range of schools.
Legacy students “are more likely to be white, whereas in 20 years they are much more likely to be various students of color,” Deacon said. “We’re so anxious to get new graduates involved because they are much more diverse than the traditional alumni body would be. That’s one of the positive representations of the university in different communities across the country.”
Although the profile of the admitted legacy pool is similar to the overall profile of all admitted students, Deacon said socio-economic and racial diversity remains an issue.
“Diversity is a lagging factor. It is more typically because you’re talking about people who graduated 20 years ago, you’re talking about the ‘Old Georgetown,’ and it has been changing along the way,” Deacon said.
Deacon said the legacy tip factor is taken into account when applicants are outstanding candidates.
“If you have three or four or five competitive candidates who look pretty much the same, at the edge there will be a tip factor for some legacies if they have a long record of being involved with the university,” Deacon said. “They annually give to the annual fund, or do alumni interviews or are active in their club activities. There are records kept of that.”
Deacon said the projected shift in the demographic makeup of alumni is coupled with a shift in feeder schools that provide a significant number of applicants to the university.
“Out of 21,500 applicants, about four or five thousand are schools from which there is one applicant,” Deacon said. “Most Georgetown alumni have done well, and they want their children to do well, so they live in school districts with good schools or they will send their kids to private schools or maybe to the network of historic Jesuit schools.”
For example, in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, public schools like Walt Whitman High School and McLean High School; private schools like Gonzaga College High School, Georgetown Preparatory School and Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School; and magnet schools like Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology dominate the regional application numbers.
These typical feeder schools differ from target schools used to encourage more diverse communities to apply to Georgetown.
Deacon said the admissions office has begun to look at magnet and charter schools to supplement traditional feeder schools.
“The best route to more competitive colleges for students from lower income backgrounds is through the magnet school process, if they are able to,” Deacon said. “They become in and of themselves, feeder schools, even if they are not elite.”
Deacon said Georgetown relies on target schools to drive diverse applicants to apply each year, but as students in elite private schools or top public schools tend to apply to top-tier schools, Georgetown ends up competing for the same pool of students.
“It’s a challenge. Obviously, it is very much connected to socio-economics,” Deacon said. “If you are saying Georgetown is not diverse enough, we ought to be visiting non-traditional, lower income high schools, the question is which ones? Where do you begin?”
Deacon said magnet schools like the Bronx High School of Science and charter school networks like the BASIS Schools of Arizona are emerging as good indicators of diversity and academic excellence, though some charter schools can end up excluding students if admissions are administered through a lottery system.
Charter schools “take advantage of public funds and yet are in very elite communities. They are actually able to create elite private schools using public funds,” Deacon said. “On the one hand, charter schools give us places to point to, but on the other hand, we know that kids get left behind further by that process.”
According to Deacon, when students choose Georgetown over other highly competitive schools, they tend to come from non-traditional schools.
“When we win from Harvard, it’s more likely to be a [Georgetown Scholarship Program] student, than it is an affluent family,” Deacon said. “That’s one of the nice things, that there are no preconceived notions in most cases of what’s best.”

Several students will be honored as valedictorians and Dean’s Medal recipients for maintaining the highest GPA in their respective schools this commencement weekend, with a two-way tie in the McDonough School of Business.
Anneke von Seeger (COL ’17), the College valedictorian, will lead the commencement as the Georgetown College Marshal. Caitlin Miller (COL ’17), a government and theology major, attained the second-highest GPA in the College with a 3.978, and will deliver the Cohongorouton address, similar to a valedictorian address, at tomorrow’s Tropaia ceremony. Nicole Colarusso (MSB ’17), an international business and finance major, and Katherine Wildes (MSB ’17), an accounting and operations and information management major, who earned 3.991 GPAs, will both address the MSB convocation ceremony tomorrow.
Allyn Rosenberger (NHS ’17), a health care management and policy major, will receive the Dean’s Medal for the School of Nursing and Health Studies for her 4.0 GPA, while James Pavur (SFS ’17), a science, technology and international affairs major, will receive the Dean’s Medal for the School of Foreign Service for his 3.971 GPA. Neither the NHS or SFS formally name valedictorians.
Miller’s achievement was a result of her perseverance in her academic studies.
“I always operate that I just try to do my personal best,” Miller said. “I love meeting with professors, talking about ideas, just the process is a joy to me. The process of receiving comments on papers and things, and things I didn’t do so well, things I can improve on.”
In her address tomorrow, she plans to focus on the role of the Georgetown community in developing its students.
“At Georgetown, all of us have been blessed with people who already see us as the best person we can become,” Miller said. “People who see within us our potential, our capacity, and by seeing us this way they reveal that possibility to us. They show us what we can achieve, even if we are not able to see it in ourselves.”
Pavur focused on the importance of Georgetown’s student body in his convocation address today. Georgetown’s diversity offers students rare opportunities, according to Pavur.
“That’s the biggest reflection for me, that I was able to make friends with a lot of people who weren’t exact mirror images of me and who weren’t part of my bubble,” Pavur said.
In November, Pavur was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to pursue a Ph.D. in cybersecurity at Oxford next year.
Colarusso and Wildes plan to deliver a joint address in the structure of a Jesuit Examen, with one offering reflections on the past and the other on the future. Wildes said she hopes to advocate the importance of balance in her address.
“Georgetown has a culture that’s very focused on high achievement and intellectual curiosity, and I think learning to say ‘no’ to certain things so that I could say ‘yes’ to other things has been a really important part of my experience,” Wildes said.
Taking advantage of the diversity in Georgetown’s community is important to success, according to Wildes.
“Use kind of the shared experiences that we have here and kind of the openness that everyone comes with when they come to college as a platform for exploring our differences,” Wildes said.
Colarusso said it was a combination of academic passion and support from family and friends that led to her academic success.
“It’s kind of just a combination of things, but I would stress more so than anything, surrounding yourself with people that can help you along the way,” Colarusso said.
An interest in interdisciplinary studies unites this year’s group of valedictorians. All five students are either double majors or are majoring in interdisciplinary fields such as international business, healthcare management and policy, or science, technology and international affairs.
A passion to study the two things that affect people’s lives most — their nation and their faith — drove Miller to study government and theology.
“I study nations and God, the two things that motivate people, what people live and die for,” Miller said. “In a certain way it is my wish to understand people better that causes me to study both.”
Rosenberger said she hopes to unify a passion for health care and policy to improve the lives of others.
“I am particularly interested in public health policy and looking at the ways in which law and policy can be used to improve the health of communities,” Rosenberger said. “I’ve always been really passionate about health and ensuring marginalized people in vulnerable communities have access to the things that build healthy communities.”
Although exploring diverse subject matters is important, pursuing one’s passions outside of the classroom is equally important, according to Pavur.
Pavur said he was able to explore his passions in hackathons outside of the classroom.
“I love going and making something new, and kind of forcing myself to learn something on the spot, normally sleep deprived and caffeinated, it’s a lot of fun, and so I think that was a big part of my Georgetown experience,” Pavur said.
Rosenberger said working to coordinate the OWN IT summit, which seeks to empower female students, has had the most significant influence on her outside of the classroom.
“Every year it celebrates feminism and cultivates a new group of confident young women to go out in the world and engage with some of the most important issues of our time, and participating in that planning process and engaging with both our attendees and speakers just has had the most profound impact on me,” Rosenberger said.
To Miller, commencement is not a celebration of individuals, but rather the collective Georgetown community.
“When we’re celebrating, we’re not celebrating each individual isolated person, we’re celebrating this type of community that we have here, this community of support and interconnection,” Miller said. “It’s those interpersonal relationships that help us get to wherever we are in our lives and will continue to be the fabric of that.”
Clarification: An earlier version of this article excluded Anneke von Seeger (COL ’17), the College valedictorian who attained the highest GPA in the school.

The Office of the Provost and the Georgetown University Student Association recognized outstanding members of the university’s faculty and staff through a series of honors awarded at the end of the 2016-17 academic year.
Computer science professor Cal Newport, English professor Daniel Shore, security studies professor Christine Fair, physics professor Emanuela Del Gado and psychology professor Rebecca Ryan were recognized by the Office of the Provost with this academic year’s Distinguished Associate Professor awards after being nominated by department chairs, unit heads and academic deans.
The distinction recognizes associate professors who, at an early stage in their careers, have made remarkable achievements in research and teaching, according to the Office of the Provost’s official web portal.
Department chairs and units heads nominate candidates, who a team of university and endowed chaired professors judge. The team then forwards selections to Provost Robert Groves for approval.
Newport, whose most recent book, “Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,” was a Wall Street Journal Business Bestseller, highlighted the value of Georgetown’s academic culture and students in his work.
“Georgetown’s intellectual culture, its values, and its fantastic students combine to make it an ideal academic home for my teaching and scholarship,” Newport wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m proud to be a part of this institution and honored that they selected me for this distinction.”
Shore, who is currently working on building “Six Degrees of Francis Bacon,” a digital representation of the Early Modern Social Network that allows users to identify connections and relationships between contemporary historical figures, lauded the university for supporting his endeavors.
“Georgetown has done a remarkable job of supporting my work, both in the classroom, where I get to explore difficult texts and pursue complicated ideas with brilliant and engaged students, and in the library carrel, where I get to try out new methods of inquiry and push the limits of disciplinary knowledge,” Shore said.
“I’m grateful that Georgetown has honored me for the work it has made it possible for me to do,” Shore said.
In addition to these recognitions, GUSA presented the annual Dorothy Brown Award, honoring a faculty member whose contributions show a strong commitment to the educational advancement of students, to biology professor Heidi Elmendorf on April 28.
Elmendorf, who was previously awarded the D.C. Professor of the Year Award on 2014 by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, co-founded the biology of global health major in 2009 and also serves as director of the educational partnership between the biology department and the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, a Washington, D.C. public high school.
Elmendorf is also a finalist for the $250,000 Robert Foster Cherry Award for Great Teaching sponsored by Baylor University. As a finalist, Elmendorf received $15,000, as well as $10,000 for her department. She will also present a series of lectures at Baylor and Georgetown during fall 2017.
In addition to nominating faculty members for the Dorothy Brown Award, students were also given the opportunity to nominate staff members for the three Staff Appreciation Awards, created last year and presented by GUSA on April 28: the Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam Award, the Patrick Healy Award and the Unsung Hero Award.
Per an email sent by GUSA to the student body, the Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam Award, first awarded in 2008, recognizes an individual who has influenced student life through programs and initiatives that support students and allow them to thrive on campus. The Patrick Healy Award is presented to an individual who has fostered inclusivity on campus, and the Unsung Hero Award recognizes a staff member who has shown outstanding commitment to serving Georgetown community without seeking recognition.

The School of Foreign Service in Qatar graduated its ninth senior class in a commencement ceremony featuring members of the Qatari royal family and university officials May 4.
This year’s graduating class consisted of 62 students, with 40 women and 22 men receiving the Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service degree, the same degree given to students in the SFS on the main campus.
The BSFS degree program trains students to resolve important global issues and develops their knowledge of the world in combination with critical thinking and communication skills.
This year’s commencement follows last year’s record-high graduating class size of 68 students. The class of 2017 will join more than 340 graduates who have graduated from the university since its opening in Qatar’s Education City in 2005.
His Excellency Sheikh Abdulla bin Ali Al-Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family and a member of Georgetown University’s board of directors, gave the commencement address. Sheikh Abdulla also serves as an adviser to the Amiri Diwan of Qatar, the center of the country’s government.
Sheikh Abdulla discussed the importance of cooperation and said it was an integral component to success, much like how Qatar relies on cooperation with neighboring states in an effort to bring progress in the Arab world.
“Great achievements require collaboration,” Sheikh Abdulla said.
Sheikh Abdulla said he was proud watching the members of the class of 2017 overcome challenges during their undergraduate careers.
“They broke through obstacles on the road to graduation and the dreams that lie beyond,” Sheikh Abdulla said.
SFS-Q Dean James Reardon-Anderson said commencement marks the graduating class moving closer to making a difference in the world.
“It is a time when we reflect on the achievements of our senior students,” Reardon-Anderson said in his commencement address. “I want to congratulate the Class of 2017 on their accomplishments to date, and wish them well for the future, as they continue on the path to being lifelong learners, and engage the unpredictable world that lies before them.”
University President John J. DeGioia travelled to Qatar along with other members of the university leadership to attend the event.
DeGioia said he hopes that the graduates will use their education to carry out Georgetown’s mission and make the world a better place for everyone.
“During their time here at Georgetown, our students have contributed to our scholarship and learning in significant ways, enlivening our mission with their passion and talents, and engaging in service to impact the lives of people across our world,” DeGioia said. “We are deeply proud of all they have accomplished and who they have become, and wish them all the best as they begin this next stage of their journey.”

A new method for autism spectrum disorder screening in children of Latinx families, developed by Georgetown University Medical Center autism specialists, was presented at the International Meeting for Autism Research in San Francisco from May 10 to 13.
The new screening method includes conducting interviews with families of children who may have autism to determine if further testing was warranted, as opposed to the standard method of requiring parents to fill out a questionnaire asking them to describe their child’s behavior.
Many parents, especially those in Latinx and immigrant communities, found the questionnaires problematic, according to Deputy Director of GUMC Center for Child and Human Development Bruno Anthony, who led the research team.
“What we learned very clearly through the parents was that they did not like filling out forms,” Anthony said. “Sometimes they were hard to understand, there were literacy issues, there was concerns about where those forms would go and trust issues. What they really preferred was having a face-to-face discussion and having somebody talk them through the forms so that they could understand them.”
Rather than asking parents to fill out forms, Anthony’s team encouraged doctors to meet with parents and their children to conduct interviews to determine if the children needed to undergo further testing for autism. Doctors were reluctant at first, believing the interviews would take too long, according to Anthony. To quell these concerns, the team offered “family navigators” in lieu of doctors to conduct the interviews.
“We started the process by having family navigators who were bicultural, bilingual people from the community who actually had kids who had some kind of developmental problem, which they had sought services for in the past. So they were very knowledgeable, and they were able to link and engage very well with the Latino families,” Anthony said.
As the 18-month study progressed, doctors at the hospital gradually took over the interviewing duties, having discovered that the interviews were reasonably short.
Since the study was completed at Unity Health Care Upper Cardozo Health Center in 2014, the Washington, D.C. hospital fully implemented the new model for testing for autism. Anthony believes that similar methods have the potential to work at health care facilities across the nation, but only if they are carefully implemented and the surrounding community is considered.
“Each place that wants to do it has to go through the same process that we went through — talking with families, thinking about their staff needs, thinking about the things that would get in the way, the things that would facilitate, and see how this kind of method would work,” Anthony said. “I think it can, but it has to be done in a way that makes sense to the site and the community around it.”
Though important, screening is only the first step for children at risk of autism, according to Anthony. He said it is important that families follow up with further testing and early prevention measures if necessary.
“The important thing is what happens when there’s concerns raised about the outcome. So if the form suggests that the child might be at risk, then there has to be the next step, which is the most important in getting the family to agree to go to the next stage of assessment, which is more intense,” Anthony said. “Screening is only the first step.”

Elite universities can afford to admit a much larger amount of low-income Pell Grant recipients without significantly hurting their graduation rates or budgets, according to a report released by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce on May 2.
The report, authored by CEW Director Anthony Carnevale and Martin Van Der Werf, CEW associate director of editorial and postsecondary policy, finds that 69 percent of the most selective private colleges ran average annual budget surpluses of $139 million over the last four years, but fewer than 20 percent of undergraduate students they admitted were Pell Grant recipients.
The report also finds that many Pell Grant recipients are statistically qualified to attend top-tier universities, scoring at or above the median mark on standardized tests of students at selective colleges.
“Highly-qualified Pell Grant students are being turned away from the opportunity for an elite college education, which is more and more open only to the wealthy,” Carnevale said in the May 2 press release.
According to Van Der Werf, he and Carnevale both believe that admitting a class with at least 20 percent receiving Pell Grants is a fair and reachable goal for all colleges and universities. Most selective U.S. colleges fall significantly short of this goal. Overall, more than 72,000 additional Pell-receiving students would have to be admitted to 346 colleges and universities to meet that standard, according to the report.
About 13 percent of all Georgetown students were Pell Grant recipients in the 2014-15 school year, the most recent year for which data is available, according to a U.S. News and World Report analysis. To reach 20 percent Pell students, Georgetown would need 536 more students receiving Pell Grants.
“Competitive pressures keep elite colleges from admitting low-income students even when they are qualified,” Van Der Werf wrote in an email to The Hoya. “If the colleges themselves won’t change their admissions policies, it’s worth considering whether we should require a minimum enrollment standard of 20 percent Pell Grant recipients.”
Recent attempts have been made to increase low-income representation in elite universities. Bipartisan federal legislation proposed in September 2016 by Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Sen. Christopher Coons (D-Del.) would require colleges with the lowest ratio of Pell Grant recipients to admit more low-income students. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, but never came to a vote.
Van Der Werf said such a federal bill has the potential to bring Pell-receiving student enrollment to about 20 percent in selective U.S. colleges.
Increasing the amount of low-income students at selective colleges and universities would allow for increased access to better academic resources, higher graduation rates and greater post-graduation earning potential, as well as increased equality across the socio-economic spectrum, according to Van Der Wertf.
“If selective colleges enrolled more Pell Grant recipients, a high-quality postsecondary education would be spread across a broader group of students, instead of preserving elite educations for students who, for the most part, are already elite,” Van Der Werf wrote.
Van Der Werf said he recognizes a major barrier to reaching the 20 percent solution. With mandated 20 percent Pell Grant enrollment, elite colleges would have to accept a substantially different group of students than they would otherwise select, choosing lower-scoring Pell students over slightly higher-scoring others. However, he said this obstacle can be overcome.
“Some of the finest universities in America enroll more than 20 percent Pell Grant students, including Columbia, Emory, [New York University], [University of Southern California], Amherst, Smith, the University of California at Berkeley, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,” Van Der Werf wrote. “If these universities have figured out a way to make this work, other elite universities can do so, too.”
