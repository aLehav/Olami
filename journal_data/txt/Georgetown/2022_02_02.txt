The Hoya sat down with Thomas Leonard (COL ’23), who is running for Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) President, and Nirvana Khan (SFS ’24), who is running alongside Leonard for GUSA Vice President, to discuss their plans if elected. Voting opens Feb. 10 and closes Feb. 12. 
If elected, what are your top priorities?
Leonard: First is the basic needs of all students, because we want to make sure that your residential living and dining experience is the best one that it can be and that our mental health pandemic is taken as seriously by the administration as it possibly can be. 
The second core area of focus for us is fostering an equitable community and making sure that the voices of all of the different identities on this campus are reflected in the decisions that we make as an administration. 
Our third focus is really emphasizing the student voice, working with other campus organizations to make sure that our platform and the work that we’re doing is in line with what their needs are and that GUSA stands as an ally to the broader student body and no longer will exist as an organization that doesn’t do everything in their power to make sure that every voice is accounted for.
Khan: I really want to be a voice for the AAPI [Asian American Pacific Islander] community on campus and work on things such as creating more cultural safe spaces on campus, creating a residential community for the AAPI community, working on the race, ethnicity and migration studies program that’s been proposed by a number of campus groups, as well as increasing our coordination with local mutual aid organizations. 
Something else that we’re both really prioritizing on our platform is accessibility. A lot of campus spaces are inaccessible. A lot of professors don’t really face long-term consequences for not meeting accommodations. That’s something we really want to support, because it’s crucial that everybody has an equal access to the Georgetown experience.
Many students in the campus community are confused about GUSA and feel that it is ineffective. What do you think sets you apart from previous GUSA presidents and vice presidents? 
Khan: COVID really did act as a setback. It erased a lot of institutional history and knowledge and raised questions about GUSA’s presence on campus and how to bring that back. We want to ramp up the social programming for GUSA members and become a more tight-knit community. We want to do a complete overhaul of our communications. We want to set up formal meetings with student organizations, which hasn’t ever been a part of GUSA. 
How do you hope to change, if at all, interaction between the GUSA exec and the administration?
Leonard: Nirvana and I are in a particularly unique position in that we have existing relationships with campus administration. It’s much easier for us to present the needs of the student body and work collaboratively with them and make sure that everything they’re doing is in line with what the student body needs.
Your platform calls for the reinstatement of student guards in residence halls. Do you think this is truly the most effective solution to addressing the residential safety issue and those concerns?
Khan: The people we’ve spoken to feel just a little bit safer when we recognize the person working at the desk, or when we know there is another student that just adds a layer of safety. We definitely want to make sure that in increasing residential safety, we don’t make anybody feel uncomfortable by the presence of additional guards. 
How do you plan to pressure the university to act on the GU272 referendum?
Leonard: Nirvana and I both had the privilege of taking part in a revitalization of the pushes for the GU272 Advocacy Team movements, and we have overseen the creation of a grant review committee that is currently being overseen by the Office of the President in conjunction with Nirvana, myself and other members of this current GUSA administration. 
Financial reparations are not enough. And having screens in Sellinger with names … it’s not enough. We want to work very closely with President DeGioia to make sure that the university faces its history in a much more meaningful way. We want to work very closely with the master planning consortium to make sure that we have physical spaces on campus dedicated to reconciliation with our history, not only with the horrible nature of slavery, but the Jesuits’ role in the global space.

Khari Brown, local nonprofit CEO, has received the “Legacy of a Dream” award from Georgetown University. 
Brown, CEO of Capital Partners for Education (CPE), a nonprofit that provides mentorship for low-income students in Washington, D.C., received the award from President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) on Jan. 17. Since 2003, the John R. Thompson Jr. “Legacy of a Dream” award has been granted to local leaders who have completed meaningful civil rights, children’s rights or humanitarian work in their community. The award, which is presented to recipients on Martin Luther King Jr. Day each year, is named in honor of John Thompson Jr., former Georgetown head basketball coach.
Brown said that it is a privilege to receive an award associated with prominent civil rights leaders. 
“This award is the greatest honor I’ve ever received, and it’s also extremely meaningful for our organization,” Brown wrote to The Hoya. “To be associated with leaders like Martin Luther King, and John Thompson is beyond my wildest dreams, and I hope this special recognition helps us bring more attention to the need for promoting economic mobility for Black and Brown young people in our community.” 
Mentorship has proven to be an essential component of Brown’s work, according to DeGioia. 
“His leadership shows the power of mentorship as a tool to bring out the very best in our young people and enable them to thrive,” DeGioia said during a live virtual presentation of the award.
Under Brown’s leadership, CPE expanded from mentoring 50 students annually to working with nearly 500 students. Nearly 61% of students who work with CPE graduate from college — triple the national average among similar students — and 88% of its 2020 high school class enrolled in college within one year of graduating from high school. 
Despite these successes, disparities in education continue to rise, often influenced by socioeconomic factors beyond students’ control, according to Brown.
“Educational outcomes are too often determined by zip code, race and family income,” Brown wrote to The Hoya. “Change is needed in many areas, including at a national policy level in addressing the systemic inequities in our country and the DC community that make educational success and economic mobility so hard to achieve for the young people we serve.”
CPE initially started as a scholarship program for low-income students looking to attend private schools. It soon turned into a mentorship and career-focused program that saw growing demand from D.C. public and charter schools. Brown’s priority then shifted to focus on first generation college students who remain affected by unequal opportunities in the District.
Brown identified a group of underserved students known as the “academic middle” — students whose grade point average fell between 2.3 and 3.1 and have the potential to go to college but lack the resources and support — to receive CPE mentoring.
Education and equal opportunities for all students are essential components of building a more equitable society, according to Moisés Alvarez (SFS ’23), a student who was involved with CPE throughout high school.
“Khari’s work is social justice, with a focus on income inequality and racial disparities in the education system,” Alvarez wrote to The Hoya. “I believe education is the great equalizer, and it makes an invaluable difference in the lives of young people who can dream of a better future. In our DC community today, we see so much unrealized potential in students who do not have the resources and access to take the next step at a college education, if that’s what they want to pursue.”
Khari’s work continued at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, when CPE began conducting their programs virtually and increased its funding by more than 500%, providing monetary resources for students and their families to help them pay rent and buy essential items. 
CPE and Brown continue to change students’ lives even after they graduate from the traditional mentorship programs, according to Alvarez.
“My education is a stepping stone for me to go on into the professional world and make an impact in my community,” Alvarez wrote. “CPE has been a pivotal player in all this. When I joined at 14 years old I was paired with a mentor, with whom I keep in touch today.”

The Hoya sat down with Kole Wolfe (SFS ’24), who is running for Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) President, and Zeke Ume-Ukeje (COL ’24), who is running alongside Wolfe for GUSA Vice President, to discuss their plans if elected. Voting opens Feb. 10 and closes Feb. 12. 
[Disclaimer: Kole Wolfe served as a Staff Writer for The Hoya in spring 2021.]
If elected, what are your top priorities? 
Ume-Ukeje: We have a couple ideas about general GUSA meetings, like every once in a while opening it up to students on campus by just allowing them to come into the meetings and give their ideas and voice their concerns. That way, people can actually come in and tell us what they want to see changed, what’s going on in their dorm, what’s going on at Leo’s [Georgetown’s primary dining hall], whatever it might be, so we can hear it. 
Wolfe: There is one thing that we actually had a lot of thoughts about: club culture. We’re working on getting in contact with the Center for Social Justice about a plan to create low barrier to entry clubs targeted on direct impact in the Georgetown community. 
Many students in the campus community are confused about GUSA and feel that it is ineffective. What do you think sets you apart from previous GUSA presidents and vice presidents? 
Ume-Ukeje: We feel like we represent a good portion of the student body, and we don’t really know what’s going on with GUSA. We weren’t really too aware of how their work is affecting our day to day life. We wanted to just bring complete transparency, whether that’s weekly emails, whether that’s a more active social media page, whether that’s putting more stuff on our own personal Instagram accounts to let students know about what’s going on. 
Wolfe: I think part of it is just there needs to be a more streamlined way of getting things done. I know there are referendums that they put through, I just think there needs to be a lot more direct student input instead of getting bogged down in the bureaucratic ways of sort of governing.
How do you hope to change, if at all, interactions between GUSA exec and the administration?
Wolfe: We’ll go into it looking to establish a positive relationship early and often. I think part of it is putting up some resistance when needed and speaking for what students actually want, because there is obviously sometimes an apparent disconnect between the administration and the student body and some policies that they’re implementing. 
Ume-Ukeje: I think sometimes when GUSA speaks with the administration, the administration sees it as speaking with just another organization, as opposed to just a couple people who represent the student body and what the students really want to see happen on campus. At the end of the day, we’re just two normal students. We’re not trying to put ourselves on a pedestal by being GUSA president and vice president, we’re just there to speak for how the students feel. I think that’s sort of something that’s not really there right now.
What do you think is the most effective solution to addressing residential safety issues? 
Wolfe: I think one of the things that could definitely be done is forming an association of students who live in each dorm, not to actually take direct action but to be vigilant. Obviously the RAs have a lot of responsibility already, but if there was just some sort of team who would scan the hallways for one minute every night on their different respective floors, just trying to keep in mind that, ‘Okay, we’re probably going to be safe, but you know, safety is priority number one. And then, okay, I look down the hallway, I see some dude with a knife. That means it’s time to call some serious backup.’
Ume-Ukeje: There could be resources devoted to hiring professional security guards, obviously taking a hands-off approach and not really being too present, but in case the need arises where there’s a clear threat to students’ safety, they have the training and the wherewithal to step in and make sure that no one gets hurt.
How do you plan to pressure the university to act on the GU272 referendum?Ume-Ukeje: We want to make sure that the university is holding up their end of the bargain, whatever that might be. I don’t know what that bargain was, I don’t know what deal they struck. But it feels like this issue is being avoided a little bit too much. So we want to, number one, pressure for transparency. Once you step up the noise levels, then they’re going to be forced to make a move to correct their lack of movements so far.
This article was updated on Feb. 3 to clarify Wolfe’s previous role at The Hoya.

A Georgetown University professor has received a prestigious honor for her work in the field of classical Arabic poetry.
Suzanne Stetkevych, Sultan Qaboos bin Said Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies in the department of Arabic and Islamic studies, was named a 2022 King Faisal Prize laureate for Arabic language and literature by the King Faisal Foundation, which aims to benefit the field of Islamic studies. Stetkevych will be formally recognized in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in March 2022. 
This year’s King Faisal Prize specifically focused on works of Arabic literature in English, which is where Stetkevych’s expertise and experience lies.  
“All of my work has been in classical Arabic poetry for many years now, so that’s primarily what they’re looking at,” Stetkevych said in an interview with The Hoya. “I have publications in Arabic, as well as in English, that are fairly well known in the Arab world.”
Stetkevych was honored because of her ability to connect Arabic studies to a wide range of concentrations, according to Abdulaziz Alsebail, secretary general of the King Faisal Prize.
“Her research approach is renowned for its solid theoretical base and its application of varied methodologies drawn from anthropology, literary theory, structuralism, post-structuralism, folklore studies and the history of religions,” Alsebail wrote to The Hoya. “This approach resulted in the renewal of the critical perspective and methods of studying Classical Arabic ode culminating in the establishing of a distinguished and distinct school in the study of Arabic literature.” 
Her extensive work in the field includes looking at ritual patterns and applying ideas from other topics, such as mythology, comparative religions and poetry, Stetkevych said. She has published research and poetry collections in both Arabic and English.
Colleagues within the department of Arabic and Islamic studies were excited — but not surprised — that Stetkevych is receiving this elite honor, according to Elliot Colla, chair of the Arabic and Islamic studies department.
“While Prof. Stetkevych has been a leader in the field of classical Arabic studies for many years now it is not just because of her pathbreaking scholarship,” Colla wrote to The Hoya. “She has been a tireless teacher, mentor, and colleague. Her generosity is well known by anyone who has studied with her or worked with her. I can’t think of a better person to receive such an important award. 
The King Faisal Foundation presents awards in five categories: service to Islam, Islamic studies, Arabic language and literature, medicine and science. Eligibility requirements for the Arabic language and literature award include publishing an original work on the announced topic of the prize, having knowledge of the subject and meeting at least one criteria set forth by the selection committee. 
Reflected in the King Faisal Foundation is an increasing global interest in Arabic literature, as well as other Islamic studies in the humanities, according to Stetkevych. 
“There’s an interest now, especially with the King Faisal Foundation, in encouraging the Arab Islamic world on one side, but also the broader world and Western world and others to build more bridges and to engage with each other much more in the fields of humanities,” Stetkevych told The Hoya. “With the idea that this is kind of the basis for what I would call civilized human exchange. Cultural exchange is really a foundation for human interaction.”
Prior to 2022, only one American scholar had received the Arabic language and literature award. This year, Stetkevych is being honored for the award alongside Muhsin Al-Musawi of Columbia University. Stetkevych is the first woman to receive the award since 1994. 
Stetkevych is a revolutionary force in the field of Arabic poetry because she analyzes texts in their original, performative context, according to Colla. 
“Prof. Stetkevych is that rare scholar who doesn’t merely work within a field, but creates a new one in the process. Before Stetkevych, it was common for scholars to approach classical Arabic poetry as a collection of beautiful lines, each one worthy of admiration in its own right,” Colla wrote. “Drawing upon anthropology and performance studies, Prof. Stetkevych pioneered a method for seeing poems not as a collection of lines but as coherent, integrated works.”
Stetkevych, who spent time in Arab regions throughout her career, believes that Arabic poetry is something that can be appreciated by everyone. 
“This is a literature that’s part of the universal human heritage,” Stetkevych said. “Therefore, it is open for anyone to study and anyone to contribute to.”

CW: This article discusses genocide and violence. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Several students have signed a letter demanding Georgetown University investigate its endowment to screen for the presence of ties to human rights abuses in China. 
The Jan. 23 letter, titled “An Open Letter Calling for Divestment from Ongoing Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity,” calls on Georgetown University to divest the university’s endowment from companies that are linked to the repression and forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic groups in China. The letter was co-authored by the Muslim Student Association (MSA) and the Hong Kong Student Association (HKSA), alongside individual students from across the campus community.  
Georgetown has a duty to investigate any potential financial holdings related to the Chinese government’s abuse of Uyghurs, according to Christopher Boose (COL ’22), who helped to prepare the original letter.
“Even if the University thinks its investments are clean, they have a duty to check and publicly commit themselves against the Uyghur genocide,” Boose wrote to The Hoya. “At a school as proud of its values as Georgetown, there’s no excuse for not taking a stand on an issue as fundamental as genocide.” 
The letter was modeled after similar demands by students at the Catholic University of America, according to Boose, who also said students at universities across the country have also called upon their respective schools to cut financial ties with Uyghur human rights abuses. 
The Chinese government has persecuted Uyghurs and other Turkic, Muslim-majority groups for decades in the Uyghur Region, which the Chinese government refers to as Xinjiang. China’s current policies include the arbitrary detention of up to one million people, mainly Uyghurs, severe restrictions on religious practice and repressive population control, including forced sterilization. Hundreds of international companies — including Apple and Microsoft, which Georgetown holds stock in — are at a high risk of taking part in the forced labor of Uyghurs. 
Georgetown has a moral responsibility to divest and ensure it’s endowment is not tied to genocide, according to John Metz, executive director of the Athenai Institute, a bi-partisan student-led non-profit that seeks to limit Beijing’s influence on U.S. college campuses. The institute helped prepare the Georgetown letter. 
“Divestment is a practical and moral necessity,” Metz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “By divesting, Georgetown has an opportunity to ensure its financial independence from a genocidal regime.”
The letter also urges the university to promote research and dialogue on the human rights crisis facing Uyghurs. Alongside the co-authoring student organizations, original sponsors of the letter include the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition (GBC), Georgetown University College Republicans (GUCR) and Georgetown University College Democrats (GUCD). 
The university should consider human rights in all of its investments, according to a statement from the HKSA board. 
“We encourage the University to consider the human rights implications of all its investments, programs, and activities — whether this be in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, or anywhere else in the world,” the HKSA statement read. 
The Muslim Student Association did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment. 
Georgetown students should support efforts to investigate the endowment, according to Matteo Caulfield (COL ’23), president of GBC. 
“Holding China accountable for its violations of basic human rights is a cause we should all get behind no matter our political background in the United States,” Caulfield wrote to The Hoya. “As Georgetown students, we have the responsibility to reflect on our global impact and eradicate any connection we bear to international crimes.”
The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate unanimously passed a resolution at a meeting held Jan. 31 requesting the university to provide more transparency about the endowment. 
GUSA Senator Dominic Gordon (SFS ’24), who co-sponsored the resolution after signing onto the letter, said any ties to the Chinese government’s atrocities against the Uyghurs is unacceptable. 
“This issue is important to me because as a Jewish American, I firmly believe that no ethnic group should ever face an attempt to eliminate it. I believe that the Chinese government’s behavior points to that direction,” Gordon wrote to The Hoya. 
It’s essential that students raise this issue whenever possible because a sustained dialogue will be critical to find ways to respond to these atrocities, according to Peter Irwin, a senior program officer at the Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group the Uyghur Human Rights Project.
“The first step for Georgetown — or any institution for that matter — would be to meticulously review their investments to ensure there is no connection to the treatment of Uyghurs,” Irwin wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The composition of endowments sends a message, according to Jeffrey Ngo (GRD ’24), a doctoral candidate studying history, who signed the letter.  
“How an educational institution allocates its endowment sends a powerful message about the social values it endorses,” Ngo wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our university community is diverse. Many members — including Hong Kongers like me — are directly facing the repression of the Chinese government every single day.”  
Human rights and values already guide Georgetown’s investment practices, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Georgetown’s Socially Responsible Investing Policy (SRI Policy) aligns the university’s investments to protecting human life and dignity, as well as social justice and the promotion of the common good,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The SRI policy, which was put into effect in June 2017, was established by these guidelines, according to the spokesperson. 
The push for the university to investigate the endowments offers students the ability to protest the actions of the Chinese government within the campus community, according to Ngo.
“The divestment campaign offers a potential for me to make an impact for a cause that’s personal to me — in this case, protesting genocide perpetuated by the Chinese government against Uyghurs in Xinjiang — while focusing on my own university community. That’s why I’m doing my part to push the letter forward by signing it and spreading it,” Ngo wrote. 
On-campus resources include Health Education Services (202-687-8949) and Counseling and Psychiatric Service (202-687-6985); additional off-campus resources include the National Alliance on Mental Illness DC (202-673-6495). 

This article was updated on Jan. 3 to include additional sources and correct the spelling of “Uyghur Region.”
