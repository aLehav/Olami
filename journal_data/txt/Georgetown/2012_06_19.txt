Jay Gruber is set to replace Rocco DelMonaco as Georgetown’s chief of police July 30, according to an email sent by Vice President for Public Affairs Erik Smulson to members of the university community Tuesday.
Gruber most recently served as assistant director of public safety and assistant chief of police at the University of Maryland, where he has worked for 25 years.
According to Smulson, Gruber was integral to several areas of law enforcement at UMD and has been nationally recognized for his expertise in emergency management and communication on college campuses.
“Jay understands the unique dynamics facing university campuses, and I am confident that he will be an excellent leader for the Department of Public Safety and a contributing member of the Georgetown community,” Smulson wrote in the email.
Earlier this month, the university community received notice that DelMonaco will step down as vice president for university safety and DPS chief on June 30. Joseph Smith will serve as interim chief, withDPS reporting directly to Smulson, until Gruber takes his post.
