Two bombings at the Boston Marathon yesterday, which have left at least three dead and 100 injured, have stunned and devastated the nation and the Georgetown community.
The explosions were the result of bombs that detonated near the marathon’s finish line around five hours after the race began, and police spent the rest of the day in Boston and other major cities searching for other potential explosives.
Federal officials have deemed the incident a terrorist attack, according to multiple media outlets, and the government is taking extra security measures around the country. In Washington, D.C., the portion of Pennsylvania Avenue outside of the White House was closed off to the public as a safety precaution. Officials conducted the same procedure during the Oklahoma City bombings in 1995. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is also stationing additional officers in Metro stations during rush hour.
In a press conference last night, President Obama assured the public that the government would take action against those responsible.
“We are Americans united in concern for our fellow citizens,” President Obama said. “We still do not know who did this or why and people shouldn’t jump to conclusions. … Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups, will feel the full weight of justice.”
The District’s Emancipation Day celebration today will not be cancelled, but there will be increased security at the event, and the university is also ramping up its patrol in light of the incident.
“We are increasing our presence out in the community, and the officers have been reminded to be vigilant about anything that’s out of the ordinary,” Chief of Police and Director of Public Safety JayGruber said.
While Gruber acknowledged that an urban area such as Washington, D.C., had the potential to be attacked, he said that Georgetown did not appear to be a target.
“[The bombings don’t} seem to be a nexus to higher education or any sort of religious institution, so my level of concern isn’t as high as if the organization had been Catholic,” Gruber said.
The university held a prayer service yesterday night at Dahlgren Chapel to support the victims of the bombing.
According to the Boston Marathon’s entry list, nine people from the 20007 zip code, which encompasses Georgetown and Burleith, were registered for the race, in addition to some Georgetown students who were in Boston for the race.
Caroline Heydinger (COL ’13) ran in the marathon with her mother. She finished the race about 15 minutes before the explosion, while her mother finished four minutes prior to the blast.
“It was a tough experience,” Heydinger said. “I’m just so grateful that my family and I made it out okay.”
Heydinger said that she was waiting for her mother at their designated meeting place about two blocks away from the finish line when the bomb went off. She described the scene as chaotic, with people in a state of shock and disbelief, attempting to find family members.
“It’s just such an unbelievable, devastating thing,” Heydinger said. “I feel so fortunate personally but I feel so sad that someone would do this and sad for everyone who was directly or indirectly affected.”
Hannah Gerdes (COL ’16), a former staffer of The Hoya, was also at the marathon to watch her father run and was evacuated from Boston’s subway system when the bombings occurred.
“Initially, we heard that there were explosions, and it was very sobering,” Gerdes said. “We were disbelieving. … It was unreal that it was happening.”
Gerdes was with a friend but was separated from her mother and father at the time of the explosions.
“For me … it was more not knowing how to react and not knowing initially whether my mom was safe and my dad was safe,” Gerdes said. “It was kind of not knowing and waiting to hear from people.”
After leaving the subway and attempting to return to Harvard University where she had been staying,Gerdes received text messages from friends and families asking whether she was safe, the first indication of the incident’s gravity.
“Before this had happened, we didn’t realize the severity of it,” Gerdes said. “That was the first time we realized [that] this was national news.”
Heydinger called the situation “surreal” and praised Boston officials’ response to the attack.
“One of the most moving things was just seeing all the ambulances rushing to the scene,” Heydingersaid. “All I could think was all these people are running away and these people [are] running there.”
Heydinger, who returned to her home in Vermont following the marathon, said that she would try to return to campus today following the bombing.
“I think it had a very big impact on me but I think that Georgetown is a very loving community and there’s no place I’d rather be after something like this,” Heydinger said. “It really puts things in perspective.”

This week, students will take a break from studying to learn Greek dancing, play cricket and cook African food as part of iWeek, a celebration of international students’ cultures sponsored by the Office of International Programs, despite several funding hurdles this year.
Student groups, including the African Society of Georgetown, Students for Justice in Palestine, the Georgetown Cricket Club and Ballet Folklorico Mexicano de Georgetown, will hold events representing their interests and cultures.
OIP grants $150 to each student group that sponsors an event, and student groups must find alternative resources for supplementary funding.
“This year we had some difficulty getting funding for the organizations so that was definitely a struggle,” International Students Sector Program Assistant Katie Mangialardi (COL ’16) said.
Mangialardi also said that cultural groups participating iniWeek have encountered trouble generating adequate publicity for their events this week, as the main outlet is a single Facebook page.
“Getting the word out is always a big thing for us,” she said.
However, campus-wide emails have encouraged some students to attend iWeek events, which run from Monday to Friday. Events kicked off with a half-hour meditation Monday night sponsored by the Buddhist Meditation Sangha, which Veronica Tovia (MSB ’16) attended.
“I’m very interested in Buddhism lately and tried it recently with a yoga instructor in Mexico,” Tovia said. “I saw it in an email for iWeek and I decided to come.”
Mangialardi said that she is most excited for the language exchange partner coffee hour Tuesday, which will promote the Language Exchange Program, a service that matches individuals who wish to practice foreign languages.  She also highlighted an art show in the Intercultural Center Galleria, run by the Georgetown University Student Association senate Subcommittee on the Arts. This art show is one of the subcommittee’s first actions since its formation in November.
GUSA senator and Subcommittee on the Arts Chair Lizzy Oh (SFS ’15) said that iWeek provides an opportunity to foster appreciation for student artwork at Georgetown.
“When GUSA established the arts subcommittee in the first place, we really wanted to bring artwork to campus — because it seems to be trapped in Walsh — and make it visible through an arts display,” Oh said.
Oh also aligned the goals of the Subcommittee on the Arts with the purpose of iWeek.
“We felt like the international students should be more involved with GUSA, and this is GUSA’s way of trying to recognize how international Georgetown is. Art is existent in every person and the subcommittee wanted to help foster creative expression on campus.”
She said hopes that the art show will help emphasize the important presence that foreign students have on campus.
“Our school is known for being internationally focused, but we don’t really see that outside [of] the classroom,” Oh said. “iWeek can really bridge the gaps between those who are international and those who are not international.”

While Georgetown lacked a cultural outlet for Native American students before this semester, the newly formed Native American Student Council will hold its first major event — a powwow — on Copley Lawn April 28.
“It helps to have a club for Native American students finally,” NASC Student of Color Alliance Representative Andrew Vondall (COL ’13), a member of the Crow tribe, said. “We know Native American students come and go at Georgetown all the time, but there [was] no Native American student club.”
NASC hopes that the powwow, which will celebrate Native American culture through authentic music, student dance performances representing a variety of tribes and Native American food, will become the organization’s signature yearly event.
NASC was founded to address equality for Native American students and serve as an outlet for the celebration of Native American cultural heritage. Group leaders also hope to attract more Native American students to apply to Georgetown in the future. In 2012, 1.5 percent of students — approximately 50 students out of 3,316 — admitted to the Class of 2016 were Native American. Statistics are not available for the 2013 admissions cycle.
According to NASC Treasurer Whitney Dockrey (NHS ’15), a member of the Cherokee tribe, NASC is trying to work with the Office of Admissions to reach out to prospective Native American students.NASC also hopes to work with current students to help them find scholarships that specifically support Native Americans.
“We are trying to work with admissions, so when a Native student applies, we can call them and encourage them to come to Georgetown,” Dockrey said.
Vondall cited the importance of having such a group in place when greater numbers of Native American students come to campus.
“It’s mainly … a place for Native American students can go and share their experiences,” Vondall said. “Eventually it will come to a point where lots of Native students come here.”
But Dockrey stressed that the club is geared to serve as an outlet for those interested in Native American culture, as well as those who are part of it.
“There is a place for everyone and anything they are interested in,” Dockrey said.
Dockrey and NASC Chair Hilary Andrews (NHS ’14), a member of the Aquinnah tribe, developed plans for the organization last semester and officially founded the group when they returned to campus in January.
Whereas most cultural groups on campus are funded by the Student Activities Commission, NASC is funded by the Center for Social Justice, though it has also received some funding from the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access and the Students of Color Association.
According to Andrews, NASC’s mission to dispel misinformed student perceptions about Native American culture and history makes its affiliation with CSP a good fit.
“A lot of history gets skewed,” Andrews said. “Our approach is to eradicate some of the stereotypes and misconceptions that are associated with the Native American population.”
NASC has already established relationships with other groups in the D.C. area, including Native American student groups at The George Washington University and University of Maryland.
NASC is planning more events and activities around the city in the future, including a meeting with the Senate Committee on Native Affairs.

The District of Columbia Department of Transportation and the Georgetown Business Improvement District are examining different options to improve pedestrian safety in response to growing pedestrian and traffic volumes.
One of the most congested intersections is M Street and Wisconsin Avenue, which, according to BID Transportation Director Jonathon Kass, is “the principal intersection of Georgetown.”
“When you have two wonderful retail quarters intersecting, usually you want that to be a fantastic place for pedestrians,” Kass said. “We have very much the opposite situation there. We need to be throwing every tool we have at that to make it more pleasant, more safe.”
According to Kass, historic streetlamps with large bases reduce sidewalk width, an issue that is compounded by having multiple buses at one stop due to large numbers of customers waiting for transportation. Short time spans to cross M Street from east to west also jeopardize pedestrian safety.
Last week from April 8 to 13, BID and DDOT experimented with placing traffic control officers at the intersection of M Street and Wisconsin Avenue to assess potential solutions. If BID and DDOT determine the traffic control officers have been useful, BID will push for more traffic control resources at other key intersections, such as the Georgetown end of the Key Bridge.
In addition, Kass hopes automated enforcement options, such as red light and speed cameras, can protect pedestrians and get motorists to comply with the law.
“We want pedestrians to follow the law, but it’s a little bit crazy to tell them they have four seconds out of a minute and a half to legally cross and then have those four seconds be obstructed,” Kass said.
Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Chairman Ron Lewis, who acknowledged the need for new traffic controls in the Georgetown business district because of increasing vehicle and pedestrian density, is a proponent of speed cameras.
“Get a couple of tickets, and suddenly [drivers] are very mindful of the speed limit,” Lewis said.  “They are probably the most effective thing that DDOT could use to get the traffic calmed down and pedestrians safer.”
Despite mounting pedestrian safety concerns, BID is pleased with the increasing foot traffic in Georgetown.
“The reason we have so many pedestrians in Georgetown is because we have a lot of places where they want to go,” Kass said. “It’s a good problem to have.”
Although both Kass and Lewis see the need for new automated options, underground utility issues make the installation of additional poles for the equipment impossible. The only option that will work with the existing traffic control structure is a new type of camera that can clamp onto existing poles, which are not currently available to BID.
Washington, D.C.’s budget for the current fiscal year and Mayor Vincent Gray’s proposed budget, which goes into effect in October, both allocate money for these traffic improvement options. Funding is currently being used toward technological pilots and research into the best methods and locations for implementation.
HAWK signals, which allow pedestrians to push a button to trigger lights that stop traffic at crosswalks, are an example of one such pilot. They have been employed in various neighborhoods throughout the District and were installed last week in Cleveland Park on Connecticut Avenue NW between Ordway and Newark Streets NW.
Although they are proven to enhance safety — a study on one HAWK signal showed that 97.1 percent of motorists complied — Kass said that they represent a failure to create a culture in which pedestrians have the right of way.
With the HAWK signal, pedestrians can no longer step into the crosswalk and expect cars to stop. Instead, they must push a button and wait for a light to mandate yielding traffic.
“There is something lost in the process,” Kass said. “You are yielding some of the rights today in exchange for safety.”
BID is currently assembling a task force and working groups to examine the future of pedestrian safety as part of BID’s “Georgetown 2028” plan. BID is now working to engage key stakeholders, including property owners, residential neighbors, city agencies and others involved in the Georgetown community to pinpoint areas in need of improvement and possible solutions.
“The product of the plan will be a vision and an action agenda that we hopefully bring to all the stakeholders — residents and business owners — for a consensus about where we are going together,” Kass said.

The GUSA senate unanimously passed a resolution Sunday calling for an end to the one-keg limit for on-campus parties and for disciplinary rules and expectations for weekend nights to be applied to socializing on Georgetown Day.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said he would consider the proposal.
“It is possible,” Olson said. “I haven’t reached a decision yet, but I will be consulting with student leaders and administrators to reach a decision in the next few days.”
The bill involved collaboration between the Georgetown University Student Association Senate and executive. In the executive’s 40-day plan, released April 4, GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) prioritized on-campus social life, in part because of its close relationship to the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, promising to address it before the end of the current academic year.
“Off-campus crackdowns are going to continue to happen. The rules are going to continue to be tightened, and people are going to start feeling it,” Tisa said. “I don’t want students to be arrested, to be put on sanctions, but it’s going to happen because it’s part of the campus plan reality.
“But because of that,” Tisa added, “what we can do is make campus so much easier to socialize and host parties on. If we can make campus the zone where you don’t have to worry about a lot of those things, then students will naturally clot there.”
The keg limit currently in effect was introduced in spring 2007, after a student referendum demonstrated overwhelming opposition to the Disciplinary Review Committee’s fall 2006 suggestion of an outright keg ban. The local Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E also passed a resolution against the proposed keg ban at the time, fearing that banning kegs on campus would move students more into the Georgetown neighborhood. An earlier keg limit had allowed two kegs per on-campus party.
GUSA Senator Ben Weiss (COL ’15), a sponsor of the bill, agreed that reevaluating these restrictions would align with the goals of the campus plan.
“The way to truly change the way students behave at Georgetown is to make thecampus more receptive to social activity.  It’s a call to rethink the manner in which administrators are trying to implement the Campus Plan,” Weiss said.
The bill sponsors hope that the removal of the keg ban will complement a softened attitude toward student behavior on Georgetown Day, which will take place April 26.
GUSA senators also hope to eliminate miscommunication between the university and students regarding disciplinary policies. Since Georgetown Day is currently approached as a regular weekday, students can sometimes face harsher punishment than they would for similar actions on a Friday or Saturday night.
“There are different regulations, specifically in recognition that it’s Georgetown Day and not ‘Georgetown Evening,’ but students should have the same rights to socialize as it would be on a weekend night on Georgetown Day,” Weiss said.
According to Tisa, Department of Public Safety officers who patrol during the day are different from those who patrol at night, which often results in inconsistent rule enforcement.
“DPS officers who are patrolling during the day are not used to seeing that kind of partying going on that early, so they don’t really know how to react to it and they tend to react really across the board. Some are very lenient while some are very strict. The rules have also traditionally been very confusing. Students don’t know if they can party, if capacity limits and the noise limits are different,”Tisa said. “We’re basically asking for an exception, to apply a weekend night standard to the day.”
Tisa pointed out that eliminating the keg limit and lifting the on-campus socialization restrictions for Georgetown Day would entice students to socialize on campus, decreasing disturbance in the neighborhood next Friday.
“This will reduce the number of students going off campus in the afternoon. Neighbors who are coming home from a week at work on a Friday don’t want to be bothered by hundreds of students walking around intoxicated,” Tisa said.
This marks the second year in a row in which students have sparred with the administration over Georgetown Day regulations. Last year, students responded forcefully to the university’s announcement that it would set up barricades around Copley Lawn, resulting in the abandonment of the policy.
“Georgetown Day is a day that students all enjoy, but there have been instances in which the university has worked in contrast to what students want,” Weiss said.

Georgetown’s Relay for Life raised approximately $150,000 this year, $50,000 less than in 2012, continuing its steady decline since 2010.
This year’s figure was a far cry from the peak of $400,000 in 2010 and the lowest amount raised since the event first took place at Georgetown in 2007.
With approximately 2,000 attendees Friday, this year’s turnout also represented a slight decline over last year’s.
The all-night celebration was the culmination of year-long fundraising efforts for the American Cancer Society.
“Though numbers were not as high as they were last year, that is not a measure of our success,” Relay Co-Chair Dan Silkman (COL ’15) said. “Our success is the experience of the event and the kind of community that this event creates on campus, and so in that sense, we absolutely did succeed.”
The School of Foreign Service Diplomatic Ball coincided with Relay on Friday night, though Silkman denied that the scheduling conflict cut into turnout because the Relay committee incentivized ball attendees to attend the celebration once the ball ended.  
“I don’t necessarily think that was the reason,” Silkman said. “Our recruitment efforts were tremendous this year, but sometimes … it’s just not there. It was totally OK and we were very proud to have the number that we did.”
DJ Wise (COL ’13), co-chair of Relay in 2012, said that though there was a slight decline in attendance, those who attended were passionate and stayed later than in previous years.
“Our attendance this year was a little lower than previous years,” Wise said. “But I would say the people that were there were much more involved than some people in the past.”
Wise is also a member of the National Collegiate Advisory Team that supports the American Cancer Society’s more than 500 collegiate relays around the country.
“Right now we’re seeing just a small decline in some of our collegiate events throughout the country, just kind of as a national trend, so I do think that the slight decline in fundraising this year could be a part of the national trend,” Wise said. “But it could also be that this is a different year for Georgetown and, like I said, we have to approach each year differently.”
While only $130,000 had been raised by the eve of the event, organizers were optimistic that this year’s totals could eclipse last year’s because a large proportion of funds are traditionally raised in the final days leading up to the event.
Wise said that the turnover of graduating classes and incoming freshman classes could have impacted the fundraising efforts. Silkman said that every year Relay sees some resistance from students.
“There has been sort of … a trend, we’ve been told, in terms of collegiate Relays having a little bit of a dip,” Silkman said. “Georgetown Relay five years ago raised over $400,000 in a year, so obviously we raised $150,000 and that is significantly lower, and we don’t necessarily know why that is.”
Some have speculated that support for Relay suffers from public disapproval with the American Cancer Society, which has faced criticism for its substantial overhead.
Relay is working on re-envisioning current initiatives and on establishing new ones to counter the decline in fundraising. They are also considering options to change the time and location of the event.
However, according to Silkman, the decline in numbers is not significant for Relay because they do not compare numbers with previous years. He said that, overall, the event was an overwhelming success.
“The way we look at it, as kind of a leadership team, is not necessarily that our numbers were lower than last year, but that at the beginning of this year, we started at zero and that we raised $150,000 to transform the lives of people affected by cancer, so that’s kind of how we view the amount of money that we raise every year,” he said.
All of the money Relay raises goes back to the American Cancer Society. According to Silkman, the American Cancer Society gives a few hundred thousand dollars, more than Georgetown Relay raises, to the Lombardi Cancer Center at Georgetown for research every year.

Dahlgren Chapel was vandalized sometime between Saturday night and Sunday morning, with chairs, an organ mirror and panel and a crucifix among the items damaged.
Although Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh confirmed that the university has taken measures to tighten security around the chapel since the incident, neither she nor Chief of Police and Director of Public Safety Jay Gruberwould provide additional details on the ongoing investigation, such as whether there were operational security cameras in the chapel during the incident or if there are any leads on suspects.
According to Pugh, the incident was reported around 10 a.m. Sunday morning to the Department of Public Safety, leaving little time before the start of 11 a.m. Mass. The 11 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. services were relocated to St. William’s Chapel in Copley Hall. Mass resumed in Dahlgren at 5 p.m. after the damage was cleared.
Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., stated that although the crucifix is a religious symbol, the object — which had a hand broken off — appeared to have been knocked over as the suspect tried to approach the piano and organ located behind the altar, meaning there is no concrete evidence that the vandalism was inspired by anti-religious sentiments.
“If the person had intended to desecrate the crucifix, I presume that a more dramatic and clear gesture damaging the crucifix would have been done,” O’Brien wrote in an email. “So while damage was done to the crucifix, which we condemn along with the damage to the other property in the chapel, we cannot say now that the purpose of the damage was specifically desecration.”
While a complete inventory of the chapel’s property had not yet been taken as of press time, O’Brien stated that he did not expect any other damage to be discovered and that nothing had been found stolen.
Churchgoers were stunned to learn of the incident.
“I was shocked,” Sally Kiefer, a regular attendee of the 12:30 p.m. Mass, said. “I’ve been coming here since 1973, and nothing like this has ever happened.”
University President John J. DeGioia sent an email to the Georgetown community at approximately 2:20 p.m. Sunday reflecting similar disappointment.
“I must underscore that acts of vandalism, especially of sacred places, have no place in our campus community,” DeGioia wrote. “As a Catholic and Jesuit university, we are committed to fostering a community that is welcoming to people of all religions, races and ethnicities and that values understanding, inclusion and respect.”
O’Brien added that while he is upset by the incident, the support of Georgetown community members has lessened the blow.
“I am deeply saddened by this destructive action in the spiritual heart of our campus,” O’Brien wrote.“Dahlgren Chapel means a great deal not just to Catholics on campus but to many others who find inDahlgren a reminder of our vital religious heritage. I am consoled by the outreach from diverse members of our community.”
Georgetown University Student Association President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ‘14) released a statement late Sunday afternoon condemning acts of vandalism.
In May 2012, the upperclassmen of the women’s club volleyball team admitted to littering the steps of the chapel with condom wrappers and cups of alcohol.
DeGioia urged anyone with information about the incident to contact the Department of Public Safety.

As part of its effort to expand collaborative research opportunities, the Georgetown University Medical Center’s Lombardi Cancer Center announced a joint partnership with the John Theurer Cancer Center at the Hackensack University Medical Center last week.
The two institutions have been affiliated since the signing of an agreement between the Hackensack, N.J. physicians’ group and the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital — which is not owned by Georgetown but is GUMC’s clinical partner — earlier this year.
Lombardi Cancer Center director Louis Weiner wrote in an email that the expansion of the partnership would benefit doctors, researchers and students.
“We anticipate a great deal of expanded opportunities for research collaborations to result from this affiliation as well as expanded educational opportunities for senior-level trainees or students of all levels who wish to gain experience in the area of leukemia, lymphomas and other blood cancers,” Weiner wrote.
One of the most anticipated results of the agreement between the two institutions is the further development of a stem cell transplant program for patients suffering from blood and bone marrow cancers, according to Weiner. He expects the program will provide a significant financial boost to the Lombardi Center in the form of greater clinical revenue streams and more funding from grants and philanthropy.
Cancer patients from the D.C. area will benefit from the increased variety and quality of cancer treatment options made possible by the partnership.
“This affiliation with Hackensack UMC is terrific for our community. As the only comprehensive cancer center in the region, one of our primary responsibilities is to fully serve the cancer needs of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area,” Weiner wrote. “By offering the only academic blood and marrow stem cell transplantation program in this area, we can offer the highest quality options for patients with leukemia, lymphomas or other cancers of the blood.”
Executive Vice President for Health Services and Executive Dean of the School of Medicine Howard Federoff, who will oversee the project, noted that collaboration with Hackensack positions the university to weather impending changes to the health care system.
“I’m very excited to lead GUMC into a partnership such as this. In an era of great changes in health care, the ability for health care organizations to partner and innovate will be key to their success and growth,” he wrote. “This cancer center affiliation between Georgetown and Hackensack [encourages] collaborations to accelerate discovery, with broad capabilities to then disseminate new findings and put them into clinical practice.”
Federoff added that GUMC is in talks with other medical research facilities across the country and hopes to expand the breadth of its collaborative research opportunities in the near future.

After two years in disarray, the Georgetown University Garden Initiative has been brought back to life.
Founded in 2008 with a ReImagine Georgetown grant, GUGI’s community garden, located behind Kehoe Field near the Georgetown University School of Medicine, was abandoned by fall 2011. Gabriel Pincus (SFS ’14) and Whitney Pratt (COL ’14) have revived GUGI, attempting to raise awareness of the benefits of locally grown food and to teach gardening techniques.
Over the past two years, Pincus and Pratt have built relationships with administrators, grounds staff and professors to create the infrastructure necessary to re-establish the garden.
“This is a student group. It’s very much about learning,” Pincus said. “Working with faculty in the biology department or on the medical campus and with grounds-keeping —they know their stuff, this is their job. So, working with them and learning from them could be really beneficial for us as students.”
According to Pincus, the community garden’s major challenges were obtaining supplies, coordinating with medical campus staff to keep the space accessible, establishing a consistent water source and building the garden beds.
Pincus and Pratt have turned to creative techniques, such as turning old tires into garden beds to expand the space and coordinating with the university landscaping crew for access to a water tank for a recent seed-planting event.
In addition to relying on university sources for infrastructural support, the community garden group has also maintained informal relationships with other student groups on campus, such as MagisRow Meditation House’s composting initiative, with which GUGI built two large bins for compostable material for Magis Row houses.
To promote awareness, GUGI has held multiple seed-planting events this spring, and it plans to hold a dinner at the end of the semester, incorporating fresh produce from the garden.
Pratt is confident that the community garden will be sustainable through increased student involvement.
“Georgetown and D.C. in general are making a sustainable push, and so the garden is really relevant right now,” Pratt said. “The community garden makes it obvious that growing food is easy — it tastes better, is less expensive and is really fun. It’s like childhood — playing in the dirt.”
The community garden HoyaLink page now has 35 members, while its official Facebook page has 19 likes.
Pincus stressed the importance of increasing visibility on campus in order to generate student interest, especially due to the inconvenience of the garden’s location. By the medical hospital, the garden is far from the campus center and from overall student activity.
Pratt hopes to move the garden to a more prominent campus location, such as next to O’DonovanHall. According to Pratt, the community garden group must first show the university administration that it can consistently maintain the current space.
With a more established space and consistent student interest, Pincus said that the community garden will begin seeking more formal collaborations with other student groups and faculty members. The group is considering working with Georgetown EcoAction, helping faculty members maintain gardens around campus, selling food at the Georgetown University Farmers’ Market and working with the new Greenhouse Living and Learning Community.
In addition, Pratt said she has envisioned a way to give individuals their own plots, further increasing student investment and involvement in the project.
“Here we are in a city, and going to Leo’s epitomizes lack of consciousness about eating food,”Pincus said. “You don’t even know how the food is cooked at Leo’s, let alone where it was produced or how it was produced.”

For the third consecutive semester, student leaders discussed possible improvements to HoyaLink at the Student Group Union semi-annual summit Sunday.
SGU aims to provide a network for student groups to discuss common issues through events such as these summits.
For most of the summit, approximately 20 campus leaders brainstormed ways to enhance the university-sponsored online platform, which elicits frustration for some.
Student leaders discussed adding functions to HoyaLink, including online financing, rich text formatting and scheduling capability through Doodle, an online scheduling tool.
International Relations Club Chair Jeff Caso (SFS ’15) expressed concern about over-reliance on the university-sponsored web platform.
“I don’t think we should migrate every club function over there. It marginalizes non-recognized student groups,” Caso said. “It could potentially lead to disaster if there were to be a mainframe failure.”
SGU Executive Committee Chair Aman Shahi (COL ’13) agreed and said that the effectiveness of some HoyaLink features leaves something to be desired for a tech-savvy generation of students.
“The administration sometimes will be very excited about something that they’re providing in terms of resources for student groups, and it’s great that they’re trying to do that, but a lot of times the fact that they’re coming from a different generation is clear,” Shahi said.
Though HoyaLink dominated the discussion, student group financing was also a prominent topic, with leaders agreeing that clubs need easier access to their financial statements. Most agreed that financial statements should be updated in real-time for groups to view online, a feature that could possibly be integrated into HoyaLink.
Caso said that he hopes SGU will focus more on student group finances in the future.
“My primary issue that I’d like to see the SGU focus on is how to make financing easier, and I think that is not necessarily a HoyaLink answer,” Caso said. “I think HoyaLink can be considered as a possible … solution, but I personally am not entirely in favor of switching everything over to HoyaLink.”
Japan Network Students of Color Alliance representative Weston Takata (SFS ’15) said he appreciated the opportunity to brainstorm and problem-solve with different organizations.
“I think we hit on most of the important points, about the user-friendliness, the ability of the clubs to possibly customize their pages and maybe cut down on some of the excess material that’s onHoyaLink,” Takata said. “It’s always nice to try and collaborate with other groups not necessarily related to you.”
IRC Secretary General Jennifer Zink (SFS ’15) agreed and said that it was helpful to collaborate on ways to improve HoyaLink.
“I thought it was really helpful,” Zink said. “It was really cool to get the perspectives of leaders from other student groups because we tend to all have the same issues with HoyaLink and have a similar vision for how we see it going forward.”
Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), College Democrats president and SGU executive committee political representative Sunday’s summit was more productive than SGU’s December meeting.
“I liked how this one was more focused, and I thought we were able to get a lot more substantive ideas on the table,” Tezel said. “I think that comes with each new summit — the organization, which is relatively new, gains a greater focus.”
