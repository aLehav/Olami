Michael Eric Dyson, professor of sociology at Georgetown, engaged in a heated debate about police brutality and race relations with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani on the Sunday-morning talk show “Meet the Press.”
In the segment, Giuliani criticized the protests sparked by the August shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Mo., wondering why the same focus was not applied to black-on-black crime. He cited that 93 percent of black victims are killed by other blacks. Dyson responded by calling Giuliani’s version of events a “false equivalency.”
“Black people who kill black people go to jail,” Dyson said on the show. “White people who are policemen who kill black people do not go to jail.”
The discussion also focused on disproportionately white police forces present in multi-racial communities. Giuliani, who initiated the stop-and-frisk practice by New York police officers as mayor, argued that black communities should cut down on crime to reduce the number of police officers in their areas, prompting a final response from the professor as the segment ended.
“This is a defensive mechanism of white supremacy at work in your mind, sir,” Dyson said.
The debate comes in light of the imminent Ferguson grand jury decision, which will be announced later today, on whether to indict Wilson for shooting Brown.
Mariah Driver (COL ’17), who is currently a student in Dyson’s sociology class, Sociology of Hip-Hop: Urban Theodicy of Jay-Z, said that the professor discussed the segment during his lecture this morning.
“He talked a bit about the hypocrisy of citing the statistics of high percentages of black-on-black murders when 83 percent of white murders are committed by other white people … so the justification for white policing of African-Americans cannot be justified by high percentages of within-race killings,” Driver said.
She also expressed her shock at Giuliani’s comments.
“It was appalling, to say the least, to hear such a respected and powerful figure as Giuliani express the same ideals that are plaguing our society today,” Driver said. “Watching such a provocative debate and being able to walk into class the following morning to discuss it with the person involved was a unique experience.”
Dyson could not be reached for comment.

Apparently Dyson wasn’t ready to debate with facts.

The north end of campus lost power for six hours on Saturday due to a transformer failure in Harbin Hall. The failure triggered electrical system safety mechanisms, which caused a power outage in surrounding buildings, according to Vice President of Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey.
The transformers failed in Harbin at around 12:30 p.m., which caused power outages in Harbin, Gervase Building, Ryan and Mulledy Halls, New North, Dahlgren Chapel, half of Reiss Science Building, Davis Performing Arts Center and the Intercultural Center.
Planning and Facilities Management staff restored power by 6:30 p.m. to Gervase, Ryan and Mulledy, New North, Reiss, ICC and Dahlgren Chapel, according to Morey. Power in Harbin Hall and the PAC was not restored until past midnight on Sunday.
“As our team performed troubleshooting they were able to bring the other buildings back on line,” Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Harbin is currently on temporary power until we procure and install a new building transformer.”
Although buildings lost power, all life-safety systems such as fire alarms, emergency lighting and sprinklers remained functional.
Harbin resident Julia Langan (SFS ’18) said that the lights returned in Harbin in the middle of the night, waking up many students.
“I know it was interesting for some people because the power came back on in the middle of night,” Langan said. “And so people whose lights had been flipped on when the power went out, at three in the morning or whenever the power came back on, everyone’s lights went on and woke everyone up.”
Harbin resident Celia Calano (COL ’18) said that although the Office of Facilities Management emailed students three times with updates, it failed to provide students with a reason for the outage.
 “I think that the school did a good job updating us to the best of their ability, but I think that we would have appreciated knowing what the problem was,” Calano said. “I don’t even know if the school knew what was going on, but there was a problem with one of the devices. But we weren’t told what it was. So it would have been nice to know what was wrong.”

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, a former Georgetown professor, announced his resignation at a press conference at the White House Monday morning.
“It’s been the greatest privilege of my life — the greatest privilege of my life to lead, and most important, to serve — to serve with the men and women of the Defense Department and support their families. I am immensely proud of what we’ve accomplished during this time,” Hagel said in prepared remarks at the press conference.
Neither President Barack Obama, who introduced Hagel’s resignation and thanked him for his time in office, nor Hagel offered a specific reason for the secretary’s departure.
“Last month, Chuck came to me to discuss the final quarter of my presidency and determined that having guided the department through this transition, it was an appropriate time for him to complete his service,” Obama said.
According to The Washington Post, rumors had been circulating about Hagel’s impending departure for a month. The secretary, who faced a difficult confirmation process in 2013, was chosen primarily to advance the White House’s focus on limiting defense spending and pivoting from the Middle East to East Asia. However, the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and the consequential authorization of airstrikes by the president have complicated these efforts.
Hagel noted that he will continue to serve as secretary until the Senate confirms his successor. His resignation comes two months after that of Attorney General Eric Holder in September. Obama nominated Loretta Lynch as Holder’s successor, pending congressional confirmation.
After serving as a Nebraska senator for two terms from 1996 to 2008, Hagel joined the faculty of the School of Foreign Service in February 2009. He taught an undergraduate seminar entitled 21st Century Geopolitical Realities in the spring and a graduate seminar entitled Redefining Geopolitical Relationships in the fall.
Hagel did not announce his future plans after leaving office.
