Still struggling to get many of the recommendations it issued in a 2009 report implemented by the university, the Student Commission for Unity is seeking to revitalize its presence on campus.
“Our fight is to make sure that the ideas, recommendations and documents from a few years ago do not go [uforgotten],” SCU President Ryan Wilson (COL ’12) said.
The seven-member commission aims to address the status of underrepresented racial groups on campus and in the admissions process, as well as the role of diversity among faculty members. It also advocates for the further development of academic programs such as women’s and gender studies and the possible creation of programs for Asian-American and Latino-American studies.
According to Wilson, the university administration needs to focus on diversity in its academics and treatment of faculty. He particularly suggested giving tenure to more minority professors and making diversity issues a bigger topic of conversation with prospective students.
“We have brought up diversity issues to Hoya Saxa Weekend, Blue & Gray Tour Guides and [the Georgetown Admissions Ambassadors Program] in order … to project the university’s mission to prospective students,” he said.
Brian Kesten (COL ’10) and Brian Cook (COL ’10) founded the SCU in April 2009 in the interest of researching the extent to which Georgetown was living up to its Jesuit mission through diversity initiatives. The students were responding to two alleged hate crimes against Georgetown students as well as what they believed to be The Hoya’s minimal coverage of a rally and vigil for the Jena Six, six black students from Louisiana who were tried for attempted murder in a case widely cited as an example of racial injustice.
The commission was originally a part of the Georgetown University Student Association because several of its founding members were also members of GUSA. While this initially eased the process of funding allocation, according to current SCU member and former GUSA Senator Stephanie Frenel (SFS ’12), the SCU and GUSA grew apart because the student government did little to help implement the SCU survey recommendations.
In spring 2009, the SCU officially split from GUSA.
During the 2008-2009 academic year, the SCU surveyed 1,339 Georgetown students about their perceptions of bias and diversity on campus. It released these findings and resulting recommendations to the university in January 2009.
Most recently, the SCU was largely responsible for helping develop the Main Campus Initiative on Diversity and Inclusiveness, a series of working groups created in April 2009 to address diversity issues within admissions and recruitment, student life and academics at Georgetown. According to Frenel, the SCU has also contributed to the establishment of A Different Dialogue, a program focused on encouraging diversity through conversation, and The Doyle Initiative, an effort to include diversity in academic settings.
Wilson said that the SCU’s current work has been stalled because of a lack of response from the administration to the recommendations of the commission’s 2009 report.
Although the Diversity Initiative led to the hiring of more minority faculty and strengthened the diversity of the undergraduate applicant pool, Wilson felt that very few of the Admissions and the Recruitment Working Groups’ recommendations concerning the culture surrounding diversity in academics and admissions have been addressed.
These suggestions included the addition of an additional box on the admission applications that includes forms of gender expression outside of male and female and the provision of funding for students to attend multicultural college fairs and recruitment events as well as the National Campus Pride College Fairs. The report also advocated for providing a means of communication between the appropriate accepted students and current faculty, staff and undergraduates who work with underrepresented religious groups and services that address student disabilities.
“We have several diversity working groups on campus. What the SCU wants to do is implement the great work that has been produced,” Wilson said.

Several D.C. council members were subpoenaed last week as part of a U.S. Attorney’s Office investigation into campaign contributions by prominent D.C. businessman Jeffrey Thompson.
Thompson, who has long been among the top political fundraisers in the District, has come under scrutiny for possibly circumventing campaign finance laws through “straw donations,” or giving money to a third party who then submits the donation under his own name.
Thompson’s home and offices were searched by federal agents last month as part of the investigation. At the time, Ralph B. Bazilio, the chief operating officer of Thompson’s firm, Thompson, Cobb, Bazilio & Associates, told The Washington Post that there had been no accusation of wrongdoing. He added that the firm had turned over all relevant documents to the attorney’s office.
Last week, council members Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Phil Mendelson (D-At-large) and Yvette M. Alexander (D-Ward 7) each confirmed their campaign treasurers have received subpoenas and are cooperating fully with the investigation.
Mendelson, who most recently confirmed having received a subpoena, issued a statement listing the contributions he had received from Thompson during his 2010 campaign.
“I regret that this has created yet another controversy around city hall. I believe disclosure is the best course. I am hopeful that the U.S. Attorney’s investigation will uncover the facts as quickly as possible,” he said in the statement.
Wesley Williams, spokesperson of the D.C. Office of Campaign Finance, said that his office did not have any additional information and had not been subpoenaed.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office also declined to comment because the investigation is ongoing.

The Visions for a Sustainable Georgetown Initiative has recognized that it is not easy being green on the Hilltop, but hopes to change that with a campus-wide sustainability action plan.
A report presented by the group at last week’s Hoya Roundtable consists of a series of recommendations intended to increase sustainability efforts on campus.
The core suggestions include developing a Climate Action Plan and creating an official Office of Sustainability, both of which Georgetown currently lacks.
“Moving forward, we want to focus on our two core recommendations, and we want students to actively participate in bringing both to fruition,” Gabriel Pincus (SFS ’14), a member of the team that wrote the study, wrote in an email.
The authors hope that the Climate Action Plan will gain traction with the administration, which is formulating an outline for the implementation of the recommendations.
“Our hope is that [the plan] will be written by a team of administrators and sustainability experts, and incorporate the student perspective expressed at the Visions for a Sustainable Georgetown Workshop,” the report said.
The study has been in the works since November, when Georgetown University Student Association Secretary of Sustainability Jesse Robbins (SFS ’12) and former Eco-Action president Claire Austin (SFS ’12) spearheaded a workshop to gather student input on campus sustainability issues.
Prior to the development of the Visions initiative, the absence of a unified effort to improve campus sustainability hindered student efforts to effectively collaborate with administrators according to Robbins. While Visions for a Sustainable Georgetown is guided primarily by student input, the initiative has also enlisted the help of both faculty and staff.
“It’s very fragmented, the green community on campus,” Robbins said. “We thought it’d be a great idea to bring everyone together in more of a long-term manner. That became Visions for a Sustainable Georgetown.”
Overall, the report is not a strict set of directives for administrators. Rather, it is intended to be a collection of student recommendations for creating a sustainable campus. Other goals include installing water bottle refill stations in residence and streamlineing recycling in dorms and academic buildings.
Although the implementation of the recommendations will require significant cooperation from university administration, University President John J. DeGioia’s recent signature of D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray’s College and University Sustainability Pledge has left students optimistic about their recommendations.
“This report is, and I hope it will continue to be, a sort of a static way for [administrators] to look at what students think. Now it’s` all here in one report for administrators to consult any time they’re wondering what students feel should be priorities on campus,” Robbins said.

For members of the admissions review committees, the last few weeks of March are among the busiest of the year. And with a record 20,050 applications received this year, committee members have more work on their hands than ever before.
Admissions committees are responsible for reading and reviewing a percentage of undergraduate applications.
“Only the most compelling students get sent to committee,” Robert O’Rourke, assistant director of undergraduate admissions said.
Each of these committees includes a senior member from the admissions office, a school dean, a school faculty member and a current student in that school. Marilyn McMorrow, a professor in the School of Foreign Service, has been a part of the SFS admissions committee for about five years.
“I absolutely love it,” she said. “It is one of the most worthwhile things I do as a faculty member. It is a very labor-intensive process, but I believe it is a very important way to contribute to the school.”
With a strict April 1 deadline for the distribution of decision letters, members of the admissions committee work many hours on the applications, occasionally working on weekends to ensure they stay on schedule. The admissions office hopes to mail out their decisions by March 28 or 29 in order to make the traditional April 1 deadline, which falls on a Sunday this year. Although letters are not mailed out until the end of March, the committee sets an internal deadline for final decisions weeks ahead of that.
Melissa Costanzi, senior associate director of undergraduate admissions and a member of the admissions committee for Georgetown College, said that there is an enormous amount of work involved in reviewing the applications.
“It takes us a long time to make our decisions, but we want to make sure we make the right ones,” she said.
McMorrow said that she spends about 20 minutes on each application.
“I go over each student’s file very carefully because I know that student worked for a long time putting it together and I want to be fair to the students who happen to be towards the bottom of my pile of applications,” she said.
Assistant Director of Admissions Colleen Miltenberg added that admissions officers become especially dependent on one another during the final month before decisions are sent out.
“While it becomes intense, it is also very much a collaborative environment — we couldn’t get it done without each other,” she said. “Each person’s role is critical.”
Currently, the admissions committee is transitioning into the final stages of the review process, which involves looking at the students marked for extra consideration, such as legacies, students of employees and faculty, athletic recruits and first-generation college students.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon wrote in an email that while the office has already made most application decisions, their job is far from complete.
“The work of selecting the class is nearly done, and we are well underway preparing for the aftermath, which will lead to the month of April, which is a very busy time trying to essentially ‘yield’ the students we have now accepted,” he wrote.

As Women’s History Month draws to a close, the Women’s Center, GU Women of Color and GU Women in Politics will sponsor events to recognize women who have played a significant role in university history.
“Celebrating Women’s History Month is a global event and we want to be part of that celebration,” Laura Kovach, director of the Women’s Center, wrote in an email. “It’s important for us to honor the women that have been a part of the Georgetown community and engage with our current students on issues that impact women every day of their lives.”

The events in the last days of March will include notable speakers, discussions and a celebration inDarnall Hall.
Telling Her Story: Intersections of Identity and Community, an event featuring women’s personal testimonies, has existed as a part of the university’s Women’s History Month for many years. This year, the program will focus on stories of minority undergraduate students who identify as part of Georgetown’s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or questioning community.
“We wanted to give LGBTQ women of color a chance to share their experiences about life at Georgetown and how identity and community intersect,” Kovach wrote.
The Women’s Center also partnered with Campus Ministry and the White House Interfaith and Community Service Challenge to collect clothes and toiletries for the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner program. The program provides new clothing and toiletries to rape victims who must give their clothing to medical personnel when a rape kit is collected.
“This is an important issue and a great way to work with the community to help rape survivors,”Kovach wrote.
Georgetown’s celebration of Women’s History Month extends to the Women’s Center at the School of Foreign Service in Qatar, which opened in 2010. English professor Patricia O’Connor will lead Shared Women’s Histories, a discussion between the two campuses centered on gender identity and other women’s issues.
Darnall Hall Day, the last scheduled event in honor of Women’s History Month, will take place on March 28. The day celebrates the life of Eleanor Darnall, the mother of Georgetown founder John Carroll and an advocate for women’s admission to the university.
From March 19 to 23, GU Women in Politics will hold alumni networking events, speakers and a pancake dinner. GU Women of Color will also sponsor discussions throughout the week.
“Women’s History Month is an opportunity to pay our respects to the women that played a key role in the development of our nation and women’s rights,” Ana Rodriguez (SFS ’15) said. “It’s important because it reminds us of the progress that has been made and the progress that is yet to be made.”
