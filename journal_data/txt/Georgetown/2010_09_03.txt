The passage of the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act, which mandates universities to provide a list of texts corresponding to every course in the registration catalog, has left the university in flux as it seeks to comply with new textbook regulations.
Of Georgetown’s 2,119 undergraduate and graduate courses in the online catalog, approximately 52.4 percent (1,111) have textbooks listed. Around 15.7 percent (333) have books listed as “to be discussed”, meaning their titles are not available to students. Around 29 percent of courses (615) – mainly research, thesis or medical school courses – cannot be found on the website. About 2.8 percent of courses (60) don’t need textbooks.
According to Director of Media Relations Andy Pino, Georgetown has worked with Follett, which operates the university bookstore in the Leavey Center, to inform students of the required and recommended texts for classes. He said the textbook details are updated as the bookstore receives information from faculty members.
University Registrar John Pierce also said that the posting of textbook information is dependent on the cooperation of the faculty.
“As faculty members either order books through the bookstore or provide information on required or recommended material, they’re posted to that website,” he said.
As a result, not all courses in the Fall 2010 catalog included information about text prices at the time of pre-registration, and text prices continue to be missing while students finalize their schedules through the add-drop period.
Passed by Congress in 2008, the HEOA is a higher-education reform bill that imposed regulations to increase affordability of college textbooks. The act, which went into effect this year on July 1, stipulates that colleges provide a list of required and recommended textbooks for each course in the catalog students use during registration, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Every textbook listed must include the International Standard Book Number or other identifying information, as well as the retail price.
“Under the textbook disclosure provision of the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA), universities are required, to the maximum extent practical, to provide students with information about the required texts and materials that will be used in courses,” said Pino.
These provisions were enacted by Congress to help alleviate the financial burden of college students. According to The New York Times, college textbook prices rose an average of about 6 percent – twice the rate of inflation – from 1986 to 2004. Georgetown’s estimated cost of attendance allots $500 per semester to purchase textbooks, totaling $1,000 per year in addition to tuition, room, board and additional fees.
“The responsibility of the registrar’s office was to see to it that the information provided by the faculty is made available to the schedule of classes, and that we have done, because there is a link with each course that takes you to the textbook site,” said Pierce.
Pierce asked that students check class syllabuses online as well as the textbook site for reading lists.
“This is the first semester in which this new system is being used,” Pino said. “As with any new system, we will make adjustments as necessary.”
Although the requirements outlined by the HEOA are aimed to ensure students are aware of the costs associated with a particular course, giving them additional time to search for the cheapest books, as well as consider rental or e-books, some professors at Georgetown seek to alleviate costs in other ways.
Government professor Patrick Deneen assigns only original texts, not textbooks. “In choosing such texts, I strive to assign affordable books, but ones that are well produced and can last,” Deneen said. “I encourage students to buy new copies and to keep them, rather than selling them back.”
The act calls for a new Government Accounting Organization report by July 2013 to examine the impact of the textbook provisions to the Higher Education Opportunity Act.

There is no doubt that the Jesuits on campus play a central role in the Georgetown community, but what may be less apparent is the role the university plays in their lives, including their health care.
Georgetown does not directly pay health and insurance bills for Jesuits working for the university, according to Fr. John Langan, S.J.
“Members of the Jesuit Community are either covered by the health care plans offered by their home Province or by the health care plans available to university employees,” said Director of Media Relations Andy Pino.
“Jesuits, like a lot of religious groups, are an aging population,” Rev.. Eugene Nolan, S.J., said. Consequently, Jesuits may run into various health complications like those of Fr. James Schall, S.J., who is currently on medical leave this semester as he undergoes radiation treatment for a cancerous jaw.
The Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus, which oversees several local Jesuit communities including those on high school and college campuses, financially supports Jesuit medical expenses in D.C. and Maryland. Such provinces exist internationally as part of the Catholic Church’s Society of Jesus.
Jesuits employed by Georgetown receive health care benefits and insurance as any other Georgetown faculty member would. Nolan says that most Jesuits’ medical expenses are, in fact, covered by Medicare.
Nolan says, “We’ve invested over a number of years for caring for our men both in local communities like Georgetown and in all other Jesuit universities.”
Wolfington Hall, the university’s Jesuit Residence, comes with its own assisted living unit that is also funded by the Maryland province. The unit is run by nurses’ assistants and a house doctor 24 hours a day. It currently houses five of the 60 Jesuits who live on campus.
“If someone is no longer employed, as long as they’re able to genuinely take care of themselves, we prefer that they stay in the community,” said Nolan.

The Office of International Programs moved a few blocks to the Car Barn this summer, expanding the office space available to students eager to consult with the department’s staff on study abroad options.
On June 10, OIP relocated to the second floor of the Car Barn, three floors below the Main Entrance on Prospect Street. The new offices of OIP now occupy about half the floor, which also contains several classrooms and a student common area. In addition to its function as a facilitator for study abroad, OIP also serves international students on campus and fosters partnerships with institutions overseas.
OIP Executive Director Katherine Bellows noted that the Car Barn is technically farther away from the center of campus than its previous office space in Poulton Hall.
“Although we are further from Red Square and Leavey now, we are only three blocks south and for most campuses, that is not a significant distance,” she said in an email.
Some students said they found the new location more convenient.
“The old office was harder to find,” Maria Son (COL ’12), a student who visited OIP in both its old and new facilities said. “The new location is much easier to access.”
Bellows praised the space for permitting OIP more flexibility.
“The new location also gives us more functional space, of which we are definitely taking advantage!” Bellows wrote in an email.
“It’s a much bigger space,” said Radha Ramjeawan (MSB ’12), an employee of OIP. “In Poulton we only had two rooms for events, and we couldn’t fit as many people. Now, there’s more space, and more rooms for workshops to showcase OIP programs.”
The new facility has a large waiting room, with couches and seats for students waiting to meet with an OIP faculty member, as many do in preparation for future study abroad programs. Before accessing the multiple hallways and corridors, visitors arrive at the front desk, where the receptionist uses Skype to communicate to employees within the office.
Bellows suggested the move was part of a larger shuffling on campus of office space. “Our move is only one part of a larger university shift that originated with the opening of the Hariri Building,” she wrote in an email.
OIP was originally located on the second floor of Poulton Hall, near the intersection of 37th and P Streets. A sign to the building still directs passersby to the old OIP offices, which remain vacant.

Housing in Georgetown is expensive: Current rates start at $175,000 for a studio apartment in Foxhall and reach $20 million for a mansion on Prospect Street. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it is selling well.
“The market is decent,” said Darrell Parsons, the managing broker of the Georgetown office of the real estate firm Long & Foster. “It’s not recovered yet, and it probably won’t for a couple of years at least.”
Parsons cites the recession as being a key cause in lower sales.
“There’s a lot of fear and anxiety about jobs. … The difficulty to get mortgage money is another thing,” Parsons said. “People are waiting for prices to hit bottom. The problem is that no one know when the bottom is until it passes.”
ark Wellborn, the editor of UrbanTurf, a blog about D.C. real estate, had a similar assessment. “Home sales will probably remain slower than they normally are, picking back up in late fall. A lot of it depends on how the economy is doing.”
Trends in the Georgetown real estate market are mixed. According to Wellborn, the number of homes sold this July was 25 percent lower than that of July 2009, but houses sold more quickly and for an average of 15 percent more.
The 25 percent drop in house sales in Georgetown was higher than an 18 percent drop citywide, but Wellborn said that this is not unusual, given Georgetown’s concentration of expensive homes.
“Getting a loan for a million-dollar home is harder than getting a loan for a $400,000 condo,” Wellborn said.
The recent economic crisis has taken its toll on the real estate industry as well as potential buyers. Long & Foster’s Georgetown office, which handles business throughout the Washington metro area, saw its monthly sales drop from $50 million before the crisis to $30 million today. As business dried up, one-fifth of the agents quit.
Despite this, Parsons said the company is still hopeful.
“Those who are still in the business are positive . and they understand that real estate goes through cycles. … They know that there’ll be a time when the market will improve.”
The Georgetown market has been particularly slow in the past few weeks, with only about three sales a week, but Parsons said he is not concerned.
“That’s not unusual for Georgetown because people tend to be away in August.”
Interest rates are still low, which Parsons said should encourage buyers not to wait.
“If interest rates start to go up, even if prices don’t, it’ll cost more to buy a house than if one had at a lower interest rate.”
All this uncertainty among homebuyers has had little impact on Georgetown students. Most landlords in the neighborhoods surrounding the university say that their rents have not changed through the recession.
“Prices have stayed the same for the last three or four years,” said Richard Huber, who manages several properties near campus.
“I rent out at about $950 [per month] per student. . The demand is definitely there.”
Cyrus Ariaban, another local landlord, agreed.
“The market is obviously volatile in the recession, but in Georgetown . prices have stayed the same.”

Georgetown students’ popular late night eatery, Philly Pizza & Grill, may be making a comeback in a different form.
Over the summer, Philly Pizza’s owner Mehmet Kocak filed an application for a new certificate of occupancy with the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs.
The application is a request for a prepared food and sandwich shop at the now-shuttered, student-favorite Potomac Avenue location. It may also include more controversial requests such as a high-temperature pizza oven, however, according to the Georgetown Dish.
According to Marty Sullivan, the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E’s attorney, Kocak and his lawyer presented their case requesting permission to occupy the Potomac Street location at a meeting in June.
“The [fact that there was a] meeting was extraordinary,” Sullivan said. “Normally the DCRA just decides these matters without holding a meeting devoted to them.”
Also in attendance at the meeting were the director of the DCRA, the zoning administrator, representatives from the mayor’s office, and ANC2E Vice Chairman Bill Starrels.
Neither Sullivan nor Starrels know of any plans to move the application toward a vote in the near future.
“It’s out there in limbo,” Sullivan said.
Philly Pizza and its owner first came under fire last October when their certificate of occupancy was revoked for zoning code violations. The restaurant, deemed a fast food establishment by the DCRA, was not permitted to remain open on Potomac Avenue, which is zoned as a residential street. Only sit-down restaurants can be situated on residential streets.
Hearings lasting throughout the fall and winter finally culminated in a decision in March, when the Board of Zoning Adjustment decided to close Philly Pizza for good. The restaurant had remained open without its occupancy certificate during the months of the hearings, but closed its doors for the last time in early March, following a court order from the D.C. Superior Court.
News that Kocak has requested the same Potomac Street location were met with criticism from Starrels, who is opposed to another Georgetown location for the establishment.
“The bottom line is we hope Mr. Kocak finds a more appropriate place for his business,” Starrels said.
Kocak and the DCRA were unable to be reached for comment.

As students head to wash their inaugural laundry loads this academic year, they will find brand-new high-efficiency Energy Star washing machines and dryers welcoming their dirty clothing.
Installed this summer, the machines, located in every on-campus residence, are part of a university-wide effort to reduce the amount of water the university consumes and the school’s carbon footprint by at least 50 percent by 2020, according to Karen Frank, vice president for facilities and student housing. Since 2006, the school’s new policies have reduced carbon emissions by 20 percent.
Frank said she expects the Energy Star equipment to save over four million gallons of water this year, as well as a significant amount of electricity. Since the university replaces all its laundry facilities on a cycle to avoid widespread equipment failure, “It only made sense to replace [the old facilities] with more efficient equipment,” Frank said.
However, some students have reported problems with the machines. According to Remy Wainfeld (COL ’12), one student washed a load of clothes using half the normal amount of regular, non-high efficiency detergent but was still left with sudsy clothes after one cycle. “Because these front load washers use less water, less detergent must be used,” Frank explained. “The manufacturer recommends using high efficiency (HE) detergent or alternatively using only one-fourth the amount of regular detergent used in the old washers.”
Instructions about how to use the machines are posted in every laundry facility, according to Frank. Magdaly Vargas (COL ’14) said she finds the instructions easy to follow, adding she is happy to see a push toward a greener Hilltop. She has trouble tracking down the recommended high efficiency detergent in local stores, however, saying she wished the product would be made more available to students on campus. While students received a sample packet of high efficiency detergent at check-in, Vargas said the supply is quickly depleted.
High efficiency detergent also costs more than its traditional counterpart, a concern for college students who must also pay to use the university’s facilities. At CVS, a 50-ounce container of Tide Free and Gentle costs $8.99 plus tax, whereas the brand’s high efficiency product costs $9.39. Wainfeld said he thinks the price difference will not adversely affect students, as a container of high efficiency detergent cleans more loads than a container of regular detergent.

University administrators expected the Class of 2014’s yield to be higher than that of previous years, but a lack of funds available for financial aid packages caused the rate to remain at last year’s 43 percent.
Of the 3,643 students accepted to Georgetown for this admissions cycle, 1,580 enrolled this fall, according to Andy Pino, director of media relations.
A significantly higher number of accepted students submitted enrollment deposits in May than the number of students that ended up matriculating this fall, said Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon.
“We have had more students than normal either defer for a year or withdraw entirely even after paying their deposit on May 1,” Deacon said in an email. “While financial aid has always been the No. 1 reason cited by people who do, it seems more than normal this year.”
This year saw an increase in appeals for more financial aid than initially granted, according to Patricia McWade, dean of the Office of Student Financial Services. Deacon attributes this increase to both Georgetown’s high tuition and the overall economic climate.
“It `feels’ like cost and financial aid are more of an issue now and this is no surprise. Families have lost access to an immense amount of liquidity over the last two years, especially in
the decline of home equity, which they frequently used to pay for college, but our costs have not come down, so there is a growing gap in the ability of families to pay and our overall cost,” Deacon said. Fifty-five percent of undergraduates are receiving financial aid this year, according to university spokeswoman Julie Bataille. She stressed that the university is striving to meet all financial needs of undergraduates.
“Given the economic climate, part of our overall strategy is to make sure we can continue to meet full financial need for our undergraduates,” Bataille said in an email. “We continue to plan for increased student financial aid as we monitor the economic climate and plan for our operating budget.”
While Georgetown does not have the endowment resources of peer institutions to cover financial aid concerns, the university plans to cover the necessary costs with increased fundraising, University President John J. DeGioia said in a meeting with student press on Wednesday.
DeGioia stressed the importance of the 1789 Scholarship Imperative, which has garnered positive reception and donations from alumni.
“More money has been donated in the last two years than ever before,” DeGioia said. “We are spending $70 million on our financial aid program this year.”
Other universities are also seeing an increase in financial aid requests. The George Washington University’s Board of Trustees increased its financial aid pool to $148 million this February, according to the GW Hatchet.
Daniel Small, executive director of the office of financial assistance, said that despite the increase in requests, they have not seen an increase in appeals.
“People are more proactive,” Small said to the Hatchet. “They knew what to do ahead of time.”

With the Obama administration’s presentation of $325 million to the District of Columbia and Maryland last Tuesday, public schools in the area received a needed boost toward improvement that could set the tone of the upcoming D.C. mayoral and Virginia gubernatorial elections.
Ten states won more than $3.3 billion combined in Obama’s Race to the Top grant competition, which challenges states to improve their public education systems. Obama’s plan aims to improve America’s ailing public schools by rewarding states that demonstrate promising educational practices.
The grants awarded to Maryland and the District, $250 million and $75 million respectively, are a double bonus for the D.C. area. The money will be used to inject resources into struggling schools and will also gauge teacher effectiveness, largely by assessing student achievement.
The money was also welcome news for D.C. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) and Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D), both of whom are up for re-election this November. Each has placed a heavy emphasis on the Race to the Top competition.
Embattled D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee’s policies on teacher evaluations help lift the District through the ranks of competitors.
For its part, Maryland’s General Assembly passed legislation this year that made growth in student achievement account for 50 percent of teacher assessments.

Like many Georgetown students, Addie Joshua’s (SFS ’13) day is composed of a series of routines: a routine for waking up with the same daily tasks, a routine for getting to class on the same daily path, a routine for getting through days filled with the same daily obstacles and the same daily feats.
But for Joshua, who uses a wheelchair, and other Georgetown students with physical disabilities, those obstacles can complicate even the simplest daily routine.
Going to class can become a maze of cars and curbs when vehicles block the smooth sloping cuts that make sidewalks accessible. Opening doors becomes a chore when handicap buttons do not work properly, Joshua said.
When the snowstorm struck last February and shut down campus, Joshua was unable to leave her dormitory because the sidewalks had not been shoveled to accommodate her wheelchair.
“Georgetown is not a completely accessible campus,” Geraldine Miranda (SFS ’13) said. For Miranda, some regular errands like entering the Office of Student Financial Services in Healy Hall are difficult: The front entrance requires walking down stairs; the back door is typically locked and obstructed by a potted plant.
“I think it is essential for this office to be accessible,” she said. “If it were, then I would not try to avoid going there during the year as I have been doing.”
iranda, who also uses a wheelchair, and Joshua said parked cars block the entrance to classes in Maguire Hall; beverages inside of Leo’s and push buttons across campus are difficult to reach; and desks that must be turned around to be made usable are highly inconvenient.
Beth Goldberg (SFS ’12) was on crutches for five months at Georgetown last year after a leg injury. She said the layout of the Hilltop was a challenge in itself, one that could never be fully addressed. The closing of Tondorf Road for construction meant Goldberg had to use the steps along the Intercultural Center to reach the southwest corner of campus from her apartment in Henle Village.
“Getting around campus in a timely fashion was the greatest challenge because you have to wait for elevators or walk around an entire building with stairs,” Goldberg said.
University officials told THE HOYA that the school does its best to be accessible to students with physical disabilities.
“Georgetown takes accessibility issues very seriously and remains compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act,” university spokeswoman Julie Bataille said in an email.
Students with disabilities said they have received support from the university, but still more can be done to accommodate students in wheelchairs.
“They are doing their part,” said Nancy Oduro (NHS ’13), secretary of Diversability, a new student awareness group for people with disabilities. “They are really trying to make it so that anybody can come to this school.”
The Academic Resource Center has a division devoted exclusively to students with physical disabilities. Many of them turn to the center’s staff when they encounter problems, such as malfunctioning door-entry buttons and other questions of accessibility.
“We work with students [with disabilities] each semester to make sure that they have equal access to education in that semester,” said Katherine Ross, the center’s learning skills specialist who aids students with physical disabilities and chronic health conditions. “Our goal is to level the playing field.”
In terms of accessibility, however, “we definitely don’t do this job in isolation,” Ross said. Instead, the center’s principal responsibility is to guide students to the departments concerned with certain needs.
Ross said that students must be their own advocates in order to increase campus accessibility. “The administration is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and it’s really up to the needs of the particular students who are here,” she said. “If students feel that there are things that aren’t in place that they believe are necessary for them to have access [to], then they need to be the ones to bring it to the attention of facilities management and other offices.”
Bataille said that accessibility for students with disabilities is also a primary concern as the university considers its 2010 Campus Plan.
“This issue is an important priority and is part of the review and design of all building projects on campus. If and when individual issues arise we address them carefully and thoughtfully to meet the needs of individuals on our campus consistent with federal law,” she said.
Students with physical disabilities also called for better education in the university community about the challenges that disabled students face.
“I think a lot of people don’t know about different disabilities,” Oduro said. “But more importantly, they want to know, they are willing to help out in any way they can, and they’re willing to learn more.”

Chaos erupted in Silver Spring, Md., around 1 p.m. Wednesday after a flurry of Twitter updates reported that a gunman had taken three hostages inside the headquarters of Discovery Communications.
James Lee entered the building with four homemade explosive devices attached to himself, and was also seen carrying a rifle, according to The Washington Post. The 43-year-old, whose website declares his hatred for humanity, was protesting The Discovery Channel’s TV shows, which he thought demonstrated their support for overpopulation. Lee also demanded that The Discovery Channel run programs detailing how to save the planet by reversing human destruction.
“Civilization must be exposed for the filth it is. I want Discovery Communications to broadcast on their channels to the world their new program lineup and I want proof they are doing so,” Lee said on his website. “I want the new shows started by asking the public for inventive solution ideas to save the planet and the remaining wildlife on it.”
The company notified its employees when Lee first entered the headquarters’ lobby and directed them to stay in their offices with the doors locked. Lee ordered people in the lobby to freeze. While many fled the area, Lee was able to procure three hostages. He instructed the three men, a security guard and two employees, to lie down on the ground facing the floor.
Police were in contact and negotiating with Lee throughout the ordeal, and they were monitoring the situation with interior security cameras, according to the Post. Employees who were in lockdown procedure were later told to evacuate the complex via a specific stairwell.
any Discovery employees were especially concerned because there is a daycare center, where many employees’ children go during the day, located in the building.
At 4:48 p.m., Lee pointed a gun at one of the hostages. Police, fearing for the lives of the hostages, shot and killed the suspect.
The Discovery Channel posted a statement on its blog thanking the Montgomery County Police and Fire & Rescue services and praising their professionalism and efficiency during the four-hour crisis.

Gushing, she stepped up to the microphone. “I just want to say that you’re the most gorgeous man on Earth,” one student said during the Q-and-A session following Bradley Cooper’s (COL ’97) speech to a packed Gaston Hall Thursday evening.
With interest running high and lines stretching all the way to Red Square, students who did not make the cut were diverted to the Intercultural Center auditorium for a live broadcast of the event.
Cooper, an actor known for his roles in The Hangover and Wedding Crashers, began the talk around 7 p.m. by detailing his acceptance to the university as a transfer student from Villanova.
“I had the greatest experience at Georgetown,” said Cooper, who was an English major in the honors program. “I do think it’s because I was rejected out of high school and I was devastated.”
Cooper described visiting the university while in high school and finding an idyllic college campus. “I swear to God Socrates was teaching in the corner, and there were tons of Frisbees and Golden Retrievers. All the women were from California,” he recalled. “And then I got rejected.”
Once accepted as a transfer student, Cooper said he was thrilled to join the ranks of his Georgetown peers.
He cited a recurring suspicion that he didn’t deserve his spot in the Class of 1997. Even when completing a rudimentary task such as a swipe of his GOCard, Cooper was unnerved by small errors. When the system rejected his motion, he explained he thought he had been found out. ‘
Cooper spoke about arguing with friends at other universities over Georgetown’s then-underwhelming ranking in U.S. News & World Report. He said he told his friends, “Hey, Georgetown doesn’t have an endowment because it’s a Jesuit university. [ ]… Northwestern? Please.”
Following Cooper’s speech, the evening quickly transitioned into a giggle-ridden Q-and-A session in which students asked Cooper anything they dared.
While one student asked Cooper for his water bottle – and retrieved it successfully – another requested he take his shirt off. Though Cooper declined, she persisted by asking for his sock. A third asked him to be her date to the Diplomatic Ball in the spring, a request Cooper respectfully declined. Nevertheless, he granted several hugs.
Asked to lend advice to the students present, Cooper emphasized the importance of possessing a willingness to fail. “Just fall on your face. Who cares? Really, it’s the only way you’re going to learn. The only way. God help you if you never fail.”
And Cooper certainly made an impression.
“Smart, sexy and from Georgetown . my dream man,” Alex McCue (SFS ’13) said.
