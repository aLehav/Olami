Three protesters are suing the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department (D.C. MPD) alleging use of non-lethal weapons against racial justice protesters in the summer of 2020.
The three protesters, who reside in the District, Virginia and Connecticut, filed their lawsuit Feb. 22, claiming they were injured by weapons – including stinger grenades, rubber bullets and flash bang devices – during Black Lives Matter protests throughout the summer, causing injuries ranging from lacerations and bruising to emotional damage and mental anguish. 
The lawsuit, Ferris et al v. District of Columbia, alleges that all three plaintiffs protested peacefully at racial justice demonstrations held in the District in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd and had wounds consistent with stinger grenades, foam or rubber bullets and flash bang devices inflicted by D.C. MPD.
The lawsuit claims the D.C. MPD’s actions violated the First Amendment rights of speech, assembly and petition and the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure. 
Elizabeth Ferris, a plaintiff in the complaint and one of the injured protesters, said she felt the D.C. police’s actions were unjust.
“People sworn to uphold the Constitution, which enshrines the right to protest, should not be attacking and injuring us,” Ferris said in a Feb. 22 press release. “We were there to challenge the institutionalized police violence perpetrated against Black and Brown people in the U.S. In response, the D.C. police doubled down, trampling rights and inflicting injuries on those who would challenge their impunity.”
Katherine Crowder, another plaintiff in the complaint, said the police’s actions were not unique to the protests she attended.
“After I was injured, I witnessed police launching indiscriminate attacks for months, over and over, injuring people standing up against racist police violence in Washington, D.C., and across the country,” Crowder said in the same Feb. 22 press release. “My hope with this lawsuit is to stop the police from carrying out these violent, vicious, and biased attacks. These assaults have to stop in order to protect the next wave of people taking a stand, or a knee, for justice that the police don’t like.”
The Partnership for Civil Justice Fund (PCJF) — a nonprofit legal organization based in D.C. that assists in cases regarding free speech and government transparency — and its Center for Protest Law & Litigation filed the lawsuit on behalf of the three protestors. 
Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, constitutional rights lawyer and executive director of the PCJF, said the lawsuit is a means of holding the police accountable for their actions.
“The D.C. MPD has operated with impunity, violently attacking peaceful protestors demanding police reform,” Mara Verheyden-Hilliard said in the PCJF press release. “The MPD will continue to injure the residents of and visitors to the nation’s capital as long as they think there are no consequences.”
Dr. Kelsey Ball Fomengia, a licensed clinical psychologist and consultant for Georgetown University who specializes in mental health in communities of color and mitigating the physical and mental health effects of trauma, said use of such weapons on protestors can have severe consequences.
“The psychological impact of experiencing race-based violence can be just as damaging and long-lasting as the physical effects,” Ball Fomengia wrote to The Hoya. “Individuals who have experienced systemic racism and abuse during protests often report increased stress, higher heart rates and blood pressure, muscle tension, migraines, sleeplessness, feelings of sadness, outrage, fear, numbness, fatigue, and hopelessness.”
This complaint is far from the first or only lawsuit alleging police violence against protesters, though. Most notably, thousands of protesters marching in Lafayette Square on June 1, 2020 were forcibly cleared using rubber bullets, grenades and tear gas to make way for President Trump’s appearance in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church.
As a result of immense public outrage in the wake of the protest, the D.C. Council unanimously passed an emergency police reform bill that prohibited the use of tear gas, pepper spray, riot gear, rubber bullets and stun grenades by MPD eight days later. However, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) did not sign the bill until July 22, and it only remained in effect for 90 days after it was enacted. 
The PCJF is alleging that within this 90-day period, D.C. police officers continued to indiscriminately use non-lethal weapons against protesters without giving them adequate time to disperse. 
Ball said the protestors’ experiences have the potential to affect more than just themselves and their physical and mental health.
“It is important to note that ‘vicarious trauma’ (i.e. second-hand exposure to traumatic stories through news and social media) can result in many of the same physical and psychological damages as direct exposure,” Ball Fomengia wrote to The Hoya.
Ball said it is important for individuals to advocate for their community while also preserving their mental health.
“Speaking up and demanding change when social injustices occur is often a critical part of one’s healing journey,” Ball wrote to The Hoya. “At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that the fight for justice can be exhausting. Tending to your emotional health and ensuring you have the mental capacity to keep showing up in the pursuit of justice is equally essential.”

The Smithsonian National Museum of Asian Art (NMAA) announced Feb. 21 a historic partnership with the government of the Republic of Yemen to store important heritage artifacts.
NMAA manages over 45,000 artifacts and is one of the largest collections of Asian art in North America. The museum will store 77 cultural objects from Yemen for two years, after which the Yemeni government may request a repatriation, a return of these items to the country.
Ella Weiner, a research assistant for global affairs in the Office of the Director at the NMAA, said the museum is honored to protect the artifacts.
“It is an immense honor to be entrusted with the temporary care and safekeeping of this historic collection of Yemeni heritage,” Weiner wrote to The Hoya. “The preservation of cultural heritage is a core focus area at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art (NMAA).”
The objects include a bronze bowl, folios from early Qur’ans and funerary tombstones. While most objects will remain in storage, some will join the exhibition “Ancient Yemen: Incense, Art, and Trade.” The museum curators aim to engage with the Yemeni community to better interpret the Yemeni objects displayed.
The Saudi Arabia-backed government and the Houthis, an armed rebel group, have attacked Yemen for the past eight years. 
The conflict has taken over 200,000 lives — and cultural artifacts and infrastructure are facing looting and destruction. 
The 77 Yemeni objects were taken out of the country illegally, according to Weiner. The United States obtained 64 of the forfeited objects as a result of investigative efforts by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection intercepted the other 13 objects amidst illegal transport to the United States. 
Mohammed Al-Hadhrami, Yemen’s ambassador to the United States, said he believes that these artifacts will not be safe in Yemen. 
“With the current situation in Yemen, it is not the right time to bring the objects back into the country,” Al-Hadhrami said in a statement to Smithsonian Magazine. “The Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art is a global leader in the field of cultural heritage and preservation. We are pleased to see these objects in their care.”
Weiner said the looting of artifacts robs communities of their history and culture.
“The illegal looting and trafficking of cultural heritage is a huge global problem, and the U.S. is one of the largest market countries where these objects are sold,” Weiner said. “So much of an object’s history and context are lost, and communities are deprived of their heritage.”
Yen-Han Chen (CAS ’25), who was born in Taiwan and is a member of the Asian American Student Association, said that repatriation and the Smithsonian’s handling of the Yemeni objects is a multidimensional issue with no ideal response. 
“The purpose of repatriation is to ensure that the places that have been impacted by colonialism by extractive institutions can regain what they had and make sure their cultural heritage is within their territory,” Chen told The Hoya. “That is, of course, the ideal situation, but if you have Yemen, a state that is, by a lot of means, a very dysfunctional and weak state that cannot guarantee the safety of these artifacts, I think the arrangement we have right now is the best one we can have so far.”
Chase Robinson, the Dame Jillian Sackler director of the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and Freer Gallery of Art at the Smithsonian, said he hopes to make the partnership with the Yemeni government collaborative. 
“Our partnership with the Republic of Yemen Government and its embassy is a powerful example of how shared stewardship of objects can build bridges and serve as a catalyst for learning and understanding, and we look forward to working with the Yemeni community to tell their stories,” Robinson said in a Smithsonian press release. 
Chen said repatriation should be a collaborative process and acknowledges the importance of returning cultural items to formerly colonized nations. 
“If you want to look at [repatriation] from a perspective that is productive and justice-oriented, then it should be a partnership,” Chen said. “It may not be the most popular solution, but I think it is the most productive one, and it is the one that will bring the most good to a more just world — a world where nations that were formerly colonized, post-colonial nations, can regain their artistic possessions.”

Two incarcerated students filed complaints against Washington, D.C., on Feb. 22 for failing to provide adequate special education accommodations for imprisoned students.
The School Justice Project, a legal services and advocacy organization dedicated to ensuring access to education for court-involved students with disabilities, will represent the students in their upcoming trials, along with the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, a committee of civil rights lawyers that works to fight inequity through legal battles, and law firm Nixon Peabody. Since D.C. does not have a long-term prison facility, those who are convicted for D.C. code violations serve time in Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facilities, which are federal prisons.
Sarah Comeau, lead attorney on the case and co-founder of the School Justice Project, said she hopes the lawsuit will bring students home to D.C. facilities, where education is more accessible than at BOP facilities.
“Because D.C. sends its young people to the Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities, they can’t access education,” Comeau told The Hoya. “That’s the whole point of the lawsuit. We want young people to be brought back home so they can enroll in school and access meaningful educational opportunities locally.”
According to a report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, almost 38% of state and federal prisoners had at least one disability in 2016, and Comeau said the District fails to provide disabled students with the option to receive a diploma, access D.C. curriculum or attend special education classes while imprisoned in the BOP.
Comeau said the current system also lacks adult figures for young students to reach out to about their education.
“One of our clients has been working with me for years trying to get education, and the District is very much aware of these issues,” Comeau said. “But there’s no one that they could contact.”
Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), students with intellectual and developmental disabilities or impairments are entitled to an education on par with peers receiving general education. 
“For over a decade, the District has deprived every eligible DC student with disabilities serving a sentence in the BOP the education to which they are entitled for the entire time they are incarcerated away from home,” the Washington Lawyers Committee said in a Feb. 22 press release.
Comeau cited Maya Angelou Academy, a public charter school for court-involved teens, as an example of an organization well-versed in providing education to incarcerated students. 
The school’s model for education, which emphasizes students’ strengths in order to better their ability to build fulfilling lives, is now being rolled out in D.C. facilities and creating change for the better, according to Comeau. 
“They understand the importance of providing a comprehensive and robust, meaningful education to young people,” Comeau said. “So we hope that this lawsuit will bring young people home so they can access that level of service locally.”
Marja Plater, an attorney with the Washington Lawyers’ Committee, said that under IDEA, students are entitled to transition services to help them adjust after their release if deemed necessary.  
“For many people in this age bracket, they do need it and they’re not receiving it,” Plater said. “And that can include vocational skills, training and other support that would help them be able to integrate into the community.”
“Ultimately we want these young people to be educated,” Plater added. “They’re entitled to it, and their rights are being infringed upon at this time.”
Plater said studies show that receiving a high school diploma decreases the likelihood of recidivism and that students transitioning out of BOP facilities face long-term setbacks in their reintegration because of lack of access to adequate education.
“The District is denying young DC residents with disabilities in the BOP their right to an education — plain and simple,” Plater said in the press release. “Young people in the BOP want their education. Their rights matter and they deserve to return home with the skills necessary to reintegrate successfully into the community.”
The committee hopes the lawsuit will help create a system where young people imprisoned in the BOP are either educated at those facilities or housed and educated in D.C.
“Young D.C. residents who are eligible for special education and are housed in BOP should be receiving an education, and they are entitled to it,” Plater said. “And that’s what we’re hoping to change.”

Mayor Bowser and Washington, D.C. Government announced on Feb. 15 new initiatives to assist Black Washingtonians with homeownership.
These efforts will spread awareness about current and new resources available to assist Black residents in securing homes, which tend to decrease racial disparities in homeownership and wealth. These new resources included a Black homeownership workshop, which took place on Feb. 18 at Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library.
One of the workshop’s resources, Financially Fit DC, offers financial education tools and resources to help maintain daily finances. The workshop’s other resource, the Home Purchase Assistance Program (HPAP), provides interest-free loans and contributes to closing costs to help low-income individuals and families buy homes.
Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development John Falcicchio said it is important to acknowledge the government’s past policies barring Black residents from homeownership while finding ways to reverse previous policies’ discriminatory effects.
“Our goal is the first step in acknowledging the implications of our past and the lasting impact it has on our Black community,” Falcicchio said in the Feb. 15 press release. “By closing the racial gap in homeownership, we are investing in the preservation of the culture and identity of the Black community in Washington D.C.”
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) created in June 2022 the Black Homeownership Strike Force (BHSF) — a consortium of government officials, experts and advocates  — to address longstanding housing and other financial discrimination in the District and nationally. 
Bowser said that increased BHSF programming reflects one step towards the D.C.’s goal to increase Black homeowners.
“We set an important goal: to add 20,000 Black homeowners by 2030,” Mayor Bowser said in a Feb. 15 press release. “Now, we’re focused on making sure residents have the resources and support to find and complete their journey to homeownership.”
“When disparities are created through intentional action and discrimination, we must be just as intentional about reversing those disparities,” Bowser added. “And that is what we are doing with homeownership in D.C. Homeownership is a path to generational wealth, it is stability, and it allows you to bet on yourself, your family, and your future.”
Black homeownership in Washington has decreased as home prices and property values have increased. Black homeowners comprised in 2005 about 46 percent of total D.C. homeowners. As of 2022, the percentage dropped to 34 percent, despite Black individuals making up around 46 percent of all D.C. residents. Over the same time frame, white homeownership in D.C. has increased to about 49 percent.
The impact of historic practices implemented to prevent Black homeownership are felt today, according to the BHSF’s October 2022 report which gave recommendations for increasing Black homeownership in the District. 
“The combination of redlining, racial covenants, and discrimination in lending that barred Black residents from the government-backed mortgages available to white families deprived D.C.’s remaining Black households of the economic gain homeownership can bring,” the report read. “These early policies continue to have reverberating effects.”
Redlining originated in the 1930s with discriminatory practices in new government homeownership programs. Government officials used maps to determine who was worthy of new loans and frequently marked predominantly-Black neighborhoods as “too risky” for assistance programs.
The mayor’s push to increase the amount of Black homeowners began with recommendations of the BHSF, which include finding more affordable housing locations, updating zoning and permit processes and streamlining the overall path to homeownership.
Falcicchio said that the resources provided by these new initiatives will have lasting positive and equitable impacts on District families. 
“For every family that comes to a workshop and utilizes D.C.’s homeownership tools, that’s one more family that will call D.C. home for decades and will create generational wealth,” Falcicchio said in a statement shared with The Hoya. “What our housing agencies partners are offering is not simply a course and a certificate, but a fair shot and a pathway to the middle class and beyond.”

Most people can only ever dream of competing on “Jeopardy!” At 19 years old, Caleb Richmond (SFS ’25) has already appeared on the show twice, so far accumulating total winnings of around $40,000 across both tournaments.
Richmond first competed in the “Jeopardy!” 2018 Teen Tournament as a sophomore in high school, advancing to the semifinals and walking away with $10,000 in prize money. The reunion tournament, which brings back contestants who competed in various teen tournaments, featured Richmond in an episode that aired March 2.
Twenty-seven students compete in the tournament, and in his first round, Richmond faced off against two other college students and won to now move onto the semifinals. The winner of the tournament will receive a grand prize of $100,000 and a place in the 2023 “Jeopardy!” Tournament of Champions, which will feature the most successful contestants from the show’s current season, all competing for a grand prize of $250,000.
Richmond said that while the competition itself is important, the highlight of his return to “Jeopardy!” was reuniting with the friends who he made during the high school tournament.
“I’m 19 now, and I’ve known these people since I was 15, and just getting to see them in person was what I was looking forward to the most,” Richmond told The Hoya. “Of course, everyone asks about the game and how that is, but really, what is most important to me is seeing the people.”
“Back then, it was all new, and we all kind of thought it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But this time, we were all so surprised that we were coming back,” Richmond added. “I think we just really took our time to take everything in, in a way that we didn’t get to the first time.”
Richmond said he views game strategy and trivia to prepare for the show.
“There’s an online archive of all of the old games, and I would look through and see what categories I was better at, what I was weaker at,” Richmond said. “Then I would take what I didn’t know, put it into a flashcard deck, and kind of go from there.”
Molly May (CAS ’24), Richmond’s close friend, said she enjoyed having a front row seat to Richmond’s development as a contestant. 
“It has been incredible to witness Caleb continue his Jeopardy career,” May wrote to The Hoya. “I’ve seen him grow so much in his knowledge and self-confidence throughout the process.”
May said her faith in Richmond’s abilities helped encourage him as he prepared for his appearance on the show.
“I’ve watched Caleb practice his trivia knowledge for hours on end, often by watching old Jeopardy episodes,” May wrote. “I knew he would be a great contestant on the show, but sometimes Caleb just needs that last boost of self-confidence.”
Claire Sattler — a senior at Yale University, winner of the 2018 Teen Tournament and current competitor in the 2023 High School Reunion Tournament — told The Hoya that participating in “Jeopardy!” has been the source of unlikely but meaningful relationships.
“I really cannot imagine my life without my ‘Jeopardy!’ friends, which is crazy considering that the things that brought us together was just these two whirlwind, random days in L.A. filming a TV game show when we were high school kids,” Sattler said.
Sattler said she and other contestants had not anticipated returning to the show.
“It felt like a weird homecoming, almost. Because we all really made peace with the fact that we were almost certainly never coming back,” Sattler said.
Sattler said time has brought Richmond and her closer to one another, as she has mentored him through his high school and college years.
“The friendship grew over the years,” Sattler said. “I’m two years older, and I think I definitely served somewhat of an older sister role in his life, which I’m really grateful that I got to do.”
On his part, Richmond said that, given the opportunity, he would love the chance to return to the show again in the future.
“If producers would like to have us back, I will come back instantly,” Richmond said. “I will come back right away.”

Georgetown University student organizations hosted projects and demonstrations throughout the month of February to commemorate Black History Month.
The Black Leadership Forum (BLF), a coalition of clubs on campus that serves Black students, largely facilitated the initiatives. The Black MBA Association (BMBAA), which aims to increase the representation of Black leaders in business, also organized opportunities for students to engage with Black History Month.
Saleema Ibrahim (SFS ’23), a BLF facilitator, said one goal of these events was to increase the presence of the Black student community at Georgetown through a combination of academic, social and scholarship events.
“We wanted to make sure that this month we were very visible on this campus and that we’re putting on events that we enjoy,” Ibrahim told The Hoya. “I enjoyed working with the other student leaders in the BLF, and I know that every club was very intentional and was very successful in the events that they put on.”
BLF required that every club within its coalition organize at least one initiative during Black History Month, according to Ibrahim. Eighteen student clubs were involved in planning 27 events throughout the month.
The Georgetown branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (GUNAACP) coordinated several initiatives around Valentine’s Day, including a panel on intergenerational wealth and a first-year karaoke night.
GUNAACP also organized an educational event about Black health care in collaboration with the Georgetown University Minority Association of Pre-Health Students, a program dedicated to spreading awareness about ethnic health disparities and promoting professional opportunities for minority students pursuing pre-health and medicine.
Autumn Davis (CAS ’24), president of GUNAACP, said all of these events sought to support and elevate Black students through both recreational and educational opportunities.
“The goal of these events was to encourage Black joy and scenes of unity, which I feel are especially important in a world where that is a bit difficult to find,” Davis wrote to The Hoya. “This initiative was especially important during such a celebratory and significant month.”
Arielle Prudhomme (CAS ’23), president of GU Women of Color (GUWOC), said GUWOC hosted dance classes that were a precursor to their annual event celebrating Black women called the BRAVE Summit, which stands for Black, resilient, artistic, vigilant and enough.
“The dance class was all about self love and expression,” Prudhomme wrote to The Hoya. “The theme for this year’s summit is Artistic (a never ending Renaissance), all about tapping in to the art inside all of us and breathing life into it. And I think we got a taste of that during the dance class.”
Prudhomme said GUWOC also hosted an event with Alpha Kappa Alpha, where participants discussed life as a Black woman at a predominantly white institution.
“It was heartwarming to see all the women come together and share our experiences, but it was concerning that the shared sentiment was that Black women do not feel adequately supported on this campus,” Prudhomme wrote.
Maesha Ulcena (GRD ’25), vice president of marketing for BMBAA, said each member of the group’s board selected a business to feature for a Black Business Highlight series on Instagram.
“From business owners we knew personally and wanted to celebrate, to individuals we looked up to in our professional industries, to businesses that spoke to our hobbies, the series was both a great educational opportunity and a reflection of people that make up BMBAA,” Ulcena wrote to The Hoya.
Kilandra Bass (GRD ’25), co-president of BMBAA, said her group organized a number of projects open to both graduate and undergraduate students in the McDonough School of Business (MSB), including a food drive, a potluck night and a weekly happy hour event featuring a Black-owned winery.
BMBAA collected 55 items through the food drive that it will donate to So Others Might Eat, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., that works to break the cycle of poverty and homelessness through a holistic approach.
Bass said the potluck encouraged attendees to bring a dish that reminds them of home, which highlighted numerous Black diasporas.
“That was really cool, because we have people from all over — people from the African continent, people who are African American, people from the Caribbean and then members who aren’t even Black who are a part of our club,” Bass told The Hoya.
Ulcena said she was proud that BMBAA’s initiatives throughout Black History Month resonated with the organization’s values of diversity, social service and community.
“I was really proud of the events and initiatives we were able to put together for Black History Month because we got to carry out multiple core values of both Georgetown and BMBAA,” Ulcena wrote.

The Georgetown University Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life hosted its 10th anniversary discussion on the leadership of Pope Francis Feb. 28.
Initiative Director Kim Daniels and founder John Carr headlined the event, which began with an introduction by Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia (COL ’79, GRD ’95) before moving into a conversation with other Catholic leaders. The event probed the leadership and legacy of Pope Francis, the first Jesuit leader of the Catholic church, and participants discussed the Pope’s challenges, triumphs, shortcomings and message while looking toward his future aspirations.
Panelists included Cardinal Wilton Gregory, the archbishop of Washington, D.C.; Sr. Norma Pimentel, a nun and humanitarian activist; E.J. Dionne, a professor in the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy and a columnist at The Washington Post; and Helen Alvaré, a Catholic social activist and professor at George Mason University’s Scalia Law School.
Daniels said a profound experience in her journey with Catholicism was during the announcement of Francis’ election in St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican City, a city-state located within Rome, Italy, that functions as the headquarters of the Catholic church.
“So many people from around our global church were there in St. Peter’s, and I can’t tell you how it was before that white smoke went up,” Daniels said at the event. “It was joyous; it was raucous; there were people singing.”
Gregory said he could see Francis’ character come through after his papal inauguration, when Francis ate lunch with employees in the workers’ cafeteria in the Vatican City.
“Early on in his ministry, he had lunch with some of the Vatican workers,” Gregory said. “He got his tray, and went and filled his tray and sat down with the workers. I don’t think that’s happened with a lot of his predecessors. He demonstrates that accessibility that I think wins the hearts of a lot of people.”
While official writings from the Vatican and popes in particular are often hard to comprehend for readers outside of the church, Gregory said the writing of Francis is clear to the average reader.
“He writes in a style that people can understand,” Gregory said. “They don’t sound like prior Vatican documents. They are rich, but they are accessible and he’s accessible.”
Pimentel, who was recognized by Francis for her work aiding refugees at the border between the United States and Mexico, said Francis’ emphasis on hands-on activism speaks to efforts of inclusivity in the church.
“He said we have to be one church, and the only way to be one church is to kind of get messed up and dirty, and get out there,” Pimentel said. “Get out there and bring everybody in. I think his message of inclusiveness and encountering the other is really what we all must do.”
Alvaré said Francis promotes fellowship with underserved groups who need prolonged assistance, including immigrants, those in poverty and young people disillusioned by religion.
“When he asks for accompaniment, it’s not for an hour,” Alvaré said at the event. “He’s talking about people who need a long time and require us to change our way of life. You can’t live normally, according to our American standards, and do what he’s asking us to do.”
Dionne said that the actions of Francis hold up when compared to the message of the late U.S. Representative John Lewis of Georgia, who was known for encouraging Americans to engage in good trouble, or trouble necessary for impacting social change.
“I think in the tradition of John Lewis — good trouble — he is a troublemaker,” Dionne said at the event. “He challenges all of us. He attacked the spirit of careerism in the church, called it a form of cancer.”
Pimentel said that Francis taps into a human element that serves as a unifier in a time of staunch division.
“That’s why he speaks about breaking down barriers, coming outward and actually moving and bringing others in,” Pimentel said. “Bringing those who are at the peripheries, those who are at the margins, those who have been left out because we have become a church that is so comfortable in a little bubble that makes us okay, and we have left people out.”

The Georgetown University Ukrainian Society (GUUS) hosted a series of events and protests this week to pay homage to the Ukrainian people one year after the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
GUUS hosted the Feb. 24 event in the Intercultural Center, which featured a choir singing a Ukrainian hymn, prayers led by Peter Mansour and an art exhibit and speeches from Ukrainian students. GUUS students also gathered for a movie screening, marched to a vigil outside the Russian Embassy and rallied at the Lincoln Memorial over the course of the weekend.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has confirmed 8,006 civilian deaths during the Russian invasion as of Feb. 26. An additional estimated 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been either wounded or killed. 
Members of the Georgetown student body and the graduates have stood in solidarity with Ukraine throughout the war, such as through educational speaker events and professors raising over $22 million in humanitarian funds. A $5 million donation from two Georgetown graduates in June 2022 established the Gracias Family Sunflower Current Use Scholarship Fund, which enabled four Ukrainian students to attend Georgetown University on full scholarships and supported several others with merit-based aid.
Kyryl Myronenko (SFS ’26), a Gracias Family Scholar and GUUS organizer, said that while many Georgetown professors focus on Ukraine in their classes, it is beneficial for students to also understand the crisis from a humanitarian perspective.
“Especially here at Georgetown, it’s so important that all the young students, all the future leaders, get an education of not only an academic perspective,” Myronenko told The Hoya. “Everything includes Ukraine, but also it’s important that we students, coming from Ukraine, are able to share our perspective and just spend this time together.”
Myronenko said that for Ukrainian students, being away from home during a time of crisis is a challenge. 
The United States recently received intelligence that the Chinese government has considered supplying Russia with lethal assistance, such as drones and ammunition. Although China has not officially committed to this move, Chinese President Xi Jinping is rumored to be visiting Moscow next week to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Sofia Sulek (SFS ’23), a GUUS organizer who has been actively involved with advocacy efforts for Ukraine since the invasion began, hails from Slovakia, a country neighboring Ukraine. 
Sulek said she still wanted to engage with the Ukrainian cause in any way possible, despite the emotionally stressful nature of the Russian invasion. 
“My country, being neighbors with Ukraine, was affected in the fact that we had so many refugees pouring in,” Sulek told The Hoya. “I immediately, on a personal level, felt like I wanted to get involved and had a responsibility to help out. I was just trying to get to know other people that might be Ukrainian or Eastern European, or from any affected area.”
Olha Kovach (SFS ’26), also an organizer with GUUS and a Gracias Family Scholar, said she appreciates the community and university support, including assistance from the School of Foreign Service with the Feb. 24 event. As part of the event, GUUS set up an art exhibit to honor sixteen Ukrainian students who died fighting for their country. 
Kovach said the exhibit and the stories shared by Georgetown students from Ukraine had a powerful impact on those who attended.
“The Ukrainian students shared their experiences and how war impacted them,” Kovach told The Hoya. “I think it was just really nice that people could hear that and understand what is going on from the students’ perspective.”
Kovach said GUUS plans to host a number of events, including a visit from the Ambassador of Ukraine to the United States Oksana Markarova and a fundraising art fair throughout the Spring semester. 
Myronenko said the Ukrainian community at Georgetown encourages the student body to start conversations and engage with GUUS activism efforts as the war in Ukraine enters its 13th month.
“Do anything you can when you have time, when you have an opportunity. Read the news, speak with us,” Myronenko said. “Even though it’s incredibly hard for us to speak about the war, hard to realize that we are here when everyone is in Ukraine, it’s really important, and we are always very open to tell you everything you would like to learn about Ukraine and Ukrainian society events.”

Kenneth Bond was released from prison with the help of the Georgetown Prisons and Justice Initiative (PJI) after being incarcerated for over 27 years.
Bond was 16 years old when he was sentenced to life in prison, plus 60 years, for a murder that he did not commit. The Baltimore City Circuit Court approved a motion reducing Bond’s sentence under Maryland’s Juvenile Restoration Act (JRA), a piece of legislation passed in 2021 that reduces the sentences of people convicted of crimes as juveniles.
Marc Howard, director of PJI and a Georgetown professor, said the JRA has opened doors for people who committed crimes as youths.
“The JRA allows someone like Kenneth, who was just 16 years old when he was given life in prison, to have the court take a second look at their sentence and consider the person they are today, their accomplishments, and their potential to contribute positively to society,” Howard wrote to The Hoya.
Howard said he taught Bond when he was a student at the Jessup Correctional Institution in 2014 and learned about his story. 
Georgetown students in Howard’s “Making an Exoneree” (MAE) course, which helps advocate for old cases of individuals wrongfully convicted to be reinvestigated, centered Bond in their 2018 documentary.
The course is highly selective and receives around 100 applications for 15 spots. Students spend the semester creating a documentary that makes the case for a wrongfully convicted individual. Students spend time with their “clients” and work to tell the stories of the wrongfully convicted.
Nada Eldaief, Cassidy Jensen and Julia Usiak were three students in the course who worked on Bond’s case. They identified the issues in the eyewitness accounts and Bond’s initial trial. They created a documentary and website to make the case that Bond was not guilty of the 1995 murder. 
They included information about Bond’s private defense attorney, William Monfried, who was unprepared for the trial and disbarred in 2000. Monfried had a history of failing to show up to court proceedings.
Howard then became more directly involved in the legal side of Bond’s case. 
“When we launched the Making an Exoneree program a few years later in 2018, Kenneth’s was one of the cases we selected for our inaugural cohort of Georgetown undergraduate students to reinvestigate. In Making an Exoneree, which is now in its sixth year, small groups of students reinvestigate likely wrongful conviction cases like Kenneth’s, create short documentary films, and advocate for the release of innocent people through websites, social media, events, and petitions.,” Howard wrote.
Howard worked with a team from Cooley LLP and the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project to help support Bond. 
Isabella Todaro (CAS ’23), a student in the MAE class this semester, went to see Bond’s release and said the experience was transformative for her.
“It was absolutely one of the most incredible moments of my life,” Todaro wrote to The Hoya. “It demonstrated how powerful the MAE program is and how tangible the impact of our work can be.”
Bond’s release was the fifth for the Making an Exoneree program. The other releases included Valentino Dixon in 2018, Eric Riddick and Keith Washington in 2021 and Arlando “Tray” Jones III in 2022. Many of these individuals were present to welcome Bond home. 
The JRA allowed for Bond’s release, but he will still need to appear in court to clear his name. 
Bond plans to continue his education and hopes to pursue a degree in psychology. He is set to pick classes at the University of Baltimore in the first few days of being home. He pursued his education while at Jessup. 
“Since earning his GED in 1999, Bond has pursued every available opportunity for higher education, taking courses with a variety of colleges and universities – including Georgetown – through the Jessup Correctional Institution Scholars Program,” according to the Prisons and Justice Initiative’s press release. “He was later admitted to the University of Baltimore’s Second Chance College Program and has excelled academically.”
Howard said that homecomings such as Bond’s are the highlight of his work. 
“This one was particularly powerful and emotional since I have become so close with Kenneth over the past decade, and I am overjoyed to see him back home where he belongs,” Howard wrote.

Georgetown University announced its decision to increase the annual undergraduate tuition rate by 4.9% for the 2023-2024 academic year, the second increase in the last two years. 
In 2022, the tuition increased by 3.5% from the previous school year. Georgetown’s announcement coincides with hundreds of college students’ protests at the U.S. Supreme Court to pass President Biden’s student loan forgiveness legislation.
“The tuition rate reflects a balanced approach to managing rising costs, as well as providing the resources needed for academic and student priorities, new programs and initiatives, and our commitment to minimizing add-on fees,” Provost Robert Groves wrote in a Feb. 21 email to undergraduate students.
Groves said the university will continue to meet the financial needs of all of its students by increasing funds as tuition increases, citing Georgetown’s record-high financial aid budget of $264 million for the 2022-2023 academic year as evidence.
“The university will continue to consider adjustments to financial aid packages when alerted to new family circumstances and to recruit deserving students regardless of their ability to pay,” Groves wrote.
Georgetown based their decision on several different factors, according to a university spokesperson.
“There are a variety of factors taken into consideration in setting tuition rates, including the costs of delivering a high-quality education, available sources of financial aid, projected costs for competitive faculty and staff salaries, student services, technology upgrades, maintenance and improvements to campus facilities, and national price inflation and cost of goods,” a spokesperson wrote to The Hoya.
Shelby Powell (SFS ’26) said she believed the university’s explanation of the causes of the tuition increase was too vague.
“It’s just a blanket statement,” Powell told the Hoya. “It doesn’t really explain the specifics of what’s getting more expensive, but I’m assuming it’s partially because of inflation.”
Powell receives financial aid to cover two-thirds of her tuition, but her family pays the other third. She and her family are worried about whether the same fraction of her tuition will be covered by aid next year, even though the university has pledged to continue giving out aid as needed. 
“It’s kind of uncertain if the aid I’m going to get is going to be proportional to the higher tuition,” Powell said. “Tuition might be increasing — but my mom’s salary is not increasing, so we still can’t pay more.”
Moira Fitzgibbons (CAS ’91), a professor at Marist College and a long-time donor to Georgetown, has two daughters who currently attend the university.
Fitzgibbons said the increase is substantial, but is a logical decision overall. 
“It’s a rather large increase,” Fitzgibbons told The Hoya. “But Georgetown has done a good job of supporting its university students. And as a faculty member at a college, I understand people need to get paid.”
The tuition expenses for the 2021-2022 fiscal year were primarily distributed to instruction — 30% funded professor’s salaries and other class-related programs — followed closely by financial aid at 19.5%, according to the email. The rest of the expenses went toward building maintenance and IT, research and academic and support staff.
Fitzgibbons said that the tuition price and the amount of financial aid given out should stay at the same proportion in order to ensure Georgetown does not exclude students of lower income backgrounds.
“My priority as a member of the Georgetown community is always to be a part of the conversation on what is happening to recruit underrepresented communities to Georgetown — especially underrepresented financial students — so that it doesn’t become a homogeneous country club,” Fitzgibbons said. “If it does, it would lose outside perspectives. It’s important to make sure the tuition price doesn’t scare people off from applying.”
MJ Morales (SFS ’26) is a Coca-Cola scholar and has a full scholarship to Georgetown that remains covered by the tuition increase.
Morales said that she thinks the tuition increase is justified if it goes toward improving undergraduate students’ day-to-day living.
“Georgetown has its fair share of housing problems,” Morales said. “Our hot water goes out a little too often. If the extra tuition is going to be put toward something like that, then I guess I wouldn’t mind it. But I can’t imagine a 5% tuition increase is going exclusively to that.”
Morales said the university administration should have conversations with its tuition payers before finalizing future tuition changes.
“I’m not saying there should be a forum with all thousands of the kids that go to the school and their parents, but there should be more transparency about what the needs of the school are and where tuition would be allocated towards with this increase,” Morales said. “And then gain people’s perspectives on it, as opposed to just sending an email out telling you that your bill is going to get bigger next year.”

A revised “Pathways to Social Justice” requirement will replace Georgetown University undergraduate students’ “Engaging Diversity” core requirement, which has been in place since 2016. The new course will start with the Class of 2027. 
The university’s main campus executive faculty approved proposed changes to the curricular requirement Feb. 24. Beginning in the Fall 2023 semester, undergraduates will be required to take a one-credit, pass-fail seminar titled “Race, Power and Justice at Georgetown,” as well as two other classes in different departments meeting the pathways requirement to more deeply investigate social justice.
Students across all five undergraduate schools can currently choose from a wide array of courses like “Business Arabic” and “Issues in Environmental Justice” to meet their two-course “Engaging Diversity” requirement: one course for “Engaging Diversity: Domestic” and one for “Engaging Diversity: Global.”
Under the new requirement, the “Race, Power and Justice at Georgetown” seminar will teach students about Georgetown’s role in the history of enslavement and racism, according to the subcommittee’s proposal.
“This course will teach Georgetown’s history of enslavement of people of African descent and how that history intersects with national and global experiences of slavery and emancipation, settler colonialism, imperialism, and contemporary struggles for justice,” the subcommittee’s proposal reads. “It will develop a common vocabulary for all Georgetown students to continue to engage in conversations about racial equity and justice and should be taken in the first or second year.”
The 2015 creation of the diversity requirement mandated a five-year review of the curriculum’s efficacy. As part of this evaluation, since fall 2020, over 25 students, staff, faculty and administrators from the main campus’s Core Curriculum Committee, the Georgetown University Student Association and the College Academic Council have worked to review and revise the “Engaging Diversity” requirement as part of the Engaging Diversity Revision Subcommittee. 
The subcommittee found that students would prefer to focus on understanding concepts of justice and power in today’s world for the diversity requirement, according to biology professor Heidi Elmendorf, a member of the subcommittee.
“Some of this was about balancing historical perspectives with modern day perspectives,” Elmendorf wrote to The Hoya. 
“Some of this was about tackling issues of structural inequities of power and privilege rather than relying too singularly on diversity as a standalone concept. And some of this was about looking at our own world — including Georgetown — when we examine these issues rather than always looking elsewhere,” Elmendorf added. 
Amanda Yen (CAS ’23), the student co-chair of the subcommittee, said that the current “Engaging Diversity” requirement aims to allow students to recognize different perspectives, but the requirement’s vague language makes it overly broad and confusing.
“A lot of people didn’t understand what the difference between domestic and global was,” Yen told The Hoya. “Because the language of the requirements itself was so vague and broad, it allowed a lot of different courses to count for the requirements.”
The “Engaging Diversity” requirement is intended to teach students about cultural diversity in both global and domestic contexts, according to the university’s website.
“The engaging diversity requirement will prepare students to be responsible, reflective, self-aware and respectful global citizens through recognizing the plurality of human experience and engaging with different cultures, beliefs, and ideas,” the website reads. “By fulfilling the requirement, students will be better able to appreciate and reflect upon how human diversity and human identities shape our experience and understanding of the world.”
Alex Goodale (CAS ’26) finished the “Engaging Diversity” requirement as a first-year student and said the courses that met the “Engaging Diversity” requirements did not cover concepts she would associate with diversity.
“When I think of diversity, I think of doing something to interact with different communities,” Goodale told The Hoya. “And some of the classes, English classes, it’s like you read a book by a Black author, if you read enough books by Black authors, it counts as ‘Engaging Diversity’ — but that’s not really engaging diversity.”
Yen said the two other courses for the pathways requirement will need to go through committee approval to count as pathways courses. Professors will need to demonstrate how the course curriculum meets three of the five pathways learning goals: inclusive scholarship, intersectional approaches to identity, historical legacies of inequality and their contemporary impacts, imagining justice, as well as national, regional and global comparisons.
“This requirement is interrogating structures of power, privilege and oppression rather than just recognizing the plurality of human experiences,” Yen said.
Elmendorf said the new requirement would allow Georgetown students to be more prepared to tackle issues of social justice by learning from each other and from the past.
“We need to get better at understanding one another, at facing difficult truths with openness and honesty, and at creating societal structures that support — not thwart — thriving,” Elmendorf wrote. “That is the core of social justice. This is an issue about the deepest values of the university, about reckoning with our past, and about being the best we can be in our future.”

The Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle (GUTS) bus will reinstate its weekend service for the remainder of the Spring 2023 semester, according to an announcement by the Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA), the Georgetown University Graduate Student Government and Georgetown University.
Under the new schedule, buses from the main campus to Rosslyn and Dupont Circle will run between noon and midnight on Saturdays and Sundays — a change from the current schedule, which offers no weekend service on these routes. Bus service to the downtown campus at 55 H St. NW will run on Sundays, in addition to existing Saturday service.
GUSA and GradGov, the student governments representing undergraduate and graduate student bodies, respectively, worked with the university’s Division of Student Affairs and Office of Transportation Management (OTM) to establish the pilot program.
“The university, GUSA and GradGov have been working together this academic year to collect information and feedback on students’ transportation needs and preferences and to explore various options for improving transit accessibility,” the Feb. 23 statement read. “The weekend GUTS service pilot will provide another helpful opportunity for assessment and feedback.”
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, GUTS buses went to Dupont Circle on a limited six-hour schedule on Saturday afternoons, and never ran on Sundays. 
GUSA President Camber Vincent (SFS ’24) said weekend service for the route stopped altogether following post-pandemic funding cuts.
He said GUTS weekend service will allow undergraduate students to more easily explore Washington, D.C.’s museums, monuments and nightlife.
“Especially given college students’ schedules, the weekends are arguably the best time to go explore DC as a city and engage with all of its offerings,” Vincent wrote to The Hoya. “GUTS service on the weekend will hopefully allow students to take full advantage of all of the educational, experiential, and professional opportunities that DC has to offer.”
GradGov President Nadia Sarfraz (GRD ’23) said it took time for the organization to effectively advocate weekend service with the university administration. GradGov’s transportation and housing committee and executive board worked jointly to push for expanded service, culminating in a meeting with Vice President of Student Affairs Eleanor Daugherty. 
“It took a lot of back-and-forth communication with higher admin to get them to listen to student voices,” Sarfraz wrote to The Hoya. “The delays in getting this done mostly came from the need for GradGov and GUSA leadership to actually identify where these decisions about GUTS were made.”
On the GUSA side, Vincent said he worked with university officials, including Daugherty, GUTS managers, Vice President of Planning, Facilities Management and Corporate Partnerships Lori Baldwin, Provost Robert Groves, OTM staff and the university’s board of directors to push for weekend GUTS service.
“The main challenge was just coordinating all necessary components of staffing, funding, planning, and communication,” Vincent wrote. “Ultimately we got back the route as funding became available from the Student Affairs office to pay for the route.”
Graduate students will particularly benefit from an easier weekend journey to campus, Sarfraz said.
“A huge win for all of us,” Sarfraz wrote to The Hoya. “Especially for graduate students, who often have to commute to campus on weekends for work, studies, and activities.”
The pilot complements the “Hoya Transit Pilot” program that launched in the Fall 2022 semester, which offers students a $100 semesterly credit to their Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority SmarTrip accounts.
“GUTS on the weekend significantly strengthens our Hoya Transit program for our undergrads, as the combined GUTS to a metro stop then use of the metro light rail is a fast and efficient method to get around the city—free of charge!” Vincent wrote.
In November’s GUSA Senate elections, several candidates made expanded GUTS service a key part of their campaign platforms.
Multiple first-year senators who ran on a platform advocating for weekend GUTS service said that it is critical for making the District more accessible for all students.
“Most students want to get off campus on the weekends but were previously restricted because of the lack of transportation options,” Senator Rhea Iyer (CAS ’26) wrote to The Hoya. “Now, students are able to travel off campus easily and for free. This is extremely important in expanding the ability for Georgetown to explore DC and gain opportunities off campus.” 
“One of the things we hear about frequently is the so-called ‘Georgetown Bubble’ that keeps students secluded from the rest of DC,” Seth Edwards (CAS ’26), another senator who made weekend GUTS service a pillar of his platform, wrote to The Hoya. “Expanding GUTS buses to the weekends means that the bubble will shrink, especially on days when students have the most free time from class.”
Sarfraz said the partnership between GradGov and GUSA strengthened their shared movement and made their advocacy for weekend GUTS service much easier.
“With the persistence of many students and student leaders, we finally had a breakthrough,” Sarfraz wrote. “Uniting grad and undergrad voices have power on this campus.”

CW: This article discusses genocide and violence. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources. 
Every day is full of uncertainty for Daniel Hagos (GRD ’23), a Georgetown University student activist with family in Tigray, the northernmost state of Ethiopia currently in the midst of a state-sponsored genocide. 
Ethiopian government forces have killed more than half a million noncombatants in the Tigray genocide, which has quickly become the deadliest war of the 21st century. Hagos said looming threats of the ongoing violence in Tigray deeply impact Georgetown community members with ties to the region. 
“You don’t know whether or not, at the end of all this, if you’ll have an entire family to go back to or whether they have been physically disabled because of violence or their health is completely compromised,” Hagos told The Hoya. 
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed declared war Nov. 4, 2020 on the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the ruling political party that’s advocating for the Ethiopian federal government to recognize Tigray’s state rights. Ahmed’s order of a military offensive came as a response to TPLF protests in support of Tigray’s autonomy, as TPLF feared that Ahmed intended to disempower the historically marginalized Tigrayans. 
The Tigrayan people continue to endure state violence even after reaching a peace agreement with the Ethiopian government in November 2022 two years into the civil war, resulting in a lack of access to medical care, starvation, sexual assault and media blackouts. 
Despite the peace agreement that the Ethiopian government and TPLF reached over four months ago, Hagos said his contacts in the region have not seen these diplomatic deals translate into tangible improvement on the ground. 
“They will flat out tell you the material conditions really haven’t changed all that much,” Hagos said. “The bloodshed, that is the number of troops and the air bombardments? Yeah, that has slowed down, but you can still suffocate a population through other means.”
State military officials continue to commit mass atrocities and systematically persecute individuals because of their Tigrayan ethnicity, according to Hagos. 
“They went home to home, gathered Tigrayans and slaughtered them, whether it was through bullets, whether it was gathering men and killing them and then tossing their bodies off the cliff,” Hagos said. “And then ultimately, if folks were spared, if they didn’t die, then they face profiling. So if you’re in the capital of Ethiopia, and you’re known to be of Tigrayan identity, they rounded you up and put you in the equivalent of a concentration camp.” 
Melanne Verveer, the executive director for the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and former President Barack Obama’s appointee for the first U.S. ambassador for global women’s issues, said sexual violence is used as a tool of war against the women of Tigray to force its people into submission to the Ethiopian government. 
“Their bodies were the battlefield,” Verveer told The Hoya. “The conflict-related sexual violence was horrific.”
Hagos is calling on Georgetown University graduates in governmental positions of power to take action against the ongoing genocide. 
Due to the university’s strong influence in international affairs, Hagos, who has worked with different members of U.S. Congress on legislation to hold Ethiopia accountable, said he believes Georgetown’s powerful graduates should be doing more to provide aid to Tigray.  
“The one part that really hurts the most is that it’s former alums of Georgetown that sit in pretty prominent roles, either past or present, that could have definitely influenced the outcome of this war,” Hagos said. “And that’s been probably the most deeply upsetting part as it relates to my connection to this institution. There’s folks who have ties to this university that turned a blind eye or chose not to speak up.”
Georgetown graduates and faculty currently hold 28 seats in the 118th U.S. Congress. The university ranks first for the number of chiefs of staff serving in U.S. Congress and second as a producer of congressional members and staffers. 
“Georgetown is so uniquely positioned to say something and do something and be a little bit more firm about it,” Hagos added. “But it hasn’t been the case.”
Although Georgetown has not issued an official statement on the genocide, some university-affiliated institutes have engaged in efforts to raise awareness for the conflict, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Many academic centers on campus have held programming on this issue over the last several years, including the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace & World Affairs and the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS),” a university spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. 
Courses in the School of Foreign Service have also included the conflict in their curricula, the spokesperson said. 
Hagos said the influence of Ethiopian propaganda, U.S. geopolitical interests and stereotypes around Africa as a continent perpetually at war have contributed to why there has been minimal coverage of the genocide.
Building empathy for the Tigrayan conflict is difficult when the United States has also faced criticism for using state violence to discriminate against Black lives, Hagos said. 
“And so if we struggle with that, here in the states, we’re asking for attention several thousand miles away in the Horn of Africa, it’s going to be hard to garner a captive audience,” Hagos said. 
Troops from the neighboring nation Eritrea, which has long harbored animosity against the TPLF, have aided Ahmed in his attacks against the Tigray region. Eritrean soldiers have specifically targeted and displaced the Irob people, an ethnic minority within Tigray who live at the border between the two nations. 
Tesfaye Awala, the board chair of Canada-based advocacy group The Irob Anina Civil Society, said the Eritrean invasion of the Irob region has included mass killings, rape and destruction of infrastructure. 
“I can’t have any words to express how the Eritrean force behaves,” Awala told The Hoya.
Awala said the Eritrean government massacred five of his cousins. 
After two years of no contact with his parents, who are still living in the Irob district of Tigray, Awala learned through a secondhand report that Eritrean forces beat his father nearly to the point of death. 
“He played dead, they beat him so much,” Awala said. “He is in late 70s to early 80s. He was unconscious after they beat him.”
Awala said he was unable to talk to his father until three months after the incident, which is when he learned that his family could not find medical treatment even after seeking out hospitals in multiple nearby cities.  
“There was no medical help,” Awala said. “Everything was looted and destroyed. I just got some information, secondhand information, that he is still alive but still without treatment and even his bones were broken.” 
Awala said he fears the Irob ethnic group is under threat of complete disappearance if the violence continues. 
“They have been attacked again and again by the Eritrean regime and the Eritrean regime seems to be so determined to erase this minority,” Awala said. “We want to be able to survive. It is very, very likely that this minority is going to be erased if there is no intervention sooner than later.”
Awala said international recognition of the conflict as a genocide is a key step toward securing stable humanitarian rights for Tigray. 
“I think the first thing is to recognize what happened and call it a genocide,” Awala said. “That’s the start for more actions. The powers, especially the U.S., need to know there won’t be any sustainable peace without justice and accountability.”
Hagos said he considers Georgetown community members who continue to ignore this genocide to share culpability in perpetuating and enabling the violence. 
“Every single alum of Georgetown, who works in the federal government, specifically the State Department, and has had any level of influence regarding Tigray, I hope that you continue to press the issue if you have been advocating for accountability, justice and peace,” Hagos said. “If you have stayed silent, in my opinion you are complicit.”
