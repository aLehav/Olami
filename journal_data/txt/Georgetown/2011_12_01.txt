Twenty-six landlords have signed the university’s landlord pledge, but according to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, the initiative has elicited anger from others.
The document, which asks local landlords to commit to addressing issues affecting quality of life in the community and mandates that they comply with D.C. law and license properties with the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, was sent to landlords in mid-October.
Kerr said that most landlords have responded well to the pledge and signatories represent 53 properties in West Georgetown and Burleith.
“We’ve received a great response so far,” Kerr wrote in an email to members of the press. “We believe that landlords renting properties to students have an equal role to play in maintaining the quality of life in our historic neighborhoods, and we are grateful to those who have signed the pledge.”
The university publishes the names of those who have signed the pledge on its website, with the hope that students will consult the list before selecting off-campus homes.
However, Kerr said that some landlords were upset by the invitation to sign the pledge and informed the university that they would not obtain a business license, violating D.C. law.
“We heard from several landlords who were upset … enough by [the pledge] that they wanted to express their displeasure to us. [This] suggests that we have started a conversation that is worth having,” she told The Hoya. “I think that it proves that there is an issue to be dealt with.”
The landlord pledge also faced scrutiny at a hearing on the university’s 2010 Campus Plan before the D.C. Zoning Commission Nov. 17.
Zoning Commissioner Michael Turnbull questioned the wording of the document.
“How effective is this pledge? There’s nothing legally binding on that pledge. There’s no real teeth in that,” he said.
However, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said that the pledge has the potential to affect landlords’ reputations.
“I think that [the pledge has] teeth in that … no landlord wants to be on the bad list or not on the good list of the university,” he said at the hearing. “We’re working actively to engage and educate our students … and while there are certain kinds of teeth this approach may not have I think it does have important reputational teeth that landlords do care about.”
He added that the outpouring of anger from some landlords shows that the pledge is effective.
“Several landlords who don’t have basic business licenses have called us to complain, some rather heatedly, that we’re getting too much into their business here. We take that [as] a sign that we have touched a nerve, that we’ve made a difference,” Olson said.

As students prepare for final exams, the administration is working on completing its own test – the Middle States Commission on Higher Education reaccreditation.
Required of colleges and universities every 10 years, reaccreditation confirms that the university is operating in accordance with the standards of the commission and the U.S. Department of Education.
“It’s like a Good Housekeeping seal of approval,” Associate Provost Marjory Blumenthal said. “It’s a mark of prestige, but also a method of determining federal financial aid.”
This year, Georgetown has opted to follow a custom approach to the accreditation process. Instead of a comprehensive self-study, the university will participate in the new option of evaluation in “selected topics.”
The development of the self-study began in February 2010, and the university is now in the process of the self-evaluation.
University officials feel that 10 of the commission’s 14 standards have been sufficiently achieved based on a comprehensive collection of internal documentation.
Two representatives from the commission reviewed the collection of over 1,400 documents that demonstrate that the university meets the commission’s criteria.
“They said it was the best documentation presentation they had seen, and it could be a model for Middle States,” Blumenthal said.
The remaining four standards – planning, institutional assessment, general education and assessment of student learning – will be evaluated through self-study by administrators, faculty and students.
“I think the contribution our self-study will make to the community will be to provide in one place an integrated discussion of how we do planning at different levels,” Blumenthal said. “Putting that all together will be a contribution to the community even though we’re motivated by an outside group.”
A committee of faculty from the four undergraduate schools is examining the coherence of the general education standards across the four colleges and will remain intact after the accreditation process is over to act as a faculty academic council.
“We didn’t do as good a job as we might have done at explaining why it is we ask students to take these courses, even though we’ve been asking them for over 30 years,” Blumenthal said. “Self-study will provide a more coherent discussion and talk about assessment of how well students are doing.”
A committee led by Swarthmore College President Rebecca Chopp will begin to evaluate Georgetown’s self-study in early April. The Middle States Commission will meet in June to decide whether to grant the university reaccreditation.

November saw an increase in the number of thefts and alcohol-related incidents reported by the Department of Public Safety as well as a moderate uptick in crime overall.
Overall, the number of reported incidents increased 22 percent from 45 to 55.
Thefts jumped 35 percent from 17 in October to 23 this month, reaching a high for this academic year. Theft remained the most commonly reported crime, accounting for 42 percent of incidents.
However, this number remains lower than the 28 thefts reported last November, when 17 laptops were reported stolen during a rash of thefts.
Of the 23 thefts reported, all but five are still under investigation. One other case also remains open, involving padlocks that were cut from the posts at the main gates.
Alcohol incidents rose this month, too, with DPS reporting 10 alcohol-related offenses. After thefts, alcohol offenses represent the second-largest portion of cases. All of the cases reported this month were referred to the Office of Student Conduct for disciplinary action.
The number of DPS citations for alcohol has increased steadily throughout the academic year, with one in September and six in October.
Seven of the 30 other incidents reported were either handed over to the Metropolitan Police Department or were directly handled by DPS officers, while 22 were referred to the Office of Student Conduct.
The remaining five cases, including two thefts and three incidents of defacing property, have been closed with no leads.

More than $200 in cash was stolen from a Vital Vittles office at 1:08 p.m. Thursday, according to The Corp’s Chief Executive Officer Alexander Pon (COL ’12).
Pon said that employees noticed a man entering the convenience store’s back office and fleeing with the cash. The suspect pushed a Vittles employee out of the way as he left the store. Employees followed the man to his car, which was parked outside the Leavey Center but were unable to apprehend him. The Department of Public Safety and the Metropolitan Police Department responded to the incident and are managing the ongoing investigation.
According to Pon, the money had been left unsecured for 30 seconds while a manager was on his way to count it.
“It was in that intermediate time the suspect entered our back office area,” he said.
A DPS public safety alert emailed to the campus community at 7:40 p.m. Thursday stated that $600 had been taken from the store, a number which Pon said was incorrect.
“I know for a fact … the number in the PSA is wrong,” he said.
The PSA identified the suspect as a light-skinned black male about 5-foot-8 in height and wearing blue jeans and a gray sweatshirt. His car was described as a black SUV.
 
The Corp Chief Operating Officer Brooke Heinichen (SFS ’12) did not believe that the man was affiliated with The Corp.
“It was not anyone that we recognized,” she said.
Pon added that the suspect did not appear to be of college age.
According to Heinichen, the man’s image was captured by the convenience store’s security cameras, which were installed in Corp locations in the past few weeks as part of routine safety improvements.
“We were able to review tapes and provide DPS with significantly more information than we would have been able to without the cameras,” she said. She added that the employees were also able to note the license plate on the suspect’s car.
Representatives of DPS could not be reached for comment at press time.

A group of about 50 students, professors and D.C. residents gathered to discuss the Occupy movement in the ICC auditorium Tuesday night.
The event, organized by Georgetown Occupy, included a panel discussion and breakout session aimed at identifying the nature and goals of the Occupy protests.
The discussion ranged from the event’s theme of “What is Occupy?” to the 2008 economic crisis and problems with American culture.
“The greatest thing that Occupy Wall Street has done so far is change the conversation,” said Michael Kazin, a history professor and panelist at the event. “It’s got people in the media and outside the media talking about all kinds of things we’d like them to talk about.”
Still, Kazin voiced concern about the movement’s lack of structure.
“The structureless-ness … is unsustainable,” he said. “In the end, there are no leaderless movements.”
Barbara Wien, a professor in the justice and peace studies department and a frequent attendee of the Occupy protests, said that the conception that the protesters lack goals is false.
“The Occupy movement has very clear goals and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise,” she said, listing stricter regulation of financial institutions and cuts to military spending as primacy concerns for the movement.
During her turn on the panel, Wien left the stage and walked among the audience members.
“I’m going to interrupt this culture right here, this hierarchy,” she said, pointing to the stage. “That’s what the Occupy movement is about, is interrupting culture.”
Wien also discussed her hopes for expansion of the protests in the coming months.
“The encampments are just one small part of this movement. They’re going to be doing housing takeovers for people who have lost their homes due to predatory lending … They’re going to be taking over malls … They’re also calling for the birth of a new hybrid political party,” she said. “We live in the most exciting time probably in the history of the world right now.”
After the panel, the audience divided into two smaller groups to discuss the issues informally.
Samuel Geaney-Moore (SFS ’12), a member of Georgetown Occupy who stayed for the breakout session, said that he attended the event in order to show his support for the working class.
“The thing I care about the most is the struggle of the working people in the United States,” he said. “This is a way … to fight the inequality.”
According to the panel’s moderator, Madeline Grayson Howard (COL ’12), the goal of the event was to attract a wider group of people involved in the Occupy movement.
“We really wanted to get more contact with people who have these tendencies,” she said. “I think that it was pretty successful because we reached a lot of people who I have never met before.”

Bryan Kasper, an assistant dean of the School of Foreign Service, will leave the university for a position in the U.S. State Department at the end of the semester, according to SFS Director of Undergraduate Studies Mitch Kaneda.
Kasper is a first year student adviser and curricular dean for international politics majors. He has been at Georgetown since 1998 and with the SFS for six and a half years. Kasper previously worked in the Office of Student Affairs, Housing and Conference Services and the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.
“Dean Kasper has been the ‘brain, muscle and heart’ of the SFS Dean’s Office,” Kaneda wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He would resolve complex academic and student personal issues, while not hesitating to step up to tasks beyond the call of duty, at the same time as balancing … fairness in light of university rules and the need of the students.”
Kasper is responsible for all students in the international politics major. With 150 students per class, the major is the largest in the SFS, but students said Kasper was able to develop personal relationships as he helped them formulate their schedules and explore academic options.
“He gave you the information you needed and wanted to hear,” Michael Hogan (SFS ’14), an international politics major with a concentration in security studies, said. “He made the declaration process really straightforward so you [could] walk yourself through.”
Kasper has represented the SFS on the university’s Bias Reporting Team, the Overseas Study Advisory Committee, the Student Conduct Judicial Hearing Board and the University Honor Council.
“We will miss Dean Kasper greatly, but at the same time wish him the very best as he pursues his professional interest in the U.S. government,” Kaneda wrote in an email sent to SFS undergraduates Wednesday.
The SFS Dean’s Office will appoint an interim dean to take over Kasper’s duties as he transitions out of his role, according to Kaneda.

Fr. Edward Bodnar, S.J., a retired classics professor, died Tuesday morning at the age of 91.
A graduate of Gonzaga and Princeton Universities, Bodnar was ordained in 1952. He taught in the classics department at Georgetown from 1967 until his retirement in 1991.
Bodnar served as a mentor for many students and faculty members and kept in touch with students, some who graduated more than 30 years ago, according to Catherine Keesling, an associate professor of classics.
“The thing that students took away from learning with Ed … was a long-term friend,” she said.
Bodnar officiated at the marriages of several former students and baptized the children of members of the university community, including Keesling’s.
According to Fr. Charles Gonzalez, S.J.,(CAS ’56), a lecturer in the theology department and the rector of the university from 1988 to 1994, Bodnar was a fixture in the Jesuit community. “As a spiritual guide, he was direct and compassionate, speaking with a conviction learned over years of deep companionship with the Lord,” he said.
Bodnar remained a presence within the classics department and the Catholic community after his retirement and could be seen frequently strolling through campus with his signature Walkman.
“I remember seeing him at Mass and being very impressed that he was still actively saying Mass and participating in the community. You could tell he still really cared about students and the community,” Adrienne Lane (SFS ’14) said.
Bodnar played an integral role in the development of the classics program at Georgetown,  according to Keesling.
“For years, he was the classics department,” she said.
Bodnar’s work focused on the writings of Cyriac of Ancona, a 15th-century Italian merchant, and the study of Renaissance travel in Greece, a subject that has become increasingly popular among classics scholars in recent years, according to Keesling.
“It was nice that he lived to see lots of people get suddenly interested in this subject that was his life’s work,” Keesling said.
According to Provost James O’Donnell, Bodnar also impacted members of the university outside of the classics department and Catholic chaplaincy.
“Priest, scholar and Hoya, his gentle way, his keen intellect and that distinctive twinkle will be remembered by many, including a provost for whom he has been his ‘oldest’ Georgetown friend, dating from our meeting in Woodrow Wilson’s living room 35 years ago,” O’Donnell wrote in an email announcing Bodnar’s death to the university community Tuesday evening.
Each year, the classics department holds the Bodnar Lecture featuring a renowned classics scholar. The annual event will be continued posthumously in Bodnar’s honor and is scheduled for March 26, 2012.
A wake will be held for Bodnar today from 3 to 5 p.m. and from 7 to 9 p.m in Wolfington Hall, and his funeral will be held Saturday at 10 a.m. in Dahlgren Chapel. Bodnar will be buried in the Jesuit cemetery on campus.

Members of the Georgetown University Student Association’s Finance and Appropriations Committee finalized a proposal Wednesday that allocates funds from the Student Activities Fee Endowment to the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, Georgetown Energy and the New South Student Center renovation effort.
The GUSA senate will vote on the document Sunday. If it passes, students will vote on the proposal in a referendum from Jan. 24 to Jan. 26.
In marathon meetings held Tuesday and Wednesday, Fin/App reviewed endowment proposals submitted by the three student groups. The committee voted unanimously to allocate $1.25 million to the SIPS Fund, $250,000 to Georgetown Energy’s initiative to install solar panels on the roofs of university townhouses and $1.6 million to the construction of an outdoor terrace on the south side of the New South Student Center.
The Healy Pub proposal, originally a primary recommendation of the commission set up to review all ideas, was deemed infeasible.
The committee also voted to allocate the remaining $450,000 of the $3.57 million endowment to the renovation of the NSSC’s first level. Because this construction is projected to cost more than $600,000, the remainder of the construction costs for the first level would be paid using interest gained on the endowment. Interest gained beyond the renovation costs would be given to the SIPS Fund, if the proposal passes both the senate vote and referendum.
Proponents of the New South renovation project also requested funding for three fireplaces and a skylight, which the Finance and Appropriations Committee elected not to provide.
Senator Zach Singer (SFS ’15) argued that of the three projects, the New South Student Center would make the most tangible difference for Georgetown students.
“I see NSSC as an opportunity too good to pass up and too good to shortchange,” he said.
But in Tuesday’s meeting, SIPS fund co-founder Nick Troiano (COL ’12) criticized the New South Student Center proposal, questioning its long-term impact and influence outside of the university.
“Anyone can think of ways to make their own lives marginally better. How do we use our own potential to make a difference?” Troiano said.
Troiano explained that he was ultimately satisfied with the funding that the committee voted to allocate to the SIPS fund, which plans to use its endowment money to support student service projects.
Georgetown Energy initially requested funding for solar panel additions to the roofs of 43 townhouses but revised its request when it determined that some roofs might not be able to physically support the installation. Fin/App’s plan would allocate funding for all 43 townhouses, and money that is not spent by May 2012 would be moved to Georgetown Energy’s Green Revolving Loan Fund. The GRLF will be managed by the SIPS Fund and finance future student-run energy projects.
Georgetown Energy’s proposal aroused controversy Tuesday when Senator Daniel LaMagna (COL ’13) announced that two of his constituents, Tyler Eldridge (COL ’13) and Evan Abrams (SFS ’12), claimed that Georgetown Energy had stolen concepts from their plans for a revolving sustainability loan fund, which would be facilitated by a student group called The Fund.
Members of Georgetown Energy refuted the accusations at Tuesday’s meeting, pointing to the existence of approximately 170 similar green funds at other institutions. The group also claimed to have several emails proving that the idea was discussed before Georgetown Energy was aware of The Fund.
Fin/App Chair Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) said that the accusations were an issue separate from the meeting’s student activity endowment allocation discussion. Abrams declined to comment because of continuing discussions between The Fund and Georgetown Energy, and members of Georgetown Energy declined to be interviewed for the same reason.
At Wednesday’s meeting, Malkerson said that the two groups had come to a mutual agreement and will submit a joint letter of recommendation to the SIPS Fund on how to best implement the GRLF.
“Both sides are happy,” he said.

The cause of a partial building collapse at an empty storefront at 1424 Wisconsin Ave. remains unknown after Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs work crews investigated the site Wednesday.
Helder Gil, public information officer for the DCRA, said that the inspectors had not yet determined the reason for the collapse because of large amounts of rubble at the site.
“The initial report … was that the collapse was caused by a gas leak, but as far as we can tell that was not the case,” he said.
DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services responded to the collapse on Thursday afternoon after being contacted by an unidentified person.
Oscar Mendes, acting public information officer at DC Fire and EMS, also reported significant damage to a vacant building at 1422 Wisconsin Ave., which neighbors the collapsed building. The building at 1426 Wisconsin Ave., which houses Major, a clothes and shoes retailer, also sustained some damages.
The Metropolitan Police Department was also called to the scene of the collapse to assist in closing off a portion of the street for pedestrian safety, according to public information officer Anthony Clay. Neither DC Fire and EMS nor MPD reported any injuries.
Work crews visited the site on Wednesday, but Gil said that he could not estimate when the cause of the collapse would be determined. He added that the site is too dangerous to perform thorough investigations until the rubble is safely removed.
“It really depends on how fast and how safely we can [remove the rubble],” Gil said.
The building at 1424 Wisconsin Ave. was due to be partially torn down before it was damaged in the incident last week. The demolition permit was issued earlier this year and is set to expire on Aug. 16, 2012, according to Gil.
The permit was granted to M Street Five Limited Partnership, with an owner address listed as Axent Realty Group in Potomac, Md.  Axent Realty owns several shops in Georgetown and commercial properties in both Maryland and Virginia, according to their website.
Gil said that none of the buildings have been condemned and that the damage appeared to be limited to 1424 Wisconsin Ave. and the two adjacent properties at 1422 and 1426 Wisconsin Ave.

Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E voted to approve the first phase of a District Department of Transportation project that would restrict traffic on Wisconsin Avenue to allow for widened sidewalks and the addition of bike lanes.
The project, which was proposed at ANC2E’s monthly meeting on Monday, would limit vehicular traffic to a single lane going either direction during all non-rush hour times to allow for the expansions.
According to DDOT project manager Paul Hoffman, who presented the proposal, the six-month project would begin in March 2012 and reach completion by the fall.
The changes would affect the stretch of Wisconsin Avenue between Whitehaven Parkway, where the university has administrative offices, and Massachusetts Avenue. This section of the road lies within the boundaries of Glover Park and ANC3B.
Ben Cohen, the treasurer of ANC3B, pointed to the positive effects of the project, including increased pedestrian safety and increased visibility for Glover Park’s commercial district along Wisconsin Avenue.
At the meeting, neighbors and commissioners expressed apprehension about the plan. Jake Sticka (COL ’13), the ANC2E Commissioner whose constituency includes most Georgetown students, questioned Hoffman about the project’s impact on Georgetown University Transportation Service.
“Making the left turn, it’s tight, and occasionally the buses can delay traffic,” Sticka said, pointing out that if the project goes ahead as planned the proposed addition of parking lanes would further limit the GUTS buses from making proper left turns at Whitehaven Parkway.
Hoffman said that there would be sufficient clearance for the bus service to continue running normally.
Further opposition was raised by a resident of Burleith, who asked DDOT if traffic diverted by the construction would disrupt the community by running through residential streets. According to Hoffman, DDOT is not able to control how traffic will be affected by the changes.
“Traffic, like water, finds the path of least resistance,” he said.
ANC2E Vice Chair Bill Starrels endorsed the first phase of the project but asked for greater inclusion of local residents in the process in order to avoid misinformation.
In the end, the motion to tentatively endorse the project passed unanimously.
Also on the commission’s agenda Monday was the improvement work being done to O and P Streets. According to ANC2E Commissioner Jeff Jones, new water mains will be completely installed by January. The new mains will be made of copper and will replace the lead ones currently in place.

The School of Foreign Service announced Tuesday that it will introduce two new Master of Arts degrees in hopes of giving students an edge in changing industries.
The Global Human Development and Asian Studies degrees will both begin to enroll students next fall and will be awarded for the first time in 2014.
The Global Human Development graduate program, which was approved last summer, will be open to 20 students.
“The program is trying to look forward [to] what the development challenges are going to be over the next 40 or 50 years,” Ann Van Dusen, interim director of the Global Human Development degree, said.
The program intends to help foster the practical skills needed for global development.
“It is a very applied and practitioner-oriented degree, which distinguishes it from many others,” Van Dusen said.
She added that she believes that businesses will begin to view an understanding of global development as crucial to success.
“It is going to be a relatively quick change from businesses looking at work in developing countries as sort of corporate responsibility — one step beyond charity — they are moving from that to seeing this as part of their business strategy,” she said.
The requirements of the program include courses in the economics and politics of development, project design and evaluation, financing, management and technology.
According to Van Dusen, one of the unique features of the degree, which is targeted at those who already have professional experience in development, is the required international work project between a student’s first and second year in the program.
“It will build [students’] skills as well as their networks,” she said.
The Master of Arts degree in Asian Studies will be housed at the National Resource Center for East Asia, which is funded by the U.S. Department of Education.
Victor Cha, the director of the new degree, believes the university can benefit from reaching out to China. University President John J. DeGioia has also made outreach to the region a priority.
“Georgetown is very interested in expanding its national and international profile on Asia,” Cha said. “The best way to do that is by having  a serious graduate degree program.”
According to Cha, the curriculum will give students a broad knowledge of Asia in addition to a focus on one or two of three specializations — politics and security, political economy and business or history and society.
Students will also learn Chinese, Japanese or Korean and, if they choose, a sub-regional specialization.
Cha believes the new degree is long overdue.
“So many people were coming here for years surprised that we didn’t have a graduate program on Asia,” he said. “We’re very happy to get this through the university.”

Celebrating a revamped website and increased submissions, the university’s journal of culture, communication and technology re-launched Thursday.
Gnovis, a peer-reviewed journal and academic blog run by graduate students in the Communication, Culture and Technology program, saw a sharp rise in articles submitted by graduate students in the United States and seven other countries this year.
“Students are more aware of technology and how to use it …so I think that coincides with the exponential number of submissions we have been receiving,” Editor-in-Chief Lauren Barnett (GRD ’12) said.
The journal’s spring 2011 issue published 12 papers with a 19 percent acceptance rate for submissions, according to Managing Editor Colleen Valentine (GRD ’12).
Gnovis addresses subjects such as technology, media, politics, arts and culture and is released online each spring and fall. This year, the journal published its first summer multi-media edition.
The journal was first launched in the fall of 2000 as a student-organized initiative. After its formation, it underwent a dormant period and relaunched in 2002. The completion of the new site marks the culmination of a remodeling that began in August 2007.
“We redid our website over the summer and that was a big project for us. At this point, it’s about continuing the momentum that we’ve built around this new website,” Barnett said.
A staff of student bloggers posts daily on the updated website. The increased volume of blog posts this semester has been facilitated by the new site design, according to Alicia Dillon (GRD ’12), Gnovis’s lead blogger.
“We work on Word Press now, so it is a different platform, but the process for blogging has remained the same,” she said.
While the bloggers are students and members of the core staff at Gnovis, the journal relies on submissions from scholars in the field. Like many academic journals, the publication is peer reviewed and employs a double-blind review process.
“We try to offer for students … a way to experience the peer review process,” Barnett said. “We have received feedback from those graduate students that feel like that’s a worthwhile cause and say that that has definitely helped them look at their academic projects in a different light.”
According to Davis, she and other staff members have been designing a downloadable version of the publication.
“I think it’s really important moving forward with the prevalence of tablet readers and the way people are reading … to have that option as a viable alternate,” Davis said.

It’s been almost a week since Derrik Sweeney (COL ’13) was released from police custody in Cairo, but the experience is still fresh in his mind.
“It’s mind-boggling that now I’m here, texting with my friends in Missouri, considering where I was two days ago,” he said Wednesday.
Sweeney and two other American students studying abroad at the American University in Cairo were detained in Egypt Tuesday for participating in protests in Tahrir Square.
After being held for more than three days, the students were released Friday and returned to the U.S. on separate flights.
Sweeney landed in St. Louis late Saturday night and was met at the airport by about 30 friends and family members. He addressed reporters after landing and has since appeared on The Today Show and been interviewed about his experiences by media organizations across the nation.
“It’s been extraordinarily peaceful and happy, even despite the hectic interviews,” Sweeney said.
Next semester, he plans to return to Georgetown and continue to study Arabic.
“It’s only strengthened my desire to study Arabic and be back in the Middle East in some capacity,” he said.
Sweeney emphasized the difference between the way that the three Americans were treated and the brutality that he said is being directed against Egyptian protesters.
“The treatment of Egyptians back there is horrible from what we faced,” he said.
While Sweeney said he feared for his life during the detainment, he thinks that being an American citizen helped improve the conditions he was held in.
“After the first time we spoke to someone from the embassy, we were pretty sure we weren’t going to get executed, so that was a nice step,” he said. “But I think that until we boarded that plane, we weren’t sure if we were going to make it back.”

Taxi fares in the District could rise by as much as 83 percent if a rate increase proposal is approved by the D.C. Taxicab Commission later this month.
The commission held a hearing Tuesday to debate the proposal, which was submitted by independent taxi operator Nicholas Maxwell.
The plan would increase to the per-mile rate from $1.50 to $2.75, while dropping the starting fee from $3.00 to $2.75 and eliminating surcharges.
At the meeting, several taxi drivers called the increase insufficient and instead called for a plan that would keep the current starting fee and surcharges and change the per-mile rate from $1.50 to $2.00.
The commission is expected to make its final ruling on the changes Dec. 13.
Though they debated the specifics of the plan, many taxi drivers agree that there is need for reform. They said that District taxicabs have one of the lowest fare rates in the nation, though the cost of living has steadily increased.
“I just want a fair fare,” Mussie, a D.C. taxi driver who did not want to provide his last name, told The Hoya.
Since the taxicab union was a major backer of D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray’s campaign for office, some speculate that Gray will be partial to the proposal.
“Certainly any politician is going to work to reward his supporters once they’re in office,”  Jack Jacobson, a spokesman for taxi rider advocacy group DC Taxi Watch, told the Washington Examiner. “I would hope that’s not the case here, but it certainly looks that way.”
Mussie said he voted for Gray because he seemed favorable to taxi drivers.
“I voted for Mayor Gray because he … listens to the city,” he said.
The mayor’s office declined to comment.
