The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security has striven to incorporate the female role in peace and security agreements, negotiations and movements since its inception in December 2011. It is now at the forefront of women’s involvement in international affairs characterized by a rapidly changing global landscape.
“The institute was established with an ambitious but focused objective: to serve as a hub for knowledge, innovation, research, information and a platform to better understand and illustrate to the effect of women’s participation in peace and security efforts and what impact that has,” GIWPSAssistant Director Mayesha Alam said.
The institute, which was launched by honorary founding chair Hillary Rodham Clinton, has been hailed as a vital effort to ensure women’s roles in peacekeeping efforts.
“We are trying to look at the gap about why women are such powerful actors in the grassroots civil-society sector but their role is not translated into formal peace negotiations. Why aren’t women getting a seat at the table?” GIWPS Research Assistant Hannah Beswick (GRD ’14) said.
Currently, the institute is focusing on how women find success in peacekeeping negotiations.
“Right now we are trying to narrow our case studies and focus on cases where women were active in civil-society efforts but also active in the actual, formal process. We’re looking at these success stories to see what made these women successful,” Beswick said.
On campus, the institute, which is housed in the School of Foreign Service, created its first graduate-level seminar this semester: “Women, Peace and Security.” The course is jointly led by Alam andGIWPS Executive Director Melanne Verveer (I ’66, GRD ’69).
“It is extremely important because, as an educational institution, we are supposed to be preparing the next generation of leaders and well-equipped professionals no matter what arena you go into. More and more there are issues related to peace and security, and it is no longer just left to politicians and government officials,” Alam said.
GIWPS provides research assistant and fellowship program opportunities; it also allocates a small research fund for faculty to encourage those interested in women’s peace and security.
The directors of the institute are accessible to students due to the intimate nature of these programs.
“Because the institute is small and relatively new, it is all very personal. Even with how busy Mayeshais, she has still been able to get me on Ambassador Verveer’s schedule. They have been super helpful to students,” said Student Contributor Jenna Sackler (SFS ’14), who is an Institute for the Study of Diplomacy Humes Fellow.
The institute, which is under the guidance of SFS Dean Carol Lancaster, is steered by a three-person faculty committee: Robert Egnell, the institute’s senior research advisor who is director of teaching and a visiting associate professor in the security studies program, Susan Martin, the director of the Institute of the Study of Migration and Katherine Marshall, an SFS faculty member and senior fellow at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs. Its home within the SFS has allowed it to gain attention on the international stage.
“Georgetown, especially the SFS, is a pretty big name school and it is very visible. The institute helps to bring the issue of women and security to the international stage to Georgetown in a much bigger way than it has before,” Sackler said.
Verveer described the reception the institute has received as positive.
“I would say that it has been particularly gratifying to get more support from multilateral institutions, from upper governments, from government leaders, from people who understand the importance of the issue, and our plea is that we have such a singular focus in the importance for research on these issues, so the receptivity has been particularly encouraging,” Verveer said.
The GIWPS serves the Georgetown community through promoting awareness, research and discussion. It has organized events like “Advancing Afghan Women: Promoting Peace and Progress in Afghanistan,” in which Secretary of State John Kerry, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton spoke.
“The event was a huge statement that the institute is a really big player in the field and a really important source of information for activism and research,” Student Contributor Rachel Firestone (GRD ’15) said.
Since its founding, the institute has upheld its goal to support the role of women in peace and security.
“It has been particularly gratifying to get more support from multilateral institutions, from upper governments, from government leaders, from people who understand the importance of our issue. We are off to a very strong start,” Verveer said.
GIWPS aims to continue serving the Georgetown and global communities in the future.
“We have proven that we are here to serve the Georgetown community but we are bringing added value to the Georgetown community and Georgetown’s outreach to the larger community,” Alamsaid.“We have become a global convening power. We are here to stay but we are also here to be a resource for the wider world, which requires growth, innovation, flexibility and adaptability.”
Verveer spoke on her hopes for the future of the institute.
“I want it to grow in both in recognition and capacity to address the critical issues that is our mission. I would like to see it have both a continuing strong impact for the university, as well as the betterment of the world,” she said. “The ability to have a growing positive impact is something we certainly hope for and well work for.”

The Georgetown Solidarity Committee, in coordination with the United Students Against Sweatshops organization, held an event on Wednesday with survivors of the 2013 RanaPlaza factory collapse in Bangladesh, discussing the struggle for safe workplaces in the wake of deadly factory disasters.
According to USAS International Campaigns Coordinator Garrett Strain, poor conditions in factories are becoming a growing issue because of the competition between factories to produce goods at a lower price.
“It puts factory owners in a position that they are operating on such low margins that there is not even enough money left over to do basic things like make their factory safe for their workers,” Strain said. “No factory owner wants to operate a factory that could burn down or collapse at any minute.”
USAS, founded in 1997, is an independent monitoring organization that investigates working conditions in factories all over the world that produce collegiate apparel. Its goal is to put pressure on factories to improve labor conditions and to pressure universities  not to do business with companies with unhealthy working environments.
Last year, USAS ran a campaign against Adidas after the apparel conglomerate refused to pay $1.8 million in severance pay to disadvantaged workers. The campaign produced the largest collegiate boycott of a major sportswear company in history, after which 17 universities ended their contracts with Adidas, including Georgetown. Adidas came to an agreement in April 2013 to compensate 2,700 former Indonesian garment employees.
“That victory came about because of students like you who made an intentional decision to stand in solidarity with workers on the other end of the supply chain,” Strain said.
The guest speakers at Wednesday’s event, Kalpona Akter and Reba Sikder, have spent years working in Bangladeshi factories.
Sikder, 19, was trapped in the rubble of the Rana Plaza for two days before she was finally rescued. She is now actively involved in organizing efforts to reform Bangladeshi labor practices. Aktertranslated the story on her behalf.
“I started as a domestic worker when I was seven years old,” Sikder said. “When I was 14 years old, I began to work as a factory worker in an attempt to earn more money.”
When Sikder finally found job stability at Rana Plaza, she was paid $90 a month for 110 hours of work per week. Her shifts lasted on average from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. On top of the low pay and long hours, the working conditions at the Rana Plaza were subpar.
“One day, after working two hours, I saw that my coworkers were rushed to leave the factory,” Sikdersaid.  “There was a crack in the building and that’s when they said we should go home now and come back at 2 p.m.”
When they came back to work, managers told the workers that the building was fine and that they should come to work the next morning. The next morning, though, workers were in a dilemma whether they should go inside or not.
“Managers started yelling at them and said ‘Are you afraid to die? Let’s go inside and die together,’”Sikder said. “Then I went to the machine and started my work. When they started the generator, I heard one big sound and everything started collapsing.”
Sikder then remembers regaining consciousness and struggling to find her way around in the darkness. Sikder recounted the screaming and crying of her coworkers from every direction. She found a way out when a coworker felt air from outside.
“Suddenly, one of my coworkers found that there was some air coming from outside,” Sikder said. “We saw someone breaking the wall and rubble and we started screaming and finally he heard our voice.”
Sikder was rescued after two and a half days of being trapped in Rana Plaza. She broke down into tears when she recalled losing many of her coworkers. Sikder has used this traumatic experience as her motivation for fighting against poor working conditions in Bangladesh and abroad.
“I want my compensation and all of the factories to be safe for us,” Sikder said.
Akter is a former child garment worker herself but now serves as an internationally recognized labor rights advocate. She travels from university to university with USAS to spread her  history of factory labor.
“It’s happening because of the huge ignorance from the factory owners, the government, and especially from the companies who let our workers die in these factories,” Akter said.
Akter advocated for the importance of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety, a legal code that has been signed by over 150 apparel corporations from 20 countries in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia.  The accord was drafted in May 2013, following the disaster in Rana Plaza.
“For the first time in history, it is signed by the companies with unions,” Akter said. “That has never happened.”
The accord also states that independent inspectors will look at factories for fire or electrical violations and, after the inspection, the report will be brought to the workers on what needs to be improved. Then the company must pay for the repairs that are listed in the report without docking employee wages to cover the expenses.
As reported in a recent The Hoya article (“GU Protects Bangladesh Workers,” A1, Feb. 7, 2014), Georgetown signed the accord and now requires all trademark licenses that produce products in Bangladesh to abide by the new legal code in order to protect workers.
“The main culprit for these factory disasters in Bangladesh is a company called VF Corporation, which owns Jansport, North Face, Timberland and several other companies,” Strain said. “And if you want to take action and improve working conditions in Bangladesh, you can go to your nearest store to put pressure on the company to take responsibility for safety conditions in Bangladesh.”
In an interview after the event, Akter reemphasized her call to action for Georgetown students.
“We are calling them to look on VF, because they are one of the suppliers for your university so, if they don’t sign the accord, students should raise their voice to the university to cut their contract with them,” Akter said. “Without the accord, it will be the same disaster as Rana Plaza.”

The Peace Corps released a list of the top volunteer-producing colleges and universities Feb. 11, with Georgetown securing the number seven spot of all medium-sized schools. Georgetown’s neighbors, American University and The George Washington University, both placed in the top five, ranked third and fourth, respectively.
According to Peace Corps Acting Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet, the organization ranks institutions based on the number of students a university provides to the Peace Corps and publishes the rankings for multiple reasons.
According to a Peace Corps press release, 27 Georgetown students were accepted as volunteers for the Peace Corps in 2013.
“We’ve been ranking since 2001, and there are many purposes,” Hessler-Radelet said. “The first is to thank those universities that have been such great supporters of Peace Corps over the years and to celebrate their success. Another is to educate the general public about Peace Corps and what a great opportunity it is as a springboard to a career and great preparation for life.”
Hessler-Radelet said she believes that Georgetown’s ranking, although below its peer institutions’, demonstrates the student body’s commitment to service.
“Number seven is a great ranking,” Hessler-Radelet said. “We’d love to see Georgetown move up, and they have throughout the years. … All the schools in the D.C. area are very competitive and very internationally focused, and all are really focused on service, but I believe that Georgetown is a great contender and a fantastic Peace Corps school.”
The Peace Corps recruits Georgetown students each year with a series of events. The most recent event, an information session entitled “Mapping Your Peace Corps Career,” allowed Georgetown students to find out more about their options.
Molly Douglas (SFS ’09), a Peace Corps recruiter, helmed this latest information session and will return to Georgetown for another session in late February.
“It’s an opportunity for them socially for networking, but it’s also an opportunity for outreach to students here on campus to communicate to them the Peace Corps experience and to serve as mentors to students who are interested,” Douglas said.
The Cawley Career Education Center hosts these events each year, according to Manager of Student Resources Gregory Wilson.
“These events are really important for students both to offer them a chance to connect with Peace Corps alumni, but also to answer their questions about the application process,” Wilson said.
Wilson said he could not account for the fact that Georgetown is ranked below American and GW, but said that he is pleased with the fact that Georgetown’s ranking has moved up in the recent years. In the past three years, Georgetown has gone from tenth to seventh place.
“I think that [the rise in rank] speaks to how greatly aligned the mission here at Georgetown is with Peace Corps,” Wilson said. “I think in terms of what students are looking for, students really like Peace Corps because it’s a service organization, and that fits so well into our service-oriented learning here at Georgetown. I feel that so many students are interested in that line of work.”
Hessler-Radelet agrees that the Peace Corps and Georgetown have similar values.
“Georgetown is a great place for [recruitment],” she said. “Your whole ethos is around service, so it’s a natural progression. I would say … Georgetown’s international focus and commitment to service, which is really core to its Jesuit foundation, is really important.”
Douglas, who worked in Albania for two years during her Peace Corps career, attributed her preparation for the Peace Corps to her student experience at Georgetown.
“Georgetown’s approach to the way that they cultivate their students and support them and their mission in the world and engagement with D.C. is all about service,” Douglas said. “I think that service organizations like Peace Corps are a very natural step for a lot of volunteers, not just in checking off a box, but saying that you really do believe this kind of work, want to engage with the world, want to be of service to someone else, challenge yourself and go big or go home.”

Through various campaigns and events, Valentine’s Day marked a special day for campus groups, as several organizations planned fundraising campaigns, selling a range of items from roses to condoms, while others used the day to advocate on behalf of their club.
Candy grams remain a popular tradition, as this year the Georgetown College Democrats sold them as a fundraiser. Students may send the candy grams to a person of their choosing, along with a personalized note.
“We usually just raise money through Semi-Formal, but this semester we have a new department and it is the first of many new fundraisers to come,” GUCD Board Member Sara Margolis (COL ’16) said.
For unofficial clubs, Valentine’s Day marks a great opportunity to receive donations since they do not receive funding from Georgetown. H*yas for Choice, for example, put its own creative twist on the gram tradition by attaching one condom to each.
“It’s important for us to come up with creative and fun ways to generate revenue. … The [grams] have fun things like ‘no glove, no love,’” H*yas for Choice Vice President Abby Grace (SFS ’16) said.
The Campus Life Working Group additionally organized a semi-formal event, HeartBEATS, sponsored by The Corp, WGTB and the Senior Class Committee. Friday’s 9 p.m. event in Copley Formal Lounge will feature five different musical groups from the Georgetown community. Groups will include The Ripples, a student jazz combo, the GU Chamber Quartet, the ladies of Georgetown’s Resonant Essence Live and Atomic Man.
“We wanted to create an event where the diversity of music could be highlighted in one show,” student organizer Brian Moran (COL ’14) said. “This is not a couples’ thing and is not supposed to be exclusive of anyone. … This is a great opportunity to showcase music on campus.”
Some organizations use the holiday to promote their mission and recruit more students to join. Georgetown’s Sexual Assault Peer Educators is hosting SAPE-A-CERTS, where members will hand out free Sprinkles cupcakes and explore healthy sexuality.
GlobeMed planned a Valentine’s Day fundraiser central to their mission, with members selling roses and donating all the profits to Primeros Pasos, a health clinic for women and children in Guatemala. At time of writing, the club was unsure whether the sale would proceed because of the inclement weather.
“GlobeMed might have to cancel the sale because the flowers couldn’t be delivered Thursday,”GlobeMed Co-President Aishling Thurow (NHS ’15) said. “It’s unfortunate because we were slated to raise $500 for Primeros Pasos.”
The Georgetown 1634 Society will also continue their One for Georgetown Campaign throughout Valentine’s Day with a cupcake and rose giveaway. The campaign hopes to encourage philanthropy among young students through fun events centered on professionalism, networking and alumni relations. The ultimate goal of the Valentine’s Day event is to be a presence on campus and encourage students to show their gratitude to both the university and its alumni.
“It’s a symbolic gesture. We want to say that we are grateful,” member Sara Carioscia (COL ’17) said.

Former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-IL) engaged students with a discussion of his lengthy career in Congress as well as the future of bipartisanship in an ideologically divided Congress Tuesday evening in Reiss.
The event, sponsored by the GU College Republicans and the International Relations Club, began after Hastert greeted many in the audience personally. The former speaker detailed his rise in politics from Illinois high school teacher to longest-serving Republican Speaker of the House, from 1999-2007.
“People in politics are just real people. I was a kid in the cornfields, I never expected ever to have a role in government, but I did. Everybody has an opportunity to do it,” Hastert said.
Hastert cited ideological differences between parties as the main source of heated policy battles in today’s government while emphasizing the need for trust and bipartisanship in politics.
“I would tell everybody who came in, whether Democrat or Republican, what the bill was, what the amendment was … I got to know everybody in the Congress, both sides,” Hastert said of his time as Chief Deputy Whip. “And there was this trust that you built up … If you’re not honest with someone, if your word’s not good, in politics trust is everything.”
Hastert spoke at length about immigration reform, about which he expressed regret for being unable to implement during his time as Speaker.
“We need to secure our borders. There’s a lot of drug stuff that has to be secured, but along with that, these people need to have some sort of legitimacy in our society and take a road to citizenship just like everybody else,” Hastert said. “A lot of immigrants are entrepreneurs, business people; they want to come here and improve their life and their economic value for their family. So support for those other diverse groups, too, that we need to bring in the party, and I think what we’ve done is kind of narrow down the party and be exclusionary.”
When asked his views on improving the Republican Party’s prospects for the 2016 presidential election and beyond, Hastert touted the need for inclusivity.
“It has to be a party of inclusion, not exclusion. And so I think we ought to open the doors and bring in as many people as possible, people who have philosophical agreement with us, people who are center-right … ” Hastert said.
Hastert’s informal approach and humble backstory garnered approval from student attendees across the aisle.
“I call myself a Democrat, but that doesn’t mean I’m not open to hearing a Republican …  I come to Georgetown from a very similar place, from a farm community, and to have an opportunity to come to this school and to hear people like him speak is an amazing opportunity,” Tyler Bridge (COL ’17) said.
IRC Deputy Director of Outreach Sam Kleinman (COL ’16), was pleased with the event’s uniqueness.
“The IRC was just so excited to co-host an event with a group we don’t often get to interface with … And it’s incredibly important, not only for the IRC, but for the Georgetown community in general, to engender a wide-ranging discussion for every kind of viewpoint and every kind of opinion on campus, not just the ones we usually hear,” Kleinman said.

A host of familiar on-campus faces will join the confluence of musicians, intellectuals and techies convening in Austin, Texas, for the annual South by Southwest Conference including Georgetown University’s Provost Robert Groves, Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis, and Chief Innovation Officer Z. Michael Wang (MSB ’07).
While the conference is held from March 7-16, Georgetown will participate in a pre-conference panel in March, “Designing the Future University From the Inside.”
The path to this year’s conference started last summer when Wang entered Georgetown’s new tech-education proposal to SXSW’s PanelPicker, which decides which entries will be showcased in the conference in March. After a selection process consisting of both public up-voting of the proposal on PanelPicker and voting by advisory board of educators, administrators and students, Georgetown’s panel was selected to appear at the SXSW conference.
“We had a strong social media push. We were tweeting about it; we had it on Facebook pages, to generate excitement and get people to vote for our proposal,” Davis said.
Wang described the panel’s congruence with the university’s current initiatives.
“Being a staff member I saw we were doing these things — we were doing [Initiative on Technology-Enhanced Learning], we were doing Designing the Future. It was a question of how do we get out there and how to get on a platform where people are talking about this and be seen as the leader that we are,” Wang said.
As past attendees of SXSWedu, a three-day educational conference preceding the larger SXSW event SXSWeduattendees, Wang and Davis have found that Georgetown exceeds its peers in synchronizing technology into education.
“We went to SXSW two years ago and there was a lot of conversations that were not happening about some of the simplest things, like Blackboard,” Wang said. “Over the last years we’ve gone more as observers and the thought was this year to have Georgetown be more of a leader in the space and to share what they’ve done.”
One of the biggest challenges Georgetown will have to address in its panel is how to ensure coursework is designed to account for the rapidly developing knowledge in fields that may render older forms of work obsolete.
“What ‘Designing the Future’ is about is innovating at the degree level so we’re going to experiment with whole new degree programs. Every one of those has some impact on the cost structure of getting that degree,” Groves told The Hoya. “We’re actually anticipating that what you’re learning right now will be obsolete at some point in your life. That’s our burden.”
Georgetown has already incorporated technology like SMART Boards and i>clickers into classrooms and begun to develop massive open online courses like “Globalization’s Winners and Losers: Challenges for Developed and Developing Countries,” which was completed in October 2013 on the edX platform.
Additionally, the university will be holding its second Hackathon SkillHack on Feb. 15, when students, faculty and alumni come together to share ideas about how to design the future of the university, per this year’s initiative.
“The education sector is changing and the goal is to figure out how to adapt with time but also at the same time keep at our core the values of who we are,” Wang said.

Tope Folarin, the Caine Prize Winner for African Writing, read his short story “Miracle” aloud to a packed audience at Copley Formal Lounge on Feb. 11.
Folarin, a Lannan Center Writer-in-Residence, read the entirety of “Miracle,” which details his upbringing as a son of two Nigerian citizens in the United States. This piece explores an experience Folarin had in a Nigerian evangelical church in Texas and highlights his desire for miracles and hope.
“I tried to expose the lies in the interest of truth. The core of the story is that the miracle doesn’t necessarily happen; it just matters that these people leave with hope. They need this miracle to happen. It is absolutely necessary,”Folarin said at the reading.
Folarin will reside at Georgetown for a month to meet with students, visit classes and take an active part in the intellectual life of the university as part of his Caine Prize.
“Folarin is an exciting new voice in American and African writing, bringing an extraordinary attention to craft to bear on challenging questions of identity. We are very privileged to have him with us at Georgetown for a month, as part of the Caine Prize residency,” English professor Coilin Parsons said.
Judges selected “Miracle” from over 100 stories, compared it with four other finalists and then chose it as the winner of the Caine Prize.
Tope used his experiences to speak to the larger immigrant community about identity issues.
“We need our parents to realize that we are American, and we need our children to realize that they are Nigerian,” Folarin said.
Listeners were moved by Folarin’s story.
“I found the presentation excellent. As an immigrant, I really related to the dysphoria he was writing about,” said Jason Park, a student at American University.
Other students were impressed with Folarin’s early success as a writer.
“For an author so young in his literary career, to win such an award and be such a composed reader was very cool,” Danny Falasca (MSB ’16) said.
The highly attended event filled Copley Formal to its capacity.
“He was a very powerful speaker. It was fascinating how his life and African-American roots contributed to his identity as a writer,” Irene Koo (COL ’16) said.
The Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice, which sponsors this event annually, picked Folarinaccording to the Caine jury, which the English department holds a seat on.
“Tope Folarin is not only a very gifted writer, but a talented public reader of his work. The students have been thrilled by their discussions with him and his visits to classes,” Lannan Center Director Carolyn Forche said.
Folarin’s February residence entails classroom visits and meetings with students.
English Professor Nathan Hensley, who delivered Folarin’s introduction, served as one of the five judges on the panel for the 2013 Caine Prize.
“The Caine is supremely important in identifying new talent, and Tope is a brilliant and exciting winner in that respect,” Hensley wrote in an e-mail.

Bright-eyed, budding young scientists and researchers got the rare opportunity to present amateur scientific research to a professional audience when Georgetown played host to the Junior Science and Humanities Symposium Jan. 9 to 10.
Held at the Georgetown University Medical Center, the annual event brings together high school students across the region to present independent research and attend lectures from leading researchers, including those representing the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the Army Research Laboratory.
“This event allows Georgetown to exemplify our commitment to excellence and scholarship and supports our area high school teachers’ efforts to groom future science scholars,” Program Director Joy Williams said.
Now in its 52nd year, the Symposium was the brainchild of Fr. Francis Heyden, S.J., a professor of astronomy and director of the university observatory, who pioneered research in solar eclipses during his time on campus.
“The goal of JSHS is to encourage high school students to prepare for careers in science and research and introduce them to people who are creating new knowledge and love what they are doing,” Williams said.
Extending an invitation to all high schools in the D.C. region, this year’s symposium was attended by 130 students from 26 local schools.
“The tours, seminars and keynote speeches were fascinating and inspirational. The presentations allowed students to be exposed to a variety of different topics and excited us about science,” winner of this year’s $2,000 scholarship Kristi Kan, said.
In April, Kan, a 12th grade student at Centennial High School in Ellicott City, Md., will bring her research project on “The Effects of LED Light Exposure on Strawberry Quality in a Simulated Retail Setting” to the national level of the symposium in D.C., where she will compete for up to $12,000 in undergraduate scholarships. For Kan, however, the regional win has been enough to buoy her interests in food science and nutrition.
“Winning this competition and advancing to the nationals gave me confidence to pursue the sciences further,” Kan said. “Last year in my physics and chemistry classes, I was one of the few girls, and that was a bit intimidating. But winning the Greater Washington JSHS really encouraged me to pursue STEM research further.”
The collaborative nature of the symposium not only gives students an opportunity to interact with leaders in the scientific field, but provides a platform for students to engage professionals in stimulating discussion on some of the largest challenges facing the scientific community.
“It is exciting to bring together students from across the metropolitan area and to encourage their interaction,” Williams said. “The scientists and professors are often inspired by the students’ enthusiasm and encouraged by their commitment which assures some of the unrelenting challenges of today may have solutions tomorrow.”
According to former program director Douglas Eagles, by targeting talented youth, the JSHS has been able to instill a spirit of curiosity and creativity in promising young minds.
“The beauty of this competition and the entire event lies in the innocence of scientific discovery and in catching these kids while they are still curious,” Eagles said.
Beyond intellectual curiosity, participants have the opportunity to be awarded financial scholarships for their showcased research.
“The opportunity for students to submit research projects in competition for the regional scholarships has provided an incentive to area teachers to encourage their students to expend the time and effort required to develop a worthy project,” Williams said. “Seeing and hearing their peers’ presentations has encouraged students to seek research opportunities they might not have considered.”
The competition also provides opportunities for participants to network with peers and professionals alike, with many participants going on to intern for scientific organizations.
“I also met other talented high school students who did amazing research, and I look forward to keeping in touch with them,” Kan said.
For Williams, the competition has provided an invaluable opportunity for GUMC faculty members and scientifically engaged youth to interact.
“My involvement in this program has been immensely rewarding because it keeps me in touch with the excellent science that is being done on this campus and allows me to connect the broader community to our extraordinary faculty,” Williams added.

Door-knocking for the upcoming Georgetown University Student Association will be restricted to weekdays between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m., with the exception of election day, after the GUSA senate passed a recent resolution to restrict door-knocking hours, which was signed by GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) Feb 3.
Any door-knocking outside of the specified hours will be a violation of election campaign rules.
“It shows that GUSA is listening to students,” Tisa said.  “It’s pretty simple and just common sense.”
Senator Cannon Warren (SFS ’14), a former presidential candidate, introduced the bill, which his former running mate, Senator Andrew Logerfo (COL ’14), and Senator Patrick Spagnuolo (SFS ’14) co-sponsored.
The resolution is similar to a past failed bill, in which Warren attempted to pass a campus-wide referendum to prohibit all door-knocking during GUSA Senate and executive elections. The bill, which was introduced in February 2013, failed by a margin of 17 to 3.
“If you ever catch the Senate by surprise or they think you are trying to pull one over on them, they will react very negatively,” Warren said.
“Hopefully, people are going to see how much better their life is,” Warren said referring the recently passed bill. “The people who suffer most from door-knocking aren’t necessarily the people who are having their door knocked upon but the stupid campaign staffers who are somehow roped into knocking on 8,000 doors for a GUSA candidate.”
However, some attribute the large voter turnout in recent student elections, over 50 percent, to door-knocking efforts.
“An outright ban would start taking away from the legitimacy of what GUSA has built up over the past several years,” GUSA presidential candidate and senator Ben Weiss (COL ’15) said. “To entirely ban door-knocking would have been to drastically step back how much GUSA could be able to do for the everyday student.”
The limitation of door-knocking will remove the emphasis from knocking on the most doors possible during campaign season.
“It should actually give the campaigns a breather of their own because now it is guaranteed that only during that four-hour window will people be door-knocking,” Tisa said.
Candidates are hopeful that this resolution will focus the scope of communication between students and candidates.
“I think each year you are starting to see GUSA campaigns that are continuing to innovate and figure out ways to get their message across, which I think is incredibly useful for an informed electorate,” presidential candidate Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said.
As a previous door-knocker and active member in GUSA, Tezel asserted that he can see how other students, with no direct role in GUSA, can find it vexing.
“I was in GUSA, I was interested in a lot of these issues, so it never annoyed me personally, but I could sometimes see how students could be a bit annoyed by the frequency of door-knockers,” Tezelsaid.
Although the regulation of door-knocking will diminish its prominence in campaigning strategy, Tezeldoes not foresee an elimination of door-knocking altogether.
“A lot of people who vote on those bills are the ones who might be needing to utilize that the next time they are running,” Tezel said.  “I think there still is an intrinsic value in having that face-to-face connection with voters.”
While the bill was centered on protecting the privacy and peace of mind of students, some students don’t hold strong feelings about door knocking.
“I don’t have strong feelings on the policy either way,” Scott Syroka (COL ’16) said.  “Plus, life is too short to waste your energy getting angry about someone knocking on your door during campaign season.”
Eamon Johnston (SFS ’17) is witnessing a GUSA campaign for the first time.
“I feel like I might have preconceived notions of the candidates from very limited interaction, so it might be nice to actually talk to them or talk to someone who works with them,” Johnston said.
Although a poll conducted by The Hoya after the GUSA executive election last year indicated that 58 percent of the 793 students polled specified that they disliked door knocking the most out of all campaign methods, Zach Singer (SFS ’15), another presidential candidate, is confident that students want to know about the issues and happenings in GUSA.
“I have personally seen a big change in the way people responded to GUSA my freshman year and the way people respond to GUSA today, which is a positive change I think,” Singer said. “GUSA is becoming more and more relevant, which means the elections have become more relevant.”
Overall, candidates agreed that it is important for students to be informed about candidates and whatGUSA is doing.
“The way that GUSA has worked is that there are roughly three weeks a year, one week during Senate elections and two during the presidential elections, when GUSA tries to go out and let everyone know what we have been doing and what we want to do,” Weiss said.

Seeking to standardize university joint appointments, Provost Robert Groves proposed revised standards to the Joint Appointment Guidelines for Tenure Track Faculty, released Jan. 8. The provost’s revised guidelines were then endorsed by the Executive Faculty.
Georgetown’s joint appointment program began during the 1990s and has grown to the point where approximately 10 percent of the university’s main campus faculty is jointly appointed.
“There was an existing document. It was just a question of having to update it a little bit because the kinds of cases that needed to be dealt with in, say, 1996 were different from the cases in 2013 just because of how interdisciplinary work is increased,” Main Campus Executive Faculty Chair Ian Gale, an economics professor, said.
Before the recent changes, the university’s joint appointments were made in an ad hoc manner. The revised guidelines seek to standardize the appointments by creating three tiers of joint appointments, the lowest of which is called an affiliate status where a faculty member in one unit may teach one course in another or conduct some research, but it remains only a mild, secondary interest.
“The second [tier] is a so-called courtesy appointment which has more defined duties. And the third [tier] is fully shared joint appointment where the salary of the faculty member lies in two different departments. There are agreed-upon duties and rights and responsibilities,” Groves said.
The revisions also clarify payment policy. In particular, the new guidelines standardize how jointly appointed professors are treated when one of the departments that they are a part of supports their tenure, while the other department does not.
“The resolution was that the individual would now be 100 percent in the unit that supported tenure. The question is where does the salary come from and the resolution here was that the amount of the budget would be taken from the one and given to the other,” Gale said.
Professors and administrators praised the joint appointments program as a means for improving the quality of Georgetown’s academics.
A strength of the joint appointments program is that it encourages greater cooperation between departments.
“It works very well. I mean I used to teach at Brown and there were very few joint appointments and the turf battles between various units and centers were pretty vicious, whereas here everyone is kind of sitting on the opposite side of the table in a way and so it actually serves to bind the units together in a very productive way,” joint SFS and government department appointee professor Jeff Anderson said.
The program’s revisions also address one of the primary drawbacks of joint appointments, which arises when professors are overwhelmed by the responsibilities of teaching in multiple units.
“One of the big concerns [is] that people are being stretched too thin, demands are being made on their time because they are in some sense being treated as if they are fully in two different groups. That was one of the things that was also made clear here that there has to be limits on the amount of service that is required [of] people. The amount of service should be proportional to the percentage of your appointment that is in one or the other [department],”  Gale said.
All professors in joint appointment agreements will continue those agreements as before, although possibly under different titles due to their tier level of involvement. Enhanced standardization for future joint appointments is likely to be the largest effect of the revised procedure.
“What has happened is the provost has kind of formalized the system with these new guidelines, but in reality it will have very little or no effect on the existing system of joint appointments,” SFS Acting Dean James Reardon-Anderson said.
Joint appointments are an important part of the plan for the future of Georgetown academics.
“We’re building the future Georgetown, and we think interdisciplinary work is being demanded by the students and the world is presenting us problems that interdisciplinary work can solve, and we want to be right there at the forefront,” Groves said.

Religious policy researcher Jonathan Fox discussed church-state relations and secularization at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs on Tuesday afternoon, highlighting government religious policies across the globe.
The event, titled “Political Secularism, Religion and the State” featured Fox, a professor at Bar-IlanUniversity in Ramat Gan, Israel, who specializes in the influence of religion on politics, domestic conflicts and international relations. Fox is the founder and coordinator of the Religion and State project at Bar-Ilan, which seeks to understand the factors that influence religious policy and how it interacts with other political, social and economic factors.
“I have two goals. One is to provide an accurate description of government religion policies worldwide,” Fox said. “Once I have that information, I look at how it affects other political factors and social factors and economic factors as well as how government religion policy is influenced by them.”
As stated by Fox, the RAS project includes statistics from 177 countries, which is every country in the world with a population greater than 250,000. Fox and his colleagues have collected yearly data for every year between 1990 and 2008, and have documented 151 variables for state-related policy and 154 on religion and constitutions.
“I look at four types of religion policies: official religion policy, the extent to which the government supports religion, the extent to which the government regulates all religions in the country and religious discrimination, which I define as restrictions placed on minority religions that are not placed on the majority religion,” Fox said.
Fox discussed the rise and fall of secularization theory, a pervading early 20th-century academic argument that theorized religion’s eventual decline.
“Academics believed secularization theory because they wanted religion to go away, and they didn’t really check their facts,” Fox said. “Secularization theory predicted religions’ extreme decline, and religion has competition now. I just would not call that secularization.”
Fox’s research directly challenges secularization theory. He reasons that while a quarter of the countries in the world have an official religion, there are a number of countries that do not declare an official one, but rather they have one religion that in all other respects gets treated as official by the state.
“This is not what I would call a secular world. If we had a secular world, you’d expect countries to be a little more neutral. Less than 20 percent of the world’s countries are neutral,” Fox said.
Fox discussed his findings on religious policies from the world’s democracies.
“The breakdown for democracies is very similar to the breakdown for the rest of the world. This is not a breakdown that is driven by non-democracies. Democracies resemble the rest of the world in this respect, except less of them are hostile towards religion,” Fox said.
Vebjorn Horsfjord, a researcher at the Center for Christian-Muslim Understanding at the University of Oslo, discussed the advantages of Fox’s approach to political and religious interconnectedness.
“I think what’s fascinating is to do a quantitative study of these questions and go through every country in the world because that is such a huge job and there are so many questions involved. Hearing somebody who’s actually done it is the most interesting thing,” Horsfjord said. “Because of the diversity of questions it’s so difficult to find variables that make it possible to compare different countries, and I think that shows that this is a very ambitious project.”

German professor Astrid Weigert, Department of Performing Arts Chair Maya Roth and biology professor Gina Wimp received the Dean’s Award for Excellence in Teaching at the Convocation of College Faculty on Jan. 23.
In order to be considered for the award, a professor must be nominated by their department, with a letter of nomination from the department chair and two colleagues’ recommendation letters. The professor must also draft a statement of teaching philosophy.
In the final decision, the teacher’s syllabi and past student evaluations are also considered.
“Before electronic student evaluations, you had to say how many students were in each course, how many actually filled out the application and how many didn’t. It’s a good chunk of work,” Weigert said. After being nominated several times, she considered declining this year’s nomination because of the amount of work entailed.
This year’s professors have each taught at Georgetown for at least six years and developed their own courses in their respective fields.
Roth is one of five faculty-in-residence on campus, living in LXR. Roth became a faculty-in-residence in 2008 when she had a son and, as it enabled her to continue some of her work more easily.
“I don’t know how I could have been a mother and be in rehearsals at night times without being a faculty-in-residence,” Roth said. “It also made my experience more integrated, allowed me to interact with a much wider range of students and gave me a better pulse on what students’ experiences are and that has shaped how I structure my courses.”
Roth began teaching at Georgetown in 2003 and served as the founding Artistic Director of the Davis Performing Arts Center from 2005 to 2007. She has developed 14 different courses and directed 10 original shows, in addition to her role in opening the Davis Performing Arts Center. In her position as department chair, she shaped the theater and performance studies major to emphasize artistic excellence and the liberal arts. Of 54 total recipients in the award’s history, she is only the fourth performing arts professor to be recognized.
“I’m moved, proud, honored by the folks who are going into other fields and other traditional graduate jobs, for whom [a performing arts class] was central to their formation. To have them affirm that was really meaningful,” Roth said.
Wimp played an integral part in designing the environmental biology major, and she helped to develop two new courses, “Ecological Analysis” and “Global Climate Change Ecology.”
Wimp additionally researches genetic and environmental factors that structure biodiversity, all while teaching.
“The time allocation process can be incredibly difficult, but I’ve learned you have to use every single time slot as you can as efficiently as possible,” Wimp said.
Despite Wimp’s many commitments, her favorite part of her profession remains her interactions with students.
“Really students are the best part of my job. You do feel a sense of elation when you get your papers published or a grant funded, but there’s something different about actually watching somebody grow up as a scientist and watching them succeed,” Wimp said.
Weigert has developed classes about German business culture, Romanticism and German-speaking countries.
“I really would like to dedicate this award to my entire department because my development as a teacher really didn’t happen in isolation,” Weigert said. “We have a very collaborative process here and that really allowed me to try out different things, to develop, to consult my colleagues. I think that’s incredibly valued here.”

Pakistani Ambassador Jalil Abbas Jilani discussed the turbulent political and economic relations between the United States and Pakistan in McGhee Library on Tuesday.
The School of Foreign Service Asian Studies Program organized the event as part of the Lunch with an Ambassador Series, which was designed to give Georgetown students, alumni and professors the opportunity to learn about current affairs from the international figures who are actively participating in world-changing policymaking.
The fully-booked event created an opportunity for conversation about the tense relations between the two countries since 2011, when Osama bin Laden was killed in a secret U.S. military operation in Pakistan.
“The years 2011 and 2012 also witnessed a low in U.S.-Pakistan relations. … They suffered a great deal,” Jilani said.
Although Pakistan is a U.S. ally regarding the “war on terror,” Americans and Europeans accused Pakistan’s military and security forces of protecting bin Laden from U.S. intelligence agents. The Pakistani government categorically denied these accusations, but the ramifications of this event as well as continued drone strikes targeting al-Qaida in the northern tribal areas have heightened tensions between the nations’ political leaders.
Despite this contention, the ambassador remained optimistic about current and future relations between the two nations, arguing that current cooperation bodes well for the future.
“The current level of engagement we have in both countries gives every reason for both sides to be satisfied with the level of cooperation that is going on not only on the economic front, but also on trade, counter terrorism, intelligence, military to military cooperation,” Jilani said. “Also I think at the level of the parliament of Pakistan and the U.S. Congress have good cooperation and good understanding about the interaction that is going on.”
The ambassador focused on Pakistan’s energy crisis, defense and counter-terrorism operations and economic and trade issues.
“On the economic front, the situation looks very good. The GDP has seen a significant growth in the last six months, the fiscal deficit has been reduced, the GDP has been increased, the government has also been able to pay back the circular debt in a matter of one month almost $5 million, which has increased the productivity of various projects, which resulted in industrial growth,” Jilani said.
However, the country cannot achieve its potential without the support of world powers with already-prominent economies like the United States. He stressed that America’s investment in Pakistan’s economy could reap benefits in Afghanistan — a country of primary U.S. interest. The economies of Afghanistan and Pakistan are very closely linked since they engage in more than $2 billion worth of trade.
“A sound economic base in Pakistan would also have a very positive effect on the economy of Afghanistan, and in turn would bring about stability, which has been the long term objective of the United States and other countries involved in Afghanistan,” Jilani said.
The ambassador also spoke about Pakistan’s strained relations with India, which resulted from territorial disputes over the region of Kashmir.
“Just as India has its issues related to terrorism, we also have our concerns to terrorism as far as India is concerned,” Jilani said.
However, Jilani is aware that establishing strong relations with Pakistan’s neighbors is a crucial step toward prosperity and success.
“The Prime Minister is convinced that unless there is peace and stability in the region, the economy certainly will not gain the same kind of momentum that the government wants,” he said. “With that the government has taken a number of initiatives with Afghanistan and India in order to improve our relations and also in order to improve the overall security.”
This outlook seemed rather optimistic to Stanley Kober (SFS ’73), who attended  Tuesday’s lunch.
“He’s being very diplomatic. … I’m not so sure about the economy and the terrorism,” he said.
During the latter half of the event, which was open to questions, several queries centered on the region’s military state of affairs. Despite concerns about Pakistan’s involvement with bin Laden, the ambassador stated that the two countries are currently cooperating on intelligence operations.
The ambassador concluded the event by reflecting upon his goals as ambassador to the United States. He hopes to build a very strong relationship between the two countries. Professor Christine Fair, whose research concerns political and military affairs in South Asia, found Jilani’s remarks trite: She felt that he avoided the accusations that were levied against his country.
“Personally, I found the Ambassador’s talk to be a staged rehearsal of well-worn talking points and it included a regrettable amount of dissembling on key issues such as Pakistan’s support for  Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Taliban and so forth,” Fair wrote in an email. “It was clear from his talk that the talking points of the civilian government and the Pakistan military and intelligence agencies are isomorphic, unfortunately.”

The Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies held an event featuring Dr. Regine A. Spector, assistant professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, entitled “Protecting Property without Rights: Bazaars and the Emergence of a Familial State in Kyrgyzstan” in Riggs Library on Thursday.
The lecture focused on the development of property rights and economic development through the eyes of the traders and owners of these various bazaars – or marketplaces – in Kyrgyzstan’s major cities including the capital city ofBishkek.
Spector began by dispelling the notion that the region’s major trading centers are still those that originated along the Silk Road in countries such as Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
“While the bazaars that thrived in cities such as Samarkandand Bukhara — bazaars that still exist today — the biggest bazaars in Central Asia are now located in Kyrgyzstan. After the first decade of independence Kyrgyzstan has earned a reputation as a trading state and as a country of traders,” Spector said.
Spector also examined the political and economic development of the nation since its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and the country’s transition to an open parliamentary democratic system after the 2010 removal of authoritarian President Kurmanbek Bakiyev.
Spector analyzed these developments through the eyes of the owners of these many bazaars — who are often well-connected members of the Kyrgyz political elite — as a way to understand their role in the economic and social issues that plagued so-called “predatory” states that lack stable rule-of-law institutions.
“If you take the 10 richest people in Kyrgyzstan’s parliament in 2008, you will find that five of them are bazaar owners. The active engagement in politics is considered crucial to maintaining their positions of power in society,” Spector said.
In the question and answer session that followed, Spector addressed questions from the audience of around 30 people, mostly academics with a particular interest in the field of Central Asian studies.
Dr. Angela Stent, Director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies, inquired about the current debate over Kyrgyzstan joining a customs union with Kazakhstan and Belarus led by Russia, a move that has sparked mass protests from many workers who say the agreement would result in higher tariffs.
“Over time, I would suggest that various political analysts and business interests have come to realize that Kyrgyz tariffs are very low, and that joining the customs union would in fact raise those tariffs. For a re-export sector, those tariffs are very damaging, and that re-export sector is the bazaars,” Spectorsaid.
Anne Johnson (GRD ’15), a student in the Global Human Development Program, asked about the role of women in these bazaars, and how their involvement shapes their role in these new political systems.
“The folks that you mentioned in the management positions seem to be mostly men, but women are also very active in bazaar culture,” Johnson said, “What about their role in these property negotiations and political maneuverings?”
Spector maintained that while men do primarily occupy these ownership roles in the bazaar system, there is a trend towards women taking larger roles in the day-to-day business operations in some circumstances.
“It is true that most of the owners are men, however women do play important roles at that level because often times the women are formally the owners of businesses since the husband is often a member of parliament or is in a political position where he is not allowed to have a business,” Spectorsaid.
According to Stent, the Nava’i-Nalle series is meant to foster academic interest in Central Asian affairs, especially to encourage the work of younger scholars entering this field of study.

Financial literacy program Common Sense held a conversation Thursday in the Reiss Science Building with Georgetown University Chief Benefits Officer CharlesDeSantis, in which he highlighted the importance of considering health, retirement and other benefits when applying for jobs.
DeSantis previously worked in the banking industry before assuming his current position at Georgetown, and has been involved in developing an art immersion program for children living in the Kenyan slum Kibera.
DeSantis called health care a basic benefit.
“The minute you don’t have [health insurance] and something happens, it doesn’t matter how much or how little you make,” he said. He added that it is an epiphany for a lot of people to realize that their insurance co-pay does not actually cover the medical services they require.
DeSantis also discussed the importance of defined contribution retirement plans like 401(k)s or 403(b)s, in which companies match money put in by individuals.
“It’s important to put away. You start doing it once and then you never think about it,” he said of companies that don’t offer retirement plants, “They’re not contributing to your future.”
DeSantis characterized dental insurance as the most non-aggressive and unsupported benefit in the marketplace.
“Really what you’re doing when you’re buying dental care is buying a discount. Discounts are negotiated based on the plan,” he said. He added that benefits like company cars, gym memberships and day care can also make a big different to a person’s financial picture.
DeSantis ended with an emphasis on the importance of considering benefits, not just salary, when evaluating a job offer.
“I hate that we all pursue jobs for money only,” he said. “I really want people to pay attention to what they’re doing.”
Students enjoyed the event.
“He put a very personable spin on benefits that I never really thought of. I will take away from the event that it’s not just all about the pay while you’re at a job; it’s also about the benefits of the job and the accommodations offered to ensure my well-being,” Omorinsola Ajayi (NHS ’16) said.
Others agreed.
“I don’t really know much about benefits; like, it’s not a conversation I have much with my parents. I think it’s important that I learn about what I’m entitled to as someone who’s going to be a college graduate,” Queen Adesuyi (COL ’16) said.
Some students were already familiar with the information shared.
“While I knew most of the information that Mr. DeSantis presented, I enjoyed the review because it is all valuable information to keep in mind when in the job search,” Alexandra Buck (COL’14) said. “I also enjoyed his ‘bi-line’ of following your passions, not just the money.”

As snow blanketed Georgetown on Wednesday night, candidates for the 2014 Georgetown University Student Association executive election and their respective staffs waited in Red Square for the clock to strike 12, signaling the official beginning of the campaign season.
While around 30 candidates, campaign staffers and onlookers were present in Red Square on Wednesday, each team experienced difficulty taping their banners to the brick walls of the archway because of the cold and the effects of precipitation.
After 11 minutes, all parties agreed to give up and try again the next day.
Candidates for the 2014 election have been unofficially known to the public for several days, as the GUSA Election Commission mandates attendance at information sessions for all prospective candidates.
However, Feb. 13 marked the official commencement of the campaign period, during which candidates and staffers are allowed to knock on doors, table in Red Square, hang advertisements, speak to the media and hold other promotional events. The election itself will be held online Feb. 27.
Supporters of Ben Weiss (COL ’15) and Sam Greco (SFS ’15) arrived in Red Square well before midnight, claiming a spot on the Intercultural Center wall facing outward into Red Square for their promotional materials. Around 10 campaign staffers came to assist with the process, including prominent College Republicansmembers such as chair Patrick Musgrave (COL ’16). Although Weiss is an active Democrat, Greco has extensive experience with the College Republicans.
Weiss noted that although the snow was making the first night of campaigning difficult, he was optimistic for his team’s prospects in the contest.
“We’re going to try and proceed as usual,” Weiss said. “We’ve got a great team of seasoned campaigners, so we know exactly what needs to be done.”
Dan Silkman (COL ’15), who is running for vice president alongside presidential hopeful Zach Singer (SFS ’15), also arrived well before midnight to stake out a spot in Red Square.
“It’s been so far, so good, but I guess we got here much earlier than necessary,” Silkman said. Singer was not present at the kickoff, as he was attending a campaign event in Alumni Square.
GUSA election procedure stipulates that campaign teams are to have no direct interaction with the media prior to 12 a.m. Thursday. However, Singer and Silkman’s campaign manager, Megan Murday (SFS ’15), released a media packet, embargoed until midnight, to campus press organizations at 11:02 p.m. Wednesday night. The packet described the candidates’ backgrounds, positions on key issues and budgetary proposal.
Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) and Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15), running for president and vice president, respectively, were both present in Red Square. Ramirez noted the difficulties his team, as well as all of those present during the snowstorm, were facing trying to hang their signs.
“It looks like we’re going to have to play it by ear and hopefully not get snowed in,” Ramirez said.
Although Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) were not present in Red Square to the walkway leading to the Leavey Center, opposite where the Singer-Silkman and Lloyd-Ramirez teams were attempting to hang theirs. Many of these individuals were members of the College Democrats, for which Tezel served as president, including Joe Laposata (COL ’16) and Bethan Saunders (SFS ’17). KC Crewdson (SFS ’15), an events coordinator for the Tezel-Jikaria campaign, had offered the use of the team’s ladder to any team that needed it at the start of the night.
“I think this is hysterical,” Weiss said, after the truce was called. “Honestly, campaigning is so much fun, crazy stuff happens and I’m sure this won’t be the last thing like this.”
Silkman felt confident that his staff would complete the task once the weather allowed it.
“It’s unfortunate, but we’ll give it another stab at it tomorrow, whenever the snow stops or it gets warmer,” Silkman said.
Although they could not make it to Red Square, Tezel and Jikaria have been planning different types of advertising, including setting up a table on the second floor of Lauinger Library, knocking on doors and posting flyers inside buildings, as is common for GUSA candidates.
“I’m really excited for it to get going,” Tezel said. “It was a whirlwind of activity right at midnight, and that carried over into today.”
By Thursday evening, after the snow had turned to a light rain, all four teams had managed to hang their banners.

After extensive petitioning from the Georgetown University Student Association, the university has officially added an alcohol amnesty clause in cases of sexual assault to the Code of Student Conduct to reduce barriers to reporting sexual assault on campus.
“The Disciplinary Review Committee  recently revised the Student Code of Conduct in response to community concerns that the potential for adjudication for underage possession or consumption of alcohol might prevent students from reporting alleged sexual assault or misconduct,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said.
The alteration means that, in cases of sexual assault or misconduct, neither the complainant nor the respondent will be charged with alcohol-related violations. Although the policy was in place in practice, its formal addition to the code of conduct is notable.
“The university was typically practicing this type of thing already, but because it wasn’t in the code [of conduct] itself, and because it wasn’t advertised as widely as it will be now, we’re really hoping that this is a moment where we can tell all students that if you know someone this has happened to or if this has happened to you, you can report it and you can say you were drinking, but it won’t come back on you,” GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson reviewed and approved the GUSA proposal, which was then studied by the university’s legal department. The policy received support from students, as it creates a safe reporting environment for survivors.
“A lot of people were advocating for this policy … we want survivors of sexual assault to feel asconfortable as possible in a reporting position,” Student Advocacy Office Co-Director Ben Manzione(SFS ’15) said. “When a survivor has gone through a trauma, they need as much support as they can get. They shouldn’t feel like the fact that they were potentially under the influence of alcohol should be a barrier for reporting [the incident].”
Alcohol is involved in at least half of sexual violence cases each year in the United States and even more frequently on college campuses. The National Institute of Justice estimates that a fifth to a quarter of female students experience rape or attempted rape over the course of their college careers.
“When alcohol is used to facilitate an assault, it can make it difficult for survivors to come forward, especially if it is believed they will get in trouble due to their use of alcohol,” Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Services Coordinator Jen Schweer said. “Removing this as a possibility means there could be more who feel comfortable reporting what happened to them.”
At Georgetown, sexual misconduct and sexual assault violations are viewed as an offense by the Division of Student Affairs and Office of Student Conduct as well as a breach of District law, resulting in charges and potential prosecution in District courts and disciplinary action at Georgetown, including the potential for suspension or expulsion.
Through initiatives like RU Ready, Take Back the Night and Sexual Assault Peer Educators, Georgetown is attempting to foster a community that engages in dialogue around sexual violence.
“The more we can talk about it … the more we are able to create a survivor-centered community where students feel comfortable coming forward and accessing resources,” Schweer said.

IAN TICE/THE HOYAOnce called America’s Chocolate City, D.C. has lost some of that distinction over the past decade with the advent of gentrification across many of the city’s wards. Sheryll Cashin and Paul Butler, two professors of law specializing in the area of race relations at the Georgetown University Law Center, opine on the state of race in the District.
A Reversed White Flight?
Beginning with the “white flight” to the suburbs of D.C. after World War II, the District has been a predominantly black city, boasting a 70 percent black majority by 1970. However, the past two decades have witnessed a reversed white flight as wealthy white residents move into historically black neighborhoods, such as Brookland in Ward 5 and Petworth in Ward 4. As of 2012, the city’s black majority had diminished to 50.1 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
“I think gentrification is responsible for forcing many low-income Americans out of the city,” Butler said.
From 1990 to 2010, the average black population per ward decreased from 65 percent to 51 percent. This average, however, is computed from extremes in three of the city’s eight wards: Wards 7 and 8 have 95 percent and 94 percent black populations as of 2010, and Ward 2, which contains Georgetown, has a black population of just 9.8 percent.
The lack of affordable housing options in downtown D.C. has sent many lower-income residents across the Anacostia River to Wards 7 and 8 in search of less expensive housing, creating not only a geographic, but also racial and economic divide.
“I think there are a lot of neighborhoods east of the river that feel left out of the city’s bloom times, and there is a racial dimension to that, as those communities who are left out are almost exclusively African-American communities,” Butler said.
Cashin, author of the forthcoming book “Place, Not Race,” credited this polarization across wards to a recent rise in high-income development in downtown D.C.
“I think what’s happening in the District is that higher-income people are pricing out lower-income people, and it may have racial implications,” Cashin said. “People of color, on average, have less money than whites do, but that’s what’s happening. It’s getting more expensive to live in the District.”
Increasing Diversity in the District
The growth of the white population, Cashin noted, is a trend unique to the District, as white populations across the country continue to lose their majority status.
“The white people are experiencing a loss of majority status and it isn’t happening everywhere, but a lot of places, and white people have to adjust to that reality. Everybody has to adjust to that reality. In the future, nobody’s going to be the dominant group,” Cashin said.
“[Black people] experienced a loss of political dominance and maybe even cultural dominance. [D.C. is] no longer the Chocolate City; it’s the multiracial city, and black people have had to adjust. But the same thing is happening nationally,” Cashin said.
According to Cashin, with increasing levels of diversity, the District has emerged as a culturally vibrant location with an environment of tangible inclusivity.
“The city is more livable than it used to be, and it’s an exciting, multiracial, I would even say international, place, where a lot of people of all different types come, and there are people who are attracted to it because of that vibrancy and diversity,” Cashin said.
Institutional Polarization
This diversity, however, has yet to manifest itself in institutions such as the D.C. Court System or D.C. Public Schools.
“If you go to criminal court in D.C., you would think that white people don’t commit crimes … and we know that for drugs, for example, white residents of D.C. use drugs just as much as the black and Latino residents, so there’s clearly inequality in law enforcement for those kinds of crimes, and that’s a concern,” Butler said.
According to Butler, the high rates of black drug offenders could be due to a higher number of police deployed in predominantly black neighborhoods.
“If the police increased their drug law enforcement in Georgetown or Foggy Bottom or Cleveland Park, then there’d be more white drug offenders who are locked up, so there are racial dimensions to where the police enforce the drug laws,” Butler said.
Georgetown students who tutor in Wards 7 and 8 see that the D.C. Public School System exhibits similar levels of racial polarity across wards.
“I have never seen a student that was not African-American in the schools I’ve worked in,” D.C. Reads Coordinator Emilie Uhrhammer (SFS ’16) said.
Mellie Corrigan (COL’14), who has been a tutor and coordinator for D.C. Reads for four years, agreed.
“It’s always been predominantly black,” Corrigan said.
Moving Forward
Cashin stressed the need for more affordable housing to be built in the city in order to promote greater racial inclusivity.
“We have some policies in place that are designed to retain the affordable housing stock, but my fear is that the city is becoming more like Paris where, in Paris, lower-income people and communities of color can live out in the suburbs,” she said.
Cashin cited the District’s inclusionary zoning ordinance, a requirement that all new residential developments set aside a certain percentage of their units for affordable, lower income housing, as one way to increase the city’s diversity by ensuring that less wealthy families are afforded the same opportunity to live in the District as higher-income individuals.
“It’s weak. It’s not as robust as it could be,” Cashin said.
Butler agreed that the D.C. should prioritize lower-income housing to maintain its current levels of diversity.
“I always think it’s a problem when cities lose their diversity, including racial diversity, and class diversity, so I think the city should make a black warranty of establishing low-income quality housing,” Butler said.
Nevertheless, Cashin is hopeful that the District’s increasingly multiethnic identity will work to inform the diversity of its institutions.
“I do think that where the District is going with this can be a positive story and there are very positive aspects to it, but we have to have the right policies in place for making our neighborhoods and our institutions inclusive in the way that works for everybody,” Cashin said.

Following the official beginning of the Georgetown University Student Association executive election campaign period at midnight Thursday, the four tickets each released platforms illustrating priorities they would pursue if elected. The presidential candidates will meet in a debate Feb. 23 while the vice presidential candidates will face off on a yet undetermined date between Feb. 18 and 20. The election takes place online Feb 27.
Thomas & Jimmy: Together With Georgetown
Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) and Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15), seek to guide their campaign by adhering to their motto, “Empower Hoyas to build vibrant communities by using innovative tools.”
In order to accomplish this empowerment, Lloyd and Ramirez suggest adopting more liberal open container and medical amnesty policies, expanding the role of the Student Advocacy Office in the judicial process and increasing opportunities for undergraduate research and cross-disciplinary study.
“Vibrant communities” refers to the promotion of free speech rights, increasing space for artistic pursuits, the refurbishment of spaces such as Kehoe Field and initiatives designed to promote diversity in student leadership.
Lastly, “innovative tools,” includes a housing points bonus to incentivize student participation in student group-run events, as well as technology and sustainability initiatives.
Lloyd emphasized the importance of cultivating an inclusive, welcoming community that fosters diversity andinterorganizational cooperation, and how he plans to use incentives to achieve this goal.
“The idea of community is particularly important to Jimmy and I as people who worked to increase diversity in different organizations,” Lloyd said. “In the GUSAexecutive, we would want to actually cut the budget of theGUSA Fund to establish incentives for groups to collaborate, so that money is earmarked specifically for programs that deal with collaboration, diversity or safety.”
 
Zach & Dan: Building Your Georgetown
Zach Singer (SFS ’15) and Dan Silkman’s (COL ’15) platform promotes a three-pronged approach to addressing student life at Georgetown. It stresses collaboration between different student groups, particularly through the “What’s a Hoya?” program and GUSA support of previously unrecognized groups on campus. Additionally, the team seeks to further pluralism at Georgetown through the creation of a leadership fund, which would help students overcome financial burdens, as well as through initiatives designed to enhance the experience of sophomores and transfer students.
The platform additionally includes sustainability, quality student housing in the former Jesuit residence buildings and a fair judiciary process for students as central tenets of its vision for Georgetown’s future.
According to Silkman, the proposed Leadership Fund is a particularly unique and valuable means of promoting opportunities for financially constrained students.
“We talk about the financial barriers that exist at Georgetown, and we mention the establishment of a leadership fund,” Silkman said. “It will consist of money earmarked in our budget for student leaders on campus who are looking to run for positions that may or may not require financial contributions beyond the candidate’s means.”
Singer described his campaign’s larger theme as a mediator between the student body and the university administration.
“On a lot of the issues, we ask what GUSA can do to address the problem, and what can we do with the administration and how can we convey the needs of the students to the administration,” Singer said.
 
Trevor & Omika: Connect to Georgetown
Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Omika Jikaria’s (SFS ’15) platform is divided into three sections, entitled “connecting to your values,” “connecting to your community” and “connecting to your world.”
The “values” portion deals with issues relating to promoting and expanding free speech, student rights, transparency within GUSA and intercultural understanding on campus. The “community” section addresses the lack of space for the arts on campus, the necessity of renovating Kehoe field and the promotion of entrepreneurship and improvements in campus club funding, among other issues.
The “world” segment advocates the improvement of relations with the larger D.C. community, the implementation of sustainability projects on campus and the adoption of technology designed to improve student life.
Tezel views GUSA’s role as facilitator and advocate for student rights as one of the most important points of his ticket’s platform.
“We want to connect students to both GUSA and the administration, through things like the multicultural council and holding office hours for GUSA,” Tezel said. “We also want to shore up the code of conduct processes for handling sexual assaults, as well as looking at some of the social polices.”
Jikaria additionally noted the platform’s emphasis on the promotion of free speech on campus. “Our goal would be to create a campus-wide free speech zone,” Jikaria said. “We want to extend the current free-speech zone and allow for more dialogue.”
Jikaria cited the recent removal of H*yas for Choice from Healy Circle by the Georgetown University Police Department as a restriction she and Tezel would seek to protest if elected.
 
Ben & Sam: Working for You
Ben Weiss (COL ’15) and Sam Greco’s (SFS ’15) campaign focuses largely on eliminating obstacles to student achievement and improving the quality of student life. One of the platform’s five subsections,“#AchieveYours,” stresses the creation of an inclusive campus community dedicated to promoting student growth.
Another section,“Cultivating Student Potential,” advocates a club-first funding approach and the creation of a Central Programming Board to better coordinate large events. Additionally, “A Better Campus,” stresses more green space, food options and study areas, and “Unity, Community and Service” advocates an increased emphasis on pluralism, freshman community-building and the prospect of allowing freshmen to drink in dorm rooms.
The fifth section, “Academics,” addresses the need for standardization of midterm exam timing and more credit opportunities for internships.
Weiss described his ticket’s platform as seeking to drastically alter the role GUSA plays in university life.
“It’s a fundamentally different vision for GUSA. My vision is to help the students of Georgetown achieve their goals,” Weiss said. “I want GUSA to be the facilitator of all of the different passions and initiatives and goals of this incredible student body that we have.”
Weiss additionally mentioned his student-first funding initiative and focus on entrepreneurship as two factors that particularly differentiate his ticket from the others.
“Everyone has different ideas on things that already exist, but I think these speak to this vision of students and student organizations first,” Weiss said.

This week’s snowstorm delayed approximately half of the high school delegations set to arrive at the 51st North American Invitational Model United Nations conference, which runs from Feb. 13-16 and is held and staffed by the Georgetown International Relations Association.
With over 150 high schools attending the conference, many faced trouble in arriving in time for Thursday’s 7:30 p.m. opening ceremony and 9:00 p.m. committee session.
Georgetown staffers additionally faced trouble arriving to the conference, held at the Washington Hilton in DupontCircle, as both the Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle and public transportation did not run.
The NAIMUN LI team began to anticipate the effects of the forecasted weather and contacted the team that led NAIMUN during the 2010 “Snowpocalypse.”
“They said first of all that we should inform our staff and make sure that we’re prepared to be able to run committees if we have fewer people there, especially for the Thursday session. The other thing was to send out a letter to the moderators and students to make safe travel arrangements as alternatives to whatever they had planned as necessary,” Executive Director Sarah Pemberton (SFS’15) said.
The 2010 conference took place during a weekend that saw 18-32 inches of snow.
“NAIMUN has happened for 51 years and it hasn’t been cancelled yet. Actually, ‘Snowpocalypse’ in 2010, basically all airports were shut down for almost a week. Georgetown staffers walked all the way from the front gates to Dupont Circle to make the conference happen, and if that’s the kind of dedication our staff has had in the past, I see no reason why this year we can’t make things work,”NAIMUN LI Secretary-General Pavan Rajgopal (SFS ’15) said. “We have to adapt and it will be challenging, but at the end of the day, the snow won’t stop us.”
In order to help staff members arrive safely, NAIMUN staffers are offered $5 subsidies for cab rides, among other support and planning.
“We’re still working on trying to arrange it with staff to make sure that we can send people out in groups and make sure that it’s not too much of an expense for staff, but we’re still working out the kinks and making sure that staff can safely arrive and arrive on time before the first committee session,” Pemberton said.
Many members resorted to taking taxis or Uber to arrive at the Washington Hilton.
“My original idea was to walk, but I walked to Wisconsin and I started walking down to Q [Street] and the snow was up to my ankles and it was sleeting out, so I took a cab,” NAIMUN staffer Jason Petty (SFS ’17) said.
Besides the snowfall in D.C. itself, the weather patterns affect the origin cities of the delegates, as it started in the South, hit the D.C. area and then travelled to the tri-state area, from where many of the delegations hail.
“It’s really the perfect storm, pardon the pun,” Rajgopal said.
However, late arrival for NAIMUN delegates poses difficulties, as late delegates will cause committees to be nearly empty.
In relation to assessment of delegates and awards, late delegates will not be penalized.
“We’ve instructed our chairs and crisis managers to take appropriate measures to make sure that no delegate is put at a disadvantage because of the time that he or she arrives,” Rajgopal said. “Obviously, the weather is something that’s outside of their control and they shouldn’t be penalized for that, so we’re taking the appropriate measures to make sure that everyone is on a level playing field on Friday afternoon.”
Pemberton said that the staff was well-equipped to deal with the twist in weather fortunes.
“One of the benefits of having such a large travelling team, as well, is because a lot of us have had to face similar circumstances in terms of arriving at the conference so I think our staff is aware of how we can make it easier for delegates to transition late into the committee,” Pemberton said.
Staffers remain unfazed and confident in the success of the rest of the conference.
“Considering all of the planning that had to go into the conference as a whole, I think that [the weather] is not as big of a factor as compared to the other things,” Petty said. “I don’t think it will be as big a deal as it could be just based on how much they put into alternative planning and coming up with contingency plans.”

While student political attention is currently focused on Georgetown University Student Association elections, D.C. mayoral candidates competing in the April 1 Democratic primary are trying just as hard to engage young voters.
In formal and informal debates since the Jan. 1 deadline to enroll in the primary, candidates have discussed government transparency, transportation and job creation as three areas that will affect the lives of college students and recent graduates in the District.
In the 2012 presidential election, voters aged 18 to 29 made up 19 percent of the vote, according to Politico, and the youth vote is even more essential in the District.
Candidates, including incumbent Mayor Vincent Gray, are pushing their own visions for the transformation of D.C. into what many call a “world-class city” among the ranks of New York or London.
“Economic development is continuing across this city, along with our investments in affordable housing and infrastructure. I think everyone in this race would agree we’re better off than we were four years ago,” Gray said at a mayoral debate last month.
With just over 30 percent of District residents between the ages of 18 and 34 — a percentage that is on the rise as D.C. continues to attract young professionals to technological and startup industries — the youth vote will be crucial to the April primary and general election Nov. 4.
Candidates challenging Gray say that access to those opportunities, while plentiful, will hinge on how the local government chooses to include young people in the political process.
“Cities are the energy hubs for new jobs, new opportunities, and it’s very likely that most college graduates are going to participate in that development here in D.C. If you either work, live or play in cities, how they’re governed has a huge impact on the type of place they become,” Councilman Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) told The Hoya.
This influx of young professionals, however, must be met with adjustments from the local government to incorporate these new individuals into the local workforce.
“We’re expecting 200,000 more residents by 2040, and we’ve got to make sure we’ve got a mayor who understands how to make sure the city is ready for it from a budgetary standpoint, from a jobs standpoint and from an infrastructure standpoint,” said Bo Shuff, campaign manager for Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4).
Former State Department official Reta Jo Lewis was quick to point to her experience in local government and continued focus on issues that affect young people — including access to healthcare — as reasons why she is the right person to lead the District.
“I’ve fought for issues all my life that matter to students — good-paying jobs, access to healthcare and health services and equality and inclusion for all people — and throughout my career, I have always had students and young professionals involved in the work that I do,” Lewis said.
With the current Democratic primary shadowed by an ongoing ethics investigation into campaign finance violations during Gray’s 2010 campaign, Gray’s challengers have been quick to point to the need for a leader that young people can trust.
“I think young people are tired of business as usual. They’re tired of seeing politics as a tainted game with money scandals always constantly hovering over the city,” candidate and local restaurateur Andy Shallal said.
Shuff touted Bowser’s role in creating a Board of Ethics and Government Accountability in November 2011 to hold city officials responsible if found guilty on corruption charges or other ethics violations.
“Muriel introduced, passed and then enacted the bill that created the Board of Ethics. She saw what many younger people saw over the last seven years on the council with their behavior and decided she was going to do something about it,” Shuff said.
Improvement of the District’s transportation system is another platform that candidates think appeals specifically to young voters. Wells emphasized his push for a streetcar that would connect Georgetown to the rest of the city.
“The current candidates for mayor voted to end the streetcar for D.C.; I saved it. Running a streetcar to Georgetown and all the way down to the east side of the city really is a way to connect Georgetown and the university to the rest of the city,” Wells said.
Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), whose area of representation includes the university, noted that he would use his position as mayor to move forward plans for a Metro stop in the Georgetown neighborhood.
“Georgetown needs to have a Metro stop after the next round of building. Metro needs to continue to expand, and we have plans to build another 100 miles of Metro throughout the region. There will be more inner-city lines and more lines in the suburban communities,” Evans said during a December debate in Georgetown.
This field of candidates recognizes the crucial role that D.C. students and young professionals will have in the city’s future. According to Wells — though ultimately no candidate will completely rid the local government of its reputation for corruption — young people shouldn’t be discouraged from engaging in local politics.
“Young people have every reason to be disillusioned — look no further than D.C. government. It’s one of the most corrupt elected governments in the country right now. But while they have every reason to be disillusioned, they have every reason to believe they can help change it,” Wells said.
Mayoral candidate and Councilmember Vincent Orange (D-Ward 5) could not be reached for comment.
