Georgetown University Student Association President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) will head to Russia next week as part of a program intended to bolster U.S.-Russia relations.
On the trip, Meaney and the other student body presidents selected for the Kremlin Fellows Program will meet with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Duma as well as with Russian youth leaders, who will likely visit the United States as part of a similar program in the near future.
Meaney was selected as one of 15 student body presidents to take part in the week-long program, which is sponsored by the Open World Leadership Center. The group includes representatives from Columbia, Stanford, Harvard, Duke, University of Arizona and Oklahoma State University.
Meaney said he hopes the trip will help solidify the university’s role as an institution steeped in international relations.
“It further enhances Georgetown’s reputation as a student body that is actively engaged and playing a substantive role in a way that many other university student bodies are able to do,” he said.
Upon returning from Russia, Meaney will meet with University President John J. DeGioia and Director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies Angela Stent to discuss his experiences.
Last year, then-GUSA President Calen Angert (MSB ’11) participated in the program. Upon his return, he held an event for students featuring Ilya Yashin, the leader of the Moscow branch of the People’s Freedom Party.
Meaney hopes to work with the university to hold a similar forum for students on the future of Russian-American relations.
“Hopefully what this event can accomplish is to continue to establish Georgetown as a place where all types of dialogue that are critical to global affairs take place,” he said.

According to an Advisory Neighborhood Commission report, neighbors say that student behavior problems persist despite the university’s assurance that there were minimal disturbances last weekend.
The ANC’s report, which was released Tuesday, suggested that student rowdiness remains an acute problem in both Georgetown and Burleith. This conflicts with data from the recent second edition of Rocky’s Report, a weekly public safety update written by Vice President of University Safety Rocco Del Monaco and distributed to neighbors. The update indicated that student-caused disturbances were minimal on the weekend of Nov. 3-5.
Del Monaco wrote that the Metropolitan Police Department has confirmed a decline in noise violations in West Georgetown and Burleith in recent months and that five of six 911 calls last weekend for noise complaints were not linked to Georgetown students.
The release stated that the presence of several university-funded MPD officers, who patrol the area on weekend nights, is partly responsible for a reduction in student noise.
According to Del Monaco, the Student Neighborhood Assistance Program responded to the one noise complaint linked to students and broke up a party of about 20 to 30 students on Winfield Lane Saturday night. In addition, an active SNAP patrol shut down a noisy party on S Street Saturday night.
Despite the university’s efforts to reduce student noise violations and rowdiness on weekend nights, the authors of the ANC report expressed doubt about the university’s ability to live up to its promises to reduce student noise in anticipation of the D.C. Zoning Commission hearing Nov. 17.
In testimony attached to the statement, ANC district 2E commissioner Ed Solomon wrote that he is skeptical of the university’s pledge to reduce student noise because of the frequency of these incidents.
“Based on extensive past experience over the years as well as recent experience, neither my neighbors nor I believe that the university can or will keep things quiet over the long run. The Burleith community and I have heard rosy predictions about this before from the university, and it never has worked,” he wrote.
ANC2E commissioner Ron Lewis echoed Solomon’s sentiments in the statement.
“The loud and disruptive late-night student behavior has continued this fall at the same objectionable levels as in the past,” he wrote. “I have seen no evidence that GU’s additional … MPD officers are active or effective in addressing this noise in the area I represent.”
Solomon wrote that some of his constituents in Burleith considered moving out of the neighborhood because of student-related disturbances.
“I am often out observing late at night, and I am constantly in touch with members of the Burleithcommunity. My neighbors and I have experienced and we continue to experience loud and disruptive objectionable conduct from GU students in and around student group houses and throughout our community,” he wrote. “These conditions continue despite GU’s new initiatives including any increase in reimbursable MPD or increased SNAP presence.”
ANC Commissioner Jake Sticka (COL ’13), whose constituency includes mostly Georgetown students, said Del Monaco’s most recent report suggests that students are not responsible for much of the rowdiness in the area.
“It’s really important for people to be aware that not everything negative that’s happening is [caused by] a student,” he said.
While Sticka said that the university is acting in good faith in releasing the report, he acknowledged that it may be slow to change neighborhood opinions.
“[Georgetown is] trying to let the community know what’s happening on the weekends. It’s an honest depiction. Whether the community is going to take that seriously and accept that as the reality of what’s happening remains to be seen,” he said.
MPD could not be reached for comment.

A change initiated earlier this month in the way Metro customers must manage their money on SmarTrip cards is causing confusion some riders.
According to The Washington Post, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority made changes to comply with the Internal Revenue Service’s 2006 decision to separate parking and public transit funds in SmarTripaccounts.
Before the system’s transformation, when users tapped their cards at Metro stations, the reader displayed the total dollar amount stored on the card. The figure included funds for paying parking fees at municipal parking facilities and fares on Metrorail and Metrobus.
Under the new system mandated by the IRS, users will store funds in separate “purses,” and card readers will only be able to display the contents of one purse at a time, creating the possibility that riders will be confused about the total value on their cards.
To find out how much remains on their cards, riders must tap them against a fare machine, fare box, fare gate or a parking garage exit.
These changes may make things more difficult for Metro patrons, like Leonor Dominguez (MSB ’15).
“People use the metro because they want to travel quickly, and this new system will just complicate things for riders,” she said.

Panelists, including Chinese pro-democracy dissident Wei Jingsheng, discussed the country’s human rights record and the implications of the university’s relationship with Chinese governmental organizations Wednesday night.
The panel, which took place in McShain Lounge, was cosponsored by the International Relations Club, the Lecture Fund and the Georgetown University Students Association. GUSA is spearheading an initiative for Georgetown to engage in dialogue with Chinese human rights activists and the Chinese government.
The event included Huang Ciping, a human rights activist who translated for Wei, as well as Amnesty International Director of Advocacy T. Kumar and Director of Georgetown’s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, & World Affairs and associate professor Tom Banchoff. Fr. Steven Fields, S.J., monitored the spirited discussion.
Wei, who spent 18 years in Chinese prisons before being exiled to the United States, voiced criticism of his home country’s approach to human rights.
“In China, there is only one political party — the Communist Party — and no one can compete,” he said. “With only one party, human rights cannot be well respected,” he said.
Kumar added that half a million people are currently detained by the Chinese government, some for up to 40 years. Religious minorities are especially targeted, according to Kumar.
“No religion is allowed. Only the state-sponsored religion is accepted,” he said.
The most controversial topic of the evening was the Chinese government’s denial of a visa to Georgetown professor James Millward related to his contribution to a book concerning a Muslim area in China. Wei, Kumar and Huang criticized Georgetown’s lack of action on behalf of professor Millward.
“You do not have to be champions, but you must not do damage,” Kumar said. “Georgetown has damaged its own reputation.”
Banchoff defended Georgetown’s handling of the situation and relationship with Chinese governmental organizations, such as the State Administration of Religious Affairs.
“Principles are important, but we live in a complex world,” he said. “We shouldn’t put the relationship [between Georgetown and China] at stake for one scholar’s visa.”
Student opinions were somewhat divided about Chinese-U.S. relations. One student demanded to know what Wei had done for the Chinese people, aside from making speeches.
“You have mentioned that I have often criticized the Chinese government,” Wei said. “That is what I have done for the Chinese people.”
Other students came away with warmer feelings toward Wei.
“I thought he was hilarious,” Sophia Weng (MSB ’15) said. “He’s hoping for a change, and you can tell it through his words.”
The panel concluded on an optimistic note, when Wei was asked about the future of the regime in China.
“If they don’t reform, Chinese people will uprise,” Wei said. “The final conclusion is, China will change.”

Georgetown received a record number of early applications for the Class of 2016 despite the reintroduction of early action application options at several rival institutions.
Last Tuesday, about 6,750 Georgetown hopefuls submitted early action applications, a 1.4 percent increase from last year’s total of 6,658.
This jump came as a surprise to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon, who said that he had originally expected the number of early applicants to drop after Harvard, Princeton and the University of Virginia reinstated early action policies this year.
While the two Ivy League schools recently adopted single-choice early action programs, preventing their applicants from applying to other schools before Nov. 1, UVA initiated a policy similar to Georgetown’s. Under this unrestricted program, high school students may apply to multiple colleges during the early period.
The university’s increase in applications has left the admissions office pleased, as the increase shows a visible rise in demand since students must take the time to apply specifically to Georgetown, which does not accept the common application.
“We’re really happy with these numbers because it means people are coming to us [as a serious choice],” Deacon said. “Georgetown has a growing name recognition and is in higher demand.”
This year’s early application numbers compare favorably with those of other schools. Georgetown saw 6.750 applicants aiming to snag one of 1,600 spots in the Class of 2016. In comparison, UVA received 11,415 early action applications for the roughly 3,300 seats in its freshman class, while while Princeton, with an average class size of 1,275, saw 3,547 applications. According to Harvard University Director of Admissions Marilyn McGrath, the college will not release its early admissions data until next week.
For the early action applicants, the acceptance rate hovers between 17 and 20 percent, typically filling about 17 percent of the freshman class. Deacon said that the university tries to ensure that the same number of early action students enroll at Georgetown each year because of restrictions in on-campus space.
Due to the rise in applications and the jump in yield rates that Georgetown saw last spring, the admission rate of early applicants will see a significant decrease.
According to Deacon, fewer than 17 percent of applicants were admitted from the Class of 2015 early pool, totaling about 1,122 acceptances. This year, Georgetown will likely have to lower the anticipated acceptance rate to about 15 percent, admitting about 1,012 students.
Deacon added that the academic caliber of prospective students has remained steady through each admissions cycle. Although the number of applications jumped, the academic record of this year’s round of early applicants has a combined SAT Critical Reading and Math average of 1360, a number similar to last year’s.
The fact that the quality of the applicant pool held steady even as the size of the pool increased means that more highly qualified applicants are considering Georgetown as a top choice, he said.
“Georgetown is becoming more of a brand to [high] schools who don’t know us as well,” Deacon said.
The improved quantity and quality of these applicants will force the admissions office to be more selective in admitting students.
The diversity of the applicant pool jumped along with its overall size, with the number of Latino and Asian-American applicants increasing by 9 percent and 8 percent to 703 and 845, respectively. The number of prospective international students rose by about 12 percent, from 417 to 468 applicants.
Deacon said that the variety of prospective students in this season’s data shows that the university is succeeding in its goal to diversify its applicant pool.
“The early applicant pool has been traditionally skewed to white students from upper-income backgrounds and prep schools,” Deacon said. “But this year shows how Georgetown continues to follow the trends of the country [in increasing early-action applications from minority students].”
New York continued its tradition of sending the greatest number of early applications, with 632.  Californians took the second spot by mailing in 583 applications, a 10 percent increase from the number for the Class of 2015.
Deacon added that those requesting financial aid have applied in greater numbers this fall, increasing applications from 62 to 68 percent.
“[We] want and plan to hold on to a need-blind financial aid policy,” he said. “This is more of a challenge for us to meet the greater need, but these are great challenges to have.”

Members of Jesuit institutions nationwide will gather for a weekend of learning, prayer, networking and legislative advocacy at the Ignatian Family Teach-In for Justice 2011 this weekend.
The program is held every November to commemorate six Jesuit priests who were murdered in El Salvador for their work advocating on behalf of the poor.
This will be the second year the conference heads to the Hilltop, after being held the 12 years previous at the U.S. Army School of the Americas in Fort Benning, Ga
“We want to take advantage of the location of Georgetown. Being [in] D.C. allows our participants to engage in direct advocacy with Congress and other policymakers,” Christopher Kerr, executive director of the Ignatian Solidarity Network, said.
The national planning committee for the Teach-In consisted of about 50 people from Jesuit institutions across the country. The group included David Monaco, Roman Catholic program director of Georgetown’s Campus Ministry.
University engagement with the conference has expanded under Monaco’s direction.
“Prior to my arrival at Georgetown, our involvement was limited to one trip with members of the GU Knights of Columbus and a staff person from Campus Ministry and another trip led by [the] Georgetown Solidarity Committee,” he said. “Our combined trips were excellent learning trips that brought together diverse groups.”
The weekend’s theme is “The Gritty Reality: Feel It, Think It, Engage It,” which is taken from a speech given by former Jesuit Superior General Fr. Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, S.J, according to Kerr.
“This weekend’s main objective is to inform high school and college students on the key issues of their time and [to construct] a broader network of activists,” Kerr said.
Nearly 1,100 individuals from more than 60 institutions, including 26 Jesuit universities, 20 Jesuit high schools and many Jesuit parishes, are registered to attend the weekend events. About 30 Georgetown students plan to take part.
“We won’t just be attending the conference, but we’ll also have time to come back to our own group afterward and talk about what we learned,” Jordan Denari (SFS ’13) said.
“This is a group of people who I know I can go back to share my thoughts with, because they share the same passion to work for social justice.”
Student who have attended the Teach-In said they left the conference with a deeper understanding of the connections between social justice, the Catholic faith and their studies.
“This will be my fourth year attending the Teach-In,” Denari said. “I think it does a good job at re-energizing the participants’ passion for certain global issues. It allows those of us who are studying these social justice issues to reflect on what we’re doing and put it into perspective and recommit to our studies and work.”
Kieran Halloran (SFS ’14), a student who also attended last year’s Teach-In, said that the conference gave him a chance to better understand his faith.
“It brought the values of social justice closer to my faith,” he said. “Especially when so often Georgetown students get so caught in their studies, this is a great way to widen the scope and understanding toward global issues.”

Undersecretary of the Air Force Erin Conaton (SFS ’92) highlighted the effects of the fiscal constraints and upcoming budget negotiations on national security and the U.S. Air Force Thursday morning.
The discussion, held by the Center for Peace and Security Studies in the Mortara Center, emphasized the uncertainty with which Americans view the national budgetary situation.
Because of the cuts from the Budget Control Act of 2011, the Air Force has begun examining and developing plans for its budget under three main categories: fore-structure, modernization and readiness.
Conaton also addressed the debate over how much funding the military should receive.
During the Q-and-A session of the discussion, topics ranged from cyber warfare and security to the lessons learned from the Libyan civil war and how the budget cuts will affect the use of technology in the military.
Much of Conaton’s career success can be attributed to the education, both in and out of the classroom, that she received as an undergraduate at Georgetown.
“I think Georgetown’s broad-ranging diplomatic and security training has ended up giving me great skills not only on the Hill, but now at the Pentagon,” she said. “I think it’s really not only the great education but the opportunities for student leadership here that help set you up for the future.”
During her time on the Hilltop, Conaton served as chair of both the International Relations Club and the International Relations Association.
Conaton is now responsible for the affairs of the Department of the Air Force, which include organizing, training and equipping all personnel and overseeing the Air Force’s annual budget.

As the number of vacant storefronts at the Shops at Georgetown Park creeps toward 50, the remaining tenants of the mall suspect their realtor could be gearing up to overhaul the building.
According to store managers, the mall’s realtor, Vornado Realty Trust, has stopped renewing leases on the roughly 110 retail spaces in the building. The contracts are set to expire Dec. 31.
There is the possibility that leases could be extended, according to Total Party costume store owner Lorenzo Caltagirone, though the shopping center at the corner of M Street and Wisconsin Avenue has yet to finalize stores that can anchor the center as it undergoes changes.
Business owners have not been informed of what will happen to the space after they leave.
“We knew it was coming,” Tsering Shakya, owner of Dorjebajra Tibet Shop, said. “The worst part about the mall right now is that no one has an answer.”
According to Ava Mutchler, manager at Fornash Designs, the stores have no say in the matter.
“If you had a lease and it’s up, they’re not renewing it,” she said.
“It’s a shame,” Caltagirone said. “I know people who have been here 10 years and were booted out.”
Mutchler said that she is not worried about her store, which sells women’s accessories and jewelry, but she does have concerns about some of the smaller stores.
“We’re not affected because we have a wholesale business. Really what it’s affecting is the mom-and-pop stores — the deli downstairs and the little cafes,” she said.
The uncertainty has been difficult for other stores, such as Total Party, however. Caltagirone fears what the changes could mean for its customer base — Georgetown students and local residents.
“It’s been really difficult, because we order two seasons in advance,” he said. “We are a staple in Georgetown. We’re the only big costume shop in D.C.”
In addition to the stores that have already closed or relocated, some remaining shops, including Comfort One Shoes and Niccolo, are holding liquidation sales to prepare for their closings. Many stores have already begun looking for new spaces in Georgetown and Dupont Circle.
“I would like to stay in Georgetown, but the rents are extremely high,” Caltagirone said. “Unless we do massive volumes, we cannot cover our expenses.”
Renovation plans have not been confirmed by Vornado. Wendi Kopsick, spokeswoman for Vornado, declined to comment.
While the plans for the mall are uncertain, some shop owners  mentioned a rumor that Target might lease the empty space.
Molly Snyder, manager of communications for Target, said that she could not confirm whether the chain is coming to Georgetown.
“Target typically announces its real estate plans for new sites a year before a store is set to open. We don’t have any news to share about that particular location,” she said in an email.
Bloomingdale’s, another rumored contender for space in the mall, also declined to comment on whether the department store was considering opening a branch in the neighborhood.
“We never discuss where we may or may not be looking for store locations,” Bloomingdale’s Operating Vice President for National Media Relations Marissa Vitagliano wrote in an email. “When we have an announcement to make, we [will] make [it] then.”

While many Americans were casting votes in local elections across the country, Georgetown’s politically active engaged in a spirited debate Tuesday night over the hot-button issues that could decide next year’s presidential contest.
The College Republicans, College Democrats and Hoyas for Liberty debated a range of topics for two hours in McNeir Auditorium. Although the debate began with a formal format, a town hall-style discussion soon ensued as passion bubbled over in the 80-person audience.
Representing the Democrats were Nabeel Zewail (SFS ’15), Shom Mazumder (SFS ’15) and Gabrielle Gold (COL ’14). The Republicans brought Ziad Jawadi (COL ’15), Brandon Rosty (COL ’15) and Katie Bolas (COL ’15) as their contenders.
The clubs debate face-to-face once per semester, although this was the first time that Hoyas for Liberty was included in the event. Reilly Poppert (SFS ’15), Michael Mouch (SFS ’15) and Luke Young (MSB ’15) represented the Libertarian student group.
The debaters for Hoyas for Liberty opposed Obama’s re-election, although they generally sided with the Democrats on most issues. Young opened the debate by clarifying what Hoyas for Liberty stands for.
“When we get to campus, there [are] a lot of us at Georgetown who are interested in politics, and it can be really tempting to pigeonhole ourselves into Republicans or Democrats,” he said. “Hoyas for Liberty formulate our own policies based on reason, and we represent critical judgment on the issues.”
The debaters addressed a range of issues, including the Occupy Wall Street movement, sexual harassment charges facing GOP candidate Herman Cain and the contentious individual mandate of the new healthcare bill.
Audience participation began with a few outbursts from attendees. Moderator E.J. Dionne, a government professor and political columnist for The Washington Post, soon allowed onlookers to interrupt with questions.
“I was surprised by how energetic the audience was,” Zewail said after the debate. “At presidential debates the audience is silent, but the crowd involvement definitely added an interesting element to the debate.”

In honor of Veterans’ Day, the Georgetown University Student Veterans of America commemorated the service veterans and current members of the military Wednesday on Copley Lawn.
The event, co-sponsored by Georgetown University Alumni Association and the Reserve Officer Training Corp, featured ROTC student service members, the Marine Corps Drum and the Bugle Corps’ performance of “Commandment’sOwn.” The guest speaker, Brigadier General Kenneth Lee (LAW ’07), deputy commandant for aviation in the United States Marine Corps, gave the final address, reminding all those in attendance that the U.S. armed services are about protecting freedom. Lee underscored the importance of a continuing commitment to supporting the nation’s veterans, specifically through institutions of higher learning, like Georgetown, that help to reintegrate veterans into civilian life.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson closed the ceremony with the flag dedication, taking a moment of silence to honor those who have sacrificed their lives for others. Georgetown, The George Washington University and American University ROTC students were among those presenting the flag.
“This is one of the few professions where I like to believe that the reward received is greater than the sacrifice given,” Calvin Ogbun, a senior at GW, said.
Donna Hernandez (SFS ’13) attended the service in honor of her husband who is currently serving atQuantico Sentry in Virginia. Others came out of respect for their relatives and friends.
“[Service] is a sacrifice for both the family and the service member, which is why support is so important,” Danielle Lujan (COL ’13) said.
After the formal ceremony, a reception was held at the Wagner Alumni House, where students, alumni and veterans were able to interact.
“I think it’s really great when people come together and remember what serving in the military entails,” Mary Birdsall (NHS ’13), a ROTC member, said.
Several veteran attendants emphasized that the Georgetown community has warmly welcomed them and helped them utilize their military background.
“Coming to Georgetown out of the Marines Corps was a pivotal point for me. … The network of community and support has helped me to transition to where I am now,” said Margo Ellis, a second-year student in the School of Continuing Studies program and a Marine Corps veteran.
Colby Howard (SFS ’12), president of GUSVA, who served in the Marine Corps from 2000-2008, noted that veteran support at Georgetown has steadily increased over the past several years but that there is still more room to grow.
“Georgetown gave perspective to my experiences serving, and my experiences serving grounded the education I have received here. They have complemented each other, and I appreciate them both tremendously,” he said.
