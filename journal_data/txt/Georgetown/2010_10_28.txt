A rash of laptop thefts hit Georgetown’s campus this week. One laptop was stolen last Thursday, three laptops were stolen on Sunday and another was stolen on Tuesday, according to the Department of Public Safety.
On Thursday, Oct. 21, a student’s laptop was stolen via an unlocked patio door to a Village A apartment while the student and his roommates were sleeping, according to a Public Safety Alert sent Thursday. Two unattended laptops in Lauinger Library were taken from cubicles on Sunday, according to DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith. A laptop was also stolen from Village A apartment E202 on Tuesday after the apartment was left unlocked. Allegedly, the apartment was broken into around 6 p.m.
Clare Carluccio’s (COL ’13) laptop was one of two taken from the library on Sunday. After leaving her computer unattended from around 5:30 until 6 p.m., Carluccio returned to an empty cubicle.
“I’m just very trusting, and I never thought anything would be taken. I leave stuff all the time but not anymore,” she said.
The thefts are not random occurrences at Georgetown, according to Smith.
“Quite often, students and employees will have left their laptops unattended and when they return, find it missing,” he said. “A student will have a study area, and they don’t want to lose that study area.”
Metropolitan Police Department Sgt. Cook, who reported to the burglary on Tuesday, said he and his colleagues had been called to campus an inordinate amount of times this week for laptop thefts.
“People aren’t locking their doors, and they’re paying for it,” Cook said.
Smith offered guidance to students after the thefts in Lauinger. “It only takes a second for someone to pick it up and put into their own backpacks and it’s immediately concealed . I appreciate that there’s sometimes a lot of competition for study space, but you don’t want to lose an expensive laptop,\” he said.
As Cook was leaving the scene Tuesday night, he left Georgetown students with a piece of advice: “Look out for the guy carrying 17 Macbooks,” he told The Hoya.

Charles Smith (SFS ’14) and University of Richmond freshman John Perrone, who were arrested on Saturday after an alleged DMT lab was found in Smith’s Harbin Hall room, were released after a hearing in D.C.’s U.S. District Court Wednesday.
Smith and Perrone’s lawyers waived their clients’ right to a preliminary and a pre-detention hearing. Judge Deborah Robinson, the presiding judge at the hearing, ordered that Smith and Perrone be placed into the custody of their parents in Andover, Mass. until their next D.C. court date on Jan. 24.
Smith and Perrone face federal charges of “conspiracy to manufacture” and “possession with intent to distribute” Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) after officials discovered an alleged drug lab early Saturday morning in Harbin 926, Smith’s dorm room.
John Romano (COL ’14), Smith’s roommate, was also arrested on Saturday but was released and relieved of all charges at a Monday hearing at U.S. District Court. According to The Washington Post, Smith informed officials that Romano was not involved in any illegal activity after they both had been taken into custody.
Smith and Perrone could each be sentenced to 20 years in prison and fines of $1 million, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s federal trafficking penalties for a Schedule I drug like DMT. An endogenous hallucinogen that can be inhaled, smoked or ingested, DMT can replicate the sensation of a near-death experience or a dreaming state.
Smith and Perrone must now report to federal pre-trial services in Massachusetts no later than the end of business hours on Friday. Robinson has ordered that they be subjected to electronic monitoring that will bar them from exiting a to-be-determined radius in the Massachusetts and New Hampshire area.
Other provisions of the release require Smith and Perrone to comply with a curfew and undergo drug and substance abuse testing. They must also seek and maintain full-time employment or enrollment in a university while they reside at their parents’ addresses. The U.S. District Court in Massachusetts has accepted courtesy supervision of Smith and Perrone until their next court date.
“They’re young men and scared to death,” Alan Dale, Perrone’s lawyer, said after his client’s release. “We are moving forward,” said David Schertler, Smith’s lawyer.

First-year student Kelly Baltazar, a resident of Harbin Hall Room 229, was arrested Tuesday evening by the Metropolitan Police Department, according to university spokeswoman Julie Bataille.
At her arraignment Wednesday, Baltazar pled not guilty and was released from custody. She will undergo drug testing and treatment and her next hearing is scheduled for Nov. 19, according to the D.C. Superior Court docket.
According to MPD spokesman Hugh Carew, MPD was called to campus at approximately 7 p.m. Tuesday for the arrest, which was made on grounds of “possession with the intent to distribute marijuana.”
Last Friday, the Department of Public Safety received an anonymous tip, according to an officer in the Department of Public Safety who asked not to be named. The officer said that it took DPS until Tuesday to hone in on the suspect. He added that the amount of marijuana allegedly in Baltazar’s possession was enough to warrant suspicions of intent to sell.
On Monday, DPS notified MPD that Baltazar was selling marijuana. MPD searched Baltazar’s room and found a green weed-like substance that tested positive for THC, the main psychoactive substance found in the cannabis plant, according to the MPD Incident Report. Baltazar was subsequently placed under arrest and the marijuana was confiscated as evidence.
Baltazar is facing disciplinary action from the university for a category C violation of the Student Code of Conduct for possessing a controlled substance with the intent to distribute. If found guilty of a category C violation, a student faces suspension or expulsion from the university.
“We will take appropriate and prompt action related to these cases under our code of student conduct, which remains a confidential process consistent with our educational mission,” university spokeswoman Julie Bataille said in an email.
Bataille, Carew and Garrison initially declined to comment on whether Baltazar’s arrest is linked to the ongoing investigation into the DMT lab discovered in Harbin Room 926 early Saturday morning.
On Oct. 27, Bataille said that the university believes the two cases to be unrelated.
“This investigation is separate from another that remains ongoing related to the arrests of two other students, Charles Smith and John Romano, on drug charges over the weekend,” Bataille said in an email. “We are working actively with MPD to understand if there are any connections but at this time believe they are unrelated incidents.”
