Fifteen Georgetown students studying abroad in Hong Kong this semester have been told to leave the city after announcements Nov. 13 that the programs would end early because of ongoing political unrest in the city. 
Georgetown students are enrolled in two programs in Hong Kong: 11 students are studying at The Chinese University of Hong Kong and four students are studying at City University of Hong Kong through a Syracuse University program, according to Georgetown University spokesperson Meghan Dubyak. 
Protests have rocked Hong Kong for months, but within the last week, the previously isolated demonstrations have reached universities. The Chinese University announced the shortening of its term and cancellation of all classes, effective immediately, and Syracuse University emailed students to share that it is ending its fall program early. Students in Syracuse’s program were given until Nov. 19 at 4 p.m. to check out of their student housing. 
The protests escalated rapidly in recent days, according to Livvy Gordon (SFS ’21), who was studying at the Chinese University. 
“Once the protests spread to university campuses, the situation changed dramatically,” Gordon wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Within 3 days, the semester abruptly ended and we received notice to leave Hong Kong.” 
In February, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam introduced legislation that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong, which ignited massive protests across the city as residents grew concerned that the mainland Chinese government would abuse the bill. Lam has since withdrawn the bill, but demonstrations have continued as protesters call for institutional reforms in Hong Kong, such as addressing police brutality and increasing democratic freedom.
Frustrated by the lack of governmental response, more protesters have begun resorting to more violent forms of protest, including firing arrows at police officers. Officers have been using harsher measures to counter that violence, which have resulted in at least one civilian death in the last week, according to BBC News.
The dramatic escalation of the protests, along with a fire on City University’s campus, drove Syracuse’s decision to cancel its program, according to Darcy Palder (COL ’21). (Full disclosure: Palder formerly served as an Opinion assistant for The Hoya). 
“After the death of one of the protesters, the protests have escalated. Our classes were canceled for three days in a row,” Palder wrote in a message to The Hoya. “And then one night, the whole program was sitting together and we found out that one of the buildings in our university was set on fire and we knew we were going home.”
As violence has moved closer to the campuses, students have been instructed to stay indoors as much as possible and food shortages have developed at local cafeterias, known as canteens, according to Gordon; chaos has also led to a fire at the nearby Mass Transit Railway station.
“Police are launching round after round of teargas on campus, the University MTR station is on fire, all entrances to the school are inaccessible by car, and the streets are covered in chairs, traffic cones, umbrellas, and anything else that can serve as a projectile,” Gordon wrote. “Food supply is a serious issue, as canteens now have very limited hours due to low staff and delivery of produce to the university is incredibly challenging.”
City University, where Syracuse’s program is located, has not canceled its classes for the rest of the term, as of Nov. 15. Classes were canceled from Nov. 14 to Nov. 17 and City University’s term ends Nov. 30, according to its website. 
City University is working with Syracuse to ensure all directly enrolled international students will be able to complete their coursework remotely, according to an email to students from Mary Fedorko, Syracuse Abroad’s admissions counselor for Hong Kong obtained by The Hoya. 
Georgetown will also work with its students to support them in completing their semester’s coursework, according to Dubyak. 
“Once students have been safely relocated, the University will work with them to ensure that they are able to complete the remainder of their academic coursework remotely,” Dubyak wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Though academic flexibility will allow students to complete the semester, Syracuse has not provided adequate support for students in other areas. The program has failed to assist students needing to rapidly make flight plans, according to Palder. 
University insurance will cover the cost of flight changes and transportation to the airport, but it may not cover flight changes that do not return students directly home or are not on Nov. 19, the “approved departure date,” according to Fedorko’s email. 
Students must pay for scheduling their Nov. 19 flights themselves and will only be reimbursed later, according to Palder. 
“I really do understand how hard it must be for Syracuse to rearrange everything and that the protests are out of their control, but they really have not been sensitive to the financial burdens this imposes upon the students,” Palder wrote. “We are now up until the AM trying to figure out how to get home because they haven’t provided any guidance.”
Despite the disappointment and surprise of her semester abroad ending suddenly, Gordon expressed her gratitude at experiencing such a significant moment in Hong Kong. 
“I feel extremely grateful to have been able to study abroad in Hong Kong during this pivotal time in its history,” Gordon wrote. “I have learned much more about the fight for democracy, political corruption, and global affairs by being there in the midst of this political chaos than I could have learned in any classroom.”
While living in Hong Kong over the past few months provided an invaluable opportunity, Palder acknowledged her privilege as a foreign student caught in the midst of localized political conflict. 
“I can leave when things get hard, but the protesters and the citizens of Hong Kong cannot,” Palder wrote. “The protests have been an inconvenience for me, but they’re determining people’s futures.”

Shiva Subbaraman, director of the LGBTQ Resource Center, will concurrently serve as executive director of the Georgetown University Women’s Center effective immediately, according to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson.
Subbaraman’s appointment as director of the Women’s Center comes over a year after former Director Laura Kovach resigned in October 2018. The center, which provides support, programming and resources for women on campus, has not had a director since Kovach’s departure. Three undergraduate students working at the center have maintained its operations, two of whom were hired this semester, as The Hoya reported in October.
Subbaraman’s term as dual executive director became effective as of Nov. 12, and she will continue to report directly to Olson, as she did as the LGBTQ Center’s director, according to an email Olson sent to The Hoya.
Subbaraman has served as director of the LGBTQ Center, which provides resources and programming for LGBTQ students and allies, since the center’s inception in 2008.
Despite her new dual role, Subbaraman stressed the importance of distinguishing the work and function of the two centers to honor their original goals and the students they serve.
“Given the context of a Jesuit institution, it is really key that the Centers exist as the Women’s Center, and the LGBTQ Center: they send clear messages of healing, hope, and growth —since many of these have been areas of pain, marginalization, and difficulty for many decades,” Subbaraman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Centers origins—in student activism—have remained at the core of the work, even as they have grown to be more imaginatively aligned with institutional mission and vision.”
Last year, Olson and Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Jeanne Lord created a working group of students, faculty and staff to decide the next steps for both the Women’s Center and the LGBTQ Center, according to Subbaraman. Following its reassessment, the working group issued recommendations that the two centers keep their distinct identities under one executive director, Subbaraman said. 
The university looks forward to seeing Subbaraman apply her experience running the LGBTQ center to her new role as dual director, according to Olson.
“Shiva has provided visionary and caring leadership for our LGBTQ Resource Center for more than a decade, moving it from an initial idea to a vibrant and visible presence on campus,” Olson wrote. “I am confident that she will bring her talents to this new role in a very effective way.”
In recent months, Subbaraman has provided guidance to the Women’s Center alongside her work with the LGBTQ Center, according to Caroline Sarda (COL ’20). Sarda, who has worked at the Women’s Center since her sophomore year, is currently the center’s most experienced staff member.
The new leadership framework will improve the centers’ ability to serve the Georgetown community and better meet the changing needs of students, according to Subbaraman.
“The two Centers have historically worked closely together because our students are not ‘single issue’ people,” Subbaraman wrote. “This structural alignment would allow us to meet the complex and diverse needs of our students more fully.”
While Subbarman’s appointment is an opportunity to recognize the intersections between the work of the two centers and deliver more diverse programming and services, two separate directors would better serve the community in terms of balancing the workload for each position, according to Sarda.
“I think this is a good way to establish better coordination between the two centers in terms of programming,” Sarda wrote in an email to The Hoya. “However, I think it is still important to have additional, separate directors for each center, in order to better manage workload, day-to-day operations, and student support.”
As a result of understaffing and the lack of any full-time staff members, student workers at the Women’s Center have only held co-hosted programming with the LGBTQ Center this semester. Additionally, student staff members from the LGBTQ Center have taken shifts in the Women’s Center to make up for the vacancy in the director position, as reported by The Hoya in October.
The university is also taking steps to expand the full-time staff at the Women’s Center by forming a search committee to search for a new associate director, according to Subbaraman; the committee will be co-chaired by Director of the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access Charlene Brown McKenzie and College Vice Dean Sue Lorenson. 
The LGBTQ Center also recently hired Amena Johnson as a full-time assistant director. Johnson’s work will be focused on building programs, peer education and developing retreats, according to Subbaraman.
Both the LGBTQ Center and the Women’s Center need more full-time support to reach their full potential as resources for students, according to Sarda. 
“I think this is a step in the right direction; however, I think it is still very necessary to have more staffing dedicated to the two centers,” Sarda wrote. “Students need and deserve a strong support system on this campus, and I think it is important to continue devoting more university resources to growing that system, which includes providing more full-time staff in both centers.”
This article was updated Nov. 15 to include details on the university working group and to clarify references to The Hoya’s earlier reporting.

Zev Burton (SFS ’22), a Georgetown University Student Association senator and the senate ethics and oversight committee chair, resigned Nov. 11. 
Burton, who was elected senator in April 2019, announced his resignation in an email to the GUSA senate Monday afternoon, citing senate-related disputes and personal circumstances. 
As the ethics and oversight committee chair, Burton monitored senators’ attendance records at meetings and tracked potential conflicts of interest within GUSA. The former Ethics and Oversight Vice Chair Chris Ziac (SFS ’22) will assume Burton’s responsibilities as chair of the committee.
Though Burton counts GUSA as a highlight of his Georgetown experience, the organization also took an emotional toll on him, he wrote in the Nov. 11 email to the GUSA senate obtained by The Hoya. 
“When I expected help I found pushback, when I asked to learn I was berated, and when I tried to do my job I was disrespected,” Burton wrote. “To be blunt, I did not feel treated well and I was frequently frustrated. I didn’t come to Georgetown or run for GUSA to be locked up in petty disagreements.” 
Some senators pushed back on the policies of the ethics and oversight committee, making the role of chair difficult, according to Burton. 
“It was very hard for me to be kind of the cop in the oversight measure because people don’t like when others hold them accountable,” Burton said in an interview with The Hoya.
Burton’s perception of the senate atmosphere is not universal. The environment within this year’s senate fostered support and success, according to GUSA Senate Speaker Juan Martinez (SFS ’20).
“While the Senate has had some passionate debates this year, it is my perception that they have remained respectful and the work of the Senate has actually benefited from them,” Martinez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I believe it is this atmosphere that has allowed the Senate to thrive, passing various bills on important matters and collaborating internally to achieve our policy objectives.” 
As chair, Burton helped usher in a series of reforms on the ethics and oversight committee, including changing the structure to include GUSA executive and student body representative voting members. On Nov. 10, the day before his resignation, Burton introduced a second bill aiming to codify new ethics and oversight committee absence policies and resulting consequences. 
Burton planned to rework the ethics and oversight committee to become a resource for senators instead of a disciplinary body but found those aspirations to be unattainable, he said.
“I wanted to make ethics and oversight more like a human resources department, like we’re here to help, as opposed to kind of an oversight body like the cops in a security state,” Burton said. “This past weekend, once ethics and oversight started trying to act in its HR capacity, I realized there was no way for it to do it under my leadership.”
The GUSA senate will hold an election to choose a new ethics and oversight committee vice chair at its next weekly meeting Nov. 17, according to Martinez. The speaker notified GUSA President Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20), Vice President Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) and the election commission about Burton’s resignation, but the commission has not yet announced plans to fill the vacant senate seat. 
Personal circumstances also influenced Burton’s decision to resign. Burton said he could not adequately fulfill his senatorial duties. 
“I cannot give GUSA 100 percent focus right now, and it would be awful and disrespectful to fellow senators, to the people who voted me in, to everyone who’s been working so hard, if I’m sitting there in meetings and I’m busy thinking about something else,” Burton said. “It is much better to have someone else like Chris in there, who’s going to do such a great job, who’s able to give his full attention to it.”
Burton would have considered remaining in the position if daily operations of the senate focused more on policy and advocacy for the campus community, he said. 
“I think if we had been more focused on policy and every senator had been dedicated to showing up, doing their job and making it better for Georgetown, which I believe many senators in there are doing, then I think there’s a possibility I would have stayed,” Burton said. 
In his new role as chair of the ethics and oversight committee, Ziac will convey explicit expectations for his fellow senators, he said. 
“Clear communication can solve so many problems, so I am hoping that as chair I can be sure to be clear about what I want and I expect both from members of the committee and people I might call before the committee to talk with,” Ziac said. “I am pretty confident that I will be able to keep things calm and clear.”

Over 100 Georgetown University students advocated for immigrants without documentation in a walkout Nov. 8 before a Supreme Court hearing on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program Tuesday.
The #HomeIsHere Walkout was hosted by Hoyas For Immigrant Rights and co-sponsored by over 40 other student clubs and university organizations. The HFIR-led walkout was part of the national #HomeIsHere movement, which advocates for the preservation of DACA. The Friday walkout had 157 attendees, according to HFIR President Arisaid Gonzalez Porras (COL ’21).
DACA, a policy introduced by former President Barack Obama in 2012, provides protections to immigrants who arrived in the country without documentation before the age of 16. The rights included in the legislation encompass eligibility for work permits and renewable protection from deportation. An estimated 700,000 individuals in the United States are DACA recipients, according to U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
President Donald Trump announced plans to dismantle DACA in 2017. After numerous lawsuits, including those by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Regents of the University of California, many federal courts have deemed the motion to end DACA unlawful. Following these suits, the case was brought up to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments by Solicitor General Noel Francisco, Washington lawyer Theodore Olson and California Solicitor General Michael Mongan, among others, on Nov. 12.
The #HomeIsHere Walkout began on Healy Lawn, where organizers handed out shirts and beanies that said “Unstoppable, Undeniable, Undocumented, and Unafraid” to attendees. Four Georgetown DACA recipients spoke on their experiences as immigrants without documentation, including former Georgetown University Student Association President and current GUSA senate Speaker Juan Martinez (SFS ’20). Students without documentation face obstacles in accessing opportunities and resources because of their status, according to Martinez. 
“The older I got, the more I started to understand what it meant. It was often defined by nots or things I couldn’t do,” Martinez said at the walkout. “Whenever I asked in high school to be able to go to other states for debate tournaments or even to go abroad, I was told I couldn’t because I was undocumented. When someone broke into our house and attempted to assault and rob my mother, I asked her why we couldn’t do anything about it, and she said it was because we were undocumented.”
After the speeches, participants marched from Georgetown’s front gates to Dupont Circle. When they arrived at the Supreme Court, they were joined by 15 local high schools and universities at the event. HFIR requested and was granted city permits as well as police escorts and medics for participants to ensure student safety, according to Arelis Palacios, associate director of the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access and associate director for Undocumented Student Services.
Walkout attendees included representatives from various student groups, including GUSA President Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20), who spoke on his own behalf, and GUSA Vice President Aleida Olvera (COL ’20). The GUSA executive supports students without documentation on campus, according to Francis.
“We hope to be in solidarity with Hoyas for Immigrant Rights and a lot of our mixed-status students and undocumented students as well,” Francis said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is something Aleida and I care very deeply about.” 
The university has also shown its support for undocumented students by joining 18 other colleges and universities in filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court on Oct. 7 in support of DACA. Previously, University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) and other university presidents in October 2017 urged Congress to pass the DREAM Act, legislation that would grant residency status to many minors who are currently part of DACA. 
The walkout was intended to emphasize how the Supreme Court’s decision would affect the future of DACA recipients in their aspirations, according to an email circulated by HFIR to its members before the demonstration.
“If the DACA program ends, all our DACA students on campus run this risk of deportation and lose their ability to enter their career fields after graduation,” the email read. “Therefore, walkouts are being planned all over DC by high schools and universities to show the nation this is an issue that will impact more than just the 800,000 DACA recipients.”
Before the event, HFIR organized two poster-making events, one at La Casa Latina on Nov. 6 and one at the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service building on Nov. 7, and also held two information sessions in the Intercultural Center on Oct. 30 and Nov. 3.
The walkout was sponsored by numerous student groups and university organizations, including the CSJ. Sponsoring the #HomeIsHere Walkout aligns with the CSJ’s support for DACA and Temporary Protected Status students.
“The Center for Social Justice stands with DACA and TPS recipients and their families, some who are fellow Hoyas,” CSJ Associate Director Ray Shiu wrote in an email to The Hoya. “CSJ will continue to support HFIR’s advocacy and activism as they continue to live out Georgetown’s mission and values; they truly are living as Hoyas For Others.”
The walkout reflected Georgetown’s solidarity with students without documentation and set the precedent that students without documentation will continue to be a strong presence at Georgetown, according to Porras.
“With everything that has happened on and off campus, the solidarity and support my peers showed was incredible,” she wrote in an email to the Hoya. “Moving forward, we continue to host events, dialogues, and actions where needed. Our presence is strong on campus and we hope it continues.”

The university will likely not implement a tuition freeze in the near future, university administrators said at the Hoya Roundtable on tuition rate-setting on Nov. 9.
Hoya Roundtables, organized by the Office of the Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, enable students and administrators to discuss issues of interest to students, according to its website. At the fall 2019 Hoya Roundtable in the Healey Family Student Center, administrators discussed how tuition is spent and future plans for setting tuition rates. 
This roundtable comes after the Georgetown University Law Center Student Bar Association called for a university-wide tuition freeze in a resolution submitted to Law Center Dean William Treanor on Oct. 15. The SBA resolution was drafted to express solidarity with Georgetown undergraduate students who called for a tuition freeze in a Feb. 15 editorial in The Hoya.
The annual percent increase of total undergraduate tuition and fees has fallen since 2014, but Provost Robert Groves said he is unsure of the likelihood of a tuition freeze.
“We have seen the numbers. We are on a downward trend,” Groves said. “Whether we will ever get to frozen tuition has to do with can we raise philanthropy with such a successful level that it obviates the need to increase tuition in order to pay for the increased cost.”
While the university’s undergraduate tuition has risen for eight consecutive years, yearly tuition hikes have been decreasing. Undergraduate tuition for the 2019-20 academic year increased by 2.8%, down from the 3.5% increase enacted last year. 
The board of directors meets in the winter to review the budget proposals and again in the spring to approve a budget for the following year. Once the budget is finalized, the administrators announce their tuition plan. The proposed budgets depend on the cost of resources made available to students like study abroad programs and mental health services as well as any new projects the university plans to undertake, according to Groves.
Administrators are working to make the campus more compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act and intend to begin with White-Gravenor Hall, according to Chief Operating Officer Geoffrey Chatas (CAS ’85).
“This is a challenging campus to navigate,” Chatas said. “We are committed to making sure we make those investments in our new buildings.”
Last November, the university announced that it was planning to construct a ramp to the front entrance of White-Gravenor, which requires the use of stairs to reach the door. The project’s design was expected to be completed by early 2019, with construction set to start in the summer of 2019. White-Gravenor already has a ramp, but it is set is at a far corner of the building and leads into the basement.
The university also plans to renovate the Village C dormitories and intramural fields within the next two summers, according to Chatas.
Georgetown’s relatively small endowment compared to peer universities complicates the university’s efforts to minimize tuition increases. Georgetown receives only 8% of its revenue from the income earned by its endowment’s investments, while other universities receive closer to 30% or 50%, according to Chatas. The endowment is used to offer students financial aid and a low endowment can necessitate higher tuition. 
In an effort to increase the size of its endowment, Georgetown launched a series of fundraising campaigns in 2017. Last year was the best fundraising year the university has seen yet, according to Chatas.
The roundtable is an opportunity for the administration to attempt to be transparent with students in the tuition rate-setting process, according to Groves. 
“This is a commitment on our part to try to be as transparent as we can, to give you a sense of financial structure of the university, and the role of tuition in that financial structure, and to give you a sense of how we go about trying to manage those revenues and those costs in the best way we can,” Groves said.

D.C. Water, a company that distributes drinking water to Washington, D.C. residents, issued a boil water advisory for upper Northwest D.C. after a water transmission main broke in Arlington, Va. on Nov. 8. 
Many Georgetown students received an emergency alert mobile push notification from the District’s emergency alert system Friday morning around 10 a.m. announcing the boil water advisory. Although there was ultimately no water contamination, the advisory called for residents and restaurants to boil water to eliminate potentially dangerous bacteria before drinking or cooking. The city lifted the advisory Nov. 10 after testing the water for contamination.
The university did not send an email to students clarifying the that the advisory did not apply to campus. No water from campus was impacted by contamination, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Georgetown University was not affected by the boil water advisory that was issued by D.C. Water on Friday,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “University officials stayed in close contact with D.C. Water and monitored the active map to ensure that no campus locations were affected by the advisory.” 
The water main break, which occurred at Glebe Road and Chain Bridge Road in Arlington, caused low water pressure, which could have allowed contaminants to enter the water supply, according to D.C. Water External Communications Manager Pamela Mooring. 
“It is out of an abundance of caution that we issue a boil water advisory,” Mooring wrote in an email to The Hoya.
D.C. Water gathered water samples in different areas of the impact zone, according to Mooring. The company sent the first round of sampling to the lab Nov. 8 following the water main break, and those results came back negative for contamination Nov. 9. 
D.C. Water then collected a second round of samples, which also came back negative, prompting D.C. Water to lift the advisory Nov. 10, according to Mooring.
Although Georgetown’s water was not impacted, Students of Georgetown, Inc., commonly referred to as The Corp, locations on campus stopped serving iced coffee for about an hour after seeing the D.C. Water advisory the morning of Nov. 8, The Corp’s Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Jack Heringer (MSB ’20) said in an interview with The Hoya. 
“I was in contact with the University and following updates about the water advisory, but they hadn’t published anything concrete, so just as a proactive step we stopped serving iced coffee,” Heringer said. “It was purely precautionary, just to make sure we had all of our bases covered.”
After he received confirmation from the university that Georgetown’s campus did not lie within the boil water advisory zone, all Corp locations resumed normal service, according to Heringer.
Lily Howard (COL ’23) said she did not know about the water advisory until she tried to order an iced coffee from The Corp’s Grounded location and employees told her they were only serving hot coffee because of the warning from D.C. Water. 
“I figured if the Hilltoss water might have been contaminated then maybe other water sources at Georgetown were contaminated,”  Howard said. “So, I made sure to not drink from the water fountains and only buy hot drinks from coffee shops that day.” 
Many coffee shops within the impact zone stopped selling coffee during the advisory, according to The Washington Post. The advisory impacted 100,000 Arlington and Northwest D.C. residents. 
The impact zone did encompass American University’s main campus and the associated Washington College of Law, among other AU locations, according to The Eagle. In response, the university provided bottled water in residence halls and advised all members of the AU community to boil drinking and cooking water.
Those in the impact area were advised to boil water for drinking, brushing teeth, preparing and cooking food, washing fruits and vegetables, preparing infant formula, making ice and giving water to pets, according to a D.C. Water news release. 
Although no contamination was detected, D.C. Water commended their clients for taking safety measures, according to a news release. 
“We sincerely appreciate our customers’ patience while we took necessary precautions to deliver water to our customers,” the news release said.
This article has been updated to clarify that Georgetown University did not send the push notification to students.

The Georgetown University Student Association senate passed new legislation to standardize the organization’s senator absence policy at their most recent meeting Nov. 10.
The bill, introduced by former Ethics and Oversight Committee Chair Zev Burton (SFS ’22) before his resignation, codifies specific consequences for absences accumulated by senators throughout a session. The bill passed unanimously in the senate in a 24-0 vote, but has not yet been signed by the GUSA Executive.
Under the old absence policy, though three absences were grounds for impeachment, the policy was not fully enforced. Under the new system, the Ethics and Oversight Committee, which was created in 2018 to track senators’ attendance records at meetings and monitor potential conflicts of interest within GUSA, may consider impeachment after a senator accrues three unexcused absences. The committee is now mandated to pursue impeachment after a senator’s fourth unexcused absence.
Burton resigned from the GUSA senate a day after introducing the legislation because of personal reasons and disputes within GUSA related to the ethics and oversight committee. The former vice-chair of the ethics and oversight committee, Chris Ziac (SFS ’22), assumed Burton’s responsibilities as the current chair of the committee as of Nov. 12.
The new standardized absence policy will allow operations of the senate to be more productive and benefit GUSA’s mission overall, Ziac said in an interview with The Hoya.
“Hopefully by making this much more standard and clear, people will, again, take it more seriously and put more effort into GUSA to foster a better environment for everybody,” Ziac said. “I think this will, not only in terms of absences, but in terms of personal responsibility, will hopefully get senators thinking more about taking some of the stuff more seriously and being aware of how their actions from committee or from whatever impacts the work of GUSA.” 
The 2018-19 GUSA senate saw senator absences quadruple from the previous year’s legislative body. Senators accumulated 43 unexcused absences without proxies during the term. 
In terms of absences this semester, the transition chair of the ethics and oversight committee, Senator Leo Teixeira (COL ’21), introduced articles of impeachment against Peter Hamilton (COL ’20) after he accrued a series of unexcused absences throughout the spring and summer terms. The GUSA senate impeached Hamilton in an 11-2 vote Aug. 12. However, the senate later voted 10-6 not to remove Hamilton from the senate Aug. 26. 
The new bill aims to clarify areas of the GUSA bylaws around absences and impeachment that were previously vague or unclear, according to Teixeira. 
“What is good about this bill I think going forward is it is going to allow for that uniformity that is much needed in various areas,” Teixeira said in an interview with The Hoya. “It will only continue to do what the ethics and oversight committee is supposed to do, which is to bring more accountability to the senate.”
Under the new legislation, a senator earning repeated unexcused absences would be required to attend meetings with various members of the ethics and oversight committee leadership, as well as GUSA senate leadership, depending on the number of absences accrued. 
The legislation would also empower the ethics and oversight committee to recommend senators issue a public apology if they accumulate repeated absences. This measure could also, however, lead to disingenuous statements, according to Hamilton. 
“I think the punishments are generally appropriate. That being said, one of the suggested consequences includes requiring a senator to make a public apology,” Hamilton wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I find requiring people to apologize to be a little over the top. I would rather an honest apology than a forced one.”
The ethics and oversight committee restructured the committee to include executive representatives and student body voting members at the end of October. This reform came after Teixeira led a working group over the summer to assess problems within the committee and recommend solutions.
The absence bill adheres to the ethics and oversight working group’s recommendations, according to Teixeira. 
“Part of what we pushed for is exactly what’s in this bill, so I will commend the bill for that, for heeding the advice of the working group and the conclusions that we came up with and published,” Teixeira said. 
Though the senator absence bill and general committee restructure were the two main reform goals of the committee for the semester, Ziac also endorsed the possibility of expanding impeachment bylaw policies in the future.
“The structure and absence thing were definitely the two main things that we wanted to get done as soon as possible in the session,” Ziac said. “I’ve thought about looking into specifically the impeachment process because I think the bylaws are kind of lacking on that too, but that’s probably a bit down the road. Hopefully, it shouldn’t be too important of an issue.”

A visiting researcher was trapped inside one of Lauinger Library’s main lobby elevators for about 45 minutes after it sustained damage around 4:30 p.m. Nov. 12.
The researcher was safely rescued, but the incident’s specific cause remains unknown. The other main lobby elevator remains operational while the affected elevator car is being repaired by the Georgetown University Office of Planning and Facilities Management, but the university has not provided an official timeline for when repairs will finish.
An unknown impact from either an individual or a piece of equipment caused the elevator to break, according to Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Benjamin Kuo.
“As a result of the impact, the door fell inwards, temporarily preventing the door from reopening while an individual was onboard,” Kuo wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Facilities and GUPD are working together to review the camera footage and identify the source responsible for the damage.”
Facilities is working with the Georgetown University Police Department to review camera footage and identify the source of the damage to the elevator, according to Kuo.
The researcher was safely rescued by Georgetown facilities and the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department after being trapped for around 45 minutes, according to Beth Marhanka, head of Gelardin New Media Center on Lauinger’s first floor.
“Unfortunately, a visiting researcher who had just bought coffee in the Midnight Mug was in the elevator when it became stuck between the 2nd and 3rd floors of Lauinger,” Marhanka wrote in an email to The Hoya. “She was very patient and in good spirits while we waited for the elevator technician and the fire department to open the door.”
Workers responded to the incident from various offices, including GUPD and the local fire department, according to The Midnight MUG barista Ellie Farrell (COL ’22), who was working at the coffee shop when the elevator broke.
“There were multiple police officers, probably five or six, on both Lau 2 and 3 shouting and knocking on the elevator and a fire truck in the parking lot for at least an hour,” Farrell wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It looked like there was a hole in the wall on Lau 3 it was scary.”
Despite the disruption, normal library activities were only affected for a short time Tuesday, according to Marhanka.
“The second public elevator had to be turned off for about 15 minutes while the fire department and the technician assessed the situation and worked to open the door of the broken elevator,” Marhanka wrote. “During that short period of time, library patrons had to use the stairs. The 2nd public elevator has been operational except for that brief period of time it was turned off.”
The latest elevator malfunction comes less than a month after malfunctions in a Harbin Hall elevator led the car to drop and trap a first-year student for almost two hours. After arriving at the scene and rescuing the student, facilities determined that an improperly functioning governor’s switch caused the accident. When it works correctly, an elevator’s governor’s switch is a safety measure that triggers brakes if the elevator accelerates to an unsafe speed.
Students in Reynolds Hall and Darnall Hall also complained about persistent elevator issues in November 2018. Elevators in both buildings dropped and trapped students inside. These past elevator issues have since been resolved, and elevators across campus are working normally.
However, the majority of facilities issues reported on campus are not elevator malfunctions. Students reported that mold in their dormitories made for unsafe living conditions, and 84 residents on the top floor of Alumni Square dormitories were relocated due to water damage in Alumni Square’s roof.
The university takes care to prepare for possible elevator malfunctions, according to Kuo.
“We have processes in place to rapidly respond to out of service elevators and work to resolve issues as quickly as possible,” Kuo wrote. “The time to repair and service elevators varies depending on what mechanical or electrical issues are present.”
Kuo added that the rest of Lauinger’s elevators are operating normally and safely.
“While the damaged elevator temporarily remains out of commission, all other elevators in Lauinger remain safe and operational,” Kuo wrote. “We encourage any community members to report any issues or concerns to Facilities Management.”

Graduates of the Master of Business Administration program in the class of 2019 set record salaries this year, the McDonough School of Business announced Nov. 11. The news comes as the school’s full-time MBA program was ranked 19th in the U.S. by Bloomberg Businessweek in an announcement Nov. 4, one place higher than last year.
The average starting salary for 2019 MBA graduates was reported to be $124,119, a 6% increase from last year, and 95% of graduates received a job offer within three months of graduation, according to the MSB’s 2019 employment report. Employers of the class of 2019 included industry-leading companies like Amazon, Goldman Sachs and Deloitte. 
An increase in the number of graduates who enter the finance and consulting fields was one of the main drivers of the record salary results for the class of 2019, according to Associate Dean for McDonough Career Services Doreen Amorosa (MSB ’79).
“While salaries in most MBA industry sectors rose year over year, Consulting and Financial Services recorded the highest gains of all industries and currently are our most highly paid sectors,” Amorosa wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This year, these industries hired 62% of the class, where last year the combined total was 47%.”
Bloomberg rankings’ methodology uses statistics based on surveys of alumni, students and corporate recruiters, in addition to employment data provided by universities. The MSB’s higher rankings demonstrate the school’s innovative approach to teaching, according to Senior Associate Dean for MBA Programs Prashant Malaviya.
“Recent enhancements to the curriculum — from our new Leading Teams for Performance and Impact core course to new electives in the areas of analytics and data visualization — are reflected in the Bloomberg results,” Malaviya said in a news release. “Our continued recruitment successes also validate that the Georgetown MBA is valued by employers around the world.”
Starting last year, Bloomberg began using a new methodology for its rankings that measures schools across four categories: compensation, learning, networking and entrepreneurship. The MSB saw its biggest gain in the learning category from last year to this year, moving up to 15th place from 28th place. The school ranked 20th for compensation, 18th for networking and 30th for entrepreneurship in 2019
In a separate 2018 survey of employers released this spring, Bloomberg ranked the MSB first in the world for having the best prepared MBA graduates for the workplace. 
The career advising support for students at Georgetown as well as the school’s strong alumni network are both factors that lead to these statistics, according to Associate Dean of MBA programs Kerry Pace.
“We actively seek ways to support our MBA students and provide them opportunities for transformational growth both in and out of the classroom,” Pace wrote in an email to The Hoya. “All of these factors are critical in producing ethical business leaders that graduate ready to tackle the challenges of business and society.” 
MBA students who use the university’s career resources have the opportunity to create a personalized job search strategy that prioritizes their interests, according to Amorosa.
“This customized approach includes the creation of a career portfolio, the identification of a target industry & function, the creation of a target company list and a plan to access the employers on that list,” Amorosa wrote.
In recent years, the MSB has focused particularly on presenting MBA students with more opportunities to network and prepare for interviews to help them achieve their career goals, according to Amorosa.
Finding ways to adjust the curriculum to keep up with changes in the business world like new classes leads to the MBA program’s success, Pace wrote. The school’s new core course, “Leading Teams for Performance and Impact,” allows students to engage in case studies and team-building exercises to address social and workplace issues.
While higher rankings are encouraging, the increase is not as important as providing a quality education to MSB students, according to Pace.
“All of us at McDonough are proud to be considered a top-20 program,” Pace wrote. “It is exciting to see the rankings rise, but I am proud that increasing our ranking is not what motivates the faculty and staff at McDonough.”

Universities should provide institutionalized support to their students without documentation, panelists said at a Nov. 7 conference on Georgetown University’s campus organized ahead of Supreme Court hearings on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Many students without documentation rely on DACA, an immigration policy that allows some people who came to the country without documentation as children to receive a two-year period of deferred action from deportation, obtain work permits and attend college. The program, enacted by former President Barack Obama, was ended in 2017 by President Donald Trump, but the Supreme Court began hearing arguments on the legality of Trump’s decision Nov. 12. As of right now, current or former DACA recipients are still able to apply for renewals. 
Financial inequality, in addition to other roadblocks, prevents people without documentation from accessing higher education as easily as U.S. citizens. The disparity violates Article 26 of the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that higher education should be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit, according to Executive Director of Freedom University Laura Soltis.
“For people who are moving across borders, it’s important that they know that regardless of where they were born or what borders they cross, they have fundamental human rights by virtue of being human,” Soltis said. 
Freedom University, a school for students without documentation that provides tuition-free college preparation classes and scholarship assistance, was founded by a group of students without documentation, student allies, immigrant rights activists and four professors at the University of Georgia. The group’s formation came as a response to the 2010 decision by the Georgia Board of Regents to ban students without documentation from attending Georgia’s top five public universities or receiving in-state tuition, according to the university website.
Similar admissions bans have also been passed in Alabama and South Carolina, limiting students’ without documentation access to college, many of which have faced appeals. Because of these admissions bans, many DACA recipients hold work permits and jobs but are not able to receive higher education, according to Soltis.
“It has normalized a system where a whole population of young people of color can legally drive to their low wage jobs with their driver’s license and their work permit but still can be denied access to a higher education and the right to vote,” Soltis said. 
The conference, titled “Pursuits & Persistence: Undocumented Student Success in Higher Education,” was co-hosted by the Institute for the Study of International Migration, a multidisciplinary center that studies multiple dimensions of international migration, as well as by Georgetown’s Center for Multicultural Equity and Access. The panels for the conference in the Healey Family Student Center featured speakers from various universities who discussed the past, present and future of students without documentation in higher education.
Despite DACA’s uncertain fate, efforts across college campuses to support equal education, such as scholarships for first generation college students, can still work to improve students’ without documentation access to education, according to Arelis Palacios, associate director of the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access and associate director for Undocumented Student Services.
“My daily goal is to quite literally make sure that more students are able to access college, able to access educational opportunities beyond undergraduate,” Palacios said.
Georgetown has representatives from 17 different offices on campus who support students without documentation, according to the university website. The university also joined 18 other colleges and universities in signing an amicus brief expressing support for DACA on Oct. 7. The brief identified the contributions and diverse perspectives that DACA recipients bring to the university’s campus and includes the stories of three Georgetown students without documentation.
While Palacios acknowledges that the current system of support for students without documentation at Georgetown is not perfect, she says she hopes that more progress can be made if everyone works together.
“I do the work because I’m human, and I care about human dignity, and I care about what it means for us to do this work,” Palacios said. “We have to recognize that it’s about helping each other, and really, quite literally, engaging in different levels of community care and collective care to support each other.”

Promoting long-term sustainable practices at Georgetown University requires determining community members’ roles in enhancing environmental consciousness, panelists said at a Nov. 14 event. 
The event, titled “The Sustainable Hoya: On Campus and Beyond,” was sponsored by Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room. Panelists assessed the current generation’s progress addressing climate change and systemic environmental issues. 
The panelists included Krystle Corpuz (SFS ’09), a program manager at international development firm Chemonics International; Charlotte Dreizen (GRD ’22), an analyst at the Office of Waste Diversion in the Washington D.C. Department of Public Works; Shanika Whitehurst (GRD ’05), the environmental justice coordinator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Greg Burton, the associate director of the Office of Planning and Facilities Management; and Peter Marra, the director of the Georgetown Environmental Initiative. 
Individual participation and advocacy are necessary to create a sustainable campus environment, according to Giulia Manno, the program and metrics manager at the Georgetown Office of Sustainability.
“I guess first of all I would say that collective individual actions do make a difference,” Manno said. “Whenever everybody is doing the same actions and you have shared values, that’s where culture change comes.”
The Office of Sustainability was established in 2013 as a branch of the Office of Planning and Facilities Management. The Office of Sustainability has contributed to the bee-friendly campus initiative and the residential compost program, among other projects. 
Since creating the Office of Sustainability, Georgetown has made caring for the environment a priority, Corpuz said. 
“Back in the day, there was no Office of Sustainability,” Corpuz said. “You guys are lucky because there was definitely a need back then for that sort of vision for the university and I’m glad Georgetown has adopted that view as the years progressed after I graduated.”
Helping people understand their personal relationship with nature by spending more time interacting with their surroundings can bring urgency to sustainability issues, according to Marra. 
“Most people don’t feel like they’re a part of nature,” Marra said. “They feel like they are completely detached. The more we can talk about people’s relationship to nature and the more we can get people out into nature, the better off we’re going to be.”
An internship in the Philippines informed the way that Corpuz thinks about sustainability, she said. Although participating in tangible environmental preservation efforts is important, activists should consider how initiatives will impact communities. 
“Being exposed to that sort of conservation language through my internship was really important,” Corpuz said. “It wasn’t really necessarily sustainability in terms of not using plastic straws or reducing usage of plastic bags or anything, but it was more focused on how do we give communities.” 
The event was moderated by Nareg Kuyumjian (SFS ’21), co-coordinator of Project Green First Year, a Laudato Si’ Fund recipient. The event included university, federal and local government perspectives to spotlight the diversity sustainable solutions, according to Kuyumjian.
“Sustainability is something that can’t be thought of in a box, so it was really intentional to have people from federal government, D.C. government, and then people affiliated with the Georgetown system more directly,” Kuyumjian said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The Office of Sustainability’s Laudato Si’ fund granted a total of $300,000 dollars to 11 different projects in September, ranging from projects to incorporate sustainability education into curriculum to environmental research projects. The grant also funded “Design Transfigured,” a sustainable fashion project, and “Disability, Disaster and Climate Change: A Public Ethics Project.” 
The panel encouraged community members to prioritize daily environmentally friendly choices, according to Kuyumjian.   
“I think what came out of it was ideas about how sustainability comes up in our daily lives in different settings and a realization that if we’re serious about a greener future, we can’t be afraid about making concrete changes, whether that be light switches or changing infrastructure,” Kuyumjian said.

Four hundred thousand U.S. children lost their health insurance from 2016 to 2018, pushing the total number of uninsured children to over four million, according to a report published by the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute’s Center for Children and Families.
For the second year in a row, the total number of uninsured children increased, according to the CCF’s report, which has been released annually for nine years. CCF Senior Research Associate Lauren Roygardner and CCF Executive Director Joan Alker co-authored the report. 
The increase in uninsured children in 2018 was unsurprising following the previous increase in 2017, according to Roygardner.
“Unfortunately, I was not very surprised by the findings, since our center has been monitoring uninsured rates for many years,” Roygardner said in an interview with The Hoya. “Last year, we saw a national increase in the child uninsured rate, and so this year we were closely monitoring children losing their coverage.”
The report found that uninsured children from low- and moderate-income families who earn between 138% or 250% of the federal poverty threshold suffered the largest rate increase. Losing health insurance was an issue most prevalent for children under the age of 6 and for white and Latino children, according to the report. 
The decrease in children’s healthcare coverage has implications for the growing wealth inequality gap, according to GlobeMed Georgetown Co-President Regina Woolridge (COL ’20). GlobeMed is a network composed of university students who partner with organizations to improve health outcomes for people living in poverty.
“[The report] also says a lot about the wealth gap,” Woolridge said in an interview with The Hoya. “Medical bills are one of the biggest contributors to debt in this country, and so not only does it show that the wealth inequality gap is growing, but also that it continues to grow as people who don’t have health insurance have to go into debt to pay medical bills.”
Health care insurance is not only necessary for medical emergencies, but also for yearly checkup appointments, according to Woolridge. Not attending yearly checkup appointments can have financial and educational impacts, Woolridge said. 
“It’s not only about what it means when they have an accident and their family has to take them to the hospital, but also about them not getting checkups as often, and what that will mean for their education and for their family’s financial security in general,” Woolridge said.
The Affordable Care Act allowed states to expand Medicaid coverage to uninsured adults and children with household incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. The federal poverty level was $21,330 for a family of three in 2019. States that expanded Medicaid coverage are called expansion states. 
The report found that 7.3% of children were uninsured in states that did not expand coverage compared to 3.8% of uninsured children in states that did. The large difference in health insurance coverage of children in nonexpansion versus expansion states was shocking, according to Roygardner. 
“Typically we do understand that the child uninsured rate in nonexpansion states is much higher than in the states that expanded, but I was shocked at the extent to which that disparity was,” Roygardner said.
Approximately half of uninsured children in the United States live in Texas, Florida, California, Georgia, Arizona and Ohio, according to the report. 
“While 39 percent of the nation’s children live in the South, 53 percent of uninsured children do,” the report stated. “No other region of the country has a larger share of uninsured children relative to their overall number of children.”
In order to decrease the number of uninsured children, states must find solutions tailored to their uninsured population’s needs, according to Roygardner.
“Probably a lot would have to happen for things to change, so I do think that if things kind of remain as they are, we are likely to continue to see a lot of uninsured kids,” Roygardner said. “Every state has different nuances, and so given that complexity, in order to change in the right direction and get more kids covered, it’s sort of state-by-state.”
In light of the report’s results, people can be active in their communities to learn about health disparities and support health equity, according to Woolridge.  
“We should all be working towards, in whatever our fields are, an equitable world where people have human rights — and health is a human right,” Woolridge said. “I think getting involved and educating yourself is important. We have this power and we should use it towards making the world a better place.”

A group of Georgetown residents expressed doubt that the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal can accommodate the increased traffic the National Park Service’s preferred canal revitalization plan could bring to the area at a Nov. 7 town hall. 
Georgetown Heritage, a nonprofit working with the Georgetown Business Improvement District on canal efforts, and NPS representatives presented photos of the recently completed renovations on locks 3 and 4 before breaking down the two alternative plans for future renovations. The locks can individually raise and lower boats eight feet to ease major changes in elevation, according to the C&O Canal Trust.
Some residents who own homes nearby, especially those near the site for the planned event space, have expressed strong opposition to the renovation’s updates. Twenty-five residents of James Place, a condominium adjacent to the canal, responded to the plans by presenting a “Neighbors’ Opposition to C&O Plan” letter at the town hall. 
The residents said the area suffers from a lack of parking spaces for buses and cars and is ill-prepared to accommodate the increase in foot traffic that a revitalized canal would bring. Many also feel that the updated look of the proposed designs is unfaithful to the C&O Canal National Historical Park’s origins and the feelings it has inspired in its long history, according to the letter.
The first plan, which the NPS prefers, proposes widening and paving pathways, increasing bridge accessibility and adding lighting and native plants to stabilize the banks. The other plan, called the “no-action alternative,” extends current management operations and demonstrates how implementing the action alternative would affect the surrounding environment. 
Thursday’s town hall addressed the canal’s accessibility issues, particularly concerns with the thin towpath that runs down its length. Currently, there are few access points for wheelchairs along the path, and most sections do not pass modern accessibility standards, being far too steep, thin or improperly maintained for handicapped visitors. 
The project seeks to update the path while preserving its original feel, according to Maggie Downing, director of public programs and partnerships at Georgetown Heritage.
“The towpath is historically this very narrow and confined space and is the primary way we experience the canal. That’s why our plans mainly focus on maintaining that — that sense of narrowness,” she said in an interview with The Hoya. “Today, walking the towpath can be really special and magical, but there are places where it can be kind of unsafe and not comfortable to walk on. So, we are really trying to find a way to strike that balance.”
Downing said the first plan — which was designed by the landscape architecture firm behind New York’s High Line — involves adding new bridges, viewing platforms and spaces for musical events and field trips. One area will feature a map of the entire canal cut into grass and a miniature functioning canal lock for use with school groups, and historic mule-towed canal boats will return to the canal to offer rides for tourists. 
Georgetown Heritage and the NPS value residents’ feedback, especially those closest to the canal, according to Downing.
“It’s part of the reason why we’re doing a community engagement process. We want the feedback, we want to make sure that we’re listening,” Downing said. “We realize that for many, this is a personal matter.”
Funding for the canal project will come from federal funds through the NPS; local offices, such as the District of Columbia Executive Office of the Mayor and Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development, the Georgetown Business Improvement District and donations.
The city believes making the canal accessible is important, according to D.C. Office of Planning Director Andrew Trueblood.
“The District provided matching funding for some of the work completed and underway,” Trueblood wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The broader proposal aligns with our values of accessibility and inclusion and will allow more people to experience and celebrate this national park.”
If the updated design is pursued, the project should be completed in fall 2020.

UNICEF-Georgetown hosted the 17th annual International Children’s Development Conference on Nov. 10, which focused on the effect of gang violence on the migration of children from Latin and Central America to the United States. 
This year’s conference aimed to bring awareness to the narratives of Latin and Central American children, who often are targeted by gangs in their home countries and led to immigrate to the United States to escape violence, according to UNICEF-Georgetown Co-President Joy Yue (SFS ’21).  
“People rarely address how these issues’ negative impacts disproportionately affect children and youth, especially in the Central and Latin American region, where many children are purposefully targeted by/recruited into gangs and as a result seek to migrate to the US to escape from violence and reunite with family,” Yue wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The first of two panels at the conference featured discussion around advocacy and policy work on the effect of gang violence, including a conversation on family separations and legal advocacy for unaccompanied children. The second panel included discourse on the immigrant journeys of panelists Juan Pacheco, director of the community development coalition Barrios Unidos DMV, and Elizabeth Guzman (D), a member of Virginia’s House of Delegates, to showcase the diversity of experiences of immigrants moving to the United States.
The conference comes after the recent migrant caravan, a group of thousands of migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador who in late 2018 traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border to escape poverty and violence. Migrant children who reached the U.S.-Mexico border were held in poor living conditions and often separated from their families, according to The New York Times. 
The UNICEF-Georgetown board chose the focus for this year’s conference in light of the migrant caravan and the poor treatment of children at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to Yue. 
“A significant number of children were among the caravan, vulnerable to the instabilities along the journey,” Yue wrote. “Therefore the Board approved this topic because we thought it was timely, relevant, and urgent for us to address.”
The first panel on advocacy and policy work featured Miriam Abaya, a policy associate at the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, Mark Engman, managing director of policy and advocacy at UNICEF USA, and David Murphey, director of the ChildTrends Data Bank. 
In addition to the other obstacles immigrant youth face in their journey to the United States, migrant children face obstacles in accessing mental health resources to address traumatic life experiences, which can lead them to be more vulnerable to gang recruitment, according to Abaya. 
“They’ve suffered trauma in their home country before they left on their journey to the United States, and some of them have now suffered trauma at the hands of our government,” Abaya said during the panel. “They’re going back to communities that don’t have the mental health support in order to help them recover from that trauma. All of that can make kids more vulnerable, of course, to gang violence and gang recruitment.” 
Competing political narratives on immigration prevent effective policy solutions to the issue of gang violence for young immigrants, according to Engman. To adequately protect migrant children’s rights, politicians must work to depolarize rhetoric and address concerns about immigration, according to Engman.
“We have competing narratives that are preventing us from coming to solutions, and it’s global,” Engman said. “We have to get away from heated rhetoric and really talk about the issues and the fears that people have and how we can address those fears while still protecting children’s rights.” 
Alongside the struggles and hardships they have faced throughout their immigration, each migrant child’s experience contributes to American culture through the diverse narratives and perspectives each individual brings to the United States, according to Murphey.
“We have to move beyond stereotyping and generalizations and understand that there are all kinds of stories behind every immigrant child or family member that comes to this country,” Murphey said in an interview with The Hoya. “They’re not all the same, but those who do come often have remarkable stories of resilience, survival and they bring those assets to our culture — if they simply make it here — and they contribute enormously to society.” 
The advocacy work of the panelists showcased the progress being made toward helping individuals impacted by violence and immigration obstacles, according to Yue.
“Moreover, by inviting a full panel of experts and practitioners on the issue, we also want to give hope to our community by emphasizing that this challenge may not be going away anytime soon, but we are lucky enough to have advocates who are passionate about engaging with these issues and working towards making meaningful positive change,” Yue wrote.

U.S. National Parks conservation efforts must negotiate the tension between expanding visitation as well as environmental and cultural preservation, panelists said at an event Nov. 13. 
The event, titled “Social Justice in the World of Conservation,” was sponsored by Georgetown University Outdoor Education and the Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network in the Walsh Building on Wednesday. Panelists examined both the importance and obstacles surrounding the improvement of national parks in the event, which was moderated by Randall Amster, co-director of the Georgetown College Environmental Studies Program.
Discussions around the history of national parks have always sparked debate about beliefs about land ownership and control, according to panelist James Olsen, a Georgetown philosophy and environmental ethics professor. 
“When we talk about these sites of land, when we talk about the history, the histories are complex,” Olsen said at the panel. “They are battlegrounds and they have been battlegrounds, but they are are not just battles over, sort of, the land itself and who controls it, but these are battles of ideas and these are battles of values.”
Other panelists at the event included Bette Jacobs, a Georgetown health systems administration professor and a member of the Cherokee Nation, and Ani Kame’enui, the deputy vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association, an advocacy organization that seeks to protect and enhance America’s national park system. 
In recent years, the National Park System has increased park visits amid government funding cutbacks. Between 2011 and 2017, visitation at National Parks increased by 19%, but the parks also faced an 11% reduction in staff, according to the NPCA. In 2018, the National Park Service logged 318,211,833 visits. 
Although increased funding for National Park services might encourage more travelers to visit, more visitors engaging with the parks carries potentially negative consequences for the park’s flora and fauna, according to Olsen. 
“If we increase the resources that are going to the national park service and we hired more instead of cutting jobs and all of this, the more you visit, of course, the higher the ecological impact,” Olsen said. 
Marginalized groups are often underrepresented in National Park visitation. In 2016, black people made up about 7% of national park visitors despite constituting 13% of the nation’s population, according to National Geographic. The Latinx and Native American communities were also underrepresented. 
When considering the future of national parks, it is important to consider the financial difficulty many communities face in accessing the locations, according to Kame’enui. 
“I think one of the challenges we face in considering the recipe of conserving and engaging with nature is one of access,” Kame’enui said. “The park system, by and large, is designed for rich white people, so if we want to talk about conserving and preserving these spaces, it is going to mean limiting access and limiting populations, which goes against the grain of a movement toward a more inclusive park system.” 
To encourage visitation and to celebrate the National Park Service’s 100th anniversary in 2016, the organization launched a “Find Your Park” initiative, in which prospective visitors can take an online quiz to determine which parks would best suit their preferences and interests.
However, some parks pushed back against the initiative, arguing an uptick in visitation can put a heavy strain on the parks’ operations and natural ecology, according to Kame’enui. 
“By the end of 2016, parks like Rocky Mountain were saying, ‘find a different park,’” Kame’enui said. “How do you balance an increasing interest in visiting our national parks with the fact that we institutionally are not adequately funding them?”
In 1872, when the American government sought to create the first national park, Yellowstone National Park, new settlers displaced several Native American tribal nations, according to TIME. Since this first park’s creation, the government has overseen the displacement of several other Native American tribes to develop national parks, such as Yosemite National Park.
Native American groups have engaged in discussion with the federal government to discuss their present-day relationship with the national parks and the preservation of culturally significant sites within the locations, according to Jacobs. 
“It is a very complex intertwined story as to how we have come to be here. There are definitely places that are sacred that we view with reverence in awe,” Jacobs said. “But there are smaller, quieter places that evoke and are sacred for a lot of different reasons — those are all places of identity.”

Georgetown University professor Ananya Chakravarti launched a community archiving initiative Nov. 8 to preserve the history of U Street NW, a Washington, D.C. neighborhood that was historically a cultural hub for black people in the District.
Chakravarti, who is a resident of the U Street corridor in Northwest D.C., launched the Remembering YoU initiative to both preserve U Street’s rich history and empower residents of gentrified communities to take ownership of their past, according to the initiative’s website. The project is sponsored by the Georgetown University Humanities Initiative, which promotes academic research in the humanities on campus, and HumanitiesDC, a D.C.-based nonprofit that funds public humanities programming. The initiative was first launched at the Community Archiving fair Nov. 8 to 9.
Chakravarti’s team, composed of Georgetown and Howard University undergraduate students, community members and history experts, will attempt to digitize U Street’s history for the project. The team plans to digitize photographs, information, audio and any other artifacts that might serve to connect modern U Street to its past.
The project’s mission to combat gentrification resonated with Sonali Mirpuri (COL ’20), a history research assistant for the project, who personally identified with the project’s goals.
“I am originally from a town outside of New Orleans, an area that is also a victim to rapid gentrification,” Mirpuri wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The aim and purpose of the project made me excited to get involved, as this is a topic I am grappling with in my own experience.”
U Street is also known as “Black Broadway” because it was a neighborhood where black people were free to own businesses during the first half of the 21st century when Jim Crow laws restricted their ability to own enterprises in other parts of D.C., according to The Washington Post.
When Chakravarti moved to the U Street neighborhood from Egypt four years ago, she was surprised to learn that the area currently has many chain restaurants and stores and only a few remaining black-owned businesses.
“I was amazed — especially because I work in Georgetown, a historic neighborhood where everything is so preserved — that what I saw on U Street was this unchecked erasure,” Chakravarti said in an interview with The Washington Post.
The Community Archiving fair on U Street, which Mirpuri helped organize, included performances, exhibits and events about the U Street corridor’s impact on history, art, music and science. The U Street restaurant Ben’s Chili Bowl served its iconic half-smoke sausage meal and hosted a walking tour of the neighborhood. Historical preservation initiatives at the event included a data visualization workshop led by HumanitiesDC and an audio booth for participants with a personal connection to the area to record their oral histories. 
The project will use digital technologies such as augmented reality, a mobile app and QR codes to preserve the history of the neighborhood and aims to prevent further erasure of the area’s past, according to the project website.
“In communities vulnerable to gentrification, new digital technologies can democratize historical preservation and allow communities to retain control over the narratives shaping their own histories and neighborhoods,” the website reads.
The Community Archiving fair also gave participants the opportunity to participate in Remembering YoU’s initiative for digitization. Attendees were encouraged to bring in textual and visual artifacts relating to the history of the neighborhood that they wanted to be digitized.
The project features a creative use of technology to benefit an entire community, according to Miranda Liu (COL ’23), who is also a member of the project team.
“The project was extremely interesting to me because it was such a unique application of computer science,” Liu wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Not only would I be assisting in the creation of a digital archive, something I have never done before, and exploring new concepts, such as augmented reality, I would be helping out a whole community of people.”
Liu created posters hung around the U Street neighborhood with QR codes that allowed people to see different snapshots of the historical area. The QR codes were the initial step in creating a mobile app that Chakravarti’s team is developing to help visitors visualize U Street’s history, according to Liu.
While this weekend was a critical first step for the project, the initiative has more plans to engage with the social issues in the community, according to Mirpuri.
“This launch was just the first in a series of follow-ups to combat gentrification in the U St. neighborhood,” Mirpuri wrote. “This weekend hopefully demonstrated to the community how serious we are about tackling this issue and how we cannot face it without support from the community.”

HoyaTHON nearly doubled its fundraising total at its second annual dance marathon Nov. 9, raising money for Washington, D.C.’s local Children’s Miracle Network Hospital. 
HoyaTHON, Georgetown University’s chapter of the Miracle Network Dance Marathon, raised more than $73,584 overall, nearly double the $41,024 raised last year. The funds will all go to Children’s National, a hospital in Washington, D.C. Children’s National is one of 170 Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals that provide health care to pediatric patients across the United States and Canada. The network supports fundraising and awareness campaigns, including dance marathons, for the hospitals. 
Students who participated in hoyaTHON remained standing — and often dancing — for 12 hours Saturday to raise money, according to Daniela Toste (NHS ’21), director of Family Relations on the hoyaTHON Executive Board. 
“You stand on your feet the entire time to fight for the kids who can not,” Toste wrote in a statement to The Hoya. 
Participating students signed up online and collected donations from family, friends and other sponsors via a personal fundraising page. HoyaTHON also raised money through group fundraising efforts with student organizations like Students of Georgetown, Inc., commonly referred to as The Corp, and the Georgetown University Farmers’ Market. 
Co-Directors Callia Karas (COL ’20) and Hanna Dohmen (SFS ’20) launched the campus chapter last year to engage the Georgetown community in a fun, charitable initiative, Dohmen said. The December 2018 dance marathon set its goal at $20,000 but doubled the amount by raising over $41,000. 
“We started this because we saw how impactful this is in other communities and other campuses,” Dohmen said. “The whole point of the dance marathon is to bring an entire community together for the same cause.”
The funds raised will go toward the Fund for Every Child, a Children’s Miracle National Network program dedicated to helping treat children with quality care, according to Hank Rich, assistant director of Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals.
“The Fund for Every Child helps to ensure that every child, from every background and every walk of life, can receive exceptional care, regardless of insurance or ability to pay,” Rich wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Georgetown’s event is one of 400 Children’s Miracle Network dance marathons throughout the country. Holding hoyaTHON in November broke with the majority of other universities’ fundraising strategies. Most universities hold dance marathons in the spring, allowing organizers more time to recruit and plan the hours-long event, according to Dohmen.
On the day of the event, 293 students had registered to be a part of this year’s dance marathon, which coincidentally matched the exact number of children staying at Children’s National, according to Dohmen.
“There were 293 kids at the hospital that had spent the night at the hospital that night, and the day of, that morning, when we woke up, we had 293 people registered,” Dohmen said. “Just realizing that every person registered represented one kid at the hospital who spent the night there, like, I had tears running down my face.”
By the time the event started Saturday in the Healey Family Student Center, however, 344 students had registered for the event, which was 101 more participants than last year, Dohmen said. 
Registrants could participate in 12 hours of dancing, including a morale dance that participants learned throughout the event, as well as games and food, according to Toste. Children’s National parents and patients, known as “miracle families” by organizers, joined Georgetown students to perform, deliver speeches and spend time with participants. 
“I loved being able to meet and play games with the miracle families that attended this year,” Toste said. “They were so fun and did extremely well with their speeches and performances.”
Throughout the day, student organizations like a cappella group Saxatones and dance troupe Groove Theory entertained participants. Performing was an opportunity to help an important cause, according to Groove Theory dancer Annmarie Rotatori (COL ’23). 
“We were very happy to play a role in supporting hoyaTHON and Children’s National,” Rotatori wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “It was really fun to perform with my team for such a great cause!”
Although this is the second year of hoyaTHON in its current iteration, 2018 was not the first time a dance marathon was held at Georgetown. The most recent dance marathon prior to last year’s event was held in 2010 and raised about $8,500 for Children’s National. After that, the chapter ceased fundraising until Dohmen and Karas revived the dance marathon.  
Dohmen is optimistic that hoyaTHON will continue after she and Karas graduate because of the dance marathon’s fundraising success. 
“Just kind of hearing that people are talking about it and are excited about it, that to me makes me feel like it will continue on without us here,” Dohmen said.

The Daughters of the American Revolution hosted a garden party at the Old Stone House on Nov. 9 to educate the community about renovations underway at the historic building’s garden. 
The house at 3051 M St. NW, which was renovated last year, is the oldest structure on its original foundation in Washington, D.C., according to the National Park Service, which maintains the house. The recent renovations focus on the garden attached to the house and include painting the garden’s fence and rose trellises and installing educational signs and a new bench, among other updates. The fence was painted Oct. 12, and dogwood trees will be planted in the garden Dec. 9, according to Stephanie Green, regent of the DAR’s Constitution Chapter. Renovations should be fully completed by May 2020, Green wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Built in 1765 by a colonial cabinetmaker, the house has served as a retail store for various products and was opened to the public in 1960. The NPS cultivated the English garden that stretches behind the structure from M Street. 
The planning for the renovation project began this summer. The president of Friends of Rose Park, David Dunning, reached out to DAR to create a partnership with the group on the renovations, according to Green. DAR, a nationwide group for female descendants of those active in achieving American independence, focuses on historic preservation in its work, according to its website. 
DAR decided to contribute to the Old Stone House garden renovation because of the group’s commitment to maintaining historical sites, according to Green. 
“Mr. Dunning made me aware of the garden’s needs this summer. As a leader of an organization dedicated to conservation and historic preservation, I thought it would be a perfect project for our chapter,” Green wrote.
Dunning is working to create a preservation organization for the property called Patrons of the Old Stone House, according to Green. 
The house has partly survived this long because of a robust canon of legends. Some residents believed that the Old Stone House was the site of Fountain Inn, also known as Suter’s Tavern, where President George Washington and urban planner Pierre L’Enfant met to plan D.C.’s layout in 1791. However, historians now believe Suter’s Tavern was really located at the corner of 31st and K streets.
Suter’s Tavern was run by John Suter, whose son was a clockmaker named John Suter. The younger John Suter lived in the Old Stone House and used it as his clockmaking shop. The connection led to confusion about the true site of Suter’s Tavern.
The Old Stone House’s garden is an unexpected use of space that the community should further utilize, according to Georgetown Business Improvement District spokesperson Lauren Boston.
“Despite being on a bustling stretch of M Street, the gardens are tucked away behind the Old Stone House and have always offered a little urban oasis,” Lauren Boston wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s important that Georgetown maintains these unexpected pockets of green space, in addition to larger areas like Georgetown Waterfront Park, and it’s great that the garden — and those who frequent it — will benefit from these improvements.”
NPS completed renovations to the house itself last year. The house closed in November 2017 for repairs to the building’s exterior stonework and foundation as well as its plumbing, electrical, HVAC and fire suppression systems.
Renovations will benefit visitors now and in the future, according to Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Commissioner Matias Burdman (COL ’21).
“The Old Stone House serves as an everyday reminder of our neighborhood’s historic roots and of the fact that we live in one of the nation’s first National Historic Landmarks,” Burdman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As for the garden improvements, they will improve the visitor experience while staying true to the National Park Service’s mission of historic preservation.”

Nine members of the Council of the District of Columbia are calling for the resignation of Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), after the release of a report Nov. 4 detailing 11 ethics violations by the councilmember since 2014. 
The council retained the law firm O’Melveny and Myers to independently investigate Evans, the District’s longest serving councilmember, and ultimately compile the report. Evans has been accused of corruption in using his council position to promote the interests of clients of his consulting company since the spring of 2018. He is also the subject of a federal investigation, which led to the FBI raiding his Georgetown home in June. 
Evans declined to comment for this story. 
After the release of the report, a majority of Evans’ colleagues on the council swiftly condemned the wrongdoings described in the document and called for his resignation. Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) was one of the first councilmembers to call for Evans’ resignation Nov. 5, with seven of his colleagues joining him that day. Evans has lost the trust of his constituents, according to Allen.
“I believe the findings demonstrate a deliberate intent to personally profit from his elected office and represent a pattern of breaching public trust that cannot be repaired. This process has wasted too much time, money, and trust, and it is time he resign,” Allen wrote in an email to The Hoya. “With the investigative report’s findings now complete, I believe it is in the best interest of the District of Columbia that Councilmember Evans step down and allow for a special election to provide the residents of Ward 2 an opportunity for new leadership and representation.”
Prior to the more recent calls for resignation, Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large), who recently announced he will not run for reelection in 2020, was the first councilmember to call for Evans’ resignation back in July. Grosso expressed frustration at the council’s lack of disciplinary action concerning Evans in a July 8 news release. 
“I believe the public trust in Councilmember Evans is irreparable and it is in the best interest of the Council and the residents of the District of Columbia that Jack Evans resign as the Ward 2 Councilmember,” Grosso said in the news release. “This is an unfortunate situation of our own making. The Council failed to address the allegations of Councilmember Evans’ corruption, conflicts of interest, and misconduct when they first surfaced in early 2018.” 
Evans’ district, Ward 2, includes the Georgetown neighborhood and main campus. While Georgetown University College Democrats will not take a position on the Ward 2 election race, the group condemned Evans’ actions as unethical and also called for his resignation, according to GUCD Chair Rebecca Hollister (COL ’21). 
“GUCD is not taking a position in the Ward 2 election race. However, we too condemn Jack Evans’ unethical actions and agree with the calls for his resignation. We deserve to be represented by someone who at the very least can comply with basic ethical rules,” Hollister wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is clear from the overwhelming evidence that Jack Evans does not respect the office he holds. Ward 2 deserves better representation, including Georgetown students.” 
The calls for Evans’ resignation are not unanimous among his colleagues. Councilmember Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7) will decline to call for a resignation until the investigative process is complete. Evans still deserves due process, according to Gray, a former D.C. mayor who came under investigation for illegally financing his 2010 campaign but was never charged.
“I have profound concerns about the conduct of Councilmember Evans, following the release of the O’Melveny & Myers LLP report. I encourage Councilmember Evans to consider what is best for the residents of Ward 2, his family and himself,” Gray wrote in an email to The Hoya. “However, I will not be calling for Councilmember Evans’ resignation at this time. I firmly believe in due process and can appreciate better than most what it feels like to not be afforded that.” 
If Evans is proven guilty, he should resign, according to Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Commissioner Matias Burdman (COL ’21). 
“Although Councilmember Evans has done a lot for the city over his years in office, the allegations against him are extremely serious,” Burdman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Should they be proven to be true, he should step down.”

Georgetown University veterans and active-duty service members operate at the intersection of Jesuit values and military service, retired U.S. Army Col. Miguel Howe (GRD ’04) said in his keynote speech for this year’s Veterans Day celebrations at the university’s annual ceremony Nov. 11.
The celebration allowed members of the Georgetown community to observe Veterans Day with prayer, a variety of speakers, traditional ceremonies and music. Hosted by the Office of the President, the ceremony included addresses by Howe, Georgetown University Student Veterans Association President Timothy Brown and University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95). 
At the ceremony, DeGioia shared his gratitude to different organizations that aim to support the Georgetown veteran community, including the Veterans Office and GUSVA. DeGioia commended the veterans and active-duty members of the Georgetown community for the lasting impact of their service.
“Your integrity, respect, imagination, passion, service, resilience, the discipline and hard work that so many of you have demonstrated by returning to school after military service, even balancing the demands of both school and active-duty service, shows great sacrifice, strength of character and depth of leadership,” DeGioia said.
The Georgetown community invests in veterans’ programs and education on campus through career counseling and financial support, allowing veterans in the community to meet their academic needs and maximize their possibilities, according to Howe.
“Thank you for not only being here today to honor our veterans but, more importantly, thank you for your cura personalis for our veterans,” Howe said. “For ensuring that Georgetown sees the gifts and challenges, needs and possibilities, of the men and women who once wore our nation’s cloth.”
In his speech, Howe emphasized the existence of many active-duty military students, student veterans and military families at Georgetown and acknowledged Brown’s leadership on campus and commitment to supporting veterans. 
The ceremony began with a posting of the colors by Georgetown’s ROTC Color Guard, followed by a performance of the national anthem sung by the Georgetown Chimes, the university’s oldest all-male a capella group.
Following their speeches, Brown and DeGioia presented Howe with the flag that had flown on the flagpole on Copley Lawn since last year’s Veterans Day ceremony, as per GUSVA’s tradition of gifting the flag to each year’s keynote speaker.
“The flag that President DeGioia and I just presented to Colonel Howe spent the last year flying across the Georgetown campus, and it represents the passing of all cumulative knowledge gained by veterans on these grounds this year,” Brown said. 
The Hoya Battalion, a group of student cadets from five different Washington, D.C.-area universities, proceeded to raise a new flag, which hit the top of the post just as the Healy Hall bells rang out.
Just after the flag was raised, Javon Price (SFS ’21), reserver at Joint Base Andrews, cadet and Air Force ROTC member, stood up and sang the lyrics of the Armed Forces Medley with pride. Many veterans and other audience members began to follow in his example, standing and singing when their respective army division’s song began to play.
Singing during the medley honored the three core values of the Air Force: integrity, service to others and excellence, according to Price.
“Part of it was intuition, and part of it was pride,” Price said in an interview with The Hoya. “I’m proud to serve, and the very least I could do was sing the song. I thought it was a cool way to embody all three core values that we have in the Air Force.”
Following the ceremony, DeGioia hosted a reception in Riggs Library for veterans, the Veterans Office workers, staff, students and faculty, many of whom shared stories of their own service and the service of others. 
The Veterans Day celebration is just one of the many activities the Veterans Office is organizing for this November’s Military-Connected Awareness Month. The office will also host events such as a “Veterans in Government” panel Nov. 14, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ GI Bill School Tour on Nov. 15, the Ruggles Lecture in Military Medicine on Nov. 18 and the VET Ally 2.0: Addressing the Veteran Identity event Nov. 19.  
Veterans Day observances should be primarily celebrating the contributions of current, past and future service members, according to Alazar Zewoldi, Veterans of American University club president, who was in the U.S. Army from 2014 to 2018.
“Lots of people try to make Veterans Day solemn,” Zewoldi said in an interview with The Hoya. “Really, it should be a celebration of service for those serving, those who have served and those who will serve.”
