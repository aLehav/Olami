Students often complain about a lack of transparency in the administration, but one of the greatest powers behind decisions of the university is even more unknown. Behind all of the changes taking place on a daily basis, the board of directors is at the helm of the latest initiatives at the university. Chris Pigott (COL ’12), student representative to the board of directors, current Georgetown University Student Association senator and former assistant speaker of GUSA, sat down with THE HOYA to discuss how the board is addressing these issues on campus.
Why did you join the board of directors, and what do you think is your role on the board?
I first decided to apply to join the board because I actually hadn’t heard about the position. After being involved in GUSA for a year and a half, I didn’t even know there was a student who sat on the board of directors.
I serve as a liaison, relaying student opinions and issues to the board. I think that my position should be more open and available to students. There are a lot of things that the board should know and things that the students can inform them about. The members of the board have been chosen as the most loyal Hoyas. They’re not just the biggest donors, but the people who had the best experiences while here. We want to replicate that experience for other students.
What are the duties of the board of directors?
The administration has more to do with the day-to-day upkeep of the university. The board of directors only meets four times a year, for only a couple of days, but they deal with serious issues. They deal a lot with the overhead. They hire the president, and send [University] President [Jack J.] DeGioia his paycheck.
In addition, one of the issues the board is really looking at right now is expanding the Public Policy Institute and possibly converting it into a college of the university [and] at some point as its own graduate school. They’re involved in that financially, in trying to attract a donor who would give his name to the school. They also like to keep track of the program, and they like to serve as a check to the authority of the
administration. The deans of all the schools have to make presentations to the board every meeting to discuss what has occurred in their colleges and what they hope to accomplish in the future.
How has the board of directors reacted to the recent security issues on campus?
There are certain issues that the board does not have any concern with or authority over. However, they do really want to know about those things. A big example of this is security. At the September meeting, the board was very concerned with how students felt, if they felt like there was a large enough presence of DPS officers. The meeting actually occurred before the string of burglaries in September, and the next meeting is going to occur in February. Even though they won’t have a major involvement in campus safety besides funding initiatives on safety, they are still very concerned with it.
What are some of the more visible powers of the board of directors?
There is a lot that the board does that’s tangible to students. The board, for instance, has to endorse any increase of the Student Activity Fee. Since increasing the fee is a large part of GUSA’s Student Activities Fee and Endowment reform, the board would have to officially endorse the increase before it could go into effect administratively. The money can’t move until the board signs off. Even if the referendum passes, no money will move until the beginning of the next school year, so we have until next fall to get everything passed. I presented the problem to them in September, and they were very receptive to the idea.
Is your position part of GUSA?
As the student representative to the board of directors, I am technically under the control of the Office of Student Affairs. I report to Todd Olson and meet with him before every board meeting to discuss whatever issues we want to share with the board. The position is appointed by GUSA, but does not fall under the control of GUSA.
What did the university address at the September meeting, besides safety and the Student Activity Fee?
The board was very interested with the development of the Public Policy Institute. They were looking forward to speaking with the new dean, Edward Montgomery. Also, the presentation of the Dean of the McDonough School of Business, Dean George Daly, was very important, as it was his last presentation to the board.
How transparent is the board of directors, and how is the organization trying to make itself more transparent?
I think that’s why there’s a student representative, to increase transparency. The board is not the most transparent organization in the university, but for good reason. The board doesn’t announce the timing of its meetings, or release any widely available minutes from their meeting. I’m OK with that, because they’re not trying to do anything overly controversial. They’re hosting presentations. In addition, there would be a lot of problems with making the timing of the meetings widely known. These are famous people on the board, such as Alonzo Mourning, who might be uncomfortable going to meetings that were publicly known.
What is the most visible effect of the board on the university currently?
Since I was appointed to the position four or five months ago, I haven’t seen the immediate effect of their actions. However, a lot of what we see around has come about because of the board. It was the decision of the board 20 or 30 years ago to push for the university to become one of the most elite universities in the nation. They’ve helped that development, both through finances and through effort and determination. I know that all the members of the board love Georgetown. They want to see the university flourish, and rise above its peer institutions. I think a lot of the overhead issues can’t be seen tangibly, but the strength and integrity of the university have been derived by the efforts of the board. The School of Foreign Service would not be the best graduate school in its field without the help of the board. They also have a major role in the expansion of the university. They help achieve the long-term goals of the university, not the 2010 Campus Plan, but 50 years down the road.

The Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center announced its support last week for the new, more graphic warning labels for cigarette packaging required by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
In a statement, the Lombardi Cancer Center outlined the immediate physical effects of carcinogens as the reason behind its support for the new packaging regulations. The regulations, effective June 22, 2011, will feature larger written warnings and images depicting the long-term health effects of smoking.
According to the statement, research has found that smoking a single cigarette enables the “activation of pathways involved in cell death, inflammation and other forms of systemic damage.”
This data complements other research that previously led the HHS and the Lombardi Center to advocate for stronger warnings on cigarette packages. According to the HHS, tobacco use is responsible for the most premature and preventable deaths in the United States, with 443,000 people dying because of tobacco use each year. About 1,200 smokers die each day due to their tobacco use.
The new packaging standards have been used in several foreign countries, including Uruguay and Singapore, for several years. The decision to implement these warnings reflects an international movement to control tobacco advertising and more fully outline the dangers of smoking. This week, 171 countries will gather to form an anti-smoking treaty.
Smokers have mixed feelings about the university’s level of tolerance for the habit. While some smokers feel that tobacco use is not well accommodated by the Office of Residence Life, Georgetown has never released official statements discouraging the practice of smoking apparent in their student body.
Approximately 12 percent of Georgetown’s student body smokes, according to Carol Day, director of health education Services. HES provides information about tobacco use to students through its website and also offers individual counseling resources to students who want to quit smoking, though very few students express interest, Day said.
On campus locations Hoya Snaxa and Vital Vittles sell cigarettes and chewing tobacco and occasionally offer discounts on tobacco products. Representatives of The Corp declined to comment on the sale of tobacco in its stores.
“I was surprised when I first saw cigarettes at Vittles and Snaxa, and even more so when I saw [chewing] dip there too,” Stephanie Welsh (NHS ’14) said. “It’s strange for any school, much less a Jesuit one, to make tobacco so easily accessible when it’s so big on promoting overall health for its students.”

Recounting the devastating floods in Pakistan this summer, Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, urged students gathered in the Mortara Center Monday to divert their attention to the ongoing disaster.
Haqqani said that the international response to last July’s floods in Pakistan has been abysmal.
“Pakistan has been unfortunate, and not only in terms of weather,” Haqqani said, beginning a sharp critique of both the media and the international donor community for mishandling the situation in
Pakistan.
With sometimes surprising candor, Haqqani argued that the international response has been lacking because the floods caused few actual deaths.
He said that the total number of people affected by the floods, however, numbers 20 million – more than the number affected by the Haitian earthquake, Indian Ocean tsunami and 2005 earthquake in Pakistan combined. At one time, 20 percent of Pakistan was underwater, an area the size of the entire Eastern seaboard.
“There are times when our compassion overwhelms our cynicism, and there are times when our cynicism overwhelms our compassion,” he said. “But there is something worse than cynicism at work here.”
Haqqani said that few media outlets actually sent reporters to the affected area, providing minimal and sometimes inaccurate accounts of the floods.
“A story like a flood can really only be told by getting your feet wet – literally,” he said.
Those who did cover the floods, Haqqani said, focused more on the political aspects of the story than anything else.
“What about the human tragedy? What about the suffering?” he asked.
Haqqani, who has spoken at other local universities recently, said he hoped students would help bring greater attention to the issue and convince the private sector to start donating to Pakistan.
“What I expect for them is the raising of awareness,” he said.
orial Shah (SFS ’13), who coordinated the event, said that increasing general knowledge about the floods was her primary goal. Shah was in Pakistan during the summer when the flooding began, and she spent three weeks on the ground with a nonprofit organization helping to coordinate disaster relief.
When she returned to campus in the fall, Shah helped found the GU Pakistan Flood Relief Task Force. Shah said that she was initially disheartened by the number of students who did not know about the flooding.
While promoting yesterday’s event, however, Shah noticed a dramatic change. Only one person she talked to didn’t know about the disaster, and strangers even helped her put up posters and said they were interested.
“That was very encouraging to me,” Shah said. She was especially happy to see greater involvement from people who had no previous connections to South Asia.
For Nick Albanese (SFS ’14), Haqqani’s lecture served as a chance to learn more about a crisis that he admitted he had not followed closely.
“I didn’t really know much about the situation in Pakistan,” Albanese said, adding that he found Haqqani’s perspective on the media most interesting.
ary Nancy Walter (COL ’14) said she had discussed the floods with Pakistani friends but wanted to hear the ambassador’s perspective.
For Shah, who grew up in rural Pakistan, the biggest concern is that people will begin to forget about the floods.
“People don’t feel the urgency anymore,” she said. “But I still feel the urgency.”
