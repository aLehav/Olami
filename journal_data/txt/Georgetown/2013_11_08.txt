MICHELLE XU/THE HOYAGraduate Student Organization President Sam Osea (GRD ’14)Graduate students employed by the university have spoken out in an effort to pressure the administration into fixing systemic problems with timely payment.
According to Sheila McMullan, associate dean for administration and finance, students first began to voice concern over pay delays for stipened work after the transition to a new payroll system last winter.
“The issues that we were having were on the hourly side mainly because when the data came over from the old payroll system, it didn’t come over in a complete way,” McMullan said.
Since then, administrators have worked to centralize the payroll system for students on stipend by shifting responsibility for entering stipend hours away from individual departments. The more centralized system put responsibility for all postgraduate stipend salaries onto two employees within McMullan’s office.
“It’s a heavy load, especially when you’re coming into the beginning of the semester,” McMullan said. “It’s a lot of hours to put in for those staff members, but it’s the only way we could control the data.”
Jordan Smith, a doctoral candidate in the Department of History, expressed frustration that he had yet to receive his monthly stipend due Nov. 1, though his previous check in September came a week early.
“The thing that is particularly frustrating is that there is no consistency, I’ve had to pick up checks at different places across campus, and there doesn’t seem to be any sense as to who I should ask about this,” Smith said.
As a result, Smith had to dip into savings to pay his rent this month.“The rent’s due on the first, and I didn’t have a check,” Smith said. “This is our paycheck, and I am sure whoever’s fault it is got their paycheck on time.”
Because the university does not offer summer stipends for research or teaching to post-graduates unlike several peer institutions, a majority of graduate students seek employment through the School of Continuing Studies during the summer.
Fourth-year doctoral candidate Jack Santucci experienced a delay in the remittance of his salary from working as a summer instructor for the SCS this past summer.
“Very succinctly, it takes a very long time to get paid, and that’s a particular problem for graduate students,” Santucci said. “You need the money.”
Santucci originally expected to be paid in biweekly intervals, but he did not get paid for several weeks.
“There’s a divergence between what somebody told me when I took the job and what actually happened,” Santucci said. “My contact in the SCS – when I agreed to take the job – told me I could expect my first payment at the end of the first week of teaching. Some time after that, payroll came up with a plan that said I’d receive it three weeks later, and it would be smaller.”
Associate Dean of the School of Continuing Studies Veronica Donahue was dismayed to learn of students experiencing pay delays while working with the SCS.
“We work to rectify the situations almost immediately if we can fix them. We do hire hundreds of students in the grand scheme of things, so we’re not happy unless everyone gets paid,” Donahue said.
Though the SCS transitioned to its new downtown campus this year, Donahue did not believe this restructuring was relevant to pay delays.
“The move downtown certainly didn’t impact our payroll processes. All of our processes are the same as main campus,” Donahue said.
A recent survey issued by the Graduate Student Organization, the representative body of postgraduates at Georgetown, sought to identify whether pay-delay issues were systemic across departments. The survey received several hundred responses from students representing a cross-section of post-graduate programs.
“We had some idea of who gets what, but if we’re going to focus our resources on advocating for some particular issue, we need to know what the most important thing and it appears it’s the timeliness of payments,” GSO Public Relations Officer Graham Cornwell (GRD ’16) said.
Utilizing momentum from his predecessor’s term in office, GSO President Sam Osea (COL ’12, GRD ’14) said that GSO would use the most recent survey results to analyze the extent of the pay issue before bringing it before the executive committee.
“This pay issue, we realized, is a campus-wide issue, but we wanted to evaluate to what extent,” Osea said. “If it becomes an ongoing thing, we’ll have the documentation to remember it. It serves as data that we can present to the committee.”
A cursory scan over survey results revealed that the issue is on students’ radar.
“I’ve glanced at a few. It does seem to be a concern. Whether it’s a demonstrated concern is yet to be seen,” Osea said.
Despite the complaints, McMullan is proud of the work that has been done to restructure the payroll system since last winter.
“This year has been a huge difference. There’s been some really great administrators dedicated to fixing it and UIS fixing some of the glitches,” McMullan said. “From the number of complaints we received in January of last year to this cycle are so much less.”

Georgetown was among more than 1000 nonprofit organizations that suffered significant asset losses due to unauthorized uses of funds, according to a Washington Post investigation published last week.
The Post’s report, which looked at tax forms from 2008 to 2012, has now prompted multiple federal investigations into whether these nonprofit organizations properly reported diversions, which are unauthorized uses of funds such as theft or embezzlement, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.
The Post specifically examined if nonprofits checked “yes” or “no” to having a significant diversion of assets on their tax forms. A diversion is considered significant if it exceeds $250,000 or 5 percent of the organization’s receipts or assets.
According to Georgetown’s 2011 federal financial disclosure form 990 for tax-exempt organizations, obtained by The Washington Post, an unspecified university administrator improperly “compensated herself approximately $390,000” from 2007 to 2010 for work relating to a university-sponsored conference. The compensation was done through an unknown bank account over which the administrator had signature authority.
The documents state that Georgetown immediately closed the bank account upon learning of its existence and transferred the balance to a university controlled and audited account. The university then entered into an agreement with the administrator, who repaid all the unapproved compensation, plus interest.
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said she could not disclose details due to confidential personnel issues.
“This investigation uncovered the additional compensation received by the administrator for work relating to the conference, so we followed internal procedures for disciplining the parties involved,” Pugh said.
Pugh would not disclose what those internal procedures were or if the administrator is still employed by the university. She said that Georgetown would expect to be contacted about a federal investigation, adding that the university has followed all proper procedures.
“The university investigated the situation and reported it through its normal governance procedures and made the appropriate disclosures on its IRS form 990,” Pugh said.
This most recent incident follows two previous cases of fraud at Georgetown.
Federal prosecutors accused Pedro Paulo dos Santos, who held various positions at Georgetown from 1998 to 2005, of falsifying documents, diverting funds and inventing a fictitious company in order to obtain more than 100 fraudulent checks totaling about $311,000 from October 2001 to January 2005. Santos served as associate director and program coordinator of the university’s Brazilian Studies Program from 2002 until his termination.
According to court records, dos Santos admitted to the theft when confronted by university auditors but fled to Brazil the following day, where he remains at large.
Additionally, former Georgetown University Medical Center administrator Adriana Santamaria was sentenced to 20 months in federal prison for stealing more than $350,000 from Georgetown from 1995 to 2002. Because Santamaria had stolen federal grant funds, which include overhead costs not associated with any individual program, Georgetown was forced to repay over $500,000 to the federal government.
Although university officials stated then that they had implemented new safeguards to prevent this type of theft after they discovered Santamaria’s embezzlement in 2003, court documents show that dos Santos used similar methods to funnel money out of university accounts for almost two years.
“In light of the dos Santos case, over the past two years, Georgetown has also taken steps to increase oversight procedures, in particular by establishing new policies requiring review and reconciliation by financial managers,” university spokeswoman Julie Bataille told The Hoya in 2007. “On the main campus specifically, there has been an increased enforcement of existing policies and procedures [and] the development of additional controls and procedures.”
In the most recent case, however. the administrator’s theft went unnoticed for approximately three years.
“Certainly any large institution faces an ongoing challenge to ensure that all of its activities are conducted in a manner consistent with policies and procedures, and we are making every effort we can to improve our system, and training and awareness,” Pugh said. “It’s an ongoing challenge at a large institution.”
The unapproved compensation accounted for less than 0.04 percent of Georgetown’s annual operating revenue, according to Pugh.
“This is distinguishable from those two [previous] cases of fraud or embezzlement because there’s no evidence that the employee had intent to defraud anyone. The individual did not submit any false documentation and fully cooperated with the investigation and is voluntarily paying restitution,” Pugh said.
She emphasized the university’s efforts to prevent such situations in the future.
“Over a few years, we have adopted more rigorous policies and internal controls,” she said, citing a more robust compliance program and an internal audit function. “We’ve really made some efforts to make the policies clearer and to make sure all employees are educated about them and their responsibilities under the policies.”
The Post also reported that Columbia University was defrauded about $5 million during a two-month period in 2010, when its medical center accounts-payable system was reprogrammed to the bank account of computer-specialist George Castro, who was not a university employee. Columbia notified the authorities, cooperated with the criminal investigation and recovered almost all the money.
In the Post’s investigation, the largest case of financial diversion occurred at Yeshiva University, a private university in New York, which lost $106 million in a Ponzi scheme linked to Bernie Madoff.

Housing selection points for rising sophomores will be tied to attendance at a series of forums on diversity and sexual assault beginning this year.
The new initiative, called What’s a Hoya?, was launched by the Georgetown University Student Association with assistance from the Office of Residential Services and will take effect for fall 2014 housing selections in March.
Under past policy, rising sophomores receive two housing selection points, rising juniors receive four points and rising seniors who lived off campus in fall 2013 receive three points if they apply for eligibility. Following the new initiative, rising sophomores still receive two points, but will gain one-tenth of an additional housing point for every forum that they attend. With three forums offered, the maximum number of points for rising sophomores will be 2.3 and the minimum will remain two.
The selection points of students in groups of two, three or four for housing selection will be averaged. Higher point averages will give groups an earlier selection time to choose their preferred housing.
The university will offer four sessions of each module, including two weekend sessions, to help accommodate student schedules.
“We are excited to partner with GUSA to make this initiative launch successful, and in giving incentives to students based on their attendance to these important forums, we hope to see a large turnout, and a positive change on our campus,” Executive Director for Residential Services Patrick Killilee said.
GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS’14) and Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) first approached the Office of Residential Services early in the semester to discuss the program.
“We had this idea back in July to find a way to incentivize increased engagement in all aspects of student life here at Georgetown, and when we approached the administration with our plans, they were very supportive,” Tisa said.
Administrators determined that the initiative would be a valuable tool to educate on key areas such as sexual violence and diversity, and to raise awareness for campus resources.
The first training forum, focusing on mentorship, will take place Nov. 20 and feature a keynote speech from Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J. The session will also feature a student leadership panel and a host of faculty experts, along with alumni representing Hoya Gateway. Registration for the event will open Monday on HoyaLink. The three other sessions for the module are scheduled for Nov. 24, Nov. 25 and Dec. 6.
The second forum, on student health, is set for January, and the final forum, about community and diversity, is scheduled for February. In addition to attending the forum, students are expected to fill out a survey afterward.
A new GUSA committee will coordinate the sessions’ programming.
“Our job is to provide the framework, and the audience for these faculty experts,” What’s a Hoya? Coordinator and GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Chandini Jha (COL ’16) said. “Their job is the content, which will include everything from the prevalence of sexual assault on campus to establishing positive neighborhood relations to getting in touch with professors or tutors.”
Last year, Jha and other students pushed to add comprehensive, mandatory sexual assault training to New Student Orientation, but because of the tight NSO schedule, there was only an optional discussion at orientation.
“This idea is separate and addresses sexual violence as one of several cultural problems that we face here,” Jha said. “We’ve engaged in talks with experts from the administration, and we are letting them guide us on the most appropriate way to address this sensitive topic.”
The architects of the program saw housing as the appropriate avenue for these forums because of its effects on every student.
“Housing points was the perfect way to go, because it is the one thing that is in demand for every rising sophomore and it doesn’t cost the university money to slightly revise their selection system,”Tisa said.
GUSA and administrators, however, decided to limit the program to underclassmen.
“The decision was made that under no circumstances should a rising sophomore have more housing selection points than a rising junior, because we wanted to respect the older undergraduates,” Killileesaid.
What’s a Hoya? Coordinator Dan Silkman (COL ’15) expressed optimism at the expected reaction from the Class of 2017 to the new housing selection points system and the training forums.
“We talked it over with GUSA’s 15-member freshman outreach committee, and they all sounded excited for the initiative to begin,” Silkman said. “These forums will benefit each student’s Georgetown experience, and we expect a great turnout.”
However, after GUSA announced the Housing Passport Initative yesterday, reactions from the Class of 2017 were varied.
“I think that for proactive students with time of their hands, this is a great program,” Jack Rosenberg (SFS ’17) said. “But for those of us who have a packed extracurricular schedule, it puts us at an unfair disadvantage for housing points. I’d be in favor of a return to the old system where all freshmen were at least on level footing for housing selection.”
Tiffany Lam (NHS ’17) said that the initiative was good, but unnecessary.
“I think that it doesn’t hurt to be taught about health resources, sexual assault and good neighborhood conduct, but it’s a bit redundant,” Lam said. “At least this system will take away the feeling of total randomness from housing selection.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to the housing initiative by an earlier name. It is called What’s a Hoya?, not the GUSA Housing Passport Initiative. Due to an editing error, the article also incorrectly reported that the student health forum would take place in February, while the community and diversity forum would take place in January. The community and diversity forum will be in February, and the student health forum will be in January. The quotation, “Housing points was the perfect way to go,” was additionally misattributed to GUSA Vice President Adam Ramadan. It was said by GUSA President Nate Tisa.

The early action applicant pool for the Class of 2018 is more diverse than in years past, with white applicants dropping from 59 percent in 2011 to 56 percent this year.
According to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69), this is a significant trend, particularly for this phase.
“The early pool is more likely to favor the more traditional applicant,” Deacon said. “I would say the fact that we’re getting an increasingly diverse early pool is a good thing.”
After seeing an increase in early applications for several years, the number of early applicants to the Class of 2018 remained mostly unchanged from last year, with 6,569 early applications processed so far compared to the 6,565 processed at this time in 2012.
“Happily, things are the same. We would have predicted, by all expectations, that [the number of applications] would be going down,” Deacon said.
Deacon expects that the total number of early applications will be between 6,700 and 6,800, staying about even with the 6,840 early action applications to the Class of 2017, 880 of which were ultimately accepted.
Distribution across three of the four undergraduate schools has remained mostly static as well.
Little change was seen in the geographic distribution of early applicants, despite the fact that the largest drop in college-bound students occurred in the Northeast, traditionally a major source of Georgetown applicants.
“Early numbers tend to skew a little toward places that are ready to apply early, which tend to be more likely in the more affluent communities in the Northeast,” Deacon said.
The School of Nursing and Health Studies was the only school to experience a decline in applicants, a break from recent trends. The NHS has received 457 early applicants to the Class of 2018, as compared with the 502 applications processed at this point last year.
“It’s nothing to be alarmed about,” Deacon said.
SAT scores of early applicants have remained largely unchanged from the previous year’s critical reading and mathematics median scores of 700 to 770.
Deacon anticipates offering admission to about 950 applicants from the early action pool for an acceptance rate of about 15 percent.
“We really review and rate to admit, not to deny,” he said.
The stability in the number of early applications was good news for Georgetown, as the number of college-bound students has been decreasing nationally since 2010, with the largest decline among white students. However, growth in the number of minority students, especially those of Hispanic descent, is offsetting this trend.
“Don’t expect the numbers to go up, be happy if they don’t go down and look at the quality of who is actually there,” Deacon said.

Immigrants living in the District of Columbia illegally can now obtain drivers licenses in the District after the D.C. Council voted to pass the D.C. Drivers Safety Amendment Act on Nov. 5.
“D.C. has decided to ensure access to drivers licenses for all D.C. residents, regardless of immigration status. That’s incredibly important,” D.C. Immigrant Rights Coalition Coordinator Salvador Sarmiento said. “That’s going to affect thousands of people’s lives in D.C. for the better.”
The bill, introduced by Council Chairman Phil Mendelson at the request of Mayor Vincent Gray, will create a two-tiered ID system, in which these licenses will be marked: “not for federal purposes.”
“I personally think that it was a disappointment not to have one license because it puts in it an understanding of racial profiling,” said Jackie Reyes, the Director of Latino Affairs for Councilmember Jim Graham.
D.C. is already a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants, since Mayor Gray signed an order in 2011 stopping police officers from inquiring about residents’ immigration status unless it is directly relevant to a criminal investigation.
The adoption of the original two-tiered legislation came as a shock to many constituents.
“I was surprised two weeks ago when we first heard that the Transportation Committee Chair Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) was backpedaling from her initial strong statement in favor of one license,” Sarmiento said.
Hoyas for Immigrant Rights President Citlalli Alvarez (COL ’16) noted her disappointment with the new law.
“This bill was diluted. True, undocumented immigrants will now be able to attain licenses, but they will be marked. These licenses will not be ‘equal,’” Alvarez wrote in an email.
Others viewed Cheh’s actions as a reasonable compromise considering the restrictions of federal law.
“She was trying to do the best she could to create an ID option for people who weren’t otherwise able to get one, but not to also jeopardize the status of everyone else’s,” General Counsel for Councilmember Jack Evans’ Office Kevin Stogner said, adding that Cheh intends to make sure that the markings will be nondescript in order to minimize any resulting discrimination from the different license types.
“I’m not surprised that they ended up creating the two tier license system so the license would be labeled that they’re not federal I.D.,” department of government professor Mark Rom said. “I imagine the strategic calculation of the council was this is not an issue that we’re going to challenge the feds on.”
In order for immigrants living in the country illegally to be able to obtain a license when they apply, they will be required to provide a valid foreign passport, birth certificate or tax identification number. Additionally, applicants may only apply if they have lived in D.C. for a minimum of six months.
Because the two-tiered system officially identifies illegal immigrants, the question remains as to whether these immigrants will be hesitant in applying.
“They’ll keep driving for sure because people have to get to get to work, go to the store and get their kids to school. The driving will continue pretty much unchanged, how many licenses will be applied for — that’s the big question,”

A proposed minor in diversity, culture and ethnic studies went before the College Academic Council at the end of October.
Although students have previously discussed the option informally, the minor is now supported by the Cura Personalis Initiative, the student-run effort to address diversity issues that presented the preliminary proposal Oct. 22, and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson.
The minor would give students the opportunity to learn about their own cultures and compare that to others.
“Learning about your history and learning about your culture while also learning about other peoples’ cultures, is invaluable in American society,” CPI Co-Director Esther Owolabi (COL ’15) said.
Planning is still at an early stage, and the details of the potential minor are not completely clear.
“We just met with the College Academic Council last week, so we haven’t really sat down and really figured out the curriculum for the minor, but most minors are six courses long,” Owolabi said.
Because there is so much to figure out, the minor will not be implemented for at least two to three years, according to CAC President Kamil Lupicki (COL ’14).
“[The administration is] supportive, but to be realistic, it takes a very long time for these to get through,” Lupicki said.
The College Academic Council met with College Dean Chester Gillis Oct. 25 to discuss what would be involved in creating this new minor.
“The students’ idea for a new minor was provocative and interesting. At the moment, it is an idea that needs further development,” Gillis wrote in an email.
The six required courses for the minor have yet to be decided, as well as the faculty chair and professors. Although the minor could be composed of pre-existing courses slightly modified to fit the new angle, it would also most likely require an introductory course and a capstone, which would need funding.
“Anything that’s change to the curriculum at Georgetown, it’s very difficult to do, because there are so many requirements already. There are so many students that are going to have backlash,” Owolabi said.
However, the team intends to persist.
“Of course we’re going to face barriers, but right now we’re optimistic that we even have the chance to have these discussions or the possibility to implement this minor,” she said.
The members of the CPI have so far identified 50 alumni who were willing to donate to the creation of the minor.
To gauge general interest in this minor, the group also distributed an exit survey at a college majors fair two weeks ago.
CPI hopes that the development of an ethnic studies minor could lead to the development of a cultural and ethnic studies center, which could serve as a space for the program.
“It could be a really good way of getting our foot in the academic door,” CPI Co-Director Megan Griffin (COL ’14) said.
Owolabi added that she hopes the minor could influence diversity not only in academic life, but also in social life at Georgetown.
“I’d like to come back to Georgetown in 10 years for my reunion and see a more integrated Georgetown,” she said.

JOSH GORDON FOR THE HOYASome students are not satisfied with gluten-free options in Leo’s.In May, Udi’s, a gluten-free food company, named Georgetown the second-most gluten-free accommodating college Campus. Many students, however, are skeptical of this title, despite November’s designation as Gluten-Free Awareness Month.
Joe Lanzilla (SFS ’16), a celiac who is also dairy- and egg-free, said that he has repeatedly gotten sick after eating at O’Donovan Hall.
“Last year, personally, I had to go to the ER three times due to allergic reactions,” Lanzilla said. “There’s definitely room for improvement in Leo’s with the dietary staff. They do a fine job, but there probably can be improvements.”
Students with more obscure allergies also take issue with the presentation of dining hall options.
“They don’t label ingredients so much as they label allergens,” lactose intolerant, nut- and sesame-free Evan Chernack (SFS ’17) said. “It’s kind of misleading when it says contains no known allergens, because it could still contain no known allergens yet still have something that someone is allergic to.”
For Gluten-Free Awareness Month, Georgetown Dietitian Allison Marco will table in Leo’s to raise awareness about celiac disease and gluten intolerance. She will also hold focus groups for gluten-free students.
“Overall, the staff at Leo’s is aware of food allergies, and they take them seriously,” Marco wrote in an email. “We encourage the staff to ask questions, and I include allergy awareness along with nutrition topics in training we provide to the staff.”
In addition to concerns about availability of food, those with dietary restrictions find themselves restricted to a repetitive diet relying on a locked gluten-free fridge.
“There isn’t really much selection, and I feel like a lot of gluten-free students can’t eat from the fridge because there’s not a huge selection in there, and it’s kind of limited, and so they eat at the other stations, which is plausible, but at the same time, you risk contamination,” Lanzilla said.
Students have praised the new efforts to get student feedback on gluten-free dining.
“I think it’s really good to raise awareness for the restrictions that people face because a lot of people don’t necessarily know about how something so routine as eating or as having a meal becomes a lot more complicated when you factor in someone who has dietary restrictions,” Chernack said.

KAYLA NOGUCHI/THE HOYAThe new mascot’s caretaker, McKenzie Stough (COL ’13), walks the bulldog with Jack Crew member Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14). Jack will live with Stough in a townhouse on 36th Street.The Bulldog Advisory Committee chose Communications Specialist in the Office of Communications Mc-Kenzie Stough (COL ’13) as the next mascot caretaker Tuesday.
After graduating last year, Stough continued her relationship with Georgetown as an employee and decided to apply for the caretaker position.
“I know they’re looking, clearly, for someone who’s going to be here for a long time. The big priority is that it’s somebody that can commit,” she said. “And this fits in really well with my long-term plans because I’ve wanted to be part of the Georgetown community for a really long time — eventually, I’ll probably go to grad school after he’s totally acclimated and no longer a puppy — and so I think you can expect a pretty big time commitment.”
Stough has considerable experience, having raised three dogs with her family.
“I’ve really had dogs around me since I was about 5 years old, so this is just a really good way to use those strengths with my love for the Georgetown community and kind of get back involved with the students again,” Stough said.
The Jack Crew, now composed of six students, will work with Stough to build a stable environment and family for Jack in his townhouse on 36th Street. Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J., will continue to care for the old Jack in New South.
“We’re so excited to be working with McKenzie now and just kind of establish what’s going to be best for both her and Jack, and just be able to serve the puppy in whatever way we can that’s best for him,” Head of Jack Crew and BAC member Neve Schadler (COL ’15) said.
Stough will take over for Chief Operating Officer for Advancement Paul O’Neill (CAS ’86), who has taken care of the new bulldog since he arrived on campus Oct. 22.
“A lot of [the walking] is going to stay with the Jack Crew. I think the schedule will very much stay the same,” Stough said. “I’m kind of filling in for Paul and being like the dog’s mother at night, and feeding him, and staying with him at night, and making sure that there’s a solid presence with him at all times and somebody that he can really be comfortable with when we start taking him to events and things like that.”
Erika Cohen Derr, the leader of the BAC caretaker search, said Stough will acclimate well to her new role.
“She has a deep commitment to Georgetown’s bulldog mascot tradition. McKenzie will be a great caretaker for Jack and be able to manage his soon-to-be busy schedule. The BAC looks forward to welcoming McKenzie into this important role and the work of the BAC,” Cohen Derr wrote in an email.
BAC members agreed.
“You can see it when she’s with Jack. She knows how to strike that balance,” Jack Crew and BAC member Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) said. “You can just tell she strikes that balance between how to have fun with him and how to make sure he’s happy, but also not afraid to tell somebody, ‘Please don’t pet him,’ or ‘Don’t pet him like that.’”
As for Jack’s own acclimation, the focus still remains on gradually introducing him to the student environment.
“It’s just a matter of him growing up. So even after a year, he’s still going to need a lot of care and acclimation to large crowds, because being the mascot, he’s a working dog,” Schadler said. “Not only does he need to be acclimated to a new home and a new family and to the walkers but also to this new position that he has, so it will take over a year for that process to happen.”

CHARLIE LOWE/THE HOYAMayoral candidate Reta Jo Lewis emphasized the need for education and employment improvement during a speech at the Georgetown University Law Center on Tuesday.
“Job creation, and I mean good-paying jobs for working class families, has to be our primary focus,” she said in the speech, meant to reach out to younger voters.
Lewis, who officially announced her candidacy Nov. 2, is set to face off against D.C. Councilmembers Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) and Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) in the April 2014 primary mayoral election.
Lewis addressed the importance of mobilizing the city’s young voters for reform.
“Young, informed college students are rejecting the status quo and are interested in positive change here. We need more people to join in on this movement,” Lewis said.
Lewis criticized the D.C. Council’s recent decision to delay the election of the city’s first attorney general until 2018, despite voter approval authorizing the election and expressed frustration with Mayor Vincent Grayincent the Large RetaileLarge Retailer Accountability Act, which would have raised the minimum wage for large corporations that meet specific requirements, such as Wal-Mart, to $12.50 an hour.
“The bill may not have been good for big businesses, but it was good for workers. We don’t need six Wal-Marts — we need for businesses to set up shop in the areas of the city that need jobs the most,” Lewis said.
She also suggested that Gray’s decision to move up the election window from September 2014 to April 2014 creates an uneven playing field in a race against an incumbent.
In the closing minutes of the hour-long discussion, Lewis asserted her path to victory.
“The way that we win this race is by putting together a coalition of traditional and new voters, people determined to change our political system for the better, and to use my executive experience to help improve the lives of the District’s 632,000 people.”
Will Thanhauser (LAW ’14), who attended Lewis’ event, welcomed the opportunity to learn more about the race.
“These discussions help us to take more of an interest in the politics around us, and to encourage educated discourse about the future of our community,” he said.

COURTESY GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY COLLEGE DEMOCRATSStudents campaigned for Terry McAuliffe during the Virginia governor’s race.Democrat Terry McAuliffe (LAW ’84) won the race for governor of Virginia by fewer than three percentage points against Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli (R-Va.) Tuesday night. The results for attorney general are contested.
McAuliffe won by 55,737 votes, a much narrower margin than predicted by polls, leading many to speculate what these results indicate about the upcoming Congressional midterm elections and the 2016 presidential election.
Georgetown University College Democrats President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) viewed the race as both an affirmation of Virginia’s increasingly Democratic political slant and a rejection of Cuccinelli’s Tea Party-backed campaign.
“Depending on how the recount in the attorney general race goes, there is the potential that Democrats will have total control over all statewide offices. We may be able to begin discussing Virginia as a politically blue state instead of a swing state,” Tezel said.
Georgetown University College Republicans Communications Manager Tim Rosenberger (COL ’16) disagreed.
“I think this race shows that Virginia still actually has a red tilt. Republicans were coming off a scandal, were underfunded and horribly down in the polls,” Rosenberger said.
While many Republicans are claiming victory for Mark Obenshain as the next Virginia attorney general, Democrats are holding firm in the call for a recount. As of Thursday, Obenshain is ahead of his Democratic opponent Mark Herring by 777 votes.
“[Republicans] managed to retain the statehouse and win the only race that was supposed to be competitive, that of attorney general. Minority and women voters made up huge swathes of this electorate that was still very generous to outgunned Republicans,” Rosenberger said.
During the race, Georgetown students took to Virginia to campaign for both McAuliffe and Cuccinelli.
Alejandro Perez-Reyes (COL ’17), from Charlottesville, Va., touched on his motivations for becoming involved in supporting McAuliffe.
“My father is a pharmacologist at one of the flagship universities in the state, but due to sequester cutbacks in grant funding, his research is suffering. I mention this because I believe that with a McAuliffe win, the state government can refocus on economic issues and make smart investments in education and 21st century jobs,” Perez-Reyes said.
Perez-Reyes, who mainly campaigned in the increasingly Democratic-leaning D.C. suburbs of Fairfax, Loudon and Prince William counties, said the experience of going door-to-door, while largely positive, exposed him to interesting characters.
“I once talked to a man who was lamenting the degradation of the rule of law in America. He went on to tell me, ‘The white man is a dying breed,’” Perez-Reyes said. “Something told me that this one might not be worth the effort to persuade.”

COURTESY JOE LHOTAGeorgetown alumnus and Republican Joe Lhota (GSB ’76) lost his bid for mayor of New York on Tuesday, earning 24 percent of the vote compared to Democrat Bill de Blasio’s 73 percent.
De Blasio will be New York City’s first Democratic mayor in two decades, winning the election on a platform in opposition to the policies of three-term New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Lhota’s platform centered on fiscal responsibility, while de Blasio campaigned for reducing inequality in the city.
“My candidacy is a result of both my belief that I think that I offer more than the other candidates to best lead New York and my appreciation for the culture and community that make up this great city,” Lhota told The Hoya in February. De Blasio, whose margin of victory was the largest since five-borough elections began in 1897, emphasized his progressive platform in his victory speech.
“The people of this city have chosen a progressive path, and tonight we set forth on it together as one city,” de Blasio said in his acceptance speech.
Lhota’s campaign capitulated early, calling de Blasio a half-hour after the polls closed, according to a spokesperson for de Blasio.
“It was a good fight, and it was a fight worth having,” Lhota said to a crowd Tuesday night.
In his concession speech, Lhota also managed one last jab at his opponent, referencing de Blasio’s campaign tagline of New York as a “tale of two cities.”
“Despite what you might have heard, we are all one city,” Lhota said in his concession speech. “We want our city to move forward and not backward, and I hope our mayor-elect understands that before it’s too late.”
Lhota’s passion for government started during his time at Georgetown, when he ran for student government on a campaign platform that included investigating the finances of Healy Pub, an aspect foreshadowing his current fiscal policies in New York. His daughter Kathryn (COL ’13) did not respond to requests for comment.
Lhota, the former chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Association, launched his mayoral bid after impressing New Yorkers with his handling of the subway system during and after Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. However, he struggled with mayoral debates and campaign finances, raising a third of what de Blasio was able to solicit from his supporters, according to The New York Times.
Students from New York saw these problems throughout the race.
“He was a good candidate, I know he had some money issues in the beginning, and he could have articulated his positions better in the long run,” Staten Island resident Louis Cona (COL ’15) said. “I think the election was a referendum on a lot of the Bloomberg administration’s policies.”
Despite the differences in party affiliation, New York City resident Christopher Ferzli (COL ’15) compared de Blasio to former Republican Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
“He’s representing the Italian New Yorkers from Brooklyn especially, like Rudy did,” Ferzli said.

Today, the Georgetown’s men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams will travel to Piscataway, N.J., to compete against Rutgers, Seton Hall and Villanova in the Big East Quad Meet.
Rutgers hosts its second meet in a row, having beaten Wagner on Oct. 25. The combined efforts of the men’s and women’s teams led to their decisive victory, in which the Hoyas rackied up 181 points and the Seahawks only scored 119. Villanova, on the other hand, heads to Rutgers coming off losses on both the men’s and women’s sides against former Big East foe UConn on Nov. 2. Seton Hall arrives in Piscataway with an away win under its belt after beating Providence 175-118 on Nov. 2. Each of the three opponents have individual strengths that will pose strong competition for the Hoyas.
“Rutgers and Villanova are the strongest women’s teams, but really, all the teams are strong and will provide a good test,” Head Coach Jamie Holder said. “Rutgers seems to be stronger than last year. I know Villanova graduated a great class last year, but they are still very good, and Seton Hall also has a strong team and several very good freshmen.”
Georgetown has its own strengths as well. The team dominates in distance races, the butterfly and individual medleys, according to Holder. The senior captains on the men’s side, Christian Kilgore, Matthew Mandel and Josh Tucci, are all holding significant leadership roles, as are the senior captains of the women’s side, Allison Fulenwider and Michelle Konkoly. The 2013 season also consists of some notable freshmen in the mix for the Blue and Gray.
“We have a great freshman class all around but Molly Gaynor, Katie Duncalf and Sarah Grundman have really had an impact so far, and on the guy’s side, Evan Grey, Martin Vanin and David Chung have really stepped up so far,” Holder said.
Gaynor, Duncalf and Grundman each won two individual events apiece at the Boston College meet. Vanin joined forces with junior Michael Young, along with Kilgore and Mandel, to snatch up a first place victory in the 200-meter medley versus BC.
Competing with other Big East opponents is always an advantage for Georgetown. With the conference championships looming at the end of February, getting a feel for the largest threats in the Big East is extremely helpful for the Hoyas.
“It is a great opportunity to swim against Big East competition and gives us a chance to race some of the same teams we will at conference championships, so in that sense, it is significant,” Holder said. Though the team is looking ahead in this sense, the Blue and Gray strive to focus on each meet without being caught up with past meets or future competitions.
“It was good to get the win, but I think we are taking all of our competitions one at a time and just going to go out and give it our best each time out,” Holder said of the win against BC.
Georgetown will head to Rutgers with a motivated frame of mind, hoping to prove they can be competitive in the conference.
“[The meet] is just another stepping stone in our journey this season. I just want them to get up and race,” Holder said.
The races will begin at 4:00 p.m. on Nov. 8 and 10 a.m. on Nov. 9 in Piscataway, N.J.

Students for Justice in Palestine withdrew its co-sponsorship of a film screening with the Georgetown Israel Alliance and J Street U, an event that was supposed to herald an unprecedented collaboration between the historically contentious organizations.
The SJP board made the last-minute decision Tuesday to officially disassociate the organization from the event, after determining that it did not align with their national organization’s platform, which opposes normalization — treating Israelis and Palestinians as equals instead of the oppressor and oppressed, respectively — of the Israel-Palestine conflict.
After SJP’s withdrawal, GIA and J Street U, which advocates for a two-state solution, also withdrew their co-sponsorships, instead attending as individuals rather than representatives of their respective organizations. The screening of “The Other Son,” a French film about an Israeli and a Palestinian switched at birth, still attracted more than 100 people.
“I guess from the beginning of the time that the event was conceived I knew myself and a few others always felt a little bit uncomfortable with the event, but we continued,” SJP President Albert Doumar (SFS ’15) said. “As we began to have more reservations about it, we had to decide among ourselves how to frame the event to be suitable to our cause or an event. … There was no way to structure the event to do that.”
Doumar maintains that the Georgetown SJP chapter did not receive explicit pressure from outside groups to withdraw. While SJP leaders were apologetic for the late hour of withdrawal, they reached the conclusion that participating in an event contradictory to their ideals would have been detrimental.
“Discussions were taking place on campus between our members and we were receiving word from different groups,” he said. “It wasn’t so much backlash as [the groups] trying to explain more about normalization and trying to understand from us why we were undertaking the event.”
As publicity for the event spread, the Georgetown chapter of SJP received messages from chapters at Rutgers, Cornell and the University of Maryland College Park, among others.
“There’s a recognition that all of us are allies in the same struggle, so it was important we presented a unified front to make sure the decisions of any one SJP did not jeopardize the goals of the greater organization,” Doumar said.
Though GIA and J Street U understood SJP’s obligation to its national organization, student leaders were disappointed.
“With their withdrawal, it was a very unfavorable action because it undermined the very purpose of the event,” GIA President Nitzan Gabai (SFS ’16) said. “To facilitate discussion not only on campus but beyond, we needed to use organizations that were bigger than campus.”
In October, GIA held an event with both Israeli and Palestinian guests that was designed to inspire campus discussion. Gabai hoped for the screening to be an event that would have extended the possibility of discussion beyond campus and felt that opportunity was lost when the organizations withdrew their sponsorship in favor of individual leadership.
“The minute we changed it to an individual-based event, the agenda was marginalized to an on-campus conversation,” he said. “All in all, we still have to look at the glass half-full and go on with the event.”
J Street U organizers felt that the universal decision to attend as individuals was the best way to promote dialogue, despite the sudden developments.
“In some ways it would have been a stronger collective message to show this organizational partnership to other campuses across the nation, but at the same time, we were stripped of that luxury by the sticky situation the leaders of SJP were put in,” J Street U President Jake Sorrells (SFS ’16) said. “I think that was outside our control, and we responded in a way that would allow us to capitalize on that opportunity. There was really nothing else we can do. It inadvertently strengthened our message.”
However, Sorrells maintained that SJP’s withdrawal represented the reasons why dialogue was necessary.
“I think the situation that unravelled emboldened our resolve to conduct this program,” Sorrells said. “It was sort of a microcosm of the very challenges that have typically hindered [progress].”
Gabai said he had hoped that SJP members would have broken out of the constraints of the larger national organization.
“Georgetown students are trendsetters,” Gabai said. “I was very saddened, because I thought that the board of the SJP would be able to set the trend.”
Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner delivered remarks after the screening, in addition to a videotaped message from Director of Muslim Chaplaincy Imam Yahya Hendi, both university officials.
“What happened at GU does not happen elsewhere. It did happen and let’s build on that,” Hendi wrote in an email. “I am so proud of our kids, all of them, for they made it happen. [It’s] going beyond borders to build bridges.”
Gartner encouraged participating students and said that she was proud of the way the organizers handled the event.
“It would break my heart if this minor snafu derailed the process that began when they were planning this,” she said. “My prayer is that students build on the relationships they’ve made in preparing for this event, and build on what they’ve learned about themselves and one another, both in the planning stages and at the film showing itself and find a way to move forward.”
J Street U Treasurer Elijah Jatovsky (SFS ’16), who conceived the idea of the event, said that despite the last-minute challenges, he is hopeful for future cooperation.
“I really want to stress that we view this event as absolutely not a failure,” Jatovsky said. “We will look back on this as an evening that kickstarted the development of dialogue.”
 
Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated Imam Yahya Hendi’s title as director of Jewish chaplaincy. He is director of Muslim chaplaincy.
