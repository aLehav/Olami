It’s Tuesday and long after dark, and GUSA President MikeMeaney (SFS ’12) is dancing in the Intercultural Center.
Meaney pulls up the bottom of his mesh shorts, slides to the left and strikes a pose. He is trying to stay in sync with the track, LMFAO’s “Party Rock Anthem,” but he looks a little discombobulated. His dance instructor, Groove Theory’s Hannah Conn (COL ’12), nods her approval.
“I think you’re starting to get it,” she says encouragingly.
This isn’t just a casual dance lesson for Meaney; he has a performance in Gaston Hall scheduled for tonight. As Mr. GUSA, Meaney has to be ready to strut his stuff at the Mr. Georgetown Pageant, a Homecoming tradition that lets a handful of senior men duke it out to see who is the most talented, the most accomplished and, of course, the most glamorous.
As The Hoya reported in 2005, the pageant made its debut during Homecoming weekend of that year with 10 contestants, who paraded around in thongs and eveningwear.
The brainchild of the Georgetown Program Board, the event served as a charity fundraiser, with the winner deciding where to donate the proceeds. It was a huge hit — students loved the absurdity of seeing their classmates try their hand at modeling and performing talents like rhythmic gymnastics, as performed by Adam Arguelles (SFS ’06).
Since then, the show has continued to be a highlight of Homecoming weekend, especially for seniors.
This year’s pageant has 13 entrants hailing from clubs all across campus, including the South Asian Society, Pep Band and the Georgetown Improv Association. For the last week, they have been practicing the collective dance routine, which opens the show and introduces the audience to the candidates. According to the instructors, it’s a sensual dance, with plenty of gyrating and belt grabbing to go around.
The actual contest itself looks like a combination of “American Idol” and “America’s Next Top Model.” Three judges determine the winner based on four categories: an interview, a formalwear display, a swimwear display and a talent portion. It’s a marathon event, broken up by performances by the Phantoms, Groove Theory and rapper Tate Tucker (COL ’14).
Behind all the dancing and revelry, sophomore Eunice Chin (MSB ’14) has been hard at work to put the show on stage. Chin is the special events chair for the Georgetown Program Board and was tasked last year with planning the 2011 Mr. Georgetown Pageant. Her work began in the summer, when she put together an initial proposal outlining requirements and costs.
With the guidance of her adviser, Tanesha Stewart, she booked Gaston Hall for the event, scheduled a sound team, ordered sashes and even recruited GUTV to film.
Even though she has been immersed in the logistics, Chin says that she is fairly hands-off when it comes to regulations for the actual participants.
“I want it to be really fun for everyone,” she said. “I told them that they can wear whatever swimsuit they want and to yell out to the crowd if they want to do that, too.”
For the participants, Chin’s lax approach has translated into confusion over what they are actually doing onstage. Sitting around a table in the ICC after a dance rehearsal, the men laugh about how little they can tell me about the pageant.
“They don’t really tell us much, they just keep us in the dark,” Nathan Epstein (COL ’12), Mr. Pep Band, says.
“We actually don’t know the rules,” adds Zeeshan Feerasta (MSB ’12), Mr. South Asian Society.
To the contestants, that’s not a bad thing at all. The fun for them is in the clowning and tomfoolery in front of their peers.
“It’s probably going to be a big crowd of mostly seniors, and just a fun night of seeing a couple of your peers doing some dorky stuff onstage, going out in a suit, going out in a swimsuit, doing some talent,” Chris Butterfield (MSB ’12), Mr. Senior Class Committee, explains.
The group gets along swimmingly, playing off each other and garnering laughs for the entire conversation. The only outlier is Jed Feiman (COL ’12), Mr. Improv, who insists that the pageant is about far more than giggles.
“Behind this, we are all competitors here, and we all want it,” Feiman says. For him, he says, it has been a life ambition.
“When I got nominated, I cried. I was so excited. I have always wanted to do this,” he says, sending the other contestants into hysterics.
“This is what Georgetown is about, what men and women for others means.”

This is the second story in a three-part series on alumni journeys beyond the Hilltop.
As this year’s seniors gather references, polish resumes and hit the pavement in search of a career, their predecessors’ stories are a testament to the uphill battle ahead.
A WAITING GAME
For Ben Zeidler (COL ’09), nailing down post-graduation plans was no easy task. During his senior year job search, Zeidler sent out nearly 100 applications, received five interviews and was offered two jobs.
“You can put in all the time in the world in building a solid resume and making yourself marketable, but in this job market, you still have to get lucky,” he said.
Knowing how much was up to chance made the search nerve-wracking for Zeidler, who wasn’t offered employment until about one month before graduation.
“I had the job locked down in April, but for a month there I was very nervous that I wouldn’t find anything. All of my financial friends knew what they were doing long before,” he said. Zeidler now works for Forrester Research, a search company in New York.
Not all students are so fortunate. According to the Career Education Center’s senior survey of the class of 2010, 29.7 percent of seniors had not found a job by graduation.
“Trying to find a job was like adding another class to my schedule,” said Noelle Trogone (COL ’11), who wasn’t offered her current position in the Patient Services Department at New York Downtown Hospital until late June.
Unlike Ziedler, Trogone did not send resumes to dozens of employers. She applied for 15 jobs between fall 2010 and spring 2011, saying that it was much easier to focus on her search during the summer.
But for a small percentage of students, this extra time is not enough. By the time that last year’s survey was completed in November 2010, 8 percent of graduates still identified themselves as “seeking employment.”
The majority of these students were graduates of the College and the School of Foreign Service, who hold unemployment rates of 9 percent and 10 percent, respectively. By comparison, the McDonough School of Business had a lower rate of 7 percent. The School of Nursing and Health studies boasted the lowest unemployment rate of 4 percent.
According to Trogone, this data may be a reflection of the kind of degrees that these schools grant.
“A lot of our degrees from the College are really broad. Perhaps employers like degrees more focused on a career path, like finance or other business school degrees,” she said.
FEELING UNPREPARED
Joe Brown (COL ’11), now a social policy analyst for Mathematica Policy Research, also found himself questioning aspects of his Georgetown education in light of the job application process.
Brown’s search lasted nearly three months and involved approximately 400 different applications. He was invited for 15 interviews and four final-round interviews, eventually receiving two offers.
“The job search was tough for a while. I was a little disappointed in myself and kept thinking of the things I should’ve done differently to make myself more marketable,” he said.
The search made Brown question whether Georgetown had prepared him to be a viable candidate in the current job market.
“The market seems to be looking for tangible skills that employers can use to place people into the specific, limited roles that are available,” he said. “Georgetown does a remarkable job training students to critically think, but … a liberal arts background doesn’t necessarily translate into those tangible skills.”
EVALUATING CAREER SERVICES
For students like Brown who are struggling to maneuver the complexities of the job market, the Career Education Center is often advertised as a vital resource.
According to the center’s executive director, Mike Schaub, the organization offers students a variety of services, including databases for finding full-time positions and internships and access to an extensive alumni network.
At the center, students can also participate in mock interviews and listen to presentations from a variety of firms, companies and government agencies that visit campus. In addition, students have the ability to meet with career counselors or access general tips online.
But some students feel that the Career Center didn’t go far enough to reach out to struggling seniors.
“Georgetown didn’t do a fantastic job helping me find a job. The services were definitely there, but I feel like they didn’t reach out to students,” Ziedler said.
For Brown, the center was too focused on providing information about specific kinds of jobs.
“Georgetown was very good about bringing in corporations, but not as good about bringing in a variety of industries that I could pursue,” he said.
The senior survey did not include statistics on how many students landed positions through the career center, a fact that Schaub attributed to the difficulty of defining exactly what role the center plays in helping students find employment.
“The Career Center plays a role in students’ job searches in a variety of ‘direct’ (e.g., job postings, networking events, job fairs, on-campus interviews) and ‘indirect’ (e.g., job search workshops, interview preparation, resume reviews, career counseling) ways,” he wrote in an email.
Though Trogone credited the career center with helping her to obtain several interviews during her search, both of her final offers came without any input from the center.
“The thing that helped me the most in this process was my own personal network. Both job offers I received came from my own personal network,” she said.
But for Andrew Brewster (COL ’11), the career center’s resources proved invaluable in helping him to secure his position at Audax Private Equity, an investment company based in Boston and New York.
“There was a lot that I didn’t take advantage of, but there was a huge push to get kids to come in and after I did come in, the job search process was very quick,” he said.
WHAT’S IN A NAME
Despite the ups and downs of the job search, recent graduates say that the Georgetown name did a lot to improve their chances.
“Georgetown has a fantastic relationship with many of the investment banks,” Brewster said, noting the university’s role in helping him land his job.
Trogone agreed, crediting Georgetown’s reputation and extensive alumni network as appealing to employers.
“[Potential employers] were impressed by my Georgetown diploma,” she said. “Personal [connections] made a big difference too. For example, one of my interviewers’ sister was a Georgetown grad.”
Brewster offered words of encouragement to current seniors worrying about their life beyond the gates.
“[The job search] was a very stressful time, but in the end I landed a great job,” he said.

While thousands of Georgetown hopefuls finalize their applications, over 5,000 members of the Alumni Ambassadors Program are gearing up to interview prospective members of the class of 2016.
“The interview adds another layer to the application and gives us a bit more insight into the applicant,” said Colleen Miltenberg, assistant director of undergraduate admissions and one of the program’s coordinators.
AAP, founded in 1964 with fewer than 400 interviewers, now includes members from all 50 states, ranging from six in Wyoming to the multitudes in the D.C. area.
Since its inception, the program has grown to become an integral part of Georgetown’s admissions process. In its founding year, AAP’s members interviewed 32 percent of the total applicant pool. But last admissions cycle, according to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, alumni interviewed more than 90 percent of applicants. AAP expects to match that number this year.
Robert Adelberg (C ’59), who has been involved with AAP interviewing since its inception, said that the program’s growth has not diminished its core mission — to bring the best students to the university.
“That was the way we, as alumni, could give back in the finest measure,” he said of the group’s founding. “We were picking the next generation to succeed us at Georgetown.”
Since joining the program, he has interviewed at least four applicants a year. In some seasons, his interviews number in the dozens.
 
MAKING THE CUT
According to Miltenberg, the AAP keeps alumni involved with their alma mater while fulfilling the university’s need for admissions interviewers.
“The AAP gives alumni a chance to stay connected to their communities, to local high schools and to us,” she said.
Most alumni who express interest in interviewing are assigned to a local chair. In regions with many more applications than interviewers, the admissions office actively seeks out alumni who can interview.
While Miltenberg said that no official criteria are used for selecting interviewers, undergraduate alumni are preferred over those who earned graduate degrees at Georgetown.
Interviewers are organized into 170 domestic and over 50 international committees. In the United States, committees are organized by geographic location and population. If the university receives many applications from a certain region, the AAP may create several committees in that area. In other locations, such as North Dakota and Wyoming, a single committee may serve the entire state.
Though Miltenberg could not provide the exact number of interviewers in each committee, she said that those in New York and Washington, D.C., are the largest, due to Georgetown’s high concentration of alumni in those regions.
She said the AAP committees in Dallas-Ft. Worth, Texas, Princeton, NJ., South Orange County, Calif. and San Jose, Calif., completed the largest number of interviews last year with over 240 applicants apiece.
Of all the international committees, the groups serving Great Britain and China interviewed the most prospective students in the Class of 2015 cycle.
HOYAS THROUGH AND THROUGH
AAP members span a broad range of age and experience: Some are well-established members of local communities and hold senior-level jobs in business, law or medicine, while others, like Elizabeth Griffin (COL ’05), are more recent graduates who wish to maintain their ties with the Hilltop.
After moving from Georgetown to Syracuse, N.Y., Griffin signed up for the program online when she heard last year that the committee in her region needed more interviewers.
“It’s definitely a great way to stay connected to your alma matter and talk to young people,” she said.
As a new member, Griffin said that she was required to attend an informal training session, where she was given sample questions to ask and informed of new programs on campus that she could discuss with applicants.
Kyle Pietrantonio (COL ’03) is entering his seventh season as an alumni interviewer in Atlanta. He plans to meet between five and seven applicants during this cycle.
According to Pietrantonio, the OA’s regional liaison for his area, Lia Glavin, visited the Atlanta committee to update them on changes to the admissions process and to review last year’s admissions results.
Pietrantonio said that the university’s support for AAP has grown since he first joined the organization.
“I would say that the level of support and guidance from the admissions office has improved,” he said, adding that the process is faster now that interviewers are authorized to submit reports over the Internet.
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INTERVIEW
Kimberly Snow (COL ’77), co-director of the Orlando, Fla. committee, said that members do not use a set script or list of questions when conducting interviews.
“We’re not really given any [detailed] training. They just showed you a couple sample interviews, and that was it,” she said. “You really had to mold your own way of interviewing from there, and some interviewers are better than others.”
Snow, who has been an AAP member for almost 30 years, said that interviewing is not as easy as it might seem.
“It’s particularly difficult here in the South, because not many people get accepted,” she said. “I have interviewers in my committee who have been working for 15 or 20 years and have not had one of their applicants get into Georgetown. It’s very frustrating for them.”
For many alumni, like Shana Bynon (SFS ’93), this frustration is eclipsed by a sense of service and commitment to the university.
“I find it pretty rewarding, doing the interviews,” she said. “I really enjoy being connected to campus through the applicants every year.”
Bynon, who volunteers for the Baltimore committee, said the five to seven interviews that she completes a year allow her to promote the university’s ideals.
“I remember my alumni interview. It was one of the things I really liked about applying to Georgetown,” she said.
After 45 years of interviews, Adelberg said that he still finds the process to be incredibly enriching.
“If you believe in what your school stands for, it’s the finest form of salesmanship for the next generation that comes along,” he said.

Ye Domesday Booke will continue to publish after being dropped by the Media Board as a student organization last month.
The yearbook, which has been printing since 1905, will now be sponsored directly by the Center for Student Programs, according to CSP Director Erika Cohen-Derr.
“I don’t think that the Media Board was comfortable designating and selecting leadership for the yearbook, but they saw there was value in it,” she said.
Due to declining interest and a dwindling staff, the Media Board voted to end the yearbook’s status as an organization under its purview with the intention that CSP would absorb the publication. Days before the decision, the board sent out an email encouraging students to apply to be co-editors of the tome.
Cohen-Derr said that about 10 students expressed interest in working for Ye Domesday Booke, and she plans to hold the first meeting for the organization this month. While organized under the CSP, the yearbook will remain student run. Other student groups, such as the Senior Class Council and General Program Board, are also considered administrative groups under the CSP.
According to Cohen-Derr, the switch will not entail any major changes to the organization, but the price of yearbooks will be reduced from $90 to $80 dollars.
“I will convene the students who are interested and help get them organized,” Cohen-Derr said, adding that she thought that 10 students would be enough to produce the yearbook in its typical format.
But concerns remain about the viability of the publication due to low interest.
“This is not the first year Ye Domesday Booke has lacked student interest, and if it is not a trend that reflects the overall demise of written publications, then it should be possible to improve recruitment,” transition editor Ciara Foldenauer (SFS ’14) wrote in an email. “From my understanding, the current amount of administrative support is sufficient, but student interest must improve in order to justify the time, money and effort of such a tradition.”

The Student Activities Commission unveiled plans for a new funding system to a roundtable of student group leaders Wednesday night in response to student complaints over SAC’s programming-arc funding model.
“I want to stress that we’re presenting a draft — nothing here is set in stone,” SAC Chairman Andy Koenig (COL ’12) said. “That’s why we’ve asked you to come at this point. This is the first time that this is being presented in one coherent piece.”
The plan calls for student groups to submit a line-item budget for the following semester. Once all the budgets have been collected and the total amount of funding requested is calculated, SAC will determine how much it will be able to fill the funding requests.
“Last semester, we initially funded around 77 percent, but after adjustments and ad hoc additions, ended up funding around 90 percent,” SAC Vice-chair Ruiyong Chen (SFS ’13) said.
Much of the night’s discussion revolved around the topic of ad hoc funding for club events not included on the original budget. SAC commissioner Eric Neidle (SFS ’12) stressed that ad hoc funding will be a priority in the revamp, though he warned that funding levels would remain consistent.
“If we didn’t have enough money during the initial budget process and could only fund student groups at 80 percent, we would only fund ad hoc requests at a maximum of 80 percent,” Neidle said.
Former chair of the International Relations Club and founding member of Georgetown’s new Student Group Union Eitan Paul (SFS ’12) has long been critical of SAC’s funding system. Paul said Wednesday that he thought the proposed guidelines represented a drastic improvement.
“I just want to really take our hats off to you guys,” he said. “There are obviously still some issues in this system to be hammered out, but I think this system really addresses and corrects a lot of the issues that I and other people in this room have brought up. So I just really want to thank you guys for your hard work on this new system.”
Additional discussion revolved around SAC funding for travel. Koenig explained that with the new system, SAC has already set aside $31,000 exclusively for travel in the spring of 2012. Use of these travel funds will be allocated on a strictly ad hoc basis with every request requiring an appearance in front of the commission.
Under the proposed model, groups deemed “travel groups,” where travel is an essential part of the group’s mission, will receive partial funding for three trips per semester. Two trips will be funded at 55 percent of cost, with a third funded at 25 percent of cost. Non-travel groups would receive similarly structured funding but at a 10 percent lower rate.
Several issues, including event modifications, appropriateness of requests and transparency, must be hammered out in the coming weeks so the plan can be implemented before next semester.

This weekend, Georgetown will expand its online presence through its year-long pilot partnership with Grockit, an interactive learning start-up.
Founded in 2007 by Farb Nivi, a former National Teacher of the Year for The Princeton Review and Academic Director at Kaplan Test Prep, Grockit employs adaptive learning algorithms, gaming aspects and visual tools to help students prepare for tests like the SAT, GMAT, LSAT and MCAT. The company also identifies students’ academic weaknesses and tracks their progress.
The administration reached out to Grockit after discovering through conversations with students over the summer a campus-wide desire for additional applications and software that directly apply to academic life.
The company will now begin developing supplementary educational tools for students and alumni. The program pilot will be open to all students and alumni interested in experimenting with the platform.
Grockit recently raised an additional $7 million in funding to expand its services, which now include Facebook Study Rooms, audio conferencing, shared whiteboards, chat rooms for peer tutoring and Grockit Answers, a tool that transforms YouTube videos into question and answer sessions.
The initiative has been spearheaded by Randy Bass, assistant provost and director of Center for New Designs in Learning & Scholarship, Michael Wang, special assistant to the Chief Operating Officer and Victor Reinoso, a senior advisor to university President John J. DeGioia.
Georgetown will launch its partnership with Grockit through its Start-Up Weekend, held in the McDonough School of Business today through Sunday. The events — open to students, alumni, faculty and D.C. residents — will allow participants to share their thoughts with the Grockit team.
Grockit’s services are based on its research that demonstrates that students benefit from collaborate study. Many students believe that the Grockit platform can supplement their preferred study habits, which often tend to be individual-focused.
“I prefer studying alone because I avoid distraction, and it’s easier because I can just study what I need to study and control how long I work,” Christian Keenum (MSB ’15) said. “I also like to study in groups because I can ask questions. … The chat room function is a crucial advantage, because you can have instant communication, and typing online is less distracting than conversing in person.”

The Georgetown University Medical Center tapped Jamie Padmore to become the associate dean for Graduate Medical Education and Educational Scholarship Monday.
Padmore, previously a School of Medicine administrator, was also promoted to vice president for academic affairs with MedStar, the healthcare provider and clinical partner for the Medical Center, as well as an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Surgery.
Padmore, who holds a masters of science in health administration, has worked with GUSM’s graduate medical education program for the past 17 years, working nine of those years as assistant vice principal for academic affairs.
Padmore wrote in an email that her experience at Georgetown has afforded her the opportunities to advance and innovate GUSM’s educational curriculum.
“I’ve had the privilege of working in medical education for the past seventeen years, with world-renowned faculty and leaders in GME. This experience has provided me with opportunities to lead efforts to create innovative programs in medical education,” she said.
Padmore said that she hopes to update teaching methods to continue to make GUSM a more prominent institution for medical education.
She also aims to establish a new research program called the Office of Educational Scholarship, which would encourage students, residents and faculty to publish their research and increase Georgetown’s level of medical scholarship.
Padmore said that she looks forward to collaborating with the faculty at both GUSM and MedStar Health in accomplishing these goals.
“I feel very privileged that the university has demonstrated [its] trust in me to lead these important initiatives in medical education, and I am excited to be part of the Hoya family,” she wrote.

The Iranians who allegedly plotted to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States were aware that their plan to bomb a D.C. restaurant could cause mass casualties.
Their response: “If the hundred go with him, [expletive] ‘em.”
After the foiled plot was announced, rumors spread that the likely target was high-end restaurant Cafe Milano — located just seven blocks from the front gates on Prospect Street near Wisconsin Avenue.
Two men, one an Iranian-born U.S. citizen and the second reportedly associated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, were accused of plotting the assassination of Saudi ambassador Adel al-Jubeir (GRD ’84). This summer, the pair approached a man they thought was a Mexican drug cartel associate, but who was, in fact, an undercover U.S. informant. The Iranian-American was arrested Sept. 29 and plans to plead not guilty to the charges.
At the time of the arrest, the assassins had allegedly finalized their plans to use a C-4 explosive to bomb a restaurant that the ambassador was known to frequent twice a week, according to records taken by the informant. U.S. authorities have also said that the Israeli embassy could have been a secondary target.
An assassin was quoted as saying that collateral damage extending to roughly 150 people in the surrounding area would be “no big deal.”
For some Georgetown students, the likely proximity of the planned attack changes their perspective on safety in D.C.
“It’s almost unbelievable,” said Tim Devita (COL ’14). “We don’t really realize that we are in the U.S. capital, and we’re reminded that it is a high security risk to live here.”
Cafe Milano is well-known as a hotspot for Washington insiders. Multiple reports have suggested that it was the target, although the restaurant is never explicitly mentioned in legal documents. A manager at Cafe Milano said he did not know if the restaurant was targeted.
“It’s a little scary,” said Krista Engemann (COL ’13) upon hearing the news. She remarked that she felt reminded of what it was like to live in New York City during the 9/11 attacks.
A worker at Tuscany Cafe, a pizzeria on the same block as Cafe Milano, expressed shock upon hearing how close the explosion could have been to his workplace. The employee, who asked not to be identified, said that such news in Washington is more frightening than the persistent threat of danger he once experienced living through a foreign civil war.
John Collins (COL ’14) said he has a different perspective from having grown up in New York City and experiencing terrorist threats.
“You got to live life, right?” Collins said. “I’m pretty confident in our homeland security, and there are plots all the time.”

Teach For America Founder and CEO Wendy Kopp stressed the need to restructure the American public school system to a packed Copley Formal Lounge in an informal discussion Wednesday night.
“There is something daunting about that, but it’s why people who have figured out how to build whole schools that are much more sustainable give me hope,” she said.
The event, organized by the Center for Social Justice, was moderated by Jane Genster, Senior Counselor to the President and the Interim Executive Director of the CSJ.
The TFA founder visited the university in order to support student interest in the program and push for more recruitment from Georgetown.
“I’m interested in hearing where Georgetown grads minds are … to recruit all the more of them,” Kopp said in an interview with The Hoya.
Kopp’s passion for education began in college, when she proposed the idea of Teach For Today in her senior thesis.
“I somehow got into Princeton without realizing the depth of education inequity in this country,” she said.
The educational disparities across the United States became apparent to Kopp as she watched her freshman-year roommate, who attended high school in the Bronx, N.Y., struggle academically after inadequate schooling.
Kopp argued that fixing the American school system is crucial to reducing low urban graduation rates and providing better educational opportunities.
“These kids are showing up at schools that really were not built to meet their needs,” she said. “What you have to do with kids in that context takes super-heroic efforts.”
Kopp suggested a new mission for schools: that all students will be prepared for college. She believes this can be achieved through creating a culture that fosters passion for one’s education and provides extra academic assistance. She also called for the development of more charter schools, which she credited with giving students the tools for future success through their intensive structure.
Kopp focused on the importance of investment in the development of TFA teachers and the recruitment of well-qualified teachers, particularly those who share the ethnic and economic backgrounds of their students.
“When you do share their backgrounds, there is a potential power with that,” she said.
She challenged the perception that TFA volunteers are quick to become discouraged and that few become teachers as their permanent career.
“I actually don’t think it would be accurate to say that our people burn out,” she told The Hoya. “It’s a challenging experience, but it’s a motivating experience.”
Kopp argued that many students who leave the program choose other means to address problems in the educational system.
“There is really something indispensable about teaching in this context to creating change later on,” she said. “What we essentially need in the end is leaders in all of our schools, and in all levels of policy and in all sectors who know what you know after time in these schools.”
Students who attended appreciated the opportunity to better understand the problems in the American education system and pose their personal questions to Kopp.
“What she talked about was applicable for us in what we need to do to make this a better country,” Christine Park (COL ’12) said. “Basically, she laid out what’s wrong and where we come in.”
The members of TFA have a serious impact in their individual schools, but there is more work to be done, according to Kopp.
“The real question at the end of the day is: Are we changing the system?” she said. “It’s definitely too early to claim victory to that. Render no illusion that we can do that alone.”

The university will roll out a landlord pledge initiative starting early next week in an effort to protect students who live off campus while improving neighborhood relations.
In exchange for being recognized in an online list of university-approved landlords, those who sign the pledge will commit to maintaining their properties in compliance with D.C. law, licensing their properties with the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs and addressing issues affecting quality of life in the community.
The program will also allow the university to contact landlords who receive credible student complaints. Landlords who repeatedly fail to address these concerns will be publicly named on the Georgetown website.
University spokeswoman Stacy Kerr said that while the pledge does not represent a new strategy, the initiative is designed to hold landlords more accountable for the states of their properties.
“The goal is to hold landlords accountable,” she said. “We’re recognizing the student side of this and that landlords who are renting to students have to meet certain expectations.”
Kerr added that the pledge initiative is part of a broader effort by the university to address the concerns of students living off campus. She noted that Georgetown has taken steps to strengthen its relationship with the DCRA, the agency that regulates the properties students rent off campus.
“It’s great to see that [the DCRA] is taking this as seriously as we are. They’ve come on campus this fall and held office hours to meet with students with concerns,” she said.
Debbie Meritz Olsen, who owns four properties in Georgetown and Burleith rented by Georgetown students, was enthusiastic about the pledge.
“The pledge sets up a framework demonstrating a commitment by landlords to work in harmony with the local community and to maintain quality housing for Georgetown students that is also consistent with the residential standards in that local community,” she said.
Olsen said that, though she already adheres to the requirements outlined in the pledge, the framework will hold landlords accountable and allow them to hone their own reputations.
“You always want to maintain good relationships with the students. You want students to be able to seek you out, find you year after year, and [to] be known as a good and responsible landlord,” Olsen said. “The pledge is a terrific way to make clear to students and community that landlords who sign are committed to living up to these standards.”
Advisory Neighborhood Commission District 2E Commissioner Bill Starrels commended the university’s efforts to reinforce landlords’ responsibilities, but stressed that the D.C. government already has measures in place to hold landlords accountable.
“Obviously, reinforcing that landlords have to abide by D.C. [law] is a good thing. But every student that is looking to rent a house off campus should check the DCRA website to make sure that it has a license,” he said
Starrels has been a prominent advocate of accountability for Georgetown landlords since a fire at 3318 Prospect St. killed Daniel Rigby (MSB ’05) in 2004. The Hoya reported on Nov. 5, 2004 that D.C. fire inspectors said that the fire could have been prevented if the house had met certain safety standards.
But William Miller (SFS ’14) questioned whether the pledge would change rogue landlords’ behavior.
“This seems like a largely worthless measure for keeping landlords accountable. Those who sign the pledge are simply pledging to follow laws that are already on the books,” he said. “I guess it’s a start.”
Starrels said that he hopes the pledge will improve the security of students’ living conditions.
“Students have [the same right] as any other tenant of any other landlord to have [landlords] follow the rules,” he said.

With housing selection for the 2013 school year right around the corner, residence hall safety might be a determining factor on some students’ pros and cons lists when choosing a dorm.
According to the Department of Public Safety’s crime log, Reynolds Hall has the highest crime numbers with a total of 18 reported incidents, including theft, burglary and assault, between Jan. 1 and Oct. 17. This is significantly higher than other residence halls, such as Harbin Hall, the dorm with the second highest crime rate, which had 11 incidents since the beginning of the year.
Village C East, an upperclassmen dorm located behind Dahlgren Quadrangle, posted the lowest amount of crime, with one recorded incident since the beginning of 2011.
Yongmin Hwang (COL ’12), who lives in Reynolds, said that he thinks his hall’s upperclassmen population and its location in the back of campus contributes to its high crime rate.
“Honestly, I lived in Harbin freshman year, and I thought Harbin was more rowdy. Reynolds is quiet. The social life is less active than in freshman dorms,” he said. According to Hwang, the quieter role of Residence Assistants in upperclassmen dorms may make the buildings easier targets for illegal activity.
Harbin resident Caroline Epstein (SFS ’15) said that she trusts the dorm’s security measures but still tries to take extra precautions against crime.
“I feel pretty safe in Harbin, but I still lock my door,” she said. “Safety definitely plays a big role in which dorm we choose.”
According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, there has been an overall downward trend in crime on and near campus despite the number of residence hall incidents.
“Over the past several years we have worked hard to help make the University a safer place for our campus community,” she wrote in an email.
The university has implemented several safety measures to help address safety concerns, including a Community Action Team that helps students work with the university to address crime problems and a bike patrol program that allows greater coverage of campus and faster response times.
“The safety of our community is a top priority for us and we will continue to remind our students to be vigilant and notify DPS if they notice suspicious activities or individuals in or around our residence halls, apartments or townhouses,” Pugh said.

As a recent university composting initiative grows, campus environmental groups are looking ahead to implement more ambitious sustainability initiatives.
The collaborative effort between the Georgetown University Student Association, Eco-Action and Georgetown Energy is looking to begin the process of weatherizing university townhouses. Weatherization upgrades a house’s energy consumption and efficiency by installing insulating materials.
Colin Doyle (COL ’13), a member of Georgetown Energy, and Eco-Action Multimedia and Marketing Chair Madeleine Collins (COL ’13) are working with non-profit organization Weatherize DC to evaluate their own homes by the end of the spring semester. Once the GUSA sustainability committee and the Magis Row residents raise the necessary funds to assess the houses for a green upgrade, they will begin work. They also can begin reviewing other townhouses with consenting residents. Doyle plans to enter this phase by next summer.
According to Jessie Robbins (SFS ’12), GUSA’s secretary of sustainability, the effort hit a roadblock when the Old Georgetown Board objected to the replacement of wood window frames with fiberglass, an integral step in the weatherization process. Robbins said she is confident that the Board’s opposition will not be a major obstacle.
“We drive cars and don’t have to have a horse, so obviously we can have 21st century standards on some things,” Robbins said.
The coalition has had its most significant success so far in distributing compost bins to 30 student-owned houses located off-campus as part of an initiative that kicked off earlier this year. Participating residents fill their bins with compostable material and members of the Garden Club transport this material to a collection area in Doyle’s backyard. From there, it is transported to the Georgetown Community Gardens for composting.
Doyle hopes to expand the composting effort in the coming months to encompass the rest of the student-owned townhouses and to eventually move onto campus with a compost collection area near Kehoe Field.
Robbins said that the level of collaboration among student organizations toward sustainability projects is higher now than she has ever seen it during her time at Georgetown. In order to take advantage of this cohesiveness, she is working to bring together environmentally-minded students to brainstorm ideas for increasing sustainability in a forum set to be held in November.
Robbins hopes the creative input of students will eventually lead to the creation of a more detailed plan to boost environmental initiatives at Georgetown.
“This will be an incredible forum for student input and student ideas,” she said.

Students who attended Ann Coulter’s speech Thursday evening in Lohrfink Auditorium came with a range of expectations.
Some, like Dan Galloway (COL ’13) attended the event because they find Coulter entertaining. Sam Greco (SFS ’15), a moderate conservative, came to hear her comments on economic policy. Anwesha Banerjee (COL ’13), who identifies as a Democrat, said she came because of the controversy surrounding Coulter’s reputation as an outspoken commentator.
“There’s been so much talk about the controversial things she says on campus, so I wanted to hear what she was going to say,” Banjeree said.
Regardless of the mixed views of the students in the audience, Coulter kept the entire auditorium laughing. Exchanging sharp criticism of the Obama administration and what she called the “mainstream media” and the “liberal mob” with one-liners, Coulter discussed her political and social views.
“The Democrat solution to problems created by the government is more government. That’s like trying to sober up by having another drink — except that’s fun,” she said.
While Coulter kept the audience amused — not all of Coulter’s comments were met with unanimous laughter. When Coulter joked that Democrats favor Ronald Reagan because he appears gay, many audience members gasped in shock.
Galloway, who identifies Elas Roman Catholic and bisexual, called the comment homophobic while addressing Coulter during the Q-and-A session following the speech. Coulter defiantly denied any accusations of homophobia made by Galloway or other students, who called her out on her comment that traditional marriage between a man and women is best for raising children. In response, Coulter repeatedly asserted that she has gay friends with children.
Coulter also added that she believed the Constitution does not defend against discrimination based on sexual preference.
“Gays are exactly the opposite of blacks in terms of discrimination,” Coulter said. “We want blacks protected but we don’t want them in our neighborhoods, but we want gays in our neighborhoods, but we don’t want them protected.”
Another student who identified himself as an Arab Muslim and a proud American asked Coulter if she considered him a patriot, given his religious beliefs. Coulter answered that she did, but added, “I’m not saying all Arabs are terrorists, but of course you have to keep your eyes open after 9/11,” she said.
After the event concluded, Galloway stated he was not personally insulted by Coulter’s controversial words.
“I knew this is how her speech was going to be,” he said.
Greco, who said that he agreed with her position on economics, left with mixed feelings.
“She’s too extreme,” he said. “I’m afraid people will view her as the face of my party.”
