CW: This article discusses clerical sexual abuse. Please refer to the end of the article for on and off-campus resources.
Listening to survivors of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church is fundamental to making recommendations for change, survivors and experts say.
At the Nov. 16 virtual event, titled “Prière De Ne Pas Abuser (Please Do Not Abuse): Listening to the Voices of Survivors,” experts shed light on a newly released report on the rates of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church in France and the importance of listening to survivors. Clerical abuse survivor and Jesuit theologian Rev. Patrick Goujon, S.J., discussed his new book in the event hosted by Georgetown University’s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, which also featured panelist Laëtitia Atlani-Duault, a member of the 2021 French Independent Commission on Sexual Abuse in the Church.
The stigma around sexual abuse and lack of resources for support means the process of coming to terms with experiencing abuse is often an ongoing, life-long struggle, according to Goujon.
“When I decided to write this book, it was an answer to a necessity for me not to be lost in my own story. In a way, I have totally forgotten what happened to me. It has totally disappeared. And when it suddenly came back much later in my life, which was so disturbing, I was really lost,” Goujon said at the event. “It was at the same time really painful, but also a real gift. In fact, I decided to write not to be lost, but also not to lose what I was discovering.”
For Rev. Goujon, the shame of being abused was compounded with that of being a spiritual director, and the ‘physician heal thyself’ presumption that comes with the profession. 
“As a Jesuit trained and sent to be a spiritual director, one of the reasons for that was that I have a good capacity to understand my own life, to listen to people. So there was something intangible for me in that,” Rev. Goujon said at the event. 
Panelists also discussed a report by the Independent Commission on Sexual Abuse in the Church, comissioned by the Vatican itself, which estimated that clergy members in the Roman Catholic Church in France sexually abused over 200,000 minors over the last 70 years. According to Goujon, statistics on sexual abuse are hard to obtain or even estimate because many cases go unreported.
For many survivors, the guilt associated with sexual abuse and the lack of a support system for suvivors within the church makes it very difficult to seek help, according to Goujon. 
“At the very beginning, just a few weeks after I realized what happened to me, I spoke to my Jesuit spiritual director and he suggested me not to speak of it,” Goujon said. “It was certainly not the best advice I received in my Jesuit life, and it was a real sign of what usually happens.” 
The study conducted by the independent commission centered around listening to the stories of survivors rather than just analyzing cold statistics, according to Atlani-Duault.
“If you read the report it is full of the voices of victims. Each analysis is based on quotes that I selected, not only to have their voices represented but also to build our understanding of the phenomenon and our recommendations on the very specific testimonies of the victims,” Atlani-Duault said at the event. “What is clear in all the survivors’ testimonies is the fact that they were forced, and that they are now alone, facing long-term consequences of what happened.” 
The massive number of testimonies revealed not only the magnitude of clerical sexual abuse, but also the current necessity for a solution, according to Atlani-Duault.
“What is striking in our report is how these lonely experiences are massive, systematic and organized,” Atlani-Duault said. “They have been long covered by silence, displacement of abusers and the avoidance of the French Republic law system — and they are actual, it’s not just something from the past.”
Goujon said it is imperative the church actively listens to survivor’s stories.
“Even if you are not making a lot of noise, because someone who has suffered doesn’t shout, you have to listen to the very low side, the children, all of them, the adjuncts who have been victims,” Goujon said at the event. “The reason why I decided to make this story public is to encourage that.”Resources: On-campus resources include Health Education Services (202-687-8949) and Counseling and Psychiatric Service (202-687-7080); additional off-campus resources include the D.C.

Washington, D.C., saw its first hypothermia alert of the season Nov. 15, resulting in unhoused people being even more vulnerable to dangerous weather conditions.
The National Weather Service issued Washington, D.C.’s first overnight freeze warning of the season Nov. 3, while Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) activated the first hypothermia alert of the season Nov. 15. These announcements will be the first of many warnings issued as a result of low temperature and inclement weather throughout hypothermia season, which ends March 31. As a result, the District is taking steps to provide shelter for unhoused populations who are most at risk in the face of freeze advisories. 
Officials declare hypothermia warnings when the temperature, factored with the wind chill, is expected to be below 32 degrees Fahrenheit or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit with a 50% or greater chance of snow, rain or sleet. 
Bowser told District residents to look out for each other and said that the Shelter Hotline, a resource available to request transportation to shelters in the event of inclement weather, is always available for unhoused individuals, according to a press statement released just hours before the start of the hypothermia alert.
Hypothermia occurs when a person’s body temperature drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit, resulting in heart failure, organ failure and a shutdown of the respiratory system, which could lead to death when left untreated.
Following the first hypothermia alert issued Nov. 15, which was in effect from 7 p.m. until 7 a.m. the next morning, the District opened five men’s shelters and four women’s shelters at various public spaces, including recreation centers and public libraries throughout the District, so that unhoused people had a place to seek protection from the cold temperatures outside.
According to Curtis Smith, interim public affairs specialist at the D.C. Department of Human Services (DHS), a District-wide winter plan outlines how to protect unhoused District residents as temperatures lower. 
“DHS follows guidance from the Interagency Council of Homelessness’ FY22 Winter Plan to provide services to DC residents experiencing homelessness in hypothermic conditions,” Smith wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Resources available in the winter plan include services such as overnight warming sites, which allow unhoused individuals to seek a temporary break from cold temperatures, as well as transportation to shelters and meals. 
Staff and unhoused individuals at shelters must wear a mask regardless of vaccination status, and even though capacity in the shelters will exceed COVID-19 limits in an effort to accomodate more people, pre-pandemic capacity will not be allowed in an effort to protect staff, volunteers and clients.
The Hypothermia Outreach Team (HOT), a volunteer service provided by Georgetown University’s Center for Social Justice (CSJ), works on the ground to help unhoused individuals find shelter from the cold, according to Ray Shiu, deputy director of the CSJ. 
“In partnership with Georgetown Ministry Center (GMC) and other service providers throughout the city, HOT members conduct street outreach and serve to supplement and build capacity for outreach during the hypothermia season,” Shiu wrote in an email to The Hoya. “HOT volunteers help to prevent death from exposure and encourage unsheltered individuals experiencing homelessness to seek safety in available shelters.” 
There are about 6,380 unhoused people living in the District who will be directly exposed to freezing winter temperatures, which puts them at an increased risk for hypothermia and other freeze-induced injuries such as frostbite. During this past winter, seven unhoused individuals died as a result of conditions associated with hypothermia or exposure to the cold in the District, while 114 hypothermia alerts were called throughout the season. 
Based on the data from last year’s first hypothermia season during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is estimated that 1,500 men and 625 women will need individual beds for this winter’s hypothermia season. 
According to Shiu, aiding unhoused individuals who are struggling during the cold winter months is essential work. 
“This volunteer work is an important way for the Georgetown community to care for our own neighbors in need,” Shiu wrote.

Crowds of customers lined up outside Bakeshop, a new bakery in the Georgetown neighborhood, to get a first taste of the desserts for sale during the grand opening celebration. 
Justin Stegall, owner and founder of Bakeshop, opened the new storefront at 3210 Grace St. NW on Nov. 10 in the Grace Street Collective, a small market space that is home to a smoothie bowl shop, a coffeehouse and other small food and clothing shops. The bakery serves homemade cupcakes, cakes, macarons, pies and drinks.
The grand opening celebration, held Nov. 13, was a success, with many customers visiting the new storefront, according to Stegall.
“There are a lot of Georgetown students, which has been really cool, and the first few days have been nice,” Stegall said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’re just getting our feet wet and trying to understand the flow of things here because every time you open a store, each one is its own entity.” 
According to Eric Bolden, a customer who sampled a Vietnamese iced coffee, an assortment of cookies and some macarons, everything tasted delicious but the macarons were the standout.
“I took a macaron cooking class in Paris, and these are the best,” Bolden said in an interview with The Hoya. “They’re the closest thing to what I’ve had in France.” 
Stegall started his baking career in the kitchen of his mom’s house, eventually leading to the opening of the first Bakeshop location in Arlington, Va., in 2010, followed by a Falls Church, Va. location in 2019. Opening a location in Georgetown was always the ultimate goal, according to Stegall, who has been trying to obtain a storefront in the neighborhood since the start of his business.
“I was looking for space in Georgetown 12 years ago but was just never able to find a spot,” Stegall said. “It’s always been in the back of my mind to do something here, and then this space became available.” 
The COVID-19 pandemic hit shortly after the opening of the Falls Church location, forcing Bakeshop to continue operations by offering takeout services for cakes and deliveries to local hospitals. 
Takeout sales allowed the bakery to remain open while abiding by public health restrictions, according to Stegall. 
“We went through all the precautions, and we were lucky to get through it, and what really saved us was the fact that we’re mostly a takeout business,” Stegall said. “We don’t rely on people to sit inside and eat, so we were able to continue to do business throughout the whole thing just by limiting people in the shop.”
Regular customers from other Bakeshop locations came to celebrate both the new location and Bakeshop’s survival through the pandemic, according to Alyson Fligg, an employee at Bakeshop.
“It has been a fun day,” Fligg said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is our celebration of opening, so we have seen a really nice crowd, and a lot of our regular customers from around the area have come to see us.” 
Rohan Agarwal, who came from Arlington, Va., to celebrate the grand opening, was excited to have a new dessert option in the area.
“I feel like a lot of the bakeries in Georgetown are mainly cupcakes,” Agarwal said in an interview with The Hoya. “Bakeshop has a bunch of variety, and their macarons are the best ever.”
Northern Virginia Magazine declared Bakeshop the winner in the Bakery/Patisserie category for its Best of NoVa 2021: Food feature, applauding its vegan options, ice cream cookie sandwiches and macarons. 
According to Stegall, employees having the opportunity to interact with the local community is an integral part of the Bakeshop experience.
“I love working with students, so I’m excited to employ some Georgetown students here,” Stegall said. “We have a lot of kids from high school to college to just out of college who work here, and it’s a nice collective group.”
Stegall looks forward to connecting with the Georgetown community by providing high-quality and delicious dessert options at Bakeshop.
“We do it the right way,” Stegall said. “We take a lot of pride in it, and everything is top-notch.”

A new grocery store in Ward 8 opened last week as part of a program to alleviate food deserts in Washington, D.C. neighborhoods. 
Good Food Markets (GFM) opened a new location Nov. 13 at 4001 S Capitol St. SW in the Bellevue neighborhood of Ward 8, which has a population of 80,517 people and the lowest median household income in the District. Good Food Markets is only the second grocery store in the entire ward.
The grocery store is part of a larger initiative to end food insecurity in the District and provide healthy food options in all neighborhoods. Through the Neighborhood Prosperity Fund, a program launched by Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) that supports development projects in low-income neighborhoods, the city allocated $880,000 for a grocery store in Ward 8. 
Good Food Markets will help alleviate some of the concerns regarding food insecurity in Ward 8 and act as a starting point for the addition of more healthy food options in the area, according to Bowser in a Nov. 13 press statement.
“Today, with the opening of this Good Food Markets, we’re making good on a promise to deliver more grocery stores and food access points to neighborhoods east of the river,” Bowser said in the press statement. “And there’s more on the way — more grocers, more restaurants, more financial support for neighbors with the passion and talent to start their own food businesses.”
Food deserts — geographic areas where the nearest grocery store is over 0.5 miles away and over 40% of households have no vehicle available — make up 11% of the entire District. Ward 8 alone contains 51% of the District’s food deserts. Food insecurity worsened in the District during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 250,000 additional people facing hunger, making it even more difficult for low-income individuals living in food deserts to access meals.
According to Philip Sambol, executive director of Good Food Markets, the company chose the Bellevue neighborhood because of its distance from reliable, healthy and affordable food options. 
“GFM’s mission is to improve food access and community health,” Sambol wrote in an email to The Hoya. “When we looked at available locations that were potentially viable from the business perspective, and would be meeting a real need for fresh food, S Capitol was a good fit.”
According to John Falcicchio, deputy mayor for planning and economic development, in the press statement, the projects that result from the Neighborhood Prosperity Fund will help more District residents who are currently facing food insecurity.  
“Increasing access to healthy food options east of the river and creating jobs for local residents remain a top priority,” Falcicchio said in the press statement. “Projects such as this exemplify how we continue to collaborate amongst district agencies, developers, and the community to deliver essential amenities, such as Good Food Market, and opportunities for residents to thrive in the District.”
It is not just about having access to food, however, but it is also about providing healthy, fresh and educational options, which Good Food Markets aims to do at their new Ward 8 location, according to Sambol. 
“It is our hope that the new GFM location will make it easier for people in Bellevue and Washington Highlands to purchase fresh produce and basic groceries, increasing consumption of fresh food and improving the health of residents,” Sambol wrote. “We also work with a variety of organizations to provide fun and educational events in the community so people can gain new skills for cooking at home and leading an active lifestyle.” 
According to Bowser in the press statement, the new Good Food Markets location, as well as the other projects within the Neighborhood Prosperity Fund, will give opportunities to D.C. residents formerly impacted by food insecurity.
“What we’re doing, one project at a time, is giving more Washingtonians the fair shot they deserve,” Bowser said in the press statement.

The increased spread of misinformation on social media is a threat to democracy, experts said at a Nov. 15 event. 
At the online event, titled “Truth and the Rise of Popular Lies,” political experts outlined how political imagery has allowed misinformation to thrive, as well as steps policymakers should take to regulate social media platforms to protect against the influence of disinformation. This event was co-sponsored by Georgetown University’s Free Speech Project and the Future of the Humanities Project, a research initiative that examines the impact of the humanities on public life, as a part of the Free Speech at the Crossroads: International Dialogues series. 
The event was moderated by Sanford J. Ungar, director of the Free Speech Project, and Michael Scott, director of the Future of the Humanities Project, and featured panelists Baroness Jenny Randerson, a member of the British House of Lords since 2012; John Battle, a British Labor Party politician who chairs the Justice and Peace Commission of the Diocese of Leeds; Erica Green, an award-winning correspondent in the Washington, D.C. bureau of The New York Times; and Stephen Hess, a senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institution in D.C.
The lines between fact and falsehood have shifted over the past decade, according to Randerson. 
“What we have now is something that goes way beyond the occasional acts, way beyond what we used to call ‘labor spin’ under Tony Blair,” Randerson said at the event. “Now we have a situation where, when we’re told things, we really have no idea as to whether they’re true or not because breaking promises and failing to tell the whole truth have become a modus operandi.” 
The blurred lines between fact and falsehood are a consequence of the value shift from service and honesty to notoriety among politicians, according to Battle. 
“Politicians are now encouraged to be dramatic personalities or pragmatists, if you like. Distraction politics is a key kind of theme,” Battle said at the event. “So performance has become more important than actual competence and again, it was the image, not the reality, of competence. So I think that notion of survival started to get buried into the political system, so politicians are about their own survival.”
Celebrity politics and the use of fame to influence political opinion have reached new heights during the age of social media. Many politicians have sought to amass large social media followings in order to shape public discourse around political issues, according to a study by the American Political Science Association.
Social media has increased the long-term impacts of the dissemination of false information, according to Green.
“It feels like there’s just nothing that you can do to really overcome that and the damage is so lasting,” Green said at the event. “On social media in particular, when we think about even the coverage of the Jan. 6 insurrection, a lot of what was put out by Republican lawmakers still lives on.”
Social media platforms have amplified fake news and empowered disruptive voices in society, according to a February 2020 study by The Ohio State University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The study found that social media platforms have the potential to influence civic engagement due to a lack of government regulation.
The federal government needs to update regulation around social media to moderate the spread of disinformation, according to Hess. 
“We also have to worry about getting misinformation, lies out of the system. I don’t think we do a very good job of that. And we have to give more thought to that,” Hess said at the event. “In other words, we had the same situation back in the 1920s when there was suddenly the burgeoning of radio and the federal government passed a national radio act and it expanded to cover television and you apply for a license and if you don’t follow certain rules, you could lose your license.”
In recent years, some politicians have voiced support for regulating misinformation on social media platforms. The Biden administration has advocated for the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which has allowed social media sites to avoid being held liable for their content. The administration has not taken any steps toward formally repealing the section, however.
Politicians must do more to combat the effects of disinformation, according to Battle. 
“It’s always much easier to have an intense politics of fear, demonize your opponent, go for ad hominem arguments and get the person rather than the policy,” Battle said. “And that generates that permanent campaigning style that’s incredibly negative, and I think that makes it very difficult to introduce any longer term vision of where we’re going or have a political conversation that actually opens up complex questions that might not have immediate answers.”

Black-owned restaurants participated in promotions and special deals for Washington, D.C.-Maryland-Virginia (DMV) Black Restaurant Week.
Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) declared Nov. 7 to 14 as the 2021 DMV Black Restaurant Week, a promotion to encourage customers to support Black-owned restaurants in the DMV area. Over 80 restaurants with Black owners took part in the event, offering dine-in, takeout and delivery promotions, as well as special menu items, throughout the week. According to a Nov. 7 press statement from Bowser, the promotional week is designed to advertise and support the many Black-owned businesses in the area.
Jennifer Meltzer, managing partner at one of the participating restaurants, All Set Restaurant & Bar in Silver Spring, Md., noticed an increase in business throughout the week because customers wanted to come for their special promotional menu.
“We definitely got people saying, ‘We knew you were participating in Black Restaurant Week, and we came for your Black Restaurant Week menu,’” Meltzer said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Any time our elected public officials back community events, it’s going to get more awareness, so I think that’s awesome.” 
DMV Black Restaurant Week started in 2018 after Black business owners and entrepreneurs were racially profiled and unjustly taxed, and it is now the only Black restaurant week officially endorsed by Bowser. 
According to Chelsea Xeron, owner of Niko’s Spiked Gelato in the District, supporting local Black-owned businesses is especially important in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought difficulties for many businesses.  
“I think initiatives like this are extremely important, especially now during the pandemic,” Xeron said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I think businesses, not only Black-owned but all small businesses, need help and support, and they need support from the communities.”
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the temporary or permanent closure of more than 43% of businesses in the District, and revenue at small business decreased by over 61% from March 2020 to March 2021. 
According to Meltzer, by declaring one week DMV Black Restaurant Week, Bowser allows businesses to focus their promotional efforts within a specific time frame. 
“I think concentrated efforts on well thought out promotions are better,” Meltzer said. “I think quality over quantity, but I certainly do think there’s a place for these kinds of promotions.”
During DMV Black Restaurant Week, Bowser announced that $9 million in grants through the Food Access Fund were available to help expand food options, eliminate food deserts and increase employment opportunities in Wards 7 and 8, where food insecurity is a problem for many low-income individuals. 
The grants will help to ensure that everyone in the District has access to reliable food sources, as well as provide the opportunity for business owners to start new restaurants and businesses, according to Bowser in a Nov. 8 press statement.
“We have an incredible amount of entrepreneurial talent and creativity in DC, especially in our restaurant and foodservice industries — it’s just not equally distributed or equally funded,” Bowser said in the press statement. “The Food Access Grants are going to change that.” 
Bowser’s endorsement of DMV Black Restaurant Week helps to change the false stereotypes surrounding Black-owned restaurants and prove that they are successful and valuable to District residents, according to Xeron.  
“I think that people tend to see Black-owned businesses and Black-owned restaurants as kind of subpar and say, ‘Oh, they might need some help,’” Xeron said. “But to have the mayor behind it and to legitimize the movement makes it that much better.”
While DMV Black Restaurant Week was a success, customers should not limit their support of Black-owned restaurants to one week per year, according to Meltzer.
“I think it’s great when people come visit us during Black Restaurant Week, but I would encourage everyone to seek out ethnic-independent family restaurants and support them all year long,” Meltzer said.

The Georgetown University graduate student body is voting this week on a referendum to permanently include the School of Continuing Studies (SCS) in the Georgetown University Graduate Student Government (GradGov).
The referendum, open for voting from Nov. 15 to Nov. 22, would ensure full participation of the SCS in all GradGov affairs, thereby allowing SCS students to attend all GradGov events, run for executive positions and join committees in the bodies’ senate. The referendum needs a two-thirds majority to pass, with a minimum of 20% of the student population voting.
SCS students are excited about the prospect of being fully involved in GradGov, according to SCS student David Zumbrennen (GRD ’23), a member of the senate leadership committee. 
“The enthusiasm of SCS students to be a part of GradGov is out there,” Zumbrennen said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “There are students who want to give back to the community and GradGov is a great avenue for them to do that and make sure all the programs are represented and as a whole it makes Georgetown better.”
Despite outside responsibilities, SCS students are still motivated to participate in student government to enact change, according to SCS student and GradGov Senator Teresa Garcia Bautista (GRD ’23).
“We are just so involved,” Bautista said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “It shows the dedication that we have towards not only our programs but the whole Georgetown community.”
SCS students’ differing professional backgrounds provide a strong asset to GradGov and an unexplored perspective, according to Zumbrennen. 
“It is kind of an untapped source of individuals who may have run their own business before,” Zumbrennen said. “We’ve got individuals working in amazing jobs and amazing places with great experience.” 
In addition to differing professional backgrounds, most SCS students do not attend class or live on Georgetown’s main campus. The SCS, which offers graduate programs in professional and liberal studies, is located in downtown Washington, D.C., away from the main campus. Many SCS students also take online classes and are located all over the world. 
The geographic difference between the SCS and Georgetown’s other schools played a large role in the school’s past exclusion from GradGov, but the virtual learning environment caused GradGov leaders to rethink the SCS’s involvement, according to GradGov President Jonah Klempner (LAW ’22).
“SCS has a majority online graduate community, and their graduate students live all over the world,” Klempner wrote in a text message to The Hoya. “COVID broke down those geographic barriers and had everyone scratching their heads as to why SCS wasn’t originally part of GradGov.”
The student body referendum follows a GradGov senate vote on Sept. 17 on the issue, in which the GradGov senate formally approved adding the SCS to GradGov’s purview. Currently, the SCS is included in GradGov on a probationary period, which is set to expire in December. 
As part of the probationary period, SCS students could run for 44 seats allotted to the SCS in the GradGov senate as part of GradGov’s September 2021 elections. In total, 42 of the 44 seats were filled after over 70 students ran for seats, according to Klempner. 
Under the probationary inclusion of the SCS, students have already been able to participate in additional programs and make connections with others, according to Bautista. 
“The inclusion has been a huge success and a huge step going forward for all the graduate students being able to connect all the graduate students and programs that maybe people weren’t aware of,” Bautista said.
Prior to the SCS’s participation in GradGov, students had no representatives to voice concerns to, making it difficult to enact change, according to Zumbrennen. 
“I think for those that were within Georgetown they probably did feel marginalized and like their voices weren’t being heard,” Zumbrennen said. “Whether you are in your school or in your community, everyone wants to feel like their voice is being heard.”
While the referendum’s results will not be released until after voting closes, the SCS’s inclusion has already benefited students and GradGov representation will continue to support SCS students, according to Bautista. 
“I really hope everyone votes,” Bautista said. “I don’t know if we are going to pass it or not. I have faith. I really think it’s going to be so beneficial for the students.”

Healthy food options will increase for low-income Washington, D.C. residents as a supplemental food assistance program gains new leadership.
FRESHFARM, a nonprofit organization that focuses on food sustainability and operates farmers markets throughout the D.C. region, will now manage the Produce Plus program, a city initiative to provide locally grown, fresh produce to D.C. residents facing food insecurity. The program gives enrolled and eligible District residents a stipend to spend on healthy fruits and vegetables at participating vendors.
The combination of FRESHFARM and the Produce Plus program will expand food equity in the District, according to a Nov. 11 press release from Nick Stavely, incentive programs director at FRESHFARM. 
“DC Health’s Produce Plus Program is one of the most progressive and generous programs of its kind in the entire country,” Stavely said in the press release. “FRESHFARM sees this as an opportunity to take this significant investment by the government of the District of Columbia and expand upon it by working with private and public funders to improve food access and strengthen our regional food system.”
Currently, all FRESHFARM farmers markets can be used by individuals enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a federal nutrition program that provides funds for food to low-income families and individuals, providing opportunities for low-income individuals to purchase healthy, fresh and sustainable food with their SNAP benefits.
In its new role, FRESHFARM aims to expand food access and education opportunities for low-income District residents, according to Juliet Glass, director of communications and marketing at FRESHFARM. 
“FRESHFARM will implement an evidence-based, multi-level nutrition intervention at farmers’ markets across the city to improve food retail environments, food access, and nutrition security for residents with low incomes,” Glass wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Over 16% of District residents experience food insecurity, while about 11% of the District can be characterized as a food desert because of residents’ low incomes, lack of close proximity to a grocery store or lack of a vehicle.
According to Glass, FRESHFARM will work to improve food accessibility for District residents through its leadership in the Produce Plus program.
“FRESHFARM has long been committed to increasing food security and decreasing rates of diet-related illnesses in communities across the city,” Glass wrote.
Still, there is more work to be done to make healthy food more accessible in the District, and FRESHFARM aims to work toward a more equitable food system by starting new distribution services and initiatives, according to Glass.
“As the new administrators of Produce Plus – FRESHFARM will work to increase redemption of incentives, offer home delivery, and connect District residents with additional federal and local food access programs across the city,” Glass wrote. 
The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated already severe issues of food insecurity in the District. Before the pandemic, there were 400,000 individuals facing hunger; now that number is over 650,000.  
According to Glass, while the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the food crisis in the District, the Produce Plus program hopes to resolve some of the heightened disparities in food accessibility. 
“COVID-19 continues to impact rates of food security in the District, particularly among residents aged 60+, children, undocumented individuals, and unhoused individuals,” Glass wrote. 
In previous years, D.C. Greens, a local nonprofit working to advance food equity, managed the Produce Plus program, eventually including 19 vendors in which members of the Produce Plus program could shop for groceries. 
According to Glass, FRESHFARM’s participation in the Produce Plus program will work toward more equitable food opportunities in the District. 
“The city’s Produce Plus program aims to create long-term system changes and solutions to ensure that every resident has meaningful access to healthy, affordable, and culturally appropriate fruits and vegetables,” Glass wrote.

Howard University students have ended their takeover of a campus building after a monthlong protest demanding university action over unsafe living conditions on campus.
Protesters and university administrators reached an agreement Nov. 15, but the details of the negotiations have not been made publicly available. Since Oct. 12, students had been occupying the inside and outside of the Armour J. Blackburn University Center, demanding the university address student safety concerns after reports of poor ventilation, mold, leaking pipes, pests and mushrooms growing from ceilings in university residence halls.
The issues current Howard students are facing are not new, according to Mohamed Jalloh, a former student at Howard who distributed food and warm drinks to protesters last week while the takeover was still ongoing.
“We had rats, you know, I’m saying — some people complained about mold and stuff in their dorms but it was one of those things where you kind of just lived with it,” Jalloh said in an interview with The Hoya. “I would say that I’m not sure if this is just a Howard thing or not. But the water in the dorm was so harsh that I ended up losing all my eyebrows during the school year.”
According to Alexis Harper, a graduate student at Howard and an advisor to students participating in the takeover, pressure from the media and graduates forced the university to act.
“I think it was, from my perspective, the intense social pressure from the students being there for 34 days, in addition to the physical support that they had of alumni and organizers coming through,” Harper said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
The protest was organized by Howard students involved in The Live Movement, a coalition of current and former students fighting for the advancement of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Black students. During the takeover, The Live Movement regularly posted updates, asked for food and supply donations and streamed live on its Instagram account.
The Live Movement did not provide comment before the time of publication.
Prior to the negotiations, student activists had demanded an in-person town hall with Howard President Wayne A. I. Frederick and other university administrators before the end of October. The other requests included legal and disciplinary immunity for all participants of the takeover and an official housing plan to address the unsafe conditions.
Protesters also demanded that student, graduate and faculty voting power be reinstated to the university board of trustees. In June, the university announced it would phase out student, graduate and faculty voting power from the board of trustees after completing a review, consulting an outside firm and interviewing over 40 campus community members. Now it is up to Howard to abide by the agreement, according to Harper.
Administrators asked students to stop the takeover of the building Oct. 13, warning of disciplinary consequences, including expulsions, according to an email sent to Howard students by Interim Student Affairs Vice President Cynthia Evers. Students who participated in the takeover have now been granted academic immunity, according to Harper.
The contents of the agreement are confidential, according to Harper.
“There wasn’t an explicit agreement reached regarding the board of trustees issue,” Harper said. “Then there are some apparently things going on with housing and the upcoming town hall, but the exact details — because it was a legal agreement — are confidential.”
Frederick said he is pleased with the agreement.
“I am pleased to share with you today that through ongoing dialogue and a desire to hear and address their concerns the student protesters have agreed to end the Blackburn occupation and leave the building,” Frederick said in a video statement.
Harper said it is up to Howard to follow through on the agreement.
“It seems like the implementation — it’s a watch-and-see situation, with how the university chooses to implement the agreements that were reached,” Harper said.
The protests will have a lasting impact on the university community, Jalloh said.
“What they’re doing is incredible,” Jalloh said. “I think that what they’re doing is going to make a change and I’m hoping what they’re doing is actually going to make a difference for generations to come.”
