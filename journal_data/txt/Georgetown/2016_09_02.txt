Georgetown will undertake a series of efforts in order to reconcile with its slaveholding past, including providing descendants of the 272 slaves whose sale in 1838 benefitted the university an advantage in admissions applications.
The measures, announced by University President John J. DeGioia at an event in Gaston Hall yesterday afternoon, come after a year of work by the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation charged by DeGioia last September.
DeGioia said the working group’s progress over the past year and the university’s future actions reflect the important role of Georgetown as a university.
“Every so often we are reminded of why we chose a life in the academy. Ours institutionally is a life directed by purpose, a mission. We are committed to the formation of young people, to the inquiry of our faculty and through our institutional agency to contributing to the common good,” DeGioia said. “We recognize that we share responsibility of this place.”
The admissions advantage is one of a series of recommendations included in the working group’s report submitted to DeGioia in June; he announced the approval of a series of recommendations yesterday. In a campuswide email sent Thursday morning, DeGioia said the university would formally apologize for its slaveholding history in a Mass of Reconciliation held with the Archdiocese of Washington and the Society of Jesus in the United States.
The university will also rename Freedom and Remembrance Halls as Isaac Hall – named after the first enslaved person named in records of the 1838 sale – and Anne Marie Becraft Hall – named after a Catholic sister and educator in the Georgetown neighborhood during the 19th century.
Within 24 hours of a student-led demonstration last November, DeGioia approved the working to change the names of then-recently opened Mulledy and McSherry Halls to Freedom and Remembrance Halls, respectively. The halls were previously named after former University Presidents Fr. Thomas Mulledy, S.J., who authorized the sale of the 272 slaves to a Louisiana plantation in 1838, and Fr. William McSherry, S.J., who served as Mulledy’s lawyer in the sale.
As part of efforts to engage the community and raise awareness, the university will establish an Institute for the Study of Slavery and its Legacies to research and teach about slavery and engage with descendants of the 272 slaves.
Other measures announced by DeGioia yesterday include developing formal memorials on campus recognizing the 272 slaves, increased engagement with descendants of the 272 and increasing diversity at the university.
In an interview with The Hoya, DeGioia said the recommendation in the report to increase diversity is a continuation of work the university has already begun.
“We’ve been doing that intentionally for more than 40 years. [The report] reminds us how important it is to sustain this,” DeGioia said.
The recommended timeline for completing these recommendations is unclear, according to history professor Fr. David Collins, S.J., who led the working group. However, a director for the institute has already been appointed.
The working group has been disbanded since the report’s submission.
According to DeGioia, establishing the institute and memorials is part of a larger effort to engage the Georgetown community with its slaveholding past.
“The biggest surprise … when I sent out the letter informing people we were going to establish this Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation is that people were surprised,” DeGioia said. “There were folks who did not know that history. And for me, we’ve got to ensure that this history — it’s alive, it’s living here.”
DeGioia said the university’s decision to provide descendants of the slaves sold by Georgetown with an admissions edge, rather than special financial support, is rooted in the university’s existing admission policies. The admissions advantage will operate similarly to admission for legacy students.
“We give care and attention to members of the Georgetown community, faculty, staff, alumni. We have an enduring engagement with the university,” DeGioia said. “We will give that same care and attention to the children of descendants, but our policies on scholarships are guided by the university commitment to need-blind admission and meeting full need.”
The working group also suggested a scholarship eligible for descendants of the 272 slaves in its report.
Patricia Bayonne-Johnson, a descendent of one of the 272 slaves, said she questions whether if the gesture will have the desired effect. Bayonne-Jonson said other universities should follow Georgetown’s lead.
“Some of them, it’s an offer but it’s something they could not or would not take advantage of. I think probably it would serve them better if this edge could be extended to people who want to attend any institution, say Xavier University,” Bayonne-Johnson said.
Adjunct professor Richard America, who is an expert on reparations, said the university’s recognition of the descendants as members of the Georgetown community is welcome, but that the greatest potential lies in the institute.
“That’s a microgesture,” America said. “What we really have an opportunity to do is impact big-level thinking on the whole race problem that affects 350 million people in this country, in one way or another — and by the way, globally, so 7 billion people around the world — because the same concepts apply.”
Collins said Georgetown’s role as a university made the development of an Institute for the Study of Slavery and its Legacies a natural response on how best to engage with troubling parts of the university’s history.
“We’re a university, so if we’re going through this process as a university, and in the manner of a university, what are the resources that are intrinsic to a university as a university that give us prompts in to how to engage with this archival? Well, to have an institute for the study of slavery,” Collins said.
Georgetown will rely on philanthropic support to fund the recommendations — including the new institute — according to DeGioia.
“There are substantial investments that are going to be required here. And I’m very confident that the philanthropic community, that I know very well, will be of support to us as we move forward in this work,” DeGioia said.
Some of the recommendations will require significant financial investment by the university. But Collins said some of the least expensive recommendations stand to make the greatest impact.
“In one sense it’s the one with the smallest price tag but it’s the one that could be potentially the most meaningful and that’s the apology,” Collins said.
Collins said the working group spent substantial time considering what it would mean for the university to make an apology.
“How do you figure out who’s apologizing to whom? How do you ensure that you can’t just spout an apology into the breeze — you want it to be in the context of a relationship — how do you build a relationship?” Collins said.
Symbolic gestures, like the apology, will be just as substantive as more concrete actions, according to DeGioia.
“We want to offer an apology in a manner that is consistent with our Catholic resources available to us in seeking reconciliation, so a symbolic moment, there will be a mass, but it will also be a living moment,” DeGioia said. “So I don’t want to be too locked into symbol and substance. Some of the symbols are deeply substantive, and some of the substance is deeply symbolic.”
In June, DeGioia met with Bayonne-Johnson in Spokane, Wash., in a private meeting, making history as the first reported university president in the United States to meet with a descendant of one of the slaves who worked at or was sold by the university. Since then, DeGioia has met with more than 50 descendants of the 272 slaves — one of the symbolic efforts recommended by the working group. These meetings have played a significant role in his response to the report, according to DeGioia.
“Any words you hear me say, including what we’ve talked about today, have been in some way informed by conversations with descendants,” DeGioia said. “They’ve also been informed by scholarship and conversations with a broad range of folks.”
Georgetown’s actions are more extensive than any other university — including Brown University and the University of Virginia — confronting a similar history, according to The New York Times. However, Collins said the knowledge that the working group’s work could influence the action of other universities had little impact on the working group’s discussions.
“With the dimensions that are particular to the way that universities can engage with this for the first time, I guess I could never have predicted other universities would find our experience helpful, but they have,” Collins said.
Connor Maytnier (COL ’17), who was one of the students in the working group, said he hopes Georgetown’s work sparks similar efforts at other universities.
“Georgetown is really dedicating itself as a force for change in our current world and in our current environment and looking at these modern manifestations of the institution of slavery,” Maytnier said. “I think that you can only hope that this sparks a movement and that you have these other leaders – particularly in education from some of these elite universities – that could latch on to this.”
But for descendants like Bayonne-Johnson, Georgetown’s efforts may have a much more personal impact.
“I was very moved by Dr. DeGioia’s speech,” Bayonne-Johnson said. “It gave me great hope and faith that something will come of it.”

While well intentioned, I can’t help but view this gesture as a reactionary maneuver to publicly display the university’s social justice credentials rather than solving any particular problem.
The amount of resources dedicated to this endeavor would have been better spent economizing on bureaucratic excess to avoid tuition increases and, most importantly, adapting to the economic realites that degrade the value of college degrees now and in the future.
The slavery issue is important, but is one of many disturbing injustices committed in the context of American history concerning other groups of people and the Catholic Church.
The posture of GU appears like an appeasement to groups dominating headlines recently rather than an organic effort to identify current problems at the University and actually fix them.  It’s hard not to be skeptical of the intent here.

JaneHoya says

100% agreed with JoeHoya. The university continues to focus on asinine headlines versus real, hard issues the school faces. The school called and asked for money this year. I said fix their tuition problem and call me back.

Although the action by the university is small in size and scope, it sets a significantly poor precedent.  The protests from the holier than thou crowd would appear to be requests for handouts under the thinly veiled guise of self-righteousness.  For those supporters not directly receiving a handout, it is sad to see their general lack of intellectual and moral maturity.  Judging the past through the lense of today’s ethics is all too easy…and I suspect that you too will be judged morally inferior by future generations.  The cycles of reparations are nearly endless if one continues on a logical course.  Otherwise, one merely makes an arbitrary stopping point…and I would add that when everyone involved is dead, their kids/grnadkids/greatgrandkids are dead, common sense would say that it’s time to move on (or else I am demanding free tuition at Oxford for the UK’s invasion of the US in 1812).  Because this type of thinking and action is at best impossible to achieve and more likely, destructive, the legal, moral, and ethical code that is generally accepted by civilization is that one is not guilty for the sins of their father.  Holding onto the past is exactly why tribal and ethnic conflicts in Africa, the middle East, etc stew indefinitely.  The best policy towards the past is to recognize that it has past and to move onward, learning from mistakes.

After months of deliberation, the university filed the finalized version of the 2017-2036 Campus Plan with the District of Columbia Zoning Commission for its consideration and approval yesterday, solidifying a plan that prioritizes upperclassman student housing renovations, allows the renovation or construction of academic spaces in four different parts of campus and permits the renovation or replacement of Yates Field House and Kehoe Field.
The plan also includes commitments to sustainability in new constructions and allows for expansions of MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, including a new surgical pavilion.
The Georgetown Community Partnership — consisting of university administrators, neighborhood representatives and students — approved the final iteration of the plan July 25 after reviewing approximately 75 edits suggested by the public.
The plan, which is the District’s formal structure for universities in residential areas to predict their future enrollments and developments, was published June 6 and available for a month long period of review until July 15.
During the period, the university asked students and community members to submit questions and comments through a formal, online feedback system and held several meetings to discuss feedback. The period for public comment was extended from July 6 to July 15.
The campus plan will take effect after the D.C. Zoning Commission holds hearings in January.
Vice President for Government Relations and Community Engagement Christopher Murphy (GRD ’98) said a plan to demolish a wing of St. Mary’s Hall was eliminated due to concerns raised during the evaluation period, but that most of the other alterations made to the plan were clerical in nature.
“The changes made to the draft plan were fairly modest,” Murphy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This is a real credit to community, university and student leaders on the Georgetown Community Partnership whose work drafting the initial draft of the plan contemplated many of the concerns and priorities of the numerous stakeholders.”
The GCP was formed in 2012 as part of the implementation of the 2010 Campus Plan, following a lengthy legal battle between various Georgetown community associations and the university during the plan’s negotiations. The 2010 plan put into effect various policies unpopular with students, including a three-year on-campus housing requirement, the Student Neighborhood Assistance Program to monitor off-campus noise violations and construction of new residences — including Pedro Arrupe, S.J. Residence Hall — instead of prioritizing existing housing renovations.
The Georgetown University Student Association formed the “Let’s Not Get Screwed Again” petition in an effort to rally student support in spring 2015 around a new campus plan.
GUSA Chief of Staff Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), who helped negotiate the campus plan, said he is confident the final version of the plan will be approved because it was written through a consensus-based process.
“I expect the commission will be very happy to see that it’s a consensus document, submitted jointly by all the parties,” Goldstein said. “I’m not personally a part of the zoning commission process, but from what I understand it’s going to be smooth-sailing going forward.”
Goldstein said another significant change Georgetown made to the campus plan was codifying the role of two to three student leaders in the GCP steering committee so that it will be permanent over the next 20 years.
GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’18), Reed Howard (COL ’17) and Mara Goldman (SFS ’19) currently serve as student representatives to the steering committee.
“It ensures that all the hard work we’ve put into the campus planning process over the past two years will be codified for the next twenty years,” Goldstein wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m confident that we won’t be shut out of the room again like we were during the process leading up to the 2010 Campus Plan.”
Khan said the plan solves many problems that arose from the 2010 plan.
“With the last campus plan, the biggest issue was the construction of the new dorms to accommodate additional students on campus,” Khan said. “We spent north of $70 million on the construction of those dorms and as a result, we have accumulated quite a large deferred maintenance log to the point where some of our upperclassman housing options were abysmal.”
Vice President of Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said the campus plan ensures that students will be part of the conversation in years to come and will also benefit students by elevating housing options.
“Students played a critical and constructive role in the development of the campus plan which commits to continued student engagement in ongoing conversations about campus and neighborhood life,” Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Students will also benefit from the planned renovations in the existing residential housing stock making on-campus housing an attractive and competitive choice.”
Vice President of the Citizens Association of Georgetown Jennifer Altemus Romm said the plan received major support because of the engagement of the Georgetown neighborhood in the plan’s formulation.
“I was able to actively participate in drafting the new Campus Plan so there were no surprises when the plan was released in June,” Altemus Romm wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Through the GCP, the university was able to work with the community, the students and MedStar to address all issues. And in this same group we can collegially resolve problems as they arise. CAG is excited to move forward with the plan and we fully support it.”
Morey said the plan received the unanimous endorsement of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, ANC 3D, the Citizens Association of Georgetown, the Burleith Citizens Association and the Foxhall Community Citizens Association.
“Since the draft plan was released in early June, response from community members from the neighborhoods surrounding campus has been overwhelmingly positive,” Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Khan said successful cooperation on the plan between neighbors, administrators and students demonstrates how effective the GCP model is.
“I think certainly that this could be a model for other universities that are struggling with their process, American University being one for example,” Khan said. “Ultimately, we didn’t get screwed again. The students were really treated as partners in the process, and as a result we were able to come to a consensus agreement that benefited all parties, as opposed to one over the other.”

Twenty-one Ward 3 residents in Washington, D.C., have sued Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and the D.C. Council in order to stop the building of a homeless shelter in the area, alleging they were not consulted in the planning process.
The lawsuit encompasses the complaints of 21 citizens living around the McLean Gardens and Cathedral Heights neighborhoods. It claims the District did not give advanced notice of its plan to residents living around the proposed site and how it would impact nearby government facilities.
In addition, the suit, filed under the name “Neighbors for Responsive Government” in the D.C. Superior Court, alleges Ward 3’s Advisory Neighborhood Commission was not allowed to give input to the mayor’s office or D.C. Council regarding the design of the shelter located on Idaho Avenue NW, which is to house 50 apartment-style units.
The idea to open a new homeless shelter in Ward 3 is a result of Bowser’s decision in February to close the D.C. General Family Shelter, a building notorious for its unsanitary and dangerous conditions, and to open eight new, smaller ones throughout the city.
Ward 3’s shelter is marked to start construction in June 2017 along with the shelters in Wards 4, 5 and 6. In February of 2017, construction of shelters in Ward 7 and Ward 8 are scheduled to begin.
Bowser’s original plan to address homelessness, announced in February alongside the decision to close D.C. General, faced backlash from the D.C. Council due to high costs and the decision to lease private land for shelters rather than use cheaper public property.
The D.C. Council agreed to a new plan earlier this year after a long negotiation process with the mayor’s office and a public hearing under the condition that the new homeless shelters would be built on public land.
David Brown, the lawyer for the 21 residents who filed the lawsuit, said the lawsuit’s reasoning stems from the council’s decision to switch locations from private property to public land, which in the case of Ward 3 is the Second District Police Department.
“The citizens are basically trying to uphold their right by protesting the law to have input into the governmental decisions that have a significant effect on property owned by the government. They were denied that opportunity when the Council suddenly switched location from private property to a location on the Second District Police Station,” Brown said. “And all we are asking the court to do is to de-validate that choice until it is done properly.”
Bowser’s office and Ward 3 Councilmember Mary Cheh (D) declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing the District General Counsel’s policy, which is to refrain from commenting on ongoing litigation.
General Counsel Ellen Efros confirmed that the counsel is defending the D.C. Council and refused to comment further.
“I think all I can say at this point is that we will defend the lawsuit on behalf of the Council and we otherwise do not comment on pending litigation,” Efros wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Amanda Brouillard (NHS ’18), co-president of Georgetown’s Homeless Outreach Programs and Education, a student organization dedicated to addressing issues of hunger and homelessness in the District, the issue is complex because most residents agree with the decision to close D.C. General but not necessarily to build new shelters in their wards.
“It’s obviously a very controversial issue for some of the wards. I think the sentiment about closing D.C. General is pretty unanimous — most people agree that that shelter needs to close because conditions are very poor,” Brouillard said. “The issue is that a lot of people don’t want a new shelter in their own backyard, which is kind of an oversimplification.”
Brouillard also said that residents in Ward 3 could be concerned about the close proximity of the new shelter and various stereotypes of the homeless population.
“Some of the concerns are definitely legitimate. A lot of people are concerned about the cost, whether it’s cost-effective to build some of the shelters in the areas the mayor proposed. I think a lot of people are concerned about crime and people are also concerned about how people living and using the shelters will be able to adjust to the environment because some of them are affluent areas,” Brouillard said.
Brown conceded that some of the reasoning for the lawsuit can be attributed to the “not in my backyard” mindset of the plaintiffs. However, he contended that the residents have a right to provide input into the decisions of where to place the shelter.
“It is certainly true that they are concerned about having this in their backyard,” Brown said. “But in the dialogue process, those concerns will prove to be real or they will be answered.”
Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3C Chairman Carl Roller said he is not against the idea of a homeless shelter in Ward 3. Rather, his concerns stem from the fact that D.C. has been unresponsive and indifferent toward his and other residents’ ideas.
“I’m not against it, per se,” Roller said to The Washington Post on Aug. 24. “I just think we need those answers. Every time we ask a question, we get a nonanswer, which leads us to think they don’t have any answers.
D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) defended the city’s planning process for the homeless shelters, saying residents had more than three months to voice their concerns over the shelter’s locations during public hearings. Mendelson is confident the city will win in court.
“The process we followed is the process we follow with all legislation,” Mendelson said to The Washington Post. “In fact, the bill and discussion about the different sites was in the public domain for three and a half months. There were community meetings.”
According to Brown, the defendants have 60 days to answer the complaint from the date at which it was filed, Aug. 23.

Brahmachari Vrajvihari Sharan joined Georgetown this fall as the university’s first full-time director for Hindu life and the first Hindu priest-chaplain in the United States.
Sharan’s studies and ministry have taken him from his birthplace in the United Kingdom through South Asia and back, earning his master’s degree and completing his doctoral thesis at the University of Edinburgh with stints at the University of Delhi and Oxford University, before going on to teach at Cardiff University and the University of London. In an interview with The Hoya on Wednesday, Sharan discussed the importance of spirituality in his life and his new role at Georgetown.
It seems as though your career and your life have taken you all over the world in this whirlwind journey. Has your journey of faith matched up with that? Is there anything that being in a particular place or having different experiences does for you?
By a lot of good luck, I’ve been able to see a lot of the entire scope or the entire spectrum of human life on this planet, from the extremely needy to the other side. I love being with the needy people, because I think I am just as needy but in a different way.
It is refreshing always to see that even in the midst of their suffering or in their poverty or in their neediness, that they’re always so open-hearted, whereas the other end of the spectrum seems to be the reverse: They have everything, but they have a very cold, closed heart.
Do you see any specific need here that you are hoping to fill?
When I came here, the campus ministry were interested in providing a resource for the students, the Hindu students specifically, that was able to deepen their knowledge of their own religion and their own spirituality. Luckily for them, I suppose, I taught Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism as well as Hinduism. So the few Jain students that are here, the few here, I’ve enjoyed interacting with them as well.
It seems that deepening spirituality is one thing, but also interfaith relations, providing a presence for the South Asian religions or the Dharmic traditions as they’re called, finding a presence for the Dharmic traditions at the table of interfaith here, was desired for so long and has finally come about.
It is clear that this is a huge step for Georgetown toward that goal of having interreligious understanding, which is such a great part of our Jesuit tradition as well. Are there any specific plans that you have for that this semester?
There are a lot of interfaith opportunities as it stands built into the programming of Georgetown and I say that’s a testament. Some people, especially people in the U.K., have a very negative view of the Catholic Church. I think that when people are trying to change, it’s not helpful to keep bringing up negativities. It’s very important that if somebody’s making an effort to change, you support their change.
I have received quite a heavy criticism for joining a Catholic institution, but I believe that if people are trying to change, you should always try to help and support them in any way you can. That’s true selflessness. That’s true humanity.
The programs that are definitely more interfaith, I’m always going to be at them, and there are a few interfaith things that I’m already planning regarding basically talking. Dialogue is how interfaith works, but dialogue that’s held in an open arena so that people can see that we are getting along very well.
Each of the different faith traditions actually gets along very well and when you come to Georgetown. You can see that all the faith traditions are operating in the same space — under the Catholic umbrella, but we’re all faithful to our own traditions. It’s a good example for everybody else outside who does not see religion working together well. This is how it’s supposed to work and we want this example to be out there as much as possible.
Would you say that the interfaith aspect is one of your favorite things about coming to Georgetown?
I do. I’ve done a lot of interfaith work in the U.K. and the interfaith work also gives me a particularly vested interest being a Dharmic tradition adherent. Dharmic traditions have not received a positive representation. Part of that is our own fault. There are unhelpful political situations that are taking place in South Asia at the moment, which does not help, but then there are a lot of good things that unfortunately have not been recognized due to whatever sort of climate, politically, or however it has been throughout the years. I believe, as change is the order of the day, we can do something about it.
What is your favorite thing about coming to Georgetown that is not rel
ated to school and work?
What I find about Georgetown that is particularly alluring is its ability to be this big, old faith center, an institution built on faith that still has people coming to it who are not aligned with any particular faith. To see how they are engaging with a religious institution in the way that they do, it gives me a lot of hope because there are other places in the world where if you profess any sort of faith, you’re viewed as if you come from some ancient dimension and you’re obsolete and you’re basically a fool for believing in anything else other than what is accepted as rational.
To see that there is this engagement, it really is a very heartening thing because for the Dharmic traditions, we kind of pride ourselves on our ability to remain very scientific, which is why we still have a lot of people who are science-based following our practices even if they don’t subscribe to the whole theology of it. They do still adhere to the practices because they make a difference.

When El Salvador was facing violence and economic turmoil in the late 1990s following a bloody civil war, a 9-year-old Luis Rosales (MSB ’18) was brought to the United States by his parents.
“There was a lot of violence and economic turmoil. A lot of the times, they read cases where young kids were recruited to gangs. They didn’t like what was happening there, so to seek a better life and chase the American dream, they came to the U.S.,” Rosales said.
This Wednesday marked Rosales’ first day of classes at Georgetown, which he attends on a full-ride scholarship from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation. An immigrant who was brought to the United States illegally, Rosales transferred to Georgetown from Montgomery College in Maryland.
The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation provides 75 financially struggling community college students with scholarships worth up to $45,000 annually to transfer to four-year universities. The foundation received more than 2,300 applications before making a final decision.
In addition to providing scholarships to transfer students, the foundation also provides scholarships to middle school students, high school seniors and graduate students.
According to Rosales, his family had a difficult time building a better life in the United States due to the family’s lack of a legal immigration status.
“Being undocumented immigrants, they couldn’t really work, so for a little while my family struggled economically. I didn’t think I could go to school at all. I didn’t think I could afford it or go through it,” Rosales said.
In 2012, President Barack Obama passed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which shields young people who were brought to the United States at a young age from deportation and gives them the ability to work and go to school legally.
Thanks to DACA, Rosales was able to obtain a full-tuition scholarship to Montgomery College, where he attended the honors business school and received his associate degree.
Despite the obstacles he faced, Rosales has a long list of notable personal and academic achievements. Upon entering Montgomery, he was very involved with student government and the honors business program, and he established a chapter at the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization dedicated to advancing the Hispanic population in the country.
During his sophomore year in 2015, he was appointed by Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) to Montgomery College’s board of trustees as the student representative, where he represented over 60,000 students.
“At the end of my sophomore year, I applied for Jack Kent Cooke after having done all of these things,” Rosales said. “It’s very competitive, so I cried when I got it. Getting into Georgetown was one thing, but paying for it was another, so it made my dreams a reality.”
Cooke Foundation Executive Director Harold O. Levy said the scholarship provides opportunities for students of very high caliber, like Rosales, who otherwise would not be able to attend four-year colleges.
“The Cooke Foundation’s undergraduate transfer scholars have a long record of success at the most selective colleges and graduate schools, such as the Ivy League in the United States and the University of Oxford in Great Britain,” Levy said in a statement. “These extraordinary young people have proven repeatedly and conclusively that top community college students have the ability to thrive in top four-year colleges. They deserve equal educational opportunity.”
In recent years, the Georgetown community has made a growing effort to welcome students who lack legal immigration status to the university. In December of 2010, University President John J. DeGioia spoke out and expressed his strong support of the DREAM Act on WAMU, an NPR-affiliated radio station.
“At Georgetown, students who meet the DREAM Act criteria are campus leaders and role models for their generation. They are pursuing challenging majors, are actively engaged in campus organization and regularly participate in community service,” DeGioia said.
More recently, Georgetown launched a website in April officially institutionalizing support for these students and the resources available on campus.
In a letter sent in August to incoming freshmen and transfer students, UndocuHoyas, a campus organization dedicated to serving undocumented students since 2010, expressed its support for these students.
“Getting to college is difficult, but not as difficult as it is for undocumented students. Whatever hardships you have had to endure, you made it this far now. You should be proud of your accomplishments and strength. Your perseverance is admirable and an incredible addition to the Georgetown community,” the letter reads.
Rosales’ roommate James Linn (MSB ’18) said he is inspired by his story.
“Moving into my sophomore year, I was inspired by Luis’ attitude and I learned of his background and story. Being the humble guy he was, I had not previously known that he had overcome a great deal of adversity to be able to attend Montgomery College,” Linn said. “Despite that, he made a point to encourage and support me as a friend. Now at Georgetown, I couldn’t have asked for a better roommate. I’m excited to be entering this chapter of my life knowing I’ll have a friend to encourage, support and inspire me along the way.”
For Rosales, coming to Georgetown is more than just a personal achievement — it is also a responsibility.
“To me, [coming to Georgetown] means that not only can you achieve the things that you work hard for, but also that I — and all other undocumented students who have gotten the chance to attend a four-year university — have a responsibility to voice the issues of those who weren’t as fortunate as we were and speak for them because there are many other students who work hard but didn’t get these opportunities and would have loved to,” Rosales said. “So, it gives me a sense of responsibility to use my education to help others.”

The Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service announced Monday the addition of seven new members and an expansion from 15 to 18 members to its advisory board, a team made up of professional political and policy experts who plan out the organization’s direction and provide support for current projects.
New members of the advisory board include a former aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, Mary Cheney, who also served as managing partner of the public policy firm New Troy Strategies; former White House Deputy Director of Political Affairs and Special Assistant to President Obama Patrick Dillon (COL ’99); Funny or Die D.C. Managing Director and Executive Producer Brad Jenkins; CNN Senior Political Correspondent Brianna Keilar; Co-Founder and Former Chief Operating Officer of Politico Kim Kingsley; Americas Tax Policy Leader at professional services firm Ernst & Young Cathy Koch (GRD ’94); Airbnb’s Head of Global Communications and Strategic Engagement Kim Rubey (COL ’96) and Clark Hill PLC Chair Charlie Spies (LAW ’98).
GU Politics, founded last year as a part of the McCourt School of Public Policy, serves as a political hub for Georgetown, regularly hosting speakers and other policy-based programs.
Executive Director of GU Politics Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) said the advisory board members were chosen based on their dedication to connecting students to politics through a lens of community service.
“We’re always looking for top names in politics, government and media that share our commitment to engaging young people about improving our political system and encouraging them to see politics as a noble vehicle for public service,” Elleithee wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Elleithee said extra seats were added to the board in order keep up with the fast pace that GU Politics set in its first year and to help support a growing agenda throughout the upcoming academic year.
“Like last year’s board, this dynamic and diverse set of professionals will continue to help us shape our programming and the future of GU Politics,” Elleithee wrote. “We expanded our Advisory Board from 15 to 18 members in hopes of doing more and better programming for all Georgetown students. We are grateful to each of them for their service.”
In addition, Elleithee said GU Politics ensured members were added in the spirit of bipartisanship in order to reflect the varying political identities of Georgetown students as a whole.
“Not all Hoyas are cut from the same political cloth. We wanted to bring on advisers of all political stripes – Democrats, Republicans and those who lean more independent or neutral, like journalists,” Elleithee wrote. “Their unique political positions, experiences, and networks will help us form programming that aligns with the interests of as many Georgetown students as possible.”
Dillon, one of the new members of the board, worked as a GU Politics Spring 2016 fellow last semester. Dillon said he is excited by what lies ahead for him as an advisory board member.
“I’m excited to be a part of it,” Dillon said. “It’s really been a great experience. In fact, one of the real highlights of my current career was to be in the Institute as a fellow last semester, and so now to get a chance to continue working with a great team at the Institute and the really amazing students is a really special opportunity and something that I feel honored by but also energized by.”
Connor Maytnier (COL ’17), who served as a convention ambassador for GU Politics at the Republican National Convention in July, said he is eager to work with the organization’s new additions and the diverse group of policy experts.
“The announcement of the new advisory board members has been very exciting.” Maytnier said. “The composition of the advisory board shows that politics and public service come in many forms and that there are many roads for us as students to explore.”

Students concerned with the university’s 4 percent tuition increase this year have rallied around a social media campaign to raise awareness about the costs of yearly hikes and to pressure the administration to increase transparency about expenses.
The Facebook page “Hoyas Against the Hike,” has accumulated over 170 likes since it launched in late August and bills itself as a movement “to foster open student dialogue about the recent tuition hike.”
Hoyas Against the Hike Leader Joe Picozzi (COL ’17) said the group’s primary goal is to pressure university President John J. DeGioia to host a town hall to explain the rationale behind the projected increases in tuition.
“We want to give DeGioia an opportunity to explain the hike and explain where this money is going to, because there are resources on campus that do need more funding and I understand the financial pressures we are faced with given the size of our endowment,” Picozzi said. “Our first step is going to be to ask the university to be open and to bring DeGioia to speak to students.”
Picozzi partnered with the Georgetown University Student Association and other student groups to demonstrate to university administrators that students from various backgrounds share concern for tuition increases. GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and GUSA Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) wrote a viewpoint in The Hoya on Tuesday (“To the President’s Office of Georgetown,” The Hoya, Aug. 30, 2016, A3) asking for DeGioia to participate in a town hall with students addressing the hike.
“I think what is amazing is that we have students from all different sides from campus politics,” Picozzi said. “This hike really does affect a lot of students in the middle group who are well-off enough that they don’t qualify for programs like [Georgetown Scholarship Program] but aren’t wealthy enough to pay for it.”
The university announced the 4 percent tuition increase in February as a part of the financial plan for fiscal years 2017-2020. The financial plan lays out the university’s projected financial growth and estimates sources of income and anticipated expenditures, as well as predicting any future tuition increases.
Tuition rose at a slower rate than last year’s 4.3 percent hike, and is anticipated to grow at a steady 4 percent for the next four years.
Picozzi said the hike demonstrates a nationwide trend and believes Georgetown should take a stand against future tuition rate increases.
“We want to change the process to help curb the tide of rising tuition costs nationwide. The university says that Harvard increased the tuition by 3 percent. This is a national trend,” Picozzi said. “My view is that Georgetown is a leader nationwide. It prides itself in producing leaders. And I believe that this is an opportunity for Georgetown to show some leadership in pushing back the tide of rising costs.”
In a joint statement to The Hoya, Khan and Fisk said the biggest issue with the latest increase is the lack of transparency in how funds are disbursed.
“The announcement was made in February immediately after the winter board of directors meeting. However, most students were not made aware of the increase until they received their tuition bills this summer,” the statement reads. “Students saw this increase as coming out of left field. Transparency is clearly an issue here.”
Khan and Fisk said the university owes students an explanation of where funds are going.
“Aside from the stress this puts on middle class students, transparency is the problem that needs to be addressed immediately, and the university needs to speak for itself on the matter. We recognize the strain the 4 percent increase in cost of attendance puts on students who pay full freight. Ultimately, there is great ambiguity about the allocation and purposes of the increase — where exactly is this money going?” the statement reads.
Khan and Fisk said that even though part of the tuition hike will fund the university’s 8 percent increase in financial aid funding — the largest investment in financial aid resources in the school’s history — the university must clarify the nuances of the financial plan.
“The 8 percent expansion of financial aid resources is definitely something to be proud of, but generally, funding and allocation of resources is clearly a nuanced process at Georgetown, and something the university needs to include students in and clarify,” the statement reads.
Christopher Grocki (MSB ’17) said he understands why the university might need to increase funds, but thinks the university should examine whether it is spending money efficiently.
“It’s a classic example of bait and switch. If they were selling you a car and this happened, it would be illegal,” Grocki said. “The reality is that there is nothing wrong with increasing tuition, but if you looked around, you would find a lot of money being spent at this university that is not necessarily spent in such a prudent way, while there are other things that are being neglected.”
Nick Scrimenti (COL ’18) said the university must recognize the significant real-world harms tuition increases cause.
“I talked to one student whose family literally sold their apartment and moved to a smaller home to pay for college tuition. I know people taking out home equity loans, selling precious assets and taking out second mortgages to help pay for college tuition,” Scrimenti said. “When you think about the struggles some people have to go through to get an education, it defeats the purpose and spirit of a Georgetown education.”
Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh was not available to provide comment on Hoyas Against the Hike as of press time.
Correction: This article previously stated the GUSA statement was from Khan only; Khan and Fisk co-authored the statement.

Students returned to uncleaned apartments, water leaks, mold and broken furniture during the early move-in period last week, which left some students in temporary housing as they waited for their accommodations to be prepared.
Beginning with students who moved in early for pre-orientation programs, New Student Orientation advisor training and other activities, the Office of Residential Living received reports from multiple residence halls. The office dispatched personnel from its department, and from the Office of Planning and Facilities Management to address students’ problems as quickly as possible.
Common problems included air conditioner leaks and unclean rooms. According to Executive Director for Residential Services Patrick Killilee, more students had issues with rooms not yet being cleaned this year than in past years. A similar number of students reported facilities issues this year compared to past years.
Upon entering their Henle Village apartment, Marco Garcia (SFS ’19) and his roommates immediately found signs of black mold. Garcia and his roommates were placed in temporary housing — first, in Darnall Hall prior to the start of New Student Orientation, and then in Village C East.
“The Henle was in a bad condition [upon arrival]. For how much we pay you’d think housing would at least be presentable upon move in,” Garcia said. “The university looked at the apartment and eventually deemed it safe, and they cleaned it very thoroughly.”
The Office of Residential Living responded promptly to their report of black mold, sending in a certified applied microbial remediation Technician to inspect the apartment and treat the mold within a few days. After a week of measures taken by the Office of Planning and Facilities Management to eliminate the mold and the associated safety hazards, Garcia and his roommates were told they could move into their apartment.
Katie Schmidt’s (SFS ’18)kitchen in her Village A apartment was entirely gutted once Schmidt and her parents realized that a massive water leak and black mold had overtaken the area during the summer.
“I received early move in to help with new student move in and it soon became apparent that the kitchen had severe water damage and black mold. It was unusable,” Schmidt said.
This proved especially problematic as Schmidt did not sign up for a meal plan this semester.
“Georgetown treated the apartment like it was ready to move in when in reality the kitchen needed a week of renovation,” Schmidt said.
Killilee acknowledged the problems returning students experienced on their respective move-in days.
“We did have students impacted by facilities that were not cleaned or ready for move-in, especially during our August Transition period,” Killilee wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In most cases, rooms and apartments were cleaned immediately, but would delay move-in for an hour or so. In a handful of instances some students were given temporary housing while more extensive work was completed.”
Killilee said the Office of Residential Living and the Office of Planning and Facilities Management is looking at ways to reduce the increased reports of unclean rooms during student move in.
“We have seen more apartment cleaning issues that we typically do.  Residential Living and Facilities will be looking at how we improve the cleaning, maintenance and inspections process in the future.  The August Transition program will also need to be reviewed to allow for more time in units before academic year occupancy can begin,” Killilee wrote. “While [we] will not be able to prevent all facilities issue that could arise, no student should move-in to a room that has not been cleaned.”
Killilee explained the difficulties both offices face in working together to ensure that all housing is ready for students arriving early to campus.
“Ideally, no student would move into a room that was not ready for them. The Office of Residential Living and Facilities Management work closely on preparation of rooms and apartments for fall move-in,” Killilee wrote.
Killilee said the Office of Residential Living and the Office of Planning and Facilities Management are pressed for time during the summer to maintain clean residences, and are challenged by older buildings that require more maintenance.
“There is a very compressed calendar from the end of summer school and summer conferences to when students start returning for the academic year. We have over 1,900 students arrive prior to the official move-in weekend,” Killilee wrote. “In some cases there is less than a week to clean a room and make repairs. Second, we have aging facilities which need more time to clean and repair, than new facilities.”
Although the housing issues came as a surprise to students upon move in, many students expressed their appreciation toward both the Office of Residential Living and the Office of Planning and Facilities Management for their work in making the necessary repairs in a timely and satisfactory manner.
“It’s important to mention that after the issue with my kitchen was identified, facilities did a great job to get the renovation moving,” Schmidt said. “I really appreciate all of the work that residential living and facilities are currently doing on our apartment.”

Metropolitan Police Department Assistant Chief Peter Newsham will begin his term as interim chief of the MPD on Sept. 17 following the retirement of Chief Cathy Lanier, as announced by Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) on Aug. 23.
This announcement comes one week after Lanier declared she would step down after 10 years as chief of Washington D.C.’s police force in order to serve as the new senior vice president of security operations at the National Football League. Lanier marked the first permanent female chief.
Bowser highlighted Newsham’s 14 years of experience as the MPD’s assistant chief and his decades-long commitment to serving the District as qualifications for his new role.
“Like Chief Lanier, Peter has deep roots serving the District and believes in the power of building relationships with communities as the best way to deter and solve crime,” Bowser said in a statement. “I have known him for more than a decade; he is a police officer of the highest caliber and is extremely qualified to serve as the interim chief of police while we conduct the search for a permanent replacement.”
MPD Public Affairs Specialist Alice Kim added that Lanier and Newsham have shared experiences and visions for the department.
“Chief Newsham and Chief Lanier have worked together for many years and Chief Lanier has welcomed the news of Chief Newsham’s appointment,” Kim wrote in an email to The Hoya. “With the transition as Chief Lanier retires and Chief Newsham takes command as interim chief, his plans and priorities are to build upon MPD’s successes.”
Lanier’s retirement comes a year after the D.C. Police Union released the results of a survey which found 98 percent of the 1,150 MPD officers who participated in the survey indicated they had “no confidence” in Lanier’s ability to lead the department. Lanier frequently clashed with the police union, which questioned her management style and the speed at which she hired new staff.
Though crime rates have decreased substantially during Lanier’s tenure, the number of homicides in D.C. increased by 54 percent from 2014 to 2015. Similarly, though the number of homicides at this point in 2016 is 14 percent lower than it was in 2015, the District is on track to have a homicide rate approximately 20 percent higher than it did in 2014.
Kim asserted that Lanier’s resignation was unrelated to the majority vote of “no confidence,” saying relations between the Police Union and MPD have improved in the past year.
“Chief Lanier and management at MPD have seen improved relations with the Police Union since the change in leadership, and have worked together closely to resolve issues that have come up in the past,” Kim wrote.
Newsham, who graduated from the College of the Holy Cross with a degree in political science, joined the police force in 1989 after initially seeking work on Capitol Hill.
After being named the assistant chief of police in 2002, Mr. Newsham has overseen various offices in the police department, including the Office of Professional Responsibility and the Investigative Services Bureau.
“Like all good political science majors, I came down to D.C. looking for a job on Capitol Hill,” said Newsham in an interview with NBC Washington. “I was living on my own at the time and the salaries on the Hill weren’t really enough to support myself. So I saw that the police department was advertising for police officers in the paper, and I took that opportunity. And I got to tell you, truly and honestly, that was the best decision I ever made in my life.”
Kim said Newsham’s plans for the department are focused on community relations and the individuals on the force.
“Going forth, Chief Newsham believes that 1. the cornerstone of a successful police department is in the relationship that it has with the community it serves, and 2. those successes aren’t possible without a productive, happy, healthy members in the force,” Kim wrote. “He strongly believes that the assets MPD has are the people who carry forth the job and responsibilities.”
The mayor’s office will continue to search for candidates for MPD chief both in and outside the District with the hopes of selecting the next chief of police from D.C.’s law enforcement elite. Though the mayor may nominate whoever she chooses for the role of MPD Chief, her choice must ultimately be approved by the D.C. Council.
In her resignation letter, Lanier said she believes she is leaving the MPD in capable hands.
“After 26 years with MPD I have decided to submit my papers for retirement,” Lanier wrote in a resignation letter. “I came to this difficult decision with mixed emotions, but in the end, I am confident that MPD has the most exceptional police officers and leadership that will continue to move this agency and the city forward.”

Interim Dean of the School of Nursing and Health Studies Patricia Cloonan was appointed as the school’s dean for a three-year term.
Executive Dean of the School of Medicine Dr. Edward Healton announced in an email to the Georgetown University Medical Center on May 19.
In the email, Healton said Cloonan has been a distinguished and vital member of the Georgetown community for over 20 years.
“Pat has provided exceptional leadership as the school enhanced current academic programs and launched new ones,” Healton wrote.
During her two-year tenure as interim dean, Cloonan led the development of the school’s strategic plan, which outlines its areas of focus for the coming years.
Following Healton’s email, Cloonan announced her new position as official dean in the school’s summer e-newsletter sent out to NHS students, faculty and alumni June 14. According to Cloonan, her appointment by University President John J. DeGioia was not announced in an email to the entire university because she was not a new addition to the Georgetown community.
“The nature of my appointment is a little different,” Cloonan said. “Since I had already been an interim dean, we made the decision that I would announce to the Medical Center because that’s organizationally where NHS lives. My colleagues on the main campus were all made aware as well.”
Going forward, Cloonan said the NHS is focusing on health equity in the Washington, D.C. area.
“We’re very focused on the D.C. community,” Cloonan said. “Our capacity to look at it from the pre-med, health administration, human science and global sides puts us in a unique place to develop programming with the community around this issue of improved health.”
According to Cloonan, the NHS is building upon its past efforts to draw greater attention to the issues facing those living in the broader D.C. community.
“In terms of our upcoming year, we really want to capitalize on the work we’ve done in a particular way,” Cloonan said. “The President’s Office asked our office to conduct a report assessing the health disparities of the District of Columbia. We’re organizing a variety of our internal activities, guest speakers, etc. around health equity.”
Cloonan said the strategic plan will also focus on experiential learning, including undergraduate research, studying abroad and community engagement. In particular, Cloonan highlighted the Discovery Center, a teaching and research laboratory established at the NHS in 2006.
“We want to continue to work to develop our experiential learning capacity,” Cloonan said. “Another addition we will focus on is strengthening our Discovery Center. We’ve worked on that over the past year, and I intend to continue to do that.”
Cloonan said she is optimistic about the future of her tenure in terms of what the NHS will achieve.
“We really anticipate a great couple of years,” Cloonan said. “We have lots of energy and a real focus with respect to the strategic plan that all the faculty and staff worked on together.”
Andrea Dressel (NHS ’19) expressed excitement about Cloonan’s continued leadership, highlighting the former interim dean’s efforts to connect with students on an individual level.
“She’s a great dean. It helps that the NHS is kind of a smaller school, so she is able to get to know all the students more personally,” Dressel said. “I remember the first time I talked to her was during NSO. I didn’t know at first she was the dean. When she spoke later at an event, I was surprised because she had been very interested in how move in went and made sure I felt welcome and comfortable.”

Following persistent elevator outages, the Washington Monument, which has been closed since Aug. 17, is to remain closed until mid-September, before a more complete repair plan will shutter the 555-foot obelisk for nine months.
The repairs, estimated to cost between $2 million to $3 million, aim to tackle a spate of problems including a broken cable below the elevator, which spurred the National Park Service’s decision to close the monument on August 17.
National Mall and Memorial Parks Superintendent Gay Vietzke said the elevator was last modernized in the 1990s and is now pushing the limits of the device’s 20-year lifespan.
“We are finding ourselves at the end of the life of this system,” Vietzke said in a news conference August 24. “We know we have to modernize the system.”
The repair was initially slated for 10 days but extended for weeks longer after the repairs proved more time-consuming than initially estimated. The National Park Service did not say when the nine-month closure would begin.
Many of the issues stem from unresolved damage from a 2011 earthquake, which closed the monument to the public for three years.
The NPS has encountered a vocal critic in Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), who expressed her frustration about the persistent closures, which she said would prove detrimental to the local economy during a vital tourism season.
Norton chastised the NPS for not taking more decisive steps in fixing the elevator following the 2011 earthquake.
“I believe NPS erred in not rehabilitating the elevator when the monument was closed for renovations following the 2011 earthquake,” Norton said in a statement. “When an elevator seems to be in good shape, but is a one-of-a-kind elevator that operates 13 hours per day from Memorial Day to Labor Day, and eight hours per day thereafter, the elevator’s lifespan must be uniquely measured.”
Norton met with NPS officials Aug. 29 for a briefing to discuss the repairs. Vietzke said the meeting clarified the importance of modernizing the structure.
“We very much appreciate the congresswoman’s support and interest in the Washington Monument,” Vietzke said. “We share her frustration in its continued closure and are working diligently to determine the causes for the recent problems and to develop a long-term solution to modernize the elevator.”
