Georgetown University started providing students living on campus with weekly grocery allowances after students raised concerns about food insecurity over winter break.
Throughout this semester, the university offered dining options at Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall as well as at on-campus dining locations Epicurean and Company and Royal Jacket Deli for the approximately 500 students living on campus. 
Meal plans at Georgetown typically include a number of prepaid meal swipes that give students access to select food stations. Students can also pay for meals with debit dollars or Flex dollars, which can be used at any of Georgetown’s dining services, known as Hoya Hospitality locations. Students can deposit debit dollars onto their GOCard account and use those funds to make purchases on and off campus.
While each of the three locations open during the fall semester accommodates student payment from meal plans, Epi and Royal Jacket only accept Flex dollars and debit dollars. However, Leo’s, the only dining hall on campus and the only option that does not require Flex or debit dollars, closed Nov. 22 and will not reopen until the start of the spring semester Jan. 25. 
After Leo’s closed, students raised concerns about food insecurity because their meal swipes could not be accepted. Georgetown’s Office of Residential Living announced a plan to provide meal options for on-campus students starting Nov. 23, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Funds will be split between flex dollars and debit dollars, with students receiving $105 in flex dollars and $70 in debit dollars each week,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Students will automatically receive funds deposited directly in their GOCard accounts for each week they tell the university they are on campus during the break. Students do not need to opt in to the program, according to the email.
Before the university’s announcement, students were unsure if the university would financially assist students, according to Sydney Gilbert (SFS ’23), co-chair of the Georgetown University Student Association Socioeconomic Policy Team.
“We weren’t sure administration would be the best place to go to because they had not really responded well to similar requests in the past,” Gilbert said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
Student organizations like Students Advancing Food Equity, a group that raises awareness about food insecurity at Georgetown, and Swipe Out Hunger, which has previously run a food swipe donation program for students to donate unused meal swipes, have supported students on campus already this semester. 
The additional Flex dollars can be used at Royal Jacket and through the Hoyas @ Home grocery delivery service, a program that allows students to order food and other supplies directly to the doors of their dorms. The debit dollars that will be loaded directly onto students’ GOCard accounts can be used at participating businesses in and around the Georgetown neighborhood, including &pizza, Chipotle and CVS Pharmacy.
While the plan does not offer much variety, it will accommodate students living on campus, according to on-campus student Esther Wroth (SFS ’24), a member of SAFE who is living on campus.
“I think the plan is sufficient,” Wroth said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It has a lot less selection, and it is on the opposite side of campus from where most people live, and people are complaining. But aside from the convenience and selection, it is enough.”
Despite Georgetown’s plan, some students felt the announcement was too late and only offered a temporary resolution to an ongoing problem, according to Gilbert.
“My bigger concern, though, is just making sure this doesn’t all happen again in the spring with spring break, and kind of really addressing the underlying problem rather than just coming up with the last-minute fix, like, three days after the dining halls closed,” Gilbert said.
Georgetown Mutual Aid Network, a student group established this year to help distribute funds to students in need, has also been raising money via social media for on-campus students struggling with food insecurity.
Even with the university’s financial support, students are still struggling to find meals, according to Binqi Chen (NHS ’22), an organizer for Georgetown Mutual Aid. (Full disclosure: Chen formerly served as a design assistant for The Hoya). 
“It is amazing they have recognized where they have fallen behind,” Chen said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We are also here to recognize that the $175 is inconvenient for students — we’re here to supply the rest of what they need to fill their dietary needs.”
Chen hopes this year’s conversations will provide a framework from which Georgetown can continue taking steps to address general food insecurity on campus, she said.
“There has been a learning curve,” Chen said. “But the university is also hearing its students, and that’s great.”
Despite concerns, student leaders advocating for on-campus residents hope the program will continue past this winter, according to Gilbert.
“I’m very glad the administration did come up with this program. And I do want to emphasize it is very good and very necessary, that they did the right thing,” Gilbert said. “I just hope that it continues. They continue to take into account the student concerns and the real experiences of some of the most vulnerable members of the community.”

Many Georgetown University first-year students spent the extended Thanksgiving break visiting the Washington, D.C. area and exploring Georgetown University’s campus despite a recent spike in D.C. COVID-19 cases. 
As a result of a modified academic calendar, Georgetown scheduled an extended Thanksgiving break from Nov. 21 to Nov. 29. In past semesters, students only received two days of break. According to the university, the changes were made to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by limiting travel to and from campus.
However, the modified academic calendar gave off-campus first-years an opportunity to travel to the D.C. area and visit Georgetown’s campus. 
Henry Chen (COL ’24), who had not visited the Georgetown campus since touring two years ago, met a group of six fellow students in D.C. over the break. Two of the students in the group were living on campus.
“I really felt like I was part of the Georgetown community when I was there,” Chen said in an interview with the Hoya. “For most of the semester, I still felt like a high school kid, with my high school friends, doing the same old stuff, just taking Georgetown classes. But actually going there with other college kids and seeing the place and being together really creates a sense of community that online can’t do.”
While Chen and his friends took precautions, Chen did not feel the COVID-19 pandemic had a large impact on their trip. 
“On the train, you had to wear a mask and everyone was kind of separated,” Chen said. “When we walked around the city, we had the masks on and everything. When it was between the kids, we just kind of sat in a room and talked and stuff. Obviously there were precautions to take and it was concerning, but I think most of us kind of needed to travel and meet up in person because of Zoom fatigue and all that.”
Before the break, university officials sent a letter to on-campus students advising them on health and safety measures to take if considering travel. However, the letter did not mention anything about interacting with visitors. 
Over Thanksgiving break, 26 people on or near campus tested positive for COVID-19, according to university records.
Despite an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases within the university community, Georgetown’s on-campus restrictions only limit students from inviting visitors into their dorms, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Residents of University-owned housing are permitted to host in their assigned spaces only those students who are approved to live on campus, in groups of 10 or fewer, including the host(s),” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Although D.C. requires travelers coming from jurisdictions with more than 10 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people to get a negative test result at least 72 hours before visiting the area, Chen said he was not aware of that restriction and did not check COVID-19 travel restrictions before his trip.
Kathy Gong (COL ’24), who also visited D.C. with three of her friends, noted that D.C. did not enforce COVID-19 restrictions. (Full disclosure: Gong is a staffer in The Hoya’s Financial Operations Department.)
“We weren’t affected by any travel restrictions – D.C. does require a negative test within 72 hours of traveling (which we had) but we were never asked to show the results,” Gong wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Gong and her friends took several precautions, including getting tested before and after the trip, quarantining once they returned home and practicing social distancing and wearing masks during the trip, she wrote.
While the extended break was put in place to minimize travel, it did not affect Gong’s plans, she said.
“There’s a good possibility we still would’ve gone if Thanksgiving break was only Thursday/Friday; a few of us had classes on Friday and just went on Zoom in the hotel, so we probably could’ve done that for Monday as well if needed or shortened the trip to three days instead,” Gong said. 
Even before break, there was a steady stream of visitors on campus throughout the semester, including both D.C. locals and Georgetown students from outside of the D.C. area, according to Alyssa Hirai (SFS ’24), who lives on campus.
“I would say every day I would see visitors on campus,” Hirai said in an interview with The Hoya. “There would be old people just walking every day, or people running through campus daily. Throughout the semester, I would see people flying in or visiting from outside of D.C.” 
Despite the visitors, the frequency of COVID-19 tests required for on-campus students has made her feel safer living on campus, Hirai said.
“We have to test every week, so even if you were to meet people from off campus, since you get tested regularly and there is an app where you have to report your daily COVID symptoms, that helps with containing any type of possible spread.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) joined a panel of politicians, artists, faculty and students reflecting on the legacy of celebrated Georgetown University professor Jan Karski in a Dec. 3 event that previewed an upcoming film about Karski’s life.
The online event, titled “Bearing Witness: The Legacy of Jan Karski Today,” brought together several acclaimed academics to shine light on the life and legacy of Karski, a Polish World War II war hero, spy and diplomat. Karski’s eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust were among the first delivered to Western allies. Karski served in the government department at Georgetown for over 40 years. 
Pelosi lauded Karski’s courage in telling the truth about the atrocities of the Holocaust, even when many questioned him. “The United States must exhibit the same courage in standing up for human rights in our world today,” Pelosi said during the livestreamed event.
“One thing that really strikes me is the comparable phenomenon of denial and disbelief and mistrust that he encountered and that we are encountering every day,” Pelosi said. “We must speak out against these problems even if against our economic interests, otherwise the U.S. loses moral authority in these places.”
The event featured several other notable panelists, including Oscar-nominated actor David Strathairn, who stars in the play “Remember This: The Lesson of Jan Karski.” The conversation was moderated by theater professor Derek Goldman, who directed and co-authored the play.
Strathairn said he has often reflected on the lessons he has taken from Karski’s experiences while acting in character as Karski.
“I think about Karski’s choice to speak because he had a ‘historical responsibility;’ in this, we can find a lesson for the next generation. ‘If you choose to be a citizen of a certain country and you choose your leaders, you have a responsibility to speak up,’” Strathairn said, quoting Karski.
The play was produced by Georgetown’s Laboratory For Global Performance and Politics, an interdisciplinary program that integrates international relations with the performing arts. Goldman and Cynthia Schneider, The Lab’s co-founders, commented on how Karski’s story fits within the broader context of The Lab’s mission. 
Colleen Bell, a former ambassador to Hungary and director of the California Film Commission, said The Lab plays an important role in bringing untold stories such as Karski’s to the focus of mainstream media. 
“The power of performance can help to shape communal narratives that serve to humanize all of us,” Bell said. “The ability of artistic expression to evoke emotion, to touch the minds and the hearts of an audience, is extremely valuable.”
The event also featured four undergraduate Georgetown students who enrolled in the one-credit course  “Bearing Witness,” which is part of the “Just Communities” curriculum that focuses on racial injustice, this semester. 
Students said the class deepened their understanding of Karski’s lifework and provoked questions relating to the culture of exclusion and division that has defined 2020 current affairs.
The event concluded with a live performance by Strathairn, who acted out an excerpt from the play, as well as an excerpt from the upcoming film “Remember This,” inspired by the play. In his closing remarks before previewing the play and film, Strathairn said he hoped these artistic renditions of Karski’s story would help introduce new generations to Karski’s legacy.
“Everything we have heard is testament that we have done something. If this piece can elicit this articulate response, I am overwhelmed by the students,” Strathairn said. “They can create and impact a space whereby people like us can articulate the viscera for so many people. That is extraordinary.”

Kudos to everyone involved in this work and production — and thank you speaker Pelosi — to bring greater attention to the remarkable legacy of Jan Karski.

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority released a budget proposal that would make drastic cuts to public transportation in Washington, D.C., affecting several bus routes servicing the Georgetown neighborhood. 
The proposal would also eliminate all weekend Metrorail service, stop weekday service at 9 p.m. and lengthen wait times between rides. These cuts come as the Metro faces a funding gap of almost $500 million dollars, with ridership hovering around just 20 to 25% of pre-pandemic rates as more people work from home and avoid public transportation out of fear of exposure to the coronavirus. 
Under this new plan, Route D1 (Glover Park-Franklin Square Line) and Route G2 (P Street-LeDroit Park Line) would be fully eliminated. Route D2 (Glover Park-Dupont Circle Line) would be eliminated and partially replaced by service on the Massachusetts Avenue line. 
These potential cuts highlight the pressing need for federal aid, according to Mayor Muriel Bowser (D). 
“Not too long ago with our partners in the region and our federal government, we put Metro on the right track to meet the needs of residents and visitors alike,” Bowser said in a statement to WUSA9 on Nov. 30. “Regardless of party or ideology, we must once again come together to save Metro.”
Bowser’s call for increased federal funding comes after WMATA received $876 million in federal funding through a coronavirus aid package in May. In July, American Public Transportation Association President and CEO Paul Skoutelas stated that a relief package including at least $32 billion dedicated to supporting public transit would be crucial to the survival of the industry.
The Georgetown community will be hit hard by these service line cuts, according to Alex Taliadoros, organizing director of Georgetown University’s Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor. 
“We are losing nearly all of the Metrobus lines near campus and will also be hurt by the reduced hours and loss of weekend service for Metrorail,” Taliadoros wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown already suffered from not having a nearby Metro station, and this will sever our ties to public transit.”
Taliadoros opposed planned service changes in February when WMATA announced plans to merge bus routes G2 and D2 and move the bus stop at the front gates of Georgetown’s campus six blocks away. After receiving pushback from university officials and local residents, WMATA reversed its decision and preserved the G2 bus route. 
University administrators are paying close attention to the situation, according to Heidi Tseu, director of local government affairs in Georgetown’s Office of Community Engagement.
“We are tracking this issue closely and will monitor how these proposed changes might impact the university and our community,” Tseu wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Ensuring access to reliable public transportation is important to a wide range of people in our university community, and we will continue to work with the city and our community partners as this develops.”
The university should continue work with WMATA and Congress to remedy the impact of these cuts. If these changes are implemented, Georgetown should work to provide support and flexibility to campus workers, as nearly all of Georgetown’s hourly campus workers live in other areas of D.C. or in the suburbs of Maryland and Virginia, according to Taliadoros. 
“These cuts threaten Georgetown workers’ livelihood in obstructing their ability to come to campus and burden them financially by forcing them to rely on more expensive transit options,” Taliadoros wrote.

Georgetown University’s Prisons and Justice Initiative has continued to expand its programs and advance its work with incarcerated people despite the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to its annual report released in November.
The PJI, which was founded in 2016, brings together scholars, practitioners and students to address issues related to mass incarceration. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many of its programs, the PJI 2019-2020 Annual Report highlighted the continued growth of the institution’s team and current projects.
The consequences of the pandemic have been devastating for incarcerated people, making the initiative’s mission to tackle the problem of mass incarceration even more important, according to PJI Director Marc Howard.
“It’s been both challenging and rewarding,” Howard said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It’s helping them get through this extraordinarily difficult phase in their incarceration right now. And that makes it worthwhile and rewarding for us.”
Many PJI programs have been revised and reduced because of the pandemic. The Prison Scholars Program, which enlists Georgetown faculty to teach credit and non-credit bearing courses in the D.C. Correctional Treatment Facility and Central Detention Facility, canceled its non-credit courses indefinitely and has switched all credit-bearing classes to a virtual environment since the spring, according to the report. 
Although the D.C. Department of Corrections provided tablets for inmates to continue taking classes after the pandemic started, PJI faculty can only offer asynchronous courses because the tablets do not have web cameras, according to Howard.
“There’s some connection you can get when you can talk and see the person, but we don’t get to hear their voices, we don’t get to see their faces,” Howard said. “That’s difficult, because we miss them; we care deeply about them.” 
The report also celebrated some achievements, including a $1 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation that was awarded to PJI, in December 2019. The initiative will use the grant to fund the Prison Scholars Program’s expansion to the Patuxent Institution in Jessup, Maryland, according to the report.
Georgetown will offer incarcerated people in Patuxent the opportunity to earn a bachelor’s degree in three different liberal arts majors, PJI Director of Education Joshua Miller said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
“We’re gonna have people graduating with Georgetown degrees in basically interdisciplinary majors, that sort of shape their intellectual journey in ways that I hope come back to campus,” Miller said.
The Pivot Program is another PJI program that has continued to thrive despite the pandemic. The 10-month program is a collaboration among PJI, the McDonough School of Business and Georgetown College that offers a non-credit course in business and entrepreneurship designed specifically for formerly incarcerated people.
Some Pivot fellows have had trouble adjusting to the online learning environment as the program, the only PJI program that takes place on Georgetown’s campus, has been conducted over Zoom since March, according to Howard.
“It’s very hard to do it from the get-go virtually, particularly with people with computers — they’ve been incarcerated for a long time,” Howard said. “Some of them had no experience with computers if they had been in for a long time. But they’ve been incredibly motivated, determined and optimistic.”
Despite these difficulties, the Pivot Program is now in its third year and graduated 16 students in July. 
Tyrone Walker participated in the Prison Scholars Program in 2017 when he was an inmate at the D.C. Jail. After his release from serving a nearly 25-year sentence, Walker graduated from the Pivot Program in 2019, and he still regularly corresponds with inmates in the D.C. Jail. 
“They certainly miss it,” Walker said of in-person PJI classes in an interview with The Hoya. “It took their minds off the things they may be going through. They miss the interaction with their professors.” 
The PJI has also continued its “Prison Reform Project” class for Georgetown undergraduates. The course, taught by Howard, takes on the cases of wrongful convictions and produces documentaries to prove innocence and aid in exoneration. 
Students perform field research by traveling to the crime scene, reinterviewing witnesses and speaking with incarcerated people to produce a documentary on their case, Howard said.
PJI programs have still been valuable to incarcerated people who have otherwise lost many connections to the outside world during the pandemic, according to Howard.
“It’s really something to live for and a way to feel that the outside world still cared about them,”  Howard said. “When you’re incarcerated, there’s already a feeling of abandonment and rejection by society. You feel like you’ve just been discarded, you might as well be on Mars, and our program, we support you and we believe in you which has really kept them going.”
