This summer was a relatively quiet one for campus crime, which dropped by 6 percent from the same period last year.
According to data from the Department of Public Safety, 66 incidents were reported on campus during June, July and August, down from 70 incidents in summer 2011.
More than half of these incidents occurred in July, which saw a total of 35 crimes reported. Theft accounted for the majority of crimes in July, with a total of 14 incidents.
By comparison, June and August saw 15 and 16 incidents reported, respectively. Theft was also the biggest contributor to crime rates in these months, with nine in June and eight in August. However, theft dropped 29 percent between summer 2011 and summer 2012, with 31 occurring in this year’s summer months and 40 having been repoted last summer.
A considerable majority of thefts this summer targeted bicycles and laptops. Bike thefts made up 29 percent and laptop thefts 20 percent of total theft for the summer.
Jay Gruber, Georgetown’s new chief of police, told The Hoya that he recognizes the rampancy of these types of theft on campus and intends to prioritize the issue.
Alcohol violations remained steady throughout the summer, with three incidents in June and two in July. There were three drug violations in July and one in August. The remaining incidents comprised four cases of simple assault, four of public indecency, four unlawful entries, seven burglaries and four robberies, which were all reported to have occurred in July.

Although school was not in session, the Georgetown University Student Association had plenty to keep it busy this summer.
Members of GUSA’s Safe Transitions Working Group have spent the last three months writing and implementing the LGBTQ Safety and Security Report and a list of recommendations in response to the public debate over a proposal to include an LGBTQ-friendly checkbox on freshman housing surveys.
The checkbox drew criticism when it was proposed last spring, including a viewpoint by Nick Shaker (COL ’12) for The Hoya (“Acceptance Shouldn’t Be Optional, But Expected,” A3, March 27, 2012) that condemned the measure for implying that tolerance is optional.
“The opposition said that if you had a checkbox, it would pressure incoming freshmen to identify and isolate the LGBTQ community within freshman dorms,” GU Pride President Meghan Ferguson (COL ’15) said. “[GU Pride] supported having a checkbox as more of a means of opening up a dialogueabout how we can improve the living situation of LGBTQ freshmen who don’t feel safe in their rooms.”
GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) maintained her support for the checkbox but said that the working group aimed to seek out longer-term solutions to intolerance on campus.
“We knew in the first place that [the checkbox] would not solve anything and that it would be short term and catch a few things to help make a few people more comfortable,” she said.
The working group comprised outgoing seniors, underclassmen, LGBTQ individuals and GUSAleaders and focused on how to improve the Georgetown experience for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning students.
Shiva Subbaraman, director of the LGBTQ Resource Center, said the culture of Georgetown poses challenges to LGBTQ students.
“The Georgetown student culture is very conforming in general,” she said. “It is difficult for some students to be different.”
According to GUSA’s report, 57.8 percent of LGBTQ students surveyed strongly agreed that LGBTQstudents face discrimination or alienation at Georgetown, while 66.3 percent reported sometimes, regularly or often feeling uncomfortable because of their identity.
Because of these statistics, the report recommended including a non-discrimination statement that students must sign in order to complete first-year housing.
Gustafson and GUSA Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) began conversations with the Office of Housing and Residence Life over the summer and expect the statement to be implemented by next fall.
Additionally, GUSA plans to implement a “safe spaces” pilot training program this year. The program will train student volunteers to mediate conflict and provide resources to victims of discrimination.
“With any student, it is very challenging to figure out which resources to use … so this would just be one other person who would know what and where these resources are,” Gustafson said.
Information regarding the safe spaces program and how to get involved was included in New Student Orientation packets over the summer to launch the pilot program.
In addition to proposing student solutions, the working group’s report recommended that Georgetown update its blue light emergency phones.
According to Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount, Georgetown’s blue light locations should be better publicized and updated to ensure student safety.
“There is not enough emphasis on blue lights at Georgetown,” Gustafson said.
As per the report’s recommendation, student and administrative leaders involved in emergency response on campus will participate in a blue light walking tour this fall with the Department of Public Safety to point out locations that lack proper security.
The report also discussed the GU Bias Reporting System, an online site where university students and faculty can document issues of prejudice on campus. As of this April, the BRS had not been updated since August 2010.
“Victims and witnesses who file reports need to see results, need to see that they are not alone and be assured that they are … doing the right thing … being responded to efficiently and successfully and … setting great examples for their peers,” the report read.
Bias Reporting Team Chair Dennis Williams said the BRS will be updated in the near future, though he could not say exactly when.
The working group also recommended that the BRS be made more available to students, possibly via Georgetown’s new mobile application.
“We were more focusing on the education side of it, so getting people to know that it’s there,” Gustafson said.
The last recommendation focused on creating a mixed-gender housing option for self- identifiedLGBTQ students.
According to Subbaraman, the LGBTQ Center works with the Office of Housing and Residence Life to accommodate students with different gender identities but does not offer gender-neutral housing.
Kohnert-Yount said she knew of transgender students who initially enrolled at Georgetown but did not stay long enough to graduate.
“That students have come to Georgetown and not found it a welcoming enough place to stay to graduate is unacceptable,” Kohnert-Yount said.
According to Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount, GUSA will focus on implementing the recommendations and maintaining the conversation with the Office of Housing and Residence Life.
“We want every student to come in and feel that Georgetown is a good place for them. Otherwise, we aren’t fulfilling our mission,” Kohnert-Yount said.

When Matthew VanDyke (GRD ’04) returned to the United States after being detained for six months in a Libyan prison, he was already planning his next trip to the Middle East.
“I’m going to start training … for the next Arab revolution,” he told reporters crowded around him at Baltimore/Washington International Airport when he landed on American soil last November.
In a few weeks, VanDyke will follow through on that promise. This time, he will be heading to Syria, where he hopes to film a documentary about the country’s ongoing civil war.
“Syria’s the next step in the Arab Spring movement, the next regime that needs to go,” he said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is the best way I can help.”
He will be filming alongside Masood Bwisir, a Libyan musician famous for singing rebel songs on the front lines during the Libyan revolt.
VanDyke, who has a master’s degree in security studies from the School of Foreign Service, has had a longstanding interest in the Middle East. According to his mother, Sharon, he begged his family to go on a vacation to Egypt during elementary school.
Between 2007 and 2011, VanDyke rode a motorcycle across the Arab world, working as a freelance journalist during the trip. He visited Syria between 2008 and 2009 and says that he saw signs of civilian dissatisfaction with its government even then.
“[Syria] was one of the countries where I heard rumblings of discontent. I was told a story about the police torturing somebody,” he said.
In February 2011, VanDyke called his mother and told her he was booking a flight to Libya so he could write, film and support his friends fighting the dictatorial rule of Col. Moammar Gadhafi. SharonVanDyke didn’t realize that her son would wind up fighting alongside the rebel forces, dressed in army-surplus fatigues and toting a gun.
“You don’t tell your mother you’re going to fight in a war,” VanDyke said at BWI last November.
On March 13, VanDyke and his companions were ambushed by Gadhafi’s forces while on a mission with the rebel army at the strategic oil port town of Brega, according to VanDyke’s website.
He spent the next six months in solitary confinement in a number of government prisons. He was not physically abused, but he told his mother that the isolation was a form of psychological torture.
Meanwhile, as VanDyke’s mother fervently lobbied for her son’s release, the Gadhafi regime denied having ever detaining him.
On Aug. 24, as rebel forces closed in on the capital, VanDyke’s guards fled, and he was able to escape to Tripoli. However, he was not ready to leave Libya just yet. VanDyke announced that he would not return to the United States until Gadhafi was pushed from power. He remained in the country until early November, manning a mounted Russian machine gun for the rebels.
Sharon VanDyke was not surprised by her son’s decision to remain in Libya after his escape or by his vow to return to the Middle East this fall.
“He was raised that if you start something, you finish it,” she said. “Though when I told him that, I meant not joining the lacrosse team and wanting to quit halfway through the season. I didn’t necessarily mean fighting in someone else’s war.”
Sharon emphasized that her son’s upcoming trip will be very different from his trip in Libya last year, and she does not expect him to engage in armed conflict this time around.
“It’s not the same as Libya, where he had friends and wanted to fight alongside them,” she said. “It’s a very different war.”
Yet the violence in Syria is escalating even as VanDyke enters the final stages of his travel planning. Fighting has reached the Syrian capital of Damascus, where dozens have died from shells and gunfire. On Aug. 20, United Nations observers left the country at the end of a four-month mission that failed to negotiate a ceasefire between the government and the rebel army. Overall, the death toll from the war is thought to exceed 20,000.
The dangers of traveling to Syria hit especially close to home last week, when freelance journalist and Georgetown Law student Austin Tice (SFS ’02, LAW ’13) was declared missing while reporting from the war-torn country.
Tice entered Syria through the Turkish border in May and has provided reporting for several media outlets, including The Washington Post and Al Jazeera English.
According to The Post’s report, Tice was due to leave Syria in mid-August, but his family told the newspaper Thursday that they have not heard from him in over a week.
The Committee to Protect Journalists has called Syria the most dangerous place in the world for journalists, reporting that at least 19 journalists have been killed in the country since November 2011.
Michael Hudson, a professor emeritus in the School of Foreign Service and former director of Georgetown’s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, elaborated on the scale and intensity of the conflict.
“The uprising has turned into a full-fledged and militarized civil war,” he said. “When you think of the scale of damage and killing that occurred in our own civil war in the 1860s, this is kind of what you’re looking at. It is a very dangerous thing. … It’s not a joke.”
VanDyke said he was not deterred by the dangers.
“There’s plenty of risk involved … but what happens happens. We’re going to be standing there with the men of the [Free Syrian Army], and whatever happens to them happens to us,” he said.
VanDyke’s trips to Libya and Syria have also created a fair share of controversy. CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon wrote in a November 2011 statement that the confusion over VanDyke’s true purpose in Libya endangered other journalists working there.
“VanDyke told his mother that he was going to Libya to be a journalist. So when he was captured … that’s what she told us,” Simon wrote.
The CPJ worked with Sharon VanDyke to raise alarms about her son’s disappearance and to lobby for his return, but Simon later denounced VanDyke for fighting with the rebels while giving the impression that he would be reporting on the conflict.
“Pretending to be a journalist in a war zone is … a reckless and irresponsible act that greatly increases the risk for reporters covering conflict,” he wrote.
The VanDykes countered this condemnation, saying that they had never claimed that Matthew was traveling to Libya as a reporter.
“Some of the agencies I contacted … assumed he was there as a journalist, but we never said that,” Sharon VanDyke said.
Matthew VanDyke also emphasized that although he will not be fighting in Syria, he won’t be reporting from there, either.
“I am not going to Syria to do anything remotely resembling journalism. I do not want any special treatment if I am captured by Assad’s forces. I want the same fate as the men I am captured with,” he wrote on his website.
VanDyke encountered further controversy when his campaign on Kickstarter, an online fundraising tool, was suspended on Aug. 21. Representatives of Kickstarter declined to comment on the reasons for the suspension.
The campaign, which was launched on July 25, had raised more than $15,000 to buy equipment forVanDyke’s project before it was closed. Undeterred, VanDyke moved his project to a similar site calledIndieGoGo.
VanDyke is optimistic about his documentary’s impact.
“It can inspire people to see the cooperation between a Libyan, an American and a Syrian fighter … and that this cause transcends lines that were drawn on a map by men who got here before we did,” he said. “Understand that this is a human struggle. They can view it as an Arab struggle if they want, but it’s really a human struggle.”

With the annual Student Activities Fair just around the corner, Georgetown’s student groups are planning new ways to attract members and awareness. Relay for Life, Georgetown University College Democrats and College Republicans and the Georgetown University Lecture Fund, among others, have worked this summer to revamp their organizations and gear up for the fall semester.
Same Goal, New Strategy for Relay for Life
After seeing a 30 percent drop in donations last year, Georgetown University Relay for Life is reconsidering its recruitment and fundraising strategies.
According to Special Events Chair Liz Abello (COL ’14), the organization attracts many freshmen at the Student Activities Fair: Approximately 500 students signed up for Relay for Life at last year’s fair. But she said she believes recruiting more upperclassmen is key to future success.
“We are going to do a better job of targeting upperclassmen, because as freshmen, it’s the cool thing to do, but they don’t really come back. They just think of it as a one-time thing,” Abello said. “We want to put emphasis on the fact that this is a fundraising event and people should do more than pay that $10 entry fee.”
This year, Relay plans to advertise the event in locations where more upperclassmen gather.
Maintaining enthusiasm throughout the all-night event is another goal.
According to Survivorship Committee member and 2012 keynote speaker David Weis (COL ’14), only a small group of students stayed for the entire event last year.
“I know that it’s tough because everyone lives right next to the football field, but I would like to see more people actually stay for the entire event,” he said.
Relay for Life plans to hold its first kick-off event in January and then continue to encourage students and the community to begin fundraising early.
“I think a more active, earlier push for fundraising, rather than last-minute emails, would help,” Weis said.
Political Groups Hit the Campaign Trail
With the presidential election around the corner, students on both sides of the aisle are gearing up for what promises to be a roller-coaster campaign season.
Despite differing political views, College Dems and GUCR are teaming up to encourage students to register to vote.
According to Dems President Joe Vandegriff (COL ’14), the two groups are collaborating with the Georgetown University Student Association and D.C. Students Speak to hold a voter registration drive this fall.
College Dems and GUCR plan to campaign respectively for President Barack Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney in Virginia, a key state in the election.
Vandegriff hopes the election will spark political interests and opinions in previously undecided students.
“Too often, kids our age don’t care about politics,” Vandegriff said. “[As] people become more political, they are more likely to think about what they believe, [and] you see undecideds become more active.”
GUCR Director of Communications Katie Bolas (COL ’15) echoed Vandegriff’s hope for more student participation this semester, emphasizing GUCR’s focus on recruiting freshmen.
“One of our main goals is to focus on younger members of the Republican Party. We want to see more permanent members,” she said.
Lecture Fund Nabs Celebrity Speakers, GUSA Partnership
The Georgetown University Lecture Fund is the only club that can truthfully boast about having organized events that included former U.S. President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of StateCondoleezza Rice and controversial author and actor Mike Daisey. This year, GULF plans to invite more celebrity and entertainment figures, according to Vice Chair for External Affairs Aanika Patel (SFS ’13).
The Lecture Fund has also formed a partnership with GUSA this year, resulting in a larger budget for big-name events, according to Patel.
In the past, the Student Activities Commission determined the Lecture Fund’s budget for the year, but the new relationship with GUSA allows the organization to receive funding for events when partnered with organizations outside of SAC.
“We thought that GUSA and its broader scope better fit our goals,” she said.
Actress Rosario Dawson, who has starred in such movies as “Rent” and “Sin City,” will headline the Lecture Fund’s first event in mid-September. Gene Robinson, an Episcopalian bishop and the first openly gay figure in the Anglican Church, will speak in November.

Georgetown Energy, a nonprofit corporation founded by Georgetown students, has chosen a vendor to supply solar panels for university townhouses, but its installation project is still awaiting approval from Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E and the Old Georgetown Board.
The project, called Solar Street, received $250,000 from the Student Activity Fee Endowment to install solar photovoltaic panels on the university-owned townhouses on 37th Street. The group plans to use $50,000 of the allotted amount to install the panels, starting with just seven townhouses in the 1400 block of 37th Street. The remaining money will be put in the Social Innovation and Public Service Green Revolving Loan Fund to provide money for future student projects.
The original timeline for the project planned to have the panels installed over the summer, but the process was delayed because the group had not chosen a solar panel vendor by the April 3 deadline.
According to project leader Patricia Cipollitti (SFS ’15), the group has since chosen to use California-based company SolarCity, the same vendor they included in their original proposal.
“We decided to make it a competitive process to see if we could get a better bid, a lower price, a better offer from another company,” Cipollitti said. “But in the end, we decided that SolarCity had the better package.”
Cipollitti added that the company has previously worked with ANC 2E and has established a good working relationship with the commission, which will help in gaining approval from the ANC and OGB.
According to Cipollitti,  Solar City will present its proposal to the ANC and OGB in September.
Cipollitti is confident that the plans will be approved at the ANC meeting Sept. 4. The boards’ likeliest concern has been identified as the aesthetics of the panels, but in the current proposal they will not be visible from the street.
Georgetown Energy plans to have the solar panels installed by the end of the calendar year.
Cipollitti said that the recent approval of the 2010 Campus Plan will have no effect on Georgetown Energy’s plans.
“As far as we’re concerned, it doesn’t affect anything. We’ve been working closely with the university and facilities, and nothing has come up about that,” she said.
Director of Student Activities Fee and Endowment Implementation Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) agreed.
“The process is moving forward, and I’ve seen no indication that the campus plan will pose a problem to our efforts to complete SAFE reform implementation in a timely manner, as promised to students in January,” he said.

Georgetown saw a flurry of store openings this summer, ranging from a local lobster joint to high-end chains.
According to Nancy Miyahira, Georgetown Business Improvement District’s interim director, several of these new businesses, in particular the new dining options, are geared toward Georgetown students.
“Anything that’s food related is going to provide great new options for students,” Miyahira said.
The neighborhood’s eating options have expanded to include famed chef Mike Isabella’s new Mexican restaurant, Bandolero, on M Street. Macaron Bee dishes up gluten-free macaroons from a storefront on Wisconsin Avenue, and Georgetown alum Luke Holden (MSB ’07) has recently opened a branch of his chain Luke’s Lobster on Potomac Street.
In the upcoming months, they will be joined by three more restaurants.
Good Stuff Eatery, whose Capitol South location is famed for its handcrafted burgers and thick milkshakes, is set to open to the public this winter at the former M Street location of Crêpe Amour and Georgetown Wing Co. However, Miyahira said the opening date is subject to change.
“We have heard the construction is progressing quite quickly, possibly allowing for the opening date to be a bit earlier,” she said.
The national chain Noodles & Company is also set to open during the upcoming year at 1815 Wisconsin Ave., next to Safeway, while Chipotle’s new Asian concept restaurant ShopHouse plans to open a location on M Street in January 2013.
New store openings in the area include several high-end options, ranging from John Fluevog Shoes, a designer store that recently opened on Wisconsin Avenue, to Suitsupply, a specialty men’s suit outfitter from Amsterdam set to open its M Street location in late August. Other additions includeMassimo Dutti, a clothing store owned by the same parent company as Zara, that will open in early 2013.
In addition, Nike is set to move into the old Barnes & Noble space on M Street later this year.
Despite the arrival of several high-end chain retailers, Miyahira maintained that Georgetown still remains a haven for entrepreneurs and small business owners.
“I don’t think there’s a trend either way,” she said. “Georgetown is always a great incubator for entrepreneurs that want to open their own store or business. … There are still a lot of independent stores opening in Georgetown, in addition to the national retailers.”
Miyahira highlighted Georgetown Cupcake and Baked & Wired, another popular cupcake purveyor, as classic examples of small-business success in Georgetown.
Philip Levy, owner of the independent Bridge Street Books on M Street, said that the influx of national chains is part of a trend that has been taking place for about 10 years. Though nonplussed by the disappearance of small businesses to date, he said that Georgetown remains an environment in which independent businesses can thrive.
“This is nothing that surprises me. … It’s a fact of retail in America,” he said. “People complain about our prices [compared to larger chain booksellers], but they realize that we provide something that other bookstores don’t provide, and that’s why we still exist.”
Levy added that most of his block on M Street is made up of locally owned businesses.
“People make fun of Georgetown as being an open-air mall, but I like to think of it in terms of how many small businesses are left in Georgetown,” he said.

Propelled by a reunion weekend that broke fundraising records, Georgetown’s ongoing capital campaign secured $179 million in donations in fiscal year 2012.
The campaign, titled “The Campaign for Georgetown: For Generations to Come,” is a 10-year, $1.5 billion fundraising effort that was publicly launched last fall. Fiscal year 2012 was the first of the campaign’s public phase, but the initiative has been quietly collecting funds since 2007. Thus far, the campaign has earned $919 million, more than 60 percent of its goal.
The $179 million raised this fiscal year, which ended in June, made it the second most successful fundraising year in the university’s history and topped the campaign’s initial goal of $137 million by about 30 percent.
“We expected that the launch year would be a very strong year … but I was very pleasantly surprised by how substantially we exceeded the goal,” Vice President for Advancement Bart Moore said.
The year’s fundraising was buoyed by almost $80 million in contributions from this year’s reunion classes, which gather every five years. This number topped the previous record for a five-year reunion cycle — $47 million — by 70 percent.
According to Moore, a large amount of the campaign’s total fundraising has come from especially large donations: Gifts of $1 million or more accounted for almost half of this year’s total results.
“There’s a disproportionate impact of a relatively small number of the biggest gifts,” Moore said.
He added, however, that the university is hoping to expand its donor base, which would increase the number of alumni who give to the school.
“It is very important to us that people consider Georgetown worthy of their giving, no matter how big or small their gift might be,” Moore said.
According to Moore, Georgetown has made strides in that direction. This year, undergraduate donation participation topped 30 percent for the first time since 2006, a statistic that could potentially impact Georgetown’s spot in national rankings. According to U.S. News and World Report’s annual college survey, Georgetown currently ranks 30th nationwide in undergraduate alumni donations.
“We believe we can and should do better than that,” Moore said. “The passion for and the commitment to Georgetown [are] absolutely present. … We think we need to do a better job of making the case and facilitating people’s annual practice of giving to the university.”
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated that undergraduate donation participation topped 50 percent this year for the first time since 2006. The actual number is 30 percent. Georgetown also ranks 30th nationwide in this metric, not 28th. The corrected version was posted at 3:28 p.m. on Aug. 28.

With fresh grass adorning a new lawn on one side and construction equipment making its final exit from the other, Regents Hall opened its doors to students and faculty for the first time Monday.
The six-story, $100 million science center contains research and teaching labs, classroom spaces, offices and student study areas and lounges.
The first two floors are dedicated to teaching and the fourth and fifth floors to research, while the third floor is split between research and teaching spaces. The unoccupied sixth floor contains the mechanical components for the building.
According to Ali Whitmer, senior associate dean for strategic planning and faculty development, teaching floors are separated based on subject — physics, chemistry and biology — while research floors are mixed to facilitate interdisciplinary research.
“That was a big goal of the building, to improve all of our facilities and provide better research and teaching facilities, but also to promote interdisciplinary research,” Whitmer said.
Colorful and comfortably furnished student lounges and study areas are also scattered on both classroom and research floors.
To allow late-hour student access, research wings contain GOCard entry doors that permit students to study in the lounge area but block research labs at night. The new design differs from Reiss, which only has general GOCard access and therefore cannot serve as a student study space, according to Whitmer.
There is a central mechanical core that allows for big, open labs with separate compartmentalized spaces and provides easier temperature and air control. This feature will also facilitate future lab alterations.
Regents Hall was designed to employ as many sustainable practices as possible, including automatic shut-off lights, renewable bamboo wood paneling, recycled glass white boards and a water-recycling cistern system.
Whitmer said that the university hopes the building will attain the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold Standard, a decision that will be made in the fall after the facility is evaluated.

Now in his fifth week as the new chief of police and director of the Department of Public Safety, Jay Gruber has already set goals for his term. The Hoya sat down with him to get his perspective on neighborhood relations, student partying and the state of DPS in general.
What is your career background?
I spent 26 years at … the University of Maryland, College Park. I started at the Police Academy there and worked my way through every operational rank. … [I spent] the last 10 years as the assistant chief of police and the assistant director of public safety.
I had the opportunity to retire from the University of Maryland. It worked out well for me because prior to that, I got to do a six-month fellowship with the [Federal Bureau of Investigation] in the police executive fellowship program. It’s a national joint terrorist task force working on campus issues, campus counter-terrorism issues, raising awareness on campuses about terrorism, things like that.
I was assigned to [an FBI] program called the Campus Liaison Initiative. … I helped develop programs and marketing for them to reach out to the campuses to give them information about what to look for in potential terrorists on campus. … I developed a lot of great marketing material that liaison agents could take to the campuses to introduce themselves and what they do.
What does the job of chief of police entail?
My position now is chief of police and director of public safety, so I’m really very focused on just this department, where my predecessor had emergency management, Department of Health and Safety and public safety. I have a lot of responsibility here, not only dealing with the department from an interdisciplinary standpoint — you know, budgets, hiring, personnel, policy, all those things that are germane to the police department — but also being responsible to really be the person — the point person — for public safety and for law enforcement. … A big part of that is dealing with the community and university relationships.
My focus here is interdisciplinary on the day-to-day running of the police department, but it’s also working with the community, working with residence life, working with the different organizations on campus. … That’s the part of the job that I really enjoy, getting out and meeting people.
What weaknesses do you see in the department currently?
Georgetown has a real nice foundation for a lot of their safety infrastructure, access control systems, Blackboard. … They have alarm systems in several places [and] a good lock and key system, but one of the gaps that I see is integrating all that. Georgetown’s in decent shape, but from a 5,000-foot view, I think a second look needs to be taken at how those functions are all integrated together, maybe under one roof or one system of management.
How do you plan to improve relations between the university and the surrounding neighborhood? What is your top priority as chief of police?
I think that a productive town-gown relationship is good for everybody, so I really need to learn that dynamic. I’ve been meeting with some of the [Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E] players; they’re great to work with. They’re exuberant. [Saying] “they’re excited” is putting it mildly.
It’s important for me to keep the community involved. The whole reason we’re here is to support the university, to support the students. So getting information out there is something that’s extremely important, and I want to do that in the most effective way. … [University spokeswoman] Stacy Kerr and I will be working on the best venue to get that information out. You can count on the fact that information is going to be shared with the community.
Students have often complained that DPS is too eager to seek out and punish petty student behavioral breaches and is less effective at stopping property and violent crime. What do you see as the relationship between those two mandates, and do you plan to balance those priorities?
Thankfully for the Georgetown community, crimes against persons aren’t a huge issue, and I’m very thankful for that. Property crime, as I’m quickly learning, is a concern. … There are a couple priorities for us. One is to reduce theft. That’s a major focal point of the coming semester and the coming year.
Now, there’s also another priority for us; it’s keeping students safe, and it’s maintaining order. Trust me, as a police officer, we don’t get a whole lot of joy out of telling students they can’t do something, that they have to stop having a party and things of that nature, because it’s instantly confrontational. Nobody likes confrontation. Not the police officer, not the person being told what they have to do — but we have a responsibility.
If people who are drinking are under the age of 21, we have an obligation to stop that activity. It’s not pleasant, but it’s something that we have to do. People who are under 21 that are intoxicated … are vulnerable. They’re vulnerable to different types of crime. … They’re vulnerable to being assaulted; they’re vulnerable to citizen robbery; they’re vulnerable to having to be taken … to the hospital. So those are all concerns for us.
Unfortunately for the students, when an officer breaks up their party, their reaction is that “the cops are just here to break up my party,” but they don’t see the whole other picture of what they do on campus. Protecting VIPs, controlling the campus, doing plainclothes assignments looking for people ripping off laptops, staking out bikes. They don’t see the whole picture of what public safety does. They see a very small microcosm of that. Maybe part of my job … is to let the university community know we’re doing so many things within public safety. Hopefully through this education process, they’ll have some small appreciation that these officers aren’t just there to break up their parties and make their lives miserable.”
