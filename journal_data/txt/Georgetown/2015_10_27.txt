Georgetown Scholarship Program student Amber Athey (COL ’16) never thought finding a place to live senior year would be so hard. Although the university considers GSP students as low-income, Athey was placed on a wait list for senior housing and told that her chances of finding an affordable on-campus residence were slim.
“Low-income students are supposed to have on-campus housing guaranteed for four years,” Athey said. “However, I was not given housing eligibility, and when I asked how I could appeal this process, I was told that there was no way and that I was basically stuck off-campus.”
The on-campus housing scarcity for seniors can be traced to the 2010 Campus Plan, which promised to house 90 percent of undergraduate students on campus by fall 2025. To achieve this goal, the university instituted a three-year housing requirement in 2014, replacing a previous two-year housing requirement and making it harder for fourth-year students to secure one of the university’s limited residences.
Although an additional 385 students began living on campus this fall with the opening of the Former Jesuit Residence and conversion of two floors of the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center into dorms, 100 seniors of the 750 who applied for eligibility were not initially offered on-campus housing by the university, according to Executive Director of Residential Services Patrick Killilee.
Athey was one of those 100 students who did not receive housing. As a result, she said that her financial aid housing stipend does not cover all $1,350 of her monthly rent and utilities expenses or the three months of rent she paid for summer housing. The money she earns from her jobs was factored into her financial aid package, leaving her with little money for personal expenses.
“I don’t go out to eat with my friends,” Athey said. “I hardly ever buy drinks at a bar. To cut utilities payments, I limit my time in the shower, spend most of my time in my room with the lights off and hand wash all of my dishes to avoid running the dishwasher. When I’m shopping at Safeway, I mainly buy store brand and always make sure there is a sale before I purchase something.”

Changes On and Off-Campus
Athey’s story may soon become an anomaly with the opening of more on-campus housing such as the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall next year. This year, 82 more seniors applied for on-campus housing for 2016-2017 than did last year, and the housing office approved all 833 applicants, according to Killilee.
Assistant Dean for Residential Living Stephanie Lynch wrote in an email to The Hoya that the changes in university housing policy are meant to make the student body feel more of a sense of community.
“A primary goal of Georgetown’s master planning process is making campus a more residential, student-centered living and learning community,” Lynch wrote.
Students who study abroad, transfer in or take a leave of absence do not have to fulfill the three-year housing requirement. The Office of Residential Living also worked with the Georgetown University Student Association and the Office of Student Financial Services to provide a four-year guarantee for students who are considered by the university as having high financial need. The exact criteria for this classification are not publicly disclosed. Last year, 150 fourth-year students were granted senior housing for financial reasons, according to Killilee.
The three-year requirement has been met with mixed feelings. Megan Pohl (COL ’17) said that living off campus entails a series of issues she did not consider before the three-year rule’s implementation.
“I like having the convenience of being near campus,” Pohl said. “Living in D.C., you’re going to pay a hefty price either way you run it and having the convenience through Georgetown of housing, Wi-Fi, everything, are just as important to me. So living off-campus brings a landlord and all of those different steps. I don’t want to have to hassle with it if I don’t have to.”
Patty-Jane Geller (COL ’17) fears that the housing rule will prevent her from being able to find roommates who are willing and able to pay for off-campus living and make her own housing costs more affordable.
“My two best friends and I are trying to find an off-campus house, but we’re worried about finding other people who can live with us,” Geller said. “We could think we could pull in people who are younger than us but we can’t do that now because they have to stay on campus.”
A Changing Marketplace
Students aren’t the only ones who have been affected by the new rule. James Mula, a landlord in the Burleith and West Georgetown neighborhoods, has seen the housing market shift dramatically over the last 25 years.
“The biggest change is that [the new policy] has slowed the market down,” Mula said. “Over the last couple years, it was getting crazy. [Housing] caused a lot of panic among students, which was unnecessary, and I think it allowed some of these guys with pretty terrible houses to grab students who were just in a panic.”
Based on experience in the neighborhood housing market, Mula said that he believes the drop in off-campus demand gives seniors less competition against other renters and forces unresponsive landlords to compete for the students who are searching for a residence.
“[Bad landlords] won’t be able to command those top dollars … just because students would be able to shop around a little more and not be rushed in to take it or leave it,” Mula said.
Steers Center for Global Real Estate Director Matthew Cypher agreed with Mula’s analysis and said that in the long run, the policy will help students.
“Real estate is very simple,” Cypher said. “It’s a relationship between the supply of space and the demand of space. When you had two years’ worth of Georgetown students living off campus, the demand was strong, and potentially exceeded the available supply that was present.”
According to what Cypher’s students have told him, the pressure to find housing off campus is not as prevalent as it has been in past years.
“I think that landlords are being a bit more accommodative to tenants,” Cypher said. “They may be willing to accept a lower rent to ensure they have tenants in the space, whereas before they might have been able to drive a harder bargain.”
However, even though the market may settle in the long run, low-income students are at a disadvantage in the short term if they are not granted eligibility through the lottery in future years.
“If there are juniors who can afford to live off campus and want to live off campus, that would open up spots for seniors who can’t afford it,” Athey said. “I just don’t think it’s the right solution to force people off campus who want to live on campus.”
Still, Mula and Cypher think the policy will end up gradually helping all parties involved.
“I think in one sense it will help the Georgetown community overall because through attrition, we get rid of some of the bad operators,” Mula said. “It definitely will give students a better chance of procuring housing that’s safe and paying what they’re getting for instead of some hell hole.”

The Office of Advancement hosted the inaugural biennial Black Alumni Summit from Friday to Sunday, in which more than 230 alumni gathered for three days of social activities, networking events and panel discussions on Georgetown’s continued influence on their personal and professional lives.
The participants included alumni from around 40 graduating classes in a range of different professions, with alumni networking events open to current black students.
The summit was a joint effort between a network of black alumni and the Office of Advancement. The Office of the President, the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access and the Georgetown Alumni Association also assisted with planning the event.
Eric Woods (GSB ’91), who served as co-chair of the summit’s planning committee, said the event demonstrated the mutually beneficial nature of the relationship between black alumni and the university.
“I think it serves the administration to understand that this community is engaged, does care and will stand up when asked. I think what it will do is create more symbiosis going forward between [black alumni and the university],” Woods said.
University President John J. DeGioia, who spoke at two keynote addresses Friday and Saturday, also said that the summit was significant in maintaining relations between black alumni and the university.
“I am deeply grateful to our alumni who attended this weekend’s events and all those who helped to spearhead this important and unprecedented effort to celebrate our African American alumni community,” DeGioia wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Several alumni members, including Tammee Thompson (CAS ’91), began discussing the possibility of a reunion for black alumni in 2013. Thompson approached Chief of Staff to the Office of Advancement Ben Shaw with the idea after she attended the Black Alumni Summit at Stanford University, where she received her masters in business administration.
Shaw said that the Office of Advancement found the summit to be an effective way for the alumni to plan programming according to their own needs.
“You’re going to be more successful when you allow alumni to organize and connect with the university in ways that they want to … as opposed to in the ways that are the most convenient to the university,” Shaw said.
Over the next year and a half, Thompson and Woods, who served as the co-chairs of the summit planning committee, led a group of around 50 alumni who helped with the event’s programming and outreach efforts.
The Office of Advancement also provided assistance in booking locations on campus and connecting the committee with resources. Most of the events took place in the Rafik B. Hariri Building.
The summit kicked off Friday morning with a keynote luncheon featuring DeGioia and D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson (SFS ’92), who also serves on the university’s board of directors.
Throughout the three days, panelists discussed a range of career fields including sports and entertainment.
The summit also included a panel discussion with Conan Louis (SLL ’73), who was one of around 30 black students at Georgetown when he initially arrived at the university.
According to Woods, Louis recounted that only eight of the black students eventually graduated, as many felt uncomfortable at the university and dropped out.
Woods said that he found Louis’ experience relevant to the summit’s goal of supporting black students from matriculation through to graduation.
“I think we take for granted that only a short time before us, things were drastically different,” Woods said. “One of the takeaways from the summit is to make sure that we help students matriculate into Georgetown, that we do what we can to help them finish at Georgetown and finish strongly.”
In 2008, Georgetown placed fifth place in Black Enterprise’s ranking of Top 50 Colleges for African Americans. This past application cycle, nine percent of admitted students were black.
CMEA Director Charlene Brown-McKenzie said that she found the discussions at the summit to be profound.
“I attended several panels and I was struck by the depth of conversation and the impressive resume of those assembled,” Brown-McKenzie wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Students also participated in alumni networking events. Shaw said that the networking events were good opportunities for students to connect with a large number of alumni.
“Students had the opportunity to connect with black alumni from various career fields, ask for advice and just listen to their stories and experiences. I think that connections like that, they are going to persist beyond the summit,” Shaw said.
Oyetola Oyeyemi (SFS ’16), who was one of the three student panelists at the summit, participated in a panel entitled “The Black Experience on the Hilltop.” She was invited to join the panel during the summer by her Georgetown Scholarship Program faculty mentor, who works at the Office of Advancement.
Oyeyemi said that she enjoyed being able to connect with multiple alumni at a networking event following the panel.
“This was very significant for me because I am not the biggest fan of networking events, and I’m usually pretty shy, but the alumni at the networking session made me feel pretty comfortable, which is something I’ve never felt at a networking session at Georgetown before,” Oyeyemi wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Woods, the summit will convene every other year. Woods said that while the committee has not begun planning for the next summit, he is optimistic that the next summit will grow in size and scope after receiving many positive comments from attendees this year.
“I’m very happy that people who came left in anticipation of seeing each other again and coming back to the school,” Woods said. “Our thought, as a committee and as the co-chair … is that this is something that people want to happen again.”
Shaw said that the Office of Advancement will also consider proposals from other alumni groups to host similar events.
“If another group of alumni came forward with a similar plan and was willing to work with us, we would absolutely be open to that,” Shaw said.
Above all, Shaw said that the summit achieved its purpose of reconnecting alumni with the university community.
“This isn’t just about figuring out ways to raise more money for Georgetown,” Shaw said. “This is about figuring how to get our alumni connected to the student experience and make sure that our students know that our alumni are resources.”

Two Georgetown University Medical Center researchers have discovered a drug that could reverse symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, including cognition and motor function loss.
Georgetown’s Laboratory of Dementia and Parkinsonism Director Charbel Moussa and Movement Disorders Program Director Fernando Pagan led the clinical trial. Twelve patients with Parkinson’s disease received nilotinib, a drug normally used in the treatment of leukemia.
One initial participant had to drop out for unknown reasons, but all 11 patients who completed the trial saw improvements. After treatment, one wheelchair-bound patient could walk on his own and three patients could hold conversations again.
Moussa said the trial has potential to provide new insight into treating Parkinson’s disease. Currently, there is no approved treatment method that can reverse the condition’s symptoms.
“The success of this approach will provide a disease-modifying approach that no other current Parkinson’s medication provides,” Moussa wrote in an email to The Hoya. “All current therapies are for symptom management and do not alter or slow down disease progression, which is a critical goal.”
Pagan agreed and was optimistic about their findings.
“I’ve been treating Parkinson’s patients for over two decades now and I’ve never seen a Parkinson’s drug that improves both motor and non-motor symptoms at the same time the way this drug has, especially in the advanced patients that we were treating,” Pagan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m extremely excited.”
According to Moussa, the drug must go through a series of further tests before it can be prescribed to treat Parkinson’s. The drug will go through two more trials, which will be larger, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials, meaning neither the patients nor the researchers will know if a patient is receiving nilotinib or a placebo. Once this process is complete, the drug can be prescribed for treatment in the next few years.
“If funding becomes available and early data hold out in larger clinical trials, this drug may be clinically available five years from now,” Moussa wrote.
Moussa originally got the idea to use nilotinib to treat Parkinson’s by looking for drugs that regulate a process called autophagy, or the process by which cells destroy themselves. The nilotinib drug normally uses this process to kill cancerous cells from leukemia.
“In neurologic diseases, the cells, called neurons, accumulate toxic proteins which kills the cell — and that’s not good,” Moussa wrote. “We thought if we could turn on the autophagy process for a short time by giving a lower dose of nilotinib, it would lead to the digestion of intracellular neurotoxic proteins and prevent neurodegeneration and disease progression without killing the cell.”
While the drug is normally used in 800-milligram doses to treat leukemia, it was given in 150 to 300 milligram doses in the clinical trial for Parkinson’s disease.
Moussa explained that the drug appears to reverse Parkinson’s by taking advantage of this autophagy process. The drug induces the degradation of brain toxic proteins that are associated with dementia and Parkinsonism, while increasing levels of brain neurotransmitters such as dopamine. Dopamine is known to underlie many brain functions, including movement and mental activity.
The results from the clinical trial appeared to follow this observation.
“The changes in these biomarkers — Tau, p-Tau, α-synuclein and Abeta-40 and 42 — in spinal fluid suggest to us that the drug is working by triggering cells to clean out the toxic proteins in the brain,” Moussa wrote.
For Alan Hoffman, a retired social sciences professor at Georgia State University who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 1997, the effect of the drug proved life-changing. Hoffman started noticing improvements three weeks after beginning the clinical trial.
“I didn’t notice it but everybody else did,” Hoffman said. “I found that it covers up my deficiencies in enunciation and fluency of words … and I thought, ‘Well gosh, the only thing that I’m doing different is taking those pills.’”
Hoffman continued to improve as the trial progressed. In a walking therapy activity, he was able to walk 20 feet twice as fast, going from taking 28 seconds before the trial started, to 14 seconds two months after the trial started. The most noticeable impact, however, was on everyday tasks.
“I find I was able to do a lot of things I would not normally attempt, like emptying the dishwasher, doing lawn and yard work,” Hoffman said. “I found that sometimes I did so much and felt so healthy, that the next day I’d be worn out. I have worked a normal day instead of just a Parkinson’s day.”

This is an extremely exciting possible breakthrough!
Should the upcoming clinical trials prove successful, all patients
suffering from Parkinson’s, their families and caregivers would receive
the ultimate gift, of obtaining quality of life.

This is great news!  Could you test it on MSA patients?  Is there anyway the drug could be fast tracked?  Five years is longer than some have to live and longer than most have to live a productive life.

Georgetown’s Institute for Transformational Leadership at the School of Continuing Studies will debut the certificate in facilitation — a three-month workshop that teaches the skills needed to oversee workplace meetings — next semester as the first certificate in higher education of its kind.
According to Program Coordinator Kathryn Wade, SCS administrators developed the program because they believe facilitation skills are crucial to success in the workplace.
“There’s been a lot of anticipation around the program,” Wade said. “I think it’s one of those activities in the workplace and in the business world that when people are able to do it well, it can really result in some positive change within an organization.”
Associate Dean of the SCS Edwin Schmierer stressed the importance of facilitation skills and echoed Ringel’s optimistic sentiments about the program.
“As research shows, the best work is accomplished in teams, which means those with facilitation expertise and skills are highly valued. Moreover, facilitation is now a must-have skill for leaders, consultants and leadership coaches,” Schmierer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We hope the Certificate in Facilitation program demonstrates how SCS continues to lead in offering experiential, practice-based and relevant leadership programs through the Institute for Transformational Leadership.”
Program applicants are required to have a bachelor’s degree and at least two to four years of experience leading teams. The application deadline is Dec. 1, and students will be notified of admissions decisions about one month later. Each class consists of 18 to 24 students, with meetings on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday one week per month from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The program consists of three modules: Being a Facilitator, The Art of Facilitation: Design and Craft, and Capstone: Facilitating Teams and Groups, that will be completed over a three-month period. The Certificate will include two stages — the technical and the transformational — where participants will learn about both concrete skills and their presence as facilitators.
Students will engage in collaborative and interactive work, including practice in conducting their own meetings, in addition to written assignments outside of the classroom. The program concludes with individual presentations on facilitation projects.
Program Director Rae Ringel highlighted the characteristics of a good facilitator the program will aim to develop in its students.
“There’s an actual craft to how you create and lead experiences of people being together. It’s all the preparation that you do before the experience, to find out what people need and want, and then it’s the facilitator — how they show up in that room and actually manage that room,” Ringel said. “I find that there’s not enough people who are doing this well, and people are increasingly resenting the fact that they have to go to so many of these experiences, and they’re not seeing the return on investment.”
Wade added that Ringel consistently emphasizes the need for good facilitators in the workplace.
“One of the things Rae talks to me about a lot is when someone is great at facilitation, they can bring people together to decide on a collective way forward that’s very positive and beneficial for an organization,” Wade said.
Ringel said the program will help students learn how to deal with current problems in the workplace, like the distraction of technology.
“The challenge we face now with technology is people spend so much time on their devices and social media and on computers,” Ringel said. “When people put down their devices and come together to work, it needs to be awesome.”
Ringel said she is optimistic about what participants will receive from the program.
“My hope is that people go back to their organizations, their schools, their enterprises, with not only a different perspective on how to gather people, but also with really critical skills and tools to be able to engage people in their work,” Ringel said. “[The program is] giving people a tool that they can really use in most places in their life.”

Former University President Leo O’Donovan, S.J. lead Georgetown from 1989 until 2001. Throughout his tenure, O’Donovan reflected upon the evolving Catholic identity of the institution, charging a faculty study on the university’s identity. He also established the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding and hired the first full-time Imam at any American university. The Hoya sat down with O’Donovan to discuss Georgetown’s diversity and the importance of pluralism.
This is part two of a three-part interview. Part three will appear in the news section of The Hoya on Friday.
Can you speak a little bit about your early education?
I also started when I came to New York with some friends, a board for the grammar school I went to here in Manhattan — Corpus Christi school. It’s a wonderful, small school in Morningside Heights, the Columbia neighborhood. … The women were remarkable women; I’ll always be in debt to them. We never got grades because it wasn’t about whether Leo could do better on a test, it was about how each of us could do as well as we could do. We never had report cards because again it was not about competition, it was about cooperation, and your parents went up every six weeks or so I think to talk to your teacher about how you were doing. There was a lot of music and art; the basics of course. The classes were not very small, but smaller than usual in Catholic grammar schools. I learned in seventh grade how to oil paint. I was awful. I also learned — they were very practical our sisters — while the girls were at gym class, she taught the boys how to knit.
How did this type of education impact you?
It was an education for living, and it was imbued — it was a Catholic grammar school — it was imbued with faith. It was also an education in the city of New York. The pastor of the parish sent me to a meeting of the National Conference of Catholics and Jews. He sent me to a conference — I forget who actually sponsored it — but it was a meeting of young white students and young black students. We had no black students in my class, but it was the first experience I had of really socializing with young black people. When I went to Georgetown, it was a very Caucasian, very, almost exclusively, Catholic college. There were a few Jewish students that I was very happy to get to know, who told me years later that I was one of the people who made them feel at home, which I would hope. When I went back to Georgetown as president, the change in the student body — a much more diverse student body, which is a better educational situation in my view — the change in the student body was remarkable, and I tried to do my very best to maintain that and promote it, while still supporting the notion of Georgetown as a Catholic institution. So, we did a long study when I was president. Basically, it was the faculty group that did the study and then came up with the final paper, and the very pregnant and insightful central phrase of that study was that education at Georgetown was based on a centered pluralism; pluralism of approaches to education and life that never the less came from a centering tradition. And I’m still very proud of that notion, and I think the university, whether those exact terms are used or not, is very much like that.
Since you took over as president in 1989, Georgetown has continued to expand in its diversity, and its student body and larger community are now compromised of a wide variety of people. As Georgetown was growing, what were the struggles between maintaining its Catholic tradition but also recognizing the importance of fostering other ideas as an academic institution — even if they conflicted with Catholic teaching?
Well, let me say something first about American culture itself. I think it’s clear that we had been a largely Caucasian, Protestant culture dominated by East Coast institutions, and we are now a much more diverse country with the Protestant churches in a minority, an ascendant Hispanic community, a great variety of Christian communities with Evangelicals and more traditional, more Fundamentalist churches or communions taking a very significant role. The place of the Jewish community in American culture has remained, I would say, very steady. The percent of Jews in America is about the same as it was when I went to college and continues to be culturally and politically very significant, but the numbers, I don’t think have changed significantly. There is a significantly greater interest in Islam, but the Muslim population is not very large. The Muslim influence around the world is of course of great significance.
I think a college — or a university — with all those various dimensions and forms of community life is immensely valuable, especially for undergraduates whose basic perspectives on life are forming and very often your basic friendships. And it’s not simply in classes, although, I think what the university offers in terms of curriculum is significantly stronger and more diverse now. It’s also a matter of social life, activities that people are in. When we did the Centered Pluralism study the faculty became convinced that “associational life” on the campus was of immense intellectual importance. That’s a phrase that’s goes back to Tocqueville when he made his famous visit to America and wrote about democracy here. He noted that Americans seemed to have a special bent and a special aptitude for forming various sorts of associations, which made the body politic work, but were not strictly political, and to me that is still the case. That’s just a word about the United States. But then there’s the international point of view, and I think it’s always been a great benefit of Georgetown to be international. That was the case from the very start, with significant numbers of students from outside the colonies. At times that internationalism declined, but it is our tradition to be so. Now the world has become at once more united — globalization is a shorthand for that — and yet the perils inherent in globalization have become more evident — and nowhere more so than in the fact that a globalized economy means a level of power in the economy that single countries can’t easily control, so that the economy becomes the most significant force in shaping the lives of people and very often to the detriment of poor people. So, as the traditional notion of the nation’s state has weakened, the power of international economy has strengthened. That’s something I think our students need to learn and become sensitive to.
A third level or perspective with regard to what has changed is the religious perspective. Until about 20 years ago or so, the secularization thesis was firmly in place. Namely, that as society, politics and economics became more independent of religious authority, religious authority would decline and eventually disappear. At the same time, the relevance of a transcendent dimension, the place of God in human life, would gradually disappear. Well, that hasn’t proved to be the case, especially in the United States, which remains a very religious country — less so today perhaps, but we remain nevertheless a fundamentally religious county. And we’ve become aware in the last 20 years that religious communities and the faiths that we find in the world shape societies, social decisions and even the economy. So, the place of Islam, with a billion and a half adherents, commands much more attention today. You notice I don’t start by speaking of Islamic extremism. I’m talking about our becoming more aware that we have many, many brothers and sisters we have who hold the Islamic faith. They are indeed our brothers and sisters — and I’m very proud of the fact that we have real strength at Georgetown and building strengths in Islamic Studies and the Arabic language. That expertise is indispensable for living together.
In the Catholic Church in which I’m very happy to be a priest — a Roman Catholic priest and a Jesuit — our new pope, Francis, has brought a sense of dialogue to the very center of Catholic living. He starts, in my view, with people’s problems and concerns and needs, not with rules and principles and laws. He knows the formal structures very well. I think he’s well aware of what the rules, what the laws of the church are, but he doesn’t start there. He starts with the person who presents herself or himself as in need. And in a very special way, I think, in his latest encyclical, Laudato Si’, he presents for discussion throughout the world the great problem of our environment and, as he puts it, the care for our common home. I think he’s being exact and forthright when he says he would like to enter a dialogue about this. He never in the letter appeals to his authority as the bishop of Rome except insofar as he does say that what he’s proposing is in continuity with popes since John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul II, Benedict XVI. He intends, in continuity with them, to contribute to the social teachings of the church. But that’s about as far as he goes to emphasize his authority. The authority of the letter is from what he has to say. I think it’s very persuasive. In a recent issue of the New York Review of Books — scarcely a Diocese newspaper — there is a brilliant article interpreting the encyclical and in an extremely positive way. I know there are people who would say there is this wrong with it, or that wrong with it, or I object to this or that. I don’t think Francis will have any problem with that, because he doesn’t propose the letter as the final truth, and he doesn’t propose it as something fully satisfactory — on the contrary. What he is proposing is an issue of urgency for the whole world. So, here too the principle of dialogue has taken a place in Catholicism, which I think is very promising and much more humane.

The Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority launched Amplify, a website aiming to give riders a greater voice in local public transit, Oct. 15.
Amplify will offer multiple channels through which riders can communicate with both WMATA and other riders, including online polls, surveys and discussion forums. Interested users can create Amplify accounts online. The ultimate goal is to include more customer input in WMATA policy decisions.
WMATA Director of Customer Research Jason Minser emphasized the creation of Amplify as a response to the call for increased communication with riders.
“We’re always looking for new and better ways to engage our customers,” Minser said.  “While we certainly do it now through a number of different channels, we didn’t have anything that would sustain interaction so that we were getting a constant stream of input.”
The site currently has a cap of 5,000 riders allowed to sign up for membership. However, if the initial launch is successful, WMATA will consider opening Amplify to all Metro and bus riders.
According to a Metro press release, WMATA hopes to receive feedback on service changes, marketing materials and overall customer experience. WMATA also plans to release a monthly newsletter for Amplify members to demonstrate how customer comments have affected transit policy decisions.
The call for input from the customer community comes after recent controversy surrounding WMATA’s operation. Earlier this month, the Washington D.C. Metro was the first subway system to be placed under federal jurisdiction due to a lack of safety regulations.
Additionally, dissatisfaction with WMATA inspired the formation of an independent Riders’ Union in September.
Amplify’s first poll respondents conveyed how much they feel WMATA cares about their daily interaction with the bus and rail system. Fifty percent of participants responded “very little” or “not at all” and only 15 percent chose “quite a bit” or “a great deal.”
WMATA Riders’ Union Communications Director Graham Jenkins highlighted Amplify as a possible sign of change in how WMATA handles complaints.
“I would hope that this is a way to channel those suggestions more constructively and turn them into specific policy platforms. The idea that they’re actually accepting criticism is a new thing,” Jenkins said.
“This seems to have room for legitimate criticism, so that’s a good sign.”
Lynn Bowersox, WMATA’s assistant general manager of customer service, communications and marketing, assured the organization’s confidence in the site.
“This tool gives customers the convenience of sharing their thoughts and opinions at times and in places that work for them, including on the go,” Bowersox said in a press release announcing Amplify. “We believe that Amplify will become a valuable tool in building the relationship between Metro and our customers.”
Mike Donnay (COL ’16) expressed doubt that the university student community will be able to provide the interest WMATA is seeking.
“As a college student who has very limited time in D.C., I’m not super invested in it getting better,” Donnay said. “There are certainly parts of it that frustrate me, but I don’t imagine that an app or website will suddenly inspire me to engage with the Public Transit Authority in any more meaningful way than I do.”
Suzanne Trivette (COL ’16), who uses the bus system for her job commute to DuPont, however, said she is hopeful that the service will be able to further connect riders with WMATA.
“I feel like that could be helpful, in terms of people making suggestions and feeling like the transportation system cares about them,” Trivette said.

GU Fossil Free published and circulated an open letter written by an anonymous alumnus calling for the university to divest its endowment from the top 200 fossil fuel companies, amassing one signature as of press time.
The group published the letter on its website Oct. 9. It is the first open letter to be published by GUFF since the board of directors voted to end direct investments in coal companies in early June, a decision that GUFF criticized for being insufficient.
The letter reiterated GUFF’s goal for the university to fully divest from the top 200 oil, coal and gas companies based on carbon reserves.
“We, the alumni of Georgetown University, respectfully ask the board of directors to divest the university’s endowment from the top 200 fossil fuel companies based on carbon reserves,” the letter read.
The letter also cited scientific research published on National Geographic and the Environmental Protection Agency website on the effects of fossil fuel burning on the environment.
“These abrupt changes [in average global temperature] have already resulted in more severe and frequent heat waves, storms, droughts, and floods,” the letter read.
The letter concluded by calling the university to implement more sustainable measures in its wider plans, beginning with divestment.
“By divesting, we stand for those who cannot stand for themselves and protect an Earth that is currently being silenced,” the letter read. “For this reason, Georgetown can and must take the lead in moving us away from fossil fuel dependence, and that begins with divesting and helping to shift the dialogue toward true sustainability.”
In April, GUFF released a letter signed by faculty members that supported divestment, and it accrued 113 signatures. The letter, which was drafted by professor Nathan Hensley, was released toward the end of an academic year marked by demonstrations by GUFF and negotiations between the group and the university.
According to GUFF member Annie Wang (COL ’16), the group decided to release the alumni open letter based on the effectiveness of the faculty letter.
“I think [we chose this tactic] because we saw how successful it was with the faculty,” Wang said. “We thought it would be a good way to rally alumni.”
GUFF member Grady Willard (SFS ’18) said the group wanted the letter to draw broader support for divestment in order to pressure the university.
“If we can get a broad coalition of constituencies to support divestment, we believe that the university will be more likely to follow through with full divestment from oil and gas,” Willard wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Wang, the group is circulating the letter to alumni through “mostly email and social media,” with  “some word of mouth.”
Willard also said that the group is collaborating with former GUFF members to facilitate the circulation among alumni.
Although GUFF does not have an estimate for the number of signatures that they hope to collect, Wang said the organization is hoping to see the same success that they found with the faculty letter.
“We’re trying to get a hundred, maybe a couple hundred,” Wang said.
Willard also said that the alumni letter would eventually be delivered to the university administration.
Elaine Colligan (SFS ’15) praised the letter for supporting its argument with scientific facts. She has yet to sign the letter.
“I think it lays out the science behind climate change well,” Colligan said.
Colligan also said that she anticipates the letter to gain further traction as it circulates among alumni.
“I expect tons and tons of alumni to put a lot of pressure on Georgetown to divest,” Colligan said.
Aside from the letter, Wang said that one of GUFF’s main goals for the semester is to keep up with the board of directors, in addition to increasing student outreach efforts.
“We’re trying to get more contact with the board of directors,” Wang said. “I think what we want to see is getting a broad community of support.”
Willard also said that GUFF will continue to promote its agenda to the university community this semester.
“GUFF will continue to advocate for full divestment from oil and gas, as well as administrative transparency,” Willard wrote.

The Walsh Scholars Initiative, a program supervised by the School of Foreign Service Academic Council to promote careers in the public sector, received applications for its first class of participants over the past weeks.
Applications for the yearlong program were due yesterday. Institute for the Study of Diplomacy Ambassador Barbara Bodine, who directs the WSI, declined to provide the number of applications received.
Freshmen, sophomores and juniors in the SFS were eligible for the program, which will accept five applicants.
Walsh Scholars receive a professional mentor, personalized career guidance and a stipend to pursue an internship in public service for the summer of 2016. Throughout the academic year, participants will attend monthly events, including dinners, workshops and formal networking sessions with professionals, alumni and professors.
In addition to these events, the program also provides workshops on professional skills such as writing, briefing and research.
SFSAC President and WSI Student Director Anna Hernick (SFS ’16) said she was pleased with the applications they have received.
“We’ve been really happy with the caliber and the quantity of applications,” Hernick wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We expected students to be excited about it, but the response from students has really been great, so I think that reinforces the fact that this program is needed.”
Hernick said that the program will help students develop a diverse range of skills to focus on potential career choices.
“We plan on offering a good variety of events in order to build a community, but also to give them practical, tangible skills that they can take with them,” Hernick wrote.
The WSI was established last year by former SFSAC President Megan Murday (SFS ’15) and former SFSAC Senior Class Representative Annie Kennelly (SFS ’15). The program grew out of the academic council’s efforts to balance the disproportionate emphasis placed on private-sector recruiting they have observed in recent years.
According to a report from the Cawley Career Education Center, only 11 percent of SFS graduates in the Class of 2014 found jobs in nonprofit and public service work, while only six percent held positions in government. By contrast, 25 percent of graduates entered into consulting services and 15 percent took jobs in the financial sector.
Kennelly said that her two years on the opportunities committee of the SFSAC, which publicized internships and entry-level jobs to SFS students, opened her eyes to this disparity.
“That experience brought to light how few viable opportunities exist for undergraduates to pursue a career in government and public service,” Kennelly wrote in an email to The Hoya. “WSI grew out of that void.”
Murday expressed similar concerns on the general student body’s disinterest in the public sector.
“[Kennelly] and I discussed the oftentimes confusing, unpaid and overlooked route to a career in the public sector,” Murday wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Too frequently, our best students gave up on or postponed public-sector jobs in order to pursue a more financially-secure position with well-known firms.”
Murday said that the SFSAC will continue to work with WSI to serve as an important source of planning and feedback.
“As WSI came from the SFSAC, I hope that WSI and the SFSAC will have a long-term, collaborative relationship,” Murday wrote.
Murday and Kennelly met with Bodine last year to launch the program and enlisted help from the SFS Dean’s Office and other faculty members. Bodine had run a similar program called The Scholars in the Nation’s Service Initiative during her time at Princeton University.
“WSI will be an internship program that creates a nexus of Georgetown’s outstanding faculty, Washington’s vast professional opportunities, and motivated SFS students,” Kennelly wrote. “It will be a community … who will work on creating a pipeline to public service careers that improve the world in meaningful ways.”
Maximilian Fiege (SFS ’18), an applicant to the program, said that he hopes to receive more regular support in finding a public-sector job, especially in light of the extensive recruitment by the private sector on campus.
“You have Deloitte coming every week, you have Goldman Sachs all the time, but there’s no real recruiting channel for the public sector, especially in the realm of foreign affairs,” Fiege said. “With the WSI, you get mentorship opportunities and internship guarantees, and that finally elevates the public sector to the standard of the private sector.”
Vanessa Sorrentino (SFS ’18), another applicant, echoed this sentiment and said that this program upholds the university’s Jesuit values.
“In Georgetown’s emphasis on things like ‘men and women for others,’ we’re instilled with this sense of pride in service,” Sorrentino said. “To apply that to a professional setting is something many of us want to do, [and] the WSI makes this easier.”
Hernick said that she hopes the WSI will allow students to form positive connections with the community around them.
“Students come into Georgetown with the idea that they want to use it as a pathway to public service, but … it’s not always so obvious how to make that happen,” Hernick said.

Starbucks applied for liquor licenses for five of its Northwest Washington, D.C. locations earlier this month as part of the expansion of its “Starbucks Evenings” offerings.
The Wisconsin Avenue, Seventh Street and three Connecticut Avenue locations are all included in the application. If approved, these stores would begin to serve wine and craft beer, along with small gourmet dishes, from 2 to 11 p.m. on weekdays and noon to 11 p.m. on weekends.
The Starbucks location in the Leavey Center was not included in the corporation’s application for D.C. liquor licenses.
Starbucks applied for D.C. Alcoholic Beverage licenses from the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration. According to a Notice of Public Hearing posted online by the ABRA, Starbucks applied for five Class D alcoholic licenses and has a hearing date set for Dec. 7.
ABRA Public Affairs Specialist Jessie Cornelius explained that a Class D license allows for the sale and consumption of solely wine and beer in an email to The Hoya. She added that the final approval of the license is up to discretion of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.
Following the 2010 debut of the “Starbucks Evenings” at the Starbucks in Seattle, the corporation plans to introduce the expanded menus at more than 2,000 of its 12,000 stores in the United States, according to USA Today. As of August, more than 70 stores offered “Starbucks Evenings.”
Starbucks spokesperson Courtney Edelman said Starbucks selected specific locations for alcohol selections based on the preferences of local customers and surrounding neighborhoods.
“Just as each customer is unique, so are our stores and we consider a broad range of products and experiences for each neighborhood,” Edelman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
On its website, the company cited data regarding customer preferences as impetus for the “Starbucks Evenings” locations.
According to Starbucks, 70 percent of its customers drink wine, as compared to 30 percent of the general U.S. population.
The “Starbucks Evenings” stores are all corporate locations, meaning they are operated directly by Starbucks. In general, non-corporate stores of food vendors are referred to as licensed, including Subway, Cosi and the Starbucks location in the Leavey Center. Edelman declined to comment further regarding the potential expansion of “Starbucks Evenings” to licensed stores.
Aramark Marketing Manager Adam Solloway said that because the Starbucks at Leavey Center is not a corporate location, it is unlikely that it will sell alcoholic drinks.
Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Business Services Joelle Wiese, however, said it is possible that the location on campus could offer alcohol, pending approval from Starbucks.
“Starbucks has to approve licensed stores to actually take on and actually adopt that particular program that has the alcohol,” Wiese said.
She added that if “Starbucks Evenings” are expanded to licensed stores, the university would also have to approve the sale of alcohol in the Leavey Center location.
Wiese said the possibility of the university Starbucks location serving alcohol is still a hypothetical.
“There would be other concerns we’d have to take into consideration, like Epicurean has an alcohol liquor license and they serve drinks,” Wiese said. “I don’t know anything about the entire program until we are presented with it from Starbucks.”
The five Northwest D.C. locations and Leavey Center shop all declined to comment.
Tori Goodell (COL ’16) said that the Starbucks brand is not usually synonymous with a bar-like atmosphere.
“I don’t think I would go to Starbucks for a night time venue mostly because I don’t associate a girl’s night out with a coffee shop,” Goodell said. “But it will be interesting to see if it picks up.”
Emily Jin (COL ’16) agreed and doubted how successful “Starbucks Evenings” would be in D.C. locations.
“I personally go to Starbucks to work, sometimes to catch up with friends. I think if they start serving alcohol, that could create a different culture and ambience, which might cause them to lose some patrons,” she said.
Maxwell Menard (SFS ’16), however, was more optimistic about the possibility of purchasing alcohol at the coffee chain.
“I support Starbucks serving alcohol. A lot of people go to coffee shops to catch up with friends, and during the afternoon I don’t see anything wrong with patrons having a couple of beers instead of a couple of cups of coffee,” Menard said.

The Engelhard Project for Connecting Life and Learning, a curricular project that integrates reflective dialogue on health and wellness into academic courses, celebrated its 10th anniversary this October.
The project, which is run by the Center for New Designs in Leadership and Scholarship, was created by an initial gift of $250,000 from the Charles Engelhard Foundation. Since the project began in 2005, its professors have implemented it in 328 courses, which have been taken by 9,874 unique students.
The project has also been continually funded by the foundation, receiving a portion of a $3 million grant to the CNDLS in 2010.
The Engelhard Project seeks to foster the values of cura personalis by infusing topics on campus health into course curricula.
Around 20 classes per semester include a component of the project, for which professors receive a stipend to invite guest lecturers and develop wellness-related course content. Professors can apply to CNDLS to implement an Engelhard component each semester.
CNDLS Assistant Director Joselyn Lewis said that while the basic model for implementing Engelhard topics in the classroom has remained consistent over the past 10 years, the acceptance of conversations on health issues in academia has greatly improved.
“The program really has grown and expanded when we started this 10 years ago. … The idea of well-being was thought of as sort of a touchy-feely thing that you didn’t do in relationship to academic content,” Lewis said. “It’s been pretty cool to see, in the last 10 years. … It’s a much more salient and approachable topic.”
Chief of Staff to the Office of the President Joe Ferrara said the project has been valuable in drawing attention to relevant health issues on campus over the past 10 years.
“The Engelhard Project is an extraordinary effort that has significantly deepened our ability to support and care for the well-being of our students,” Ferrara said.
Classes that participate in the Engelhard project include discussions on topics on wellness in relation to the subject of the course.
Philosophy professor Karen Stohr has used the Engelhard project in two of her courses —”Introduction to Ethics” and “Bioethics” — for the past several years.
In her “Introduction to Ethics” course, the Engelhard component includes a discussion on sexual assault with Jen Schweer, the associate director of sexual assault response and prevention services, and a subsequent, ungraded reflection.
“It’s about building a community in which sexual assault is not tolerated,” Stohr said.
In her “Bioethics” course, Stohr chose a discussion on the use of stimulant medications such as Adderall as a form of cognitive enhancement.
“We discuss the ‘high achiever’ environment at Georgetown and the culture that leads students to resort to such practices just to keep up with their lives,” Stohr said.
Stohr said that the Engelhard topics in her classes provided an opportunity for students and faculty to come together and discuss how complex issues of health and wellness are present in the Georgetown community.
“I believe that the study of ethics should affect the way we live, and so I look for Engelhard topics that bear on the experiences of Georgetown students and ethical problems that they face on a routine basis,” Stohr said. “That means that I aim to integrate the mental health issues into the course material as much as I can.”
Lydia Bubniak (SFS ’18), who is taking a course with an Engelhard component, “Environmental Ethics,” said that while she is aware of her course’s implementation of the project, its goals have yet to be fully realized. In her course, Bubniak said that the Engelhard component entailed a viewing of a TED talk on the topic of happiness.
“I haven’t seen that much application of the Engelhard initiative. None of our classmates are really that sure what it’s about. We just kind of know vaguely it’s about wellness,” Bubniak said.
Above all, Lewis said that the Engelhard project has been and will continue to be an important part in fostering discussions that are relevant to students on an individual level.
“I think what we hope is happening is that students are finding ways to connect all the complex and complicated things that are going on in their lives, outside of their coursework,” Lewis said. “The academic content feels more relevant and tied, and that people’s complexities and struggles are sort of being honored and raised up as something more valuable.”
