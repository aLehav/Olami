The fourth floor of Copley Hall, a first-year residential building, flooded following the overflow of a suite toilet, forcing residents to move many of their belongings into a different suite and stay in the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center.
Water from the flood leaked April 15 into the hallway and through the floor into the suite below the affected room, causing damage to a room on the third floor of Copley. Simone Guite (CAS ’26) said she and her two other suitemates were elsewhere in the building when the flood started, but that when they returned to their room, it was flooded. 
“By the time I arrived from the common room, half of my room was flooded,” Guite wrote. “I started taking everything I could off the floor like my power strip, rug, slippers and storage bins with clothes.”
A faulty valve in the toilet caused continuous flushing and overflowing that led to the flood, according to a university spokesperson. 
“When maintenance technicians arrived, they were able to shut the water off to the toilet,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “Plumbers later responded to replace the defective part. Team members also cleaned up water in the impacted rooms.”
Guite said the flooding was not the first time they had issues with the toilet in their suite. 
“We have had toilet issues all semester. The first day of the Spring semester we called facilities because our toilet was leaking,” Guite said. 
Following the flooding, Residential Living followed up with students, the spokesperson said. 
“Residential Living staff followed up with impacted students about their spaces and belongings. Facilities staff worked to clean items that were impacted and return the spaces to the best state possible,” the spokesperson wrote. 
Guite called facilities multiples times about the flood. After the toilet was shut off and the water in Guite’s room vacuumed up, employees from Residential Living asked Guite, her roommate and her suitemates if they could stay in a friend’s room overnight. Residential Living eventually found them rooms in the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center.
The water from the flood in Guite’s room also leaked through the floor and into Charlie Majcher’s (SFS ’26) room on the third floor of Copley Hall.
Majcher said many of his electronics were ruined by the flooding and that he was sitting in his room with his headphones on when he realized that water was seeping through his ceiling April 15.
“I looked over and saw water pouring out of the ceiling all over my bed and all over my guitar,” Majcher wrote to The Hoya. 
“I quickly moved the guitar out of the now waterfall coming from the ceiling but the water had now started coming from every hole in the ceiling. I had a speaker, laptop, DJ deck, Xbox, clothes, TV and pretty much all of my valuables and electronics sitting on my desk when the main light that had filled up with about 30 gallons of water broke, ruining the rest of my possessions,” Majcher added. 
The flood comes after a similar event on the second floor of Copley Hall on Feb. 9, when a toilet handle in a second floor suite snapped. Last year, residents of Copley also complained of flooding, which sparked frustrations among students over university response to the situation. 
Majcher has been living in a hotel room since the flooding occurred. According to Majcher, It took facilities 48 hours to bring the necessary supplies to his dorm to dry up the water, even after he submitted multiple work order submissions. Majcher told The Hoya that the magnitude of this incident was avoidable. 
Two days after the flood, a third-party contractor hired by the university arrived at Guite’s suite to address the water from the flood that had leaked under the walls, into the hallway and into her suitemates’ room.
“This could all have been prevented if Georgetown Facilities had done their job or worked at a pace that would be of any help to students,” Majcher added.

Georgetown graduates Joe Baratta (GSB ’93) and Abigail Baratta (SFS ’96) gave an $11 million gift to the McDonough School of Business (MSB), funding several ongoing initiatives in global business.
The donation includes $5.3 million for the Global Business Fellows Program, which provides interdisciplinary learning opportunities for undergraduate students, and $3.7 million for the Baratta Center for Global Business, a newly launched institute that will consolidate several programs across the university, including the Global Business Fellows program, among others. $2 million will go toward the Baratta International Business Curriculum Endowed Innovation Fund, which will provide four grants annually for faculty and pedagogy, according to an April 11 university statement.
Joe Baratta, the global head of private equity at the investment company Blackstone and a member of the MSB’s Board of Advisors, said he and his wife have worked with the university since 2007 to broaden its presence as a leading institution for globally oriented business.
“The objective of all of this is to make Georgetown the preeminent university for the study of global business at both the undergraduate and graduate level and to attract the best students and professors,” Baratta told The Hoya. “The idea is to ensure that we maintain this position as one of the leading universities in the world and, hopefully, the leading place for students interested in business at the undergraduate level.”
Baratta said he and his wife made their first major gift to the McDonough School of Business in 2016, making a $7.3 million contribution for initiatives furthering scholarships in the international and business realms.
Ricardo Ernst, a Georgetown professor who taught Joe Baratta when he was a student, has served as the Baratta Endowed Chair in Global Business since 2016.
Ernst said Baratta has been highly involved throughout the process of creating and developing initiatives to help the MSB provide students with an interdisciplinary education and problem-solving skills. 
“He’s fully and absolutely committed to all this,” Ernst said. “He’s a true believer in all the things he’s doing, and he’s hands-on. He knows every single detail into what goes on here because we have been working together for the definition of what the Center and the refinement of the Global Business Fellows are all about.”
Ernst and Joe Baratta meet every two weeks to track progress on their programs. For instance, the Global Business Experience program allows both undergraduate and graduate students to travel abroad and meet with executives from multinational organizations and Fortune 500 companies, according to the Baratta Center’s website.
Baratta said he has been satisfied with how Ernst has implemented programs such as the Global Business Fellows program and the Global Business Experience program. 
“They’ve actually been enacting these things that some of us as benefactors of the school believe are important and take advantage of Georgetown’s natural competitive advantages,” Baratta said. “That’s been very gratifying. Specifically, the Global Business Experience program having tangible benefits to students is cool to see.”
The newly launched Baratta Center for Global Business will build on and expand these initiatives, according to Anil Khurana, the Baratta Center’s recently appointed executive director.
“We expect the Baratta Center to be a global convenor of industry, government, and society, focused on a range of high priority issues,” Khurana wrote to The Hoya. “I think it is as an ‘action think tank’ where applied research by Georgetown and MSB faculty and students will help our Baratta Center advisory board members with many of their burning questions.”
Khurana said his priorities include continuing existing global business programs, contributing to research and teaching, presenting at COP28, a United Nations climate change conference, in December, and establishing a visiting fellows program that will benefit student participants.
Ernst said his goals for the new center include creating partnerships with global companies to host internships for students and organizing conferences for students and practitioners. The overall objective of these plans is to provide experiential learning opportunities to students and build on Georgetown’s position as a leader in global business education, according to Ernst.
“We would like this to be the place where everybody goes to understand, calibrate and actually get firsthand information into what’s happening in global business,” Ernst said. “How can we leverage our incredible location in Washington, D.C., to start working with the government on anything that might be dealing with global business — and all that within the tradition of the Jesuit education, which is one of the most important things that most companies appreciate, admire and respect at Georgetown?”
Baratta said his time as a student at Georgetown has greatly shaped his personal and professional life, which is part of why he gives back to the university.
“I’ve had lasting, lifelong friendships and maintain relationships with certain professors who had a profound impact on me over the years, and the environment and culture of Georgetown, I think, was an enabler of my career,” Baratta said.

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate swore in seven newly elected members, presiding officers and committee chairs at its April 16 meeting.
The Senate unanimously reelected incumbent Manahal Fazal (SFS ’24) to serve as speaker and unanimously elected Joshua Bernard-Pearl (SFS ’25), the chair of the Policy and Advocacy Committee (PAC), as the vice speaker. Meriam Ahmad (CAS ’26) and Dylan Davis (CAS ’26) were elected the new chair and vice chair of PAC, while the Senate elected Rhea Iyer (CAS ’26) and Dua Mobin (CAS ’25) chair and vice chair of the Finance and Appropriations Committee (FinApp).
Incumbent FinApp chair John DiPierri (SFS ’25) became the chair of the Senate’s Ethics and Oversight Committee (E&O), which enforces GUSA’s bylaws and ensures that elected GUSA members fulfill their duties, with George Currie (CAS ’26) as E&O vice chair.
The Senate also unanimously verified the results of the April 13-15 elections, during which six juniors and six sophomores standing for election gained Senate seats. In the contested first-year elections, incumbent first-year senators Hilary Orozco (CAS ’26) and Andrew Wong (SFS ’26) lost their current positions. 
GUSA President Camber Vincent (SFS ’24) also swore in new members of the Senate: first-years Ethan Henshaw (CAS ’26) and Yasin Khan (SFS ’26); sophomores Mobin, George LeMieux (CAS ’25) and Noriko O’Shea (SFS ’25); and juniors Jeff Mueller (CAS ’24) and Mason Leath (CAS ’24). 
Ahmad, who ran in a contested internal election for PAC chair against Davis and incumbent PAC vice chair Maria Victoria Almeida Vazquez (SFS ’25), said her record passing policy proved she has the experience needed to chair the committee.
“What I’ve done in the Senate so far has been passing resolutions in support of lowering costs of laundry, passing resolutions for, again, putting more lights in Red Square and to fix the Epi’s kiosks,” Ahmad said at the meeting. “This is really what I’m passionate about, and I want to make sure that GUSA is actually seen as doing something.”
Davis said he aims to further connect the GUSA Senate with the executive and its committees as vice chair of PAC.
“I have a passion to connect the Senate with the executive,” Davis said at the meeting. “I know facilitation, know how to delegate. And I know we’re only as strong as each of our members. So I want to empower everybody. And I want everybody to be working together.”
Iyer defeated Saatvik Sunkavalli (SFS ’25) for the FinApp chair election, while Mobin defeated Mueller and Currie for FinApp vice chair. The Senate will elect the other members of FinApp, the committee that appropriates student activity fee funding between club boards, at its next meeting April 30.
Iyer said her prior experience serving as FinApp’s liaison to the Campus Ministry Student Forum, the advisory board that provides funding to religious student associations, will allow her to effectively lead the committee.
“I’ve learned the ins and outs of FinApp, I’ve learned about advocating for student organizations,” Iyer said at the meeting. “Moving forward, I want to make sure we have a transparent and accountable process.”
Mobin said her experience as the vice president of Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service (GERMS) and a member of the College of Arts and Sciences Dean’s Office taskforce for diversity, equity and inclusion will allow her to fight for equity issues as the vice chair of FinApp.
“I have great potential to continue this work since I’ve already worked with administration on such issues in the past,” Mobin said at the meeting. “So many of the diversity, equity and inclusion issues on campus are financially related.”

Eighteen students won elections to serve as Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) senators, representing the Classes of 2024, 2025 and 2026. 
Members of the student body elected six senators from their respective class years to serve in the GUSA Senate until April 2024 in the April 13-15 election. Twenty students ran campaigns last week — nine first-years, six sophomores and five juniors — with candidates’ messaging focusing on club funding, student housing, inclusivity and institutional transparency.
The junior senators include incumbents Julian Jimenez (CAS ’24), Max Massick (CAS ’24), Megan Skinner (SFS ’24) and Jibril Syed (MSB ’24). Members of the Class of 2024 also elected two new senators, Mason Leath (CAS ’24) and Jeff Mueller (CAS ’24).
Full Disclosure: Mason Leath (CAS ’24) served as Senior Guide Editor during the Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 semesters.
Leath said taking care of Georgetown students’ mental health will be a priority in his first term.
“I think we’re seeing a startling trend of mental health epidemics across the university landscape for young people, and no one should ever feel alone,” Leath wrote to The Hoya. “Moreover, I want everyone at Georgetown to have adequate resources if they are struggling with anxiety or depression because I never want my friends and classmates to feel isolated or scared writ large.”
Jimenez said he plans to focus on small goals that will increase students’ productivity following his reelection.
“I want to prioritize the seemingly little things that affect students on a daily basis that often get overlooked,” Jimenez wrote to The Hoya. “For example, late last semester I started the project to install power strips on Lau 2 because there would often not be enough working outlets for people to use. Someone recently mentioned the HFSC has some outlet issues too, which is why I want to work on that next.”
GUSA also swore in George LeMieux (CAS ’25), Dua Mobin (CAS ’25) and Noriko O’Shea (SFS ’25) to their first senate terms, alongside incumbents Chijioke Achebe (SFS ’25), John DiPierri (SFS ’25) and Saatvik Sunkavalli (SFS ’25).
In the freshman race, students reelected incumbents Meriam Ahmad (CAS ’26), George Currie (CAS ’26), Dylan Davis (CAS ’26) and Rhea Iyer (CAS ’26) to their GUSA Senate seats, with newly elected Ethan Henshaw (CAS ’26) and Yasin Khan (SFS ’26) joining them.
The first-year senators-elect are especially focused on workers’ rights and equity on campus, according to Ahmad.
“There’s a lot of energy among the newly elected senators, particularly the freshman class, to make a difference for workers on campus,” Ahmad wrote to The Hoya. “I’m also planning to continue my efforts to get more lights in Red Square, reduce the cost of laundry, and fix the kiosks at Epi’s to make them representative of what’s actually on the meal plan.”
Ahmad said she plans to increase the student body’s engagement with GUSA particularly through its Finance and Appropriations Committee (FinApp), which allocates money to club advisory boards and held a contentious appropriations process this year.
“I hope to work with the Senate to establish a regular ‘FinApp Debrief’ town hall following each budget summit where anyone can ask FinApp liaisons and adjuncts questions about their decisions to increase transparency and accountability within FinApp,” Ahmad wrote.
As the newly elected FinApp chair, Iyer said she also wants to continue addressing equity issues at Georgetown.
“The most important issues on campus are definitely equity, safety, and facilities,” Iyer wrote to The Hoya. “In this upcoming term, I plan to continue to see the projects I started through to completion. I’ve worked on getting cheaper laundry, having longer SafeRides hours, and instituting regular town halls with GUPD.”
Jimenez said he is proud of GUSA’s accomplishments in the last term, despite student concerns about the organization’s efficacy in previous years.
“People running would present themselves as groundbreaking candidates, and yet most students felt GUSA didn’t actually do anything important,” Jimenez wrote to The Hoya. “This past year, though, I have seen GUSA redeem itself. Members have a strong work ethic and have now embarked on more projects that people tangibly benefit from, most notably the free New York Times and Washington Post subscriptions.”

The Georgetown University community celebrated the life and memory of William “Will” Stocksdale (SFS ’25), who passed away April 5, at the Dahlgren Chapel of the Sacred Heart on April 17. Stocksdale was 20 years old.
Stocksdale grew up in Baltimore and attended Loyola Blakefield, a Catholic prep school in Towson, Md. Stocksdale was the school’s student body president and swam on the school’s swim team.
Stocksdale’s friend Eli Blumenfeld (CAS ’25) remembered his friend as a thoughtful and dedicated individual. 
“He always had a great attention to detail and would oftentimes go the extra mile, just for the sake of being a good friend,” Blumenfeld said at the memorial. “Although I know that Will’s no longer earthly present, we can still try to be friends as well as he was, with as much zeal, with as much loyalty, with as much soul, with as much exuberance as Will carried with him.”
Blumenfeld was Stocksdale’s neighbor in Reynolds Hall and recalled bonding with him over a television show early in their first year.
“Will was one of the most friendly and easy-to-talk-to people I’ve ever met,” Blumenfeld wrote to The Hoya. “One of my first memories with Will was having some drinks and watching Marvel’s ‘What If?’ series.”
“It was really the first night that I can remember having fun at college, and it made me look forward to future experiences not only with Will, but more generally my time here at Georgetown,” Blumenfeld added. 
Lauren Sullivan (CAS ’25), who lived two doors down from Stocksdale last year, said she remembers Stocksdale as one of her first friends on the Hilltop.
“Will was one of the very first people here that I felt comfortable around and that I considered a friend,” Sullivan said at the memorial. “Whenever I think of Will, I think about his thoughtfulness.”
“I remember bonding over small things we had in common, like our love for those Starbucks fall-themed drinks,” Sullivan added. “What I look back on most fondly from the beginning of college is it was the first time that being around people at Georgetown was easy.”
Stocksdale was a global business major. Outside of the classroom, Stocksdale was a mentor for Best Buddies, a nonprofit organization creating friendship, career and mentorship opportunities for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and worked as a lifeguard at Yates Field House. 
William Schlickenmaier (SFS ’01, GRD ’20), an adjunct government lecturer who taught Stocksdale this spring in “Contemporary U.S. Foreign Policy,” said Stocksdale was a thoughtful and passionate student. 
“He would always leave these challenging, trenchant comments that got down to his ethical core and his desire to get beyond realpolitik and take seriously the fundamentals of US foreign policy,” Schlickenmaier wrote to The Hoya. “I always loved seeing that from him.”
“My last memory of Will was perhaps my favorite,” Schlickenmaier added. “He’d been out sick for a while, and had just come back to in-person class for our last meeting before he passed, that Tuesday. I’d shared how happy I was to have him back and he shared as well how happy he was to be back in class.”
History professor Katherine Benton-Cohen, who taught Stocksdale in an introductory history course last spring, said she remembers Stocksdale as a proactive, empathetic and passionate student.
“He was attentive and thoughtful and kind,” Benton-Cohen wrote to The Hoya. “I can remember coming up the lecture steps to chat with him one on one about class materials, teaching him when I visited his section once, and his decision to go above and beyond in his final paper by expanding on an oral history he did with an Afghan refugee.”
Hannah Levine (GRD ’22), who was Stocksdale’s teaching assistant in Benton-Cohen’s class, also spoke on Stocksdale’s kindness and the insightful final paper he wrote for the class.
“I remember feeling moved by his clear passion and empathy,” Levine wrote in a message to Benton-Cohen that was shared with The Hoya. “I know he will be deeply missed.”
Geography professor and School of Foreign Service (SFS) Vice Dean for Undergraduate Affairs Mark Giordano taught Stocksdale in his SFS introductory course “Map of the Modern World,” and said Stocksdale was a model student.
“I am struggling to know what to say,” Giordano wrote to The Hoya. “The reason I am at Georgetown is students like him. I am so sorry he is gone.”
Stocksdale was a committed member to the Students Advancing Food Equity (SAFE), serving as the organization’s vice president and operations director. In those roles, Stocksdale led collaborations with George Washington University’s food pantry and planned sandwich-making events, according to a tribute from the club’s board.
“Will left SAFE a better organization, Georgetown a better community, and anyone that he interacted with, a better person,” the Instagram tribute read. “We will always remember Will for his genuine kindness and empathy. Not only was he a dedicated member of SAFE, Will was also a son, a dear friend, and loved one to many. Our heart goes out to those who were lucky enough to know and love him.” 
Stocksdale is survived by his parents and his brother.

Stuart Weitzman, founder of the luxury shoe company by the same name, explored on April 18 how Georgetown students can take first steps toward building a brand while speaking on his own  entrepreneurial experiences.
The McDonough School of Business (MSB) and the Georgetown Retail and Luxury Association, a student-run organization that creates professional spaces for engagement with high-end industries, hosted the event. It took place as part of the Stanton Distinguished Leaders Series, which connects Georgetown students and alumni with prominent leaders across various industries.
Weitzman’s primary advice for students was to seek out experiential learning opportunities. Weitzman said many of his formative educational experiences occurred outside the classroom.
“The education you get outside sometimes can dwarf what you’re learning inside,” Weitzman said at the event. “Education really will take you from one to 100. There’s no question about that if you do it well. But things like your imagination and experience can take you to infinity.”
Weitzman said preserving a child-like imagination is vital to entrepreneurship.
“We all grow up with a great imagination, and we lose it as we get to school,” Weitzman said. “You don’t want to stand out, you don’t want to take a risk or you don’t want to seem silly. And you begin to not think about some clever ways to do things.”
Weitzman emphasized throughout the event the importance of market opportunities, and said he achieved much of his success through occupying a unique space within the luxury shoe market.
“Find your niche in the market,” Weitzman said. “Understand what you really want to do and how you think you can achieve it. And when you get your mind on that, make sure that whatever product or service you offer, you keep your promise.”
Weitzman said that when choosing business partners, he advises against working with close friends and family members and encourages finding smart and communicative individuals outside of one’s personal social network.
“It’s kind of risky to go in business, to start something with a family member or a best friend. It certainly can work and often does,” Weitzman said. “But when it doesn’t, you lose your partner, you lose your friend or you lose your brother or your sister. So think of that carefully before you decide who you want to do something with. It has more failures than successes.”
Weitzman said he still embraced a certain degree of risk when starting his business — but ensured he had emergency exit routes available in the case of failure.
“I took risks in my business. I saved some money working elsewhere, and I had enough to start a company,” Weitzman said. “There were so many shoes on the shelves, and those companies had been there so long before me that I absolutely had to know what I was doing and find a place for it.”
Weitzman said that once he had envisioned the concept of an innovative luxury shoe, he partnered with several celebrities to launch his brand.
For example, in one of its first marketing campaigns, Weitzman’s company created personalized shoes to match the dresses that women were planning to wear at awards shows. When a celebrity won an award, they would showcase their shoes and thank Stuart Weitzman for designing them.
Weitzman said that creating a visionary and innovative brand was essential to helping his business thrive. The brand draws fashion inspiration from television and movie icons such as Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn, according to Weitzman.
“You don’t want to look necessarily at the competitor next door — you want to look where others might not be looking into your field,” Weitzman said. “And I had no trouble seeing great ideas at other levels of fashion and footwear. Editors and writers of fashion love inspiration. They love to know where an idea came from.”
Weitzman said building a business based on values, rather than rules, is crucial to ensuring long-term success.
“You want to create iconic items. You want to create that because then you own it. You base your branding on values, not on rules, because things change,” Weitzman said. “If you’re stuck with rules, you’ll kind of be frozen to it like a horse with blinkers — you may not want to go where you should.”

Jazz music, local culture and a few blooming flowers are about to hit Union Station, bringing community and energy to this historic train station. 
Titled “Jazz in Bloom,” the project features a series of concerts that will showcase jazz artists from around D.C. Upcoming concerts at Union Station will take place April 26 and April 27, and D.C. has plans to host more throughout the rest of the spring. 
The Office of Cable Television, Film, Music, and Entertainment (OCTFME), a Washington, D.C. governmental organization that supports public radio, television and other media, launched the project as part of the plan of D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) to rejuvenate downtown D.C. 
The series launched April 12 with a performance by Elijah Jamal Balbed, a local jazz saxophonist and winner of the 2020 DCJazzPrix competition.
“Jazz in Bloom” follows other local revitalization projects aimed at rejuvenating downtown D.C., including the Washington Union Station Expansion Project — a $1 million budget increase going toward modernizing Union Station during the 2023 fiscal year — and the Tourism Recovery Tax Emergency Amendment Act of 2022, which increased taxes that D.C. tourists pay to make up for lost revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ramona Yun, a public relations specialist at OCTFME, said this is the first time a local concert series aimed at revitalization is taking place in downtown D.C. The planning process for the concerts began in February 2023, with contributions from OCTFME, the Executive Office of the Mayor (EOM), the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) and a team at Union Station, according to Yun.
Yun said the Union Station host location will make concerts visible to visitors who pass through the area on their way to and from downtown D.C. 
“Jazz in Bloom will re-ignite music displays in what many see as the portal to downtown DC, Union Station and help those visiting to see some of the talent DC has to offer,” Yun wrote to The Hoya.
The goal of “Jazz in Bloom” is to bring more people into the District while also promoting local artists and businesses, according to LaToya Foster, the OCTFME director and D.C. film commissioner.
“We will celebrate our city’s rich cultural heritage while reinvigorating downtown with pop-up concerts, giving music lovers the opportunity to support local businesses and enjoy the city’s vibrant social scene to the tune of the best jazz line-up around,” Foster said in an April 12 press release.
Bowser, who outlined several budget increases related to her revitalization plan during the April 12 “Jazz in Bloom” unveiling, said she aims to draw more people to downtown D.C. with the initiatives.
“Our downtown is the economic engine that allows us to invest in our schools, our safety net, our public safety teams and so much more,” Bowser said in the press release. “We know that the comeback of downtown relies on our ability to bring more people downtown.” 
Bowser’s planned budget increases include raising the Housing in Downtown abatement from $6.8 million to $41 million in the 2028 fiscal year. The plan also supports a $3 million increase in funding for the Great Streets and Small Business Fund, which gives grants to local businesses, and an additional $1.5 million for businesses that take part in Creative and Open Space Modernization (COSM), a tax rebate that seeks to facilitate the creation of businesses in D.C. in the field of technology.
Keith Anderson, the interim deputy mayor for planning and economic development, said he hopes Bowser’s initiatives will help downtown D.C. reach pre-pandemic levels of community engagement.
“Downtown DC is home to 35% of our businesses, employs close to 240,000 workers and generated nearly $1.15 billion in annual revenue pre-pandemic,” Anderson said in the press release. “We know how important our downtown is and we are excited to continue invest in its revitalization, particularly investments in programs like the DC Family Fun Destinations grant that will bring residents and visitors back Downtown.”
“Jazz in Bloom” demonstrates D.C.’s community-centered focus, according to Bowser.
“We have plans and programs to bring more residents downtown, more workers downtown, and more visitors downtown — that includes international and domestic tourists as well as visitors from across DC and around the region,” Bowser said in the press release. “Our plans and investments reflect what we know to be true: people are the lifeblood of DC.”

Two Washington, D.C. government organizations announced a pilot project featuring vending machines that provide safety products like Naloxone (Narcan), an opioid overdose reversal drug, throughout the District that started April 4.
These new machines will also provide access to life-saving fentanyl test strips and hygiene and wellness products, according to the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH), a D.C. government organization that provides prevention, intervention and treatment services, and D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department (FEMS), which administers pre-hospital treatment and rescue services. Family and Medical Counseling Services (FMCS), which provides emotional and physical health care to District families, and Honoring Individual Power and Strength (HIPS), a nonprofit that advocates for communities facing sexual exchange and drug use, received grants from DC Health in October 2021 for the program, according to a DC Health press release. 
Alexander/a Bradley, the outreach and community education manager at HIPS, said that similar harm reduction vending machines (HRVMs) are not a new concept.
“In the United States, there have been HRVMs in Nevada for years now, and other jurisdictions have had naloxone-specific vending machines,” Bradley wrote to The Hoya. “Here in DC, organizations and residents have been advocating for low-barrier services like HRVMs for a while, and DC Health put out a Request for Proposals in 2020 based on the knowledge of the success of other programs and the potential for existing harm reduction programs in DC to succeed with such a program.” 
Bradley said the supplies in the vending machines will be free of charge, and that residents should call the phone number on the HRVM to receive a code they need to enter on the machine for access to products like naloxone or condoms. Items with more restrictions, such as sterile syringes, require a unique code obtained through enrollment in the program.
There are currently six vending machines open 24/7 in various locations around the District where drug overdoses and unhoused populations are present at higher than average rates, according to the press release. 
College students can provide significant support for harm reduction in the greater D.C. community, according to Bradley.
“Being a voice for supporting rather than stigmatizing people who use drugs is critically important,” Bradley wrote. “There are also many public events and advocacy efforts taking place on this issue.”
HIPS is a leader of #DecrimPovertyDC, a grassroots advocacy coalition fighting to decriminalize poverty, which Bradley said college students can continue to support. 
The closest HRVM is about 5 miles from Georgetown University’s campus at 1101 Half St. SW. Lauren Aslami (CAS ’24), the treasurer of Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service (GERMS) and one of its quality assurance officers, said GERMS is equipped to handle overdose in the Georgetown community.
“All of our members are emergency medical technicians carrying national and DC certifications and are trained in managing overdose-related emergencies,” Aslami wrote to The Hoya. “While the treatment for an overdose will depend on a specific patient’s presentation, this can include airway and breathing support and/or the administration of naloxone (also known as Narcan), as indicated.”
Aslami said it is important for students to know that an individual’s condition can decline quickly in situations where drug overdose is happening, and that key symptoms include irregular breathing, pale skin and pinpoint pupils. 
“If you believe someone you are with is in danger of an overdose or exhibiting concerning symptoms, it is always best to call GERMS so they can be assessed and their safety can be ensured, before they get any worse,” Aslami wrote.  
Bradley said the HRVM pilot program will be coming to a close in September 2023 but wants the city to fund more permanent machines. 
“We are hopeful that D.C. Health will consider this an investment worth renewing, especially considering we are really just getting started in terms of the rollout of the fully operational machines,” Bradley wrote.

Washington, D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb announced April 12 that JUUL, an e-cigarette manufacturer, will pay D.C. $15.2 million in a settlement for preying on children and falsely advertising their products to consumers.
D.C.’s lawsuit against JUUL for its dangerous products and targeted advertising to minors follows litigation from many other states, including California, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Mexico and Colorado. In total, these states have obtained $462 million in lawsuit settlements against JUUL.
As a result of the settlement, JUUL is now subject to strict advertising regulations, including a ban from advertising on social media channels, more stringent ID verification and limitations on online and in-person bulk orders, according to a press release from the Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia. 
Attorney General Schwalb, who served as prosecution in the case, said the company used deceptive advertising, such as not disclosing the amount of nicotine content of their e-cigarettes in milligrams, to manipulate vulnerable consumer demographics.
“JUUL knew how addictive and dangerous its products were and actively tried to cover up that medical truth,” Schwalb said in the press release. “The Office of the Attorney General prioritizes protecting District children’s health and safety and ensuring our kids can live healthy, hopeful lives.”
New data suggests vaping, or using e-cigarettes, leads to chronic lung disease, asthma and cardiovascular disease when used alongside cigarettes. Much information about the long-term impacts of vaping have yet to be tested, meaning users are exposed to chemicals with unknown effects.
Despite declines made in smoking rates in youth, e-cigarette usage is increasing dramatically, especially among teens, according to the press release. 3.6 million kids in the United States used e-cigarettes in 2018, including 1 in 5 high school students, according to the FDA and Surgeon General.
The settlement is the largest litigated settlement that the D.C Attorney General has brought against a company. The lawsuits are grounded in the Consumer Protection Procedures Act, which prohibits deceit in business practices. At least 50% of the settlement amount will be used directly to mitigate the public health damages JUUL’s products caused, according to the release.
JUUL had previously paid $438.5 million in a lawsuit with similar concerns on the company’s marketing to underage consumers brought by 33 states and Puerto Rico, which was settled in September 2022. 
Georgetown has maintained a tobacco and smoke-free campus since 2020. This move was in an effort to take greater care of the Georgetown community and emphasize Jesuit values.
Ranit Mishori (MED ’02), chief public health officer at Georgetown, said the outcome of the settlement is a step in the right direction for holding e-cigarette companies accountable.
“It’s an important intervention and a great outcome, but this complex public health issue requires a well-coordinated multi-sectoral approach that includes policy issues related to marketing, advertising, retail, age limits, bans on flavoring, price increases, additional medical and public health research, as well as prevention and education campaigns targeting susceptible groups, among others,” Mishori wrote to The Hoya. 
Studies show that e-cigarette usage leads young people to start smoking conventional cigarettes and other products that contain tobacco, such as cigars and hookahs. Other risks of e-cigarettes include the batteries and devices exploding or catching fire, resulting in serious injuries. 
Mishori said that the risks of vaping are entirely avoidable, which is why lawsuits against their advertisement and distribution are so important. 
“It is up to us to educate ourselves, our family, and our friends, and to actively resist using and promoting these harmful products,” Mishori wrote. “It is also critical to come together to demand policy and regulatory changes and push for accountability for our community at large.”

CW: This article references genocide and antisemitism. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
In recognition of Holocaust Memorial Day, the Jewish Business Alliance and the Jewish Law Student Association collaborated to host a discussion with Eli Rosenbaum, the counselor for war crimes accountability at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).
Holocaust Memorial Day, or Yom HaShoah, is traditionally observed on the 27th day of Nizan on the Hebrew calendar, which falls between April and May on the Gregorian calendar. This year, Yom HaShoah is April 18. The date also falls near the anniversary of the Warsaw ghetto uprising that began April 19, 1943. This uprising was the largest act of Jewish resistance during World War II.
Many commemorate the day by lighting yellow candles in remembrance of victims of the Holocaust, during which the Nazi regime and its allies and collaborators persecuted and murdered over six million Jews. 
The April 11 event, titled “Holocaust Memorial Speaker: Prosecuting War Crimes From Nuremberg to Ukraine,” also featured Georgetown University Law Center professor Jared Silberman who teaches classes on the post-World War II Nuremberg trials.
Rosenbaum is known for his work at the DOJ identifying, denaturalizing and deporting Nazi war criminals following the Holocaust. 
At the event, Rosenbaum said uplifting the stories of survivors is crucial. He shared a segment of poetry written by a survivor of the Holocaust, testimony shared in court by a survivor of a concentration camp and a description of the systematic murders of Jewish children in concentration camps.
Many survivors who Rosenbaum and his DOJ team speak with face an often impossible task of communicating how traumatizing their experiences were.
“You cannot imagine,” Rosenbaum said at the event. “Survivors who have tried to recount for my Justice Department colleagues and for me their hollowing experiences of brutalization at the hands of the Nazis, they don’t have the words to convey the relentless, nightmarish horror of what they made us see and what they did to us.”
Rosenbaum said the international community must remember the history of how the Holocaust unfolded in order to ensure similar tragedies do not happen again, a prospect that is becoming increasingly concerning as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to unfold.
“Jewish people have learned, at the terrible cost of six million lives, that one must not wait until those who harbor ambitions of mass violence and even genocide are able actually to realize their pernicious goals,” Rosenbaum said. “They have to be believed when they speak candidly of their evil goals.”
Rosenbaum now leads the DOJ’s efforts to investigate ongoing war crimes taking place on the global stage, with a specific focus on Ukraine.
“Last June, Attorney General Merrick Garland asked me to take on a new responsibility to lead the Justice Department’s efforts to pursue accountability in the wake of the unlawful full-scale invasion of Ukraine that accused Russian war criminal, Vladimir Putin, launched a year ago,” Rosenbaum said.
“We’ve quickly made some progress in our investigative work, somewhat to my surprise, given the challenges; we have already identified a number of suspects,” Rosenbaum added. 
After months of speculation and pressure from activists, the International Criminal Court at The Hague in the Netherlands issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The warrant, which bears Putin with personal responsibility for the forceful separation of Ukrainian children, marks the first time such an action has been taken against a head of state of one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
Rosenbaum said the DOJ’s preventative work in Ukraine is imperative, as the violence is continuing on the ground.
“The ghastly reality of Russia’s ongoing, widespread and systematic commission of atrocity crimes means that all of us in law enforcement have to do everything we can to pursue justice with all deliberate speed, especially with the intent to deter would-be war crimes,” Rosenbaum said.

Flags flew high and the aroma of delicious cuisine filled the air April 15 as almost 30 different campus organizations celebrated their unique cultures through food and performances at the 2023 Global Expo. 
The International Student Association, an organization that aims to foster community among international students, and Office of Global Services, which aids international Hoyas with visa and immigration-related affairs, co-hosted the event, which featured distinct cultures and ethnic groups from across the globe. Nations and regions represented included Greece, Ukraine, the Caribbean, Eritrea, Palestine, South Asia and France, among many others. 
Alongside serving international dishes, the event showcased dance and music performances from groups like GU Jawani, a bhangra dance team; the Vietnamese Student Association, an affinity group for Vietnamese Hoyas; the Hellenic Association, a community for Greek and Cypriot students; and the Ballet Folklorico Mexicano, a student dance ensemble for traditional Mexican ballet. 
Chris Tengey (CAS ’26), a Ghanaian American who lived in Ghana for several years as a child, said events like the Global Expo are key in engaging in cultural conversations to embrace diversity at Georgetown University.
“You can go to an event and know individuals have similar backgrounds,” Tengey told The Hoya. “You can also learn from other people and how their backgrounds have shaped them.”
Student cultural and religious groups, academic departments and sports teams alike participated in the event at tables displaying a sample of their corner of the world. For instance, the Armenian Student Association (ASA) set up a table and shared Armenian food.
ASA member Armen Asik (SOH ’25) said he appreciates spaces to express campus diversity and demonstrate pride in his Armenian identity.
“Georgetown’s a university that encourages a lot of multiculturalism, and it was good that we were represented even though we’re a small club on campus,” Asik told The Hoya. “There aren’t a lot of Armenians who go to Georgetown, but we’re very proud to be Armenian.”
Lela Tolajian (SFS ’26), another member of the ASA, said the best part of joining the organization is the Armenian community she’s made on campus.
“We do a lot of cultural events,” Tolajian told The Hoya. “We’ve gotten together and had food, and gone to protests together.”
Kyryl Myronenko (SFS ’26), a member of the Ukrainian Society, said he enjoyed sharing his country’s culture at the event.
“Global Expo was nothing but a great time on a Sunny Saturday on the Copley Lawn! At the Ukrainian Society’s table, we had varenyky (traditional dumplings), syrnyky (cheese pancakes), kompot (sweet beverage), Ukrainian candy, and many more,” Myronenko wrote to The Hoya.
Myronenko said food was a key channel for fostering connections and introducing students to Ukrainian culture.
“Through presenting cuisine, all students engaged in intercultural dialogue and were able to share with the student body something important to their identity,” Myronenko wrote. “It was a wonderful opportunity to meet new students and spread the word about Ukrainian culture!”
Tengey said he hopes Georgetown will continue to foster intercultural dialogue to welcome new and existing students, especially those from abroad.
“I think it’s important that Georgetown as an institution creates spaces where people of color feel safe and feel in community, especially if they are coming from parts of the country or other areas of the world where their culture is very unique to them,” Tengey told The Hoya. “So it feels like home to them when they come here and can adapt easier.”

Discussions of Russia and Ukraine have filled political science classrooms across Georgetown University for over a year, but an April 14 conference hoped to shed light on the other problems and opportunities facing Central Asia.
The Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies (CERES), a branch in the School of Foreign Service, organized the one-day conference, entitled “Scenarios of Power in Central Asia.” The event brought together experts for a discussion regarding Central Asia’s role in the war in Ukraine and world affairs. The conference’s first panel, “Pipe Dreams and Energy Scenarios,” discussed the development of limited oil and gas resources, while the second, “Neighbors, Allies and Geopolitical Scenarios,” involved talks regarding trade sanctions, international alliances and other foreign policy issues.
Theresa Sabonis-Helf, a policy expert and professor who chairs the Science, Technology and International Affairs concentration in the School of Foreign Service Master’s degree program, spoke in the first panel.
Sabonis-Helf said she appreciates rising student interest in Central Asia especially given America’s historically low levels of analysis and research into the region.
“I would argue that, except as an appendage to Afghanistan, the level of U.S. interest in the region has never been as high as I think is warranted, but I think there’s a great new generation and it’s very exciting to sort of see that blossoming at Georgetown,” Sabonis-Helf told The Hoya.
Western countries and intergovernmental organizations, including the European Union, have increasingly sought to expand dialogue and diplomatic relations with Central Asian nations as the region grows in influence, in part due to conflicts in Afghanistan and Ukraine. Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, visited the region in March 2023 for meetings with foreign ministers in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Gavin Helf, a CERES adjunct professor and conference speaker, said he feels Central Asian studies have shifted away from a focus that formerly revolved around the Russian Federation.
“Any program in post-Soviet studies used to be a program about Russia, and, incidentally, the other stuff,” Helf said. “I think we’ve seen an evolution away from everything being Russia-centric and looking through the prism of Russia.”
Many of the Central Asian countries, including five of the seven ending in “stan”, were part of the Soviet Union and accordingly are often impacted by and connected to Russia and its foreign policy. Recently, however, western nations as well as China are vying for influence in the region.
Sabonis-Helf said that after living and working in seven countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union, she has a particular appreciation for perspectives gained from the international diversity at Georgetown. 
“I feel like the presence of students from the broader region in Georgetown’s program is really exciting, because they are folks who want to put their own country in context,” Sabonis-Helf said. “I’ve been really impressed with my students from Central Asia or from the Caucasus or from Ukraine.”
Brianne Todd, a professor of practice at the National Defense University and speaker on the second panel, said she enjoyed the event’s focus on power dynamics, many times understated or ignored, in analyses surrounding Central Asia. 
“As several of the speakers highlighted, Central Asia is facing many challenges currently but there are also incredible opportunities,” Todd wrote to The Hoya. “It was refreshing to discuss Central Asia outside of the usual “great power competition” paradigm and to recognize that there are additional power scenarios (and related implications) to be explored.”
Looking beyond the typical focus on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the panel surveyed energy scenarios in Central Asia, an oil-rich region whose trade deals and partnerships have a ripple effect worldwide. Panelists also discussed geopolitics, including diplomatic allyship in a region increasingly subject to foreign influence as Russian leaders devote time and energy to Ukraine.
The great power competition refers to an ongoing contest between large nations like the United States and Russia to establish hegemony, or monopoly on global influence. As technology and trade relationships have evolved over the course of the twenty-first century, foreign policy practitioners view regions like Central Asia as key players in such power competitions.
Todd said students curious about Central Asia should pursue language and other professional opportunities both in the United States and in the region itself, in addition to exploring classes offered on the Hilltop.
“Beyond Georgetown, there are numerous opportunities to engage in language study, field research, and work experience (both remotely and in person) in and/or on Central Asia,” Todd wrote.
Sabonis-Helf said that Georgetown hosting the conference and its experts shows it is an influential institution for the study of Central Asia.
“The fact that Georgetown could round up that group of people shows that it is one of the programs in Washington that’s really doing great Central Asia, and more broadly post-Soviet, kind of work,” Sabonis-Helf said.

Georgetown University graduate student workers and university administrators continued to meet this week after months-long negotiations over demands of the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees (GAGE) for a livable wage.
Since October, students in GAGE, the labor union for graduate student workers, have been in negotiations with university administrators to agree on wages for graduate student workers. GAGE members have called for a roughly $12,000 increase in wage stipends, including an increase from $33,813 to $45,802 for nine-month Ph.D. stipends and $36,934 to $49,466 for 12-month Ph.D. stipends. 
GAGE has sought to engage the student body and graduate workers with tabling events, as well as an April 21 rally in Red Square calling for higher wages.
Representatives for GAGE said that despite ongoing inflation and tuition increases of around 5% in recent years, the university offered a 4% increase to the wages of graduate student workers, which fell roughly $10,000 short of GAGE’s demand per worker. Prior to this, the university originally offered a 2.5% increase but after negotiations, offered an additional 0.5% increase. As negotiations progressed, GAGE negotiators told The Hoya that university negotiators raised that number by another 1%.
Dominick Cooper, a rising fourth-year doctoral student and the president of GAGE, said he believes the university’s proposals are inadequate in their current iterations.
“In our current inflationary environment, these proposals are, functionally speaking, proposals for grad student workers to take pay cuts,” Cooper wrote to The Hoya. “This is not a contract that will come close to meeting the needs of GAGE members, and it is not a contract that GAGE members deserve.”
On April 17, GAGE negotiators said a university offer included an hourly rate of $21.10 for hourly workers as well as $35,167 for nine-month doctoral candidates and $38,411 for 12-month doctoral candidates. A single adult in Washington, D.C., must earn $46,082 before taxes to meet the threshold for a livable wage, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Living Wage Calculator.
The calculator uses economic measurements that account for geographic differences, as well as a wider range of basic expenses, including health care, which GAGE members receive through their university contracts.
GAGE workers have especially expressed frustration over the university’s decision to spend $11 million to buy out former men’s basketball Head Coach Patrick Ewing (CAS ’85), while offering to spend fewer than $200 per student on stipend increases for graduate student workers, according to a GAGE tweet.
“We value our graduate students and their contributions to the Georgetown community and are committed to ensuring they are supported during their academic formation at Georgetown,” a university spokesperson wrote to The Hoya.
GAGE representatives said that among Georgetown University’s 10 self-selected peer institutions, none of which are in the region and five of which are members of the Ivy League, Georgetown ranks last in graduate student wages based on the MIT wage calculator.
Doctoral candidates at Georgetown receive full tuition, dental insurance and health coverage, as well as the highest stipend in the D.C. area for part-time work over nine or 12 months, depending on their program, according to a university spokesperson.
“Converting 9-month and 12-month stipends from 15 hours to 40 hours would produce full-time equivalents of at least $90,000 and $98,000, respectively,” a university spokesperson wrote.
Sidhant Saraogi, a rising third-year doctoral student and GAGE’s lead organizer for natural and biomedical sciences, said graduate student working hours often exceed their 15-hour-a-week contractual obligations.
“It is no secret that our members work much more than what is expected from us in our contract,” Saraogi wrote to The Hoya.
Beyond acting as teaching and research assistants, graduate students are encouraged to conduct research and attend conferences, but often, they need to take other paid jobs, according to a tweet by a GAGE member.
This is not the first time GAGE and university administrators have been locked in negotiations. In 2020, they negotiated over health and economic protections that resulted in arbitration proceedings.
So far, Cooper said GAGE has made progress in its negotiations with the university in terms of noneconomic terms, and each side said they hope to continue working toward an agreement.
“Our negotiations with the GU administration began in October of last year, and we’ve made some good progress so far on many non-economic aspects of our contract, particularly on elements of the contract focused on immigration processing for international students, protection for undocumented workers, and stronger language on union security,” Cooper wrote.

CW: This article discusses clerical sexual assault. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Former Washington, D.C. Archbishop and Georgetown University honorary degree recipient Theodore McCarrick, 92, is facing his second criminal case for the sexual assault of a teenage boy in 1977.
Wisconsin prosecutors charged McCarrick on April 17 with one count of fourth-degree sexual assault over accusations that he fondled an 18-year-old man without his consent at a residence in Lake Geneva, Wis., in 1977. The incident is allegedly just one instance of McCarrick’s repeated sexual abuse of the survivor — to whom the archbishop was a family friend — that began when the survivor was 11 years old, according to a Vatican report on the ex-cardinal. 
McCarrick is the first cardinal in the United States to be criminally charged with a sexual offense against a minor and is the highest-ranking clerical official to be removed from the priesthood over sexual misconduct. After a 2019 church investigation found him guilty of sexually abusing minors and adult seminaries, Pope Francis expelled McCarrick from the priesthood.
Georgetown awarded McCarrick an honorary degree in December 2004 for his humanitarian work as archbishop of Washington, D.C. McCarrick also engaged with the university through events, including an August 2009 discussion with students on global development and peacemaking efforts. 
The university later revoked the distinction in light of the allegations against McCarrick, marking the first time in history that Georgetown rescinded an honorary degree, according to a university spokesperson.
“In 2019 Georgetown announced its decision to rescind the honorary degree granted to Theodore McCarrick in 2004 after the Vatican concluded its investigation and dismissed him from the priesthood,” a university spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. 
Though honorary degrees are awarded for life, Georgetown retains the right to rescind the recognition if an individual fails to uphold its values of advancing the common good, according to university policy that the spokesperson shared with The Hoya. 
“Awardees reflect the values and personify the mission of the University,” the policy reads. “If at any time during the life of an awardee the University becomes aware of documented evidence of criminal, unethical or immoral behavior or activity, the University has the right to rescind the honorary degree.”
The survivor in the April 17 charges also filed a complaint in 2021, after which Massachusetts prosecutors charged McCarrick with three counts of indecent assault and battery for molesting the then-16-year-old survivor at a wedding reception in 1974. McCarrick’s attorneys filed for dismissal, arguing that McCarrick’s age makes him mentally incompetent for trial, although prosecutors are still working to disprove this claim.
Statutes of limitations — laws that dictate the maximum amount of time that can pass after an event before legal parties can no longer press charges — have prevented several survivors from filing civil lawsuits against McCarrick for assaults said to have occurred between the 1970s and 1990s. However, the survivor in these criminal cases was neither a resident of Wisconsin nor Massachusetts and left the states after the assaults allegedly occurred, a technicality that put a hold on the expiration of the legal window. 
An estimated 14 minors and at least eight seminarians, priests and other vulnerable U.S. adults have accused McCarrick of sexual abuse, according to BishopAccountability.org. Their stories follow a greater trend in recent years of sexual abuse allegations rising dramatically within the Catholic Church.
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said he supports individuals who hold church officials accountable by reporting these abuses of power, especially given the backlash and doubt that survivors often receive.       
  “Thank you to the brave survivors who have made reports through the clergy and faith leader abuse initiative,” Kaul said in an April 17 press release. “I encourage other survivors who have not yet reported to consider speaking to the victim services specialist at DOJ who is dedicated to this initiative and to make a report.”
