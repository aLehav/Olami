EdX, the consortium of universities, including Georgetown, that offers Massive Open Online Courses for free, introduced experimental software last week that uses artificial intelligence to grade and provide feedback on essays.
“The goal of edX’s open-ended assessment tool kit is to help students learn through relevant feedback systems,” edX Director of Communications Nancy Moss wrote in an email. “While often the preferred way to help students learn is to have one-on-one or small group interaction with a faculty member, this is not always possible in a MOOC or classroom environment.”
Moss said that software was still in the pilot phase and added that the technology is not intended to replace the role of an instructor but rather to help teachers handle the workload of a MOOC, which can include thousands of students and assist them in their other roles.
Moss added that she believes that students in MOOCs will benefit from this instant feedback, since they will not have to wait for hundreds of submissions to be graded individually by a human.
“Open-ended AI assessment is less about grading a paper or answer and more about offering ways to generate feedback for students in an accelerated way,” Moss wrote. “The current technology provides ongoing, real-time feedback to students, allowing learners to iteratively improve their answers, with the help of an instructor-defined rubric.”
English professor John Glavin said the technology could be used to help students understand the basics of a given subject before moving on to more complex topics.
“A lot of what I spend my time doing could be better done if I were to create a MOOC in which I would say, ‘Here is a very basic dramatic structure and here’s how it works. Did you get it? If not, let’s go back and do it again,’” Glavin said. “I’d love to have all of that taken off my back so I could spend more of the time reading and critiquing individual submissions.”
He added that the essay-grading software would allow students to revise and resubmit their work until they get the basics right, freeing him to focus on grading the advanced work and final product.
Glavin also noted that technology can make the classroom and learning process more comfortable and accessible but warned that tools such as essay-grading software have their limits, especially when evaluating more technical or specific essays.
“The key is to really decide which subjects and which skills are really suited to this kind of training and which aren’t,” Glavin said.
Other professors were less ready to consider using computers to grade submissions. Government professor Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., said that he is skeptical of a machine’s ability to evaluate the complexities of an essay.
“I have major reservations about this. I think there’s something to really understanding an essay that computers just can’t copy,” he said. “The computer can’t capture all the subtleties. Even with rubrics, they can’t capture all of the pieces.”
Classics professor Douglas Boin (COL ’99) said that though he frequently uses technology in the classroom, he prefers to personally interact with students in grading.
“I’m a big fan of using technology in the classroom,” Boin said. “But in terms of handing over the power to a computer to do grading, I’m not ready to do that yet simply because I have my own high quality-control standards already in class. I think many professors might feel that way.”
Boin noted that technology should be focused on creating the best learning environment on campus before branching out and that schools would succeed online only when they had streamlined their existing technological resources.
“I think there’s a lot of in-house technology building that has to be done before we start outsourcing large lecture classes, things like linking grades on Blackboard to the registrar or to MyAccess,” Boinsaid.
Boin also said that schools should focus on tools like the Corp’s Classy, a class registration system released April 2, before moving to online learning models. Initiatives like edX, according to Boin, work best when they complement a strong technological infrastructure.
“One is window-dressing and the other one is much more long-term that must be done,” he said.

The GUSA senate voted unanimously Sunday to require annual sexual assault peer educator training for all student government members, while also urging the university to alter its policy regarding sexual assault in the Code of Student Conduct.
These bills come at the heels of months of work by the Georgetown University Student Association Sexual Assault Working Group to add an hour-long sexual assault training and discussion program for all students to New Student Orientation. That effort culminated in the addition of sexual assault resources as a topic addressed in the NSO Show and a voluntary ice cream social as a forum for discussion of the issue.
The second resolution called for the addition of an amnesty clause to the code of conduct protecting those wishing to report sexual assault cases from other violations, including underage alcohol use, drug use, noise violations and trespassing.
“Right now, students do not have amnesty for reporting issues of sexual assault. If there are drugs or alcohol on them, that is something that can count against them,” said GUSA senator Patrick Spagnuolo (SFS ’14), a co-sponsor of both bills.
The second bill also encourages the university administration to more clearly define sexual consent in the code and to delineate the difference between sexual assault, a Category C violation according to the code of conduct, and sexual misconduct, a Category B violation. GUSA also called for better publicity of the reporting process for cases of sexual assault.
Meanwhile, the senate rejected an amendment proposed by GUSA Senator Ben Weiss (COL ’15) that would have required all members of advisory boards that receive funding from the student activities fee endowment through the GUSA Finance and Appropriate Committee to undergo similar training in a vote of 5-15.
“Because we are GUSA, we can mandate ourselves, but we also have power over the advisory boards,” Weiss said.
Spagnuolo disagreed with Weiss, noting the discrepancy between controlling advisory board funding and mandating particular advisory board behavior over topics unrelated to budgetary issues.
Newly appointed Finance and Appropriations Chair Cannon Warren (SFS ’14) echoed Spagnuolo’sremarks and remained critical of mandating sexual assault training as an additional prerequisite to the current requirements advisory boards must meet to apply for funding.
“Strategically, we already have a tense relationship with advisory boards,” Warren said. “I think we can ask them first.  If you haven’t talked to them yet, this might hit them in the face.”
GUSA senator Robert Shepherd (COL ’15), who supports Weiss’ proposal in principle, agreed with Warren on the need for communication with the advisory boards.
“I fully agree that advisory boards should be required to do it, but I don’t think we’re logistically ready to do it at this point,” Shepherd said.
Weiss objected to these arguments.
“This training is a one-hour conversation about sexual assault. Advisory boards meet once a week, every week, for the year. If they don’t have an hour to spare to learn about one of the most horrific things that can be done to a person, I don’t know what you have time for,” he said.
GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), who worked closely with the GUSA senate to develop the two successful bills, emphasized the importance of making sexual assault a central discussion between the university administration and students.
“The problem with the administration is that they are passive and they don’t fight against the barriers,”Tisa said. “Over the summer, I knew someone who was assaulted on this campus. The response they received from the university and from people who were involved was to sweep it under the rug.  These are things that we have to change culturally and in terms of policy.”

While students in the School of Foreign Service have the shared experience of preparing for language proficiency exams, the nature of the exams varies vastly from one language to another.
The SFS worked with language departments last year to standardize the goals and standards of proficiency exams to ensure students have grasped grammar, vocabulary and cultural understanding, according to SFS Associate Dean Emily Zenick, who oversees proficiency exams across departments.
“[Language tests] gauge two things. We care that the grammar’s right, that the vocabulary’s right and that students can understand the questions being asked of them and respond. So the linguistic competency is an important part,” Zenick said. “But the other part is the idea of cultural literacy.”Zenick explained that it’s not just a question of “Are you answering the question grammatically correctly?” but rather, “Do you have an understanding of the context in which the language is used?’”
The SFS describes a “pass” on the proficiency exams as comparable to achieving an intermediate-high to advanced-mid standing on the American Council for the Teaching of Foreign Languages guidelines, or a B1/low B2 in the Common European Framework of Reference.
But departments are largely left on their own to administer the exams, and many discrepancies persist, according to students and faculty interviewed for this article.
Professors acknowledged that communication between departments regarding proficiency exams is minimal.
“We have not had much contact recently,” Interim Chair of the French Department Deborah LeskoBaker said. “I think that departments are in general agreement about what it takes to pass the exam, but we do not regularly communicate with all other departments about what their specific levels of preparation are.”
Italian professor Anna de Fina, who coordinates the Italian proficiency exams, said she would like to see more coordination among departments, though complete coordination would be difficult and undesirable.
“I don’t feel that there is a complete coordination among the different departments,’” De Fina said.  “On the other hand, I don’t know whether you can ask every department to have the same because departments have different traditions of teaching, different standardized tests that they rely on, I don’t know to what extent you could make the case for having exactly the same level, or the same kind of exam even.”
In most departments, students speak for 20 minutes with two professors about an article they read before the exam and are asked to summarize the main idea, give their opinion and answer questions posed by the test proctor. Students also answer questions on more familiar topics, such as their personal and family lives. However, these guidelines are far from universal across departments.
Students who take proficiency exams in Italian do not have to read an article, while students who take the Chinese exam are given three hours to do so, in contrast to only 20 hours for those taking the Spanish exam. Students in the German department prepare a five-minute presentation on German current events, along with a discussion of an article.
Students suggested that languages typically thought to be harder for English speakers to learn, such as Chinese and Arabic, have less demanding exams.
Yomna Sarhan (SFS ’14), who passed both the Arabic and French proficiency exams, said the French exam was significantly more challenging.
“In the Arabic one, I was asked about my family, my hobbies and my favorite classes. It was much more conversational, while the French one was strictly about the assigned article and French domestic policy,” she said. “It seems that since Arabic is a harder language, the proficiency exam is less rigorous — the goal is just to get you to talk about yourself and your life. The French one, I found, was much more difficult and demanding.”
Juman Khweis (SFS ’13), who grew up speaking Palestinian Arabic and studied modern standard Arabic for three years at Georgetown, said she was surprised by the format of the language’s exam.
“They don’t test your writing skills and they ask you pretty basic questions about the article. My overall impression was that they just asked pretty simple questions so if you just remembered the vocabulary from your first semester of Arabic you would do a good job,” she said.
Rui Hao Puah (SFS ’16), who learned Chinese as part of his bilingual education in Singapore, said the Chinese proficiency exam was also fairly basic.
“The proficiency test is too easy,” he said. “Even after passing the test I don’t feel comfortable living in China and working there. I don’t feel proficient at all.”
For those who study more common European languages, the proficiency exam is a different experience.
“The French proficiency exam, at least, ensures that you are able to function in higher-level academic discussion and analysis of current events,” Allie Van Dine (SFS ’14), who passed her French exam, said. “I would say that it was a great measurement of my language skills, because it not only combined my ability to speak and read, but also analyze within the language and employ traditionally French frameworks for that analysis.”
Exams may also vary within departments, depending on instructors and subject discussed in assigned articles.
“It’s different teachers, it’s not the same and the passages are different. Every test has a different passage,” Puah said. “It depends on the teacher. You might get a lenient teacher, but generally the standards are the same.”

Faculty, students and ambassadors will mingle in style at the 88th annual Diplomatic Ball tonight.
The event, held in the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium near the National Mall, will honor the Mellon auditorium’s claim to fame as the site of the signing of the North American Trade Organization defense pact in 1949 with its theme, “Strength in Unity.”
According to Diplomatic Ball Planning Committee Co-Chair Alex Pommier (SFS ’15), a record 950 guests will don ball gowns and tuxedos for this year’s event. Among the diplomatic guests are representatives from 43 embassies, including 30 ambassadors, including Egyptian Ambassador Mohamed M. Tawfik, Argentinean Ambassador CeciliaNahón and Italian Ambassador Claudio Bisogniero,
This year marks the first time Walsh School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster, who will deliver welcoming remarks, will attend.
“We’re really excited,” planning committee member Steffany Arzate (SFS ’15) said. “A lot of ambassadors ask about her.”
The 10 students that comprise the planning committee have had the venue and other logistics set since the beginning of the fall semester, with the help of the SFS Academic Council and BSFSProgram Special Assistant Ben Zimmerman. The prominent guest list means the event requires extensive security, including identification checks for all attendees, provided by the university.
Through fundraising, the committee was able to provide free tickets to student performers, contest winners and faculty members whose work is particularly relevant, like former ambassadors and current professors Touqir Hussain and Donald McHenry, both of whom attend this year.
“There are always [faculty] that kind of fit the theme, like former ambassadors or people who have had some connection to the State Department,” Arzate said.
Invitations are also extended to alumni and professors who have attended in the past.
Visiting associate professor of Arabic and two-time attendee Terrence Potter will once again attend this year.
“I enjoy the company of students — talented, energetic, optimistic and intelligent people, who seek to be dedicated professionals in the future,” Potter said.
Potter stressed the value of Dip Ball not only to students, but also to faculty members.
“Faculty can gain an appreciation for where students are coming from, including what preconceived notions they have, what expectations they have and how they will be fitting in,” Potter said. “Of course, faculty can learn how difficult it may be to convey the reality of what service entails.”
Arzate emphasized that Dip Ball is not limited to those affiliated with the SFS.
“When I sell tickets, I always find a lot of kids from the College go, a lot of the kids from the SFS go,”Arzate said. “It’s one of the biggest myths that it’s an SFS-only event.”
This year, 41.8 percent of student tickets were purchased by SFS students, while 40.4 percent were to students in the College. The remaining 13 percent of student tickets are distributed between both undergraduates from the McDonough School of Business and the School of Nursing and Health Sciences as well as graduate students. .
Most student attendees are freshmen and seniors, who make up 36.3 and 37.2 percent of student attendees, respectively.
Michael Fischer (SFS ’13), who has attended each year, stressed the significance of the event.
“The opportunity to meet classmates, diplomats, and faculty in an exciting and unusual context is what keeps bringing me back,” Fischer said. “Whether it be learning about the upcoming SFS Centennial to hearing interesting behind-the-scenes tales of diplomatic endeavors, guests at [the ball] are always excited to be there and readily accessible for passionate conversation.”
The program will include a performance by Georgetown Jazz, a presentation by the SFS Faculty of the Year award and performances from Georgetown Superfood and the Georgetown Ballroom Dance Team.

The George Washington University has been in uproar about the role of religion on campus after two seniors launched a campaign to remove a Catholic priest for his anti-gay and anti-abortion views earlier this week.
Fr. Greg Shaffer, the head chaplain of the Newman Center, a GWU-affiliated Catholic center, has been criticized for his anti-gay and anti-abortion stance, which a group of at least 12 students — including Damian Legacy and Blake Bergen, who began the movement — have found to be alienating.
In particular, some have taken issue with Shaffer’scounselling sessions in which he allegedly advised students attracted to those of the same sex to live celibate lives, according to The GW Hatchet.
Additionally, Shaffer has taken heat for calling gay relationships “unnatural and immoral” in a blog post last May.
The Newman Center houses the on-campus Catholic group, GW Catholics, and receives funding from the university’s student association, which Legacy and Bergen are seeking to have reduced. However, the center’s priests are appointed by the Archdiocese of Washington and the center itself is part of the Roman Catholic Church.
The archdiocese issued a statement affirming Scaffer’s doctrine as consistent with that of the Catholic Church April 5.
“Fr. Greg Shaffer, chaplain at the Newman Center on the campus of the George Washington University, shares the teachings of the Catholic Church in a welcoming and joyful manner,” the statement read. “His ministry is a vital component of the vibrant faith community on campus.”
The archdiocese also noted that the Catholic Church’s doctrine does not necessarily have to be aligned with popular opinion.
“Despite the current cultural beliefs about homosexuality, the teaching of the Catholic Church remains unchanged,” it said. “Priests have a commitment to educate people in the truths of our faith, regardless of cultural trend.”
Georgetown theology professor Fr. Stephen Fields, S.J., agreed that Shaffer’s rhetoric is representative of the views of the Catholic Church.
“His job, it seems to me, is twofold. First and foremost, it is to educate people about the teaching of the church on sexuality. It’s very simple: We believe that sexual relations should be between a man and woman in a marriage that has been blessed by God. [Schaffer] has a moral responsible to teach that,” Fields said. “His second obligation is to offer pastoral care, to offer charity and love to absolutely everyone.”
Maria Wilhoit, a sophomore at GWU unaffiliated with the Newman Center, does not believe the students’ concerns to be widespread enough to warrant Shaffer’s removal.
“I find that these two men’s complaints are still too isolated and singular to give real weight to removing Father Shaffer,” Wilhoit said.
Wilhoit also believes that the complaint should ultimately be resolved by the Catholic Church, notGWU.
“Ultimately, I think the final decision should rest with the Archdiocese of D.C., not [GWU],” Wilhoit said. “[GWU], if it feels the need to act, could address a more formal complaint to the archdiocese.”
Chris Cannataro (MSB ’15) a deputy grand knight with the Georgetown chapter of the Order of the Knights of Columbus who has been in conversation with Catholic colleagues at GWU, says the events have raised uncomfortable questions about the place of religion on that campus.
“We all feel that this might lead to a bad precedent for intellectual and academic freedom,” Cannatarosaid. “Priests have the right to teach the faith, and it may not be popular, but it’s what they’re called to do.”
Ian Campbell (SFS ’15), a member of the Georgetown Secular Student Association, does not see a clear-cut solution to the issue.
“I think anywhere [GWU administrators] go, they’re walking the line between censorship with respecting their students need for a spiritual life and making sure that everyone that attends GWUfeels included,” Campbell said.
Campbell supports the free speech granted to Shaffer, even though he disagrees with his views.
“His speech is legal, even if it is offensive, and while I don’t personally support it, that is the Catholic doctrine,” Campbell said.
Fields added that he believes the role of a Catholic priest is the same on a secular campus as it is on a religious campus like Georgetown and that Shaffer should not back away from expressing his personal views.
“I think the teachings of the moral church can’t be compromised no matter where they’re taught, whether it’s at Georgetown or on the campus of George Washington,” Fields said.
Nonetheless, Wilhoit believes that the unfolding of events reflects the larger issues endemic to Catholic doctrine.
“What [Legacy and Bergen] are showing, I think on a bigger level, is the rhetoric still in the Catholic Church that, intentional or not, ostracizes gay people from the community,” Wilhoit said.

NextGUTS, a new feature on the Georgetown mobile application that tracks Georgetown University Transportation Service buses, is set to debut April 15.
The service will offer real-time updates and GPS locations for all GUTS buses, which include recently introduced late-night shuttles to and from Adams Morgan and Dupont Circle. NextGUTS was designed by University Facilities and University Information Services.
Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said that the idea was conceived based on input from focus groups, surveys and Georgetown residents. According to Morey, the app will allow users to maximize their time and plan commutes with greater accuracy.
To calculate bus arrival times, the app uses historic data of GUTS routes from November 2012 onward, accounting for traffic, red lights and rush-hour trends. Unusual situations like motorcades and bridge closings are expected to add to the margin of error, but Mobile Program Manager Lee Emmertexpects the application’s accuracy is expected to improve over time.
Morey said that NextGUTS will help the university to ensure that buses run on the correct routes and adhere to revised routes designed to avoid residential neighborhoods when possible.
Deputy Chief Information Officer Judd Nicholson said that the popularity of the transit feature on the Georgetown mobile app, launched last year, was a driving factor in the creation of NextGUTS.
Emmert expects that NextGUTS would attract more users to the mobile app, which now has more than 10,000 users across its platforms. Emmert stressed the importance of the app and said the university would continue seeking feedback.
Students have already expressed interested in the new feature, including Bo Julie Crowley (COL ’15).
“I take GUTS now for my internship, and buses come infrequently to the Rosslyn station since there’s traffic on the Key Bridge,” Crowley said. “It’d be nice to know if there’s a wait or if I should hurry up to catch the next one.”

What began in 2003 as a small gathering for School of Nursing and Health Studies students to present their research has grown to include research presentations from a variety of Georgetown students and students from other local universities.
The Undergraduate Research Conference, held in Copley Formal Lounge on Wednesday, expanded significantly this year, with 82 poster presentations instead of the usual 50.
The conference is organized by the Student Planning Committee, which comprises six students — four from the NHS and two from the College. They encourage students to submit research beyond the basic sciences.
“Stereotypically, when you think of research, you think about pipettes in a lab, but what we’re seeing is that there’s something that’s going more towards literature reviews, public health and policy topics,” Co-Chair Faith Svigos (NHS ’14) said.
The conference’s faculty advisor, Alex Theos, who teaches in the department of human science, said that the conference is a unique chance for students who work on extensive research projects outside of class to present their work.
“That’s really the focus of the day: the opportunity for these students who’ve been involved in independent research to present to their peers,” he said. “It’s really good practice because quite a lot of these students will, I’m sure, eventually go on, even while they’re undergraduates, to national, international meetings.”
Student Planning Committee member Colin Ryan (NHS ’13) said that research at the conference covers extremely diverse topics within the science field.
“The whole point of it is to have a health sciences research symposium so anything that’s related to health science, whether it be mathematics, health policy, global health, biology or chemistry,” he said. “Basically anything that undergraduates participated in their lab, they’re able to present at our conference, which is a pretty unique opportunity in the area”
After students presented their posters and were judged by faculty volunteers, the Student Planning Committee chose three researchers to give oral presentations on their work to the whole conference.
According to Theos, there is a growing number of female students participating in the annual conference. Seventy-one percent of this year’s presenters were women.
In addition to the female students, this year’s keynote speaker was Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Carolyn Clancy. Biology professor Heidi Elmendorf received the Allan Angerio Award for Excellence in Faculty Mentorship, which is given out annually at the conference.
“There’s a theme here. Heidi’s winning the Allen Angerio Award and the three abstracts that were selected for oral presentations are all female scientists,” Theos said. “And our speaker is a female, a very qualified, distinguished, female scientist.”
Ryan hopes that the ever-increasing number of students who want to present their work indicates that more undergraduates are pursuing research outside the classroom.
“It was great to see how many people just came out and said ‘I want to present my research and get it out there,’ which is really encouraging for our campus, as well as for all the other D.C. area campuses, for undergraduate research,” Ryan said. “It shows that the faculty members are getting engaged with the students and the students are trying to get engaged with what the faculty are interested in. There’s definitely a reciprocal relationship there.”

Three months after the installation and activation of solar panels on six university-owned townhouses, Gary Guzy, deputy director and general counsel for the White House Council on Environmental Equality, lauded the university’s innovative approach at the project’s ceremonial launch Thursday.
The project, SolarStreet, aligns with University President John J. DeGioia’s pledge to cut Georgetown’s greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2020. The solar panels on the37th Street townhouses also make Georgetown the fourth-largest user of green power among U.S. colleges.
“Georgetown is becoming a model for how universities across the country are seeing clean energy,”Guzy said at the ceremony. “How you’re recognizing that sustainability can enhance the quality of community life. How it can save money, how it can be consistent with the university’s educational and research mission, how promoting innovation, promoting healthy communities and campuses are things that come together and are of tremendous import. … This is really an enormously impressive accomplishment of which the university and the university community should be tremendously proud.”
The rooftop systems will collectively produce nearly 20,000 kilowatts of electricity each year, equal to roughly 27 percent of the electricity currently used in the six residences.
Dan Mathis (SFS ’13), project manager of Georgetown Energy, a student group that collaborated with the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund and the university administration to get the solar panels up and running, stressed the project’s direct impact on fostering sustainability at Georgetown, as well as the precedent it set for strong partnerships between student groups and administrators.
“By working together and constantly pushing each other, every member of this project, student or administrator, ensured the success of the Solar Street,” Mathis said. “I think this is evident in the large number of green projects from students and being considered by administrators since this project started.”
Mathis cited piezoelectric tiles in O’Donovan Hall, divestment of the university’s fossil fuel holdings and a community garden and composting as examples of initiatives administrators are considering or have already implemented.
Georgetown Energy originally proposed installing solar panels on 43 south-facing townhouses, which was budgeted $250,000 from the 2010 Student Activities Fee Endowment reform. The project only used $50,000 to install solar panels because only six townhouses have roofs capable of supporting solar energy equipment.
The remaining $200,000 will go to the Georgetown Green Fund under the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, which provides funding for projects promoting sustainability.
GUSA’s former Director of Students Activities Fee and Endowment Implementation Colton Malkerson(COL ’13) said that although townhouse residents will continue to pay a flat rate for utilities, energy savings will roll back to the Georgetown University Student Association. The student association’s Finance and Appropriation Committee will have the discretion to allocate the funds to various advisory boards during next year’s budget summit, a structure Guzy regards as a model for environmental savings.
“You’ve heard these amazing statistics about the equivalent number of cars being taken off the road,”Guzy said, “about the dollars saving to the university ultimately and to its students about how that frees up other resources to do other important and great things at the university, about the importance of cutting greenhouse gases as the world grapples with the challenges of climate change. Solar Street is a great example of common purposes and the Obama administration is really proud to stand with you as you make these important investments.”
Malkerson also expressed optimism that the project marked the beginning of more green initiatives to come.
“Today, you saw a multi-year student project come to a full circle and a big success,” Malkerson said. “It’s a very small project, and it’s a down payment, but I think it just shows how Georgetown can continue to implement solar and energy efficient technology, and this serves as the down payment and starting point on further projects.”

A group of nearly 200 Georgetown students marched in Wednesday’s 90-degree heat from the Hilltop to Capitol Hill, joining a crowd of thousands in a rally for immigration reform.
The Georgetown University Immigration Coalition, an umbrella organization that works with student groups including Hoyas for Immigrant Rights, the Asian American Student Association, MEChA and GU Pride, organized a Georgetown contingency to join the rally.
The rally was organized as a precursor to a comprehensive immigration reform bill that is expected to be introduced in Congress next week. The event was sponsored by several organizations, including the Center for Community Change, Service Employees International Union and United Auto Workers.
“[We] are coming together to show Congress they need to get moving on a bill for comprehensive immigrant reform,” Donna De La Cruz, press secretary for the Center for Community Change, said.
Christina Gil (COL ’13), public relations coordinator for Hoyas for Immigrant Rights, called attention to the diverse support for immigration reform.
“It’s been portrayed as [just] a Latino issue, and it’s really not,” Gil said.
Shaiesha Donnelly (SFS ’15), — a rally organizer — agreed, pointing to the diverse crowd of students that turned out Wednesday.
“To have representatives for Georgetown march shows everyone how diverse we are and shows how support for immigration reform isn’t limited to the groups it’s been associated with in the past,” Donnelly said. “Georgetown made a big difference today.”
Approximately 100 Georgetown students began marching from the Healy Gates and were gradually joined by more students and members of the larger Georgetown community on their way to the Capitol.
“I think it was a huge success,” Lisa Frank (COL ’13) said. “More and more people kept joining our group. Just being able to walk down with a great group of people who had a lot of energy … was pretty cool. It’s great that we have the ability to go and do things like this.”
A major focus of the demonstration was the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, a legislative proposal from Sen. Dick Durbin (SFS ’66, LAW ’69), a Democrat from Illinois, and Sen.Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) that would provide conditional permanent residency to certain undocumented immigrants who join the military or who choose to attend a four-year college or university.
Hoyas for Immigrant Rights sponsored a screening of “Dreamer: A True American Story,” a film about an undocumented young person, held in Lohrfink Auditorium following the rally.
McDonough School of Business Dean David Thomas expressed his support of the DREAM Act at the screening.
“When a DREAMer shared his story with me, I became educated about this issue in a way that surprised me,” he said.
The university has also said it is in favor of changing the nation’s immigration system.
“We are strongly supportive of making sure that provisions like the DREAM Act are included in the immigration reform bill,” Assistant Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said. “I’m pretty optimistic that will happen. I would be shocked if not.”
Fleming said the university supports several other important immigration reform measures such as visas for science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduate students, calling it a “high-priority concern.”
De La Cruz said that students have a unique and important role to play in the movement.
“We definitely see that young people have stepped forward and become a vital part of battling to get immigration reform passed,” she said.
Selene Ceja (COL ’13), media team organizer for the Georgetown rally, agreed with this assessment.
“I think our impact is we want to have immigration reform talked about … so people can be aware of what immigration reform is,” she said. “We’re trying to humanize the movement, trying to create a pathway to citizenship so it will be fair and just.”

More than 1,400 students will walk to honor cancer survivors and raise funds for cancer research at Georgetown’s eighth Relay for Life tonight.
Georgetown’s Relay has raised more than $2 million since 2006. This year, participants had raised $130,000 as of Thursday evening, and coordinators hope to reach $225,000 by the end of the event Friday through club fundraisers, which will make money through fundraisers, including selling bubble tea and tickets to play cornhole. Associate School of Foreign Service professor JamesVreeland will charge $5 for students to compete against him in his annual push-up contest.
“We still have a shot to hit our goal,” Relay Co-Chair DanSilkman (COL ’15) said.
As of Wednesday, 121 teams had registered for the event, while Relay chairs had hopes for increased participation by the end of the night.
“We hope to have 2,000 [students signed up] by the end of the week,” Relay Co-Chair Molly Paris (SFS ’13) said. “It might seem like a long shot right now, but people always sign up last minute because they don’t really know what they’re doing this weekend yet.”
This year, the annual School of Foreign Service Diplomatic Ball is on the same night as Relay.
“There’s always a conflict in the spring,” Paris said. “If it’s not Dip Ball, it would be some other event.”
In an effort to encourage participation of the approximately 750 students attending Dip Ball, Relay will offer free food for Dip Ball attendees who come to Relay after the ball.
Last year, Relay raised about $185,000 — a total they could eclipse this year. But it is unlikely that fundraising will reach levels attained in 2008 or 2011, in which approximately $382,000 and $400,000 were raised, respectively.
Relay teams range from groups of friends to campus organizations. This year, the team of Relay executives is leading fundraising, having collected more than $16,500 so far. Hoya Blue, which raised more than $12,000 last year, is in second place with more than $6,000 to date.
“I really like seeing everyone at Georgetown come together. It’s one of the biggest events on campus,” Hoya Blue Team Captain Rachel Carrig (COL ’13) said. “Seeing everyone agree upon this one thing, and seeing all of Georgetown rally to help fight cancer is really inspiring.”
The money Relay raises is sent to the American Cancer Society, which then distributes the money between initiatives to facilitate cancer research, caregiving and legislative action.
The Office of the University President, Students of Georgetown, Inc., the Center for Social Justice and What’s After Dark also contribute funding for Relay.
