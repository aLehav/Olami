Bess Rosenzweig (COL ’13) and her mother, Claire Clube, 49, died in a plane crash in Kenya on July 25.
Rosenzweig, 22, was from Cambridge, Mass. and graduated from Georgetown with a degree in Psychology in May. She often travelled, especially to Africa, and held dual U.S. and British citizenship, as did her mother.
The plane’s pilot, Harro Trempenau, also died in the crash.
The chartered aircraft was found in the Aberdare Range inAberdare National Park on Saturday, according to Kenyan newspaper The Star, which reported that the aircraft likely crashed after encountering bad weather. The cause of the accident remains unknown, though some have speculated that the pilot miscalculated the route’s visibility.
U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Robert F. Godec released a statement announcing the deaths.
The Hoya will follow up with more information in its first print issue of the academic year.
