The Georgetown University Medical Center obtained a grant Nov. 13 to bring a new science education program to middle and high school students in the Washington, D.C. area.
The $217,475 grant was awarded by the Amgen Foundation, which gives money to nonprofit organizations that help to advance science education and the quality of health care worldwide. The Foundation will help GUMC launch the Amgen Biotech Experience in D.C. in 2014. The funding should last for two years and will be eligible for renewal in June 2015.
“I applied to make an impact on biotechnology education in D.C. metro schools,” grant recipient Jack Chirikjian, director of the GUMC biotechnology program, said.
The Amgen Biotech Experience, a three-week program, provides middle and high school teachers with a new curriculum and equipment at no charge to participating schools. For each teacher, Amgen Biotech Experience provides enough equipment, reagents and manuals for an anticipated maximum of 34 students, working in pairs. All equipment must be returned after three weeks.
“Teaching laboratory science and innovation can be challenging if teachers may not have the required science support, equipment, reagents, the proper teaching tools or the required science background,” Chirikjian said. “The anticipated outcome is that scientific concepts, and skill sets will be introduced to middle school and high school students at an early age.”
The Amgen Biotech Experience has been implemented in schools in the United States, United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. More than 50,000 students and science teachers participate each year, and the program has reached over 300,000 since its inception in 1990.
“The success of the Amgen Biotech Experience is due in large part to the grantees in our communities,” Amgen Foundation President Lim Terra said. “The collaboration with undergraduate institutions and nonprofit organizations helps give students real-world, hands-on lab experience to introduce them to the excitement of biotechnology and scientific discovery.”
According to Amgen Foundation spokesperson Kristen Davis, Amgen Biotech Experience was created to provide students with hands-on scientific experiences and to strengthen the quality of the science teaching workforce. Such resources have been scarce in recent years thanks to cutbacks in educational funding on a national level.
“The National Academies’ National Research Council has shown a significant connection between strong lab experiences and teachers’ abilities to generate student interest in science,” Davis said. “The Amgen Biotech Experience seeks to help make this connection in secondary school classrooms by introducing students to contemporary science techniques, including a robust, hands-on curriculum, research-grade equipment and comprehensive teacher training.”
In particular, Barbara Bayer, Georgetown senior associate dean of biomedical graduate education, emphasized the importance of teacher training. During the Amgen Biotech Experience, Chirikjian and a number of his colleagues will be present at the participating schools to help the students and teachers.
“This is actually helping instruct the teachers because a lot of the teachers don’t have enough background in this area to keep up with the technology,” Bayer said. “It’s reaching out to the community and providing our expertise for a need to accelerate education in this area.”
Correction: A previous version of this story erroneously stated that Amgen Biotech Experience has reached over 50,000 students and teachers since its inception. The program reaches 50,000 students and teachers each year and has had over 300,000 participants since its inception.

	Chief of Police Jay Gruber has decided to extend GUSA’s Outdoor Student Living Pilot Program, which allows students of legal age to drink beer and wine in designated areas of Henle Village and Village A.	The pilot program will continue through the spring semester, a decision based on the lack of write-ups in those permitted areas.	“We measure success by the fact that we didn’t hear anything. We didn’t see anything, we didn’t have to do anything,” Gruber said.	A comprehensive evaluation of the program, which will also take write-ups into consideration, will take place over the summer. The Department of Public Safety, Georgetown University Student Association and the Office of Residential Living will use this evaluation to make any suggestion to extend the program to other areas of campus, potentially including Village B and Nevils Hall.	When introducing the program, GUSA and the Office of Residential Living stressed that it was intended to make on-campus living more attractive, but thus far, few students appear to have utilized the option to drink near some dorms.	“I don’t think I’ve seen a group congregate in that area since the program only affects the barbeque area outside the community room, and students never really leave their immediate apartments,” said Kyla McClure (COL ’15), a resident assistant in Village A.	Adrian Prado (COL ’14), a resident assistant in Henle, said that he thought the program would be more popular in the spring, with the advent of nicer weather. However, Prado voiced doubt that RAs would be able to hold students accountable under the new program.	“We, as RAs, have a list of people in our area who are 21 and under but then it becomes inconvenientevery time we see someone out there, it’s like, do we go and ask them if they’re 21? Do we have any reason to suspect that they’re over 21?” Prado said.	Other students have also noticed a lack of participation.	“I think it’s a good idea; I just haven’t seen students act upon it,” Henle resident Julie Negussie (COL ’14) said.	GUSA Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14), who championed the program when it was introduced in September, said that while he is unsure as to whether this program fulfills the goal of making on-campus housing options more attractive, it is a step in the right direction.	“I think this is a bit of a culture shift that we’re working at, and one policy won’t necessarily make that culture shift happen,” Ramadan said. “I think, when looking at the broader scheme of things -whether it’s getting rid of the one keg limit; whether it’s getting rid of party registration; whether it’s this outdoor social program – I just think we’re making positive progress on making on-campus living just as attractive as off.”	GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) also stands behind the program’s success.	“We’ve gotten feedback from students and from Chief Gruber and other administrators, and it’s been a huge success so far,” Tisa said. “Students were using it when the weather was nicer, and there have been no complaints from DPS or the Office of Residential Living or anyone else involved to my knowledge.”	According to Jiajia Jiang (NHS ’15), an RA in Village A, students who have been utilizing the program have behaved responsibly.	“We were really clear at the beginning of the year that it’s not a party outside – it’s just a small gathering only in specific locations, so people aren’t really going there at nighttime or anything,” she said. “If anything, people took more advantage of it when it was warmer outside with better weather and grilled in the daytime so it hasn’t really affected the RAs in any way.”

	With scant transportation options in the Georgetown neighborhood, the District has explored areas for innovation, including a gondola lift connecting Car Barn and the Rosslyn Metro stop.	This proposal is part of an effort to better connect Georgetown with local transportation through the Business Improvement District. Among the plans are a Georgetown Metro stop, streetcars and changes to the Georgetown University Transportation System shuttles.	“The advantage of gondolas is that they ease the friction of transportation. You hop off the Metro and hop on the gondola cars that are coming continually and carry you to Georgetown,” Georgetown BID Transportation Director Jonathon Kass said. “The gondola is a way to make Georgetown feel like it is an extension of the Rosslyn Metro station much sooner than we’ll be able to get a Metro station.”	A gondola lift, or a cable car, is an aerial lift, where cabins hang from a loop of cable that continuously circulates between the two terminal stations.	Although the Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom stops are both viable options for the gondola, Kass said that the Rosslyn station is preferable, both because of proximity and because the gondola lift would run above the Potomac River.	“The idea is to have a fast, efficient transportation link between Georgetown and the Metro station,” Kass said. “It would also be a spectacular experience and probably a tourist attraction in its own right.”	“We imagine some ways that the gondola station could actually be in a building like the Car Barn to get to the university’s elevation or the commercial district’s elevation in one stop,” Kass added.	The gondola plan is currently in its early phases, and uncertainties exist as to whether it will be cost effective.	“We’ve been talking to manufacturers to develop a feasibility study, but the use of gondola lifts for urban public transportation is growing in places like London and Portland,” Kass said.	In addition, BID is currently advocating for a new Georgetown Metro stop. According to Kass, the Metro’s current Momentum 2025 plan calls for an additional Blue line, separated from the Orange line, to better meet the city’s Metro needs. Kass suggested that the Georgetown station could fall on that new line.	“They’ve got to put tunneling equipment underground to do that, which is a huge expense,” Kass said. “Our view is that as long as they’ve got the tunneling equipment underground and have paid all that, just keep the tunnel going under the Potomac and build the Georgetown station as part of the Rosslyn project, which is part of the 2025 plan.”	BID is also planning to add a Georgetown streetcar, starting from the K Street corridor and extending to the university; it would cover the retail area of Georgetown, primarily revolving around M Street.	“A huge part of the streetcar plan is to have the track extend all the way to the university because it is a great base of ridership with a lot of jobs and a lot of transit-based lifestyles and also because the university has talked about having a maintenance and storage facility for the cars,” Kass said.	But while these options are long-term, Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey pointed to the GUTS buses as a short-term area of improvement.	“We have enough capacity with the GUTS buses to meet the demands,” Morey said. “The big question of transportation in the master plan is how we get to and from the campus to effectively transport these 2 million people.”	As part of the university’s 2010 Campus Plan agreement, all GUTS buses must enter and exit campus via Canal Road. The buses do not currently follow this route, and the university is considering adding a bus stop next to North Kehoe field, as it could provide direct access to the Georgetown University Medical Center and Leavey Center.	A second option is to create a route that loops around MultiSport Facility. This option, however, is undesirable because it does not reach the Medical Center or the Leavey Center, it would interfere with pedestrian routes, and it would require the creation of a road between Hariri and the MultiSport Facility.	“It’s really not good from a campus plan perspective where we want more of a pedestrian-friendly environment in the center of campus, and those routes will not allow where we want to go with that,” Morey said.	The third option would create a loop around West Road and Tondorf Road. However, this option is undesirable because it would increase traffic on Tondorf Road, especially around Kober-Cogan Building. It would also require the current stops at Harbin and the McDonough parking lot to be moved.	“If there were a bus coming through every three or four minutes up Tondorf and around MultiSport when people are walking, we don’t think that’s a very desirable option,” Morey said.	Moreover, another way to maximize ridership is to have all GUTS bus stops serve all destinations, as well as integrating the GUTS system with the Metro.	“There may be opportunity to integrate our transportation needs with the existing Circulator and WMATA transportation system, and we’re exploring those opportunities now. That type of engagement would require a lot of planning,” Morey said. “When you jump on a GUTS bus, you don’t pay anything. That obviously would not be the case if you jumped on a Metro bus, so there’s a lot of work that needs to be done to figure out how that would work.”

In line with the national trend, Georgetown’s endowment posted strong growth in fiscal year 2013, driven in part by improved returns on investment and the $100 million donation from Frank McCourt Jr. (CAS ’75).
Georgetown’s combined endowment had an 11.8 percent annual return on investments for fiscal year 2013, a marked improvement from fiscal year 2012’s 0.9 percent return, according to the Office of Investment, which manages the pooled endowment’s day-to-day operations, including asset allocation and portfolio management.
“The pooled endowment benefitted throughout fiscal year 2013 from an increase in its allocation to global equity and a tactical overweight to U.S. equities,” a representative from the Office of Investment said. “Throughout the year, we rebalanced into other developed markets as well, with an emphasis on Japan, and added selectively to our emerging markets exposure.”
Nationally, college endowments averaged an 11.7 percent return in 2013, up from a 0.3 percent loss in 2012, according to preliminary figures from a survey of 461 U.S. colleges jointly compiled by the Commonfund Institute and the National Association of College and University Business Officers. The full survey will be released in January and is expected to include more than 800 public and private educational institutions in North America.
According to the investment office, the improved growth can also be attributed to record low interest rates, reducing the risk to the university’s portfolio.
The strong performance in 2013 continues a long-term trend of success for Georgetown’s investment returns.
Over the last 10 years, the pooled endowment has generated an average of a 7.8 percent investment return annually, outpacing the national average of both a domestic equities portfolio and a passive 70 percent equities and 30 percent fixed income securities portfolio. The pooled endowment achieved this return with about half the volatility and risk involved in global equities.
According to the investment office, Georgetown pursues a mix of investment assets in order to reduce its risk while still producing as high of an expected return as possible. More specifically, the office’s target asset allocation is currently 50 percent equity, which includes stocks, 20 percent absolute return, which includes hedge funds and alternative investments, 15 percent real assets, which includes property and 15 percent fixed income.
Nationally, the growth this past year was largely attributed to a strong equities market fuelled by quantitative easing, whereby the Federal Reserve purchases long-term assets from commercial institutions to increase a country’s monetary base, along with additional forms of support from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. In line with the national trend, Georgetown has shifted to a higher proportion of equities in its portfolio recently.
“Most endowments are heavily tilted to equities and alternative investments seeking equity-like returns,” Douglas said. “As a result, returns will generally move in the same direction as equity markets in any given year, albeit to a lesser degree due to diversification into other asset classes like fixed income and commodities.”
The performance of the endowment, and thus the investment returns, is crucial for the university, according to the Investment Office.
“Georgetown’s endowment lends fiscal stability to the university and provides critical resources which enable the university to offer competitive tuition, support high-quality academic programs, attract top faculty and ensure that the brightest students have access to a Georgetown education,” the office stated.
Georgetown’s endowment, however, has been historically small, but recent charitable gifts have helped it grow, largely due to the Campaign for Georgetown.
The capital campaign was already set to pass its yearly target of $151 million before McCourt’s $100 million donation. The donation has pushed the campaign to increase its goal for this year to $225 million to reflect the university’s 225th anniversary, according to Vice President for Advancement R. Bartley Moore (SFS ’87).
“Now that’s going to be a bit more of a stretch,” Moore said. “But goals aren’t supposed to be easy.”
According to Moore, about 40 percent of donations to the campaign go toward the endowment.
“This is higher than the historic average both at Georgetown and in higher education fundraising generally, where it tends to be about 30 percent,” he said. “This reflects our ambition to accelerate steady growth in the endowment not only through sound investment but through increasing new contributions annually. That is the permanent foundation on which we are building the future of the university.”

In response to budget cuts, the Office of Residential Living reduced the Alumni Lounge hours to three nights per week at the beginning of November.
During the spring semester, the lounge will only be open for reservations. Student employees will be dismissed at the end of the fall.
“The decision to make this change rested with two important priorities: the interest to expand student meeting space on campus while reducing costs in a difficult budget climate,” Ed Gilhool, director of residential education at the Office of Residential Living, wrote in an email. “Ultimately, we hope this step offers students even more opportunities to gather and engage in this space.”
In the past, Alumni Lounge, located on the second level of Village C West, has been open to all members of the Georgetown community. The lounge contains flat screen televisions, pool tables, board games and other amenities for students to rent and use.
During the upcoming semester, the lounge will be closed unless a student group reserves the room between the hours of 9 a.m. and noon. Because student employees will be dismissed, each student groups will be in charge of setting up the room and cleaning it once their event has finished.
According to Gilhool, the Office of Residential Living will attempt to find jobs for the dismissed employees. Employee Michael Lindsay-Bayley (MSB ’14), The Hoya’s director of sales, has worked at the lounge since the beginning of this year.
“I’m not work-study, so I’ve found it really hard to get jobs on campus,” he said. “In terms of getting another job on campus, I’m not hopeful, but they said they were going to try, so we’ll see.”
Another student employee, Ari Peña (MSB ’15), has worked at the lounge for more than a year. Once he heard about the cuts, he found another job as a driver for D.C. Schools without the help of the university. Peña said that could not wait for common on-campus openings, like Residence Hall Office jobs, to appear for the fall.
“I found one on my own because I couldn’t wait until an opportunity at an RHO opened up,” he said.
“I was also concerned because, my first thought was, if the school can’t afford to keep essentially what is our current very small student center open, how are they planning on affording a larger student center in New South next year?” Peña added.
Peña said he understood why the university shortened the hours, but that the Office of Residential Living should keep the lounge open for weekends.
“To completely close it down, I don’t think that it’s the best call,” Peña said. “The reality is that for someone who’s just looking at a spreadsheet, it’s certainly difficult to justify the lounge because of attendance.”

	University President John J. DeGioia and Provost Robert Groves will launch a new initiative, “Designing the Future(s) of the University,” an effort to rethink the framework and future of education, Wednesday.	The university is launching the program to assert more control over its future during a time of change in higher education, especially in the face of massive open online courses and new approaches to teaching.	“This initiative was born in that, and we have called it ‘Designing the Future(s)’ because we believe that it’s not about being afraid of how we’re going to be disrupted or how we’re not going to be able to do what we want to do, but to ask the design questions,” Vice Provost for Education Randall Bass said. “What kind of institution do we want to become?”	Although the initiative will discuss what aspects of Georgetown will remain the most integral to its identity in the future, the program will also assess what Georgetown hopes to give its students in the coming years and how the boundaries of formal education can be expanded. The initiative is intended to explore issues related to education broadly, but no concrete changes have been announced.	“We’ve been building our capacity to think about this as a whole campus over the last few years, and now we believe we’re at a position to think not just about innovation at the course level but to think about innovation at the level of whole educational packages, how entire curriculum might be delivered,” Bass said. “We don’t expect that we’re going to change most of what we do, but we feel that what we want to do is generate a few experiments that really push the boundaries of the kind of education that we value.”	Possible changes to educational approaches include creating a dual certification program that will combine undergraduate and master’s programs that will span four to five years, skill-based learning that will allow students to complete degrees at their own pace and better integrating internships into the curriculum.	The initiative will also evaluate new ways of delivering the Georgetown education, focusing on massive open online courses. Georgetown launched its first MOOC on Oct. 1.	“The students coming to Georgetown now come to us with a great set of skills built around the internet, and other universities are exploring how we can redefine how we do educational programming,” Provost Robert Groves said. “We want to look at real concrete things, we want to let the students, and the faculty, and the alumni and student services examine whether we can have new kinds of degree programs that might be more self-paced.”	Incorporating these technological aspects into a liberal arts education at Georgetown will be a major focus of the initiative.	“We’re deeply committed to a version of liberal education, and I think we’re also committed to asking the question of what is a version of liberal education that can only be created in a world that is saturated with technology – global and fundamentally interdisciplinary, and it’s not just about preserving Georgetown liberal education from the past but reinventing it in this moment in history and in this point in the century going forward,” Bass said.	A spring 2013 course co-taught by Bass and distinguished visiting professor Ann Pendleton-Jullian called “The Future of Georgetown University as a Design Problem” explored similar ideas. They will teach the course again this spring.	After reviewing precedent studies about design, the course’s students were divided into groups and challenged to build a design for a university in by 2033, starting with the most basic level.	“It was very hard for us at first to say what boundary conditions to create in an education – where do we want students to bump up against, and where does the university do a really great job of that already and where do we maybe need to change those things,” Evan Markley (COL ’15), who took the course, said.	Although the class is not directly related to the initiative, Bass and Pendleton-Jullian recently presented the students’ final projects to Groves and DeGioia.	“They wanted universities that were all about learning through doing, and this issue about wanting to participate in the world,” Pendleton-Jullian said. “How do we prepare better for the real world? And how do we make sense of the world around us? So these became the themes running through the whole projects.”	The initiative will officially launch Wednesday with a discussion between DeGioia and Groves that will focus on the current challenges the university faces in higher education and provide framework for the future of the program.	After the official launch, the initiative will continue through a series of connected events that discuss the university’s educational mission and focus on the overlap between exploration of the issues of higher education posed by thought leaders, the engagement of students, faculty and staff and experimentation in ways to deliver a Georgetown education.	“We want to begin a dialogue, and students have got to be part of this,” Groves said. “It’ll be Georgetown’s way of reacting to new tools we have in the world and new student interests, and asking the question, ‘Can we do things differently in a way that achieves even deeper academic excellence than we’re achieving now?'”

	The John Thompson Jr. Legacy of a Dream Award will go to Lecester Johnson, executive director of the Academy of Hope, the university announced on Monday.	Johnson will be officially awarded Jan. 20 at Georgetown’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebration at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts. The award, named for Georgetown’s former men’s basketball coach, celebrates local emerging D.C. leaders who embody the values of Martin Luther King Jr. and the university.	“It’s a privilege to recognize Johnson for her outstanding work,” University President John J. DeGioia said in a statement. “She embodies the very spirit of service and a commitment to social and economic justice, which we seek to honor with this award, and which defines our tradition here at Georgetown.”	According to Associate Vice President for Community Engagement and Strategic Initiatives Lauralyn Lee, the Office of Community Engagement compiled recommendations for the award from Georgetown staff and D.C. community members. DeGioia made the final decision based on these recommendations.	“Starting last year, as part of the university’s efforts to refocus on the District, we thought it would be advantageous for the award and for the awardee if we gave the award to someone who identified as an emerging leader, who was doing work that was particularly meaningful to our local community and that was having demonstrated impact,” Lee said.	The award involves a year of community partnership between the organization and the university.	“Georgetown will be instrumental in helping us think about our long-term business strategy and how we position ourselves as adult literacy providers in the city,” Johnson said. “We’re hoping to do a lot more around advocacy and the body of knowledge about how you work best with adult learners … and we’re looking forward to working with Georgetown on that.”	Through its work, the Academy of Hope aims to increase adult literacy levels in the District and help adults earn high school diplomas before entering the workforce or higher education.	Johnson has worked at the Academy of Hope since 2006.	“I really came in with a passion for adult literacy and saw that Academy of Hope had a really good reputation and had a strong program going but really just needed a little extra work in letting the world know that we were here and doing some good work,” Johnson said. “We were really starting to move programs closer to helping adults get prepared for not only the GED but also work and secondary education.”	The Academy of Hope will transition away from nonprofit work by fall 2014.	“The transition to a charter school was a major necessity for us because the funding for adult literacy in D.C. and in this country is wholly inadequate,” Johnson said. “Going out to a charter was probably one of the easier ways for us to really change our business model from running off soft money to really going to a dependable source of funding for our core program.”	For Johnson, the Academy’s students have been the most rewarding part of her experience.	“The most valuable thing is seeing people achieve something that just seemed unachievable for them,” Johnson said. “Many of the adults that we’re working with have just gone through a rough time. … They’re beginning to blossom and go on to bigger and greater things.”

	The U.S. Department of State discontinued its $3.3 million budget for research grants that advance the study of Russian and Eastern European society, culture and politics this year, eliciting concerns from professors about the future of graduate and undergraduate programs.	Federal support for Russian and Eastern European research began in 1983 as part of the Title VIII Grant program, which aims to maintain expertise about various world regions. The State Department authorizes these grants on a yearly basis.	According to Harley Balzer, an associate professor of government and international affairs and former director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies, the program originally aimed to promote research and scholarship during the Cold War.	“With the threat of nuclear war between the two superpowers, knowing everything we could learn about the USSR and its Warsaw Pact clients was absolutely crucial to our security,” Balzer wrote in an email. “The goal was to make sure we could support graduate students to learn the languages, help junior faculty with research support to aid them in the tenure process and also encourage senior scholars to continue doing important work in the region.”	Balzer added that it is not surprising that support for these grants is waning today, as Russian scholarship has become less relevant since the USSR broke up in 1991.	“It is more difficult to make that case now,” Balzer wrote. “It really was a decision within the State Department, and they are chronically short of funds for a number of important things.”	Department of Slavic Languages associate professor Lioudmila Fedorova expressed dismay that the study of Russian language, culture and society has been de-emphasized.	“I was surprised. I was saddened. I’m very anxious,” Fedorova said. “We cannot underestimate Russia and its impact on modern political life.”	While Balzer agreed and cited the importance of Russia to the study of foreign policy and Eurasia, he acknowledged that the current post-Cold War political environment does not necessarily demand State Department funding.	“I would advocate our using some of our scarce budget resources to support language and area studies more broadly, rather than privileging any one region,” Balzer wrote.	Fedorova, however, voiced frustration that only tangible strategic and economic interests dictate the country’s academic focus.	“I think it’s very dangerous to look only at the areas of research that can give you something practical in return, the effects of which you can easily see,” Fedorova said. “It leads to a very limited picture of ourselves and the world.”	Nevertheless, both Balzer and Fedorova said that these cuts are too recent to feel their full impact. In particular, Fedorova noted that the cuts would primarily impact doctorate students and those pursuing postdoctoral work, as well as professors who wish to visit Russia and conduct research. The lack of funding for Russian study programs could also dissuade students from pursuing a major in these areas.	“I can foresee that in the long run, students who take Russian for say, pursuing a career in history of Russian or area studies, would think about other areas,” Fedorova said.	According to Fedorova, the funding cuts have resulted in the elimination of positions and even entire departments at other universities. Fedorova pointed to State University of New York’s Russian language program, which became online only, and Arizona State University, Indiana University and the University of Illinois, which have all suspended or cut research grant and scholarship programs related to the field.	“People are losing their jobs actually because of this tendency,” Fedorova said. “The situation in the field is very tragic.”	Georgetown, however, has managed to remain relatively unaffected thanks to the U.S. Department of Education’s Title VI program, which also allocates funds for particular regional studies. Title VI specifically funds National Resource Centers, which offer graduate degrees and language instruction focused on specific regions of the world; CERES is considered a National Resource Center.	“We are a direct beneficiary of that, and we hope that that will continue in the future, although that, too, is threatened,” Loring said. “That’s the big thing that we really don’t want to happen.”	According to Loring, as many as 20 scholarships could be lost if Title VI is defunded, and numerous study opportunities and course offerings would be affected.	Balzer suggested that the Title VIII cut is illustrative of a larger trend.	“We are weakening our capacity to compete economically, protect ourselves and to promote our ideas,” Balzer wrote. “It reflects a short-sighted view of the future, and one may only hope that the result will be merely significant, rather than tragic.”	Fedorova expressed hope that Georgetown would not abandon its program, regardless of funding.	“I would be very glad if the university could undertake any steps to somehow compensate or recognize the importance of this field,” Fedorova said. “That would be wonderful.”

	Student Activities Commission Marketing and Public Relations Director Patrick Musgrave (COL ’16) was elected SAC Chair by a 14-vote margin Thursday.	Musgrave was elected in a second round of voting after an inconclusive first round, in which some groups voting more than once, forced the Georgetown University Student Association Election Commission to hold a second race.	Forty-six SAC group presidents voted for Musgrave, and 32 voted for two-semester SAC Commissioner and New Club Development Coordinator Eng Gin Moe (SFS ’16).	“The whole idea of campus-wide SAC elections like we did this year is a very new one–it’s only a couple years old–so we’ll work with the SAC chair next year and think about ways we can ensure this doesn’t happen again,” GUSA Election Commissioner and designated SAC election commissioner Ethan Chess (COL ’14) said. “I think, all in all, it was a good learning opportunity in terms of seeing some of the things that can happen, and how to also fix them.”	Musgrave, who is a former staff writer for The Hoya, said he hopes to reduce the organizational difficulties and redundancies that student groups face in reserving campus space, approving events and budgeting.	“What I don’t want SAC to be looked at is as this police force that goes around and makes sure that every single group is following this minutiae, so I’m thinking more big picture. We make it easier for groups to be groups and give them the tools that they need to run a successful organization,” Musgrave said.	In order for student groups to organize events, they need to request funds from the university. The students then pay it back to the university for the cost of renting spaces.	“It’s money going in a circle,” Musgrave said. “What we would try to do is give the Office of Campus Activity Facilities money in the beginning, and then in exchange for that, any group can use it for free.”	Musgrave also aims to reduce the difficulties in getting speakers from outside Georgetown approved. SAC commissioners currently have to approve non-Georgetown speakers, which Musgrave thinks is an unnecessary burden.	Musgrave’s challenger, Moe, supported Musgrave’s ideas for reform. Moe’s platform focused on building connections between SAC commissioners and groups.	“I think that all those things, they’ve been hard to fix now because they require a lot of coordination among different groups, so if he can get the ball rolling on that and making sure he contacts all those people and has great dialogue with them, I think it’s feasible,” Moe said.	This race was the group’s second-ever contested election.	“I feel that Patrick and I definitely learned from each other’s campaigns, and hopefully he’ll take some of my ideas under his chairmanship,” Moe said.	Before Musgrave takes over as chair in 2014, he will shadow current SAC Chair Jennifer Chiang (SFS ’15) for the next month and a half.	Moving forward, Musgrave is excited to work with student groups and the Georgetown community at large to streamline existing processes.	“I want to make SAC a resource for student groups to put on great events to improve their communities,” Musgrave said. “We have a lot of great communities here at Georgetown, and all of those communities can collectively make the campus community better.”

	A perception of homogeneity within GU Pride has led students to found two new discussion groups for students who are part of less prominent components of the LGBTQ community.	The Queer Women’s Collective and a discussion group for transgender students invite students with a relationship to each identity to discuss issues more specific to their experiences.	“[GU Pride] is still a very male-dominated group, and that would get frustrating because it didn’t feel like a space that was entirely welcoming to everyone,” said Queer Women’s Collective founder Meghan Ferguson (COL ’15), a former president of GU Pride. “There were very few women involved coming to meetings and events.”	Lexi Dever (COL ’16) saw a similar need for a space for transgender students.	“This support group needs to be present so that people who struggle with such identity issues have somewhere to go and people to talk to,” Dever said.	This focus on specific identities differs from the goals of GU Pride, which encompasses the entire LGBTQ community.	“Pride is a big umbrella community, whereas they’re allowed to advocate on specific issues all the time. I think [separation] is a very good, healthy thing,” GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) said. “I think that they support the community in ways that Pride can’t always do because we do have to support all aspects of the community at all times.”	Though he acknowledged the need for more focused LGBTQ groups, Lloyd refuted some of the criticism that GU Pride is gay male-centric, pointing to the fact that four of 10 board members are female. During his term, Lloyd has pushed for greater collaboration with other student groups and for events focusing on socio-economic status, race, gender identity and ableism, among other issues.	“I still think that the notion that GU Pride, institutionally, is gay male-dominated is kind of unfair,” Lloyd said. “Pride has increasingly in the last year moved more and more to be as large a tent as possible.”	These discussion groups focus less on Pride’s public activism and more on support for members.	“[Pride is] very much the out ‘Let’s go wave flags in Red Square,’ which can be a turn-off to some people who maybe aren’t comfortable being out yet,” Ferguson said. “I would hope that [the discussion group] is kind of more approachable in that sense to people for whom Pride isn’t appealing for that reason.”	Though the Queer Women’s Collective is more focused than GU Pride, it will not be limited to women who identify as gay.	“We specifically want this group to be open to not only queer women but people who identify as maybe gender queer or anyone who has at any point in their lives identified with woman or female or girl in any way,” Ferguson said. “That way, it’s a space that’s inclusive to everyone, including people who may not necessarily feel specifically attached to the label woman or even man at that point.”	The small size of each group has facilitated an intimate atmosphere for discussion.	“It’s a small community, and there hasn’t been much demand for it,” Dever said of the transgender discussion group. “Now that we have that community, we’re really pushing to help the transgender community as much as possible at Georgetown.”	To Dever, this could lead to some kind of education down the line as well.	“There’s generally positive reaction towards trans rights and such,” Dever said. “Most people are on board with that, but most people are not as well educated about it and don’t know everything about transgender issues.”	Both groups will tailor their goals to whatever will benefit their members.	“I would just like this to be a space where people can use it for their own needs,” Ferguson said.

	In the wake of complaints about strict restrictions on eligibility for Washington’s medical marijuana program, Mayor Vincent Gray has convened a Medical Marijuana Advisory Committee to assess current policies.	According to Gray’s official order, released Oct. 28, the advisory committee will work with the D.C. Department of Health to monitor practices in other states, as well as scientific research regarding the use of medical marijuana.	District residents have been able to purchase medical marijuana for qualifying conditions since July 29, which is the product of over two decades of lobbying and debate.	An Intergovernmental Operations Subcommittee will monitor the effectiveness of the current medical marijuana program, and a Scientific Subcommittee will review applicable scientific research. Both subcommittees will review the practices of other states.	The Intergovernmental Operations Subcommittee consists of Department of Health Director Joxel Garcia, Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs Director Nicholas Majett, Metropolitan Police Department Chief of Police Cathy Lanier and City Administrator Allen Lew. Members of the Scientific Subcommittee will be appointed by the DOH director.	Currently, the medical marijuana program only covers conditions such as HIV/AIDS, glaucoma, muscle spasms and cancer, making it one of the most restrictive in the country. Though D.C. has an HIV/AIDS infection rate of 2.4 percent, or approximately 15,000 of its residents, only 89 people are enrolled in the medical marijuana program, as of Nov. 18.	Additionally, only 62 out of the District’s 1,400 doctors have picked up the medical marijuana prescription forms, and 39 have actually used them as of Oct. 21.	During the Oct. 18 D.C. Council hearing, advocates for expansion of the program pushed for the loosening of restrictions on eligible conditions and further education of doctors about prescribing marijuana for medical purposes.	Organic medical marijuana distributors such as Capital City Care, the District’s first medical marijuana dispensary, are eager to see an expanded list of conditions added to the program to increase eligibility for those not currently covered. Capital City Care owner David Guard said his business would need more patients to stay open during the Oct. 18 hearing.	“This is an important milestone, and we’re excited to see things moving forward. We look forward to working with the committee to address concerns about the sustainability of the medical marijuana program,” Capital City Care Communications Director Scott Morgan wrote in an email. “We’ve heard from many patients who are eager to see more medical conditions added to the program, so I’m sure the committee’s work will be followed closely in the patient community.”	Gray spokesperson, Doxie McCoy, was optimistic about the advisory committee’s potential.	“Mayor Gray is confident the advisory committee, and any city agencies involved with medical marijuana policies and practices will collaborate to ensure an effective program,” McCoy wrote in an email.
 Correction: A previous version of this story erroneously stated that 39 District physicians were licensed to prescribe medical marijuana and that 62 physicians had picked up the necessary forms. The 62 physicians picked up the necessary recommendation forms for prescribing marijuana, and 39 of them have actually used the forms to formally recommend and prescribe medical marijuana to patients. In addition, the story originally stated that 59 patients were enrolled in the medical marijuana program. As of Nov. 18, there are 89 patients enrolled.

Contributors to BuzzFeed, The Huffington Post and Reddit focused on storytelling Saturday at the School of Continuing Studies, emphasizing the need to cover stories from unique angles in the age of viral content.
The Storytelling Summit, the first part of the Georgetown Innovation Series, drew approximately 100 students, professors and staff.
“You get a million hits on a boring topic like the government shutdown … by finding the story that no one’s told before, telling it with humor and telling people something that they had never seen before,” BuzzFeed’s Viral Politics Editor Benny Johnson said.
Attendees heard from a variety of speakers, including journalists, university administrators and photographers.
“We wanted to create an event that was unlike anything that any university has hosted before,” Program Manager for Innovation & New Media Strategy Michael Wang (MSB ’07) said. “We wanted to be a thought leader in creating interactive experiences, not just another 60-minute lecture with a famous person.”
The summit’s organizers were called “chefs,” and Wang was “head chef.”
“Quirky is what we’re going for,” Sous-Chef of Design Shantel Jairam (MSB ’15) said.
Vice Provost for Education Randy Bass discussed Designing the Future(s) of the University, an initiative led by Provost Robert Groves that will reinvent the way the university tells stories about itself.
Other speakers included Huffington Post Managing Director Jimmy Soni and reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.
Following the presentations, the speakers held a variety of workshops that encouraged storytelling without writing.
According to Chef of Special Projects and Experience Helen Brosnan (SFS ’16), the workshops were an important supplement to the keynotes.
“We’re talking about all of these broad ideas, and it’s great and you’re listening … but you don’t get hard skills out of it,” Brosnan said.
Summit attendee Natasha Janfaza (COL ’17) appreciated the day’s focus on less traditional methods of storytelling.
“I enjoy storytelling, but I know that I only really know it in a few modes, like with words or pictures,” Janfaza said. “I wanted to learn about what the future of [storytelling] could be and experiment with it.”
The second part of the Georgetown Innovation Series will consist of a Hackathon in February, during which participants will spend 24 hours solving various problems. One goal of the Storytelling Summit was to empower participants to develop a strong narrative in order to pitch their ideas at the upcoming Hackathon.
Chef of Programming Innocent Obi (SFS ’16) hoped the Storytelling Summit and the Hackathon would be an opportunity for participants to redefine the image of Georgetown students.
“Georgetown is a very policy-based school,” Obi said. “No one really imagines Georgetown students as innovators.”
