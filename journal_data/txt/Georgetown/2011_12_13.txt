Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki visited campus this morning to meet with University President John J. DeGioia, School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster, professor and former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R.-Neb.) and other members of the university.
Al-Maliki’s visit rerouted foot traffic around campus and within Healy Hall, and caused delays near the Canal Road entrance from 9 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.
The meeting between al-Maliki and university leaders was not open to the press.
Al-Maliki met with President Barack Obama at the White House Monday to discuss the future of Iraqi-American relations as the United States prepares to withdraw all of its troops from the country by Dec. 31. He also met with members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce today.
