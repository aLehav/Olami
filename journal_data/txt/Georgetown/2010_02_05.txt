On Tuesday Robert Kimmitt, former deputy secretary of the Department of the Treasury under President Bush, discussed the general employment trends as well as the global economic environment in a lecture in the Rafik B. Hariri building.
At the lecture, “Operating at the Intersection of Business, Finance and Government,” which was organized by the Distinguished Leaders Series, Kimmitt commented on the numerous jobs he has held in his life and how this has become a trend among working-age people in the United States.
“Your generation doesn’t have a concept of a single employer,” he said. “The average American worker . will have 10 different employers in the first 20 years in the workforce.”
He identified this as an accelerating change in employment habits in the United States that is based on flexibility, mobility and education.
“[The McDonough School of Business’] focus on leadership and [willingness] to operate at that intersection between business, finance and government sets you apart,” Kimmitt said.
He proceeded to discuss the growing involvement of government in business decisions, focusing on the role of the G20 in world politics, particularly since the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.
Kimmitt referred to the World Economic Forum recently held in Davos, Switzerland, and the G20 meeting held in Washington, D.C., in November 2008 during his discussion of the international economic situation.
“The global imbalances are principally three: the twin deficits in the United States, both fiscal and trade, the misaligned currency in China and low-demand growth in Europe and Japan,” he said.
He added that deficit reduction in the United States is imperative for improving global conditions, as the country accounts for 25 percent of the world economy. He cited this as the most significant challenge facing economic improvement and job reaction.
“Deficit reduction [is very important] to relieve pressure on economic growth,” Kimmit said.
He concluded the lecture by offering advice to graduating students about to enter the workforce, and later answered a number of questions regarding U.S. business relations with China and the European Union, among others.”

On Feb.1, the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, representing the Georgetown, Burleith and Hillandale neighborhoods, unanimously passed a resolution that recommends the renewal of the District of Columbia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board’s moratorium for Georgetown, yet increased the maximum number of liquor licenses permitted in the area by two.
According to the ANC2E, there are currently 15 active, transferable liquor licenses in the Georgetown Moratorium Zone and that the addition of two more would accommodate economic expansion in the area without disrupting the peace.
The ABC’s moratorium on the issuance of new liquor licenses in Georgetown will expire in April. The moratorium, which requires a renewal every five years, covers the area within an 1,800-foot radius of the intersection at Wisconsin Avenue and N Street, according to ANC Commissioner Tom Birch.
Birch said that the original intent of the moratorium was to attract business to the area.
“[The moratorium exists to] ensure a balance of commercial establishments best serving the interests of residents, visitors and the business community, particularly in a historic district whose character is a magnet for tourists as well as a shopping destination for many,” Birch said.
The moratorium exempts all hotels, regardless of establishment date, as well as businesses in the Georgetown Park, Georgetown Park II, Prospect Place Mall, Georgetown Court and Washington Harbor areas.
While the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board is not bound by this resolution, which was proposed by ANC 2E Vice Chairman Bill Starrels (SMD05), the commission’s recommendations are considered by D.C. agencies.

Among the tens of thousands of people gathered in Copenhagen, Denmark, last December were five members of the Georgetown community four students and a professor who reconvened on Wednesday in the Mortara Center for International Studies to share what they had gained from their experience at the largest climate conference to date.
The panel, entitled “What Happened in Copenhagen: Perspectives from the Georgetown SFS Delegation,” consisted of Joanna Lewis, assistant professor of the Science, Technology and International Affairs Program, Jessica Robbins (SFS ’12), Olivia Chitavat (SFS ’10), Kathryn Padgett (SFS ’11) and Julia Shindel (SFS ’10).
Therese Miranda (SFS ’09) and Erin O’Sullivan, a graduate of American University, also spoke after attending the conference through SustainUS, a nonprofit and nonpartisan group for young people advocating for environmental sustainability.
Besides its unprecedented size, the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference that ran from Dec. 7 to Dec. 18 differed from other UN events. One of its most notable features was the significant involvement of various heads of state, including President Obama.
“You don’t usually have heads of state rolling up their sleeves and fighting over a text, word by word,” Lewis said.
According to the panelists, another distinguishing feature of the conference was the presence of people from various countries. Up to 100,000 people participated in protests calling for legally binding action.
“The lesson that everyone, and by everyone I mean the 60,000 that flooded Copenhagen with very strong convictions, learned is that negotiations are fine, but we need to start acting on the ground,” Padgett said.
“What are really going to push the boundaries are these people doing on-the-ground work,” Chitayat said.
Despite the protesters’ hopes, the conference did not result in any binding agreement. The Copenhagen Accord, the final product of the conference, expressed that the planet must work to keep temperatures from rising above 2 degrees Celsius, while it does not legally bind any country to actions meant to achieve such a goal.
“At the end of the day, the consensus seemed to be, `Where is my change? I don’t believe in this anymore,'” Shindel said.
Lewis, however, called the accord “the most concrete thing to come out of a process that has been going on for 15 years,” beginning with the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1994.
“Dissent became a very solid theme throughout the conference,” Shindel said. “I was struck by the amount of frustration from people with the process.”
Several of the panelists noted that the structure of a convention of this scale made a legally binding result unlikely and expressed the belief that grassroots action is a more effective solution to slow climate change.
“The biggest take-away I got from this, from all the speeches and all the discussions, is to talk to your senators, start organizations, get involved,” O’Sullivan said.
The panelists also expressed hope in the role of youth in promoting a sustainable environment.
“The experience defined really the limits, possibilities and potential that students have in effecting climate change both internationally and in their communities,” Robbins said. “We’re the ones who have the most to gain and the most to lose in the next few years.”
Lewis and the panelists will be compiling a documentary of their experience that they hope to premiere in late March.
The discussion was sponsored by the Mortara Center for International Studies and the Science, Technology and International Affairs Program.

The McDonough School of Business rose two spots in the 2010 Global MBA rankings published by The Financial Times this January, moving from 40th place to 38th place, primarily in response to improvements in research and placement success.
“We are extremely excited. We are getting recognition that we are actually taking the right steps to position the school where it belongs,” Deputy Dean of the MSB Ricardo Ernst said.
According to The Financial Times Web site, the rankings are based on three main areas: alumni salaries and career development, diversity and international reach, and research capabilities.
The rise in the MSB’s ranking can be attributed to an improvement in its research rank as well as placement success rank, according to Jett Pihakis, associate dean for MBA Programs.
The business school saw a 10-place jump within the research component, which is based on the number of faculty publications in top academic and practitioner journals.
“The administration here has been very encouraging of faculty to continue to focus on scholarly research productivity without sacrificing the quality of teaching in the classroom. We have a faculty that do both quite well,” Pihakis said.
The MSB has hired 16 new professors this year, which both Pihakis and Ernst said has had a large impact on the increase in research. According to Pihakis, the improvement in research is particularly critical because it is weighted heavily in the calculation of the total ranking.
The MSB also improved significantly in the placement success component, moving from 42nd to 32nd place. Schools are judged in this aspect based on alumni perception of the usefulness of career services.
“There are many variables that affect the rankings, but if you were to evaluate all of the variables under our control, we are making an explicit effort to improve in each one of those,” Ernst said.
According to Pihakis, the MSB still has room for improvement in certain areas in order to rise further in status.
“We strive to get a greater percentage of women on our faculty and on our board,” Pihakis said.
The opening of the Rafik B. Hariri building this fall did not have any notable impact on this year’s Financial Times rankings because the alumni surveyed for the report graduated three years ago and did not have access to the building at that point. According to Pihakis, the building will likely have an effect on the MSB’s standings in the Businessweek and U.S. News and World Report MBA rankings.
“The new building has been able to provide the right synergy. For the first time, we have all the programs, students and faculty in one building, and the energy that we are able to generate will start to pay back in the future,” Ernst said.”
