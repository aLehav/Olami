Israeli actions, including the development of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, are putting the pursuit of a two-state solution to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict at risk, according to Maen Rashid Areikat, chief representative of the General Delegation of the Palestinian Liberation Organization to the United States, in the Bunn ICC Auditorium on Thursday.
“The best approach to resolve this conflict is going back to the basics. The basics of freedom, human rights, dignity, security, peace for all,” Areikat said. “If we all can agree that every nation, every people are entitled to the same rights, to the same privileges, to the same freedoms that other nations are entitled to, I believe we can always find a solution to the most difficult issues.”
School of Foreign Service professor Tamara Sonn, the Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani Professor in the History of Islam, introduced Areikat, who addressed a crowd of about 150.
Areikat said the United States, under President Donald J. Trump’s administration, must work with Israel to pursue a two-state solution. Areikat criticized the Trump administration’s reported efforts to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which both Palestine and Israel claim as their capital.
“They will only embolden Israel to be more aggressive and to rely on the logic of power instead of the power of logic in dealing with its neighbors and resolving conflicts,” Areikat said.
While promoting a peaceful resolution to the conflict, Areikat blamed the strife’s perpetuity on Israeli intransigence, suggesting that a continuation of Israel’s settlement policy in the West Bank could lead to a failure of the two-state solution.
Both Israel and Palestine have said a two-state solution, with an independent State of Israel and State of Palestine, is their preferred solution to the conflict. The two sides, however, have been unable to agree on border placement, among other issues, in attempts to strike a deal.
“We still believe that a two-state solution is the most ideal outcome for any political negotiations with Israel,” Areikat said. “Israelis and Palestinians must be separated in order for them—especially Palestinians—to develop their own national identity away from occupation and oppression, and for Israelis to reap the fruits of the peace and security that they have long desired.”
The PLO officially recognized the right of Israel to exist in the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords. According to Areikat, Palestine does not pose a danger to Israel.
However, Areikat said the only path to stability for Israel in the region is a settlement with Palestine.
“Israel’s security will be guaranteed if they make peace with the Palestinians who are going to share the land with them. They cannot make peace with any other Arab countries if they cannot make peace with us. They will never enjoy security,” Areikat said. “It’s not because we are threatening them; it’s because there will be no stability if we Palestinians do not feel that we are getting our rights back.”
Delta Phi Epsilon, Georgetown’s professional foreign service fraternity, arranged the event, but as an unrecognized student group without access to benefits, needed Sonn to reserve the auditorium.
Areikat said Arabs and Palestinians prioritize resolving this conflict, even if some Israel advocates say surrounding Arab nations do not care about it as much as other conflicts in the region.
“No matter what Israel tries to portray that Arab countries are busy and the Palestinian issue is on the backburner – maybe that applies to some Arab governments, but it does not apply to the Arab masses who continue to believe that the Palestinian people are an oppressed people who need to win their freedom,” Areikat said. “We continue to extend our hands for peace, but it takes two to tango.”

As the Senate vote looms to confirm Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency, climate change advocacy group Students for Climate Security is organizing protests to oppose Pruitt’s nomination.
Justin McCartney (SFS ’19), director of senate outreach strategy for Students for Climate Security, said Pruitt lacks the qualifications necessary to head the agency.
“Not only does he not believe in climate change, he has had the experience, the legal experience as Attorney General, specifically fighting against regulations, which is awful,” McCartney said of Pruitt.
McCartney also said the group is mobilizing students to contact their senators in opposition to Trump’s nominee.
“Getting students to call their senators, send emails, join up with groups like the Sierra Club or 350.org to push that sort of outreach to the senators to make sure that they know we’re not happy with Scott Pruitt or his positions climate change or his ties to the fossil fuel industry,” McCartney said of plans to reorganize.
McCartney said further action and protests are planned for once the final date for the senate vote on Pruitt’s confirmation is confirmed.
The group is also putting together packets with former White House environmental studies and articles highlighting Pruitt’s negative record to send to Senators.
Pruitt has declined to say in senate confirmation hearings if he will voluntarily recuse himself from a series of lawsuits he is currently leading against the EPA.
Twenty three conservative advocacy group, including the Club for Growth political action committee and lobby group Americans for Tax Reform, have endorsed Pruitt’s nomination. Pruitt’s nomination appears secured, according to Politico. He can lose two Republican votes and still be confirmed.
Namratha Sivakumar (SFS ’20), a member of SCS, said Pruitt favors corporate interests over protecting the environment.
“He is basically gunning for corporate interests and deregulation, and he wants to use the Environmental Protection Agency as a way to sanction environmental degradation,” Sivakumar said. “That is not what the institution is made to do and I think he’s completely antithetical to the mission of the program.”
SCS has received guidance and support from Government professor Andrew Bennett. Bennett said he strongly opposes Pruitt on the basis of his public record.
“Of all the cabinet-level nominees who are antithetical to the missions of the departments or agencies to which they have been nominated, Pruitt is in my view the least suited to public service,” Bennett wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As Attorney General of Oklahoma, he sent letters drafted by fossil fuel lobbyists to the EPA, President Obama, and other federal officials under his own signature, without identifying their true authors.”
Sivakumar said the group originally formed in response to anxiety over the incoming Trump administration. Its first protest was a march from Red Square to Myron Ebell’s office on L Street on Nov. 18 to protest Ebell’s appointment to head the EPA transition committee.
McCartney said climate change deniers cannot be in government.
“Climate change isn’t something you can put off. It’s something that has to be taken seriously,” McCartney said. “It’s something that you can’t overlook in favor of fossil fuel industry benefits.”
Students for Climate Security has received support from students in a wide array of states in an effort to reach out to the Senators who will vote on Pruitt’s confirmation, according to Sivakumar.
“We have students from swing states and students from Republican-controlled states that are really making efforts to talk to their senators, talk to their representatives, to make sure we have people in Congress fighting the appointments of those who work against the environment,” Sivakumar said.
Bennett said he is proud of the students’ work.
“I have never been prouder of Georgetown students,” Bennett wrote. “Beyond the immediate focus on Pruitt and environmental issues, the students in our group are learning a lot about how to organize to influence policies.”

Christine Fair, a professor in the School of Foreign Service, has come under scrutiny after former Georgetown professor Asra Nomani filed a complaint that she had been the subject of Fair’s repeated cyber abuse in light of The Washington Post’s op-ed on Nov. 10 in which Nomani detailed her decision to vote for President Donald Trump.
“This is my confession — and explanation: I — a 51-year-old, a Muslim, an immigrant woman ‘of color’ — am one of those silent voters for Donald Trump,” Nomani wrote. “And I’m not a ‘bigot,’ ‘racist,’ ‘chauvinist’ or ‘white supremacist,’ as Trump voters are being called, nor part of some ‘whitelash.’”
Nomani was a professor in the practice of journalism from 2007 to 2008 and was the co-director of the Daniel Pearl Project from 2008 to 2011, which profiles the case of Daniel Pearl, a journalist who was kidnapped in 2002.
Fair, who is currently on research leave, soon began responding to Nomani’s article, first with a Facebook post and later with a, “flurry of really rude, dehumanizing, and disrespectful” tweets, according to Nomani, on Nov. 22. The exchange has since raised larger questions about the role of freedom of speech in academic environments.
“Yes. @AsraNomani I’ve written you off as a human being,” Fair wrote on Twitter. “Your vote helped normalize Nazis in DC. What don’t you understand, you clueless dolt?”
Fair and Nomani also exchanged a series of direct messages in which the conflict between the two escalated. After Nomani sent Fair a direct message asking for civility, Fair responded that Nomani should not write pieces if she cannot handle public criticism.
“You got a lot of media out of your vote. Can’t stand the heat? Don’t go into the kitchen. Also I have so little regard for you. Go enjoy the hell you’ve helped create,” Fair said. “Also go f—k yourself.”
In an exclusive interview with The Hoya, Fair said Nomani’s direct message was unwarranted.
“It just struck me as, you break up with someone, they send you one of those emails, I just want to be friends. Well, I don’t want anything to do with you, and I made it really clear,” Fair said.
Nomani initially filed a complaint with SFS professor Bruce Hoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies and the Security Studies Program, on Dec. 2. Nomani asked the university to provide Fair with “training regarding her public interactions” and an apology.
She followed up her complaint to the SFS with a Jan. 5 complaint to the Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action organization.
Fair claims Nomani’s initial Dec. 2 complaint was not triggered by initial tweets, but rather by a tweet Fair sent claiming Nomani had manipulated evidence of their conversations in a tweet to a professor researching journalists who had been covering Trump.
“So once I busted her for just outrageously lying, she begins tagging every potential and possible agency at Georgetown. If she could have tagged dining halls she would have, and it was only after my pointing out to this professor that she just completely mischaracterized this entire exchange that she literally went ballistic,” Fair said.
According to Nomani, her complaint was triggered by continued aggression from Fair following her initial tweets in this interaction and a Facebook post following Nomani’s complaint.
Fair made an open post on Facebook, telling Nomani to “f—k off and go to hell.” According to Nomani, Fair also sent a private letter saying she was going to file a legal complaint.
Fair said she only used crude language with Nomani in private messages.
“The only time that I actually use any kind of crude language with her was in our direct message, a private message, in response to her unwanted messaging, all of her other complaints were not sent to her,” Fair said. “So in terms of the particular language, ‘f—k off and go to hell,’ that was actually a Facebook post I made about her and not to her. And in particular it was about her complaining to Georgetown.”
Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said Fair’s tweets do not reflect the views of Georgetown.
“As an academic community we hold dear our commitment to free speech and expression. Being committed to the free and open exchange of ideas does not mean, however, that we approve of or endorse each and every statement made by members of our faculty,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The views of any faculty member are their own and not the views of the university.”
Pugh said the complaint is currently being looked into through confidential university processes.
Following the exchange, Fair received both harassment on Twitter and threats of violence. According to Fair, she was advised to remove the computer from her office in case it was stolen.
“I know how troll armies work,” Fair said. “So she did beset her troll army on me.”
Nomani has a history of creating drama to attract attention, according to Fair.
“This is her M.O., where she goes and creates these dramas that gives her various hits on Fox News,” Fair said. “Basically she lives, literally, for these dramas.”
Fair said the complaint being filed raises larger concerns about academic freedom of speech.
“This tactic of appealing to people’s employers is really retrograde. And the left has done it, the right has done it, and I’ve opposed it in both cases,” Fair said. “Because unless we are born with a trust fund, we all need jobs. And if our employer can lay claim to everything that we do and say 24/7, we no longer have freedom of speech.”
Nomani said Fair’s conduct online raises concerns about her conduct in the classroom.
“When we engage in dialogue we can’t, it’s just as the harassment policy says, we can’t berate, demean, insult and harass another human being for their perspective,” Nomani said in an interview with The Hoya. “That’s what I don’t appreciate, and I think that we need to set some standards because I’m a person who can speak up. But my concern is for students in the classroom for whom this professor or any other professor can create an intimidating environment.”

Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority users faced long lines and extended wait times Saturday with around 500,000 people using the service, including many demonstrators from across the country who poured into the city for the Women’s March on Washington.
In an internal email provided to The Hoya, WMATA General Manager and CEO Paul Wiedefeld said the Metro system saw elevated ridership numbers over the weekend. Between Friday and Saturday, Metro transit, which include trains, buses and paratransit, saw over 2 million passenger trips, according to Wiedefeld.
He also told employees that Saturday marked the second-busiest day in Metro’s history with over 1,001,613 entries into the rail system.
Metrorail ridership for Sat, Jan 21 = 1,001,616 #wmata
— Metro (@wmata) January 22, 2017

The all-time record for single-day Metro ridership is held by 2009’s Inauguration Day — the first inauguration of former President Barack Obama — when entries surpassed 1.1 million.
The statistic WMATA provided for this Saturday’s ridership recorded the total number of SmarTrip card swipes in one day. If each Metro passenger used the system both to travel to and from an event, the number of passengers who used the system is closer to 500,000.
Another measure of traffic is the availability of spots at Metro parking lots and garages. At about 10:30 a.m. Friday, only two parking stations were above 60 percent capacity. By comparison, at 10 a.m. Saturday, 20 stations were at or above capacity, per the WMATA Twitter account.
Despite adding more than a dozen trains on the Red and Orange Lines and advancing opening times by two hours, Metro infrastructure experienced a considerable uptick in traffic, leaving riders waiting several hours for trains around the march’s perimeter.
In light of several challenges the Metro system has faced in recent years, including derailments at the East Falls Church and Metro Center stations in August 2015 and July 2016, Wiedefeld highlighted his pride in Metro use over the weekend.
“This success is especially impressive given the monumental challenge of sustaining such an operation over back-to-back days, along with the logistical challenges that come from national special security events,” Wiedefeld wrote in the email.
James Zhang (MSB ’19), who rode the Metro for both the inauguration and Women’s March, said there was a noticeable difference in traffic between Friday and Saturday.
“During inauguration, we left campus around 6 a.m. because I assumed that the Metro and the streets would be packed with people either protesting or going to inauguration,” Zhang said. “When we got to the Dupont station, a pretty empty subway train rolled up to the platform. If I recall correctly, there were probably about four other people in our car.”
Compared to Friday, Zhang said the heightened attendance at Saturday’s march made riding Metro “nearly impossible” Saturday.
“When we left campus at 10:30 [a.m.], there were already groups of people walking into D.C. from across the Key Bridge,” Zhang said. “When we got to the platform, we waited for about an hour for a train that could squeeze in four people.”
Although WMATA did not provide an official figure for Friday’s traffic, the bureau gave an 11 a.m. update on its official Twitter account, saying that 275,000 trips had been taken, compared to 193,000 trips at the same time the previous day.
Metro Ridership: As of 11am, 193k trips taken so far today. (11am 1/20/13 = 317k, 11am 1/20/09 = 513k, 11am 1/20/05 = 197k) #wmata
— Metro (@wmata) January 20, 2017

Mitali Mathur (SFS ’19), who attended the protest using Metro Saturday, said the enhanced schedule and service was not sufficient for the high influx of riders attending the protest, but that the atmosphere was amenable.
“It was quite crowded, we were at Rosslyn and the first five trains that passed were completely packed, so we decided that if the next cars were completely packed we would walk because we figured it would only get more crowded,” Mathur said. “But the atmosphere was quite nice, everyone was very supportive and they welcomed us.”
Other transportation modes were similarly affected by the high demand caused by the protest. Kristin Davis (COL ’19), who used the ride-hailing service Uber both days, expressed shock at the Saturday fare surcharge.
“For the Women’s March, there was a considerable price surge and I had to run to a different location to meet the Uber driver to be picked up,” Davis said. “It was really difficult to get an Uber back.”
In recent days, attempts to estimate crowd sizes at the inauguration and the Women’s March generated debate and tension between the White House and media outlets. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer challenged crowd estimates in a press conference Saturday.
“This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration — period — both in person and around the globe,” Spicer said.
This claim, which WMATA figures disprove, has been debunked by multiple media outlets.

Theater has the power to raise awareness for issues affecting underrepresented populations, as highlighted in a Gaston Hall event featuring actress Anna Deavere Smith hosted by the Office of the President on Jan. 19.
Smith discussed her Pipeline Project, which uses theater to highlight issues within the school-to-prison pipeline. The event Doing Time in Education: The School-to-Prison Pipeline was a lecture and performance followed by a question-and-answer session, with Smith moderated by University President John J. DeGioia.
A professor at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University and artist-in-residence at the think tank Center for American Progress, Smith performs using a method of theater of her own invention, in which she takes on the persona of people whom she has personally interviewed. Smith has interviewed 253 people for her performances.
Smith performs the conversations as authentically as she can, including the specific body language, tics and speech patterns of her subjects. With this technique, according to Smith, she is able to emphasize a diverse range of voices.
Smith performed excerpts from her show “Notes From the Field: Doing Time in Education” at the event. The show features interviews she conducted across the country concerning the link between education in low-income communities of color and high incarceration rates, a civil rights issue commonly called the school-to-prison pipeline.
Smith said the purpose of her work is to honor a message her grandfather imparted on her that “if you say a word often enough, it becomes you.”
“I have spent my career of more years than I’d like to say going around America trying to become America word for word,” Smith said.
Niya Kenny was among the interviews Smith chose to highlight Thursday. Kenny was arrested after she stood up for a black female classmate who was thrown to the ground by a school officer in October 2015.
The video quickly went viral online alongside complaints of police brutality.
In her portrayal of Kenny, Smith used the nervousness and persistence of the teenager to examine the way she fought against the assault on her classmate.
“But he just threw a whole girl across the classroom. How can you mind your business?” Smith quoted Kenny in response to criticism that she should not have gotten involved. “That’s something you need to make your business.”
Though the term “school-to-prison pipeline,” an implicative term that refers to a phenomenon where students in communities of color are more likely to end up in prison than finish high school, is present in today’s educational discourse, Smith said the overall problem is much larger.
“I have a problem with it being called the school-to-prison pipeline — and that’s just what it’s called, I didn’t name it that — because I feel that the sentence itself blames schools and teachers for something that’s much, much more complicated than that, and that something is poverty,” Smith said.
Performing as Sherrilyn Ifill, the president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Smith expressed that the election of Trump is pivotal for people to become politically engaged.
“There’s a lot of heaviness in the country at the moment, a lot of pain,” Smith said, portraying Ifill. “In this moment is a space where change can happen. The only one. Particularly in a country that’s entrenched in issues of race. A moment when we move is a moment when we have to confront ourselves. This is it.”
At the event, DeGioia said Smith’s method acting helps foster empathy towards issues affecting underrepresented populations.
“You mentioned when we spoke earlier today about ‘moral imagination.’ It is not traditional for universities to place a disproportionate emphasis on imagination. We’re places for reason and rationality and reasonableness and the pursuit of truth,” DeGioia said. “But what you captured earlier in your presentation is just how important it is to be able to take on the identity and persona of the other, to be able to imagine what it’s like to be that other person.”
According to theater professor Derek Goldman, co-director of Georgetown’s Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics, which uses theater to humanize global politics, and artistic director of the Davis Center of Performing Arts, the type of activism that Smith has accomplished through her immersion in the arts is representative of the spirit of Georgetown’s own theater program.
“The role of Georgetown’s theater on campus is so much in the spirit of what she’s been a leader in. It’s at the intersection of social change, social justice, new work, listening, global work across disciplines,” Goldman said in an interview with The Hoya. “She epitomizes that through solo work that’s in dialogue with so many voices, which I think is such a beautiful, inspiring model for what an individual can do in the world as a listener and as a change agent.”

Georgetown ranked 12th out of a list of 38 schools with more students from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the bottom 60 percent, according to a New York Times study based on anonymous tax records published Jan. 18.
The median income for a parent of Georgetown’s class of 2013 was $229,100, the 8th highest of the 2,395 colleges surveyed. Twenty-one percent of Georgetown’s approximately 6,700 undergraduates are from the top 1 percent, which is among the highest amounts for the 10 schools in the Big East Conference.
The rankings are based on incomes calculated using records of 30 million students who graduated between 2002 and 2013 from more than 2,000 American colleges.
According to The New York Times, students whose families make $630,000 or more per year are considered part of the 1 percent. Students whose families make less than $65,000 annually are classified as part of the bottom 60 percent, which accounts for 13.5 percent of undergraduate students.
While the data in The New York Times study spans students born between 1980 and 1991, the amount of students from the bottom 60 percent and top 1 percent remained consistent for every year.
Seventy-four percent of Georgetown’s undergraduate student body come from the top 20th percentile, with the average Georgetown student in the 85th income percentile.
After graduation, 1.9 percent of graduates between 2002 and 2013 moved from the bottom to top income quintile and 11 percent of students moved up at least two income quintiles.
While 3.1 percent of Georgetown students are from the bottom 20 percent, a student from the bottom fifth of incomes has a 61 percent chance of moving up to the top 20 percent of incomes after graduation, according to the study.
Sixty-nine percent of Georgetown alumni end up in the top 20 percent after graduation. Specifically, the median individual income for Georgetown alumni by the time they are 34 years old is $84,400.
Compared to other schools in Washington, D.C., Georgetown has among the lowest amount of students who end up in bottom 20 percent after graduation, with only 8 percent of its undergraduates falling in that income bracket.
In The New York Times’ mobility index, which incorporates both access and outcomes to illustrate the likelihood of a student moving up two or more income quintiles, Georgetown is ranked 1985th out of 2137 colleges. However, mobility at Georgetown is on par with or better than other elite schools. Princeton is ranked 2096th, while Duke is 2014th.
While acknowledging that Georgetown is a wealthy school, Georgetown Scholarship Program Director Missy Foy said that the university’s efforts are commendable given the size of its endowment compared with other schools it competes with for applicants.
“We certainly are very wealthy. You have a lot of students coming in from that top 1 percent, perhaps more so than peer institutions, but other than that we are not out of line from our peer schools, and we have a fraction of the endowment,” Foy said. “Even schools that have a huge endowment are strugglingto get students from the bottom fifth to apply and enroll.”
Foy said she believes the main issue causing Georgetown’s lack of socioeconomic diversity is a lack of sufficient scholarship funds.
“Where we are truly struggling is in terms of money,” Foy said. “I would like to see more donations to current use or the endowment so we can enhance our scholarship packages and bring in a more diverse population.”
According to Foy, the percentage of students on financial aid is a more detailed indication of a school’s socioeconomic landscape than the income percentiles and quintiles used by The New York Times.
“From what we’re seeing, 10 percent of students can identify with a low-income experience. Forty-five percent of Georgetown students are receiving some form of financial aid,” Foy said. “Financial aid is a bit more nuanced than income quintile.”
Foy said donations to the university’s endowment are crucial to maintaining and then increasing the amount of scholarships Georgetown can provide, which decreases the financial burden on low-income students and increases their odds of attending.
“I commend President DeGioia to stay firm on our commitment to meet full financial need that costs the university $100 million a year. I consider that an investment, not a cost,” Foy said. “But every year you better believe the board of directors has to look at that budget item and say is this something we can keep on doing. Every year the university has to find out where are we going to come up with that money.”

Attending Georgetown University for my master’s was the BIGGEST mistake of my life. I got a crap degree with asshole classmates and questionable academic quality, but more importantly, I have over 70, 000 dollars of student debt that accumulate thousands of dollars in interest every year that I will likely never be able to fully pay off. Why I didn’t go to a state university for my master’s is something I will be kicking myself in te butt for for the rest of my life.
