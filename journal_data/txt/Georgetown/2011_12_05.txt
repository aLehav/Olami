The GUSA senate voted unanimously Sunday to send a proposal on how to spend the $3.4 million Student Activities Fee Endowment to a student body-wide referendum.
The proposal, which was finalized by the senate’s Finance and Appropriations Committee last week, allocates funds from to finance the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, a Georgetown Energy initiative and the New South Student Center renovation effort.
Fin/App allocated $1.25 million to the SIPS Fund, $250,000 to Georgetown Energy’s initiative to install solar panels on the roofs of university townhouses and $1.6 million to the construction of an outdoor terrace on the south side of the New South Student Center.
Students will vote on the three proposals from Jan. 24 to Jan. 26. Each item must receive at least 2,000 votes, a majority being for the proposal, for it to pass. Proposals receiving less than 2,000 student votes, either for or against, will not be considered ratified by the referendum.
According to Senate Speaker Adam Talbot (COL’12), the three proposals will be voted upon separately.
“Each proposal [is] created and worded in a way that will not affect each other if any of them fails to pass,” he said.
Talbot added that the passing of the proposals is a momentous step for GUSA.
“We have an enviable responsibility to allocate 3.5 million dollars of student money,” he said. “The proposal will be the largest student investment in solar energy in the country. It will show that Georgetown believes strongly in service and entrepreneurship, and that we are doing something for student space on campus that will last the next 20 or 30 years.”
GUSA President Michael Meaney (SFS ’12) also spoke in favor of the proposals.
“[This] is a process that has been happening for a decade since the Student Activities Fee Endowment was created,” he said. “I emphatically and unequivocally endorse the final proposal.”
Some senators expressed concerns, however, about feasibility, particularly for the New South Student Center proposal. The plan was allocated just over $2 million of the $2.4 million requested by its proponents.
Fin/App Chair Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) said that although each proposal asked for more money than was allocated, the earnings from interest rates and fundraising efforts can fill the gaps.
GUSA senator Clara Gustafason (SFS ’13), one of the backers of the SIPS fund, said she didn’t think the fund’s operation would be severely affected, although the proposal received only $1.25 million of the requested $1.5 million.
“Under the worst case scenarios with no fundraising at all, the SIPS fund will still last until 2028, but I am tentatively optimistic about fundraising [efforts],” she said.
Tyler Eldridge (COL ’13) and Evan Abrams (SFS ’12) dropped their claim that Georgetown Energy has plagiarized their idea for a revolving sustainability loan fund.
According to Malkerson, all of the proposals should have long-term benefits on the Hilltop.
“Every proposal is phenomenal and will impact the community in very positive ways,” he said. “The bill we see before us today keeps the interest of students in mind and will be the best allocation of student money.”

Jesuits were evacuated from Wolfington Hall around 7:30 a.m. Monday after a mechanical malfunction set off the building’s fire alarm.
Five fire trucks arrived at the scene shortly after. Though the D.C. Fire Department quickly determined that there was no fire in the residence, it took until about 8:20 a.m. for them determine the exact cause of the alarm.
“Basically what we had was an overheated elevator motor … in the elevator machine room [in the building’s basement] that kicked off the alarm,” DCFD Captain Larry Settle said.
The trucks left the scene at about 8:30 a.m. after the university called an engineer to fix the malfunctioning motor. Residents were also allowed back into the building at this time.
Jesuits clustered outside the building maintained a positive attitude.
“We haven’t has this much excitement since the fire in 1973,” Fr. Stephen Fields, S.J. said.

With the recent surge in support for Newt Gingrich in the GOP primary race, a chapter of the national Students for Newt organization is joining the ranks of candidate groups on campus.
Beginning their efforts with a publicity push today, the budding organization hopes to reach the same prominence as groups like Georgetown for Obama and Hoyas for Huntsman.
The chapter currently has three members, although Deputy Coalition Director Kevin Preskenis (COL ’12) said that involvement will increase as the group became more established.
“We’re very much in the organizing stage,” he said.
Preskenis also serves as the national youth coordinator for the nation-wide Students for Newt organization. While he assumed his positions in Students for Newt last week, he previously served as managing editor for Renewing American Leadership, a non-profit charity founded by Gingrich for which he had been working since 2009. Preskenis left the organization to work for Gingrich’s presidential campaign.
Students for Newt hopes to expand to 85 campuses across the country in the next few weeks, according to Preskenis. The organization is currently focusing its efforts on colleges and universities in Iowa and South Carolina, states that are important in the first rounds of the upcoming Republican primary elections.
Angela Morabito (SFS ’12), a member of the Georgetown chapter of Students for Newt, began working as the national movement’s communications director for the D.C. and Virginia area a week ago. A Georgia native, Morabito sees a personal connection with Gingrich.
“Newt used to be my neighbor, so I grew up knowing about him,” she said.
Morabito said she is optimistic about the group’s future, despite their slow start.
“I think we started at just the right time,” she said. “This is a good opportunity, because when you hear the words ‘student activism’ or ‘student campaigning’ you think of Students for Obama, you think of Occupy DC, you think of [groups] that are pretty far left. For people who share a different viewpoint, and there are many of us on campus, … this is really just a great chance to be a student leader.”
Correction: The article previously stated that Kevin Preskenis (COL ’12) is currently the managing editor for Renewing American Leadership. Preskenis left the charity to work for Newt Gingrich’s presidential campaign. The article also previously said that Angela Morabito (SFS ’12) is in the class of 2013. The article has been updated to reflect these changes.

The Alternative Spring Break program will offer two new trips this spring, delving into changing social issues with one trip to New York and Washington, D.C., and another to Detroit.
The two trips, which bring the total number of ASB options to 17, will explore issues of education and race, respectively.
The “Urban Education Immersion” trip will visit a variety of public, parochial and charter schools in the District and New York City in order to introduce students to a variety of education approaches.
Colleen Gravens (COL ’14), one of the trip’s leaders, hopes that the week can allow students who do not participate in education-based service throughout the academic year to get hands-on experience in the area.
“You can tell from the participation in DC Reads and DC Schools that there is a large interest in education at Georgetown,” she said. “This trip will be a great opportunity [for] students who don’t have time for that commitment to meet different students, teachers [and] educational leaders and hear their thoughts on how to provide better education in urban areas.”
Arianna Pattek (SFS ’12), training chair for the ASB planning board, said the trip is important for the university, especially as its new education minor continues to grow and develop.
“The program will foster dialogues about the challenges of urban education,” she said.
One of the goals of the trip is to translate the week’s experiences into continued service work when students return to the District, according Sasha Panaram (COL ’13), the other student leader for the trip.
“We hope to invite students to think about innovative approaches used to combat the achievement gap and inspire them to take what they learn and determine how best to share and apply that knowledge with the D.C. community,” she wrote in an email.
The “Race, Dialogue, Renewal: Detroit” trip will explore the history of racial tensions and shifting demographics in the city.
“ASB trips have rarely traveled to places north of D.C.,” said trip co-leader Eileen McFarland (COL ’12). “Detroit would be an interesting city to explore because of the revival going on after its economic struggles and population [loss].”
McFarland added that she hopes to foster a comfortable environment to discuss how racial identity affects society and to engage participants in community service.
According to trip co-leader Kevin Flannery (COL ’12), the students will partner with Detroit’s Jesuit Volunteer Corps during their time in the city.
“We want to explore the challenges Detroit is facing,” Flannery said. “The city has a rich history with its automobile industry, racial separation and significant Jesuit presence.”
Both trips are designed to complement the other 15 ASB options.
“We share the same objective as other ASBs,” Flannery said. “We strive to look in-depth [at] social justice and give the participants the opportunity to reflect and rejuvenate through the trip.”

At an infection rate of 3.2 percent, HIV/AIDS levels in the District exceed the World Health Organization’s classification of an epidemic and rival the rates found in developing countries. The Georgetown community is finding new ways to combat the incurable illness as well as the stigma that has made AIDS a four-letter word.
 
Treating an Epidemic, Creating a Community
Mary Young, assistant professor of medicine in the infectious diseases division of the Medical Center, serves as the principal investigator of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study. The Georgetown chapter is one of six national sites that together treat over 3,700 infected women.
The program works closely with local women, providing them semi-annual physical exams, questionnaires and blood work. Since forming in 1993, WIHS has cared for nearly 400 women in D.C., most of whom continue to check in with Young every six months.
“We have women who’ve never missed a visit in 18 years,” Young said.
Another program on the Hilltop focuses on infected children and their families. Affiliated with Georgetown University Hospital, the Pediatric AIDS/HIV Clinic works with 40 local families with children infected with the virus. The clinic provides medical examination, education and around-the-clock care.
“We are very hands-on. We take care of them,” said Charlotte Barbey-Morel, chief of pediatric infectious diseases.
Through the program, physicians often develop a close relationship with the kids they treat.
“Some of the patients, I have known them since they were born,” Barbey-Morel said. “We really are a family.”
The families gather with doctors, social workers and staff members during the summer and at an annual Christmas party.
“We try to make it a fun place for them rather than just a place for them to get blood tests,” Barbey-Morel said.
A vast majority of patients were infected with HIV at the time of birth, and growing up with this disease poses innumerable challenges. Barbey-Morel said a big part of care is simply providing a place for these children to discuss the virus openly and learn ways to cope.
“None of them talk about HIV to their friends,” Barbey-Morel said. “[In] some families not even the brother and sister know.”
She added that the stigma these children face is in some ways as bad as the disease.
 
Overturning the “Death Sentence”
“In certain communities in D.C., you find out that someone has [AIDS] and it’s like a death sentence. No one wants to associate with you,” Greg Germain (COL ’12), president of Grassroot Hoyas, said.
Founded by Georgetown alumni, the Grassroot Project recruits student-athletes at local universities to teach awareness, prevention and community leadership to local middle school students. In conjunction with Grassroot chapters at The George Washington University, American University and Howard University, the project serves 18 area middle schools, focusing attention on students ages 12 to 14 years old — the age at which many at-risk youths become sexually active.
“Our philosophy is to get at the root of the problem,” Germain said. “Hopefully that will teach them at a very young age about the risks that they are taking, so they can be responsible.”
Last Thursday marked World AIDS Day and the middle school students’ graduation from the Grassroot program at the Kennedy Recreation Center. In addition to reviewing the core skills taught in the program, the kids also played on a moon bounce and in an obstacle course.
But Grassroot’s primary educational goal is to foster a more open dialogue.
“We need people to talk about it more, that’s why it’s such a problem. Because of the stigmas attached to it, you don’t tell anyone,” Germain said.
At the beginning of the nine-week program, participants sign a contract that promotes a respectful sharing environment. Germain said that it takes time for the kids to feel comfortable enough to come forward with more personal stories.
“We’ve had a few kids come forward saying, ‘My mom has AIDS,’ or ‘My sister died of AIDS,'” he said. “You’re happy that they opened up, but it’s sad at the same time.”
Germain said that overcoming this stigma is the project’s most powerful tool against the spread of AIDS.
According to Dominique Hall (COL ’12), president of Georgetown AIDS Coalition, the District-wide stigma attached to HIV-infected individuals is present even on the Hilltop.
“The more people that [Georgetown students] meet affected by it, the more we can make progress on the issue,” she said.
To commemorate World AIDS Day, the coalition handed out fliers informing the campus community about the virus’ presence in the District. The coalition also sponsored a forum, “The HIV/AIDS Experience,” led by Maryanne Lachat, professor of “HIV/AIDS: The Impact of the Epidemic,” a class in the School of Nursing and Health Studies.
Overall, Georgetown AIDS Coalition seeks to promote awareness and advocacy for HIV not solely as a global epidemic, but primarily as a local one.
“We’re an international school, so obviously we have a lot of people who are passionate about [the international fight against AIDS],” Hall said. “But when I first joined the group, I thought there needed to be a lot more emphasis on D.C.”
The coalition has teamed up with the medical school’s own coalition to make Georgetown students more aware of the disease in their own backyard. The group works with local non-profit Food and Friends to deliver fresh meals to home-bound patients. Last January the group presented “Unity Live,” an annual concert featuring undergrad a cappella and dance groups, raising over $1,500 for Miriam’s House, a shelter for HIV-positive women.
“That’s the time that campus is the most united. Everyone has a common goal and understanding. It’s the only time where we set aside time for the campus to observe the issue,” Hall said.
Although antiretroviral drugs have made the disease manageable and the media attention that demonized victims of the virus in the 1980s and ’90s has faded, HIV/AIDS still continues to strike at an epidemic rate in the District.
“Today you see people out and living with AIDS, so people think, ‘Oh it’s not really a big deal anymore,'” Hall said. “But for people who are affected, it’s a big deal.”

Four students were recognized as winners of the Interfaith Dialogue and Service Video and Essay contest Friday.
The contest, which is a part of the President’s Interfaith and Community Service Challenge, selected students who addressed ways the university’s Jesuit values affect their respective faith backgrounds and community involvement in their submissions.
Grand prize winner Kieran Halloran (SFS ’14) reflected on losing his father, a firefighter, in the September 11, 2011 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. Halloran’s essay, which was selected for its honesty and its emphasis on dialogue, focused on how he was inspired by those who chose to live as men and women for others.
“While this experience fostered the greatest amount of anger and hatred that I have ever felt in my life, it has also, through a roundabout way, fostered the greatest motivation to love and serve others that I have,” he wrote in his essay.
Halloran was inspired to enter the competition by his involvement with the President’s Challenge initiative.
“The initiative has really helped me to look at my faith and other peoples’ faiths in a whole different way,” he wrote in an email.
Stephen Patrick (COL ’13), the second place winner, along with Colleen Tapen (NHS ’13) and Vivian Ojo (SFS ’14), who tied for third place, wrote about how their faiths, community service work, international travel and future goals have influenced their Georgetown experiences.
“I really liked [the essays] because they show the diversity of what Georgetown is,” said Melody Fox Ahmed, a member of the judging committee, which was comprised of students, faculty and staff.
Ahmed, who serves as assistant director for programs and operations at the Berkley Center, said submissions by students who did not have a real faith tradition or who primarily reflected on their community service work still reflected the university’s Jesuit ideals.
“The work is the same. The humanity is the same. Being a man and woman for others is still the same,” she said.
Tapen, whose essay is entitled “A Non-Believer Making a Difference,” said that while she has not attended official interfaith events, her roommate, who is deeply involved with interreligious dialogue, motivated her to apply.
“Through my essay, I wanted to convey that a Hoya need not be religious to make a difference in the world.  That all Hoyas, regardless of creed, can be men and women for others,” Tapen wrote in an email.
Patrick, who only recently began attending interfaith events on campus, enjoyed reading the other winning essays.
“The other winning essays were really good and I learned something from all of them,” he wrote in an email. “I think the contest was really successful as an exchange of ideas and experiences.”
Winning essays are available on the Berkley Center’s website.
The essay contest is one of several activities intended to address the university’s chosen theme for the President’s Challenge — combating domestic poverty and improving educational opportunities. The first-place winner received $500, while the second-place winner and two third-place winners received $350 and $150, respectively.
The university will continue to plan interfaith and service-based programming as part of its year-long commitment to the initiative. Programs are being organized by Campus Ministry, the Center for Social Justice and the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs.
The national challenge, which the university accepted in September, is supported by the Department of Education and the Corporation for National and Community Service. The schools deemed the most successful will be recognized by the White House in spring 2012.
Because there were no video submissions by the initial deadline, that portion of the contest will be continued in the spring semester. The White House has asked the university to send the video winners to be featured in the national initiative.

Amid a still-stagnant economy, local businesses have begun aggressively preparing for the holiday shopping season.
In an effort to boost holiday spending around the area, the Georgetown Business Improvement District will sponsor 12 Days of Merriment Dec. 9-20.
The event will feature sales at participating stores, holiday events and reduced parking rates.
“I won’t kid you — it has been hard work these last few years,” said Bobbie Medlin, the owner of handmade accessories store Bobbie Medlin at 2900 M St. “It gets slow … [but] I’m proud to say I’ve kept the doors open.”
Medlin, who creates jewelry out of tribal antiquities, worked on producing a new line of accessories and just released the new collection this past weekend in time for the holiday season.
“If you have something wonderful to offer … that gives you a leg up,” she said.
But Medlin said that the economic climate is still grim.
“My sense is that most places are struggling,” she said.
Laura Weir, manager of Babette at 3307 Cady’s Alley, felt that her store was doing well, though she said that may be because it is relatively new. The San Francisco-based store opened its doors just off M Street in March.
“If anything we’ve seen an increase because we are so new,” Weir said.
For the holidays, Weir said she and her staff were focused on making the shop’s layout more accessible as well as reaching out to top customers for a pre-sale event before an open sale on Dec. 15.
“People are always consuming,” Weir said.
Medlin said she thought that small businesses were more susceptible to economic strain than the national chains lining M Street and Wisconsin Avenue.
“Its hard for small business owners,” Medlin said. “We don’t have volume on our side.”
Nonetheless, she tries to remain positive.
“I’m always optimistic, you have to be. We’re climbing out of the recession. It’s a slow road out … [and] as a community we need to support small business because we always see them drop by the wayside,” Medlin said. “Small businesses are an important part of our fabric.”

Aiming to begin screening candidates next month, administrators have drafted a description of an ideal candidate for a new university provost and will soon hold a town hall meeting to gather student input.
In a leadership statement, the committee of students, faculty and staff that is spearheading the search outlined the qualities they are seeking in a replacement for current Provost James O’Donnell, who announced his retirement in August. O’Donnell has been at the university since 2002 but will step down at the end of the academic year.
According to Committee Chair Wayne Davis, the search committee has determined that previous experience is the most important factor in choosing the next provost.
“Our main priority is an outstanding academic record,” said Davis, who is also chair of the philosophy department and president of the faculty senate.
Candidates’ administrative skills, previous published works and respect for [the] university’s Jesuit values are also important.
“We’re looking for someone to increase diversity and build the sense of community we’ve got,” Davis said. “Taken for granted … is personal integrity. For as we know, sometimes presidents and provosts run amok. Fortunately, we haven’t had that happen.”
The committee will begin reviewing applications in early January and hopes to present three candidates to University President John J. DeGioia by March, according to Davis.
The university has hired Witt/Kieffer, a professional recruitment firm, to identify qualified candidates in academia. Witt/Kieffer previously led the searches for the Dean of the School of Foreign Service-Qatar, the Dean of the McDonough School of Business and the President of the university.
Jeanne Lord, associate vice president for student affairs, will meet with a select group of students in the next week to further discuss what the university is looking for in O’Donnell’s replacement.
“We wanted to have some student input before we departed for the holiday,” Davis said.
The search committee, along with the Georgetown University Student Association, plans to hold a town hall for the student body early next semester. GUSA Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) is excited for the students to have an opportunity to share their input.
“We have a real opportunity to shape the next provost, because it’s someone that will be around for the next 10 years,” he said. “There’s a lot of [good] that the next provost can do in helping shape the curriculum and the way Georgetown functions, so I think it’s very important that we have someone who [pays] attention to detail and can also connect with students. Because while they do serve all faculty, it’s very important that they learn about students’ progress.”
