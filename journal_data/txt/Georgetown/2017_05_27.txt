James H. Shelton III, the president of Chan Zuckerberg Education at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, urged graduating students in the School of Nursing and Health Studies to believe in their own limitless potential in his commencement address Saturday afternoon.
Shelton was tapped to lead Chan Zuckerberg Education, a science- and education-focused limited liability company launched by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, in May 2016. Prior to that, Shelton served in both the public and private sector, including a six-year stint as program director for education at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and as assistant deputy secretary and deputy secretary of education from 2013-15 in former President Barack Obama’s Department of Education.
Rabbi Rachel Gartner, Georgetown University director for Jewish life, commended NHS students for choosing to serve others beyond Georgetown in her opening remarks. Gartner also called for a moment of silence in remembering the passing of Andrea Jaime (NHS ’17), a Georgetown student who would have graduated with the NHS Class of 2017 but died of bacterial meningitis in September 2014.
“In this open and beautifully vulnerable state, we are in touch too with an aching etched into our souls by the absence of one of our own who should be standing here with us today,” Gartner said. “We honor this moment for Andrea Jaime, whose physical presence we all mourn, but who we feel most palpably today among us.”
The ceremony honored students completing the bachelor’s program in health care management and policy, human science, international health and nursing, as well as students completing masters programs in health systems administration and nursing.
NHS Dean Patricia Cloonan said this year marked the first graduation for students specializing in  the clinical nurse leader program of the master’s degree in nursing, as well as the executive master’s in health systems administration.
This year also saw the first graduating cohort of doctors of the nursing practice program. The nine students who earned the doctor of nursing practice degree graduated Friday at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences ceremony as the NHS’s first doctoral graduates.
“I know that each of you sitting before me has developed and cultivated really important skills as critical thinkers, as well as a passion for lifelong learning,” Cloonan said. “Those skills and that passion will allow you to step back and to see opportunities and problems in fresh ways, and we’re confident that it will give your days and years quite an extraordinary dimension of creativity to address the challenges that you will find in our health care environment today.”
Shelton, who received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree, encouraged the members of the Class of 2017 to see their potential for world change.
“Each person changes the world; the only question is for better or worse, or to what degree. What if when you left here, you realized that you were a world changer and destined to do great things?” Shelton said.
According to Shelton, belief in oneself is the most powerful tool in realizing great ideas and dreams.
“People often talk about entrepreneurs as being more risk-seeking. However, I think something slightly different,” Shelton said. “I think because they believe in themselves and their plans, they just think the risk is different. Because of that, they do the thing that distinguishes us between entrepreneurs and those of us with great ideas: They do it.”
Shelton closed his remarks by reminding students to strive toward their goals, bearing in mind that life often unfolds in unexpected ways.
“Believe in yourself and your vision, and know that no one is better prepared to write your story than you are. Have faith as you seek to change the world that no matter what is in front of you, what you desire is on the other side,” Shelton said. “You may be surprised at the stories you will write.”

BuzzFeed president Greg Coleman (GSB ’76) advised McDonough School of Business graduates to be courageous in their convictions and to act out of sincere generosity in his commencement address to the Class of 2017 on Saturday.
Coleman, an alumnus of the business school, said making decisions with conviction helps deflect criticism and ensures that your actions reflect your beliefs.
“There are going to be some times and things that you believe in that are unpopular, and you’re going to be called on to defend that choice,” Coleman said. “You’ve got to put your adult pants on, trust your instincts and think it through. Know what you stand for. At the end of the day, the most important person you’re going to answer to is you.”
As an example of this decisive leadership, Coleman cited BuzzFeed News division’s controversial decision to publish a 35-page dossier written by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele containing unverified and explosive allegations related to President Donald Trump and his alleged ties to Russia.
Though other news outlets had been in possession of the dossier for months prior, they had largely declined to report on any of its unconfirmed claims. After CNN and others reported that then-President Barack Obama and Trump had been briefed on its contents, BuzzFeed published the dossier and soon met significant blowback.
“Immediately, the criticism began falling like hail,” Coleman said. “We were accused of shoddy reporting by fellow members of the press, for being sensationalist, for using unverified salacious claims to boost the clicks to our site. President Trump himself even weighed in from his press conference the next day, calling BuzzFeed a ‘failing pile of garbage.’”
In spite of this response, Coleman said BuzzFeed news editor Ben Smith made the appropriate decision based on his belief that releasing the document upheld the news media’s commitment to transparency.
“He made a really tough call. You’re going to have to make tough calls,” Coleman said. “And I’m proud of the courage and thought process that it took for him to do it.”
Acting for the good of others and “spreading good karma,” Coleman said, is more personally fulfilling than any financial success.
“Be one of the good people. We who have the privilege of a Georgetown education have so much to give back. Be generous with your time and talent; don’t just go out and try to make money,” Coleman said. “People never forget kindness.”
“At the end of all of your days, the souls that you’ve touched, the lives that you’ve changed, those generous acts will bring you more peace than any material success that you can imagine.”

Inequality and human suffering can be addressed by activists driven by empathy and care for others, according to Sister Mary Scullion, R.S.M. in her commencement address to the Georgetown College on Healy Lawn on Saturday.
Scullion, who joined the Sisters of Mercy in 1976, is a co-founder of Project HOME, an organization that provides homeless and low-income individuals in Philadelphia with shelter, employment, education and health care. She is also an advocate for those with mental illness and other disabilities.
In her address, she cited Pope Francis’ call for a “revolution of tenderness,” which he made in an April speech on compassion and solidarity to the TED2017 conference in Vancouver, and encouraged the graduates to live a life of caring for others in the face of a growingly impersonal society.
“Whether it’s our brothers and sisters who are living on the streets of this city with such great power or the tens of millions of people around the globe who have become refugees due to economic and political violence, today there is devastating human suffering and dehumanization,” Scullion said. “Today more than ever we need this revolution of tenderness.”
This revolution begins with each of the graduates, Scullion said. Scullion cited the founding of the student group Unsung Heroes by Febin Bellamy (MSB ’17) as a use of the power of interpersonal connection to enact change. The group, founded in Spring 2015, sought to share the stories of on-campus workers. Unsung Heroes began to garner national media attention in October 2016.
“The power of this story is that it gives voice to the very real economic divides that are endemic in American society, and it shows us how this revolution of tenderness is and must be rooted in personal relationships as it seeks to weave new webs of human community and inclusion,” Scullion said. “Amid the challenges of our day, see the human face of those you earnestly seek to help.”
Scullion said the graduates’ education will help empower them to make a positive change in the world.
“Your education can and must play a role in addressing the systemic injustices in these tense and troubling political times,” Scullion said. “We need you, the next generation of leaders, a blend of personal passion, tenderness and practical wisdom that can help us break the paralysis of ideological polarization and the stranglehold of concentrated economic power.”
Scullion then turned to the meaning of education in the lives of students and society. She said education drives the pursuit of social justice.
“True education is transformative and dynamic. The pursuit of truth, mercy and justice never lets us rest. And we won’t rest until we listen for and hear the voices of all, until we are moved to action to address the inequities in our society,” Scullion said. “We need to unite with those struggling to find new paths to economic inclusivity.”
Scullion said she hopes the graduates use their talents to enact change to help those who are struggling.
“We celebrate the accomplishments over these past four years, but I hope and believe that in the coming years, the graduating Class of 2017 will give us much more to celebrate as you use your gifts to nurture that fragile but profound common bond of our humanity,” Scullion said. “I am convinced that seeking to heal the broken world is the true path to a life of wholeness for all of us, as well. We are one.”

A world where education, internationalism and service are increasingly scorned requires experts to address the issues of the future, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and journalist Anne Applebaum told School of Foreign Service graduates at their May 20 commencement ceremony.
Applebaum, a Washington Post columnist and frequent critic of President Donald Trump and the global rise of populism, warned that the values associated with the school have recently come under attack.
“When I first started to think about this speech, a few weeks ago, it suddenly struck me that every phrase in that title, School of Foreign Service, is now under assault in a way that it never has been before — or at least not that I can remember, and I am quite old,” Applebaum said.
The graduating students’ dedication of time, money and effort to pursuing knowledge makes them part of an elite, one that has become more unpopular worldwide in recent years, according to Applebaum. The graduates were “now the enemy,” according to Applebaum.
“After all, people with expertise are small in number. So, it doesn’t matter anymore where you come from, how you got here or how hard you worked to get here — you are now part of an elite, and in some places, you may discover that you are part of an unpopular elite,” Applebaum said.
Without mentioning them by name, Applebaum referenced several world leaders who recently rose to power by riding waves of populism, including Trump and Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte. The latter won with 39% of the vote in a five-candidate field, after running a campaign marked by nationalist fervor.
“In countries all over the world, in Venezuela, the Philippines and Poland, and even in a few places closer to home, political movements have lately proven that it is possible to win an election by running against unpopular elites.”
Applebaum endorsed Trump’s Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in a July column in the Washington Post, saying Trump’s administration would welcome authoritarian leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin. As The Hoya previously reported, Applebaum said Trump is “unfit to be president” in a Post column published May 16.
Applebaum also contended that the resurgence of nationalism in North American, European, and Asian politics has undercut the value of cosmopolitanism and further brought internationalists under scrutiny.
“Around the world, people with an interest in crossing borders, in solving international problems, or in doing international business are now treated with suspicion in some places where they were welcomed only a few years ago,” Applebaum said. “The loyalty of internationalists is now questioned. ‘Globalist’ is now a term of abuse.”
The act of devoting one’s life to working in the public sector has lost esteem, Applebaum said, as antipathy toward government undermines respect for public service.
“Indeed, much of the community doesn’t call them civil servants or public servants, it calls them bureaucrats, as in wasteful bureaucrats, lazy bureaucrats, boring bureaucrats,” Applebaum said.
According to Applebaum, however, work in government has a significant impact.
“The men and women who run the government can determine whether you’ll get an operation that will save your life, whether you can buy a house, whether you will be able to send your son or daughter to a great school like Georgetown,” Applebaum said. “The men and women who run the government can also stop wars or start them, they can rescue refugees or let them die, they can prevent a terrorist attack before it starts or they can turn away and let it happen.”
Applebaum encouraged the SFS graduates never to diminish the value of their education — submitting her defense of the institution whose mission, in her view, faces a global challenge.
“I can’t predict what will happen in the world during the rest of your lifetimes,” Applebaum said. “But I do know that whatever problems the world is going to throw at us, either in the next 10 years or the next 10 minutes, we will need people like you, people who have been to schools of foreign service, to help us solve them.”
