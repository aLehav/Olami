When the former Park51 spokesman visits campus March 1, the planned Islamic community center near Ground Zero that sparked national controversy last fall won’t be on the table for discussion.
Rather, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf is coming to the university to lead a conference on the role of religion in American politics as part of a multi-city tour.
The conference — “Religion in American Politics and Society: A Model for Other Countries?” — will feature three panels of religious experts on Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Each of the speakers will address American attitudes about the relationship between religion and the political and social spheres. They will also comment on how those opinions affect the international community.
A number of distinguished religious figures will be in attendance alongside Rauf, including Archbishop Charles Chaput of Denver and Rabbi David Saperstein, the director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.
Rauf specifically plans to articulate his vision for the future of U.S.-Muslim relations at the lecture. He founded the Cordoba Initiative soon after the 9/11 attacks to bridge what he defines as the U.S.-Muslim world divide.
“We believe that America needs a national discourse around Islam, both domestically and internationally, to heal the perceived divide and the voices that are so in discourse between America and the Islamic world. And I think America is ready for it,” Rauf said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
Rauf argued that the United States has reached an important turning point in its relations with the Muslim world, citing President Obama’s welcoming statements to Muslims in the State of the Union address as proof of the American commitment to religious freedom and tolerance.
These words can become action, Rauf said, and the United States can demonstrate its commitment to improving interreligious relations on an international scale through the ongoing Egyptian conflict.
“What we see right now, in Egypt, is a test of Obama’s Cairo speech which he gave in June of 2009, in which he said he wanted a new beginning with the Muslim world,” Rauf said. “And this is a test of how well this administration is able to engage with Islam internationally, and so far I must say the indications are positive.”.
Ultimately, Rauf said that he hopes that students will understand that interfaith dialogue is vital to politics and society.
“I am very optimistic about the future, and I encourage students, for instance at Georgetown, to learn more about and engage more in Muslim-American interactions and to understand a brighter future that hopefully we will eventually reach one day,” Rauf said.

Visitors to late-night haunt Third Edition will only pass through the establishment’s front door from now on, after noise complaints forced owners to adjust their contract with the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E.
The new entry rules mark a change from past practice, when patrons could pass through the alley leading to the back entrance of the property. The change comes following concerns over noise levels outside the bar, according to ANC Commissioner Jake Sticka (COL ’13).
Officials mulled over the voluntary agreement with Third Edition for several months before it was finalized last week. Voluntary agreements, brokered between the ANC and local bars, set restrictions to ensure the establishments can keep their liquor licenses.
The topic first came up during the ANC’s November meeting after community members bemoaned the noise coming from the alley at closing time. The ANC initially protested the renewal of Third Edition’s liquor license, but the recently passed revisions have neutralized any concerns, according to Sticka.
Though the ANC itself does not have the power to revoke liquor licenses, voluntary agreements with the ANC, which are continually under review, help ensure that bars are able to maintain their liquor licenses.
The owners of another area bar, Prospect Street’s George, are looking to end their voluntary agreement with the ANC on the hours of operation, traffic flow and outdoor seating options, according to ANC Commissioner and Representative to the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration Bill Starrels.
But George’s push to cut off the arrangement has been met by pushback from the ANC, which has requested more time to evaluate the agreement with the bar’s attorney, Starrels said.
Confusion arose at the ANC’s Jan. 31 meeting when owners and patrons of local bar George arrived to defend the establishment’s position on liquor license negotiations but were not allowed to speak due to a scheduling error.
Starrels said that the owners of George want to bump up its capacity from 99 to 200, while the ANC wants to maintain the levels laid out in the standing agreement.
Discussion of a possible voluntary agreement between George and ANC appeared on the meeting’s agenda published online, but the ANC had removed the topic from its budget prior to the meeting, according to Sticka. There can be no discussion until an agreement is drafted, which did not occur before the meeting, he said.
“It would appear that the communication didn’t reach some members,” Sticka said.
Sticka said he empathized with George’s owners, who gave up their night to support the establishment and were subsequently ignored at the meeting.
“We all felt bad about that,” he said.
ANC meetings are held once monthly, and last Monday’s was counted as the meeting for February.
The Citizens Association of Georgetown has announced its support of ANC’s protest of George’s liquor license, as reported in the Georgetown Dish. CAG is specifically worried about the use of George’s outdoor courtyard.
“Like the ANC, we are concerned with the effects on the community from more people in an already saturated area,” CAG President Jennifer Altemus said in an email. “Sound in the courtyard reverberates and carries into the condos and apartments around it.”
CAG has historically worked with the ANC on voluntary agreements for Georgetown’s bars and restaurants, according to Altemus.
Georgetown’s Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration caps liquor licenses available for local establishments at about 1,750.

The number of former Georgetown students spending their time in the Peace Corps rose this year, with a total of 37 alumni serving overseas.
Georgetown’s international focus combined with the university’s strong emphasis on service inspires many to seek out oversees service opportunities, students say.
“I don’t think Georgetown’s rank is surprising at all. The Jesuit education system puts an emphasis on students becoming ‘men and women for others’ — and that is something that the Peace Corps really embodies,” Grace Boyan (SFS ‘14), who is considering joining the Peace Corps, said in an email.
Alison McReynolds, Georgetown’s campus recruiter for the Peace Corps and a former volunteer, agreed.
“I think [joining the Peace Corps] aligns with the mentality of the university and the goals of the students who go there,” she said.
The university ranks 10th in the medium colleges and universities category this year for the number of alumni serving in the Peace Corps. Georgetown fell two places from its eighth position in the medium schools category last year, though the actual number of volunteers has risen from last year’s 30. The George Washington University finished first in the same category for the third year in a row and American University took fourth place. Since the establishment of the Peace Corps in 1961, 845 Georgetown alumni have served as volunteers.
Peace Corps volunteers have a variety of reasons for choosing to work abroad, including learning about different cultures and participating in community development.
Stephen Chapman, the Peace Corps public affairs specialist, said that spending time in a foreign country is valuable.
“I think one of the most interesting things is seeing how people live outside of the United States,” Stephen Chapman said.
Boyan also emphasized the experience of living abroad as a primary reason for joining.
“I think the biggest motivation for me, and maybe for others, is the chance to form connections and build relationships with people and really become a part of a very different type of community by helping them out in any way that I can,” she said.
The Peace Corps recruits from all four undergraduate schools and nearly every major at Georgetown, McReynolds said.
According to Chapman, there is a great deal of diversity in applicant backgrounds because there is such a wide array of jobs available to Peace Corps volunteers. Some possibilities include work in education, youth and community development, health, business, information and communications technology and agriculture.

The GUSA presidential election campaign kicked off at midnight Thursday, beginning a two-week race among four tickets.
On Feb. 24, the student body will have 24 hours to vote for the next Georgetown University Student Association president and vice president, following a campaign period that will include a debate among presidential candidates.
The following pairs announced their candidacy this weekend for the respective positions of president and vice president: former GUSA Senator Ace Factor (COL ’12) and James Pickens (COL ’12); College Academic Council Vice President Jed Feiman (COL ’12) and mens’ basketball center Henry Sims (COL ’12); current member of the GUSA executive cabinet Charlie Joyce (COL ’12) and Paige Lovejoy (SFS ’12); Kristie Kalenka (MSB ’12) and Jared Coppotelli (MSB ’12) and Deputy Chief of Staff Mike Meaney (SFS ’12); and Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair Greg Laverriere (COL ’12).
In a statement to The Hoya, Factor said he and Pickens’ aims were threefold: to create a student advocacy office to inform students of their rights; to boost community service efforts among students and Jesuits; and to increase GUSA’s transparency.
“We hope by campaigning and pushing these issues to bring GUSA back to its intended purpose: to represent student interests here on the Hilltop,” Factor said.
Feiman said that his campaign ticket hopes to bring a unique perspective to the table.
“Henry and I are two student leaders from very different areas in the Georgetown community, and we’ve come together to unite the campus,” Feiman said. “Our opponents remind us …of the same GUSA candidates year after year, and we think we offer something new.”
Citing his experience in GUSA, Joyce (COL’12) said he would work to cut down on red tape and enhance student life.
“My time in GUSA has given me a thorough understanding of relationships between students, the administration, and the community,” Joyce said. “Over time, I have realized that there are many areas where policy and processes at Georgetown should be streamlined. I will help make student life at Georgetown easier, so that students can focus on their academic and extra-curricular endeavors without distraction.”
Kalenka and Coppotelli, both former high school class presidents, said safety and space would be the central issues of their campaign.
“We want to further improve what GUSA has already done. We would like to improve campus safety, and find the best way to utilize all the buildings on campus to maximize student group space,” Kalenka said.
Meaney said he looked to capitalize on his experience in the GUSA executive staff combined withLaverriere’s time in the senate.
“Georgetown students need representatives who think creatively and will work hard to implement solutions to fix the many issues facing students,” Meaney said. “Through my experience with the executive and Greg’s in the Senate, as well as our involvement outside of GUSA, we have a proving record of making innovative ideas become reality. We want to take these skills to the next level so we can continuing serving our fellow students.”
Director of Student Programs, Erika Cohen-Derr, attended the two informational sessions held this weekend for candidates and spoke to the novelty of this particular race, which will elect the successors to Calen Angert (MSB ’11) and Jason Kluger (MSB ’11); the two who have been at the helm of GUSA for two years.
“I am looking forward to the chance for another generation of students to continue the work of thoughtful advocacy that Calen and Jason have focused on for the last two years,” Cohen-Derr said. “GUSA provides a very important mechanism to involve students in the governance of the university — the campaign season is a perfect opportunity for the student body to learn how each set of prospective executive teams would best represent their interests and prioritize their needs.”
This campaign season, candidates are required to present a prospective budget for their year in office. The budget would include the expenses for GUSA Senate, the executive committee and any programs the candidates propose.
Campaigners are limited to a $300 budget and 150 fliers that can be posted in public spaces at any given time. The commission said that candidates may campaign door to door and residents can agree to post fliers on their own doors. According to Election Commissioner Adam Giansiracusa(SFS ’12), candidates may also post in residence halls under separate policies.
Angert, the outgoing president, said he was excited to see the election process begin.
“Jason and I have had a great run, but now it’s time for someone else to take the reins,” Angertsaid. “It’s bittersweet — I’ve enjoyed my time, but I’m ready to have more of my own time to pursue other interests.”

Members of the D.C. Council earn the second-highest salaries of local representatives in major cities nationwide, according to a recent report from The Pew Charitable Trusts.
The Pew report compared the councils of 15 cities nationwide, including the 10 largest,  and averaged all of the members’ salaries. In D.C., the average was $130,538, falling second to the average salary of Los Angeles’ councilors, who earn an average of $178,789 per year.
The 12 regular members of the D.C. Council earn $125,583 per year, while Council Chairman Kwame R. Brown’s salary is $190,000.
According to the Pew report, the D.C. Council also spends the most money — $32.41 per resident — of all the cities included in the study. The District faces a $600 million deficit for next year.
Among cities studied, however, D.C. is unique in that it functions as a city, county and state, possibly accounting for its higher spending, according to the Pew report.
Councilmember Phil Mendelson (D-At Large) said the expanded role of a sitting member of the D.C. Council merited the current pay scale.
“Elected officials’ salaries are paid with public dollars and therefore are fair game for the attention they are getting,” Mendelson said in an email. “Most councilmembers work full time as council members and have broader responsibility than any other legislator in the country …. Thus, our salaries are comparable to other full-time, professional positions.”
In 2006 the council reformulated the schedule of salaries in the District, upping the mayor’s salary to $200,000. Since the councilmembers’ salaries are tied to the mayor’s, their salaries increased as well, according to Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2).
Evans said that the D.C. salaries are similar to those of other cities, such as New York, which pays councilors $121,725 per year and ranked third in the Pew report.
“Even the Pew study showed that they’re all about the same,” Evans said.
The Pew report also mentioned that while councilmembers designated as part time tended to get lower salaries than full-time council members, this was not the case for the District’s councilmembers. The report acknowledged that the distinction between part time and full-time members is not necessarily telling about how much time the council spends doing its job.

In an attempt to capitalize on the prevalence of online connections, the Department of Labor launched a website last week that gives job-seekers free access to thousands of possible positions.
Called My Next Move, the site allows potential workers to browse their job options by keyword or industry. It also allows users who are unsure of their career goals to determine their interests and narrow their focus onto certain jobs.
The website provides a 60 question survey through a database called O*NET that determines the jobseeker’s interests and eligibility. The tool further breaks down career fields by allowing users to search for jobs in three different categories: Bright Outlook, Green and Registered Apprenticeship.
Careers labeled as Bright Outlook are ones that are expected to grow quickly in the next few years and provide large numbers of market openings, according to the site.
Careers that fall into the Green category are careers that will be changed by the green economy, either by creating more demand or changing the skills needed for certain jobs or by creating new career fields altogether.
Registered Apprenticeships – paid internships fall in this category – consist of short-term options that enable employees to train for jobs, get hands-on experience and earn money simultaneously.
My Next Move is a complement to the Department’s mySkills myFuture website, launched on Labor Day last year, which aids experienced workers in finding new careers.
“This administration is committed to expanding opportunities for all Americans,” Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis said in a press release. “That includes ensuring all workers — those with years of experience and those just entering the workforce — have the information they need to make informed career decisions and get good jobs.”
Some Georgetown students are unsure of how the website will reach the general population.
“I don’t think I would have that website as my main source if I needed a job, but I assume that if you’re unemployed in this economy you would use any source you can,” Nick Albanese (SFS ’14) said. “I don’t think I would use it … There are other services that do the same things, like Monster and things.”
Solis stressed that the site could be helpful, however.
“My Next Move will help those seeking career guidance learn more about work opportunities in fields that are of interest to them and that are likely to have job openings today and well into the future,” Solis said.

Likening American academia to a rusty automobile industry, government professor Mark Rom argued that University Provost James O’Donnell’s call for an academic review gives Georgetown a chance to improve by taking stock of its past highs and lows.
As Georgetown prepares for its 10-year reaccreditation procedure, the Office of the Provost is offering monetary support to departments willing to assist the university in conducting a self-assessment.
Every 10 years, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education — an organization that accredits schools in the Middle States region — mandates a self-study review that examines the university’s accomplishments across a number of areas. Student learning, institutional operations, general education and planning and resource allocation all fall under the MSC’s purview. In order to gain accreditation from the organization — which is necessary for the University’s operation — Georgetown has to demonstrate that it is maintaining the standards imposed by the MSC.
To encourage departments to take part in the extensive self-study, the Office of the Provost recently sent a memorandum to all of the departments and academic programs offering grants of up to $8,000 to support program-level assessments. Departments will use the funds to finance projects that analyze and apply information regarding student learning.
Randall Bass, English professor and faculty co-chair of the accreditation review team, said that including academic departments, rather than just the administration, is an important component of the self-evaluation, particularly when it comes to gauging student learning.
“We believe that the first principle of student learning is that it should be a concern of all programs and departments, and it shouldn’t come from the top down,” Bass said.
A number of academic departments already have systems in place to measure student learning.
For over 20 years, the department of biology has asked graduating seniors to take a test to measure learning that may not appear on the GRE. The department’s test includes questions that measure the seniors’ analytical skills and knowledge. The science, technology and international affairs major encourages students to maintain electronic portfolios where they can write how different elements of their undergraduate education have helped them obtain the goals of their major. Other departments are looking into implementing similar programs.
While the grants offered by the provost may be applied to programs that are already in place, the Georgetown accreditation review team hopes that departments will also take advantage of the offer by proposing new internal assessment programs.
Rom plans to submit a proposal that will evaluate the four introductory courses in the department by issuing student-assessment surveys at the beginning and end of the semester, instead of only at the completion of the course. Rom also wants to examine the syllabuses of different courses across the department and look for ways they relate to one another in order to improve the inter-class learning experience within the department.
The provost’s initiative comes following the release of “Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses,” a book that argues students are failing to improve in areas such as writing and critical thinking. Citing statistics from the Collegiate Learning Assessment, the book states that 36 percent of students do not demonstrate significant improvement in learning during their entire undergraduate career.
Bass said that the CLA is not an appropriate tool to measure all levels of student learning, but he still believes that universities should work more to improve students’ writing and critical thinking skills.
Rom said that a reevaluation of teaching methods may also be in order.
“I think that in some ways American universities are like American car companies in the 1970s,” Rom said. “We’ve always been No. 1, we think we make a great product, and we get kind of, not lazy, but we have the idea that what we’ve done in the past is good enough, and we ought to keep doing that.”
In order to actively battle complacency, reinvention is key according to Rom.
“I think universities, including Georgetown, need to really focus on how we can improve what we’re doing.”
