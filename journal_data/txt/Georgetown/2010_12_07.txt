The Georgetown University Student Association’s reform of the Student Activities Fee and Endowment passed this morning after a three-day student body referendum, overhauling the amount and allocation of the charge for the first time since 2001.
Under the new system, the $100 Student Activities Fee will see a gradual hike, first to $125 next academic year, and later to $150 starting the 2012-2013 school year.
Though the charge is now diverted equally to club funding and an endowment originally intended to provide clubs with sustainability in the long term, next fall will mark a change in allocation – 100 percent of the Student Activities Fee will be devoted to funding for clubs and activities at Georgetown. The Student Activities Endowment will no longer accrue any revenue from the fee.
By doubling the current allocation for next fall’s funding, several GUSA leaders believe the impact will be substantial.
“[In my time with GUSA] I think this is the single biggest initiative that has passed . I selfishly am sad that I won’t be here to witness it,” GUSA Vice President Jason Kluger (MSB ’11) said.
Adding to the sentiment, GUSA Senate Speaker Adam Mortillaro (COL ’12) said the effects of the overhaul would be wide-reaching.
“The students of Georgetown have spoken clearly to take the Hilltop community further,” Mortillaro said. “[SAFE reform] will enhance and improve the quality of student life at Georgetown.”
The Student Activities Endowment, which will receive no funding from the fee as of next fall, was instated in 2001 by a GUSA-initiated student body vote. Ushered in with the $100 Student Activities Fee, the endowment was originally intended to hit $10 million dollars by now. Today, however, it remains stagnant at $2 million, according to members of the GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee, who attribute the lagging growth of the endowment to the university reneging on a promise to contribute $3 million when the referendum passed.
Fin/App Committee Chair Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) said GUSA plans on working out the future of the endowment sometime this spring, potentially during the Spring Budget Summit. “It’s going to take a longer discussion. Next semester we’ll start looking into that,” he said.
At the Budget Summit, GUSA plans to determine the level of funding each advisory board will receive, according to Laverriere.
The Election Commission reported 1,703 students – about 70 percent of voters – clicked “yes” in the online poll that launched shortly before 10 p.m. Monday and closed at midnight this morning. The final tally of 2,446 votes surpassed the predetermined 2,000-vote threshold needed to validate the referendum’s outcome.
GUSA leaders attributed the turnout and victory both to their own campaigning and to student groups. GUSA members could be seen flyering in high-traffic areas like O’Donovan Hall and Lauinger Library over the past few days. Many student groups sent out messages to their membership encouraging them to vote in the referendum.
Students had mixed feelings about the effectiveness of GUSA’s campaign, however.
\”I doubt I would have heard about it had GUSA not pushed for it,\” Malin Hu (SFS ’11) said.\”It seemed there was a reasonable case for increasing the fee [so I voted for it].\”
But Youngho Chun (SFS ’13) said that he had not been aware of the proposed fee overhaul. \”I didn’t open the emails they sent,\” he said, adding that voting in person would have been more effective. \”None of my friends talked about it, I didn’t really know about it.\”
Campaign Manager Fitz Lufkin (COL ’11) said he believes the results are only the beginning of greater changes for student groups.
“It’s a victory for ideas, a paradigm shift . [Clubs] can now stop thinking how to get by .” he said.
“The influx of money has an unknown potential to benefit student life,” Fin/App Committee Vice Chairman Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) added. Fin/App Chair Laverriere also stated that the increase in funding would open doors to improved speakers, facilities, and concerts, drawing more prospective students to the Hilltop.
“I really look forward to seeing what the leaders of organizations look to do with this,” Lufkin said.
One of the driving forces behind the reform in his capacity as chair of the Fin/App Committee, Laverriere stressed the change that would come from this referendum. “Students will see an immediate effect.”

As U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks continue to create shockwaves in the international community, Georgetown students looking to futures in diplomacy face advice urging them not to discuss the documents on social media sites.
After a tip from an alumnus working in the State Department, Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs’ Office of Career Services issued an email late last Tuesday cautioning students against posting anything about the leaks on personal media like Facebook and Twitter.
“Engaging in these activities would call into question your ability to deal with confidential information, which is part of most positions with the federal government,” the email said, according to The New York Times.
Later that week, Dean of SIPA John Coatsworth stated in a second email to students that they have the right to discuss the scandal, retracting the initial Career Office email.
The documents have been a major topic of discussion at Georgetown, with students seeming unconcerned about posting about the leaks.
“All my friends are discussing it profoundly with a lot of excitement and agitation,” Sara Moufarrij (SFS ’12) said. “It’s very terrifying and interesting. It makes you rethink the way politics is conducted.”
With many aspiring diplomats enrolled in the School of Foreign Service, administrators have responded to students who want to ensure a fair shot at a career.
“Our advice to students – about anything that any future employer might see – has always been that whatever they blog about or post to Facebook could be accessible publicly and available permanently,” SFS Dean Carol Lancaster (SFS ’64) said in an email. “We do think this is a learning moment; students should certainly be keeping up with news reports on the issue and thinking about what the implications are for diplomacy going forward.”
After asking the dean’s office to consider issuing an official statement on the ordeal, the SFS Academic Council is now hoping to educate students in the next couple weeks about appropriate responses to the leaks, Council President Josh Mogil (SFS ’11) said.
The Career Education Center has yet to take an official stance on the issue, but generally warns Georgetown students to be careful about their social media use.
“The Career Education Center has not cautioned students about posting WikiLeaks-related information on their social media pages,” Director Mike Schaub said in an email. “However, this would be a good time to remind students to be thoughtful and judicious about their social media posts. Students must keep in mind that employers are increasingly using social media to vet job candidates.”
During a Career Education
Center-sponsored government week session with a variety of State Department and CIA officials earlier this semester, representatives from various government sectors warned against social media use, specifically for students seeking State Department internships. Students said that they understood the concerns, and did not want to risk their chances through lack of foresight.
“It’s already tough enough to get those internships. The last thing you need is [to post] a status update or something,” Evan Smith (SFS ’14) said. “This information isn’t any less sensitive now that it’s been leaked. Some of this stuff really is sensitive, and if you’re interested in diplomacy and the State Department then that’s something you should understand.”
Ali Soroush (NHS ’12) disagreed.
“I’m not looking to work in government, so I’m not affected by the [possible] warnings,” he said. “But I think we need to have public discourse about foreign policy. . Just because the State Department wants it to be classified doesn’t mean it is. It’s out in the open now.”

Abelardo Hernando, an adjunct assistant professor in the Spanish and Portuguese department for over 15 years, died of lung cancer last Wednesday.
According to an email from the Office of the Provost, Hernando died in the care of hospice, while accompanied by family and friends, after falling ill last spring. He did not teach at Georgetown this fall.
According to Alfonso Morales-Front, chair of the department of Spanish and Portuguese, Hernando began feeling ill last spring but continued to teach through the end of the semester. The lung cancer diagnosis came as a surprise, especially since Hernando did not have a history of cancer-causing behaviors.
“He never smoked. He was never in a place that we can assume was bad for his health,” Morales-Front said.
Hernando worked for over 15 years in the department of Spanish and Portuguese, where he gained a reputation among faculty and students as a passionate and amicable teacher who cared deeply for his students.
According to Michael Ferreira, assistant professor in the Spanish and Portuguese department, Hernando’s students held him in high regard.
“I passed by his classroom frequently and it always struck me that despite teaching past the scheduled time, no one would get up and leave until he was finished,” Ferreira said in an email. “I always sensed respect and gratitude from his students in their interactions with him.”
Laurel Charnetsky (COL ’12), who took Hernando’s class “Latin American Contemporary Short Stories,” said that, with Hernando, the respect was mutual.
“He treated us like responsible adults and very much cared about our input and appreciation for the material,” she said. “He was also extremely kind and understanding.”
The College Academic Council commended Hernando last year after students nominated him as one of the most influential professors in the department.
“He was a great person, a great guy,” Morales-Front said. “He was very quiet – the kind of person that when you meet him, he is always in a good mood, always had something good to say about everyone.”
Hernando’s wake was held on Dec. 3 in Bethesda, Md., and his funeral service was held Sunday in Clarksburg, Md.
“I was, yesterday, at the wake, and I saw many of his students. That’s what they were all telling me – that he was just a great teacher,” Morales-Front said.

Family planning has gone digital with the recent release of Cycle Technologies’ iCycleBeads, an application for Apple products that allows women to track their menstrual cycles on their iPhones, iPods and iPads.
iCycleBeads follows a woman’s menstrual cycle, helping women avoid pregnancy or aiding in their attempts to become pregnant by identifying their days of fertility and infertility.
According to Leslie Heyer, president of Cycle Technologies, the application is meant to facilitate natural family planning.
“iCycleBeads allows a woman to both plan and prevent pregnancy easily and effectively without in-depth tracking of complicated data, a counselor to review information or requiring additional tools to help her use it,” Heyer said.
Cycle Technologies, a company licensed by Georgetown University, works directly with the Georgetown University Institute for Reproductive Health (GUIRH). The new application was inspired by Cycle Technologies’ original CycleBeads product, which is a circular set of beads with which women can track their menstrual cycles by moving one bead each day along a rubber ring.
The iPhone application, which costs $2.99, claims to allow women an easier, more accessible way to follow their cycles. Women input the start date of their last menstrual period, and the application then identifies and tracks where the woman is in her current cycle and when her most fertile days will be.
This information is presented in calendar format or by a virtual representation of color-coded CycleBeads. A red box or circle represents the first day of a woman’s period, white represents days when the female is the most fertile and brown signifies the days when pregnancy is least likely.
Heyer said that the app was designed after feedback from the original product suggested that an electronic alternative would be effective.
“Through our work with CycleBeads, we’ve received a lot of feedback over the years, and we had a good idea of how to make this app as user friendly as possible,” Heyer said in an email. “We also understood how to translate the method on which CycleBeads are based into an app. We did show it to our colleagues at the Institute for Reproductive Health at Georgetown University to get their feedback before we introduced it.”
So far, the application has received near-perfect reviews, with a five-star product rating on the Apple iTunes Store.
“The feedback so far has been great,” Heyer said, adding that the alerts are one of the most popular features of the application.
“People love the alerts – the alert that let’s them know if they are in different stages of their cycle or if their cycles, reminding them to input their cycle data, or letting them know if they are having a cycle that is too short or too long to use the method correctly,” Heyer wrote.
Designed for women who have typical cycles – cycles that are between 26 and 32 days long – the application takes into account the 24-hour life span of a woman’s egg and the five-day life span of sperm, as well as the actual timing of ovulation each month.
The iCycleBeads application is currently available only on iTunes, though Heyer says that may change in the future.
“We’re also getting requests to make this available on other devices, so we are exploring that,” Heyer said.

Polls for a referendum on Student Activities Fee and Endowment reform went live Monday evening, yielding 741 student votes at press time. For GUSA senators, a publicity drive to reach their magic number of 2,000 participants is in full swing.
 
The voting push comes as students face a measure that would increase the $100 Student Activities Fee to $150 over the next two years, which would lead to a major expansion in money available to student groups.
 
 
The Georgetown University Student Association bill would also halt contributions to the Student Activities Endowment, which is intended to be a reservoir for club spending in the long term. GUSA’s proposal would instead allocate all fee revenue to clubs’ funding needs. Under the current system, half of the fee income is set aside for the endowment, while the other half is earmarked for student organizations.
 
The campaign push for reform, led by campaign manager Fitz Lufkin (COL ’11), features a 4-by-8 foot banner in Red Square, extensive flyering and door-knocking, among other measures.
 
 
 
“We have a pretty comprehensive start,” Lufkin said. “We are going all out for three days, but we’ve been working on it for a few weeks. We are trying to engage as much of the student body as possible.”
 
 
 
Lufkin and GUSA Senate Speaker Adam Mortillaro (COL ’12) said they have not heard much of a negative response so far.
 
“We feel very confident. Right now [as of 10 p.m. Monday] we have people door-knocking . So far in the people I’ve been talking to I’ve been getting positive reactions,” Mortillaro said.
 
 
 
Since GUSA cannot allocate any money from its budget for its pro-SAFE campaigning, senators and outside sources have paid for the marketing out of their own pockets. “We didn’t want to use student funds for a political campaign,” Mortillaro said.
 
 
 
Once the online polls opened, GUSA senators stormed high-traffic study areas, such as Lauinger Library, the Rafik B. Hariri Building and Sellinger Lounge in order to galvanize the on-the-ground support needed to reach the coveted threshold of 2,000 votes. The online polls will close at midnight on Thursday evening.
 
 
 
Since one-fourth of the undergraduate population is around 1,800 students, GUSA senators rounded off to 2,000 students as a benchmark for sufficient participation to legitimize the referendum, according to Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair Greg Laverriere (COL ’12). If the referendum draws enough voters, the Election Commission will then determine whether or not the reform has passed based on the voting majority.
 
 
 
When Laverriere and other senators approached students to discuss SAFE reform, he said that many prospective voters were skeptical at first.
 
 
 
“However, once you started discussing the reform with them they start to understand it, and there have been positive responses,” Laverriere said.
 
 
 
Laverriere also said that he was cautiously optimistic about hitting the 2,000-vote target.
 
 
 
“We are approaching a lot of people – knocking on doors. We have the added benefit of seeing how many votes are cast online. While we can’t see the breakdown, [the number of those in favor or against], we can at least see that if we have 1,500 votes, we know we need to go out there and try to get the remaining 500,” Laverriere said.
 
 
 
According to Fin/App Committee Vice Chairman Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), social networking has been a powerful tool in the campaign.
 
 
 
“Facebook has been big in getting student responses,” Malkerson said.
 
 
 
The SAFE reform “Vote Now and Vote Yes on SAFE Reform!” Facebook page has served as a forum for students to air out their opinions both in favor of and against the measure. At press time, about 499 users were confirmed attendees of the event.
 
 
 
In the past, student referendums have been met with a mixed turnout. In 2001, 25 percent of students voted on the Student Activities Endowment, which would be left dormant if the ongoing referendum is passed. In 2002, 35.5 percent of students voted on the Yard referendum, which proposed to rework the structure and constitution of GUSA. The resounding majority of those voters cast their ballots against the motion. Voter turnout hit a peak in 2006 when about 50 percent of students turned out to vote on the GUSA constitution and overhaul of the structure of the student association, with the majority of voters affirming the reform.
 
 
 
In recent GUSA Senate election voting, however, voter apathy seems to have cast a shadow on participation levels. In the lowest turnout rate of the September GUSA vote, 5.5 percent of residents cast ballots for the Village A E-H district senate race.
 
Some students said they thought the Student Activities Fee’s current structure should stay the same and that it was up to the clubs themselves to raise any supplementary funds.
 
 
 
“I do not think that the Student Activities Fee should increase by the standard rate of inflation or be increased in general,” Paulina Sosa (COL ’13) said. “Yes, some of the clubs on campus are underfunded. However, it is the responsibility of these clubs to fundraise. What about the students who do not attend events that the SAFE goes to fund or participate in clubs? They are essentially paying for something that they don’t use.”
 
 
 
Other students said that SAFE reform would be a welcome change, by bringing what they saw as a much-needed funding boost to various clubs.
 
 
 
“I will be voting `yes’ on SAFE reform this week,” Running Club member Sharanbir Grewal (SFS ’13) said. “Given the current level of funding, club sports are forced to either have few away games or charge ridiculously high membership fees. SAFE reform will allow for more people to participate in club sports and allow these clubs to put their skills to the test with more competitions.”
 
For Eliz Hale (COL ’14), scrimping on student group finances is not an option.
 
 
 
“I totally support SAFE reform, and I can’t believe that anyone would oppose it. Clubs are really in need of funding, and it’s the clubs that build a sense of community on campus.”
 
 
 
In light of such a wide-sweeping reform, Mortillaro stressed the need for an end to low voting totals.
 
 
 
“I encourage people to vote yes but at the very least to vote . [SAFE reform] impacts everything on this Hilltop,” he said.
 
 
 
According to Lufkin, GUSA will be working to ensure voters’ participation until the very end.
 
 
 
“We’ll be working right up until it closes . every vote counts,” Lufkin said.
 
 
 
Until the polls close online Thursday at midnight, the Election Commission will count votes on a rolling basis every 12 hours. The next results will be released today at noon. See THE HOYA on Twitter for updates.

Mirroring national trends, Georgetown has seen a 10 percent increase in those studying abroad over the past five years, and an even greater increase in those studying abroad during the summer, according to Laurie Monarch, director of overseas studies.
According to a study by the Institute of International Education released Nov. 15, students nationwide are now choosing shorter, less expensive study abroad programs, a trend also manifesting itself at Georgetown. Monarch said the increase could be attributed to lower costs of summer programs and students’ desire to remain on campus during the year.
Patricia Kehoe (SFS ’12) spent six weeks this summer in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
“I chose a summer program because I wanted to experience study abroad without missing out on important D.C. opportunities like internships,” she said.
Finance is a strong factor, according to Monarch, who said the average cost of a semester abroad matches the tab of Georgetown tuition, while summer program costs are significantly lower.
OIP also works closely with the Office of Student Financial Services to ensure that assured financial aid transfers over when students go abroad. Because Georgetown students pay home tuition for study abroad, financial aid is more easily transferable at Georgetown than at other universities, according to Monarch. The Office of Student Financial Services receives budgets from OIP and is able to keep family costs for a semester abroad about the same as tuition on the main campus.
onarch also cited many Georgetown students’ focus on international studies as a factor in constant study abroad interest.
“I think the primary [factor] is the curricular connection for study abroad,” she said. “When you look at the international character of the university . there are large numbers of students who are naturally, for lack of a better way to put it, attracted to study abroad and already come to Georgetown . with an interest in studying overseas and in international affairs.”
Despite a slight dip in the number of students studying abroad at Georgetown from the 2008-2009 academic year to the 2009-2010 academic year, the university has remained relatively immune to the poor economic situation and its impact on students studying abroad nationwide, while other universities are still reporting declines in students abroad. But Georgetown’s fluctuation in the number of students abroad also matches national trends on a larger scale.
In the 2008-2009 academic year, the number of students studying abroad nationwide fell for the first time in the 25 years that the Institute of International Education has been crunching these numbers. Yet, according to the Forum on Education Abroad, students studying abroad increased again for the 2009-2010 academic year.
The university has also seen a significant increase in the number of students studying in the Middle East, according to Monarch. She said that OIP added two new programs in the Middle East in the past three years – one in Jordan as well as a summer program in Egypt – due to an increased interest in Arabic and Middle Eastern studies at Georgetown.
Additionally, more students studied abroad in the fall than will in the spring for the first time in three academic years, according to Monarch. She attributed this increase partly to the Bologna process, in which European universities are standardizing calendars. Now, more students are able to study abroad at certain universities in countries like France, Spain and the United Kingdom because their semester schedules are more closely aligned with those at American universities.
ultiple students said they studied abroad in the fall so that they would not miss out on certain city and campus events in D.C.
“I love everything that goes on during the spring at Georgetown, and I have several good friends who are a year older than me, so I didn’t want to miss their last semester and graduation,” Laurel Charnetsky (COL ’12), who is currently studying at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, said in an email.

The Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship is prepared to undertake two major projects after receiving a $3 million grant from the Charles Engelhard Foundation earlier this semester.
Director of the CNDLS Randall Bass explained that the funds, which were received at the end of August, have allowed the university to establish a new Institute for the Study of Engaged Learning, as well as continue to redesign courses and fund its popular Engelhard Project.
The ISEL, which will meet annually at Georgetown, includes faculty, staff and alumni from 53 universities, colleges and educational organizations around the country. The institute seeks to address ways in which educators can advance the study of engaged learning, which is an approach to education that emphasizes more personal student interaction with the subject matter than would be present in a traditional approach.
“The ISEL will be a forum for studying the evidence of such learning across typical academic boundaries and thinking long term about how to enhance opportunities for truly transformative learning,” Bass said.
The first ISEL meeting is currently scheduled for June.
The CNDLS also plans to introduce design seminars this spring in which students, faculty and alumni will work together to imagine new course experiences, especially in emerging fields like bioethics, Bass explained.
“We already have the infrastructure support and ethos that enable us to create a space for inventing new forms of curriculum. Now we have some flexibility with resources,” Bass said.
In addition to its new programs, the CNDLS will allocate funds toward Georgetown’s Engelhard Project, which explores ways to engage students by integrating heath and community issues into the regular academic curriculum. The project has enabled over 140 Engelhard classes to be taught in 26 departments since the project’s inception in 2005.
“The connection between academic topics and personal health issues has been a powerful one for the students involved,” said Todd Olson, vice president for student affairs.
James Sandefur, professor of mathematics at Georgetown, teaches an Engelhard course that incorporates health and social issues into the mathematics curriculum.
“My experience has been that we approach these topics from a different angle than students have seen before, and as a result, we get the students’ attention,” he said about his Engelhard class.
In addition to increasing his students’ interest in mathematics, Sandefur said that the non-judgmental approach to health issues promoted in the class had a noticeable difference impact on students.
“[The class] brings about subtle but positive changes in students’ behavior. As one student said, `The unit on alcohol did not change my drinking habits, but I now keep count of how many drinks I have had.'”
Students who have been through the program have been similarly enthusiastic.
Sarah Jones (COL ’09), who took multiple Engelhard courses, speaks highly of the project.
“The Engelhard Project is an incredible initiative that genuinely seeks to wholly engage students,” she said. “I was not learning just for the sake of a grade or a degree but for my personal growth and development.”

Twice a year, Georgetown students register for classes, among them a host of general education requirements. But a select group of students and faculty are working behind the scenes to change these mandated classes.
 
The last 25 years have seen various attempts to change the core curricula of Georgetown’s four schools, but the current attempt spearheaded by theology professor Fr. Christopher Steck S.J., and Randy Bass, executive director and assistant provost for teaching and learning initiatives with the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, is bringing the discussion to the Georgetown community.
 
 
 
The two have partnered to create both a faculty committee on general education and a weekly seminar for seniors, each intended to foster discussion on curricular change. They hope to propose concrete changes by 2014.
 
 
 
Ideas currently under consideration include a series of discussions and lectures for freshmen that would serve as an introduction to Georgetown’s background, its Jesuit identity and the importance of the liberal arts, as well as a general education class for seniors in which they would reflect on their intellectual and personal development during their time at Georgetown. One suggestion well-received by the administration that has been discussed in the seminar proposes that the core curriculum become more interdisciplinary, following the examples of the Liberal Arts Seminar and the Engelhard program.
 
 
 
The LAS previously fulfilled two humanities and writing, two history, one philosophy and one theology requirement in a comprehensive seminar format that has previously been open to freshmen in the College. It is currently on hiatus. Similarly, the Engelhard program works to integrate engaged learning practices in a variety of subjects across the curriculum.
 
 
 
Steck also hopes to incorporate themes including public speaking, diversity and Jesuit identity in a similar manner. He stressed, however, that the discussions on reworking the curriculum do not condemn the current system, but instead are intended to create a greater understanding behind the purpose of the requirements.
 
 
 
“It’s not a criticism of what we’re doing in the courses. I think we’re doing a lot of great things, but part of it is to clarify what the rationale is for these courses, so that we can continue to improve them,” Steck said.
 
 
 
Every Sunday, ten seniors gather for a one-credit seminar to discuss these and other changes. A desire for improvement is what initially led some students to approach Steck and Bass, who decided to use this opportunity to make sure their curriculum improvements spoke to a wider audience than just faculty.
 
 
 
Steck’s seminar is an attempt to combine faculty evaluations with feedback from students who have explored – and sometimes been constrained by – the core curriculum in order to pinpoint the importance of these classes in the average undergraduate’s academic experience and personal growth on the Hilltop.
 
 
 
“What we’re trying to do now is figure out first what the goals are and if there are ways we can develop as alternatives to students to meet these needs,” Steck said in an interview with THE HOYA. “We’re requiring [these courses] for students, so we’re saying there is something here that is so important that the university wants to require every student that goes through the university to take these kinds of courses.”
 
 
 
In the seminar, the seniors discuss much more than concrete changes by debating the value of varying approaches of advisers, pedagogy, and extracurricular and curricular activities, according to Fitz Lufkin (COL ’11), a student in the course. At the end of the semester, the students will help construct a document that details the strengths and weaknesses of Georgetown’s curriculum and suggest changes.
 
 
 
The faculty committee is also working to help students better understand the relationship among the subjects that make up the core curriculum. The committee crafted a survey earlier this year that was distributed to all university juniors and seniors in early November in order to gauge students’ experiences, both positive and negative, with the core curriculum.
 
 
 
As of Thursday, approximately 900 students – 25 percent of those contacted – had responded to the survey, which will remain open through the second week of December, according to a CNDLS blog post.
 
 
 
“With the general education survey that has gone out to upperclassmen, it is exciting to see that student feedback and opinion is being given equal weight,” Lufkin said. “After all, we students are the consumers of a Georgetown education, and what we have to say should be taken seriously.”
 
 
 
The survey results are being used as a basis for discussion in focus groups during the past five days. Each focus group is being led by the students in the seminar and the input gleaned will be used together with the questionnaire and the class discussions to draft the final outline of the new core curriculum.
 
 
 
“Conversations have ranged from general education to class size and everything in between,” Lufkin said. “In general, participants have been frustrated [by] large and disengaging classes, requirements that aren’t flexible enough and the desire for some common educational experience and more interdisciplinary opportunities.”
 
 
 
Student frustration with the curriculum presents a significant challenge for the university in its evaluation of the general education requirements. Students bemoaned problems that range from difficulties grappling with the wide breadth of material presented in a general, introductory course to a lack of understanding of a class’ importance. Students often view requirements as a necessary evil.
 
“As a bio major, to lighten the load, they let us out of the social studies requirement, but out of all five [areas of study], that is the one I am most interested to take,” Jennifer Purks (COL ’14) said. “I wish they would let us choose what we [have] to drop. I don’t think [the general education requirements are] unnecessary. I’m just not looking forward to taking them.”
 
 
 
Steck said that he was aware of such concerns, which prompting his campaign.
 
 
 
“One of the frustrations with students is that they express over and over again, is that they don’t know why they’re taking these courses,” Steck said. “[Students] experience these courses as these discrete hoops to jump through that don’t always have as much connection as you’d think.”
 
 
 
Katie Ryba (MSB ’13) echoed Steck’s concerns and said she lacked guidance.
 
 
 
“I haven’t enjoyed [general education requirements] that much. I didn’t know what classes would be good, what classes would be bad,” she said.
 
 
 
As a result of Ryba’s and other students’ stories, the committee and seminar have developed a variety of methods to combat the student challenges and stigma associated with the core curriculum. Most importantly, the university is working to diversify how it defines the general education requirements.
 
 
 
“All these things are trying to do something important to the discipline they are representing, but the question is [if] there [is] some rationale that is broader than one discipline,” Steck said.
 
 
 
For Steck, the key to Georgetown’s core curriculum is its ability to foster the university’s Jesuit identity. He hopes that the Georgetown Catholic foundation can be addressed in a variety of disciplines in the curriculum.
 
 
 
“There’s something richer about the Jesuit educational tradition, the Catholic intellectual tradition than what can simply be approached in the theology courses,” he said. “Theology courses are important for that, but there are issues that the Jesuit educational tradition is concerned about, issues of justice, of ethics, of formation, of growth. It would be a shame to have them limited to just theology and philosophy.”
 
 
 
The current core of the general education requirements for all of Georgetown’s schools – two humanities, two philosophy and two theology courses – has been in place since 1985. Changes to the core curriculum have been discussed every two to three years since 1994, yet little progress has been made.
 
 
 
An outline draft of ideas resulted from the latest conversation, “A Call to Action: Curriculum and Learning At Georgetown,” in March 2009, although no further steps were taken. Thus far, all changes to the general education requirements have been internal through restructuring of the classes themselves.
 
 
 
Steck hopes that the conclusions of his seminar, the focus groups and the survey can be discussed within the next two years and tested and reformed within the next three to four.
 
 
 
“Whatever happens is going to be incremental,” he said. “There will not be any revolutionary thing in the next few years where we come up with a new program, set of requirements, that everyone needs to go through. What we’ll see is a set of creative alternatives, and we’ll see whether those work.”
 
 
 
But Steck’s drive for change lies not in revolutionizing the curriculum, but in his passion to determine what is best for Georgetown’s undergraduate students and the university on the whole.
 
 
 
“One time a colleague of mine asked me, `What’s wrong with the present curriculum?’ and my response was `To know what’s wrong with the present curriculum, we would have to know what the right version is,'” he said. “We can’t really know what’s wrong with it until we know what it should be doing.”

THE HOYA sat down to talk to Gus Bainimoli, the newest member of Outdoor Education. Born and raised in Fiji, he worked as an outdoor guide, leading visitors around the islands’ natural wonders. As the assistant director of Outdoor Education at Georgetown, Bainimoli oversees the planning of trips and leads a few of his own. In the waning days of his first semester on campus, Bainimoli made time to tell THE HOYA about his life back in Fiji and his experiences at Georgetown so far.
*What was your life like in Fiji?*
I used to work in hotels, guiding. As a qualified dive master, I used to work as a dive guide. I used to take guests surfing and all those outdoor activities. I would teach windsurfing and surfing. And I have my own place now. I have my own garden and stuff: When I’m off work, I work on the garden. I do spear fishing and a lot of outdoor activities.
*What was your first contact with Georgetown? What brought you here?*
The Outdoor Education Director Russ Watts usually brings groups to Fiji. He brings all these student groups to Fiji. So I met with him in Fiji, and he organized all this for me. When they came to Fiji, I took them backpacking, camping, hiking … and snorkeling. Those who wanted to go scuba diving, I took scuba diving. I took them to my village.
[Georgetown students] came to Fiji twice, in 2007 and 2008, with Russ Watts and the outdoor program. They came over in 2007; that’s when I met Russ. Then we organized this [job] for me. He wanted me to come over [to Georgetown] and know more about the outdoor stuff, computer skills, business and help with the outdoor program here.
*What is your role in the Outdoor Education program?*
The students, they run trips. They manage outdoor stuff like rock climbing. I am just the assistant Outdoor director, and we just kind of look after what they are doing.
*Will you have the opportunity to lead any trips?*
This is my second month here, so I will organize trips also. Because I am a qualified scuba diving master, I am thinking about organizing a trip to Florida.
*Are there any trips happening soon?*
At the moment we are not running any trips because winter is coming … and Christmas. We will start doing trips again in January.
*Where do the trips go?*
We will organize trips to Nicaragua, and we will try to organize trips to Fiji. Maybe scuba diving trips to Florida and maybe a sailing trip to the Virgin Islands.
*Have you made any changes to the program since you arrived?*
I just came into the system as it was, and we are trying to sort out some stuff just to change it a little bit. Not now but I think in January we are going to be coming out with some other plans for changing stuff for the outdoor program. Maybe some other new trips will be coming up.
*Do you have any advice for students who might want to get involved but do not have any experience?*
I think [the trips] are for everyone, all the students at Georgetown. I think the outdoor program is really cool for everyone. You don’t need any experience; you just come in and you get all sorts of stuff you should know about backpacking and kayaking and just enjoy the outdoor experience. We have all the gear.
*What are your plans going forward?*
I will still go back to Fiji. My visa is just until the end of June. I am trying to organize a trip with Georgetown; I will go back with them. They want to go on a trip to Fiji. If I get the opportunity to come back and work [here] – sure, I would want to come back.
