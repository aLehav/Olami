Members of the Georgetown University Student Association Senate condemned a mass gathering of students on campus celebrating the men’s basketball team’s March 13 Big East Championship win. 
During the March 14 Senate meeting, senators questioned why Georgetown University Police Department officers did not disperse the crowd. Photos and videos posted on social media of the incident showed a large crowd of students, many of whom were not wearing masks or social distancing on and off campus property, congregating outside the gates on 37th Street NW and O Street NW next to the Village B dormitories, where some students are currently living this semester. 
GUSA Senator Leo Rassieur (COL ’23) said he plans to ask GUPD why it allegedly chose to move students off campus property rather than write students up for student conduct violations. 
“Why it is that the GUPD response was essentially to push students out of the main gates but then to not monitor them when there’s been so many other times when they will write you up for just walking around — even off-campus — when maybe you’re intoxicated or something or your house has an off-campus noise complaint,” Rassieur said at the GUSA meeting.
Senators cited harsher enforcement of COVID-19 regulations by university patrol forces this past year as instances when the university has used more punitive measures, including incidents involving the Student Neighborhood Assistance Program, a neighborhood patrol service under Georgetown’s Office of Neighborhood Life that responds to complaints from Georgetown community residents. In the past year, SNAP has punished students for non-COVID-19-related violations such as noise complaints even when they were off campus.
In the aftermath of the incident, many students took to GroupMe and social media to express their concerns over the health hazards the on-campus gathering could potentially cause. Students also pushed for GUSA to take action in response to the incident, according to GUSA Senator Dominic Gordon (SFS ’24). 
“I don’t really know how GUSA should move forward with this,” Gordon said at the meeting. “But it was concerning to me and it was concerning to a lot of other people on campus, a lot of people that weren’t on campus, and I’d like to figure out what we can do about this going forward.”
Georgetown University encourages all students to continue to follow university COVID-19 guidelines to protect others and for the possibility of a return to campus, according to a university spokesperson. 
“We urge students to follow all University health and safety measures in order to protect themselves and others,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We will only be successful in returning everyone to campus if we all work together to reduce the spread of the virus by wearing a mask, keeping at least six feet apart, and keeping indoor and outdoor gatherings to 10 people or fewer.” 
The university has received reports regarding the incident and is addressing them, according to a March 18 email from Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson, reminding students that noncompliance with university COVID-19 guidelines is a violation of the Code of Student Conduct, 
“While we appreciate the celebratory moment, it is crucial that we all adhere to public health guidance to stop the spread of the virus and to protect all members of our community,” Olson wrote in the email. 
Senators echoed these concerns at the meeting, including GUSA Senate Speaker Melanie Cruz-Morales (COL ’22), who said the university must publicly respond to the on-campus gathering.
“Just seeing countless and countless people without masks is enough to demand an answer from the university and GUPD,” Cruz-Morales said.  
Many students have called for the abolition of GUPD after complaints of hyperpolicing, particularly from students of color, who have reported experiences of unnecessary and excessive force from GUPD. GUPD’s response to the incident was racially biased, according to GUSA Senator Makayla Jeffries (COL ’23), the organizer of the GUPD Abolition Working Group, which aims to abolish university police and instead establish alternative community solutions.
“When I went outside, I just saw GUPD just watching it happen because the crowd was white,” Jeffries said at the meeting. 
University officials do not monitor student group discussions or take positions on topics discussed, so the university declined to respond to the GUSA Senators’ comments that GUPD’s actions were racially motivated, according to a university spokesperson.

Wait, so do you believe in abolishing the police or having them ramp up their enforcement? Were you rooting for them to break up this particular gathering as a one-time-only sort of thing? I’m very confused.

In any other year, Katrina Hatahet (LAW ’21) would be conducting fieldwork for her International Women’s Human Rights Clinic in Lesotho, but travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic have posed challenges to the clinic’s work to advance women’s rights as teams shift to remote interviews.
This spring, the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic, a 10-credit course at the Georgetown University Law Center, has two teams with four students each that are working on women’s inheritance laws in Lesotho, which determine what an individual will receive from an estate. Within the country’s dual legal system, many rural women’s issues fall under the domain of customary law rather than the domain of general civil law. Customary law is based in local customs and often restricts female autonomy, denies widows the right to inherit from their husbands and grants inheritance to the eldest male son.
One group, the constitutional project team, is partnering with local women’s organizations in Lesotho to draft a human rights report, aiming to influence the country’s current constitutional rewriting process, according to Hatahet. The second group, the inheritance project team, is researching domestic and international laws, constitutional arguments and comparative country examples to advocate for women’s inheritance rights through new legislation. 
It has been more challenging this year to reach individuals who are willing to participate, according to Hatahet, who is working on the IWHRC constitutional team.
“There are also risks involved for those who might not even have access to the technology,”  Hatahet said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Individuals who might not have access to the technology that would be necessary to conduct these interviews would then maybe have to otherwise seek transportation to those NGOs who may have access to the technology.” 
Despite obstacles due to this year’s virtual interviews, the IWHRC is pushing the government of Lesotho to comply with its international agreements, according to Grace Edwards (LAW ’22), who is working on the IWHRC inheritance team.
“It’s just a little bit tougher scheduling-wise because we have to make sure that everyone has internet access on both sides and can do an interview over Zoom and WhatsApp, which is always just a bit more awkward and impersonal than doing it in person, because it’s a little bit harder to build that relationship,” Edwards said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
Although students have not traveled to Lesotho, the IWHRC has been able to conduct interviews that are similar in structure and scope to previous years. The teams have spoken with various stakeholders, including government officials, nongovernmental organizations and judges regarding their views under the current laws and their proposed solutions, according to Edwards. 
Since its founding in 1998, the IWHRC has worked with advocacy partners in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, South America and central Europe to combat legal discrimination against women. Professor Susan Deller Ross, the founder and current director of the IWHRC, developed the idea alongside several graduate students from African countries, who brought to her attention instances of unjust legislation against women. 
The IWHRC was subsequently created to work with advocacy partners abroad, according to Ross.
“They were the ones who told me about the laws in the books from the countries they were from,” Ross said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Laws that allowed men to practice polygamy by marrying as many women as they wanted. Laws that allowed men to beat their wives up, laws that said only men could inherit. There were just many laws on the books that let men treat women very badly.”
The inheritance laws that the clinic is investigating this year highlight how women living in rural and urban areas experience unequal property rights, according to Ross.
“One of the rules that governs rural women is that the oldest son inherits when a man dies,” Ross said. “His widow doesn’t get anything, the other siblings don’t get anything, the mom is often kicked out by the son. Or maybe it’s the son by a different wife, because he’s polygamous and it’s the oldest son that gets the inheritance.”
The interviews, despite challenges encountered by their virtual formats this year, will be an essential part of developing the clinic’s final human rights report, according to Hatahet.
“I wasn’t sure what to expect with everything, having virtual interviews and operating in a different time zone, and trying to connect to the other part of the world,” Hatahet said. “It’s definitely better than I had expected, and we gathered a lot of great insights so far from all these different interviews. These interviews are very valuable to our human rights report, and they definitely serve to better inform our proposals that we’ll be making.”

Georgetown University international first-year and transfer students are reporting logistical, academic and financial barriers to attending the university’s recently introduced five-week summer immersion program. 
The university created the Summer Hilltop Immersion Program as a chance for first-year and transfer students to engage in in-person learning and to interact with faculty and peers after a full year of virtual learning because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, international students who hope to attend the program are concerned with F-1 visa applicability, heavier workloads, shortened summer vacation and a lack of information about tuition and financial aid.
While domestic students enrolled in SHIP are only required to take six to eight credit hours during the program, international students will face a different set of criteria. Students eligible to live and study in the United States under an F-1 visa must be enrolled in 12 credit hours their first semester on campus to qualify as a full-time student. 
To meet this requirement, international students who have not previously lived on campus would have to take a significantly heavier course load over the summer than domestic students, according to Renato Llontop Calosi (SFS ’24), a student from Peru who has lived at home for the entirety of this school year.
“It is a burden to take 12 credits in the summer and going directly to taking 12 credits in the fall as well,” Calosi said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “I will say the benefit will be to be in person with people — to be on campus and have that experience.”
To meet the 12-credit requirement, the university is offering international students a second five-week block of six credits in addition to the immersion program, according to a university spokesperson.
“This is not a Georgetown policy but is an immigration requirement,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Despite the reported difficulties, the university is looking forward to welcoming first-year and transfer students back to campus this summer, according to the spokesperson. 
“We understand that each student will need to make their own decision on if this is the right option for them but we welcome international students to take part in SHIP, and hope that many of them are able to join us,” the spokesperson wrote.
In addition to visa and credit concerns, there has been a lack of communication from the university about financial aid and any additional costs international students may incur, according to Calosi. 
“Information from the university to international students has not been transparent,” Calosi said. “Until now, we haven’t received any information from the university about the extra costs, or if it will be the same cost of SHIP.”
The university is providing full need-based financial aid to qualifying students, according to the university spokesperson.
The total cost of attending the five weeks of SHIP is $7,500. However, the university has not provided additional information regarding the cost of extra credits necessary for international students. Without adequate information about the final cost, many international students are feeling pressured to make a final decision without being fully informed, according to Calosi.
SHIP is set to begin June 4, just over two weeks after the spring semester ends. For many international students, there would be no time to go home between the end of the spring semester and the beginning of SHIP, giving students no choice but to stay in the United States without university-provided housing, according to Andrea Ho (SFS ’24), a student from Singapore currently living on campus. 
“Domestic students can just return to their home states, but for international students, the school hasn’t really made any comment on where we can put up for those two weeks,” Ho said in an interview with The Hoya. “For a lot of us, it doesn’t make sense to leave the U.S. for such a short period of time.”
The university did not comment on students’ concerns about housing in between the school year and the start of the program.
While many international students are concerned with obstacles preventing them from participating in SHIP, they also worry opting out of the program would result in missing out on its many benefits, according to Maria Posada (COL ’24), a first-year student from London currently living on campus.
“If they had formulated the program in a way that we could attend, where all the freshmen could be on campus together at the same time and meet each other, then internationals wouldn’t be so specifically excluded,” Posada said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We are concerned about social aspects because all the Americans can come and meet each other in person with only freshmen on campus, but the internationals cannot, so it is going to be way harder for us to integrate next semester.”

Georgetown University recently hired a new director in its health education services office, following an almost eight-month vacancy and calls from students to increase diversity within the office. 
The university hired Val Tovar as the new associate director of sexual assault response and prevention for diversity and inclusion in February, according to a March 5 email to the university community. Tovar previously served as a sexual assault prevention coordinator at American University.
Students with marginalized identities experience specific barriers to success on campus, according to Tovar, who plans to bring new strategies to Georgetown in order to become a resource for all students.
“I have professional experience, and I am a woman of color who has maneuvered in these spaces for many years, however I know students are the experts when it comes to knowing their needs,” Tovar wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I want to be a vessel to listen and advocate for the resources and support in order to help create a community of care for all students.” 
Tovar, who has also worked at the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, a nonprofit anti-sexual assault organization, and The Trevor Project, an organization focused on LGBTQ suicide prevention, has the experience necessary to meet the needs of the university’s HES, including supporting diverse groups of students, according to Title IX Coordinator and Director of Title IX Compliance Samantha Berner. 
“Val comes to the institution with experience and a dedicated focus on diversity and inclusion, which further advances the efforts of the University to better meet the needs of all members of our community, including BIPOC and LGBTQ+ students,” Berner wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Last June, former Assistant Director of Sexual Assault Response and Prevention Jennifer Wiggins resigned from the position, prompting student advocacy for increased support from a more diverse student health staff. Wiggins was known for her significant work within the office, including supporting the Black survivor community despite limited resources.
To support diversity and inclusion, the most important part of the director’s job is supporting marginalized students and helping students who might feel they are not seen by the university, according to Tovar.
“My hope is to continue and grow the incredible work so many have done, keep advocating and creating systemic changes, and to celebrate when we make strides,” Tovar wrote.
The university needs to take more steps than just Tovar’s appointment to make up for Wiggins’ departure, including hiring additional staff to alleviate the director’s workload, according to Katarina Watson (COL ’21), co-organizing director of H*yas for Choice, a pro-abortion rights student group.
“I would argue that many more people than Val Tovar should be replacing her position because Jen did so much and essentially held up the Black survivor community,” Watson said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya.
In February 2020, the Black Survivors Coalition, a student group advocating for Black women and nonbinary survivors on campus, launched the #GeorgetownDoesntCare campaign to protest the university’s failure to support survivors of sexual assault. In response to a series of sit-ins outside the office of University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95), the university contracted with 14 BIPOC temporary health counselors, but students have continued to push for permanent appointments. 
The university also changed its Title IX policies according to changes by the Department of Education in May 2020, which included greater protections for students accused of sexual assault. Since the inauguration, however, the Biden administration has already begun to reverse some of the Trump administration’s guidelines. 
Despite the revised policies implemented due to the Trump administration’s changes, the university is still working to hold perpetrators accountable, raise awareness and encourage reporting of sexual assault, according to Berner. 
“Where the new regulations allow the University to exercise discretion in adopting policy and procedural changes, we plan to seek longer term, broad input from the community,” Berner wrote. “We will continue to focus on education and prevention, support for individuals impacted, and prompt and equitable processes to respond to reports and complaints of sexual misconduct.” 
After the proposed changes to Title IX legislation were released in November 2018, the university sought community input through town halls and feedback sessions in which many students voiced their concerns about the new regulations. Student concerns included a tighter definition of sexual assault that would make it difficult for survivors to provide proof of assault and the proposed allowance for cross-examination of the survivor by the accused student’s adviser. Following student input, the university submitted a formal comment to the Department of Education expressing disapproval of the relaxed policies. When the policies went into effect over the summer, administrators facilitated community feedback and promised to make minimal changes to policy, aware of community displeasure. 
Because of the many recent changes in Title IX policy and developments in student advocacy over the past year, Tovar will have to work to support students in a new environment, Watson said. 
“Everything’s different, so Val will just have to reach as many students as possible, be a support system and think of more peer programming,” Watson said. “Val obviously still has the capacity to support the Black community, but it is going to look a little different. So just connecting to students, being there for them and listening to what they need during this time.”
However, with her past experience and dedication to supporting Georgetown’s marginalized communities, Tovar will be successful as long as she works to advocate for all students, according to Watson.
“She shouldn’t feel as if she’s in Jen’s shadow in any way, because that’s more detrimental than anything else,” Watson said. “I think if she genuinely cares about these issues and about students, the rest will follow along naturally.”
