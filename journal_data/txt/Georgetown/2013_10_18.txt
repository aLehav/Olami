Although Congress ended the federal government shutdown Wednesday evening, damage from lost revenue may be irreversible for the District of Columbia — a reality that influenced Congress’ decision to grant D.C. temporary budget autonomy.
According to Mayor Vincent Gray’s Senior Communications Manager Doxie McCoy, the economy of Washington, D.C., whose budget is funded by local taxpayer funds but controlled by the federal government, was substantially affected. The D.C. metropolitan area, which includes D.C., Maryland and Virginia, lost $217 million, or 17.6 percent of the region’s economy, each day of the 16-day shutdown from lost or deferred federal and contractor wages. The District also lost $6 million each week in tax revenue. Hotel revenue was down by $2 million from October 2012.
Because Wednesday evening’s deal only extended the debt ceiling to Feb. 7 and temporarily funded the federal government until Jan. 15, congressional leaders struck a deal with Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) that granted the District government temporary budget autonomy until Sept. 30, 2014. This signifies unprecedented autonomy for D.C., allowing it to stay open and fund local services even if the federal government shuts down again in January.
“A boomerang solution putting D.C. back in the federal government’s fiscal mess in January was beyond unacceptable,” Norton said in a statement. “This authority to spend our local funds for the full fiscal year, although the federal government is open only through Jan. 15, 2014, is a historic first.”
Government professor Mark Rom emphasized the importance of this increase in autonomy, a step that District leaders have been seeking for the last few years.
“Traditionally, the Congress has held the District’s reins tight, even regarding how D.C. could spend its own money,” Rom said. “Gaining the authority to fund programs with the District’s own money, as it sees fit, is a pretty big step toward ‘taxation with representation.’”
During the shutdown, Gray was able to continue funding District operations by declaring all employees as “essential” and tapping into the District’s $144 million contingency fund in an unprecedented move. This allowed general services, such as garbage collection and the Metro, to continue running, but Gray reported that the fund was only enough to last through the end of October.
“This is uncharted territory for us,” Gray said during the press conference. “We don’t want the story to become that we did something that was inappropriate.”
Georgetown University College Democrats President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) criticized Republican tactics, which he blamed for the shutdown.
“All the Republicans have accomplished has been to shut down the government and rattle the financial markets in order to score political points with their constituents,” Tezel said. “It’s relieving that a deal has been struck, but we cannot continue to govern from crisis to crisis. Hopefully, this signals to the Republican Party that they cannot let the fringe elements in their caucus dictate policy in the future.”
Georgetown University College Republicans Communications Manager Tim Rosenberger (COL ’16), however, praised Republican leaders for compromising by sacrificing their ultimate goals.
“We are so proud to have leaders like Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell in our party,” Rosenberger said. “It takes the kind of selfless leadership they embodied in this latest round of negotiations to govern effectively. Republicans got very little in this deal, and thus, understandably, many were opposed. That being said, many put returning the government to functioning ahead of other concerns and reached an effective compromise.”
Overall, Tezel and Rosenberger agreed that increased budget autonomy for D.C. is an important step in the right direction.
“A year of budget autonomy will be very healthy for the District, and we applaud Norton for her hard work on behalf of her constituents,” Rosenberger said.
Tezel added that he hoped this would set a new precedent for District rights.
“In terms of budget autonomy, this not only makes practical sense under a federal government that is being funded through a continuing resolution, it makes sense to give this right to D.C. residents as well,” Tezel said. “Congress should have no role in determining the budget for a city whose constituents they are not electorally responsible to. Hopefully, this is the first step in the long road to greater District autonomy.”
Norton agreed.
“Residents must see more than a reprieve from this year’s serial federal shutdown brinks,” Norton said in a statement. “We must now make use of the damage done by moving on all fronts for full budget autonomy.”

Mark Waugh (LAW ’16), 23, was stabbed to death during the early hours of Sunday morning in a long-time friend’s apartment in Silver Spring, Md.
The friend, Rahul Gupta (GRD ’13), a biomedical engineering graduate student at The George Washington University, is charged with second-degree murder for allegedly stabbing Waugh with a kitchen knife after a party celebrating Gupta’s 24th birthday.
Gupta is being held on $2 million bail in the Montgomery County jail. He has pleaded not guilty.
According to testimony from Gupta’s girlfriend, Waugh, Gupta and Gupta’s girlfriend returned to Gupta’s Silver Spring high-rise apartment and continued drinking after going out, when Gupta said he found his girlfriend with Waugh.
“My girl was cheating with my buddy,” Gupta said in the charging papers. “I walked in on them cheating, and I killed my buddy.”
The Montgomery County Police Department reported that at approximately 3:25 a.m. on Oct. 13, local police responded to a 911 call to Gupta’s apartment for “unknown trouble,” where they found Gupta covered in blood. Waugh was unresponsive with seven or eight stab wounds and other superficial wounds.
“This was a vicious attack,” Assistant State Attorney Stephen Chaikin said Tuesday during Gupta’s first day in court.
According to Chaikin, Waugh sustained wounds to his jugular vein, upper chest and back, in addition to a punctured lung. Waugh also had injuries that indicated attempts of self-defense.
“The victim, and it’s obvious by the forensic evidence, defended himself from a savage knife attack,” Chaikin said.
The Georgetown Law community has reacted to Waugh’s death by offering counseling and chaplain services on campus.
“[Waugh] was a bright young man, full of potential,” the Georgetown Law Center said in a media statement. “The Georgetown Law community is shocked and deeply saddened by this tragic loss.”
Several aspects of the night, however, are still unclear.
According to WJLA, Reginald Bours III, Gupta’s lawyer, questioned the accuracy of the police report that claimed that Gupta said, “I walked in on them cheating, and I killed my buddy.”
Bours said that he had no knowledge of any cheating and added that the statement did not make sense because all three people were in the studio apartment at the same time.
“That did not happen. I have no idea how they got that or how they attribute him to saying that,” Bours told WJLA. “There’s got to be confusion on somebody’s part.”
Gupta’s girlfriend, who has thus far been unnamed, told police that she did not remember anything in the apartment after taking multiple shots of alcohol. According to the police, Gupta also made conflicting reports at the time of his arrest, asserting at one time that Waugh tried to kill him. Gupta was uninjured.
“We’re still trying to piece together what happened in that apartment,” Montgomery County Police Captain Jim Daly told Gazette.net.
Georgetown Police Chief Jay Gruber called the killing tragic.
“I know alcohol was involved,” Gruber said. “It’s very hard to give advice to avoid a situation like that. It was a crime of passion and a very sad event.”
Waugh and Gupta were childhood friends who attended Langley High School in McLean, Va., together. Prior to attending Georgetown University Law Center, Waugh graduated magna cum laude from James Madison University in 2012 and spent a year teaching debate in South Korea. At Georgetown, Waugh had just been inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honors society.
“Everyone was Mark’s friend,” Michael Davis, a friend and professor to Mark at JMU, wrote in an email. “Mark set the bar for what it means to be completely and totally committed to each other. He set a standard that was impossible to live up to.”
Tuesday’s hearing, held in the Montgomery County District Court, focused on Gupta’s $2 million jail bond, which Bours had asked to be lowered to $50,000.
“I believe the evidence will ultimately show that he has a valid defense,” Bours said in court. “It’s particularly tragic for someone who has a defense and who has a promising career and a proven track record at school to be held on a bond of this amount.”
Judge William Simmons, however, declined the request, and Chaikin disagreed that Gupta’s record should have any relevance to his bail requirement.
“All these facts, and this wonderful resume and background, were a different time period in this defendant’s life,” Chaikin said in court. “He’s on a different path now.”

Georgetown’s next Jack the Bulldog will arrive on campus early next week, bringing with him some changes to the university’s system of mascot care.
The Jack Crew, the group that assists Fr. ChristopherSteck, S.J., with the mascot, will be cut from 20 to four or five members.
“We’ve agreed to cut down the Jack Crew because it is unhealthy for the dog to have so many masters, especially when he is just getting used to his new surroundings,” said Paul O’Neill (COL ’86), Georgetown’s chief operating officer for advancement and a member of the Bulldog Advisory Committee.
Though the current Jack Crew members care for Jack, the 10-year-old dog does not need to be walked as often as he once did, according to Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14), a member of the Jack Crew and the BAC. After the new dog, whose full name is John Carroll, has adjusted to campus, the Jack Crew could be expanded again.
“We really need to provide the dog with intimate relationships,” Ramadan said. “Rather than cut, I think we are going to find people who are available and can deal with the puppy as much as possible just so he is familiar and comfortable.”
Bulldog breeder Janice Hochstetler determined that the new bulldog, who will likely go by Jack as well, was ready to be introduced to college life and to settle into life in a Georgetown townhouse on 36thStreet. Hochstetler will spend several days on campus, seeing how the new bulldog acclimates to crowds and students taking pictures with him.
Applications for mascot caretaker opened today, and will be accepted through next Friday. Steck, who cared for former mascot-in-training Jack Jr. along with Jack in New South, declined to take care of the new dog after the university denied his request for assistance from a student if he were to take on the responsibility.
According to the position summary, Georgetown “seeks a passionate and dedicated person to serve as caretaker for the university’s live bulldog mascot. The ideal candidate for this position is someone who loves dogs, is passionate about Georgetown University and will facilitate visibility of the bulldog mascot on campus.”
The responsibilities of the caretaker will include providing daily care for the dog, managing the dog’s schedule of public appearances and training the downsized Jack Crew to assist the bulldog.
The Bulldog Advisory Committee, a 14-member body composed of faculty, students, alumni and staff, will vet the caretaker applicants. The caretaker is expected to make a long-term commitment to the new mascot, ideally five years or more.
“There are many people in our community that are passionate about Georgetown’s bulldog tradition, so I’m sure that we’ll have a long list of good applicants for the caretaker position,” O’Neill said.
The new bulldog shares the same mother, Treasure, as J.J., though they come from different litters. The mascot will be at the men’s home soccer game against DePaul University on Wednesday in order to gauge how comfortable he is in front of large crowds. Hochstetler will also walk the bulldog around Copley Lawn and O’Donovan Hall during highly trafficked times to see how he interacts with students.
Ramadan said that he was happy that the mascot tradition will continue.
“I’m very excited. I hope Georgetown is excited. It is a tradition and I think students made their voices very clear on what they wanted to see continue,” he said. “It’s nice to finally have that end goal in sight. And that end goal just so happens to be a really cute bulldog.”

GU Pride’s OUTober is taking on the intersection of sexuality and socioeconomic factors in its month-long celebration of LGBTQ identity.
GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) said that this year’s focus on socioeconomics is intended to broaden OUTober’s appeal to a larger community.
“On a basic level, we engage everyone at Georgetown, but the reason why [OUTober is] important for Georgetown as an institution is by raising awareness about the LGBTQ community, you fight back against things that weren’t as public five years ago, like violence against gay students,” he said.
At an event last Wednesday, “Beyond Gay Marriage: Race, Class and the Future of the LGBTQ Movement,” six panelists discussed how other factors, like immigrant status, class and race, affect the LGBTQ community.
One of the panelists, Kimberley McLeod (COL ’09), urged students to embrace multiple sides of their identities. McLeod is the founder and editor-in-chief of Elixher, an online magazine catering to the black female queer community.
By accepting her identity as a black lesbian, McLeod said she is able to embrace her individuality.
“I exist as a totality of who I am,” McLeod said.
The panelists also said that the gay movement should support causes beyond gay marriage. Panelist Urooj Arshad, who advocates for the LGBTQ community in the Caribbean, Africa and Asia, talked about how homosexuals face violence and discrimination.
Sticking with traditional OUTober events, students walked through a door in Red Square on Coming Out Day last Friday, allowing them to “come out” as LGBTQ or an ally.
PBS, which produces a Religion and Ethics newsweekly, filmed the event for an episode exploring the identities of Catholic colleges. According to Lloyd, PBS wanted to investigate the balance Georgetown achieved as a Catholic institution that has such an active and vibrant LGBTQ community.
Celeste Chisholm (COL ’15), the trans* representative for GU Pride, appreciated the distinctive balance.
“We are a Catholic school, and the fact that we can do something like this, I think, is indicative of a lot of understanding between two traditionally polarized groups,” Chisholm said. “I think doing that allows a conversation to be started and it also sets a precedent for other schools like ours.”
Pride started planning the month-long program last April and had speakers lined up over the summer with some support and funding from the LGBTQ Center.
Lloyd said that during OUTober, Pride had to be aware of other events occurring simultaneously that affected the LGBTQ community. He specifically cited Love Saxa events this month that brought speakers whom Lloyd described as homophobic.
“During OUTober, we have to have a heightened sensitivity towards events that happen during the same time,” Lloyd said. “Because it took place during OUTober, Pride had to have a presence. You can’t let that sort of speaker go when it’s our month.”
Lloyd expressed his hope that students will glean a sense of understanding from OUTober.
“By having some of the events about different identities, I hope students get a fuller understanding about themselves,” Lloyd said. “I think that our focus for OUTober is very Jesuit in that we’re forcing people to engage all aspects of their identity and focus on unpacking the intersections of those identities.”

Georgetown University Medical Center administrators presented updates to faculty members about progress at the medical school and the effects of the government shutdown as well as the 2010 Campus Plan agreement at the school’s biannual town hall Tuesday.
Howard Federoff, School of Medicine executive dean and executive vice president for health sciences, presided over the meeting.
GUMC Dean of Research Robert Clarke discussed the effects of the shutdown, including funding delays and postponed events. In addition, Clarke applauded the faculty members for their continued success in acquiring funding grants. According to Clarke, Georgetown continues to be competitive with peer institutions such as Brown University, Tufts University and Johns Hopkins University. Specifically, Georgetown recently won a competitive grant for stroke research.
“What was really nice was to beat the crap out of [Johns] Hopkins,” he said.
Several other administrators also gave updates about various sectors of the Medical Center and the School of Nursing and Health Studies.
According to NHS Dean Martin Iguchi, the NHS recently updated its website and saw a 70 percent donation rate from the Class of 2013. In addition, Iguchi spoke about the success of the new multidisciplinary Master of Science in Global Health, which launched this fall. The program involves courses taught by faculty from the College, the NHS, the School of Foreign Service, GUMC, the Georgetown University Law Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy.
After the presentations, Federoff held a question-and-answer period. One audience member asked Federoff how GUMC planned to expand and invest in its infrastructure over the coming years.
“All of what we can know now suggests there’s going to be downward pressure on tuition growth,” Federoff said.
According to Federoff, any financial gains would most likely go toward offsetting this decrease in revenue, rather than investing in further infrastructure.
Other audience members wondered how the movement of a majority of the undergraduates onto campus, a provision of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, would affect the medical school campus.
“[University President John J. DeGioia] is under a lot of pressure to bring the undergraduates back onto campus,” Federoff said. “The locations of those new dorms, I think, are not likely to have any impact.”

Nine campus organizations ranging from Alpha Phi Omega to Students of Georgetown, Inc. will sponsor the 2013 Georgetown Walk for the Homeless this Sunday in Red Square.
All of the walk’s proceeds will benefit the Georgetown Ministry Center, which uses street outreach and community education to help guide homeless individuals to stable living situations.
“The Help the Homeless walk is one of our biggest fundraisers, and it is vital for us because we receive little government funding,” GMC Outreach Director Roy Witherspoon said. “We rely mostly on corporate sponsors, individual donations and events like this to keep our doors open seven days a week, 365 days a year.”
GMC operates centers serving the homeless in Georgetown and Foggy Bottom, where guests can shower, do laundry, talk to a case manager, see a general practitioner and psychiatrist, use the computer, obtain new clothes and participate in educational programming.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s Help the Homeless program, which has raised over $100 million for homeless men, women and children since 1988, is bringing the walk to campus. The nonprofit group’s goal is to provide shelter for the nearly 12,000 homeless in the Washington, D.C. area by raising funds for local organizations and spreading awareness. The Center for Social Justice, Research, Teaching and Service and Georgetown Business Improvement District have also helped organize the event.
Participants, whose $20 registration directly benefits GMC, will choose between a two kilometer walk or a five kilometer run through the Georgetown campus and surrounding neighborhood. The event will kick off in Red Square at 11 a.m. with registration, a blessing and a keynote speech. After the run and walk, there will be a celebratory barbecue and prizes for the fastest male and female runners.
Hoyas Outreach Programs and Education President Philip Sidoti (MSB ’14) said that the support from Georgetown community groups helps increase the event’s impact for the local homeless community.
“H.O.P.E. has been involved in the Help the Homeless Walk for several years now, and we are proud to now have the walk taking place on campus for a second consecutive year. The help that we have received from student groups has been incredible,” he said. “Our work with GMC representatives has gone very well. We are looking forward to seeing a lot of Georgetown students participate on Sunday.”
Among the student groups directly helping with the walk are the Georgetown University Grilling Society, which will be doing the barbecue, and WGTB, which will be MCing the event.
Students have expressed excitement about participating in the event.
“The Graduate Student Organization sent out an email with information about the walk/run, and it seemed like a small way to do something positive in support of helping others,” runner Julianna Carney (GRD ’16) said.

When Marshall Bailly founded Leadership Initiatives as an undergraduate at American University, he never imagined he would still be managing the nonprofit nine years later.
But nearly a decade after its founding in 2004, Leadership Initiatives is still successfully funding entrepreneurial ventures in Nigeria.
Rather than donating money, food or medicine to struggling communities, the nonprofit partners with communities by financing small businesses. Loan recipients pay back local investors at a modest 12.5 percent interest rate.
“Leadership Initiatives works with the community to build up the community,” Bailly said of the nonprofit, which has started more than 40 businesses in Nigeria. “We changed the way people live their lives.”
Leadership Initiatives has been able to provide an alternative lifestyle for young men and women who might otherwise join Boko Haram, a terrorist group that is widely influential in Nigeria.
Emmy Buck (COL ’16) interned at Leadership Initiatives for a year through her “Law and Society” class taught by professor Sarah Stiles, who Bailly has formed a relationship with to promote Leadership Initiatives and find potential interns.
In the past four years Bailly has partnered with Stiles “Law and Society” class and has drawn a majority of his interns from speaking to her class.
“There is a lot of fighting, and we can never completely know what is going to happen next,” Buck said.
Despite these challenges, Leadership Initiatives has largely been able to convince Nigerian locals that their program is a better option than joining a terrorist organization.
Soon after joining Leadership Initiatives, Buck became the assistant director of the organization’s International Business Alliance program, a competitive program for high school students that allows them to assist Leadership Initiatives’ projects in Nigeria. The program stresses cross-cultural collaboration so that students can help implement a broad variety of projects.
“Leadership Initiatives has a hold in so many areas, not only helping Nigerians but high school and college students as well,” Buck said. “They learn what it means to become a leader, to be innovative, to communicate their ideas and take charge, allowing them to have a better understanding of Nigeria,” Buck said.
The nonprofit has partnered with a variety of organizations, including Microsoft and the U.S. government. After Leadership Initiatives hones operations in Nigeria, it hopes to expand its college internship program and continue to grow the International Business Alliance program.
“The craziest part is that we’re taking Georgetown students and they improve these programs every year,” Bailly said. “They make a huge difference.”
Leadership Initiatives intern Kelsey Jones (COL ’15) said that the nonprofit has made a notable impact in a variety of areas in the United States and Nigeria.
“The impact that LI has is mind-blowing,” Jones said. “LI has improved the health, economy and overall living experience for the Nigerian people involved.”
“What Professor Holtom has taught me is that in order to affect the world outside, you have to understand the world within. And so he would make us do things like ‘what do we value,’ ‘what makes us tick,’” O’Driscoll said. “Themes start to emerge throughout your life, and when you see those themes, you identify who you are, and when you identify who you are, you can stand for something, and when you stand for something that is when you have the first seeds of leadership.”
Holtom’s focus on passion has led the students to choose projects that are individually meaningful.
Jack Schumacher (MSB ’15) and his partner Max Allen (MSB ’15) are working to raise money for organizations including the Wounded Warrior Amputee Softball Team and the Honor Flight Network, which invites World War II veterans for tours around Washington, D.C.
Schumacher spent six years in the military, and during his time in Afghanistan, he was severely wounded, leading to the loss of his leg.
“While I was recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, I saw how much of an impact small groups such as the Wounded Warrior Amputee Softball Team truly had on returning veterans,” Schumacher said.
Because Allen is also on the Georgetown baseball team, the Wounded Warrior Amputee Softball Team was a way for the two to express their passions simultaneously.
Previous projects have also made an impact, according to Holtom. One student started a project to help homeless people find jobs by providing resume-writing workshops and helping with interviewing techniques. By the end of the project, half of the participating group had gotten jobs for the Christmas season. Holtom said that this creativity in solving real world issues is effective leadership.
Holtom emphasizes introspection in the class because he believes the characteristics of a leader are very individual.
“I can’t tell you what a good leader looks like,” Holtom said. “You have to determine what you want to be as a leader and some people want to be a leader in their home, that’s great, some people want to be a leader in their community, some people want to lead the free world.”
Holtom further emphasized the role of passion and interest in leadership and entrepreneurship.
“Great entrepreneurs are born of passion. It’s not just a job, you have to have something you care about personally,” he said.
Holtom refuses to take credit for the successes of the projects and the students in the course. However, students said that Holtom’s guidance helps them develop their leadership skills.
“He definitely has a big role in the success of the class,” Matthew Hickey (MSB ’14) said. “Everyone that I’ve talked to just rants and raves about him.”
Hickey is working to establish a skin cancer awareness initiative at Georgetown for his project. The initiative kicked off its first skin cancer awareness week on Monday.
“I think just from a personal and human level, he really gives you inspiration and lets you find your own direction,” Schumacher said. “I want to be in the classroom, I want to hear what he has to say because he really does inspire me personally.”

Five years after the founding of ReImagine Georgetown, GUASFCU, The Corp and The Hoya have agreed to discontinue the program.
Created in 2007 as a way to fund student-run initiatives, RIG has encountered problems in following through on its grants.
Last year, organizers cut funds to inactive projects for the first time, as five initiatives had lapsed, and awarded only $5,000, half of its $10,000 budget. This year, student leaders decided the program, which began when the university approached the three largest student organizations, was not fit to continue.
Students of Georgetown Inc. CEO Lizzy MacGill (COL ’14) said that it was difficult to follow up on the successes and challenges of each initiative.
“Our predecessors in that transition told us that ReImagine Georgetown in the past had been successful in funding some great student projects,” MacGill said. “One of the limitations that they had communicated to us was that to follow through on the projects was really hard because it required the leaders from the biggest organizations on campus to be following up with the recipients of the award throughout their projects, and it’s just hard to do because your hands are full.”
Evan Hollander (SFS ’14), chair of The Hoya’s Board of Directors, said that ReImagine Georgetown did not meet the organizations’ standards.
“These are three organizations with great reputations,” he said. “If they’re putting their reputations on the line, it has to make a real, high-quality impact.”
Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union CEO Chris Kelly (COL ’14) pointed to logistical challenges the added responsibility of RIG created.
“I think the challenge is that you take some of the busiest people on campus, and you add on another responsibility,” he said. “It’s extremely worthwhile, but it was a little difficult to carry out.”
Past RIG success stories include the Georgetown University Farmers Market, established in spring 2011. The Corp and GUASFCU incorporated the project into their philanthropy initiatives, and The Hoya provided marketing and an advertisement avenue.
The representatives of each organization who comprised the RIG committee changed each year, which posed a challenge.
“When the people who are leading these initiatives graduate, you do lose some type of institutional memory,” Hollander said. “You have to make an extra effort for partnerships.”
RIG grants were disbursed with a one-time-only condition, meaning grant recipients could not reapply for funds. Winter Hoyaland received $2,000 last year to furnish Healy Circle with Christmas decorations, and many of the decorations will be reused this year.
“They were full disclosure going into it that it was a one-time grant and they directed me to other grants, like the GUSA grant … there was full disclosure that we couldn’t get more grants,” Winter Hoyaland founder Chris Yedibalian (COL ’13) said.
Short-term initiatives like Illuminate Lauinger, which received $1,000 to add artwork and other decoration to Lauinger Library, have found success through RIG, even if they have not yet followed through entirely.
The Corp and GUASFCU plan to reallocate their funds from RIG to other grants and scholarships.
GUASFCU introduced a test preparation grant this year that provides free tutoring for graduate school entry standardized tests and plans to add a summer school scholarship. The Corp is currently unsure of how it will reallocate its funds.
“We take our philanthropy pretty seriously,” MacGill said. “We give about $60,000 back to the community. We felt like we could do more by using that money to create a new scholarship, maybe even one that funds a particular aim that we’re trying to accomplish this year.”
Despite the discontinuation of RIG, Kelly stressed the importance of creativity and innovation on campus.
“There’s always a ton of room, especially at Georgetown, for funding for innovation. I think right now we’re kind of in a rebuilding phase,” Kelly said. “Whether or not we team up again with The Corp remains to be seen, but at this point we’re just trying to figure out what didn’t work and move from there.”

Eleven newly tenured faculty and six faculty members promoted to full professor were honored at the Fall Faculty Convocation in Gaston Hall Tuesday.
For some newly tenured faculty, reaching this threshold has been a long-standing goal.
“I’ve been seeking tenure since I was 20, in the sense that I’ve known that I’ve wanted to be an academic since I was 20,” psychology professor Abigail Marsh said.
For others, getting tenured was just an eventual part of the teaching process.
“There are people who see the end goal of getting tenure, but if you’re really committed to the job and really enjoy what you’re doing, it’s something that happens along the way,” professor Bryce Huebner, who received tenure in the philosophy department, said.
The long process of receiving tenure starts with getting put on the tenure track, compiling a portfolio of publications, teaching evaluations and service done to the university, presenting letters of support from prominent scholars in the same field and receiving department approval. Then, a candidate’s portfolio reaches the Rank and Tenure Committee, which chooses candidates to present to University President John J. DeGioia, who grants final approval.
Executive Vice President and Dean of the Georgetown University Law Center William Treanor presented the newly tenured faculty who completed this process, and DeGioia bestowed the President’s Award for Distinguished Scholar-Teachers to Der-Chen Chang, professor of mathematics and statistics, and pathology professor Richard Schlegel on Tuesday.
Along with job security, tenure provides other benefits for faculty.
“By having job security, you’re allowed to pursue lines of inquiry that you think are important and interesting without fear that you’ll be penalized if your research is politically unpopular,” said Marsh, who conducts behavioral research and neuroimaging using fMRIs that looks at different kinds of emotional processes in an attempt to understand the origins of aggression and altruism in humans. Huebner agrees with the importance of academic freedom and how it allows tenured faculty to question existing dogmas.
“I think that’s really important in academia, especially because the university should be designed to help people learn how to question things and call authority into question,” he said.
Full professors are given greater responsibilities within the department than tenured associate professors, like deciding the promotion of their colleagues, and in general, are awarded more acknowledgements.
Anna De Fina of the Italian department, a new full professor, anticipates the greater amount of freedom that comes along with the promotion.
“I’m looking forward to a level of freedom because I don’t have to demonstrate that I am able to do this or that. I have greater choice; I can do things slowly. If I write a book, I don’t have that deadline, like if it doesn’t come out by such and such date, I won’t get tenure or I won’t get a promotion,” De Fina said.
Yulia Chentsova-Dutton, a psychology professor, has noticed that her teaching has seen the indirect impact of her receiving tenure.
“With teaching, pre-tenure, there are so many things competing for your attention; in particular, you’re worried, you’re stressed about the big step and so I think with that off my plate, I have much more resources to dedicate to students, even though I’m objectively busier, but I’m less stressed by having to take that major step,” Chentsova-Dutton said.
Government professor Hans Noel, newly tenured, said that receiving tenure allows for more time to focus on creativity in the classroom.
“I can say, alright, this semester, I’m not worried about publishing anything, I’ll just get creative with this class and see what happens, so it’s liberating in that sense,” Noel said.
For both Marsh and history professor Michael David-Fox, the news of their promotions brings a feeling of relief.
“To be frank, I’m looking forward to not ever having to be promoted again. That’s the last time you have to go through these kinds of hurdles,” David-Fox said. “It’s kind of a nice feeling; you’ve gotten to the highest rank you can get and you can continue to do your work and do what you love doing.”
De Fina hopes that there will be better communication between the university and potential full professors on the processes that need to be taken for promotion.
“I wonder whether there will be a better description for people at Georgetown as to what they’re expected to do.” she said. “I understand that you can’t really put numbers or very specific details, but maybe the university could think of a forum or a website or something that collects the information and directs people towards what they need to do to become full professors.”
Chentsova-Dutton, who came to the United States as a high school exchange student during the collapse of the Soviet Union and did not know if she could attend college, keeps her tenure letter above her desk as a reminder of how far she has come.
“Having gone from not knowing and scrambling money by babysitting to go to community college to being given this position this position at Georgetown University, these kinds of moment make you realize the distances you’ve traveled,” Chentsova-Dutton said.

Over the last 30 years, the job market has gone through a fundamental shift, with young adults taking longer to settle into lasting careers and older adults taking longer to retire — a phenomenon the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce examined in a recent report.
The Sept. 30 report entitled “Failure to Launch: Structural Shift and the New Lost Generation,” showed that while previous models of employment have assumed entry into the job market at age 18 and exit at age 65, this range has been continually shifting toward older workers, particularly those who work in white-collar occupations and have a college degree.
In 1980, the average age to begin earning the nation-wide median wage was 26, compared to 30 in 2012. In addition, older adults are staying in the labor market longer, earning higher wages and accumulating more wealth than they did 30 years ago.
According to CEW Director Anthony Carnevale, one of the report’s co-authors, the fact that older workers are staying in the job market longer is not the cause of job shortages for recent graduates.
“If you’re in a job and you’re 65, the person you’re crowding out of that job is probably 55, not 25,” Carnevale said.
Rather, the increasingly longer time period required by young adults to settle into careers has been caused by a fundamental change in the structure of the labor market.
“The on-ramp [into the labor market] has become longer,” Carnevale said. “It’s more difficult. It requires increased educational attainment in order to get access to learning on the job and training on the job.”
Employers are demanding increased education and skill levels from employees than what they did 30 years ago because of the nation’s shift from a manufacturing economy to a service economy. According to the report, as technological innovations have replaced tasks that required human labor prior to 1980, employees have had to increasingly demonstrate expanded skill sets in order to compete for work.
While this change has increased the value of a college degree, it has also exacerbated the differences among college majors. Workers with lower-level degrees in higher-paying fields like science, technology, engineering and mathematics often earn more than people with higher-level degrees in less valuable fields.
According to Cawley Career Education Center Executive Director Michael Schaub, however, Georgetown alumni have shown a strong ability to adapt, regardless of their courses of study or their degrees. Schaub attributed this to Georgetown’s strong liberal arts education.
“Georgetown students can enter into almost any field with almost any major,” Schaub wrote in an email. “One advantage of a strong liberal arts education is the ability to be adaptable across job functions and industries during challenging economic times.”
In addition, the report also showed that women and minorities were more likely to choose college majors that traditionally lead to lower-paying jobs, while those who did choose majors targeted toward high-paying careers often still served in low-paying jobs.
As a result, there is a persistent wage gap between these groups and white men, but men have been most heavily impacted by the changes in the job market. Prior to 2000, 70 percent of workers tended to have, at most, high school degrees, and most of these workers were middle-class men who took blue-collar jobs that paid very well but did not require college degrees.
From 2000 to 2012, however, the employment rate for men between the ages of 26 and 30 dropped from 80 percent to 65 percent, while the rate for women in the same age range only dropped 6 percentage points from 56 percent to 50 percent.
In response to such changes in the job market, the report advocates for better preparation for young adults’ transition into the workforce, such as learning to balance work and education at an early stage in order to accelerate a move into a full-time career.

The Georgetown University Police Department held its first roundtable Wednesday evening.
The event, planned by Georgetown University Student Association Secretary of Student Health and Safety Nora West (SFS ’15) and GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), aimed to address common questions regarding GUPD.
West asked Chief of Police Jay Gruber and Deputy Chief Joseph Smith questions that had been submitted by students and addressed issues such as the Department of Public Safety’s name change to GUPD. Approximately 15 students were present to hear their responses.
“We wanted people to focus on what our core mission is: providing law enforcement,” Gruber said.
According to GUPD’s website, the unofficial shift was partly in an effort to distinguish Georgetown’s force from public safety departments at other universities, which also oversee services such as emergency management and environmental health and safety.
West also asked about GUPD’s negative public image on campus as a punitive agent rather than as a resource.
“People don’t send information about their negative experiences, so I don’t get information on what those negative interactions are,” Gruber said. “If I don’t know about those situations, I can’t take care of that.”
Smith added that many students incorrectly perceive GUPD’s role in monitoring student social life.
“An urban myth about our engagement in parties is that we are a party patrol,” Smith said. “We do not do that. When we come to a party, it’s invariably because somebody has called complaining that it’s gotten out of hand. We do not actively seek out parties.”
The discussion also touched on other subjects, such as clarifying GUPD’s sexual assault policy. According to Gruber, while GUPD has a mandate to alert the Metropolitan Police Department for all sexual assault cases, survivors are not required to go through the criminal justice process.
Gruber also reported that the rate of laptop theft has fallen dramatically from last year, with only one or two stolen so far.
Another issue brought up during the roundtable was GUPD’s relationship with Georgetown, as it is on the university’s pay-roll.
“My personal moral and ethical compass will not allow me to take action that is not morally or ethically right. So, if the university leadership would tell me, you need to unarrest that person, I can’t do it,” Gruber said. “Even though we are employed by the university and acting as agents for the university, it would be wrong on many levels and from a federal standpoint — the Clery Act requires us to report things that happen.”
The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, signed into law by former President George H.W. Bush, requires all schools to disclose information about crime on and around their campuses.
The roundtable also addressed the department’s role in student-neighbor relations.
“We don’t play sides,” Gruber said. “We have an obligation to ensure that our students act responsibly and are good citizens of the community, but I also think students have some rights in the city, and sometimes the neighbors are unreasonable.”
He added that neighbors should be cognizant and understanding of the type of environment in which they reside.
“They’ve now decided to live near a university,” Gruber said. “It brings a vibrant culture, it brings wonderful programming [and] it also brings 18- to 21-year-olds.”
At the end of the roundtable, Gruber said that he hoped to hold a roundtable once or twice every semester to address student concerns.

More than halfway through their term, Georgetown University Student Association President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) say they have fulfilled more than two-thirds of their campaign promises, but the pair has found difficulty in executing some key platform priorities.
Since taking office in April, the executive leaders have cited the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, which mandates that the university house 90 percent of undergraduates by fall 2025, as the greatest challenge of their term.
Soon after taking office in February, Tisa and Ramadan worked closely with the university on implementation of the campus plan, particularly with their appeal for student input in designing the Northeast Triangle residence hall and relaxing a variety of social policies on campus.
However, collaboration with university administrators has become strained since Tisa told campus media of the university’s consideration of a satellite residence.
“What we decided to do was something difficult, which was to call the administration out to hold them accountable on the promises they made after the campus plan,” Tisa said. “Our ability to do that was informed by looking back into the history and talking to alumni from GUSA who have said their biggest regret is prioritizing relationships with the administrators above relationships and duties with the students. We learned from that.”
Severe student backlash, channelled through a student body referendum that administrators condemned, fuelled this tension between the university and GUSA. Cause for dispute extended all the way to semantics, with university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr calling Tisa “absolutely mistaken” when he referred to the satellite residence as a satellite campus.
“Standing up for students but also knowing where to draw the line and where to compromise on things has certainly been a challenge,” Tisa said. “At the end of the day, you did see some negative reactions by a select few administrators, but they weren’t sustained because they didn’t have a place in cooperating to find acceptable solutions.”
Tisa gave Ramadan and himself a B-plus so far for the term, saying that there is still a lot left to do. He said that the executive staff and cabinet deserved an A for their performance.
Despite a delayed start in tackling the centerpiece of Tisa and Ramadan’s campaign platform — the expansion of free speech zones on campus — Ramadan is confident that the executive’s adjusted approach of reviewing the Speech and Expression Policy and revamping the committee that oversees the policy will best serve campus life.
“It will be a long-term plus for students,” Ramadan said.
Tisa and Ramadan also said that addressing access to benefits and space costs has replaced their original plan to divide the Student Activities Commission into specialized boards based on the nature of their constituent student groups.
During the GUSA executive election in February, running mates Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), a former SAC chair, and Maggie Cleary (COL ’14) proposed to overhaul the entire student activities funding system. Tisa and Ramadan oppose such action.
Appelbaum, who now serves as GUSA’s director of student space, maintains that an overall funding reform could benefit student groups but noted that such reforms would require extensive efforts from the current GUSA executives.
“I think parts of the funding system still need reform. I still think campus-wide there can be significant reform, and it can have a real positive impact on student life, but it’s not something that you can snap your fingers and it happens,” Appelbaum said. “I think it’s just how they prioritized things. It wasn’t a priority for them. That was just a difference in philosophy we had.”
Not all campaign initiatives advanced as planned. Tisa, the first openly gay student body president at Georgetown, made advocacy for gender-neutral housing a focus of his campaign but has encountered strong resistance from the university since taking office.
“It’s been very challenging personally as the first LGBT president to run into the fact that for reasons external to the well-being of the students, the university is very resistant to the idea of mixed-gender housing. That is probably a generational persuasion battle,” Tisa said.
Pushing for extension of “clear and convincing” as the burden of proof for Code of Student Conduct violations in off-campus incidents has also been difficult. As it stands now, off-campus incidents are still judged by the “more likely than not” evidentiary standard that governed on-campus infractions before last fall.
According to Tisa, the neighborhood has pursued harsher sanctions against noise violations.
“Next to gender-neutral housing, this is the only other issue that has been frustrating for us, because the neighborhood-relation and campus-plan situation has not been friendly to us getting this kind of basic protection to off-campus students,” Tisa said.
In addition to checking off several projects, including extending composting and recycling programs in all on-campus apartments, starting development of a Georgetown bike share program, adding the Code of Student Conduct to the Georgetown mobile app and compiling a document with centralized resources for students with disabilities, Tisa and Ramadan have also helped oversee the completion of several initiatives inherited from their predecessors. The Mission and Ministry Report, which began last fall, is in its last stages and the Office of Sustainability, an initiative that former GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) pushed for, was launched this summer.
GUSA has also seen an expansion of service to a wider student population through new cabinet positions.
Deputy Chief of Staff Alyssa Peterson (COL ’14) attributed the success of completing numerous projects to the working structures of the GUSA executive.
“Some of the secretaries who have been the most successful are the ones who have roles in other areas. Each of our staff [members] work closely and provide them the resources and connections for the ideas and projects that they already feel empowered to work on,” Peterson said.
Overall, Tisa emphasized that his greatest priority is ensuring the university hears students’ voices.
“The value of student input has proven itself and moving forward we will see a permanent shift where student input isn’t an option or something you do when you’re in trouble,” Tisa said. “It’s something that you do in the beginning.”
Ramadan, who called himself a “GUSA outsider” during the executive campaign last spring, said he has recognized that student government can be relevant to student life.
“Collectively as a block, students underestimate what we’re capable of doing and maybe that contributed to why I chose to get involved in many other things while never choosing to pursue GUSA,” Ramadan said. “I see now what the students have the capacity in doing things. Now, it’s just a matter of getting more students aware of that.”

The Southwest Quad has been experiencing major technical difficulties with its fire alarm system, with nine alarms going off between Sep. 25 and Oct. 11.
Although the specific cause for the malfunction is still unclear, the Office of Facilities has narrowed the problem down to low water pressure in the sprinkler system of the P1 floor of the parking garage, which is serviced by Loop One, one of 25 service loops between the hand-pull fire alarms, the smoke detectors, the sprinklers and other devices within the fire alarm system. Loop One is primarily located in the mechanical rooms and stairwells of SWQ.
“Within the building, there are over 900 devices, so we’re trying to track down the devices that we think are defective and replace them,” Vice President for Facilities and Planning Robin Morey said.
Morey stressed the complexity of the fire alarm system.
“There’s constant communication from a panel to the smoke detector on what’s happening, whether that’s heat detection, a hand pull, whatever,” Morey said. “These systems are constantly monitoring each other.”
To minimize the negative impact on the students residing in the three SWQ residence halls, the university took the automatic fire alarm activation system offline Oct. 11 and replaced it with a fire-watch system, conducted by Department of Public Safety officers. During the fire watch, smoke alarms and fire alarms will not automatically activate an audible alarm, as usually occurs. Rather, a signal will immediately display on a continuously monitored control panel, and one of two patrolling officers in the building will be dispatched to confirm the emergency. This officer will then manually sound the alarm if there is reasonable cause.
According to Morey, the fire watch will remain in place until the automatic alarm system has been fixed.
“I want it to be completely clear that the building is totally protected, and the occupants are not in any danger,” Morey said. “Really, for us, it’s about having [officers] there 24/7 when they really don’t need to be. We need to get the system operating independently.”
Georgetown technicians are working closely with Seimens, the system manufacturer and maintenance provider, and the Protection Engineering Group, a professional engineering group specializing in fire safety. Morey reported that the technicians have already made significant progress.
“We’re getting closer,” Morey said. “I wouldn’t be responsible if I said we know what the problem is, but we found some issues yesterday in one of the mechanical rooms. We took them out of service, and the system stabilized. We’ve also found some other anomalies since then.”
Facilities will re-evaluate the situation Monday.
Students expressed displeasure with the alarms.
“The ones that went off in the afternoon were OK, but the ones that went off at 5 a.m., they’re really irritating,” Reynolds resident Sung Sun (COL ’14) said. “There were a lot of emails saying to listen to the alarms and get out, but I’m pretty sure a lot of people weren’t listening,”
McCarthy resident Michelle Larson (NHS ’16) agreed.
“I never really knew if they were real or not, but as they started to happen more frequently, I started assuming they were fake,” Larson said. “It was actually dangerous — a lot of people weren’t leaving. We got a lot of emails saying to bear with them, but obviously it wasn’t a priority.”
SWQ residents have been receiving continuous informational emails from the Office of Planning and Facilities Management and the community directors of each of the residence halls.
“In each of those communications, students were reminded that an immediate evacuation is imperative anytime a fire alarm is activated,” Director of Residential Education Edward Gilhool said. “The health and safety of our residents is our highest priority.”

After a lackluster run last year, Georgetown Women in International Affairs is reviving its mentorship program by expanding its offerings to juniors and seniors.
The program will partner undergraduates interested in international affairs with female graduate students in the School of Foreign Service for lectures, workshops and networking events.
“We think it has great potential,” Women Leading Through Mentorship Planning Committee member Lindsey Hutchison (GRD ’15) said.
GWIA Co-President Jessica Majno (GRD ’14) stressed the importance of strong mentor-mentee relationships in the field of international affairs, citing the decision of moving abroad for a job.
“I have found having people to talk to that have been through those similar situations has been incredibly valuable, to talk about all those things, talk about careers, talk about school, talk about life,” Majno said.
In a field largely dominated by men, women often find themselves in uncomfortable situations when working in foreign countries that are less friendly toward women.
“I think that it still is sometimes difficult for women to work in international affairs depending on what part of the world it is, and sometimes in the United States as well, and I would have really benefited a lot from any advice an older woman could have given me from her experiences,” Hutchison said.
Hutchison added that she wished that she could have participated in a similar program as an undergraduate student.
“I think it’s always really important to be able to have a person in your life that can give you advice and who you can learn from, and also I think it would be a great experience for us as graduate women to be able to provide that for undergrads,” Hutchison said.
Majno agreed.
“I think as much as women have made great strides in their position in the professional field, and particularly in the field of international affairs, there’s still a ways to go,” Majno said. “We’re still not consistently among the top positions. The proportions are still in the favor of men.”
Women Leading Through Mentorship is currently limited to female participants, and interested students must fill out a survey, due Oct. 19, that will match them to a graduate student with similar interests. The survey covers academic interests, future career aspirations and regional interests, as well as languages.
“You want to get two people who can relate but can also challenge each other,” planning committee member Sarah Ewing (GRD ’15) said.
Each student pair will most likely meet a few times for coffee or similar activities, but the exact time commitment is entirely up to the students.
“It’s really what you make of it, how much you can put into it, and I think that even a little bit of time would be really beneficial,” Hutchison said.
Majno said that she hoped to see more female graduate students get involved, take up mentoring roles and engage the community in service.
“It’s an opportunity for me to give back to the Georgetown community,” Majno said.

Nine campus organizations ranging from Alpha Phi Omega to Students of Georgetown, Inc. will sponsor the 2013 Georgetown Walk for the Homeless this Sunday in Red Square.
All of the walk’s proceeds will benefit the Georgetown Ministry Center, which uses street outreach and community education to help guide homeless individuals to stable living situations.
“The Help the Homeless walk is one of our biggest fundraisers, and it is vital for us because we receive little government funding,” GMC Outreach Director Roy Witherspoon said. “We rely mostly on corporate sponsors, individual donations and events like this to keep our doors open seven days a week, 365 days a year.”
GMC operates centers serving the homeless in Georgetown and Foggy Bottom, where guests can shower, do laundry, talk to a case manager, see a general practitioner and psychiatrist, use the computer, obtain new clothes and participate in educational programming.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s Help the Homeless program, which has raised over $100 million for homeless men, women and children since 1988, is bringing the walk to campus. The nonprofit group’s goal is to provide shelter for the nearly 12,000 homeless in the Washington, D.C. area by raising funds for local organizations and spreading awareness. The Center for Social Justice, Research, Teaching and Service and Georgetown Business Improvement District have also helped organize the event.
Participants, whose $20 registration directly benefits GMC, will choose between a two kilometer walk or a five kilometer run through the Georgetown campus and surrounding neighborhood. The event will kick off in Red Square at 11 a.m. with registration, a blessing and a keynote speech. After the run and walk, there will be a celebratory barbecue and prizes for the fastest male and female runners.
Hoyas Outreach Programs and Education President Philip Sidoti (MSB ’14) said that the support from Georgetown community groups helps increase the event’s impact for the local homeless community.
“H.O.P.E. has been involved in the Help the Homeless Walk for several years now, and we are proud to now have the walk taking place on campus for a second consecutive year. The help that we have received from student groups has been incredible,” he said. “Our work with GMC representatives has gone very well. We are looking forward to seeing a lot of Georgetown students participate on Sunday.”
Among the student groups directly helping with the walk are the Georgetown University Grilling Society, which will be doing the barbecue, and WGTB, which will be MCing the event.
Students have expressed excitement about participating in the event.
“The Graduate Student Organization sent out an email with information about the walk/run, and it seemed like a small way to do something positive in support of helping others,” runner Julianna Carney (GRD ’16) said.
