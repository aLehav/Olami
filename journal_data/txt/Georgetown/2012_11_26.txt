Electronics were stolen from residences in Copley Hall this afternoon, according to a Department of Public Safety alert.
At approximately 3 p.m., several students returned to their rooms to find that their laptops and cell phones were missing.
They had reportedly left their doors unlocked and were not present at the time the crime was committed.
DPS and the Metropolitan Police Department are investigating the incident.
