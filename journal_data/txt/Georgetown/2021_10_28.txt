The Corp and the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union (GUASFCU) launched a partnership Oct. 18 to raise money for Georgetown University Mutual Aid (GU Mutual Aid) by selling matcha lattes.
During the event, Matcha for Mutual Aid, which took place from Oct. 18 to 22, GUASFCU, a student-run credit union, matched money made by sales of matcha latte drinks sold at various Corp locations. Ultimately, the partnership was able to raise over $1,000, according to Matt Davis (SFS ’22), CEO of The Corp.
The Corp chose to launch Matcha for Mutual Aid in order to help advocate on behalf of GU Mutual Aid, according to Davis.
“We know that we occupy a really special role in Georgetown because we do have legitimacy being in the form of a business, and we can use that to advocate on behalf of students and commit real change, specifically monetary incentives for student groups who don’t have the business element that we do,” Davis said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. 
GUASFCU chose to partner with The Corp to support GU Mutual Aid and the broader Georgetown community, according to Victoria Smith (COL ’22), chief marketing officer of GUASFCU.
“The Corp is one of our Rewards partners at GUASFCU and being another club on campus we wanted to do something meaningful together. Both institutions offer unique services to students on campus and we wanted to do something that gave back to the whole community,” Smith wrote in a message to The Hoya. “Mutual Aid plays such a crucial role in supporting students on campus and we wanted to contribute to their efforts.”
The Corp tracked matcha sales through their point-of-sale system on their storefront iPads, which showed an increase in matchas sold, according to Davis.
The large amount of money donated to GU Mutual Aid represents the Georgetown community’s strong support for mutual aid, according to Davis.
“We totally surpassed $1,000 by the end of the week, so definitely an increase in orders,” Davis said. “It definitely doesn’t mean more people want matcha — it shows that students really want to give to Mutual Aid and recognize that this is one of the strongest things to come out of COVID.”
GU Mutual Aid is grateful to those who participated in the event, according to GU Mutual Aid Co-Founder Megan Huynh (NHS ’22). 
“Because we’ve been running low on funds, we’re really grateful for the Corp and GUASFCU for hosting Matcha for Mutual Aid, as well as everyone who bought matcha this past week to support us,” Huynh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “All the money will go directly back into supporting Georgetown students in need of funding for their basic needs like groceries and clothing.”
Since classes began this semester, GU Mutual Aid has received an influx of requests from students on campus. As a result, GU Mutual Aid has been forced to close its request form multiple times because of a lack of community donations.
In the past, when GU Mutual Aid closed its request form, student organizations on campus, including The Corp, launched initiatives to support donations to the organization. Last spring, The Corp and GU Mutual Aid collaborated to collect and distribute unused Flex dollars, which can be used at dining locations on campus, to help curb campus food insecurity. GUASFCU and The Corp originally agreed to host Matcha for Mutual Aid in February 2021, according to Davis. 
Supporting GU Mutual Aid is a cause that should continue to grow, according to Rosalind Tran (NHS ’22), who bought matcha during the event. 
“I thought that if my flex dollars were to go towards anything, Matcha for Mutual Aid would be a pretty good one,” Tran wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I would like to see support for GU Mutual Aid grow going forward.”
GUASFCU considers the initiative a success and hopes to collaborate with GU Mutual Aid in the future, according to Smith.
“Mutual Aid is such an important organization on campus and considering how well this fundraiser went I think there is a lot of potential to collaborate with them in the future,” Smith wrote. “We would love to work with Mutual Aid more and hear from them on how best we can help and learn more about how we can collectively contribute to the community.”
Collaborations between GU Mutual Aid and other campus organizations are powerful community-building tools, according to Huynh. 
“Collaborating with on-campus organizations is one of the best ways for us to build community with one another, while also spreading the mission of Georgetown Mutual Aid,” Huynh wrote.

Content Warning: This article discusses clerical sexual abuse. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
The Roman Catholic Church, as well as society at large, has a responsibility to create networks of support and foster empathy for survivors of clerical sexual abuse, panelists said at an Oct. 25 event. 
The virtual event, titled “Lifting Up the Voices of Female Survivors of Clergy Sexual Abuse,”invited four survivors of clerical sexual abuse to share their perspectives on preventing future abuse. The event was co-sponsored by the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace & World Affairs, the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought in Public Life, the Office of Mission and Ministry, the Georgetown Law Office of Mission and Ministry, the Human Flourishing Program at Harvard University, and Awake Milwaukee. 
Survivors of sexual abuse need to know that their body’s traumatic response is a form of protection, according to panelist Kathryn Walczyk, a spiritual companion, writer and survivor of clergy sexual abuse. 
“It’s natural to me to share what happens to the body and to know how my body was not against me,” Walczyk said at the event. “To learn the trauma science, that my body was learning to protect me. It wanted to save me from this spiritual injury. That’s why I responded in trauma.”
Sexual violence can have psychological and physical effects on a survivor. Post-traumatic stress disorder and feelings of anxiety, stress or fear are typical after a traumatic event and can make adjusting afterward difficult, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.
Dr. Deborah Rodriguez, a pediatrician with expertise in trauma-informed care and a survivor of clergy sexual abuse, called for greater societal attention to supporting survivors.
“There are superheroes everywhere in the world, but they have the worst superpower, and that is invisibility,” Rodriguez said at the event. “In other words, we can’t see these beautiful gems of people right in front of us. Much like the survivors before us, we are hidden in plain sight.”
In December 2018, the Illinois state attorney general office identified child sexual abuse accusations against at least 500 Catholic priests or clergy members not publicly named by the church, many of which were not properly investigated. In July 2020, the Vatican published guidelines for clergy to report cases of sexual abuse. 
Georgetown University has reckoned with its own connections to clerical sexual abuse in recent years. There are currently 16 publicly known church officials accused of sexual assault that are affiliated with Georgetown. In September 2021, multiple survivors came forward against former Provost Donald J. Freeze, following initial allegations from an individual survivor in June 2021 that resulted in administrators revoking Freeze’s honorary degree. 
The Catholic Church must have empathy for survivors in order to solve the clergy sexual abuse crisis, according to panelist Carol Longsdorf, an elementary school teacher and survivor of clergy sexual abuse.
“Few people in the world respond with empathy,” Longsdorf said at the event. “So few people, especially within the church, respond to trauma with empathy. Empathy must be trained and taught because it’s not being taught in our culture.”
In order for women to feel comfortable reporting sexual abuse by clergy officials, the patriarchal nature of the church must be changed, according to Rodriguez.
“I cannot ignore the big elephant in the room,” Rodriguez said. “We live in a church, a Catholic Church, that is male-dominated. And no matter how holy or wonderful or well-meaning that male person is, there’s still a hierarchy. So imagine if female voices came out sharing our talents and our voices. That would be amazing for our church.”
The Catholic Church does not allow women to join clerical ranks, resulting in an all-male hierarchy. In November 2016, Pope Francis stated that the rule against women’s ordination is likely to last forever. Church reform organizations globally have been pushing for women’s ordination for decades, including the Women’s Ordination Conference, which staged protests at the gates of the Vatican in October 2018. 
Rodriguez called on society at large to create a safe environment for survivors of sexual abuse by inviting them to tell their stories when they are ready. 
“What can we do?” Rodriguez said. “First of all, just listen. I’d use Kathryn’s word ‘invite.’ Invite. We don’t have to wait for the bishops and the priests and everyone else. Just, as one another, invite. Invite stories. Invite safety. And then recognize that those of us who have a trauma history are coming with a wound that may still be unhealed.”

Four new establishments have opened in the Western Market Food Hall since September as part of the building’s continued redevelopment and renovation.
Western Market, a public food space located on The George Washington University’s (GWU) main campus, opened in late September with the four offerings: RAWish, a vegan vendor; Roaming Rooster, a fried chicken restaurant; Capo Deli, a sandwich place; and Mason’s Famous Lobster Rolls, a lobster and seafood shop. The market additionally plans to open four stalls later this fall, with four more coming in the winter.
According to Tim Hill, vice president of investments for MidAtlantic Realty Partners (MRP) and the developer for Western Market, the combination of different types of vendors was important for the vision for the space.  
“We wanted a really eclectic mix of vendors, in terms of price point, regions and health,” Hill said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We really thought carefully about getting the balance right so that we have a really healthy blend here.”
Housed in a market building constructed in 1802, Western Market features patio seating, socially distanced seating options and large open spaces. 
Michael Habtemariam, co-owner of Roaming Rooster, chose to open his fourth location in Western Market because of past success in the area. 
“We started out as a food truck, and our food truck used to come by GW and used to do really, really good,” Habtemariam said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “A lot of the students liked our food, so I think it’s a prime location for us.”
According to James Yarborough, co-owner of RAWish, the students and The George Washington University Hospital community will enjoy the type of food that RAWish offers.
“I think particularly with the campus community, the younger population is tending to focus on healthy eating in general, and plant based makes up a decent percentage of that,” Yarborough said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Also being near a hospital, that tends to have a population that wants to eat healthy.”
Aside from various food options, Western Market hopes to offer other community bonding activities like yoga classes and wine tastings, according to Hill.
“We are focused on getting the rest of the retailers that we’ve leased to open,” Hill said. “We’re also continuously filling out our events calendar and creating different ways to bring people to the market to build a community here.”
Recent events offered by Western Market include movie nights, live music on the patio, yoga and wine nights. All events were open to the public, though visitors were required to comply with local COVID-19 guidelines, according to Western Market’s website. 
With all the food options and events at Western Market, Habtemariam hopes that students will continue to support Western Market as the food market continues to expand. 
“I think it’ll be a really good spot for students to come out and try a different variety of foods,” Habtemariam said. “Once everything is open, it is going to be a good deal.” 
Upcoming openings this fall and winter include Greek street food restaurant Alitiko, Guatemalan street food restaurant Nim Ali, Venezuelan restaurant Arepa Zone, Southeast Asian restaurant Bandoola Bowl and Japanese restaurant Sushi Onkei. 
Although Western Market is located in Foggy Bottom, it is a space where people from all over the District, including Georgetown University, can gather, according to Yarborough.
“We’re really looking forward to partnering with the Georgetown community,” Yarborough said. “We’re not that far from Georgetown, so we hope to get kids who come over for a break from their usual dining options.”
According to Hill, Western Market provides delicious food options and a perfect setting to build community in Foggy Bottom. 
“We want a group of customers to come, and everyone can get something that they love and then meet up at a table, hang out and spend the afternoon there,” Hill said.

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) executive is focused on crisis management and implementing long-term positive change for vulnerable communities on campus, according to the Blass-Sanchez administration. 
GUSA President Nile Blass (COL ’22) and Vice President Nicole Sanchez (SFS ’22) were first elected during the 2021 GUSA executive elections. Since assuming office in May 2021, the pair has overseen advocacy efforts as the larger Georgetown student body has returned to campus for the first time in two years.
Blass and Sanchez joined The Hoya in an Oct. 25 Q&A to discuss their administration’s successes over halfway through their term, the ongoing projects they are leading, as well as their goals for the remainder of their time as GUSA executives. Below is an excerpt from the interview. For a more complete overview of the interview, please refer to The Hoya’s podcast recap of the Q&A.
The following has been edited for length and clarity.
What has been your administration’s biggest accomplishment? What was the biggest challenge you faced in accomplishing this, and how did you overcome it? 
Blass: A lot of this semester has been emergency needs, things that weren’t predicted. So I’m proud of everything that we’ve done, but it’s very important for me to be doing tangible and deliberate work, and I think that a lot of times GUSA can be doing things behind the scenes having a lot of dialogues, but what the student body is actually able to receive and meaningfully engage in is limited. I think that the work that we did from February when we first took office into now is the CARES Act one, two and then the ARP Act. I think that financial restitution for students who are struggling not just as it relates to the pandemic and those circumstances, but as it relates to just different experiences and perspectives with which people have to come into Georgetown and have to try and engage in this educational environment. 
Sanchez: One of the biggest challenges about being in GUSA in general is that you’re always constantly responding to crisis and a lot of times the infrastructure of how the school works, and then also just the club that we are in really prevents us sometimes from pushing a lot of work that’s not crisis work aside. I would say that one of our biggest achievements, at least for me, is the financial assistance that just came out for meal plans. I say it is a big achievement for us because we worked on it for months. 
How has working with the university administration been?
Sanchez: We do surveys, we collect information and we share those testimonies with students allowing us to, to say hey, ‘This is what students are telling us,’ and administrators tell us straight to our face to stop exaggerating, using hyperboles, basically calling us liars during meetings. They have downplayed student feelings and emotions. There’s a really big thing in regards to liability with administrators where any negative thing that happens to any student on campus, the school can be held liable for, so they’re very specific on how they take accountability, which is something we’ve really had issues with: accountability and communication.
What have you yet to accomplish that you hope to do before the end of your term? 
Sanchez: Two of the things that I’m extremely passionate about and we’re kind of already working on are one, mental health and leave of absence. I know there’s a lot of controversy about how that gets done in relation to CAPS and GUPD and Georgetown’s Hospital and their mental health ward, because a lot of students have had negative experiences, including me, and that can be very traumatizing and negatively affecting the academic record. The system that’s in place creates that really toxic and negative experience for students is institutionalized and in the system that exists. A big part of what I want to do is work on fixing that and addressing leave of absence and forced leave of absence, and how students are kind of coerced into it. I’m standing by this because I’ve experienced this and I’ve heard many other students with the same experience.Blass: Georgetown banks on the idea that we leave in four years. So, even if we give them the worst four years of their lives, John DeGoia, Joseph Ferrara, all the other individuals, regardless of our personal relationships with them or whether they’re amicable and supportive of the work that we’re doing, we leave. So they can stay, they can write us out and even with the GU272 and are doing so much more work on that. One of my biggest priorities is the change that withstands after we’re gone because a lot of other things rely on the people who are coming after us not being focused and engaged and following up on everything else that we’re doing.

Washington, D.C. residents can choose to commute via bicycle for free amid recent Metro delays and disruptions thanks to a new initiative established by city officials. 
Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced a partnership with Lyft on Oct. 25 to launch free 30-day Capital Bikeshare memberships for District residents to alleviate transit disruptions caused by currently limited Metro services. District residents can register for a membership on the Capital Bikeshare or Lyft apps, allowing them to ride the classic model Capital Bikeshare bike for up to 45 minutes free of charge.
The move comes after the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) removed 60% of its Metro trains as part of ongoing investigations following the derailment of a train on the Blue Line on Oct. 12. As a result, trains are delayed, with some lines running only every 30 minutes, leaving riders frustrated about delays and derailments. WMATA is uncertain about when full service will return, according to WUSA9.  
The transit delays are an inconvenience for District residents who rely on the Metro to travel and commute, according to an Oct. 25 news release from Bowser.
“The service disruptions at Metro are deeply troubling for DC and the region,” Bowser said in the press release. “DC is open and we need a fully functioning transit system to get workers, students, and visitors across the city.” 
WMATA is working to restore service while prioritizing commuter safety, according to an Oct. 22 news release from Paul J. Wiedefeld, Metro CEO and general manager.
“We understand it has been a difficult week for people who depend on Metro in the region, and acknowledge the challenges our customers are experiencing,” Wiedefeld said in the press release. “We are working as quickly and safely as possible to inspect every wheel on the 7000-series railcars and it’s important to get that right.”
While District residents wait to return to their usual commutes and transportation options, the Capital Bikeshare membership will make the District more accessible, according to Everett Lott, interim director of the District Department of Transportation (DDOT).
“This initiative will help District residents by lowering the barriers to entry for sustainable transit that operates 24/7 from over 300 Stations within the District and over 600 stations throughout the region,” Lott wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The District has over 5,000 pedal bikes and 1,000 e-bikes in the region, enough to support the influx of new registrations since the initiative was announced Oct. 25, according to Lott.
While D.C. residents will be able to use the Capital Bikeshare services for only 45 minutes at a time, if riders wish to exceed the period of free service, they will receive a 33% discount for the extra ride time, which is calculated and paid for by the minute.
According to Lott, the free membership does not pose an additional cost to the District and any lost revenue is expected to be recovered in the long run.
“There is no added cost to the District for the free one-month Capital Bikeshare memberships for District Residents,” Lott wrote. “While we may forego revenue that we would receive from membership sales with the 30-day free membership subscription, we anticipate recovering that revenue from other sources like station advertisements and new membership sales from these new subscribers in the long term.”
Capital Bikeshare is a DDOT-funded program available in the District, as well as other areas in Maryland and Virginia. All of Capital Bikeshare’s jurisdictions additionally contract with Lyft in order to provide the service, and riders can pay by the minute, day or month to use Capital Bikeshare bikes. 
In addition to the Capital Bikeshare announcement, Helbiz, an electric scooter company that offers services in the District, waived its $1 scooter unlocking fee until Nov. 30 in an effort to help District residents access other transportation options.  
Still, the District hopes to expand Capital Bikeshare services beyond the Oct. 25 initiative, with plans to invest in additional Capital Bikeshare stations and bikes, as well as the construction of more bike paths and lanes throughout the city.  
The Oct. 25 Capital Bikeshare initiative serves as the continuation of the District’s commitment to affordable and available transit options, according to Bowser. 
“We have been intentional, over the past several years, about making Capital Bikeshare more accessible and convenient for DC residents, and now we are proud to be able to offer this free one-month membership to every Washingtonian who might need it,” Bowser said in the press release.

The Georgetown University Prisons and Justice Initiative (PJI) is relaunching a partnership with the D.C. Mayor’s Office on Returning Citizen Affairs (MORCA) to prepare formerly incarcerated people for careers as paralegals.  
In collaboration with Georgetown University’s School of Continuing Studies (SCS) and the D.C. Department of Employment Services (DOES), the MORCA-Georgetown Paralegal Program will provide students with professional training and work experience in the field of law. This semester, the second class of fellows will complete 12 courses on topics such as legal research and writing, contracts, litigation, ethics and criminal law.
Programs like the MORCA-Georgetown Paralegal Program are important because they empower returning citizens with valuable job skills and experiences, according to SCS Dean Kelly Otter. 
“My hope for the program is that we continue to provide a values-based, respectful learning environment: one that empowers returning citizens as they gain new skills and build new professional lives,” Otter wrote in an email to The Hoya. “SCS is proud to support the program by providing its expertise and faculty in the paralegal field.”
The creation of the MORCA-Georgetown Paralegal Program is an embodiment of Georgetown’s value of helping others, according to PJI Director Marc Howard. 
“Georgetown has a rich history of service and outreach to incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people,” Howard said. “The university’s value of ‘people for others’ compels us to support our neighbors who are returning or recently returned from incarceration.”
The D.C. Mayor’s Office and the DOES did not respond when contacted by The Hoya.
Following the completion of the 16-week program in December, fellows will earn a certificate in paralegal studies from the SCS and will be matched with one-year paid fellowship positions at law firms, nonprofits and government agencies.
The fellowship programs offer employment opportunities not typically available to returning citizens, according to Marcus Dantley, a fellow in this semester’s program. 
“These programs are monumental for returning citizens because the potential places of employment are degrading for individuals with little to no experience, certifications, or skills,” Dantley wrote in an email to The Hoya. “When I learned I was selected, it truly felt like I earned it.”
Formerly incarcerated people in the United States often face higher barriers to employment. Returning citizens have a 27% unemployment rate — nearly five times higher than the general public’s unemployment. Up to 60% of formerly incarcerated individuals remain unemployed one year after their release, while some begin jobs in the food service industry, construction or warehouse operations.
The MORCA-Georgetown Paralegal Program helps fellows overcome employment challenges that are typical for returning citizens, according to Howard.
“Many returning citizens find themselves taking the first job they can find to make ends meet,” Howard wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This program is an opportunity for students to invest their time in building the skills and networks they need, and it also provides a direct link to paid, full-time employment.”
Nine students graduated in the first cohort in the 2018-19 year, and most were hired to permanent positions after their one-year fellowships. Five graduates also returned to the program to help mentor current participants and provide guidance based on their experiences. 
However, even though they have academic support and mentors within the program, formerly incarcerated individuals still have a hard transition back into the workforce and classroom, according to Dantley.
“Some of the biggest challenges are readjusting to a different way of doing things,” Dantley wrote. “It’s very hard to go from survival mode surrounded by predators to study mode surrounded by nerds.”
Still, despite the difficult transition, the MORCA-Georgetown Paralegal Program has a great impact in helping returning citizens develop new skills and implement them in fields they choose, according to Howard. 
“Returning citizens represent a wealth of knowledge and leadership that is so often underutilized,” Howard said. “Initiatives like the Pivot Program and the Paralegal Program create an opportunity for participants to overcome some of the barriers they face and build the kind of future they want for themselves.”

What an extraordinary program being offered by Georgetown. To offer the training,  then arrange for paid internships, and then for some to even return to mentor the next class. This program should be replicated across the country. Would certainly reduce the recidivism rate and ultimately reduce the incarcerated. Congratulations to Georgetown and all involved in providing this vital service.

Washington, D.C.-based activist groups have launched the #DecrimPovertyDC campaign aimed at decriminalizing drug use.
The #DecrimPovertyDC campaign, made up of a coalition of local organizations, including D.C. Justice Lab, the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) and Honoring Individual Power and Strength (HIPS), launched Oct. 21 and aims to decriminalize and destigmatize drug use and possession as well as urge the Council of the District of Columbia to allocate more resources toward support and rehabilitation for drug users. The group has launched a letter-writing campaign to the D.C. city council, encouraging it to take action to decriminalize and destigmatize drug use.
The goal of #DecrimPovertyDC is to destigmatize crimes that are often associated with poverty, according to Jeremiah-Anthony Righteous-Rogers, a spokesperson for HIPS, a group that organizes compassionate harm reduction services, advocacy and engagement events for communities impacted by sex work and drug use.
“The goal of #DecrimPovertyDC is to decriminalize poverty by working to end stigma, violence, criminalization, and other forms of oppression against people who are target by the state for ‘crimes of poverty,’ including drug use, sex work, housing insecurity, ciritzenship station and incarceration history,” Righteous-Rogers wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Black people are arrested for drug use and possession at a much higher rate than white people in the District. In 2017, 92% of people arrested for marijuana distribution and 75% of people arrested for public consumption were Black. 
According to Queen Adesuyi, policy manager for national affairs for DPA, an organization that seeks to reduce the harms of drug use and drug prohibition, the #DecrimPovertyDC campaign seeks to change the narrative regarding drug use, specifically for Black and underresourced communities. 
“The goals of the #DecrimPovertyDC campaign are multifaceted — we are a grassroots campaign focused on dismantling DC’s war on drugs, which has disproportionately impacted Black and underresourced communities the hardest,” Adesuyi wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are in a state of compounded emergencies — between overdose, COVID-19, and housing insecurity.” 
According to Patrice Sulton, executive director of D.C. Justice Lab, an organization that advocates for changes to the District’s criminal legal system through law and policy work, decriminalization gives power back to people.
“Any time you decriminalize anything, whether it’s drugs or sex work, you’re changing the breadth of authority that police officers, prosecutors and prisons have to inflict state violence on the community,” Sulton said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Decriminalization is moving power away from state actors back to the community.”
Adesuyi said the launch of the #DecrimPovertyDC campaign calls upon D.C. Council to take actions that help, rather than punish, drug users.
“We are urging for the DC Council to urgently shift how we address drug use and misuse away from a criminal legal issue and actually center evidence-based, public health approaches,” Adesuyi wrote. “For us, this starts by decriminalizing personal use quantities for all drugs, addressing collateral consequences related to drug convictions, and radically investing in harm reduction and public health infrastructures.”
In 2017, D.C. faced one of its deadliest years for overdose-related fatalities. As a result, D.C. Council voted to legalize the distribution and use of fentanyl test strips. Unknown consumption of fentanyl often contributes to overdose fatalities; these test strips allow individuals to test substances for the synthetic opioid. 
D.C. Justice Lab is assisting the #DecrimPovertyDC campaign by advocating for change regarding the decriminalization of drugs from the perspective of policy and the law.
“We are helping spread the word to our networks and other people who are either advocates like us or community members interested in our work and trying to help people shape and inform and push for smarter drug laws here,” Sulton said. 
As a result of the efforts of DPA and other advocacy groups, the D.C. Council passed a bill in 2020 that decriminalized drug paraphernalia and permitted organizations to hand out harm reduction supplies, which make drug use safer. 
There is support for additional decriminalization efforts in the District, according to Adesuyi, who hopes the #DecrimPovertyDC campaign could turn that support into real policy change.
“It’s no small deal that 83% of Washingtonians support removing criminal penalties for drug possession and investing in health services,” Adesuyi wrote. “This policy is not radical, it is common sense.”
A focus on decriminalization will create a path toward support and compassion, according to Adesuyi.
“It’s time that we stop punishing and stigmatizing people for using drugs, and instead meet people where they are by offering support and resources,” Adesuyi wrote.

Student activists gathered outside the Supreme Court for 24 hours protesting the Texas Heartbeat Act.  
The 496 Abortion Rally, named for the average number of miles someone living in Texas must travel to get an abortion after the passage of the Texas Heartbeat Act last month, was organized by Georgetown University College Democrats (GUCD) and H*yas for Choice and began at midnight Oct. 23. Over 50 students and community members participated in shifts at the demonstration throughout the day. 
The rally helped to raise awareness about the Texas law on campus, according to GUCD vice chair and advocacy director Nico Reyes (COL ’24), who helped to organize the rally. 
“By being there for 24 hours, by bringing out so many people to go protest, by spreading our message all over social media, by getting people to talk about it, we made this an issue on campus,” Reyes said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We made people talk about it. We made people get educated on it. Those individual events cause ripples.”  
The Texas Senate Bill 8, which came into effect Sept. 1, prohibits abortion in most cases and as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. The law also prohibits abortions in cases of rape or incest and allows private individuals to sue abortion providors. The Supreme Court has repeatedly refused to block the law; instead, the court has opted to fast-track appeals from the Department of Justice and abortion rights providers in Texas. 
Reyes said in addition to rasing awareness on campus, the protest was also to protect abortion rights nationwide. 
“What was terrifying about this bill being passed is not only did it affect women in Texas, but it opened the door for every other U.S. state to follow,” Reyes said. “I was incredibly disappointed to see that the Supreme Court didn’t act.” 
Individuals outside of the Georgetown community attended the rally, including students from George Washington University, American University as well as Carleah Summers, a Democratic candidate running to represent Maryland’s 6th District, according to Reyes. 
Reyes said organizers chose the Supreme Court because of the institution’s history as a place for activists to gather and inspire change. 
“It was pretty incredible to be sitting in the same spot as people who have demanded change throughout history,” Reyes said. 
People who do not live in Texas have a duty to advocate for those whose abortions rights are under attack, according to GUCD treasurer Sarah Ackels (MSB ’24), who attened the rally. 
“As a woman in Washington D.C., I’m really grateful that I have access to abortion health care, but I definitely have a responsibility to advocate for those who don’t,” Ackels said in a phone interview with The Hoya.  
Since the law took effect, abortion rights activists across the country have pushed for abortion protection on the federal level, with the Women’s March holding an abortion rights rally last month at the steps of the Supreme Court. 
Ackels said people must pay attention to the Supreme Court and vote in midterm elections to protect abortion rights. 
“Advocacy in any form is never over. I think that being aware and staying on top of what the Supreme Court is doing about this is really imporant, and I also think that voting in midterm elections can have a high impact on the legislation that gets passed in the future with regard to abortion rights,” Ackels said. 
It is vital people advocate for abortion rights, according to Nico Hwang (COL ’23), who participated in the rally. 
“We do care about this, we do think that this is an important thing and we do think that this needs to change,” Hwang said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I personally think it’s the right thing to do, to advocate for this particular right.”
Reyes said he believes protests have the power to influence future political decisions. 
“I know activism can change people, and I want to be a part of that change,” Reyes said.

Dancers with The Washington Ballet returned to the stage last week for their first indoor live performance since February 2020.  
The Washington Ballet kicked off the 2021-22 season with the Opening Performance Celebration at the National Building Museum on Oct. 21 and 22. Dancers showcased their talent for their largest in-person audience since the COVID-19 pandemic forced The Washington Ballet to suspend in-person training and performances. 
Returning to stage after such a long hiatus was an emotional and fulfilling experience for Adelaide Clauss, a company dancer with The Washington Ballet, who was thrilled to perform on a stage once again.
“The whole experience was really quite magical; there is something about being on a dark stage with stage lights and an audience that is impossible to replicate,” Clauss wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It was also very gratifying to be able to do it as an entire company, and seeing all of my colleagues up onstage and creating something together with them was wonderful.”
The company had to repurpose the National Building Museum, a museum in Penn Quarter dedicated to architecture and design, into a performance space that could accommodate the company, according to Catherine Eby, the artistic operations manager at The Washington Ballet. 
“One of the things that’s so interesting about our first performance being at the National Building Museum is it’s not a traditional theater space,” Eby said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We built the theater from scratch, we installed all of the seating, we put all of the numbers on the chairs and we did the tickets ourselves, so all of the things that you walk into a theater and you see as an audience member and as a dancer we created from the ground up.” 
According to Eby, the dancers performed a variety of ballet pieces in the Opening Performance Celebration that catered to audience members of all ages. 
“It was structured a bit like a gala performance,” Eby said. “It really covered all of the audience members’ love of ballet but also showcased our dancers and their true breadth of experiences in a new and really beautiful way.”
The 2021-22 season includes additional performances like “Swan Lake,” “Giselle” and “NEXTsteps.”
The Washington Ballet is also preparing for its performances of “The Nutcracker” this holiday season, which is a traditional audience favorite, according to Gian Carlo Perez, a company dancer with The Washington Ballet.
“We just started this week with rehearsals, and that’s really exciting because we have families coming to watch the shows every year,” Perez said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It’s one of the special moments of the year, because you get to reconnect with that holiday spirit during Christmas.”
As a result of COVID-19 safety precautions, dancers have been practicing at home and performing virtually, so the return of in-person performances is a welcomed improvement, according to Perez.
“For the last year and a half, before we returned to the studios, we were training here in our homes and taking classes in living rooms and dining rooms, so that was really challenging,” Perez said. “When you go to stage, to a performance again, you get to be exposed in front of an audience, and you get to do what you trained all your life for again.”
The dancers and choreographers had to work hard to make sure that their performances were ready for the stage and the audience, according to Clauss.
“Even when we came back to the studios, it was still a long trajectory to actually get to the place of live performance,” Clauss wrote. “I am so grateful to the audience and our supporters for turning up and supporting us at our performances, because it has been a very long path to get back to in-person performing, and now we have finally gotten there together.”
According to Eby, the Opening Performance Celebration was a wonderful return to the stage for The Washington Ballet, both for the dancers and the audience.
“I think it was the perfect culmination of the anxiety and nerves of returning to the stage but also the absolute elation of witnessing your hard work and the appreciation from the audience,” Eby said. “It was a really beautiful outcome of all of those things together.”

Hand-painted bonbons and rich butter cookies line the dessert cases at Petite Soeur, a new chocolate shop in the Georgetown neighborhood.
Ashleigh Pearson, an accomplished pastry chef and chocolatier, hosted a soft opening for the first physical Petite Soeur storefront Oct. 26. Pearson’s shop offers nine signature flavored hand-painted bonbons, butter sable cookies and wrapped confections at its 1332 Wisconsin Ave. location. 
The soft opening served as a way for the staff at Petite Soeur to adjust to business on a smaller scale. Pearson called the opening a success.
“People came just because they saw that we were inside working,” Pearson said. “They felt welcome to come inside, and people had great reception to the bonbons.”
Pearson, whose childhood dream was to be a veterinarian, originally studied biology as an undergraduate at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Her career took a turn when she got a job at Marcel’s, working under Michelin-star chef Robert Wiedmaier. She started as a pastry chef and spent the next decade climbing the ladder to eventually open her own chocolate shop. 
Pearson is optimistic that even though she switched to a focus on chocolate within the last four years, she can thrive as a classical chocolatier.   
“I guess I feel that makes me newer to it, but I’m still excited about it,” Pearson said. “I feel like I’m bringing a fresh perspective, and I have put in the time to really learn the foundations and the classics and how to produce a really technically sound chocolate and bonbon.”
Petite Soeur’s goal is to serve high-quality chocolates and French desserts in a separate atmosphere from the fine dining experience, Pearson said.
“Guests were enjoying these high-end chocolates but only at the end of a Michelin-star, fine-dining meal,” Pearson said. “I had the idea that I think it would be great to take this product out of this environment and put it in a more casual retail environment so that everyone could experience it.”
Just like her hand-decorated chocolates, the story of Petite Soeur — little sister, in French — is infused with Pearson’s personal touch. The name was inspired by the fact that her three brothers lovingly refer to her as “little sister,” even now that she is grown up. 
Pearson has family ties to Washington, D.C., which makes officially opening a chocolate shop in the area particularly exciting. 
“This is where my family planted themselves, and we were born here,” Pearson said. “It felt like a full-circle moment.”   
Pearson decided to open the first Petite Soeur storefront in Georgetown because the residents of the Georgetown neighborhood are supportive of new businesses, ideas and foods. Petite Soeur will hold its grand opening with giveaways, social media announcements, balloons and additional products, including chocolate bars, in mid-November, but customers can still visit the store in the meantime, according to Pearson.
One thing that needs to happen before the grand opening is choosing decor for the space, but ideally it will remain neutral so as not to distract from the hand-painted bonbons, according to Pearson.
“I love a very simple, clean palette, because the idea is truly to be that you are supposed to come in and your eye is supposed to be immediately drawn to the bonbons, which should be the only colored thing in the space,” Pearson said. 
As Petite Soeur opens, capacity restrictions will be in place both in terms of COVID-19 precautions and so each customer receives a one-on-one experience with the staff, according to Pearson. 
“Our shop is very small already, so right now we are keeping it to four customers in the shop at one time,” Pearson said. “That gives us the space we need and the guests the space they need.” 
Currently, Pearson is the only chocolatier at Petite Soeur, producing 900 to 1,200 bonbons per day, but she is hopeful that as the business grows, she will be able to hire and train the next generation of chocolatiers.
“My goal is to bring on some more people in the kitchen,” Pearson said. “That’s the whole point of the business is to have other young people learn how to do it so that the tradition lives on with chocolate making in general.”

The McDonough School of Business launched an initiative Oct. 20 focused on the expansion of  artificial intelligence and digital technologies in the workforce.
The initiative, titled “AI, Analytics, and the Future of Work,” will work to promote research, host speakers and develop educational programs which specifically focus on the impacts of technological advancements on economic and social development in the workforce. The initiative will be led by Alberto Rossi, the provost’s distinguished professor of finance, who will determine the vision of the initiative along with an advisory group.
Rapid technological advances have prompted global businesses and universities to re-examine the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and technological development in business, according to Rossi.
“The next generation of business leaders recognizes that traditional solutions no longer apply and that technology is transforming the workplace and changing the skills needed to succeed,” Rossi wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Leading research universities and business schools play an essential role in understanding the impact of these technological changes and equipping business leaders with the knowledge to make informed and principled decisions in this increasingly dynamic workplace environment.”
The MSB is looking forward to building its curricular and research capabilities surrounding topics about technology, according to Paul Almeida, dean of the MSB.
“At Georgetown McDonough, we are focused on preparing our students to excel in emerging fields and lead organizations through the tremendous changes that technological advances are bringing about,” Almeida wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our new AI, Analytics, and the Future of Work Initiative is focused on exploring how artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, and more are transforming how we work and what we do. ”
Within the program’s mission, the initiative will specifically study and develop artificial intelligence algorithms to help with decision-making, assess the role of technology in the workplace and explore how technology can promote inclusivity and equity in society, according to the Oct. 21 announcement of the initiative. 
The three focus areas will allow initiative members to study various topics of interest, according to Monica Gamez-Djokic, visiting assistant professor at the MSB and member of the initiative.
“As a psychologist by training, in my own research I am interested in how people perceive new technology in the workplace and the consequences of these perceptions for their behavior,” Gamez-Djokic wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m particularly interested in the implications of perceiving automation as a threat to jobs for political attitudes, social relations, and the type of skills people want to develop to remain competitive.”
The Future of Work Initiative will also collaborate with the MSB’s Business of Sustainability Initiative and MSB faculty-led research centers and institutes, as well as degree programs within the school, to explore complex issues through a business lens.
The combination of initiatives offered by the MSB will help prepare students for modern challenges, according to Almeida.
“By building our capabilities around the future of work in an interdisciplinary way, faculty who teach across all of our programs — from the undergraduates to master’s students to our Custom Executive Education offerings, and even alumni lifelong learning opportunities — will bring this perspective and knowledge to all McDonough students,” Almeida wrote in the Oct. 21 press release. “Graduates of our school will be equipped to meet the business challenges posed by AI and new technologies and advance their organizations in a way that values the people behind them.”
While the Future of Work initiative was only launched Oct. 20, the program plans to begin offering events and other opportunities for students in the near future, according to Rossi.
“As we ramp up, we expect to have a stable series of events for students, alumni and policy makers and have a stable set of fellows (students, faculty and external researchers) that contribute to the community through their work and research,” Rossi wrote.
According to Rossi, the initiative’s research will help expand the study of artificial intelligence and technological developments in the business world.
“We envision a world in which technological advances serve people and actively study how new technologies can be deployed to help individuals improve their everyday life and make them more productive members of society,” Rossi wrote.

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate approved a student referendum Oct. 17 to abolish the GUSA Senate and Executive and replace the bodies with a student activist assembly.
The referendum, which the senate approved with a vote of 14 in favor and three opposed, will allow the student body to vote during the upcoming Nov. 4 to 6 GUSA elections on whether to restructure the organization by abolishing the GUSA Senate, presidency and vice presidency. 
If passed by the student body, the referendum would implement a proposal put forward by GUSA’s new restructuring committee. Under the plan, current organizational hierarchies would be eliminated and replaced by various policy committees that would oversee advocacy efforts, according to GUSA Restructuring Committee Co-Chair Dakyung Ham (COL ’22).
The changes to GUSA’s structure will break down bureaucratic barriers and allow GUSA to better advocate for students, according to GUSA Senator Bora Balçay (SFS ’23), who was one of two senators to introduce the referendum. 
“GUSA will no longer be structured like a national government. It will be a student government first and foremost,” Balçay said in an interview with The Hoya. “People that you elect will not be voting on legislation that doesn’t go anywhere. They will be doing the job you elect them for.”
Currently, GUSA is composed of three branches: the GUSA Executive, which consists of the president and vice president and oversees executive advocacy efforts; the GUSA Senate, which represents each class and passes resolutions; and the Constitutional Council, which determines if GUSA actions adhere to the organization’s constitution and bylaws.
Because the referendum is an amendment to the GUSA Constitution, to implement the proposed changes, at least two-thirds of voters must support the change with at least a 25% voter turnout among the student body. Low voter turnout has thwarted previous efforts to restructure GUSA.
Student involvement in the restructuring process is a key priority for GUSA, according to GUSA Senate Speaker Leo Rassieur (COL ’22). 
“Members of the Senate are working tirelessly to promote the referendum and make sure that the student body is informed on how to vote, regardless of whether they vote in favor of or against a restructured GUSA,” Rassieur said in an email to The Hoya. “We will be holding a town hall, flyering, and doing anything else we can to get the word out and get folks talking about the referendum in anticipation of the election.”
However, some senators and students have raised objections to the referendum because of confusion over simultaneous GUSA Senate elections for the Class of 2025. The ballot for the November elections will simultaneously include elections for new senators in addition to the referendum vote.
As part of his objections to the restructuring referendum, GUSA Senator Zev Burton (SFS ’22) introduced an alternative proposal at the Oct. 17 meeting; however, the move was not brought forward for a vote.
First-year students have not been able to effectively voice their opinions about the referendum because they do not have any representatives in GUSA yet, according to Burton.
“The freshmen are the ones that are going to be impacted the most by this because they will be here another three years. Yet, they are not in the senate. They weren’t able to approve the referendum,” Burton said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s not like they will never be in the senate — we’ll have representatives in about two weeks when they would be able to speak their minds. It’s just shocking to me that people are willing to exclude 25% of the student body.”
GUSA should have held a restructuring referendum after first-year students had voted for senators in the Nov. 6 elections, according to Joe Massaua (SFS ’25), who opposes the referendum and was present at the Oct. 17 meeting. 
“For students to be voting at the same time for new senators and also voting to essentially abolish the senate or transition it to a new organization is wrong,” Massaua said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “What would have been better was to have it as a separate question, and what they’re doing is gaming the election to reach the vote threshold.”
GUSA will still pursue the restructuring plan despite these concerns, however, to ensure that students see immediate changes to the organization, according to GUSA Vice President Nicole Sanchez (SFS ’22). 
“In waiting, there’s always going to be a class who is not part of the discussion. There’s always going to be a group that’s going to be left out, and the truth is that we cannot keep pushing this back in the hopes that maybe next year everyone’s going to feel included,” Sanchez said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Those who actively want to be a part of the restructuring process have the opportunity to.”
Despite student concerns, the referendum’s sponsors remain optimistic it will be successful, according to Balçay.“I think it will be an overwhelming majority,” Balçay said. “These are very common-sense changes and things that students have been asking for years.”

After 19 long months, The Tombs once again welcomed students, graduates and families to dine in or share a drink at the iconic establishment.
The Tombs, a student-favorite restaurant and bar located on 36th Street, one block away from the front gates of Georgetown University’s main campus, reopened Oct. 21 after closing in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The formal reopening has been highly anticipated among members of the Georgetown community, who frequent The Tombs for a variety of celebrations and traditions. Unable to stay open during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many of their customers and employees are students, the establishment originally planned to reopen in late August when students returned to the Hilltop. 
Since reopening, The Tombs has been full of Georgetown students, which makes for a fun environment, according to Melina Asteriadis (COL ’22), who went to The Tombs on Oct. 27 for her 21st birthday. 
“It was pretty exciting,” Asteriadis said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It was cool that it was all Georgetown people, and it was definitely very much of a relief to finally be able to go.”
The establishment’s temporary closure meant that many students missed out on popular traditions like a “Tombs Night,” a 21st birthday celebration where one receives a stamp on their forehead at The Tombs’ bar to mark becoming legal. In past years, The Tombs has also hosted the 99 Days Club, which challenges participants to make a purchase at The Tombs for 99 straight days, for which their reward is the immortalization of their name on the restaurant’s wall. 
Asteriadis said she was excited to finally have her own “Tombs Night” celebration. 
“Since freshman year, everyone hears about the day that you turn 21 you get to go and get your forehead stamped,” Asteriadis said. “That was definitely very exciting and kind of just felt like some semblance of having the normal college experience.”   
However, a lack of hired staff pushed the opening back to later in the semester. Prior to the official reopening, The Tombs hosted a pre-opening pop-up event Oct. 15 and 16, in which they welcomed guests on a first come, first served basis. The pop-up event was a slightly scaled-back version of what The Tombs looked like during the official reopening, according to Josh Markowitz, manager of Clyde’s Restaurant Group, which oversees The Tombs.
Stacie Hartman (SFS ’21), who was not able to celebrate many of her friends’ Tombs Nights as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, returned to The Tombs for the pop-up event to reunite with friends from college and get her forehead stamped.
“Going back now was a bit different because I didn’t have my whole class there but it was still just as fun especially because a lot of class of 2020 and 2021 alumni were back on the opening night,” Hartman wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Since the pop-up event coincided with Georgetown Family Weekend, parents and alumni, like Liz Moyer (SFS ’89), were back on campus and had the opportunity to relive their time at Georgetown and The Tombs (Full disclosure: Moyer previously served as editor in chief of The Hoya).
“It was exactly the same room, they haven’t changed the decor at all, and it still smells like beer,” Moyer said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It was wonderful, and it’s just fun to be there again especially after what’s been going on the last couple of years.”
The Tombs has always been an important part of the Georgetown community. Its close proximity to campus has made it a convenient gathering place for students over the years, according to Moyer, who went to The Tombs frequently while studying at Georgetown.
“That was our go to place because it’s right there, and we were kind of lazy,” Moyer said. “The Tombs was where you went if you wanted to eat actual food.”
Beyond its role as a popular restaurant and bar for the Georgetown community, The Tombs also offers students opportunities for employment. Georgetown students make up the majority of both customers and employees.
According to Markowitz, as The Tombs reopens, it will once again reassume its position as a staple hangout spot for the Georgetown neighborhood. 
“It was designed to be part of the Georgetown community,” Markowitz said. “Ideally, people are either at school, in their dorms, or at The Tombs.”

HI – So glad you are back open…is the “gift shop” open.  We love our Tombs beer mugs.  Use them all the time …they were from the late 90″s 2000.  We also lover our white baseball cap with The Tombs embroidered on the front with an oar underneath.   Any chance you still sell these.  I lost mine sailing and the crew captain would not circle back to get it…to far out to dive in and save it.
Please please please…I would purchase 3 if you have them.  I am not local anymore.

Georgetown University will hold a commencement ceremony for the Class of 2020 after its original graduation was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) announced the ceremony Oct. 26 and asked for student input on the best events to celebrate undergraduate, graduate and law students who graduated in the spring of 2020. The university will host the ceremonies May 28 and 29, 2022. 
For some students, the commencement will serve as a reunion between classmates and professors they might not have seen for over two years, according to Maddie Charbonneau (COL ’20), who organized a petition calling on the university to host an in-person graduation. (Full disclosure: Charbonneau previously served as executive editor at The Hoya).
“After college all of my friends are kind of scattered,” Charbonneau said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Some are in D.C., I myself live in New York now, so it’ll be nice to see everybody in one place again and two years after the fact to acknowledge that this weird thing happened and we suddenly haven’t seen each other in two years.”
Others, however, are more focused on the opportunity for families to see their students formally graduate, especially if the students traveled far from home for college, according to Isabelle Smith (SFS ’20).
“It’s important to me as someone who went to college out of state. Most of my peers in high school and my family friends stayed within state for college, and so me going to Georgetown was a really big deal in my family,” Smith said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I’m looking forward to being able to celebrate that and for my family to kind of see how their sacrifices paid off.” 
The university canceled the traditional in-person commencement ceremony for the Class of 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In its place, Georgetown hosted a 30-minute Facebook livestream May 16, 2020, to celebrate graduating seniors. 
In order to improve the future ceremony’s accessibility for all students and their families, Georgetown should offer financial assistance for travel costs, according to Smith.
“I feel very lucky that I’m in D.C. for work and foresee myself being here in the near future next May, but I do think that there are probably going to be barriers for people being able to come,” Smith said. “I think it would be great if Georgetown offered some sort of financial assistance to students and families that qualified in order for them to also be able to attend commencement.” 
The university is excited to celebrate the Class of 2020 in commencement ceremonies next spring and is working to gather student input, according to a university spokesperson.
“When we were not able to hold a full commencement ceremony in May 2020, the University committed to hosting a commencement for the Class of 2020 when public health conditions would allow,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have met with Class of 2020 leadership on this topic and we are glad to be able to announce this wonderful news.”
In addition to offering financial help, the university should organize events that will be most meaningful to the Class of 2020 and their families, according to Catherine Tresslar (COL ’20).
“I’m happy they’re keeping their promise, but I don’t think people are going to want to come in from far out of town and invite their families if it’s just like a bar night, and if it’s something more lowkey I think the excitement will dwindle,” Tresslar said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I think people are really expecting them to do something a little more over-the-top since we did miss out on so much.”
In addition to a formal graduation ceremony, Tresslar hopes the university will reschedule the Senior Ball, an annual gala held during Senior Week to which students can bring their families. 
“Some of my friends and I all really want Senior Ball, and I think that one ranks so highly among seniors because it is really something inclusive,” Tresslar said. “Your friends and your family all get to come to that, it doesn’t require us putting on a cap and gown, it’s something in formal attire and makes it feel more grandiose and special like we are celebrating something.” 
While specific preferences for the celebrations may vary, two years after the graduates received their diplomas in the mail, commencement ceremonies are long overdue, according to Charbonneau.
“I’m personally excited that they’re asking us what we want out of it, so hopefully we as a class can build the commencement we want,” Charbonneau said.

Howard University students have been occupying a student center on campus for over two weeks, demanding university action regarding unsafe on-campus living conditions.
Since Oct. 12, students have been occupying the inside and outside of a student center on campus, calling on the university to address safety concerns after reports of poor ventilation, mold, leaking pipes, pests and mushrooms growing from ceilings in university residence halls. Student activists are calling for an in-person town hall with Howard President Wayne A. I. Frederick and other university administrators before the end of October, as well as legal and disciplinary immunity for all participants of the occupation. 
On Oct. 13, administrators asked students to stop occupying the Armour J. Blackburn University Center, warning they may face disciplinary consequences, including expulsion, according to an email sent to Howard students by Interim Student Affairs Vice President Cynthia Evers. In an Oct. 26 email to Howard students, Frederick again demanded the occupation come to an end. However, these threats have not deterred activists, who as of Oct. 28 continue to occupy the building. 
All students deserve to protest against housing injustice without facing repercussions, according to a group titled the Blackburn Takeover Family.
“We are not criminals. We are students who have been let down. We are the victims in this story,” the Blackburn Takeover Family wrote in a letter to the editor published by The Hilltop, Howard University’s student-operated newspaper. 
Howard students involved in the Live Movement, a coalition of current and former students fighting for the advancement of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Black students, organized the Blackburn protest. Since the start of the takeover, the organization has used social media to raise money for donations to buy supplies.
Clodomir Jean-Louis, a Howard University School of Law student and member of the Blackburn Takeover Advisory Council, said the safety concerns justify student outrage.
“I would challenge that the university has failed their job as steward of these particular students that are protesting and potentially all students on campus,” Jean-Louis said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
Howard University did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment. 
Now, Georgetown University students are standing in solidarity with Howard activists by delivering supplies to those occupying Blackburn. The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) and the Georgetown Black Student Alliance (BSA) traveled to Howard on Oct. 14 to distribute materials like hygiene products, clothing, pillows and prepackaged food, according to GUSA President and BSA President Nile Blass (COL ’22). 
“People were speaking about their personal experiences and how the indifference and oftentimes misaction of the Howard University administration has harmed them,” Blass said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
Blass said uplifting the voices of Howard students and the Live Movement is essential.
“We don’t actually need to speak for the Howard University students — they’ve organized, they’ve made it very clear what is unacceptable of the situation, and specific ways in which they seek restitution,” Blass said. “So amplifying the voices of Black and Brown students at Howard has been a big part.” 
In addition to disciplinary threats by university officials, police officers in the Howard Department of Public Safety have also used force against those occupying the building; an Oct. 23 Instagram live video shows a Howard police officer pushing students gathered in front of the Blackburn building, as well as threatening to use their baton.
Activists have also demanded that student, graduate and faculty voting power be reinstated to the Howard board of trustees. In June, the university announced it would phase out student, graduate and faculty influence in board decisions after it completed a review, consulting an outside firm and interviewing over 40 campus community members. 
Jean-Louis said the removal of student, graduate and faculty voting power from the board of trustees sends the message that Howard does not trust them. 
“When you remove student representation from the governing body of the university, when you remove alumni and faculty representation, they’re essentially saying we don’t want to be transparent anymore,” Jean-Louis said. 
According to Aaron Booe, sophomore at Howard and the founder and chairperson of the Claudia Jones Club, a student-run club that aims to advance political education grounded in the struggles of oppressed people with a vision of liberation, the board of trustees limits the university’s response to student demands. 
“Universities are private institutions, so naturally they’re going to be beholden to the board of trustees who run their universities,” Booe said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The issues that students occupying Blackburn are fighting against are part of a long history of administrative failings, according to Jean-Louis. 
“This university has a lot of good things about it, a lot, and I would say they’re mostly because of the students and the faculty,” Jean-Louis said. “When it comes to the administration, and the university processes, the operation, there are some core issues there that have never been thoroughly resolved.”

Wonderful article Caitlin!!! Very important to continue uplifting the voices of the Blackburn Takeover Family. As of 10/29 they are still occupying the building and calling for donations of sealed hot and cold food/meals. Show solidarity by dropping off food or sending funds to $TheLiveMovement on CashApp and @TheLiveMovement on Venmo!

Upperclassmen living on campus can now apply for financial assistance for mandatory meal plans following activism efforts by student leaders and activists.
Juniors and seniors can now apply for meal plan financial assistance, which will be awarded on a case-by-case basis according to students’ financial need, according to an Oct. 21 email from university officials. Administrators will contact students regarding award decisions, which will be announced on a biweekly basis beginning the week of Nov. 8, according to the email. 
In June, the university announced that, for the 2021-22 academic year, all students living on campus must purchase a meal plan. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the university did not require juniors and seniors living on campus to purchase a meal plan. The plan outraged students, prompting the Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) to take action. 
Owen O’Brien Powers (COL ’22), a senior who lives on campus and is therefore required to purchase the meal plan, said the university’s decision to provide financial aid gives students greater agency.
“Whether students choose to apply for the aid or not, it reduces an experience many students have articulated if being forced to spend money the simply do not have,” O’Brien Powers wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Students activists have been demanding reform surrounding campus dining options since this summer. For instance, in August, the GUSA Senate unanimously passed a resolution demanding cheaper meal plan options for all students living on campus, including the provision that juniors and seniors be exempt from purchasing a meal plan with a refund of their meal plan charges. 
The university will award aid in accordance with students’ expected family contribution, and decisions will not impact students’ current or future financial aid packages, according to the email.
GUSA worked with the university to write the policy, according to GUSA Senate Speaker Leo Rassieur (COL ’22). 
“GUSA played a very integral role compared to previous policies rolled out by the administration,” Rassieur said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “This time they actively asked us to help draft the language and give a sense of what students would be looking for and so because of our feedback.” 
Originally the university was not willing to change its meal plan policy midway through the semester, according to Rassieur. 
“From the beginning we were advocating for a repeal of the current meal plan requirement to return it to what it looked like in previous years,” Rassieur said. “The administration was very constrained on that and said that they really had no intention to change the meal plan requirement in the middle of the semester.” 
GUSA initially reached out to the administration regarding meal plans last month over concerns about safety in Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall, the only dining hall on campus, after more than 140 campus community members exhibited symptoms consistent with norovirus, according to GUSA Senate Vice Speaker Rowlie Flores (SFS ’22). 
“What first started as a public health meeting immediately became subsequent meetings on the meal plan as we advocated for exemptions to be made for juniors and seniors, a policy the university had implemented prior to the pandemic,” Flores wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Due to the urgency of the matter, we met practically every week.” 
Flores said GUSA plans to hold conversations with the administration about meal plan policies for the spring semester. While the financial assistance program for meal plans is a start, Flores said meal plans still contribute to food insecurity. 
“This financial assistance program is a great start but regardless of a student’s financial status, it is important to consider their urgency to make their own choices in regards to their living situation,” Flores wrote. “Requiring students to be on a meal plan limits their options by a lot and is a reason why food insecurity occurs.”

CW: This article references gun violence. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
The Georgetown University Law Center Civil Rights Clinic filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), arguing that Facebook and Instagram failed to remove violent content from their platforms.
The clinic joined gun safety advocate Andy Parker on Oct. 12 in filing a complaint with the FTC. The complaint came after Parker alleged Facebook violated its terms of service after the company failed to remove videos of the murder of Parker’s daughter, Alison Parker. Under the social media company’s terms of service, users cannot post content that shows “harmful conduct towards others.”
Alison Parker, a television reporter in Roanoke, Va., was shot and killed in August 2015 alongside her cameraman Adam Ward while reporting live. Following the shooting, videos of Parker’s and Ward’s deaths appeared on various social media platforms, including Facebook, which showed footage from Ward’s camera and the shooter’s GoPro.
Facebook prioritizes profit over the removal of violent content from their platform, according to Parker.
“They could take this stuff down, but they don’t want to because they monetize it,” Parker said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “They profit from Alison’s murder, from violent content like that, and disinformation, and you know the list goes on, every day there’s another revelation. We just have to continue to shine a light on this.” 
The clinic which is composed of eight students and works with clients facing discrimination or constitutional rights infringement, is representing Parker in the complaint. In February 2020, the clinic represented him in a similar complaint against YouTube and Google.
After receiving the complaint, the FTC can choose to perform an investigation into Facebook, which could lead to legal settlements, lawsuits, fines or other enforcement actions, depending on the findings of the initial investigation, according to the FTC’s website. 
Facebook violated a contract with users by not removing reported content that violates its terms, according to Abby Rickeman (LAW ’22), one of the students working with the clinic on the complaint.
“If Facebook is saying that they’re going to remove content that is harmful, especially when family members or relatives report the videos of their relatives being harmed, and they’re not doing that, I think that results in a deceptive trade practice,” Rickeman said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It’s a breach of the agreement between users and Facebook.”
The complaint specifically calls on the FTC to investigate and bring an enforcement action against Facebook for violating their terms of service, a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits “deceptive acts,” according to a copy of the complaint obtained by The Hoya. 
“Mr. Parker and families who have experienced similar tragedies do not deserve to endure the pain of knowing others are deriving pleasure from the deaths of their loved ones. FTC action to prevent continued harmful consumer deception is both appropriate and necessary,” the complaint reads.
Facebook has been working to remove these videos from its platform and is continuing to remove similar content as it is posted, according to a Facebook company spokesperson.
“These videos violate our policies and we are continuing to remove them from the platform as we have been doing since this disturbing incident first occurred,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are also continuing to proactively detect and remove visually similar videos when they are uploaded.”
Now that the complaint has been filed, Parker and the clinic are awaiting a response from the FTC on whether the agency will pursue an investigation into the complaint; however, the FTC is not required to respond by a specific date.
It is time for Facebook and other social media sites to take responsibility for their content and regulate it correctly and truthfully to consumers, according to Parker. 
“It’s time to grow a conscience and do something for this country,” Parker said. “For all the good that YouTube and Google and Facebook do, there’s a lot of just really bad stuff that they’re letting go, and they monetize it, they profit off of it. They’ll deny it, but we know better.”
