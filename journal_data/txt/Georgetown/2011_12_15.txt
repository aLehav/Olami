A graduate student was robbed at gunpoint in the northern section of Glover Park at 8:20 p.m. Wednesday night.
According to a DPS public safety alert emailed to the campus community Thursday afternoon, the student came in to the Department of Public Safety headquarters around 11:30 a.m. Thursday to report that he had been robbed while walking on 41st Street between Calvert and Davis Streets.
The PSA reported that two black males, one carrying a handgun, exited a black sedan and accosted the student. They shoved him to the ground and took a bag containing books and a laptop computer, along with the student’s wallet and cell phone.
The student was then ordered to walk away and the suspects fled in an unknown direction with his property.
After walking home, the student immediately called the Metropolitan Police Department. MPD is now handling the investigation.
Representatives from DPS could not be reached for comment at press time.

More than $1,500 in cigarettes was stolen from Vital Vittles Dec. 6, according to a Metropolitan Police Department preliminary incident report.
The theft was reported to MPD by The Corp’s Chief Executive Officer, Alexander Pon (COL ’12).  According to Pon’s description of the incident to MPD, the suspect went into a storage area at 3:49 p.m. and stole the cigarettes. It is unclear from the MPD report exactly how many cartons were stolen.
The report describes the suspect as a Latino male, about 35 to 40 years old and of heavy build. He is also described as having short black hair and a mustache and a light complexion,  was wearing a black coat, a black shirt and blue pants.
MPD responded to the report of the incident and canvassed the area for the suspect, but was unable to find him.
This is the second time that cigarettes have been stolen from a Vital Vittles storeroom. On Sept. 4, two employees discovered while they were restocking inventory that 90 cartons had been stolen from the store.
At the time, The Corp’s Chief Operating Officer Brooke Heinichen (SFS ’12) said that the student-run business was working to strengthen its security in the wake of the incident.
“This is an opportunity to increase our security measures, and that’s something we’re doing across our services, despite the fact that it just occurred at Vittles,” she told The Hoya.
These measures included the installation of security cameras at Vital Vittles.
Since then, Vital Vittles has reported one other incident, which involved a suspect stealing $200 in unattended cash from the convenience store’s back room. No other Corp location has reported a theft to the Department of Public Safety or MPD since the beginning of the semester.
Pon and Heinichen declined to comment on the most recent theft.
Correction: In an earlier version of this article, it was incorrectly stated that security cameras have been installed at all Corp services. This corrected version was posted at 12:10 p.m. Thursday.
