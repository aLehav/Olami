Five expert attorneys involved in the impeachment of President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) went head-to-head in a debate Friday at Georgetown Law Center.
Panelists included Monica Lewinsky’s co-counsel Plato Cacheris (LAW ’65); special counsel to President Clinton Gregory Craig; author of “The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr” Ken Gormley and other participants in the high-profile investigation.
The event concentrated on the scandal surrounding Clinton’s impeachment for perjury regarding his interactions with then-22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Panelists also discussed the conduct of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who became a controversial figure for his alleged political agenda in the prosecution process.
Craig, former White House counsel to President Clinton, said that he thought the scandal was blown out of proportion by Republicans determined to oust the commander in chief from office.
“It was the U.S. Senate that saved America from a grotesque miscarriage of justice,” Craig said, referring to the fact that the Senate did not vote Clinton out of office.
Gilbert Davis, an attorney for the prosecution, said that he did not believe the impeachment was based on political bias.
“The idea that this was a right wing coup is just specious,” he said. “Isn’t the fact truly that the president lied?”
Gormley and other members of the panel expressed more centered sentiments, claiming that the matter was complicated by shades of purple rather than Democratic blue or Republican red.
“I do think this episode shows that the country’s not at its best when we’re at each others’ throats,” Gormley said in his concluding remarks. “This [scandal] marked the popularization of this angry divide we see in this country today.”
The panelists were also split over Starr’s conduct.
“People who think that Ken Starr was an irresponsible prosecutor who politicized the investigation … say if a professional prosecutor like Bob Fiske was in there this never would have been pursued,” said John Harris, editor-in-chief of Politico and moderator of the panel.
Most of the panelists, while they did not necessarily agree with Starr’s decisions, said that they respected him as an attorney.
Former Deputy Independent Counsel Solomon Wisenberg said that the advice of senior prosecutors influenced Starr’s actions.
“What was important to him was, and what he said repeatedly and what he followed, once he had career prosecutors in some leadership positions was, ‘I want to be a microcosm of the Department of Justice, and I want to rely upon the advice of senior prosecutors who have been around.'”
Erica Trachtman (LAW ’13) said that she thought the panelists’ comments touched upon the important interaction of politics and the law in issues like impeachment.
“It was really fascinating to have all of these people in one room and see them interact,” she said. “The effect the whole scandal had on Constitutional law was certainly profound.”

A student arrived to his off-campus residence on Monday morning to find the home burglarized and his laptop stolen.
According to a Public Safety Alert issued by the Department of Public Safety, the student reported to DPS that he had departed from his residence — which is located on the 1300 block of 35th Street — on Sunday morning, leaving the back door unlocked. He arrived home at 11:33 a.m. Monday to find that the residence had been burglarized.
No suspects were reported in the incident.
“It apparently was an unforced burglary, and to our knowledge the only thing missing is the laptop,” Associate Director of DPS Joseph Smith said.
Smith emphasized that this is only the latest in a year-long string of thefts and burglaries targeting laptops specifically , and he urged the campus community to read DPS’s safety reminders regarding best practices for avoiding thefts.
“I do think we have some thieves out there that are targeting laptops in particular. If you look at over the past year the Mac laptops have been of particular interest to thieves,” Smith said. “Public Safety Alerts always include information about the best practices and security and I would encourage our community to read those and take them to heart,” he added.
The Metropolitan Police Department and detectives were notified, and the case has been forwarded to MPD detectives for further investigation.

The Student Activities Commission passed an amendment to its funding guidelines Monday night allowing student groups to formally appeal programming arcs, sanctions and event approvals through the Center for Student Programs.
Previously, student groups could only appeal SAC decisions through the commission itself.
For event appeals and sanctions, students groups will submit their initial appeal to SAC, which will then submit the appeal to the CSP. Two CSP representatives will make the formal decision on the issue and return the ruling to the group within ten business days.
For programming arcs ─ the schedule of events each student organization must submit before the beginning of a semester ─ the appeals made will be first reconsidered by SAC, and only if necessary will be adjudicated by CSP.
SAC Commissioner Amanda Lanzillo (SFS ’13) presented the amendment.
“Some of what came out when we met with groups, is that maybe things should not just be coming straight back to SAC, especially in instances in which we’ve already made up our minds on things,” she said.
“This is just a small step towards making SAC more transparent and open,” SAC Vice-Chairperson Ruiyong Chen (SFS ’13) added.
SAC also dealt with three more amendments that arose from the recommendations of working groups set up by the commission two weeks ago.
One of these amendments would clarify the Access to Benefits Review process.
“Group leaders complained about the vagueness of our sanctions process, so we thought it would be a great way to clarify it,” Chen said.
This section would specify the reasons that groups could be placed under review and how the process itself functions. The amendment was brought to a vote but did not pass.
In another addendum, SAC would allow groups to change the scale of their programming arc during the course of a semester if necessary. This could include reducing, modifying or increasing the number of events in the arc.
The programming arc amendment was not brought to vote. The authors were instructed to clarify the language of the proposal before presenting it again.
A possible contingency fund through which SAC could allocate groups additional money was the last of the amendments.
The contingency fund would allow SAC to retain a small percentage of allocation funds every semester as a contingency fund in order to support “unexpected and innovative programming needs.”
However, some commissioners, including Carlos DeLaTorre (COL’13), took issues with the vagueness of this clause.
“I think it should be laid out specifically. What does creative programming mean?” he asked.
The amendment was not voted upon. According to Chen, it is unlikely that it will be considered again. The remaining amendments may be brought to vote after Easter break.

After passing the now-infamous Disorderly Conduct Amendment Act in January, the D.C. Council proved that it had failed its student constituents by imposing noise laws that blatantly target the young adult demographic. Yet the upcoming April 26 election for an at-large member provides the golden opportunity for the council to save face if students cast the vote for Sekou Biddle.
Of all the candidates, Biddle has the most experience in town-gown relations and boasts the most active participation in social justice efforts around the District. The recent candidate forum sponsored by D.C. Students Speak highlighted Biddle’s understanding of students’ niche role as District residents. Rather than pander to student interests, Biddle was one of the few candidates whose platform revolved around engaging students as active citizens, not merely as voters.
Unlike other contenders, Biddle was one of the few at the forum who discussed the need for a balance between community and campus. The noise ordinance and the blatant gerrymandering of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission discriminates against students, granting the neighbors of the university undue privilege and fomenting voter apathy.
Biddle supports more reasonable ANC redistricting in the near future and stated his support for a respectful dialogue regarding town-gown tension. He stresses that it is unnecessary to use handcuffs and paddy wagons to deal with student behavior; as he advocates, the community and students must work on living respectfully side by side.
While not directly endorsing the campus plan, Biddle has avoided turning a zoning controversy into a game of political football. While council members Mary Cheh and Jack Evans have shamefully denounced the university’s 2010-2020 Campus Plan, students should rest assured that Biddle takes a more balanced approach to the issue of university expansion. Biddle called upon the zoning commission to help mediate the situation, without letting any one interest have a greater advantage than the other.
As the executive director of Jumpstart for Young Children, Biddle shares a common commitment with students for real social justice that creates tangible results. Biddle has time and time again reiterated his support for reformers like former D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee, who shares a sense of urgency to address real problems in real time. Moreover, Biddle advocates for an effective government that works to balance the needs of a wide variety of citizens. Reducing red tape within city agencies, distributing budgetary burden and making tangible improvements to D.C. Public Schools are all at the core of his position.
For Biddle, students’ willingness to serve is unsurpassed in comparison to other demographics in the District. Through mentorship and active outreach as members of the greater D.C. area, students play a large role in making D.C. a more livable city for all. As such, Biddle’s position on the D.C. Council will ensure that students have the rights to permit a mutually beneficial town-gown relationship.
Biddle understands the current reality of the District and is one of the only true reformers to boast prior experience through his efforts with the Jumpstart program. Students must take time next Thursday to ensure that the D.C. Council has a member that best represents needs of a student population.
