The School of Foreign Service celebrated its centennial with a gala weekend over Nov. 15 to 17, hosting panels with notable guest speakers, career-planning workshops and a formal ball at the National Building Museum. 
The weekend’s festivities included the “Centennial Gala Dinner,” a formal ball held Saturday at the National Building Museum with 1,200 guests, including well-known alumni such as former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) and King Felipe VI (GRD ’95) of Spain. The ball also featured a performance by renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma.
Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright were also featured on separate panels about global affairs and foreign policy at this weekend’s centennial events. In addition, Academy Award-nominated actor David Strathairn performed a solo play about the life of Jan Karski (GRD ’52, H ’83), a Polish World War II hero, longtime SFS professor and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient.
The weekend was a central event in a series of celebrations throughout the academic year to commemorate 100 years since the founding the SFS, which was established in 1919 by Fr. Edmund Walsh, S.J., a Jesuit priest and Georgetown University geopolitics professor. 
The centennial budget for events over the course of the year totaled $1.8 million, according to Will Layman (LAW ’87), executive director for the centennial. Layman was hired in 2015 to assist with planning the gala, as well as other celebrations throughout the year aimed at celebrating the history of the school, he said in an interview with The Hoya.
The centennial events aim to both commemorate the school’s history and encapsulate how the SFS exemplifies Georgetown’s Jesuit values, according to Layman.
“We want the centennial to be about more than just a fancy black tie gala, which was really great and really cool, but it’s got to give out more than that,” Layman said. “We want it to touch students; we want it to touch alumni.”
The attendance of many SFS alumni, including ambassadors and state officials, contributed to making the gala a memorable experience, according to Divjot Bawa (SFS ’23).
“What the centennial means to me really again goes to highlight and show the incredible opportunities, connections and influence the SFS has had not just in the Georgetown community, but really in the world impacting government, nonprofit and corporate organizations, and institutions,” Bawa said.
Through workshops over the weekend, Georgetown alumni shared their career stories with students and other attendees, speaking on their leadership experiences in various fields and industries. As part of the programming, the SFS also hosted informational interviews to connect students and alumni.
Centennial programming organizers published a book, “SFS 100: A Century of Service,” documenting the history of the achievements of SFS alumni and professors, according to Layman. The school also installed an exhibit in Lauinger Library, “The House That Walsh Built: A Century of Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service,” showcasing historical items related to the school, such as graduation bulletins, photographs and school announcements, to draw attention to the anniversary.
The weekend was a highlight of the yearlong celebration of the SFS’ centennial festivities, according to Layman. 
“It’s not just one weekend; it’s not just one party, but it’s really a whole year of substantive engagement,” Layman said. “And the bigger thing was that Dean Hellman felt that the SFS needed to do a lot of planning not just to plan an event or series of events, but to start learning how to tell the story of the school and to do it over some time.” 
In addition to the gala, the SFS has and will continue hosting events throughout the rest of the academic year. The school held an informal “SFS Birthday Bash” in the Healey Family Student Center on Sept. 20 and will also be co-sponsoring both a men’s basketball game in February and the annual Global Expo held by the Georgetown International Student Association in the spring. Additional centennial celebrations for alumni farther from the Hilltop will take place in New York, San Francisco and London over the next few months, according to Layman. 
The centennial is an opportunity to gather students and alumni together and remind them of the importance of the SFS’ mission, Hellman said. The recent political climate in particular has emphasized the importance of the SFS in encouraging students to enter the field of foreign affairs, according to Hellman.
“To some extent, the very idea of foreign policy professionalism is being undermined as we speak, as we’re watching it on television through the hearings and others,” Hellman said. “What an incredible opportunity to gather everyone together and remind ourselves of the importance of what we do here.”

Had I not graduated from SFS, I never would have become a poet! The degree gives you the confidence to do anything after graduation; and you’ll do it well! I’d like to share my poem To Those Who Came Before.  I am but a voice of one/ Speaking for the many/ Who came before/ Most of them have left this life/But they did not die/Their hopes, dreams and aspirations/Would come together in me/ And their banner became mine/ Where they could not stride/ My path would be ready and waiting/Their courage, patience and grace/ Would lead to my being in the race/ Where I would stride/ With head and shoulders held high/ Because in the scheme of things/ God knew/ I would not be denied. Thank you! Vincent Santiago SFS’81

Policymakers and gun reform activists emphasized the disproportionate effect of gun violence on marginalized communities at a Nov. 19 event.
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) gave opening remarks at the event, “Only in America: Examining the Everyday Toll of Gun Violence” in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room. The event was sponsored by the Georgetown University chapter of March For Our Lives, a national student-led anti-gun violence organization, the Georgetown University College Democrats, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Georgetown Institute for Politics and Public Service and the Georgetown University Lecture Fund. 
Four panelists examined why gun violence unduly affects certain racial groups more than others and proposed solutions to address gun violence in the United States. The panelists included Joseph Sakran, director of emergency general surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital; David Chipman, a former agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and Helisa Cruz, high school outreach director for MFOL D.C. 
Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) was scheduled to join the panel but was unable to attend and was replaced by Igor Volsky, the director of Guns Down America, a gun reform organization known for its strong opposition to the National Rifle Association.
Murphy recounted a personal experience about a school he visited in Sandtown, Baltimore — a primarily black community — that went into “code green” during his visit, meaning an active shooter was several blocks away. The experience helped Murphy understand the horrific psychological effects shootings have on children, he said.
“Every single kid at that school is faced with this reality that they might come to school that day and when they get home their parents won’t be there either,” Murphy said. “They fear for their lives when they walk to school, when they walk home, when they run out to the corner grocery on the weekend for their parents.”
Baltimore has one of the highest rates of gun violence in the country, with over 500 people shot in nonfatal incidents and more than 150 killed as of July 2019, according to the Baltimore Sun. 
Gun violence takes a high emotional toll on people’s lives, especially young people, who face the risk of dying young from gun violence in some communities, according to Cruz, a resident of northeast D.C. and a senior at BASIS D.C. Public Charter School. 
“There are so many of my friends that have friends that should be writing their college essays with me, that should be experiencing any of these college processes but they’re not because they’re dead,” Cruz said. 
Gun violence disproportionately affects marginalized groups, despite often only receiving widespread media attention when it affects white children, she said.
“It seems like the media only cares when white kids die and I’m like, that’s unfair, because I feel as though black and brown kids deserve to live,” Cruz said. “Just because of the opportunities we aren’t given in a system that suppresses, is it really that fair that we won’t be able to live?”
There are nearly 33,000 gun deaths in the United States annually, and nearly one-third of these are homicides, based on averages from 2012 to 2014. Black Americans are victims of gun violence at significantly higher rates than other racial groups, with a rate of 16.7 homicides per 100,000 people, compared to 1.5 homicides per 100,000 white Americans, according to Five Thirty Eight.
Sakran agreed that gun reform only occurred after gun violence impacted predominantly white communities.
“Frankly, it wasn’t until suburban white students started getting shot up that all of a sudden people started to care,” Sakran said.
Despite the ongoing epidemic of gun violence, campaigns to address gun violence are gaining large-scale support, Murphy said.
“The good news is this country is waking up,” Murphy said. “What we have become in a short six-year period of time is more powerful than the gun lobby. We have more money, we have more activists, we have more voters that care about our issues.”
Just four years ago, politicians were not having the same in-depth conversations about guns that they are having today, according to Volsky.
“For a long time, politicians from both sides of the aisle, but certainly from the left, felt that talking about guns was a big liability,” Volsky said. “But what’s happened since is that, really, a growing realization that young people like you care about this issue and that you will vote based on this issue.”
Educating the Georgetown community about the levels of gun violence in marginalized communities in D.C., as well as across the nation, is critical, according to James Benner (SFS ’21), a member of the Georgetown chapter of MFOL and one of the organizers of the event. 
“Unfortunately ,there are high rates of gun violence in other sections, particularly in communities across the river that I think goes unnoticed by the Georgetown students and the Georgetown community,” Benner said. “The main purpose of this event was just to bring in some of those voices who have experiences and who live in those communities who are regularly affected by gun violence.”

A new student-designed women’s and gender studies class titled “Title IX for a New Generation” and aimed at encouraging students to address issues surrounding the Title IX system at Georgetown University will be offered for the first time in spring.
The course will explore the origin and impact of, as well as controversies around, Title IX, a law that protects students in education programs from discrimination on the basis of sex, according to the course catalog description. Sara Collina, attorney and women’s and gender studies adjunct lecturer, will work with students and peer mentors to complete project-based research and analyze how Title IX plays a role in students’ lives at Georgetown, according to Collina. 
Collaborating with students to develop the first student-designed class on Title IX at Georgetown has been an exciting process, Collina wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“The title says it all- this is the moment and this is the generation to finally make Title IX work for everyone,” Collina wrote. “Students will be applying their academic prowess to address one of the contentious- and important-gender issues of our time.” 
Collina began designing the course in spring 2019 after receiving an email from Provost Robert Groves calling on professors to propose experiential learning courses to add to Georgetown’s curriculum, she wrote. Collina then reached out to students potentially interested in learning more about Title IX to collaborate on the course.
After gauging interest from student collaborators, Collina received funding and approval for a fall 2019 three-credit interdisciplinary studies course titled “Interdisc Design Project.” The 11 students in the weekly fall course worked with Collina to design the upcoming spring class, “Title IX for a New Generation,” by developing learning objectives, assignments, lesson plans and assessments for the class, according to the course description. 
The assignments in the upcoming class are not only intended to educate students on the history and effect of Title IX, but also to encourage a broader, positive impact on Georgetown’s approach to issues of sexual violence, according to student course collaborator Olivia Horton (COL ’20),  who is enrolled in “Interdisc Design Project.”
“We won’t just be studying how universities could improve their cultures surrounding sexual harassment and assault, we will be designing resources and proposing improvements that will help Georgetown change our campus culture today,” Horton wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The class will be broken into four units: Orientation, Power & Privilege, Prevention, and Protection & Due Process, according to Casey Doherty (COL ’20), one of the students planning the course. Students will also be asked to write weekly reflections and research creative ways to approach Title IX issues.
The course will also collaborate with Health Education Services, the university’s Title IX staff and various student activist groups to educate students about the resources available to them at Georgetown, according to Lily Rubinstein (COL ’22), a student in “Interdisc Design Project.” 
Georgetown has had various vacancies in its Title IX office in the past 18 months. After former Title IX Coordinator Laura Cutway unexpectedly left the university in June 2018, Samantha Berner, then Title IX investigator, began serving in both roles concurrently. On July 1, Berner was named full-time Title IX coordinator and director of Title IX compliance, leaving the Title IX investigator role vacant. The university still has not hired a full-time investigator.
Berner has joined with Collina in other classes to discuss Title IX with students and said she is looking forward to continuing her collaboration with Collina in the upcoming class. 
“We are grateful for our community’s respectful and diverse engagement on these complex issues,” Berner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are excited to see the results of the Title IX For a New Generation class and will continue to work with our partners across campus on steps to prevent sexual assault and misconduct at Georgetown.”
In October, students in “Interdisc Design Project” attended a listening session about the results of the 2019 Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey hosted by the Title IX staff, according to Berner. The survey, released Oct. 15, revealed that only 44.0% of survey respondents believe it is likely or extremely likely that campus officials would conduct a fair investigation in response to a report of sexual assault or other misconduct. 
Doherty joined “Interdisc Design Project” to learn about ways to combat sexual violence and create equitable Title IX policy at Georgetown. The campus climate survey results demonstrated a need to improve the relationship between students and Georgetown’s Title IX Office, according to Doherty.
“Our campus climate survey shows that students don’t trust the Title IX Office or Georgetown in general to seek the best outcome for survivors,” Doherty wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This must change.”
“Title IX for a New Generation” will provide students with the tools to identify issues with the current implementation of the Title IX policy at Georgetown, according to Doherty. 
“This class will equip students to be able to engage in difficult discussions, identify and explain power dynamics, and pinpoint problems within our current national and campus Title IX procedures,” Doherty wrote. “This class is empowering and critically important, and I’m proud to play a small role in its formation.”

This is wonderful. Kudos to my colleague Sara Collina. I also want to remind the Georgetown community that for almost 15 years I taught the class Athletics and Gender as faculty for Georgetown’s Women’s and Gender Studies Program, and required every student to complete a final paper on Title IX law. Almost every Georgetown athlete took that class, which introduced Title IX sports issues through readings such as Sarah Field’s text Female Gladiators. My students’ insights and suggestions about strengthening Title IX were so powerful that I ended up quoting many Hoyas in my books and articles about the progression of women’s history. I am now teaching my sports class at Berkeley (with an enrollment of 200!), but have never forgotten my beautiful Georgetown students–or the experience of being an “honorary coach” at football, basketball and lacrosse games…Thanks to Women’s and Gender Studies for keeping the flame alight!

Students have signed a letter calling for the new MedStar Georgetown University Hospital surgical pavilion to be named after Eileen Niedfield (MED ’51), valedictorian of the first class of women accepted to the Georgetown University Medical Center. 
The Nov. 14 letter, signed by six student organizations and 18 students at the time of publication, argues that the surgical pavilion, which is currently under construction between Darnall Hall and the main MedStar buildings, should be named after Niedfield. A member of the Medical Mission Sisters religious order, she served as a surgeon in India for over 40 years. 
The letter comes after a corresponding resolution passed by the Georgetown University Student Association senate at its Nov. 3 meeting. The resolution was sponsored by senators Daniella Sanchez (COL ’22) and Joshua Marin-Mora (SFS ’21) and passed the senate with 24 votes in support and two abstentions. 
Marin-Mora, who also serves as the transportation and accessibility policy chair for the senate, decided to draft the resolution after reading an op-ed published in The Hoya by C.C. Borzilleri (COL ’19) in January 2019 calling for the new building to be named after Niedfield. 
“I thought it was a profoundly written article and that is when I turned to Daniella to talk to her to see if she’d be interested in the idea that C.C. had initially proposed,” Marin-Mora said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Borzilleri’s wrote the op-ed after she completed a project with the Georgetown Women’s Alliance to hang panels in the Hoya Court highlighting the stories of women graduates of Georgetown University.
While researching for the program, Borzilleri discovered Niedfield’s story, which she said was a particularly notable example of women’s contributions to Georgetown. 
“During the exhibit research process one of the hardest parts was selecting which of Georgetown’s women to highlight: there are just so many worthy of recognition,” Borzilleri wrote in an email to The Hoya. “One story which particularly struck me was Niedfield’s, and the construction of the Pavilion was in its earliest stages at this point, so I thought there might be a chance to get this idea out there early before the building could be named after someone else.”
Sanchez, who serves as the vice chair of the senate policy and advocacy committee and the gender equity policy chair, believes naming this new building after Niedfield would be a positive step toward better memorializing women on campus.
“Georgetown can improve on highlighting women of the church, they can improve on highlighting women’s narratives through events,” Sanchez said. “They can just provide a lot more attention to us presently and that would help institutionalized gender equality for the future.”
Georgetown traditionally names university buildings after historical figures, major donors or individuals who served within the university administration, according to Sanchez. Few campus buildings are named after individual women. 
In 2013, there was a similar campus-wide initiative focused on naming a building. A GUSA senator advocated for the newest residence hall to be named after Pedro Arrupe, S.J., the 28th superior general of the Society of Jesus. This initiative inspired her January 2019 op-ed, according to Borzelleri. 
Student organizations that have signed the letter at the time of publication include Hermanas de Georgetown, the Latin American Student Association, Georgetown Latinx Leadership Forum, the Patrick Healy Fellowship, the Central American United Student Association and Georgetown Disability Alliance. 
The Georgetown Disability Alliance cited the positive implications of the bill as reasoning for the group’s decision to sign the petition, according to GDS founder and board member Anna Landre (SFS ’21).
“GDA believes that the work of women has been marginalized in the history of Georgetown and, of course, in the world beyond,” Landre wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We need to work to correct this bias and that’s why we’re excited about the prospect of highlighting the work of a fantastic alumna through the name of the new Medstar building.”
This article has been updated to correct the spelling of C.C. Borzilleri’s name and include her school and graduation year at Georgetown. The headline was also updated to clarify the nature of the petition.

UHustle, an online marketplace developed by Georgetown University students to connect college students running side businesses with potential customers, won $30,000 at Georgetown’s annual entrepreneurship competition, Bark Tank, on Nov. 14.
The Bark Tank competition, which seeks to financially support business ventures created by Georgetown entrepreneurs, was supported by Ted Leonsis (CAS ’77), founder and CEO of Washington, D.C.-based production company Monumental Sports & Entertainment and hosted by Georgetown Entrepreneurship. Groups participated in the competition to win prizes from a total pool of $100,000. To reflect Georgetown’s Jesuit values, the prize supports Georgetown entrepreneurs that are addressing relevant global issues, according to the university website.
The Bark Tank competition allows students the opportunity to develop business ideas that have a positive global impact, according to Jeff Reid, founding director of Georgetown Entrepreneurship. Last year’s winner was Shavini Fernando (GRD ’18), whose venture O2Wear monitors oxygen levels for individuals living with heart defects.
“Our recent Bark Tank event was a powerful showcase for the aspiring entrepreneurs emerging from Georgetown,” Reid wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Through programs like Bark Tank, we help Georgetown students identify and channel their entrepreneurial energy to make the world better.”
Current Georgetown students, both undergraduate and graduate, as well as Georgetown alumni who have graduated in the last six months, were eligible to participate in the competition. This year’s winning venture was UHustle, a marketplace developed for students with side businesses to help them earn money through their side jobs through a streamlined online platform. UHustle, which was founded in October 2018 by Christy Felix (MSB ’20), Sinclaire Jones (MSB ’22) and Benjamin Ogbonna II (MSB ’20), was awarded $30,000 as the first place competitor.
Before this year’s Bark Tank, Felix had already won multiple Georgetown-associated  entrepreneurship competitions using UHustle, including Ventures and Values, Rocket Pitch and the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Challenge.
Felix plans on using the prize money from the Bark Tank competition to continue developing and improving UHustle’s platform in the hopes of expanding the venture’s staff in the coming months.
“Bark Tank gave UHustle the platform we needed to enhance our network and get help (for free),” Felix wrote. “We are currently looking for on campus coders to help UHustle improve upon our platform.”
In addition to UHustle, two other business ventures, Globally Unified Air Quality and Unveil, tied for second place in the Bark Tank competition, each earning $20,000 in prize money. 
The panel of judges who scored the event consisted of Leonsis and business industry leaders including Steve Barnes (CAS ’88, LAW ’92), co-founder and president of Homesnap, and Peter Biché (MSB ’78), CFO at Monumental Sports & Entertainment.
GUAQ addresses air pollution around the world through its development of a cost-effective air sensor technology, according to Pascal Girard, the team’s mentor and advisor.
“92% of the world’s population is breathing bad air. Not surprisingly, countries with the worst air pollution have the least (if any) Air Quality (AQ) monitoring,” Girard wrote in an email to The Hoya. “To address this disparity, Georgetown students and faculty are designing and building a highly modular, Internet-Of-Things air quality monitor.”
Georgetown entrepreneurs should take advantage of the campus resources available to students to develop their ideas, such as the Maker Hub and the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Challenge, according to Michael Bartholic (COL ’22), one of the founders of GUAQ, which began as a project created in the Maker Hub in Lauinger Library.
“I think it should not be understated how much one can accomplish with even modest resources and the commitment to experiment,” Bartholic wrote.
Unveil, the other second-place finisher, is a wellness brand that seeks to raise awareness about women’s health. The venture will donate a reusable sanitary product to a woman in a developing country for every undergarment sold in the U.S., according to Katie Fischer (GRD ’20), Unveil’s founder.
“While addressing health issues in the U.S. market, Unveil also addresses issues around menstrual hygiene management (MHM) in developing countries,” Fischer wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Fischer got the idea for her new business during a trip to Liberia, where she witnessed first-hand the challenges that many girls in the country faced around affording menstrual hygiene products.
Fischer plans to use the prize to further develop Unveil, including creating a viable prototype for early customers and guide future product progress, she wrote.
“With the funding I have won, I will now be able to develop MVPs, which is huge,” Fischer wrote. “With a product in hand, I can begin to crowdfund, beta test and continue to refine our business model.”

Georgetown University announced a new low-cost partnership with the Capital Bikeshare University Program to make bicycling more financially accessible for students.
Capital Bikeshare allows users the opportunity to temporarily rent bikes and park them at various stations throughout Washington, D.C. Georgetown’s partnership with the Bikeshare program will decrease annual membership costs for Capital Bikeshare from $85 to $25 for all Georgetown undergraduate, graduate, Law Center and Medical Center students, according to a Nov. 18 email from the Office of Planning and Facilities Management
Capital Bikeshare has approximately 4,500 bikes throughout D.C., Maryland and Virginia, including a docking station for bikes directly outside the front gates of the university. 
Currently, 5% of Georgetown University commuters use bikes to get to campus, according to the university website. The Bikeshare program could have positive environmental impacts as more students are incentivized to use bikes over other, less sustainable modes of travel, according to Audrey Stewart, director of the Office of Sustainability. 
“The new Capital Bikeshare discount program helps advance sustainability at the university by making it more convenient and more affordable for students to choose bicycling, a carbon-free mode of transportation,” Stewart wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
In addition to the discounted annual rate, the program also allows students to obtain discounts on helmets from local bicycle shops such as Bicycle Pro Shop on M Street, and grants the opportunity to attend a free Washington Area Bicyclist Association Confident City Cycling class, which teaches students of varying skill levels how to handle bikes and maneuver on bike trails. 
Initiatives started by the Georgetown University Student Association and Georgetown University Graduate Student Government encouraged the university to join the Bikeshare program, according to a university email. 
GUSA senator Joshua Marin-Mora (SFS ’21), who serves as the transportation and accessibility policy chair for the Senate, introduced a resolution calling for the university to adopt the discounted student Bikeshare program this past summer. The resolution received unanimous support during the regular term senate this fall in a vote Sept. 15.
The GUSA executive branch has also contributed to the initiative in meetings with the administration, according to Nicolo Ferretti (SFS ’21), director of university affairs for GUSA. Ferretti, alongside GUSA Transportation Policy Coalition Chair Clay Volino (SFS ’22), met with administrators earlier this semester to work through the university approval process, according to Ferretti.
The Bikeshare initiative was attractive to both GUSA and administrators because of the program’s easy implementation, according to Ferretti. 
“It quickly became one of our best project prospects because it didn’t require any university funding but only approval and a school-wide email,” Ferretti wrote in an email to The Hoya.   
Georgetown’s terrain poses difficulties for student cyclists. The League of American Bicyclists, an organization that promotes bicycle-friendly culture in the United States, deemed Georgetown a Bronze-level Bicycle Friendly university. The determination denotes that Georgetown cyclists face many physical obstacles to accessible cycling both at the university and within the District. 
The initiative will hopefully make cycling more financially accessible for students despite physical impediments on campus, according to Ferretti. 
“GUSA Transportation is always looking for ways to make the campus more accessible and give students ways to get out of the Georgetown bubble,” Ferretti wrote. “This program is a win for many of our teams.” 
Students can register for the program on the Capital Bikeshare website, where they can confirm their eligibility as students of the university to apply the discount. Once registered, students are free to use the Capital Bikeshare program for a year before needing to renew their membership.
Although the campus poses physical challenges for cyclists, the university has previously launched initiatives, including free monthly Bike Commuting 101 classes and 1,100 bicycle parking spaces across campus, to encourage bike riding. The Bikeshare program will be a welcome addition to the existing programs, according to Lindsey Bullen, a university transportation demand manager. “Georgetown is proud to offer other biking resources and services to students, faculty and staff,” Bullen wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are thrilled to be able to add an affordable, convenient, fun, and active program for our undergraduate, graduate, Law Center, and Medical Center students.”

Republicans and Democrats should work together to ensure the United States and Israel maintain a mutually beneficial relationship to benefit the future success of both countries, Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) said at a Nov. 20 event.
At the event “Rep. Gottheimer: The Democrats and the US-Israel Relationship,” Gottheimer discussed the current state of affairs between the United States and Israel regarding each nation’s economy and national security. Georgetown University College Democrats and Georgetown Israel Alliance co-sponsored the Wednesday event. 
Gottheimer serves as co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan coalition that seeks to address congressional dilemmas. He also co-sponsored the U.S.-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and Regional Security Act in July, which authorizes joint research and cooperation programs between the U.S. and Israel. 
Israel has long been a U.S. ally in the Middle East since the United States was the first nation to recognize Israel as a state in 1948 and Jerusalem as its capital in 2017. Remaining allies are necessary for regional protection and the international economy in both countries, according to Gottheimer.
“This relationship is essential to our national security and important to the region,” Gottheimer said. “Part of what is so important in the U.S.-Israel relationship is the economic relationship.”
From a U.S. political perspective, Republicans and Democrats should collaborate to develop policies that effectively navigate the U.S.-Israeli relationship, according to Gottheimer.
“The U.S.-Israeli relationship has always been a bipartisan issue and we must make sure this remains bipartisan,” Gottheimer said. 
The event comes after Israeli and Islamist forces on the Gaza Strip agreed to a tentative ceasefire Nov. 14 after two days of fighting between the groups. This ceasefire was threatened two days later, however, as Hamas, a Palestinian political and militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, launched two missiles into Israeli territory that were struck down by Israeli Air Defense systems, according to The Washington Post.
Certain news outlets have mischaracterized the nature of recent violence between Israel and Hamas, according to Gottheimer. 
“I think the media, depending on the outlet, are portraying this as an attack on the Palestinian side and forgetting that Israel is responding and not being proactive in their use of force,” Gottheimer said. 
Gottheimer also addressed the recent prevalence of antisemitism across the United States. Gottheimer has witnessed antisemitic hate crimes in schools in his district and while campaigning for his House seat, he said. 
“In only the last few months, we have had six swastikas found in middle schools,” Gottheimer said. “I’m used to swastikas on my campaign signs and have faced comments questioning my loyalty to the USA as a Jew.”
After President Donald Trump’s inauguration in 2017, hate crimes targeting Jews and Jewish institutions rose 37% in the United States. Several antisemitic events occurred at Georgetown in 2017, including antisemitic graffiti discovered near Makóm, the Jewish prayer space, and swastikas spray-painted in LXR Hall during Rosh Hashana the same year.
The growing trend of antisemitic sentiment in the United States has been exacerbated by social media, according to Gottheimer. 
“A simmering cauldron of anger has been unleashed because people feel they can say whatever they want and hide behind social media like cowards,” Gottheimer said. 
In a recent development in U.S.-Israeli foreign policy, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Nov. 18 that Trump’s administration determined Israeli settlements in the West Bank do not violate international law. More than 700,000 settlers reside in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, both of which are in regions claimed by Palestine. The announcement breaks with decades of preceding U.S. foreign policy, according to The Washington Post.
After Gottheimer addressed Georgetown community members, Maurice Zekaria (SFS ’21), a leader of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, led a question and answer period. A productive and impactful conversation came out of the event, according to Zekaria.
“I think it was a great event and a lot of people came out with diverse opinions,” Zekaria said in an interview with The Hoya. “It was a great exchange of ideas.” 
The event exemplified Georgetown student interest in the U.S.-Israeli relationship, Gottheimer said in an interview with The Hoya.
“There was a room full of very thoughtful students who asked many poignant questions,” Gottheimer said. “I am looking forward to coming back to Georgetown to address U.S. and Israel related issues.”

Speakers emphasized the importance of giving youth the tools they need to engage in activism at the Georgetown University Student Association department of student activism’s first ever Student Activism Summit on Nov. 16. 
The event featured 19 speakers with expertise in a range of social justice movements from increasing access to education to disability justice. Participants at the summit could attend a keynote address, talks on coalition building and power mapping — which is a way to visually identify who holds power in reaching a goal — and panels with alumni and university administration officials.  
Keynote speaker Diana Acosta, a program associate for Fair Finance with the Georgetown University Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation, spoke about the obstacles she faced as a young, Latinx immigrant and activist at Harvard University. Although many people ignore youth activists because of their age, young people should continue to share their perspectives and opinions, according to Acosta. 
“This was the context that I grew up in, feeling powerless because I was a child or young, and the perception was that young people shouldn’t speak up and that there is nothing that they can contribute,” Acosta said in her address. “That is a lie, and that is something that I’ve known from a young age, when I knew I had great ideas and I knew I wanted to change the world but no one was listening.” 
Though some activists have a tendency to drown other voices out with their enthusiasm, listening is an essential part of activism, according to Acosta.
“Sometimes we think activism is again like this flashy space for us to be in, or this space for us to vocalize, vocalize, vocalize,” Acosta said. “But sometimes it’s hard for us to listen, and to sit back and hear what others are saying, and to actually understand that, you know it means stepping back too.” 
Summit attendees involved in student activism came from across the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Acosta’s keynote on the importance of listening stuck out to Kavya Mishra, who attended the summit with the student activism club at Thomas S. Wootton High School in Rockville, Md. 
“We do a lot of action and we put a lot of ourselves forward, but another part of activism is stepping back and listening and being able to understand what’s going on before we take action,” Mishra said in an interview with The Hoya. 
A week before the summit, Hoyas for Immigrant Rights organized the #HomeIsHere walkout Nov. 8 before a Supreme Court hearing on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Forty other university clubs and organizations co-sponsored the event and 157 students participated.  
Youth experience with digital media made for a more effective publicity strategy, according to panelist Gerson Quinteros, a community organizer at United We Dream, an immigrant youth-led organization that was involved in the #HomeIsHere walkout. 
“They bring a lot of energy, a lot of creativity, that’s one thing the youth bring, and new, fresh ideas that we may not be thinking about, because we’re stuck in this bubble,” Quinteros said in the panel. “Some of you might be part of the digital world, and the digital world brings up a lot of new ways to reach out to people, we just did the walkout and we were using TikTok for that.”
The summit was designed to motivate and instruct student activists, according to GUSA Executive Co-Directors of Student Activism Austin Riddick (COL ’20) and Hannah Levine (COL ’21), who organized the summit.
“The vision was to provide students with the tools and inspiration to make their activism as effective as possible in whatever field they choose,” Riddick wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We looked for speakers mostly in the DMV area and tried to get representation in a wide range of issue areas and life experiences.” 
Not all students are informed or involved in activism; however, small actions of goodwill can correct that problem, Acosta said. 
“Activism can take shape in many ways, which means that you can do something seemingly small to change what is going on around us,” Acosta said. “Everything from cleaning up after yourself or noticing if someone needs a helping hand — there’s so many ways that we can make activism happen and be a reality for us.”

Universities should provide institutionalized support to their undocumented students, panelists said at a Nov. 7 conference on Georgetown University’s campus organized ahead of Supreme Court hearings on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Many undocumented students rely on DACA, an immigration policy that allows some individuals who came to the country without documentation as children to receive a two-year period of deferred action from deportation, obtain work permits and attend college. The program, enacted by former president Barack Obama, was ended in 2017 by President Donald Trump, but the Supreme Court began hearing arguments on the legality of Trump’s decision Nov. 12. As of right now, current or former DACA recipients are still able to apply for renewals. 
Financial inequality, in addition to other roadblocks, prevents undocumented people from accessing higher education as easily as U.S. citizens. The disparity violates Article 26 of the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that higher education should be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit, according to Executive Director of Freedom University Laura Soltis.
“For people who are moving across borders, it’s important that they know that regardless of where they were born or what borders they cross, they have fundamental human rights by virtue of being human,” Soltis said. 
Freedom University, a school for undocumented students that provides tuition-free college preparation classes and scholarship assistance, was founded by a group of undocumented students, documented student allies, immigrant rights activists and four professors at the University of Georgia. The group’s formation came as a response to the 2010 decision by the Georgia Board of Regents to ban undocumented students from attending Georgia’s top five public universities or receiving in-state tuition, according to the university website.
Similar admissions bans have also been passed in Alabama and South Carolina, limiting undocumented students’ access to college, many of which have faced appeals. Because of these admissions bans, many DACA recipients hold work permits and jobs, but are not able to receive higher education, according to Soltis.
“It has normalized a system where a whole population of young people of color can legally drive to their low wage jobs with their driver’s license and their work permit, but still can be denied access to a higher education and the right to vote,” Soltis said. 
The conference, titled “Pursuits & Persistence: Undocumented Student Success in Higher Education,” was co-hosted by the Institute for the Study of International Migration, a multidisciplinary center that studies multiple dimensions of international migration, as well as by Georgetown University’s Center for Multicultural Equity and Access. The panels for the conference in the Healey Family Student Center featured speakers from various universities who discussed the past, present and future of undocumented students in higher education.
Despite DACA’s uncertain fate, efforts across college campuses to support equal education, such as scholarships for first generation college students, can still work to improve undocumented students’ access to education, according to Arelis Palacios, associate director for undocumented student services at Georgetown.
“My daily goal is to quite literally make sure that more students are able to access college, able to access educational opportunities beyond undergraduate,” Palacios said.
Georgetown has representatives from 17 different offices on campus who support students without documentation, according to the university website. The university also joined 18 other colleges and universities in signing an amicus brief expressing support for DACA on Oct. 7. The brief identified the contributions and diverse perspectives that DACA recipients bring to the university’s campus and includes the stories of three Georgetown students without documentation.
While Palacios acknowledges that the current system of support for undocumented students at Georgetown is not perfect, she says she hopes that more progress can be made if everyone works together.
“I do the work because I’m human, and I care about human dignity, and I care about what it means for us to do this work,” Palacios said. “We have to recognize that it’s about helping each other, and really, quite literally, engaging in different levels of community care and collective care to support each other.”

While universities in the United States have made progress in admitting a more diverse student body, schools must better support low-income and first-generation students throughout their college experiences, assistant professor of education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education Anthony Jack said at an event Thursday.
The event, titled “A Conversation with Tony Jack,” was hosted by the Georgetown Scholars Program, a campus organization that provides support, advising, networking and mentoring to over 600 Georgetown undergraduates, most of whom are first-generation college students or come from low-income family backgrounds. At the event, Jack discussed his first book, “The Privileged Poor: How Elite Colleges Are Failing Disadvantaged Students.”
Despite the recent efforts of many selective universities to increase the diversity in their student bodies, the emphasis on admitting more low-income, first-generation students often does not translate into a greater effort to provide support to these students, according to Jack.
“You can diversify a campus all you want,” Jack said. “We all know that just because you gain access doesn’t mean that you have access to the resources of that place.”
Universities often only focus on improving overall admissions and graduation rates of lower-income students without paying attention to issues these students may be facing on a day-to-day basis, Jack said.
“We only focus on who gets in and who gets out,” Jack said. “We never focus on the experience throughout college life, those overlooked moments between convocation and commencement.” 
In his book, Jack reflects on his own experience transitioning from a low-income, public school background to a selective, private high school and university. Based on his observations, he distinguishes between two different groups within the low-income college student population: the “doubly disadvantaged,” low-income students coming from public schools, and the “privileged poor,” those who attended private or boarding schools.
A large majority of the low-income students whom universities admit are part of the privileged poor, according to Jack. This tendency prevents universities from making practical progress in increasing opportunities in higher education for low-income college students, Jack said.
“If you’re getting such a significant number of your lower-income students who also were taught by the Harkness method, who were taught by Ph.D.s in high school, who studied abroad in high school, you won’t feel the pressure to do as much work to incorporate, include them into the conversation, because you’re so used to people already doing that themselves,” Jack said.
The Harkness method is a learning method primarily practiced in boarding schools involving students seated at a large, oval table to encourage free discussion with minimal teacher intervention. 
While the doubly disadvantaged and the privileged poor both experience the financial burden inherent to higher education, the privileged poor come to colleges better equipped because of their earlier exposure to the kinds of practices expected of college students, according to Jack. 
“When we talk about social class in higher education, it’s always one of two things: tuition costs and how much money you have or social class in the form of cultural capital, like do you feel comfortable having certain conversations about where you can go for vacation and other things like that,” Jack said. 
Of the top 12 high schools that sent the most students to Georgetown in 2014, eight were boarding schools, and two were private schools. More recently, Georgetown ranked 12th on a 2017 New York Times study detailing income inequality at universities, with more students coming from the top 1%, defined as families with an annual income higher than $630,000, than students coming from the bottom 60%, defined as having an income less than $65,000.
Universities must work towards gaining a greater understanding of the diverse backgrounds and hardships of low-income college students, according to Jack.
“That ignorance is hard to navigate because the people who often control the purse strings of the university have the least amount of contact with students and have the least knowledge of the kind of environment, home situations and experiences en route to college of what our students have,” Jack said. “And until we change that, until we actually understand the true profile of our student body, we will continue to fail our students in ways that we actually can help them.”

Catholic opposition to Pope Francis is scandalous and unprecedented, Washington, D.C. Archbishop Wilton Gregory said at a Nov. 21 panel.
The panel focused on the impact Francis has had during his six years leading the Catholic Church and challenges that he pope currently faces, particularly the clergy sexual abuse crisis. Gregory was joined by Helen Alvaré, an anti-abortion advocate and law professor at George Mason University, and John Carr, director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University at the event in the Dahlgren Chapel of the Sacred Heart.
The panelists spoke about the resistance movement within the Catholic Church against Francis, as well as the implications of the issues he has chosen to prioritize on during his time as pope. The speakers also reflected on the challenges currently facing the church, including the clergy sexual abuse crisis and controversies about the role of women. 
The extent of the pushback against the relatively liberal Francis, who was named pope in 2013, is anomalous, even for an ancient institution like the Catholic Church, according to Gregory.
“Opposition to the pope is not new, but what is new is the level and intensity that is there,” Gregory said. “It’s the insidiousness of the opposition movement that I think is scandalous for us.”
The Office of Mission and Ministry and the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life hosted the panel, “The Francis Factor Today,” as part of the Dahlgren Dialogues series. The series, which was started in October 2017, features conversations with leaders on contemporary issues involving faith and public life.  
Francis has emphasized the church’s teachings on protecting the environment, embracing migrants and being more inclusive toward LGBTQ Catholics. Many Catholics oppose Pope Francis because of personal or political motivations, rather than with constructive criticism, Carr said.
“I think people try to use Francis to their own ends,” he said. “I think they try to score points. I think they try to get clicks. I think they try to lift up their own visibility.”
Public controversy over Francis’ leadership has lasted for years. Journalist Ross Douthat warned that Francis could increase opposition from conservative Catholics and divide the church in a 2015 article in The Atlantic. In 2017, a high-ranking German cardinal spoke out to oppose Francis’ support of reforming the church’s ban on divorced Catholics receiving communion.
The widespread use of social media can also explain why the opposition movement to Francis may appear to have more traction than opposition to previous popes, according to Gregory.
“Social media gives the opposition a megaphone,” Gregory said. “The Holy Father has to deal with divisions that are trumpeted with no control.”
The way the pope responded to his own mistakes handling the cover-up of the clergy sexual abuse scandal in Chile demonstrated his leadership, Gregory said.
While in Chile, Francis accused survivors of sexual assault of slandering the priests who abused them. Francis later apologized for his statements, saying he received inaccurate information and taking responsibility for contributing to the crisis. Gregory was impressed by the pope’s humility. 
“His apology was stunning,” Gregory said. “He’s revealed his humanity in startling ways.”
The pope has also attempted to address the unequal representation of women in the church. 
The direct way that Francis speaks about the need for increased involvement of women in the church is effective in bringing attention to the issue, according to Alvaré, who is the adviser to the Pontifical Council of the Laity and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
“One of the cool things about Pope Francis is he’s very blunt steering a big ship,” Alvaré said. “He says big things about the role of women in the church, and he says them many times, and I’m glad for that because this ship has to be moved.”
The pope’s mantra of emphasizing service over servitude is something that should be applied to women’s role in the church, according to Alvaré.
“I think there needs to be more of an involvement of women on an ongoing basis,” Alvaré said. “We’re not starting from scratch. There’s women doing all kinds of things. But we’re not celebrating it enough, and we’re not realizing it enough.”

What’s scandalous is a pope who is harboring Bishop Zanchetta in Santa Marta in Rome.  Zanchetta is also from Argentina, and the pope knew him very well.  The Pope promoted Zanchetta to bishop knowing full well that Zhanchetta was a boy-chaser. 
What’s scandalous is all the perfumed princes of the Church, safe in their jobs, NOT cleaning out the house.

I think that the Pope shoild replace many of the most conservative opposition.  It is time for the church to modernize,  to move forward, giving women and married members more of a role in the church.

“Mundus totus in maligno positus erat [the whole world was set in evil]: there was no longer any holiness; justice was failing and truth buried. Iniquity reigned, avarice ruled; Simon Magus possessed the Church, the bishops and priests were given over the sensual pleasure and fornication…Such was the the Church, such were the bishops and priests, such were some among the Roman Pontiffs.” St. Bruno, De Simoniacis
Could have been written just this morning! St. Bruno, pray for us!

James A Mitchell says

But what sort of response would you expect from such a scandalous and unprecedented pope?

Joe says 
November 25, 2019 at 8:36 am
But archbishop – in the words of your pope – who are you to judge?

Andrew says 
November 25, 2019 at 1:40 pm
Pope Francis is not my Pope. Pope Benedict was. I do have compassion for divorced and Gay people and Pope Francis’s urging that we as Catholics embrace them further. I also believe that knowingly doing harm to God’s Creation (the environment) is a sin whose gravity is dependent on the gravity of the action – potentially very grave. 
But, he has also brought back known child molesters who were “purged” by Benedict. Much of the weirdness in the Church stems from having unmarried priests, which attracts people with Gay tendencies or unresolved sexual immaturity. So, I am also disaffected from that perspective. The Ukrainian Catholic Church, for example, allows married priests, but they must be married before attaining the rank of Deacon, otherwise not a chance. That is unfair as I know priests living under conditions of great loneliness and there is an open secret that they often engage in relations with post-menopausal women. 
I don’t trust this Argentine Socialist who believes in One World government and Global Warming, issues that are outside of his brief and above his pay grade. The former would have us living under One World Tyranny and the latter ignores the Medieval and Roman warming period, which was warmer than today without human industry. 
Finally, he coddles Islam, making false statements about what is in the Koran. Peacefulness does not require us to be delusional. In fact, we must insist on truth, because the Truth is our Lord. The Catholic Pope is not required to play “Useful Idiot” to Muslim leaders who say the exact opposite when speaking Arabic than they do when making false promises to the Pope. Read this:
https://www.raymondibrahim.com/2019/11/25/the-two-faced-muslim-that-pope-francis-loves-and-trusts/
So, I have made the decision that Pope Francis is not my Pope. If that makes me a bad Catholic, then that is a risk I am taking.

Andrew says 
November 25, 2019 at 4:38 pm
I see that what I wrote before is too hot for you and you would like to censor it. Shame on you!  As I look at your website, it is full of weak and ill considered opinions, so no loss there for me.

Since 1848 the Vatican Bureaucracy has been adrift without a rudder in a world caught up in a storm of change. At the heart of the matter is not a matter of doctrine or liturgy; it is the fact that the Vatican is a court. The catholic church is ruled by a monarch and as with all monarchies the courtiers seize privileges and power. In a monarchy it is not possible to abide by the principle of subsidiarity, a traditional catholic teaching, all power must flow from the centre. Finally, a monarchy denies all rights to its subjects just a the does the present code of canon law. Get real, folks!

Pope Francis with “Who am I to judge?”, to the Fillippjne people “practice “responsible parenthood” and don’t have to breed “like rabbits.”.  Such arrogance.

Loved reading the article. Each time you believe you’re being dismissed God’s really diverting you to something better. Request that he give you the solidarity to press forward. Thanks for sharing.

As violence escalates in Hong Kong, newsrooms must make careful decisions about how they present the events of the protests, United States Bureau Chief for the South China Morning Post Robert Delaney said at a Nov. 18 event.
The event titled “Perspective of Journalism in Hong Kong” was co-hosted by SCMP and the Hong Kong Student Association. At the event, Delaney reflected on the current status of reporting about the situation in Hong Kong. 
Protests began in the region this June in response to a bill proposed by the Hong Kong government that would permit the Chinese government to extradite criminal suspects from Hong Kong. The bill, introduced in February by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, was withdrawn Sept. 4. However, protesters have continued to demonstrate since the bill’s retraction, demanding Hong Kong’s government address issues of police brutality and increase democratic freedom.
Violence surrounding the protests in Hong Kong has escalated recently, as protesters armed themselves with firebombs and bows and arrows against police in their demonstrations. 
With the most recent phase of protests exhibiting the most violence yet, newsroom debates about how to characterize protesters have been prevalent, Delaney said.
“Everyone who’s out on the street, whether they’re just walking quietly and peacefully towards Victoria Park and doing nothing more than showing up, are protesters,”  Delaney said. “At the same time you have someone showing up and throwing a molotov cocktail at a police officer and it goes up in flames. If you read the coverage and look at the way we’re characterizing these different groups of protesters, you’ll see some differences.”
In newsrooms, the ethics of whether to identify protesters is a contentious topic, according to Delaney.
“That’s a discussion that causes a lot of handwringing and heartburn in the newsroom,” Delaney said.
As unrest in Hong Kong continues, Delaney said that he cannot predict the future of the protest movement. He said he had expected the protests to settle as China and Hong Kong maintained business relations and underestimated social tensions.
“I had this assumption that was a bit insulting, I now realize, that as long as Beijing allows business to continue as usual, no one is going to get too upset in Hong Kong,” Delaney said. “Well, I was dead wrong. I didn’t understand and I didn’t anticipate the depth of feeling that is happening in Hong Kong.” 
After more than 150 years of British colonial rule, Hong Kong fell back under Chinese authority in 1997 and became a Special Administrative Region, functioning under a “one country, two systems” policy that allows the region a significant level of autonomy. The protested bill produced controversy over the functional autonomy of Hong Kong given the bill’s extradition allowances.
Not enough people understand the significance of Hong Kong’s colonial past to the current government of China and to Chinese people, according to Delaney.
“I think the depth of that concern and that sensitivity is missed on a lot of people in the U.S., and as much as we possibly can, we try to point that out,” Delaney said. “In the day-to-day reporting, it’s not really something that you can factor into every story.”
Fifteen Georgetown students studying abroad in Hong Kong this semester were told to leave their programs last week following the uptick in political unrest in the city. Within the last week, the previously isolated demonstrations reached the universities Georgetown students were enrolled in, culminating in protesters setting a university building on fire.
Delaney joined SCMP after nearly 20 years of experience working in journalism. Delaney spent 11 years as a correspondent in China for Dow Jones Newswires and Bloomberg covering economics before joining SCMP.
Although journalists have a wide range of stances on the situation in Hong Kong, journalists must still be conscious they are presenting the news accurately, Delaney said.
“I’m not going to lie; there are differences of opinions within the newsroom,” Delaney said.  “At the end of the day we have to deliver a report that is going to be as objective as possible.”

The Georgetown University Graduate Student Government has begun drafting a proposal to implement a subsidized metro pass system for full-time graduate students to increase financial accessibility to transportation.
The draft proposal from GradGov requests that the university participate in the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority’s University Pass program, which provides unlimited riding privileges to District-area students at a discounted price through a transportation card. The cost of the U-Pass for students would be reflected in a calculated rise in tuition of $130 a semester for full-time graduate students based on the value of the card, according to the draft proposal. The cost of the U-Pass for students is $1 per day, which is less than the $2 one-way Metrobus fare.
GradGov plans to submit a formal proposal to the Georgetown administration by Feb. 1. Following the submission, the group hopes to come to an agreement with the university that the school will implement the program should it be approved in a student referendum. 
Should an agreement be reached, the program and the associated mandatory tuition increase will then be voted on in the student referendum, which GradGov hopes to hold in the spring with the intention of starting the program by the fall 2020 semester, according to Lewis May, a second-year graduate student in the School of Foreign Service and president of GradGov.
Implementing the U-Pass program will make transportation more affordable for the many students commuting to campus, according to May.
“It’s insane to me that there’s no subsidized public transport at a university where you can’t drive to campus during the day and all graduate students live off campus,” May said. “I feel like transport and having free transport is like one of the most slam dunk ways that you can ensure equitable access to campus.”
While the university provides free Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle buses to some areas of the city, GUTS buses only run on five routes and operate only on weekdays and a limited basis on Saturdays, according to the university transportation website. Transportation options are limited for students who live and work in different parts of the city, according to Henry Watson, a first-year PhD student in the department of government and advocacy director of GradGov.
“While the GUTS bus is an absolutely invaluable resource which is of great value to many students, it does not (and cannot) connect Georgetown University to the entire city,” Watson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Travelling into the city is mandatory for many graduate students who must take on unpaid internships as part of their academic programs.”
While the program comes with a mandatory tuition increase, the initiative would still benefit students because the cost of the U-Pass is less than the current cost of transportation for students, according to Watson.
“The costs of transportation may seem low, but they are important to graduate students living on tight budgets,” Watson wrote. “The $1/day fee structure represents a cost savings even to light users of the transit system.”
The current proposal is directed at obtaining the U-Pass program for graduate and law students only. However, GradGov hopes to eventually bring the U-Pass program to undergraduate students as well, according to May. 
In addition to making traveling around the District more affordable, a U-Pass system at Georgetown would support a more environmentally sustainable transportation method, Watson wrote.
“Providing free access to public transportation will take cars off the road,” Watson wrote. “This not only helps to reduce traffic in and out of Georgetown University, it promotes environmental sustainability and reduces emissions.”
The U-Pass program has already been put into place at several universities in the Washington, D.C. area, including Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College, the Washington College of Law and American University. AU adopted the U-Pass program in the fall of 2016 following a successful student referendum. The program provided AU students with over 1.5 million Metro rides in the first year of its implementation, according to the WMATA website.
Georgetown should follow AU’s lead in making transportation more financially accessible for graduate students, according to Watson, who completed his master’s degree at AU last year.
“The cost of transportation creates a discouragement for myself and other students to explore parks and museums, attend special events, partake in community service, and fully take advantage of the experiential learning opportunities off campus,” Watson wrote. “American University has opened up the region to its students through U-Pass, but Georgetown has yet to follow suit.”


Rongfeng says 
November 25, 2019 at 3:15 pm
It would be great if U-Pass is available for graduate students!

Georgetown University students and faculty deliberated over strategies and encouraged the university to attempt to accelerate the return of Victor Liu (COL ’21) and his sister, who are being prevented from leaving China, at a Nov. 17 event. 
Chinese authorities barred Liu and his sister, Cynthia Liu, from leaving China since June 2018 in an attempt to compel their estranged father, Liu Changming, to face criminal charges in Chinese court. Changming, who left China in 2007 and cut ties with his children and wife in 2012, is accused of facilitating a $1.4 billion fraud scheme during his tenure at a state-owned bank and is among one of China’s most wanted criminals. 
The siblings first traveled to China in June 2018 with their mother, Sandra Han, to visit their dying grandfather. Days after their arrival, the siblings lost contact with their mother, who was detained and sent to a secret holding facility. All three are U.S. citizens. 
The Lius’ case comes as the United States and China have engaged in a trade war, a geopolitical struggle that has made the Lius’ return increasingly difficult, according to Evan Medeiros, the Penner Family chair in Asian studies in the School of Foreign Service and a Cling Family senior fellow in U.S.-China Relations. 
“What the Chinese are focused on is negotiating this big trade deal with the Trump administration, and, as a result, the situation of Victor and Cynthia is a chit that the Chinese are trying to figure out — what kind of leverage can they elicit from the United States,” Medeiros said at the discussion.
The event, titled “Detained in China: One Year Later, What Can We Do?”, was organized by the Asian American Student Association Political Awareness Committee Co-chairs Leina Hsu (COL ’22) and Gina Kang (SFS ’22). After a brief presentation by Hsu and Kang, Victor Liu’s personal friends offered anecdotes about Liu and called on the Georgetown administration to do more to facilitate his release. 
The university should increase publicity on the issue and reevaluate Georgetown’s relationship with China, according to Noor Darwish (MSB ’21), Liu’s freshman year roommate. 
“It’s been a year, and we haven’t gotten a statement from the president’s office about Victor’s situation, and that would really generate a lot of noise in the media and hopefully spur policymakers to do something,” Darwish said at the event. “We have 10 partners in China — different universities, different organizations. It would really be a big statement if we cut off those ties.” 
The university’s global engagement office has 29 partners in China, including The Beijing Center for Chinese Studies, a Jesuit educational center offering coursework and programing, and excursions to increase the world’s understanding of China; the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, an executive state agency; and the China Construction Bank, a major bank in China. 
Two university officials offered insights into the administration’s efforts to free the siblings. The university has met with senior U.S. government officials, including President Donald Trump and contacts in China, to help Liu and his family, according to Joe Ferrara, chief of staff to University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95).
“We have engaged in constant advocacy for Victor and Cynthia and their family,” Ferrara said at the discussion. “The message we’re trying to send in all of this is that we look at Victor as a member of the Georgetown community, and the most important thing we do every day is to try and protect the safety and security of the Georgetown community.” 
Ferrara has been in routine communication with Liu since June 2018, he said. 
Government officials familiar with the case, including Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have advocated for the siblings’ release with little success, according to Medeiros. 
“The U.S. has raised this multiple times at very, very high levels, and the Chinese response, to my understanding, is sort of some equivalent of, ‘How much is it worth to you?’” Medeiros said.
Liu, who would have begun his junior year this semester, studied classics and economics his freshman year and was deeply involved in Hilltop Consultants and the Georgetown University Student Investment Fund on campus. 
The Georgetown University Student Association executive called on China to immediately release the siblings and advocated for the U.S. government to work to return Victor and Cynthia Liu in a Nov. 14 statement. 
“The Georgetown University Student Association considers the wrongful detainment of Victor and Cynthia Liu an attack on our community,” the statement said. “We are committed to continue advocating for our international humanitarian rights on behalf of all of our individual members.”

Georgetown University students launched a petition Nov. 14 supporting the opening of Call Your Mother Deli after local politicians called for the Board of Zoning Adjustment to deny the popular bagel deli’s pending zoning application. 
The petition protesting the delay of Call Your Mother’s opening has 456 signatures from students and community members at the time of publication. The BZA postponed a decision Oct. 30 about whether or not to permit the restaurant to open at the corner of 35th and O Streets to Dec. 4. 
To be allowed to open in the iconic pink building at 3428 O St. NW, formerly Greenworks Florist, Call Your Mother needs a zoning variance, an exception to the space’s current designation for retail. Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E passed a resolution supporting the variance 6-2 on Oct. 2.
Washington, D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) and ANC 2E Commissioner and Chair Rick Murphy dissented and wrote letters to BZA opposing the exception Oct. 17 and Oct. 22, respectively, before the BZA deferred its decision. 
Call Your Mother has its first location in Petworth and a stand at the Georgetown University Farmers’ Market. The prospect of the trendy deli, recently listed on Bon Appetit’s top 50 nominees for best new restaurants nationwide, having a brick-and-mortar location in the neighborhood excites students, according to Christian Mandrakos (MSB ’20), who started the petition. 
“Like many other students, we were looking forward to the restaurant’s opening, having tried their food before at the Farmers’ Market,” Mandrakos wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Many of us viewed it as an affordable, high-quality food alternative with a convenient location.”
Mandrakos said the news about the deli’s opposition gave rise to the idea, and his friend Esther Doerr (COL ’20) suggested he start a petition to share the perspective of Georgetown students. 
Evans cited concerns about the increased traffic Call Your Mother could bring to the neighborhood, from frequent truck deliveries and customers driving to the location, in his Oct. 17 letter. 
“All of this would affect the quality of life for these residents,” Evans wrote. 
The Georgetown neighborhood already accommodates long lines at popular restaurants without a problem, according to Call Your Mother owner Andrew Dana.
“Well, I don’t know what the detriment to the neighborhood of there being a line is. Even the Georgetown Cupcake line is a very calm line, so I would push back on Jack Evans’ comments and say I don’t know what the negative impact is there,” Dana said in an interview with The Hoya. “We truly do just want to be a neighborhood-based restaurant.”
Dana ultimately wants to open several Call Your Mother locations that will cater to their individual neighborhoods.
“We’re not on TV like Georgetown Cupcakes or anything like that, we just want to be a part of the community, and I also think the fact that we have another location in Parkview and plans to open another one in Capitol Hill shows that our future vision is to truly be neighborhood-based and not to be drawing people in from other neighborhoods,” he said.
The Dec. 4 hearing is an opportunity for Call Your Mother to demonstrate its value to the surrounding neighborhood, Dana said. 
“We’re trying to stay optimistic that, on Dec. 4, they will give us approval, and if they give us approval Dec. 4, we’ll be ready to open a couple days after that,” he said. “We’re continuing to show that we’re good neighbors and we’re going to do everything in our power to make sure it’s smooth and there’s no issues.”
A bagel at Call Your Mother starts at $2.50, and the deli offers sandwiches like challah sub roll cheesesteak concepts. It fills the need for more affordable breakfast and lunch options close to campus, according to signatory Katherine Evanko (MSB ’20), who lives on 35th Street.
“Saxby’s bagels are very gross,” she wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We need good bagels and inexpensive breakfast options in the neighborhood.”
Cheap and fast off-campus dining options are limited in the Georgetown neighborhood. Currently, Wisemiller’s Grocery and Deli and Saxby’s are the only counter service breakfast or lunch spots within three blocks of campus. They accept GOCard debit dollars, and Dana has said he will look into accepting GOCard at Call Your Mother, too.
Call Your Mother would be both convenient and affordable for students, according to Rachel Staats (COL ’20).
“As a student living one block away, I think [Call Your Mother] would be a great way to address the lack of affordable food options in the area. Any resident who is against their opening must not have tried their za’atar bagel,” she wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Staats also commented on the online petition: “yes!! give me za’atar bagel or give me death.”
The petition is a welcome show of neighborhood support in the face of opposition that would otherwise be disheartening, according to Dana. 
“Georgetown students are just as much a part of the neighborhood as somebody who lives in a house there and has, you know, been a resident, so I think it’s important that the Georgetown students’ voices are heard and this just shows us that most of the neighborhood does support us and is into it,” he said. “It just really motivates us in this slog of trying to open. It’s easy to get frustrated, and seeing stuff like this really gets us motivated.”

Thank you, Georgetown, for signing the petition to recall Jack Evans. http://ward2citizensrecall.org/

Zoning is an insult to the free market and responsible for the out of control cost of renting and subsequent inequality in this country.

It’s nice that the kids are enthusiastic.  I might have been too when I was at Georgetown.  However, they are not full stake-holders in neighborhood (nor really in society yet, for that matter).  They would be largely unaffected by (if not contributing to) the negative effects this place would have on the community.  Rats, traffic, lines spilling into the street (as regularly happens at the cupcake place), sanitation issues when folks fail to find the bin for their wrappers, noise, not to mention the potential future effects when Five Guys or a similar place tries to make a play based on the precedent.  That doesn’t even begin to address the effects on property values.  With all due respect, I think students’ voices should be given limited weight here.

The renovated Copley Crypt Chapel of the North American Martyrs and St. William Chapel, located in Copley Hall, reopened Nov. 18 after being closed since March 2018. 
The Copley Crypt Chapel is in the Copley Hall basement and St. William Chapel is located above it on the first floor. The renovations to Copley Crypt Chapel and St. William Chapel were completed in two phases: the first being exterior renovations, followed by interior upgrades. Renovations for both chapels included reconfiguring mobility ramps and restoring windows, flooring, stained glass and roofing, according to a university spokesperson. Improvements to fire hazard protection, electrical work and security were also added to the chapels. 
Copley Crypt Chapel, which can only be entered through the back of Copley Hall, will be open for Orthodox Christian liturgical services and weekly Catholic mass Monday through Thursday at 10 p.m. The St. William Chapel is used for Protestant services and related activities. Both chapels were last renovated in 1995.
St. William Chapel, which can be used for Protestant weddings, has 125 chairs. Copley Crypt Chapel has seating for 65 people and is too small for weddings. However, baptisms may be held there, according to a university spokesperson. 
Renovating the chapels ensured that both spaces will continue to be used for prayer services and activities, according to a university spokesperson. 
“This project was critical to assure that both chapel spaces remain viable worship and gathering venues, and prevent further degradation of the building envelope and interior finishes,” a university spokesperson wrote in a statement to The Hoya. 
Copley Crypt Chapel was established in 1932 in honor of eight Jesuit missionaries from France who were killed in the mid-seventeenth century, according to a university spokesperson. The stained glass windows in the chapel are dedicated to the eight murdered Jesuit missionaries. The chapel is decorated with iconography typical to both Catholic and Orthodox Christian religious worship. 
Copley Crypt Chapel was originally used for the wakes of Jesuits before their burial in the Jesuit Cemetery, located below the entrance to the Copley Crypt Chapel.
Knights of Columbus at Georgetown University used Copley Crypt Chapel for meetings and activities in the past, according to Knights of Columbus member Paul Keh (SFS ’20). The sense of unity that meetings in the chapel fostered helped create a close knit student community, according to Keh. 
“When I first came to Georgetown, I was very unsure of where I was,” Kuh said. “But the one thing that was constant for me was the fact that within sacred places there was always a place to be quiet and to recognize there was something bigger than me. So this particular place, Copley Crypt, means a lot to me.”
The completed renovations to Copley Crypt Chapel come after the Oct. 25 announcement of the spring 2020 establishment of a multi-Dharmic worship space and the opening of the new Georgetown University Masjid, a Muslim prayer space, on Aug. 30. Dahlgren Chapel, the primary space for Catholic services, was renovated in 2012. 
The chapel renovations have kept important original structural elements while improving on necessary areas, according to Keh.
“All the important parts remained exactly the same, the altars are the same, the cross is the same, the arrangement of the chairs is the same, and all the parts that could have been improved, were improved,” Keh said. “I’m very pleased with what they’ve done. I’m just really grateful.”
The renovated Copley Crypt Chapel is an inclusive space where students can gather together and take time to pray and reflect, according to Director for Catholic Life and Campus Liturgist Jim Wickman.
“My hope is that Copley Crypt Chapel will be a place on campus where any and all students find a home,” Wickman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is a beautiful and simple space, where one can enter, sit — even if just for a few minutes — and feel the quiet and peace. It is a place where one can pray, meditate, reflect, and feel centered once again.”

Environmental injustice and disasters are linked to issues surrounding disability, poverty and racism, University of Alabama social and cultural studies professor Nirmala Erevelles said at an event Nov. 13.
The event “Disability, Eco(in)justice and Transnational Solidarity,” was sponsored by the disability studies program, the South Asian Society and Rangila, an annual, student-run philanthropic showcase of South Asian dance. Erevelles focused on how ecological injustice creates barriers for marginalized groups, citing environmental crises in Bhopal, India and Flint, Mich.
An act of negligence led to a gas leak at the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal in 1984 that exposed 600,000 residents to 30 tons of toxic and poisonous gas. The pesticide plant accident, caused by water entering a tank of toxic methyl isocyanate, caused the deaths of between 3,800 to 16,000 residents, according to The Atlantic. 
The pesticide plant accident disproportionately affected impoverished citizens in Bhopal who were forced to live in affordable housing made cheaper by its proximity to the plant, according to Erevelles. 
“Because Bhopal in India was promising jobs, there were a lot of people who migrated from the rural areas into the city and because they couldn’t afford housing in the big city, they built these little shantytowns across from the plant,” Erevelles said. “On the day when the gases escaped from the plant, people were dying in the space because many of them lived outside.”
The incident in Bhopal demonstrates how social and historical context in environmental crises can cause marginalized community members to become disabled, according to Erevelles.  
“Where here you don’t get just born with a disability, you could become disabled within certain violent historical, social and political conditions,” Erevelles said. “You’re not just born disabled, you can become disabled because of this kind of environmental injustice.” 
The water crisis in Flint, Mich. parallels the situation in Bhopal, India, according to Erevelles. In 2014, the city of Flint switched its municipal water source to a pipeline connected to the Flint River in order to cut costs for the town. After the pipeline switch, residents reported changes in water color and smell. In 2015, the water in Flint was tested and found to contain dangerous levels of lead, among other possible contaminants. 
Governmental negligence in addressing the Flint water crisis in a timely manner has led to numerous negative health outcomes, according to Erevelles. 
“It can cause health problems, it can decrease bone and muscle growth, poor muscle coordination, damage to the nervous system, kidneys or hearing, speech and language problems, developmental delays, seizures and unconsciousness in cases of extremely high lead levels and behavioral challenges,” Erevelles said.
The Flint water crisis has been unresolved for four years, leading to criticism of the government’s slow response. Reluctance to aid the people of Flint, nearly half of whom are black, is largely because of a lack of value placed on black lives, according to Erevelles. 
“Vulnerable bodies are devalued,” Erevelles said. “An invulnerable body, we presume, produces profit. A vulnerable body sucks profit from spaces.”
To address conversation surrounding disabilities on campus, Georgetown University approved the disability studies minor in 2017, after three years of advocacy by the Disability Studies Minor Working Group. The minor focuses on the intersectionality between disability, philosophy and women’s and gender studies, among other disciplines.
Georgetown can better understand the connection between disability and environmental injustice through collaborations between the disability studies program and sustainability student organizations, according to event attendee and disability studies professor Libbie Rifkin. 
“I think that, among other things, there should be more collaboration between disability studies and climate justice initiatives on campus,” Rifkin said in an interview with The Hoya. “There’s great work to be done and I know a lot of students are really interested in climate change. I think it’s important to bring disability into the conversation.” 
Providing equitable access to education to marginalized and impoverished communities is crucial in improving accessibility, according to Erevelles.  
“Education should be a space where people are nurtured to be the best they can be on their terms, not on standards,” Erevelles said.

District of Columbia Public Schools is transferring the care and maintenance of Duke Ellington Field to the Department of Parks and Recreation, according to a Nov. 21 email from DPR Chief of External Affairs Tommie Jones obtained by The Hoya. 
In the midst of ongoing questions about the lack of public recreation space in Northwest Washington, D.C., DPR will hold a community meeting Nov. 25 at 6 p.m. at St. John’s Episcopal Georgetown Church at 3240 O St. NW to gauge the community’s needs for Ellington Field, according to Jones. 
The meeting will discuss the transfer process and answer questions, Jones wrote in the email to the Parent Teacher Organizations of Hardy Middle School, School Without Walls High School and Duke Ellington School of the Arts.
Ellington Field’s transfer allows DPR to expand its use, especially for local schools, according to a Nov. 14 email from DPR Director Delano Hunter to Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E obtained by The Hoya. 
“The activation of the Ellington Field will result in increased community access to this facility for their neighborhood recreational needs while simultaneously providing local schools, such as Duke Ellington School for the Arts, Hardy Middle School, and School Without Walls, with a location to host after-school athletic activities,” Hunter wrote. 
The transfer of the field, which is located on Reservoir Road between 38th and 39th streets, was first announced at a July meeting of ANC 2E, which represents Georgetown, Hillandale and Burleith, according to The Northwest Courier. Commissioners and community members expressed frustration at the lack of transparency in the process at the time, having first learned of the transfer during the meeting.
There are few public recreation fields in Northwest D.C. Jelleff Field, across the street from Hardy Middle School, has been the subject of controversy since August after DPR extended a 2009 contract granting the Maret School near-exclusive access to the field. 
Hardy does not have access to Jelleff Field during prime after-school hours due to the DPR deal with Maret, a private school in Ward 3. In exchange for field access, Maret will provide continued funding for field improvements and maintenance. The deal prompted outcry from local parents who argue that access to the public field should not be restricted.
Hunter was expected to testify at an Oct. 21 hearing on the Jelleff Field contract that creating a field at Duke Ellington would be a potential solution to the lack of space, according to The Washington Post.
Adjoining Jelleff Field is the Jelleff Recreation Center, which some community members say also requires changes to meet neighborhood needs. 
Renovations to the Jelleff Rec Center building are planned and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) has budgeted $7 million as of fiscal year 2020 intended to bring Jelleff Rec Center into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
Renovations to Jelleff Rec Center are long overdue, according to ANC 2E Commissioner Kishan Putta.
“There is not a single thing you can do in the building without climbing or descending stairs. It’s the least accessible building I’ve ever seen,” he said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s old, it’s inaccessible and it’s crying out for renovation and revitalization.”
However, there is concern about whether or not the budgeted funding will be enough. 
The city will not approve the next budget until June 2020, so no further money has been budgeted yet, according to Martin Welles (LAW ’09), vice president of the Parent Teacher Organization at Hardy Middle School.
“This is enough for refurbishment but not a full-scale renovation,” he wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Welles emphasized that the budgeting process should take into account the neighborhood’s specific needs for Jelleff.
“There’s a tremendous need for an indoor swimming pool that can serve competition swim teams and recreation,” he said in an interview with The Hoya. “Comprehensive planning needs to occur for the needs of the community.”
Over 400 local residents responded to a survey conducted by ANC 2E that gauged the community’s needs. The new recreation center will be developed and designed according to the community’s feedback, according to ANC 2E Commissioner Elizabeth Miller.“It was clear from the survey that we should be thinking more broadly about exercise, fitness, and community programming as a way to serve the most residents and make Jelleff as vibrant as possible,” Miller wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I look forward to a robust community engagement process on the renovation and how to make Jelleff Recreation Center the heartbeat of Georgetown and Burleith.”

A group leading the push for Washington, D.C., to hold a recall election for Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans (D) submitted 5,588 signatures in favor to the Board of Elections on Nov. 18.
Ward 2 Citizens Recall is a group of local residents campaigning for a special recall election that would ask Ward 2 voters whether or not to remove Evans from office, following numerous ethics complaints against the councilmember. 
The Board of Elections has 30 days to trigger a special election if it verifies that the petition was signed by 10% of registered Ward 2 voters. The petition needed 4,949 votes, according to the Oct. 15 voter registration total, and it exceeded this threshold. 
Ward 2 Citizens Recall described the reasons for its petition in a recall statement submitted to the Board of Elections April 12, citing the ongoing federal investigation into Evans’ numerous ethics violations, and began its petition campaign May 18. 
Nine of Evans’ 12 fellow councilmembers have called for his resignation after a third-party law firm released a report Nov. 4 detailing 11 ethics violations by Evans since 2014.
“While Councilmember Jack Evans has been asked to resign by most of his colleagues on the DC Council, it will be his constituents who have the final say,” Recall Campaign Chairman Adam Eidinger said in a Nov. 18 news release. 
The law firm O’Melveny and Myers independently investigated Evans on behalf of the council. Evans has been accused of corruption, specifically by using his council position to benefit the interests of clients of his consulting company since the spring of 2018. 
Six in 10 D.C. residents believe Evans should resign, according to a poll by The Washington Post. If voters remove Evans from office, he would be the first member of D.C. Council to be removed since the passage of the Home Rule Act in 1973.
Some Ward 2 constituents expressed opposition to Evans’ removal in a Nov. 19 letter on behalf of Evans entitled “The Jack We Know.” The over 20 Ward 2 signatories urge the D.C. Council not to remove Evans from office, claiming that doing so would rob residents of their elected voice, according to the letter. 
“What runs throughout Jack’s long service as a Councilmember is his commitment to the residents of Ward 2 and, indeed, the District of Columbia, whether responding to their needs and requests or foreseeing structural ways to create the environment for a vibrant economy serving the public good,” they wrote. 
Six Democrats are running to replace Evans, who has not yet declared a run for reelection. The candidates are Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners Patrick Kennedy, Kishan Putta and John Fanning; former Obama administration staffer Jordan Grossman; and political newcomers Daniel Hernandez, a former Marine, and Yilin Zhang, who is active in the League of Women Voters D.C. statehood campaign. 
Putta and Zhang worked over last weekend to help collect signatures in support of the petition, according to Ward 2 Citizens Recall. 
Grossman and Putta are among those who signed the petition. A recall vote is far overdue, according to Grossman.
“I signed the recall petition because it’s long past time for Jack Evans to be removed from office. Ward 2 deserves a councilmember focused on fighting for a more equitable and inclusive city, not selling his office to paying clients,” Grossman wrote, who plans to run in the special election if Evans is recalled.
Evans’ violations should not be excused, according to Putta, who said that he decided to give his support to the recall effort following the release of the D.C. Council report. Putta joined petition gatherers at the Wisconsin Avenue Safeway and collected several signatures in support of the recall, he said. 
“I agree fully that this is wrong and we deserve better. So after council report came out, I decided to join the recall effort in the last approximately two weeks,” Putta said. 
Ward 2 Democratic candidates Jordan Grossman and Kishan Putta received endorsements this week as the race for the seat grows more complex. 
Grossman received an endorsement from Jews United for Justice Campaign Fund, a campaign fund that helps educate D.C.’s Jewish community about local elections, Nov. 13.
D.C. for Democracy, a progressive grassroots organization that seeks to educate D.C. residents about campaigns, also held a meeting Nov. 14 to vote on their endorsement for the Ward 2 campaign. 
While Grossman received the majority vote, 54%, he did not meet the threshold necessary for endorsement, DC4D Operations Director Kesh Ladduwahetty explained. DC4D requires a vote of 67% support to give an endorsement. 
“We have left open the possibility of another vote in the future,” Ladduwahetty wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The endorsement from JUFJ and the support from DC4D are critical developments in the campaign, according to Grossman.
“Jews United for Justice (JUFJ) Campaign Fund and DC for Democracy members have made clear that our campaign to represent Ward 2 on the DC Council is the most progressive and the cleanest break from Jack Evans and his corrupt machine,” Grossman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Putta, a commissioner on Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, received an endorsement from former U.S. Surgeon General and Ward 2 resident Vivek Murthy on Nov. 14. Murthy served as former President Barack Obama’s surgeon general but was asked to resign by President Donald Trump in 2017.
Murthy’s endorsement validates the work he has done to campaign in the neighborhood, according to Putta.
“I have admired him for years, and it was a great honor, and we are very proud of it,” Putta said in an interview with The Hoya. “We believe, as he said, this is a validation of my hard work over the years to improve our city and our ward.”

Lauinger Library’s media equipment, currently located in the Gelardin New Media Center on the first floor of Lau, will relocate to the third-floor circulation desk in January 2020 to centralize the library’s resources and make the equipment more accessible, the library announced Nov. 14.
Faculty, students and staff can rent electronic equipment including cameras, audio recorders, Chromebooks and iPads from Gelardin. Georgetown community members checked out the media equipment a total of 19,500 times between July 2018 and June 2019, according to Beth Marhanka, head of Gelardin and the Maker Hub. 
Gelardin, which first opened in 2001, serves as the main resource for university members to use multimedia resources. Gelardin staff members are trained to help users choose equipment for various digital media projects and provide services like individual project consultations and workshops.
The equipment’s move to the third-floor circulation desk will streamline the process of utilizing resources for the campus community, Marhanka wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“The goal of moving the circulation of media equipment to the 3rd floor is to improve our users’ experience by enabling them to check out all Library items from a single circulation point on the entry-level and allowing patrons to access media equipment checkouts/returns for an additional 30 hours per week,” Marhanka wrote.
As a result of the move to the circulation desk, the media equipment will now be managed by the access services department of the library instead of Gelardin’s staff, according to Marhanka. The department manages material circulation like borrowing books within Georgetown University and the Washington Research Library Consortium, a partnership between nine universities in the Washington, D.C. area to improve students’ access to resources.
Lau is training circulation desk staff to ensure they will be able to consult access services employees about the media equipment once the move happens, according to the library’s announcement regarding the move. 
“Library staff members are currently training across departments in order to provide the best support possible for this change,” the library wrote in the Nov. 14 announcement. “Gelardin staff will continue to be available for instruction and consultation on the media equipment.”
Gelardin is open 66.5 hours per week, while the circulation desk is open 99.5 hours per week, according to the library’s fall 2019 schedule.
The relocation will free up members of the Gelardin media team to focus on helping students with media production using specialized software like Adobe Creative Suite and on expanding virtual reality programs in the center, according to Marhanka.
“We have several VR systems you can use to explore immersive apps where you can paint on a 360-degree canvas, travel anywhere in the world and feel like you are really in that location, or even experience the impact of climate change on the ocean floor,” Marhanka wrote. “Our whole philosophy is that when you give powerful tools to creative, smart people, the possibilities are endless.”
After using Gelardin’s services for personal projects, Marlee Turner (NHS ’20) began working at Gelardin’s first-floor equipment desk this semester to be a resource for others, she said.
“Personally I had started working here because I really liked the Gelardin New Media Center,” Turner said in an interview with The Hoya. “I liked to come down here and have these people here as a resource for using the equipment.”
While library staff in Gelardin began planning for the equipment’s move last summer, Turner said she was unsure why the library was proceeding with the move. Gelardin’s technology loan system has not been integrated into the circulation desk in the past because the center involves specialized equipment, according to Turner.
“I think it’s separate because these people really know how to use the equipment and they specialize in it,” Turner said. “When it’s upstairs it will be combined with normal library and I think it will be a harder transition. It’s kind of missing out a good part of the first floor because these people are here and they will help you and it’s kind of just like a creative space.”
The Gelardin team is devoting time to training staff rather than making final decisions about how to use the vacated space, according to Marhanka. 
“We’re still discussing what to do with the space being vacated when the equipment goes upstairs,” Marhanka wrote. “During the Spring 2020 semester we’ll be looking into all the options. Right now our focus is on training our student employees and making sure our users know about the upcoming changes.”
