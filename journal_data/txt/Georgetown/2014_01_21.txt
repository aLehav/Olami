A student walking near the 3500 block of O Street NW was robbed at gunpoint at about 1:45 a.m. Tuesday morning, according to the Georgetown University Police Department.
The victim reported that three individuals, all of whom were wearing darkly colored hooded sweatshirts, accosted the victim before proceeding to brandish a handgun and take his backpack. He was able to return to his residence after the occurrence. The university issued a HOYAlert at 2:48 a.m. informing students of the situation, which both GUPD and the Metropolitan Police Department responded to.
Students in Lauinger Library were advised to remain in place until the area had been cleared.
GUPD Chief of Police Jay Gruber advised students to continue to be conscious of their surroundings while walking about the neighborhood.
“When our students are out walking, it’s always better to walk in groups. If you see people who you’re uncomfortable with, you should cross the street and walk the opposite way,” Gruber said.
GUPD and MPD are continuing to investigate the situation.
