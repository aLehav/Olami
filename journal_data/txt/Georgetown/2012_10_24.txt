MTV will film a show on Georgetown’s campus that fields student questions for Barack Obama to coincide with the station’s live interview of the president Friday evening, according to an email announcement from the university distributed Wednesday.
“We believe this represents an opportunity to showcase the diversity and depth of opinions of our student body to a national audience, primarily of young people,” the email said. “And it represents a unique experience for our students to continue to engage in our political process as they make decisions about whom to support in the Presidential election.”
The email asked interested students to submit personal information and an issue of interest related to the election in order to be considered for the show. The filming will take place between 3 and 6 p.m. Friday.
According to the email, MTV considered several universities as a potential host for the show before selecting Georgetown.
