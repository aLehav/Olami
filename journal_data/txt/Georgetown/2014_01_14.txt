A routine election for GUSA senate speaker drew the ire of the GUSA Election Commission on Sunday, when GUSASenator Emily Siegler (SFS ’14) defeated Vice Speaker Sam Greco (SFS ’15) and two other candidates.
Greco had failed to receive a majority in a confirmation vote to rise from vice speaker to speaker, drawing 13 no’s, nine yes’s and two abstentions, leading to an immediate election for the new speaker.
The open election speaker vote was contested by Siegler, Greco, Senator Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16) and Senator Robert Shepherd (MSB ’15). Siegler received 10 votes and Shepherd received eight, while Greco and McNaughtonreceived three apiece, leading to their automatic elimination. The six votes were then redistributed toSiegler, leading to her final tally of 16 to Shepherd’s eight.
The confirmation vote and subsequent election were called after former speaker George Spyropoulos (COL ’14) resigned Dec. 8, and both come at a time when GUSAmembers are quietly mobilizing to begin campaigns for the executive slot in the coming weeks.
However, Section 2.05 of the GUSA bylaws states that the role of the vice speaker is to assume the role of speaker after the speaker resigns or is removed, and does not mention the necessity of a confirmation vote.
GUSA Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14), who presided over the meeting, emphasized that the confirmation vote, while not mentioned in the bylaws, is something that is upheld as precedent and took place last year with the transition from current GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) to former speaker Zach Singer (SFS ’15), who preceded Spyropoulos.
“My understanding is that the precedent was set over the past couple of years where there would be a confirmation vote. Last year for example, when Nate resigned, Zach succeeded Nate but was not confirmed until the confirmation vote by the entire GUSA senate,” Ramadan said.
Siegler, who commented during the meeting that oral traditions are just as legitimate as those written in constitutions, said she drew this insight from knowledge of legal procedures.
“My statement yesterday was that in court situations, legal precedents have been established in similar situations,” Siegler said. “I wasn’t saying that the confirmation vote should be held over the bylaws.”
“If people truly had a problem with this, I believe there were many appropriate times to speak those concerns, and it was rather silent on those fronts,” Senator Seamus Guerin (COL ’16) said.
Guerin said that a confirmation vote is an important indicator of how a new speaker will be received in the senate.
“The speaker serves all of the senate, and all of the senators individually, and to have their confidence and their confirmation is important. Their support is important for the success of the position,” Guerin said.
However, the Election Commission challenged the legitimacy of the procedure.
“The Election Commission was not formally involved in the administration of this election, nor do we fully endorse its validity,” GUSA Election Commissioner Ethan Chess (COL ’14) wrote in an email. “The GUSA bylaws state that the vice speaker becomes speaker upon the resignation of the outgoing speaker. There is fairly little grey area as far as that is concerned. While I recognize that in the past confirmation votes have been taken in this same circumstance, they were, by my reading of the bylaws, not necessary for the speaker to carry out his or her duties.”
If the procedure backed by Chess were to be followed, in order for Siegler to assume the speakership, Greco would have had to automatically assume the speakership, at which point the senate would have been required to remove him from that role, if so desired. Removal requires a unanimous vote of the Ways and Means Committee, as well as a subsequent two-thirds vote in the senate.
However, Chess said that this procedure would still bring up questions.
“To remove [Greco] from his position based on the results of a vote that would be ambiguous at best, and invalid at worst cannot be good for the health of elections throughout GUSA,” Chess wrote. “I suspect this issue will merit some consideration from the Constitutional Council going forward and they will — after careful deliberation — make a final [adjudication] on the matter.”
The confirmation vote that took place Sunday was unusual, according to Greco.
“That whole confirmation procedure, it took over an hour. Nothing like that has ever happened before,” Greco said. “In my experience, I’m almost 100 percent positive that the vice president last year didn’t come in when this happened. I know there was no questioning, debating, leaving the room. It was nothing to the degree that they proceeded with [Sunday] night. That was irregular.”
Despite the confusion, senators said they look forward to working with Siegler.
“I couldn’t be more excited. I think she’s fresh face, and a fresh face goes a long way. I think that having a fresh face and a valuable contributor in the GUSA Senate will be awesome in leadership, and I think that she presents many skills that would serve her excellently in leading us,” Senator Chris Fisk (COL ’17) said.
Greco will remain in his position as vice speaker.

A new Spanish and Portuguese Living Learning Community has entered its planning stage. Scheduled to start in the 2015-2016 academic year, the LLC marks Georgetown’s second Romance language-based community.
“The main goal of the floor is to give Spanish and Portuguese students a place to develop their language skills and understanding of different cultures,” proponent Caitriona Pagni (SFS ’16) said. “Real mastery of a language doesn’t occur in a classroom setting.”
The potential LLC would not only allow students to acquire language skills, but also would gain exposure to Spanish and Portuguese cultures, Pagni added.
With the help of the Spanish and Portuguese department and the Spanish and Portuguese Club, the Office of Residential Living and Pagni surveyed interest in the LLC.
The survey, sent out in November, resulted in 56 percent of the 88 responses as “probably interested” or “definitely interested.”
According to Pagni, a potential faculty advisor for the LLC with experience in Spanish and Portuguese is being sought out.
“His or her role would be to help guide the floor’s RA and residents when they plan floor events,” Pagni said.
Due to the strong student-led initiative and student interest for the LLC, the future of the floor appears strong.
“The department is very pleased that this is a student-led initiative,” Spanish and Portuguese Department Chair Gwen Kirkpatrick said. “Being student-initiated means that the formation of the community will be sensitive to student issues, not just issues that faculty might think are important. We hope that the department could be a source of support and continuity for the community over the long term.”
Kirkpatrick noted that students interested in becoming a part of community floor will not be limited to non-fluent speakers.
“Of course many students want to study abroad in Brazil and Portugal, as well as in Spanish-speaking countries. Spanish and Portuguese speakers who speak these languages as their first language may also be interested,” Kirkpatrick said.
For many students, the option to live on a Spanish and Portuguese LLC will enable them to find a close cultural community on campus.
“I’m Venezuelan, but I’ve never actually lived in a Spanish environment before. It’d be wonderful if I could be a part of this new community, so that I could find my roots. I think the Spanish and Portuguese LLC is a great idea, and I hope to make the most out of it myself,” Eduardo Morles (COL ‘17).
The specific location is yet to be determined, but it is expected to house 20 to 30 students. The French Living Learning Community, located in Copley Hall, is being used as a point of reference for the Spanish and Portuguese floor.
Created three years ago, the French Floor is regarded as successful in fostering an intimate environment where French and Francophone culture can be shared.
“We have learned a lot about what kinds of activities students enjoy doing, about how to create a sense of community among the students and about how to take advantage of all of the French and Francophone resources Washington, D.C. has to offer,” French Floor Advisor Anne O’Neil-Henry said.
The Spanish and Portuguese LLC additionally aims to engage diverse resources for the benefit of the LLC community.
“The theme of community activities will definitely be diversity,” Pagni said. “Part of the reason I fell in love with the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking world is that every country I visited has a distinct character and I hope residents of the LLC would constantly engage this diversity.”

Mayoral candidate and D.C. City Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) hasn’t always had the best relationship with Georgetown — most notably when he lobbied for 100 percent of the student body to live on campus during negotiations of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement — but as Evans vies to be D.C.’s next mayor, his tone has changed to one of cooperation and engagement with the District’s universities.
While Evans clashed with the university over the development of the campus plan, which eventually called for 90 percent of students to be housed on campus by 2025, he pointed to the final agreement as an example of how he would work with Georgetown if elected.
“I think considering how far apart [Georgetown] and I started on the 2010 Campus Plan, it was a good sign that we were able to come together and figure something out,” Evans said in an interview with The Hoya.
This language stands in stark contrast to the attitude Evans displayed toward Georgetown during early campus plan negotiations.
“Even if students who live off campus in our neighborhood are well behaved, it is too much of a strain on residents. When you have houses and tenants that are not well behaved, the burden becomes impossible,” Evans wrote in a Jan. 2011 op-ed in The Georgetowner.
Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), who authored a viewpoint in The Hoya last summer urging students to take a second look at Evans and his relationship with the university ahead of the mayoral race, said the episode showed Evans’ lack of concern for student voices in the debate over the university’s future.
“He never showed any sort of the same outreach to the university and especially not to the student body and groups that were really trying to get the students’ voice heard,” Tezel said. “In order to show that he’s an ally, Councilmember Evans needs to listen to all voices in the District.”
Now, as the mayoral campaign enters its formal stages following the Jan. 2 deadline to gather signatures for ballot access, Evans said he hopes to work as a partner with the city’s universities in accomplishing their mutual goals.
“As mayor, I would assign a liaison to be in charge of communicating with universities and surrounding communities. I think it is critical for us to reach out to students because they are our most valuable resource,” Evans said.
Evans also emphasized the role the D.C. government can take in providing employment and internship opportunity to university students.
“I would push for-credit internship and summer jobs programs to get people more involved in the community,” Evans said. “Students at Georgetown and other area universities demonstrate a real interest in social justice issues and helping out. I believe the city government can be a big resource to D.C. students who are looking for internships and need information on prospective employers citywide so that they can get work after graduation.”
Evans also told The Hoya that he believes the relationship he has built over the years with the university as well as with the residents of Georgetown will allow him to act as a mediator in any conflicts that arise.
“I think there has to be a good balance struck in any major decisions that get made that affect the community,” Evans said.
Tezel said he welcomes the idea of a more communicative mayor’s office and added that outreach to the university should be much greater than it has been in recent years.
“Showing that kind of commitment to reach out, not just in the context of a mayoral campaign, but for the actual day-to-day governing would be very much appreciated and is sorely needed,” Tezel said.

With the appointment of Cornelia “Nina” Pillard on Dec. 17, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Court now has three former Georgetown University faculty members on its bench.
Pillard, who was nominated by President Barack Obama in June joins Judges Laurence Silberman and Arthur Raymond Randolph, who are both former Georgetown faculty, on the D.C. Circuit. Silberman, who was an Adjunct Professor of Administrative Law from 1987 to 1994 and from 1997 to 1999, was appointed to the D.C. Circuit by President Ronald Reagan in 1985.
“I love teaching at Georgetown, just as I’m sure JudgePillard does,” Silberman, currently a distinguished visitor from the judiciary at Georgetown Law who teaches both administrative law and labor law, said. “The Law Center is very conveniently located, as it is in close proximity to many important courts. In my years as a member of the faculty… it has been a wonderful experience.”
In addition to his teaching, Silberman received a Lifetime Service Award in 2006 and a Distinguished Service Award in 2007 from the Georgetown chapter of the Federalist Society.
Ties between the Law Center and area judges stretch back to the school’s inception in 1870, according to Law Center Associate Dean Peter Byrne.
“We want to expose our students to people who are making legislative decisions that impact our lives. It’s a terrific opportunity for students, as they often act as interns for these judges and get school credit for it,” Byrne said. “It’s hard to imagine a better place to go to law school than in the heart of Washington D.C.”
Randolph, who was appointed in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush, taught at the Georgetown Law Center from 1974 to 1978, specializing in civil procedure and injunctions.
Before joining the circuit, Pillard was the faculty director of the Law Center’s Supreme Court Institute where she most recently taught the seminar “Corporate Responsibility for Workers in the Global Supply Chain.” In being appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Pillard joins one of the most prestigious courts in the nation, as an appointment to the D.C. Circuit is often considered a stepping-stone for appointment to the Supreme Court. Four of the nine justices on the Supreme Court are alumni of the D.C. Circuit, including Chief Justice John Roberts.
The Yale- and Harvard-educated Pillard joined the faculty at Georgetown Law in 1997 before becoming Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel. Pillard returned to Georgetown Law in 2000. She is the seventh woman to serve on the D.C. Circuit, and her arrival marked the first time women occupied five out of the 11 seats on its bench.
“Nina’s superb record as a leading Supreme Court advocate and legal scholar speaks for itself —she will make a remarkable appellate judge,” Georgetown Law Dean William M. Treanor said in a statement following Pillard’s confirmation in December. “Though we are sad to lose her, we are thrilled and proud to send her on to the D.C. Circuit, where the same traits that made her such a valuable asset on our campus will be put to use strengthening the pursuit of justice.”

Students with cars and those driving university vehicles for student groups may find themselves unexpectedly fined due to the Metropolitan Police Department’s recent activation of new traffic cameras throughout the District.
According to MPD Director of Communications Gwendolyn Crump, the cameras were placed strategically based on data generated by the MPD.
“The deployment locations for the automated traffic enforcement units were selected based on a variety of criteria, including sites with crashes and injuries, calls for service, high speed volume, near schools or in zones prohibited for use by certain commercial vehicles,” Crump wrote in an email.
The cameras, intended to combat aggressive driving, will monitor speed limit, red lights and stop signs and issue tickets through the mail. There are currently over 130 traffic cameras positioned across the District.
While there are no new cameras in the blocks surrounding Georgetown’s campus, DPS Chief of Police Jay Gruber expressed that the cameras would nevertheless have positive effects on the Georgetown neighborhood, including increasing driver and pedestrian safety.
“Although none of the cameras directly impact the campus, the new cameras will most likely reduce traffic crash injuries, pedestrian injuries and deaths, as well as facilitate a smoother commute for our community,” Gruber wrote in an email.
While several Georgetown groups regularly use university vehicles around the District, student drivers are responsible for paying any fines incurred while operating vehicles for their respective groups.
Jessie Silvis (COL ’16), a driver for D.C. Reads, said that she was not aware of the cameras but will now be more careful while driving.
“I’ll definitely have to take that into consideration because if we get a ticket with the [Center for Social Justice] vans that would reflect really negatively on the university and probably would cost us something,” Silvis said.
Although Silvis said she recognizes the possible repercussions of traffic camera tickets, she noted that the drivers in the program already drive safely.
“I’m not too concerned, because we usually are on smaller roads or on highways where the speed limits are high, so we usually have to follow the speed limit anyway,” she said. “We try to drive pretty safely, considering we have a van full of tutors or kids going back and forth from the schools, so hopefully most people aren’t breaking the speed limit.”
Financial and Administrative Officer for the CSJ Lauren McCoy said that the organization did not have an official statement on how the new cameras might affect groups.
While Georgetown Outdoor Education also uses vans for transport throughout the District, program director Kristoffer Nessler expressed confidence in student guides’ ability to follow traffic laws.
“It really won’t affect us because we don’t speed,” Nessler said.

Georgetown’s inaugural massive open online course “Globalization’s Winners and Losers: Challenges for Developed and Developing Countries,” successfully completed its seven week run in December, awarding nearly 6,000 certificates to students from all over the world and inspiring several real-world offshoots in countries like Kazakhstan.
The 14,000 active users of the course on analyzing the effects of globalization came from nearly 150 countries and each used the course for a different purpose, according to School of Foreign Service Associate Director of the Landegger Program in International Business Diplomacy Rosaelena O’Neil. According to Professor Theodore Moran, who taught the course, nearly half of the users completed the program.
“We know anecdotally from our discussion boards and surveys that some students were taking the course for professional development requirements in their jobs, some students were taking it for credit that their own institutions were giving them credit for … and others were wanting the certificate just for personal satisfaction,” O’Neil said.
To complete the course, students were required to watch class videos, complete readings and post on discussion boards on the online course platform edX, as well as complete assessments.
Emily Cheung, the lead TA for the course, acknowledged the immediate feedback the course gave students through discussion boards.
“I think when you open up a course of this size on a platform like edX that has such an active discussion board, I think feedback is given immediately for everything,” Cheung said.
Moran said that many students also used the forum to debate readings and bring up criticisms and suggestions for the course.
“They were not bashful about giving their own experiences and their own reactions,” he said.
A large production team and group of researchers worked alongside Georgetown professors throughout the summer to create the course, which had an initial budget of $100,000, not including videography.
“Like every new project, I suspect that the cost is going to be exponentially less for other MOOCs,” O’Neil said. “This particular team had a particular chemistry that worked amazingly well and allowed us to produce something that was inconceivable in a short period of time.”
According to Moran, the MOOC has inspired teachers globally to adapt the course to their respective classrooms.
“One professor in Kazakhstan and a couple professors in Africa have told me that they are going to use this course as the basis for a real, physical course that they are going to give at their institutions,” Moran said.
While Moran expressed that MOOCs would certainly help propel the future of education, he did not believe such online courses could ever be substituted for a physical Georgetown education.
“This will never replace a Georgetown education,” Moran said. “There’s a reason why you’re paying, but this is part of the Jesuit outreach ethic of trying to go outside the walls of the university and offer service to the world.”
The MOOC team has already begun work on a reiteration of the course that is speculated to begin in the fall of next year, according to O’Neil.
The university will unveil its second MOOC course, “Introduction to Bioethics,” in April 2014.

Amid celebrations surrounding the recent D.C. Council provision for a higher minimum wage, concerns remain surrounding implementation of the new policy as some students fret that a higher minimum wage will limit the availability of full- and part-time jobs off campus.
The measure to increase the minimum wage would give the District and the neighboring Maryland suburbs of Montgomery and Prince George’s counties one of the highest minimum wages in the nation. The change would also index the wage for inflation beyond 2016.
The proposed change, which would raise the minimum wage to $11.50 from $8.25 per hour beginning in 2016, is now in the hands of Mayor Vincent Gray, who is expected to sign the bill later this month. While Gray has previously supported a more modest increase to $10 per hour, the D.C. Council’s unanimous approval means it could likely override any possible mayoral veto.
Any changes would immediately affect Georgetown and those employed by the university, according to University Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh.
“Georgetown abides by D.C. laws and will pay new minimum wages set in the District of Columbia,” Pugh wrote in an email. “We are thoughtfully working to integrate these changes into departmental budgets in the coming years.”
The university has already begun working to ensure that the wage increase, despite impacting department budgets, does not pose a negative effect on student employees, according to Associate Director of Student Employment Programs Jessica Witczak.
“Part-time employment is essential to many students in order to earn money to put [toward] the cost of attendance,” Witzcak wrote in an email. “We are cognizant that this change will impact the budget of many departments throughout the university which, in turn, has the ability to impact the number of available student positions and number of hours provided.”
According to Witzcak, the university currently pays undergraduate employees between $8.25 and $12.00 per hour depending on the position.
For students working off campus, there is concern that the wage increase could cause employers to either decrease hours or lower the number of employees to help offset the cost.
Cathy Eastman, assistant store manager for Anthropologie on M Street, which employs several student employees, does not see this negative outlook as a possibility.
“Our business is set up where it’s our payroll versus our sales, so of course we would have to arrange the business [so that] we could offset some of the impacts of the new minimum wage,” Eastman said.
Still, Eastman looked favorably on a higher minimum wage for her employees.
“The increase is good for us, but we’ve always paid competitively — a little bit more than other brands,” Eastman said. “It’s always a great thing for people to feel like they’re getting paid their worth.”
The change also has the potential to negatively affect part-time employees, who are more likely to earn a lower hourly wage than their full-time counterparts.
“I think raising the minimum wage is a great idea, but I think it will hurt student employment,” Scott Harrington (SFS ’16), who works at North Face on M Street, said. “I believe that the higher wages will cause employers to focus on investing in their current workers as much as possible.”
Despite the general approval of the proposed increase, the signed bill notably lacked a provision to raise the wages of tipped restaurant workers, who currently earn a minimum wage of $2.77 before tips.
“For college students, I don’t think it really matters much,” Dylan Leone (SFS ’17), who works as a student guard on campus, said. “It’s the minimum-wage workers in the city who are below the poverty line [who] are going to be affected. They need this minimum wage increase to keep a basic standard of living in the city.”

A nationwide debate about paid and unpaid internships continues amid the flurry of networking events and resume workshops that signal the approach of internship application season, forcing students to take stock of their future employment prospects.
Internships held by Georgetown students are abundant. Ninety percent of graduating seniors have reportedly held at least one internship during their time on campus with 75 percent of those reporting having held a paid position, according to the university’s Senior Survey data.
A recent study published by the Society for Human Resource Management analyzed the increased availability of internships to students.
According to the survey, which took a sample of some 3,000 U.S. organizations, 34 percent of organizations offered more internships during 2013 than 2012.
“It is positive that organizations have hired interns,” SHRM’s Survey Research Center Manager Semiha Evren Esen said. “And most have hired two to five interns, which shows that they have an internship program in place.”
The survey also reported favorable prospects for paid internships: more than 75 percent of respondents reported that they paid their interns.
However, the internship culture still has a long way to go according to Eric Glatt (LAW ’15), who sued Fox Searchlight Pictures in September 2011 for undercompensating his unpaid work as a production intern on the set of “Black Swan.”
“I don’t think that study is really all that significant. It’s great to talk about members of that organization, but I don’t think the survey says a lot about the profile of unpaid internships in general,” Glatt said.
Glatt, who won his case against Fox Searchlight Pictures, believes that organizations are using interns to do jobs that should be held by paid employees.
“[Organizations have] learned that by merely adding that job title and adding that description to an ad for a job, they suddenly don’t have to pay for the labor they need performed,” Glatt said.
According to Cawley Career Education Center Executive Director Dr. Mike Schaub, Glatt’s sentiments reflect national trends in the way interns are being treated by employers.
“I believe that the culture surrounding students’ and employers’ expectations of the internship experience is changing and that employers are beginning to see the importance of compensating their interns appropriately,” Schaub said.
However, not all students agree with Glatt’s sentiments. Neil Noronha (SFS ’14), who has held unpaid internships at the White House, U.S. Treasury, U.S. State Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as a paid internship at Goldman Sachs, said there is value in unpaid internships.
“If you can get paid, great, but an unpaid internship with higher brand quality may offer more future job opportunities than a smaller brand but paid internship,” Noronha said.
While different opinions abound, Glatt has confidence that the national conversation surrounding interns’ compensation could set a precedent that will eliminate unpaid internships.
“When we filed the lawsuit, I would say more than half of the initial reaction was actually ridicule,” Glatt said. “Since that time, this country has opened up a dialogue about inequality, about exclusion and about structural problems in the economy.”

The first official debate of D.C.’s mayoral race kicked off Thursday night with seven of the mayoral candidates appearing in front of an audience of over 200 at the Dumbarton House in Georgetown.
The debate, which focused largely on the future of economic development, public transportation, education and affordable housing in the District, was co-sponsored by the Citizens Association of Georgetown and Georgetown Business Association.
While Mayor Vincent Gray cancelled his appearance at the debate due to a “pressing public security situation,” according to the moderator Davis Kennedy, editor and publisher of The Current Newspapers, the candidates present included Councilmembers Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Vincent Orange (D-At Large) and Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), as well as restaurateur Andy Shallal and former State Department official Reta Jo Lewis.
Ten minutes into the debate local businessman and little-known mayoral candidate Christian Carter arrived. Carter, whose campaign platform includes raising pay for D.C. public school teachers and tightening hiring standards for residents, had not been formally invited to participate in the debate.
“I’m a mayoral candidate, some of the media … that work with these candidates have been trying to block me off of the scene … but I’m not going to allow that to happen,” Carter said.
Despite initial protests from Kennedy, and amid shouts of “Let him speak!” from audience members, Carter was finally allowed to participate.
Candidates addressed the potential impact of a Metro stop in the Georgetown neighborhood. Shallalwas skeptical of the stop’s purpose and focused on the potential problems in the building process.
“I’m not sure it’s worth the time, effort and money it’s going to require,” Shallal said.
Wells, who supports the proposed stop, outlined the need for additional transportation options in improving residents’ access to all parts of the District.
“The reason that you have to have a great transit system is because it doesn’t matter if you get a job in Georgetown if you can’t get to it,” Wells said.
Candidates responded to questions regarding the Large Retailer Accountability Act as well, which would have raised the minimum wage on large national chains in the District.
The candidates were split in their support for the bill, which came up shortly after retail giant Wal-Mart announced it would build a store in the District.
Wells said the bill did not tackle the problem of providing a living wage aggressively enough.
“What I promised I would do after I voted against that bill was to do something real and that is to raise the minimum wage for all low-wage workers,” Wells said.
Evans supported the bill, but said raising the overall minimum wage, not just the minimum wage for workers at large retailers, was the more important issue at hand.
Orange talked about the necessity of bringing economic development to all areas of the District and taking advantage of the revenue generated by the city’s recent growth.
“Businesses are here generating revenue. The question is, do you want to lower those taxes, and at the same time east of the river suffers?” Orange said, referring to the level of poverty in Wards 7 and 8.
In her remarks, Lewis touched on the city’s current struggle to provide affordable housing to all of its residents.
“Residents of the District of Columbia do not want to have to chose between whether or not they want to have a house or send their kids to school. They have to have a choice, and they just want the city to be a partner with them,” Lewis said.
Bowser emphasized the need for a more efficient allocation of resources to improve the D.C. public school system.
“If we can build successful schools in Ward 8, Ward 6, we won’t have the strain in Ward 3,” Bowser said.
Candidates will face off again when American University, in collaboration with the Kennedy Political Union, holds a formal debate Feb. 12.

A routine election for GUSA senate speaker drew the ire of the GUSA Election Commission on Sunday, when GUSASenator Emily Siegler (SFS ’14) defeated Vice Speaker Sam Greco (SFS ’15) and two other candidates.
Greco had failed to receive a majority in a confirmation vote to rise from vice speaker to speaker, drawing 13 no’s, nine yes’s and two abstentions, leading to an immediate election for the new speaker.
The open election speaker vote was contested by Siegler, Greco, Senator Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16) and Senator Robert Shepherd (MSB ’15). Siegler received 10 votes and Shepherd received eight, while Greco and McNaughtonreceived three apiece, leading to their automatic elimination. The six votes were then redistributed toSiegler, leading to her final tally of 16 to Shepherd’s eight.
The confirmation vote and subsequent election were called after former speaker George Spyropoulos (COL ’14) resigned Dec. 8, and both come at a time when GUSAmembers are quietly mobilizing to begin campaigns for the executive slot in the coming weeks.
However, Section 2.05 of the GUSA bylaws states that the role of the vice speaker is to assume the role of speaker after the speaker resigns or is removed, and does not mention the necessity of a confirmation vote.
GUSA Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14), who presided over the meeting, emphasized that the confirmation vote, while not mentioned in the bylaws, is something that is upheld as precedent and took place last year with the transition from current GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) to former speaker Zach Singer (SFS ’15), who preceded Spyropoulos.
“My understanding is that the precedent was set over the past couple of years where there would be a confirmation vote. Last year for example, when Nate resigned, Zach succeeded Nate but was not confirmed until the confirmation vote by the entire GUSA senate,” Ramadan said.
Siegler, who commented during the meeting that oral traditions are just as legitimate as those written in constitutions, said she drew this insight from knowledge of legal procedures.
“My statement yesterday was that in court situations, legal precedents have been established in similar situations,” Siegler said. “I wasn’t saying that the confirmation vote should be held over the bylaws.”
“If people truly had a problem with this, I believe there were many appropriate times to speak those concerns, and it was rather silent on those fronts,” Senator Seamus Guerin (COL ’16) said.
Guerin said that a confirmation vote is an important indicator of how a new speaker will be received in the senate.
“The speaker serves all of the senate, and all of the senators individually, and to have their confidence and their confirmation is important. Their support is important for the success of the position,” Guerin said.
However, the Election Commission challenged the legitimacy of the procedure.
“The Election Commission was not formally involved in the administration of this election, nor do we fully endorse its validity,” GUSA Election Commissioner Ethan Chess (COL ’14) wrote in an email. “The GUSA bylaws state that the vice speaker becomes speaker upon the resignation of the outgoing speaker. There is fairly little grey area as far as that is concerned. While I recognize that in the past confirmation votes have been taken in this same circumstance, they were, by my reading of the bylaws, not necessary for the speaker to carry out his or her duties.”
If the procedure backed by Chess were to be followed, in order for Siegler to assume the speakership, Greco would have had to automatically assume the speakership, at which point the senate would have been required to remove him from that role, if so desired. Removal requires a unanimous vote of the Ways and Means Committee, as well as a subsequent two-thirds vote in the senate.
However, Chess said that this procedure would still bring up questions.
“To remove [Greco] from his position based on the results of a vote that would be ambiguous at best, and invalid at worst cannot be good for the health of elections throughout GUSA,” Chess wrote. “I suspect this issue will merit some consideration from the Constitutional Council going forward and they will — after careful deliberation — make a final [adjudication] on the matter.”
The confirmation vote that took place Sunday was unusual, according to Greco.
“That whole confirmation procedure, it took over an hour. Nothing like that has ever happened before,” Greco said. “In my experience, I’m almost 100 percent positive that the vice president last year didn’t come in when this happened. I know there was no questioning, debating, leaving the room. It was nothing to the degree that they proceeded with [Sunday] night. That was irregular.”
Despite the confusion, senators said they look forward to working with Siegler.
“I couldn’t be more excited. I think she’s fresh face, and a fresh face goes a long way. I think that having a fresh face and a valuable contributor in the GUSA Senate will be awesome in leadership, and I think that she presents many skills that would serve her excellently in leading us,” Senator Chris Fisk (COL ’17) said.
Greco will remain in his position as vice speaker.

Since School of Foreign Service adjunct professor Michael Scheuer appeared to endorse the assassinations of President Barack Obama and U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron in a column Dec. 23, he has been the subject of media attention and criticism. Yet in an interview with The Hoya, Scheuer did not back down from the comments that angered Americans across the political spectrum.
The crux of the media uproar focuses on the column’s close, which advises Obama and Cameron to pay heed to the writings of 17th century English republican Algernon Sidney, who called for the execution of tyrants and glorification of their assassins.
“There must therefore be a right of proceeding judicially or extra-judicially against all persons who transgress the laws; or else those laws, and the societies that should subsist by them, cannot stand; and the ends for which governments are constituted, together with the governments themselves, must be overthrown,” wrote Sidney, who was executed for treason against King Charles II and whose writings later served as inspiration for American revolutionaries.
The Sidney passage comes at the end of the column, which labels Obama and Cameron as “the Islamists’ only indispensable allies,” describes a growing religious war and criticizes the two politicians for their approaches.
In an interview with The Hoya, Scheuer said this criticism could be applied to any Western leader.
“Obama, Mrs. Clinton, Bush, Cheney, all of them tell the because [Islamists] hate how we live. They don’t. They don’t hate the American people, what they do is hate the American government for what it does in their world,” Scheuer said. “Until we realize that as fact, this war — we’re going to keep losing it as we are now.”
Scheuer said that if electoral options failed to remove egregiously erring leaders, the people of a republic have a right to pursue other options, including protests, refusing to pay taxes and as a last resort, revolution. Scheuer, in this vein, refused to shy away from endorsing assassination.
“At some point, when push comes to shove, you kill people and get them out of the way,” Scheuer said. “But it’s the end of a very long process, and one would hope that supposedly smart men who went to Harvard and Oxford would know that the future is not a happy one for them if they continue to disregard the liberties their people have fought for over centuries.”
Scheuer’s column, published on his website, non-intervention.com, focused on the partnership between the United States and the United Kingdom as well as the countries’ wartime policies. Scheuer, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who was the former head of the agency’s Osama bin Laden unit, criticized the leaders for their policies regarding the Muslim world, including their support of Tahrir Square activists during the Arab Spring.
The column quickly received traction on news websites, most prominently on The Daily Beast, where columnist David Frum described Scheuer’s comments as “advocacy of murder,” in a column entitled“Michael Scheuer’s Meltdown.”
Scheuer has received criticism from liberal and conservative quarters alike.
“I’ve offended everyone. It comes from leftist websites because they think Obama really is the second coming of Christ, and it comes from the conservative websites because conservatives would love to have me on their team except I don’t want unnecessary wars and I can’t stand the American relationship with Israel,” Scheuer said. He emphasized that his desire to extricate the United States from its relationship with its Middle East ally is not synonymous with anti-Semitism.
Scheuer, who since 2005 has taught two graduate-level courses, “Al Qaeda” and “Al Qaeda and the Global Jihad” for the Security Studies Program during both summer and fall semesters, said he has never been approached by the university regarding his outside writings, which have been the subject of past controversy. Although his critics have written to the administration in protest, according to Scheuer, Center for Security Studies Director Bruce Hoffman has defended him before, calling him the leading scholar on Osama bin Laden. The Center for Security Studies declined to comment for this article through Associate Director David Maxwell, citing Scheuer’s status as a private citizen and lack of a spring 2014 course at Georgetown.
Scheuer did say he expected to hear from the university on this occasion, although he has not yet heard anything.
University spokeswoman Stacy Kerr said that the university was not in the practice of censoring opinion.
“This is the essence of academic freedom. Being committed to the free and open exchange of ideas does not mean that we approve of or endorse each and every statement made by members of our faculty,” Kerr wrote in an email. “The answer to speech that one finds disagreeable or controversial is not censorship but more speech and more dialogue. As such, we welcome everyone’s right to disagree and to express their opinions openly.”

In a move that comes after national trends of grade inflation, Georgetown introduced two academic changes this semester: academic transcripts that display the mean grade in each course in addition to an individual student’s grade and Latin honors calculated by percentages rather than GPA cutoffs beginning with the Class of 2017.
In the Class of 2013, 38.5 percent of seniors in the McDonough School of Business, 56.3 percent in Georgetown College, 58.8 percent in the School of Nursing and Health Studies and 64.36 percent in the School of Foreign Service graduated with Latin honors.
In the new system, which will affect current freshmen onward, the top 5 percent of a graduating class will receive summa cum laude designation, the next 10 percent will graduate magna cum laude and the next 10 percent will graduate cum laude, for a total of 25 percent of students in each undergraduate school graduating with honors — 13.5 percent less than graduated with honors last year in theMSB, which grants the distinction to the fewest graduates. In the SFS, for example, these changes will lead to a nearly 40 percent decrease in students graduating with honors.
These honors designations will be calculated based on percentiles of GPA distribution of the previous graduating class.
Currently, graduating summa cum laude requires a GPA of 3.9, while a GPA of 3.7 is needed to graduate magna cum laude and a 3.5 GPA earns cum laude honors.
Based on data from the Class of 2013, under the percentage system, graduating summa cum laude would remain relatively stable, requiring a GPA of 3.902 in the College, 3.928 in the NHS, 3.904 in theSFS and 3.835 in the MSB. The standards to graduate magna cum laude would rise from 3.7 across all schools to a GPA of 3.796 in the College, 3.803 in the NHS, 3.806 in the SFS and 3.713 in theMSB. Cum laude graduates would be the most drastically affected, with the lowest level of Latin honors requiring a 3.728 in the College, a 3.736 in the NHS, a 3.730 in the SFS and a 3.614 in theMSB compared to the standard 3.5.
Due to the curve already in place in the business school, which limits the number of students who may receive certain grades, MSB students would be the least affected by this change.
Current freshmen had varied reactions to the policy, which was not released in a campus-wide email but is available on each school’s undergraduate bulletin.
“Changing these policies is creating a lot of tension among students,” Greta Hagedorn (COL ’17) said. “That makes people think more about grades, when we should be focused on learning, not grades.”
Katie Harper (SFS ’17) concurred, believing that the change will not benefit the freshman class.
“I think it’s worse, because it creates a more competitive atmosphere and kids will feel like they need to continue to get higher and higher grades, because it’s based off the performance of other students.”
Vincent DeLaurentis (SFS ’17) pointed out that students were not consulted in the change.
“Even if we didn’t have any decision-making authority, I think discussion would have been helpful,” he said, adding that he did not think the change in the Latin honors policy was unfair, but wished that the designation would not be based on a comparison to another class.
The changes to academic transcripts to include mean course grades this semester, meanwhile, will affect students beyond the freshman class. The decision to add mean grades to transcripts stemmed from a 2008 resolution by the Main Campus Executive Faculty, a legislative body that determines academic policy, that came after a 2007 report on intellectual life. Though the 2008 resolution was never implemented, a version of the proposal was passed by the MCEF in March 2013, leading to this semester’s change, according to MCEF Chair and economics professor Ian Gale.
Data on mean grades became available on MyAccess Jan. 6, though an option to display a version of a transcript without mean grades will remain available. Mean grades are only included for classes taken beginning in fall 2013.
“The faculty is attuned to struggles with grade inflation at other institutions, and we wanted to implement an alternative transcript that provides a clearer idea of student performance. An A in a course with a mean grade of 3.5 should be seen differently than an A in a class with a 2.5 class average,” University Registrar and Assistant Provost John Q. Pierce said.
A compilation of 175 fall 2013 courses spanning all four schools found that for the vast majority of the classes, the mean grade was a B+ or A-. However, for some notoriously difficult courses such as “Management Science” in the MSB, mean grades in one section dropped to as low as a B-, at 2.647. For other courses, such as “Introduction to Cultural Studies,” the mean grade was an A, at 3.845.
The option of displaying mean grades as a method of combating — or making transparent — grade inflation stands in contrast to steps toward grade deflation taken by other universities. Princeton University adopted a policy of grade deflation in 2004, limiting grades in the A range to 35 percent of undergraduate courses — a guideline brought for re-evaluation by a Princeton faculty committee in October.
Though the move to display mean grades on transcripts will not affect actual grading, some professors are worried that the option will prove detrimental to academic camaraderie and teamwork, as students are now in more direct competition with their peers.
“I’m a strong believer that a student’s grades should not depend on other students. I get a bit leery that there might be pressure to curve the grades, which I think distorts the academic system,” Erick Langer, director of the Master of Arts in Latin American Studies, said.
In the Master of Science in Foreign Service program at Georgetown, curves have been implemented, with whatLanger considers to be negative results.
“I’m very much opposed to the grading system in the MSFS. Now students don’t want to share their information anymore,” Langer said. “I find it to be against the spirit of true intellectualism, which requires students to not only gain knowledge, but to disseminate it to their peers so that everyone learns. Otherwise, we lose the teamwork ingredient that is so important in both government and private-sector work. School, especially at a Jesuit university, should not be a dog-eat-dog experience.”
However, some students feel that the introduction of mean grades will bring parity to larger courses.
“I think it’s good, especially in a class with a lot of [teaching assistants], like some of the bigger classes. It helps TAs realize what they might need to work on, how to best get the class all on the same page,” Samin Rai (MSB ’17) said. “For instance, if one TA had a lot higher mean grade than another, they would be able to figure out something to get them all more on the same page.”

Inspired by the dialogue of the #BBGU campaign, Georgetown students provided personal experiences, thoughts and questions about their life at Georgetown University as students of color through the #BLGU and #BAGU campaigns. The former, on Dec. 12, focused on issues related to Georgetown’s Latino community, while the latter, on Dec. 16, highlighted the Asian and Pacific Islander communities.
“Taking time out of your studies to tweet because you want your voice to be heard @BLGU_ #BLGU #BLGU_” —Viviana Jaramillo Balbin (MSB ’15)
Organizers of both #BAGU and #BLGU were motivated by recent dialogues and took to social media. Both events utilized sites such as Facebook and Twitter to spread awareness of the events and personal experiences of participants. #BAGU coincidentally followed the popular #NotYourAsianSidekick, started the day before, which helped to publicize the event.
#BLGU additionally reached out to the community using social media to promote the event.
“Our hopes were manifold: Raise awareness amongst students, faculty, administrators and alumni with regards to the Latina/o experience; create solidarity in the Latina/o community; attain recognition by administrators, that they pay attention to the concerns of the Latina/o community,” #BLGU organizer Kevin Magana (COL ’14) wrote in an email. He also mentioned attracting the alumni community and inspiring peer institutions to create similar events.
Using social media as a medium for the events additionally allowed participants to build off each other’s experiences.
“Though the event was simply tweeting and posting about the experiences of being in a specific minority group, I think it really helped members from different communities to realize that we all have common threads,” Vietnamese Student Association President Anthony Do (NHS ’15), who organized #BAGU, said.
Participants felt that the online nature of the event allowed them to comfortably post their thoughts.
“We’re using these hashtag campaigns because we don’t feel there’s a … space on campus where we can engage in this type of dialogue and be honest about it” Aya Waller-Bey (COL ’14), who orchestrated the #BBGU, said.
“Didn’t really notice the color of my skin or how thin my wallet is until I came here to @Georgetown. #BAGU” —Anthony Do (NHS ’15)
Students tweeted and posted about personal experiences, both positive and negative, relating to their race in the Georgetown community.
“In terms of content, the inspiration simply came from personal experiences. The APIA community is often associated with being the ‘model minority.’ Along with that, people often believe that we are not marginalized and do not experience disparities,” Do wrote in an email.
Through these online protests, Georgetown students have taken the initiative to spread awareness about their cause and to start a necessary conversation about diversity.
“I would love for everyone who feels like their identity has yet to be represented to do [something similar]. The reason why all this has happened in such quick succession is people are motivated for change and that this is a conversation that should be had now,” Claytia Gonsalves (SFS ’15), who helped Waller-Bey with publicizing #BBGU, said.
“‘Why are you hashtagging BAGU? Indians aren’t Asian.’ Thanks, but we’ll decide what we are and aren’t. #BAGU” —Prayuj Pushkarna (SFS ’17)
The #BAGU Twitter feed also addressed the controversial topic of what it means exactly for a person to consider him or herself Asian.
“I think the fact that we’re all in one label of ‘Asian,’ what happens is it makes certain groups invisible. A lot of it applies more to East Asians, whereas I am Vietnamese and identify as Southeast Asian Vietnamese American,” Linh Tran (COL ’15), a member of the VSA and East Coast Asian American Student Union, said. “Our history is based on immigration … so it sort of sets us different from other groups within the Asian community. I think it’s important because no one knows about it.”
“Bleeding #hoya blue, but also #BLGU_ #BLGU” —Sarah Audelo (SFS ’06)
Participants in both events hope #BLGU and #BAGU will help spread awareness among both the student body and the administration for these student concerns about diversity.
“A long-term goal was to catch the attention of the university and show them that these issues are important. I love Georgetown, I bleed Hoya Blue, and I will be proud to hold a Georgetown degree,” Do wrote. “I really want to see Georgetown as a whole practice Cura Personalis and be inclusive as a whole. I always wondered why Georgetown does not have an Ethnic Studies Program, so maybe these movements could raise it to their attention.”
The students organizing the protests stressed that these online protests should not be interpreted as an outlet to express negative feelings toward Georgetown. Rather, their aim is to improve the school they already love.
“The word ‘protest’ warrants a very negative type of opinion and people think we’re just criticizing and complaining and that we don’t love Georgetown, but there’s so much pride. … These protest and initiatives and campaigns are coming from a place of love for Georgetown,” Waller-Bey said.
“These are important voices #BLGU. We are listening. Keep the conversation going. @Georgetown” —Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J.
The conversations about diversity will not end after these Twitter protests. The organizers from #BBGU, #BLGU and #BAGU are still in communication to plan future events and action for the spring semester.
“Using the stories shared from these movements, as well as information that several other students have compiled, the goal is to create a formal proposal to push for some changes to be made on campus,” Do said. “Of course, the dialogue from these movements will continue. Some participants have been talking about starting blogs to continue the dialogue and keep the conversation going.”
Waller-Bey hopes that the different race and ethnicity-based Twitter protests can unite over common themes and goals in order to form a joint committee. Still in its early stages, the committee is entirely student-driven and will include the black, Hispanic and Asian communities as well as white allies.
“We’re currently looking for themes that were expressed in both the #BBGU thing, the #BLGU thing, and we’re hoping to do the same for #BAGU to from those types of experiences that we saw, be able to consolidate those and express more efficiently how we can solve those, what the university can do on their end, what we’re suggesting the university be doing and then propose different solutions in that manner,” Waller-Bey said.
The committee plans to meet early in 2014 to draft a proposal for the university.
“The conclusion to be drawn is that GU administrators need to act to make Georgetown a more inclusive place for its Latina/o community, as well as other minority groups. To overlook this would be to unnecessarily inflame passions and cause further efforts to gain attention towards these issues,” Magana wrote.

Students tweeted about their experiences of being disabled at Georgetown on Monday using the hashtag #BDGU. The protest — inspired by the December #BLGU, #BAGU and #BBGU Twitter protests by minority groups — lamented that Georgetown is far from being disability friendly.
Organized by Lydia Brown (COL ’15) along with Natalia Mabel Rivera-Morales (SFS ’13), Chris DeLorenzo (GRD ’17) and Carly Rosenfield (COL ’14), the online protest exposed viewers to the discrimination students with disabilities face from the administration and their peers, as well as positive experiences of support.
According to Brown, the Twitter event was intended to increase awareness and acceptance of disabled students on campus.
“I’m hoping that joining this conversation will emphasize the need for institutional commitment to disability and diversity while simultaneously bringing to light the experiences of disabled students who, before now, have very, very rarely been able to share what it means to be disabled at Georgetown,” Brown said.
#BDGU additionally focused on attracting greater university recognition of disability.
“It’s just particularly telling to me, because the university talks a lot about diversity,” Brown said. “Disability is usually included in lists of diversities but very rarely acknowledged and certainly not acknowledged at the same level that some other forms of diversity are.”
Brown said that in her opinion, Georgetown is not a disability-friendly school.
“Absolutely horrible comments that people receive from their peers, from their neighbors, from professors in classes … make it very adamantly clear for me that people with disabilities, especially non-apparent disabilities don’t feel safe, let alone included, at this university,” she said.
The participants of the Twitter protest tweeted about the disrespect and ableism present in the Georgetown community.
“Access and inclusion for disabled students shouldn’t be optional or above and beyond. It should be the bare minimal standard,” Brown tweeted.
“Learning that a professor can deny you an accommodation if it ostensibly ‘compromises the objectives of the course,’” Rivera tweeted.
“Say ‘n*****’ or ‘f****’ and you could get expelled or fired. Say ‘r*****’ and no one bats an eye,” DeLorenzo tweeted.
“I tell people that I’m autistic, and they say, ‘Don’t put yourself down like that; you’re so smart.’ I can’t be smart and disabled?” Brown tweeted.
“Having CAPS outright tell you, ‘we don’t deal with your kind here,’” tweeted DeLorenzo.
The need for the existence of a disability cultural center was mentioned by Brown to President John J. DeGioia at a public forum; however, the idea has not been met with a response.
“The only time you ever see anyone on campus talking about a disability, 99 [percent] of the time, it’s either something that should be hidden or kept secret because there’s some kind of stigma attached to it,” Brown said.
According to Brown, the role of such a cultural center would be to promote conversation, awareness and acceptance of an area of diversity that is often neglected.
“Essentially, a DCC’s role on campus would be very multi-faceted, but its significance can’t be underscored because the establishment of the DCC essentially is the institutional recognition and affirmation of the disability community and an integral part of our campus diversity,” Brown said.
Disability cultural centers already exist at the University of Minnesota, the University of Washington-Seattle and Syracuse University.
The majority of the tweets utilizing #BDGU were from Brown, DeLorenzo, Rivera and Rosenfield, although the conversation attracted a few Twitter users from outside of the Georgetown community.
“Interested to follow #BDGU today. Being disabled at Gtown an issue I didn’t think enough about until after grad, working at Special Olympics,” Gina Elliott (SFS ’12) tweeted.
As with the other Twitter campaigns, Director of Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr tweeted her support.
“Pay attention to #BDGU today, #Hoyas. Disabilities often get short shrift in conversations on diversity. Share your thoughts,” Cohen Derr tweeted.
“I would have liked it to be broader,” DeLorenzo said, but he added, “I’d say it’s a fruitful start.”

In response to the American Studies Association’s decision to endorse an academic boycott of Israeli institutions, Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia issued a statement Dec. 23 rejecting the ban and vowing to maintain standards of open dialogue and academic freedom.
DeGioia’s press release emphasized a commitment to free expression and the exchange of ideas, which he believes are central to the university’s mission.
“The recent resolution of the American Studies Association endorsing a boycott of Israeli universities undermines the academic freedom that is essential to the mission of the Academy,” the statement read. “As an academic institution, it is Georgetown’s responsibility to deepen engagement and fosterdialogue between scholars and societies to enhance the entire global academic community.”
The original ASA petition cited Israeli human rights abuses in the Palestinian territories, among other violations of international law, as justification for the boycott.
“The resolution is in solidarity with scholars and students deprived of their academic freedom, and it aspires to enlarge that freedom for all, including Palestinians,” the ASA’s letter endorsing the ban stated.
The site reported that over 66 percent of ASA members supported the organization’s decision in a nationwide vote.
Even though Georgetown is not endorsing the boycott, certain members of Georgetown’s faculty are members of the ASA and have publicly expressed support for the decision. In a letter to the editor of the Washington Post published on Dec. 27, adjunct professor Noura Erakat of the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies argued that the boycott draws international attention to Israel’s treatment of Palestinian citizens.
“The boycott, divestment and sanctions movement … is a call from Palestinians to international solidarity,” Erakat wrote. “By heeding it, the ASA did not single out Israel; it listened to Palestinians who demand equality.”
In his press release, DeGioia noted that university faculty might have differing positions on the issue of Israeli-Palestinian relations and made a commitment to supporting ideological diversity among members of the staff.
“I recognize these are matters on which colleagues can disagree,” the statement said. “While the position of our University remains opposed to any boycott, we will certainly defend the rights of those who disagree.”
According to Provost Robert Groves, however, the university administration agreed that the boycott violated free expression and academic dialogue.
“There was absolute unity on the principles that motivated the action,” Groves said. “We are devoted to freedom of ideas and disclosure among opposing viewpoints. That is what universities are about and what Georgetown is about.”
Groves further noted that Georgetown could never endorse any limitation on the free exchange of ideas, which would violate its fundamental academic principles.
“Our basic belief is that the role of Georgetown in a larger context is hearing different viewpoints,” he said. “This statement is evidence of our devotion to the principle, and as an academic institution, we wouldn’t do anything to suppress dialogue.”
Student groups also voiced support for President DeGioia’s rejection of the academic boycott.
J Street U President Jake Sorrells (COL ’16) noted the valuable role academia can play in promoting intercultural understanding and the detrimental effects of restricting it.
“I think that the boycott actually exacerbates a lot of the tensions between the two sides,” Sorrells said. “It allows a lot of the animosity, racism and ignorance that is driving this conflict to fester because the more people aren’t interacting with each other through dialogue, the more misconceptions about the other are really able to thrive.”
Sorrells also noted that while some recent Israeli actions could be viewed as warranting some form of condemnation or criticism, academia is not the appropriate setting for a response to them.
“I agree with the frustration and aggravation that is behind the boycott and that in some ways it is well meaning,” Sorrells said. “But I don’t think it’s the right tactic to go about achieving meaningful change.”
Across the country, over 90 universities have rejected the ASA proposal, including Harvard, Columbia, Dartmouth and Princeton, as well as many other Catholic institutions like Trinity College, The Catholic University of America, The University of Notre Dame and Loyola University-Maryland. Catholic University of America President John Garvey issued a particularly strong condemnation of the boycott.

Dr. Moisés Naím spoke about the changing dynamics of world power contributing to a more chaotic world in Riggs Library on Monday afternoon in a converstion with Director of Asian Studies Victor Cha, sponsored by the Office of the President.
Naím expanded on the theories in his book “The End of Power: From Boardrooms to Battlefields and Churches to States, Why Being In Charge Isn’t What It Used to Be.”
Naím, a senior associate in the International Economics Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and an internationally syndicated columnist, told the audience that scholars generally agree that there is a shift in power occurring worldwide, but his more provocative theory is that the nature of power itself has changed.
“The central message of the book is … that power has become easier to acquire, much harder to use and easier to lose,” Naím said.
This inconsistent nature of power is well demonstrated by the rise in start up businesses that challenge multinational, well-established corporations. Naím called these new powers that oppose traditional powers “micropowers.” He compared Kodak’s demise to the simultaneous success of Instagram.
“Kodak is no longer,” Naím said. “And very interestingly, at the very same time that Kodak was starting bankruptcy proceedings, Chapter 11 proceedings, a small company with 13 employees and three years of age was sold for a billion dollars. That company is called Instagram.”
This trend, Naím said, also translates to the battlefield. The changing nature of power allows for the success of “David and Goliath” stories outside of the business world. He discussed a study by a Harvard scholar that found that in contemporary battles, the weaker side, as designated by the number of weapons and other similar qualifications, was more likely to win.
“I think that the trends I describe are trends that reflect a world with more opportunity, with more possibilities, where those excluded can now have the hope and the opportunity of being included,” Naím said.
On the other hand, this optimism does not translate to politics in the same way. The new constraints of powers cause governmental risks and possible stagnation.
“In a world that is more full of opportunities, there is almost more risks,” Naím said. “The book also shows some of the risks that are mostly in the way we govern ourselves. And we have seen around the world the difficulty that governments are having in governing, making decisions and creating the consensus that is needed to move a society forward.”
Naím believes that this changing nature of power needs to be accounted for by governments.
Lauren Allen (SFS ’17), a member of the audience, which flowed out the library doors, said she was interested in Naím’s idea that young people have a greater ability to gain power in the current climate.
“It stood out to me how the world is so much younger, and it’s talking about these small companies that are headed by very young people that end up being micropowers and just how changeable the power scene is now,” Allen said. “Things are not as fixed as they used to be and I think that’s just a crazy concept.”

About 50 members of the Class of 2017 reunited in Gaston Hall on Tuesday, Jan 7, for the first annual Winter Confluence, an event marked by reflection and a keynote speech by human rights activist and daughter of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Naomi Tutu.
“This winter event gives first-year students an opportunity to reflect on where they have been since NSO and where they want to go in the semesters ahead,” Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., said. “They are in a very different place than where they were in August. … With some wisdom shared by presenters, they hopefully will be able to make some good decisions about the direction of their Georgetown experience.”
The event, planned by Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Director of Orientation Justin Smith, allowed attending freshmen to reflect on their first semester of college and honor the Georgetown community’s commitment to justice. The evening featured multiple speakers and a special centennial tribute to the late Polish World War II resistance movement fighter and Georgetown professor Jan Karski.
Building upon the theme of reflection, Tutu recounted how the African proverb “A person is a person through other people” extends beyond the Georgetown community.
“The lesson is that we in this world are connected to one another in ways that sometimes are not even clear, that we are connected to those for whom we do something good, that when you do good for someone else, in a real way you do good for yourself,” Tutu said.
She stressed that this theme applies to Georgetown’s campus and students, especially as many embark on new goals, resolutions and adventures this semester.
Freshman speaker Eric Wu (SFS ’17) shared his own Georgetown story, emphasizing the different narratives of Georgetown students. He was chosen after his proseminar professor, Elizabeth Stephen, nominated him for the speakership spot.
“The last thing that I wanted to do was follow in my mom’s footsteps. I wanted to be different, and I wanted to blaze my own trail. What I found, however, in my few short months here at Georgetown is there is no better place to write your own story than here,” Wu, whose mother is an alumna, said. “I’m in the process of writing a Georgetown story that could not be more different from that of my own mother. What’s more, each and every one of you is currently writing a Georgetown story that is immeasurably different from mine.”
The event also commemorated Karski on the 70th anniversary of the publication of his book “Story of a Secret” and what would be his 100th birthday. Mark Lagon, professor in the practice of international affairs, discussed Karski’s past accomplishments and life story. To close, O’Brien reflected on the years to come.
“The next few years of your time, let this be a playground of wisdom and of virtue, and in so doing when you get to that end, the senior convocation, the senior ball and the commencement activities, then you’ll be ready,” O’Brien said.
Attendees enjoyed the opportunity for reflection and preparation for their upcoming semesters.
“I thought the event was a really good segue into the second semester of our freshman year,” Monika Patel (MSB ’17) said. “I think it was important that they had us reflect on what was good and bad, because that’s important to consider going forward –– to focus on things you need to improve on and remember the things that have gone well in the past and use that as encouragement.”

Professor Marilyn McMorrow’s 10 students sat on couches and chairs in her McCarthy Hall apartment discussing their final essays for “Just War Theory in the 21st Century.” It was the last week of the fall semester in an international politics course with a unique dynamic: two of the “seniors” in the course were over 65 years old.
These two experienced students, Chuck Cohen and Dr. Chuck Abrams, both 68, are members of the Georgetown Senior Citizen Auditor Program. Administered by the School of Continuing Studies, the nearly 30-year-old program has helped hundreds of seniors use their years of experience to contribute to the classroom while learning something new themselves. Over 50 seniors participated in the program in the fall, across all four undergraduate schools, according to Assistant Dean of Graduate Liberal Studies and SCAP Director Anne Ridder.
For Cohen, an attorney at Morgan Lewis’s Labor and Employment Practice, the class was a chance to learn and share some of his real-world knowledge with others.
“I’d attended three other courses at Georgetown before this one, and they have all been great experiences,” Cohen said. “The Senior Auditor Program has given me the opportunity to delve into areas that I’ve always been interested in.”
Abrams, a gastroenterology and internal medicine specialist, works at Abrams and Lipson MDs PC. McMorrow’s class was his second taken on the Hilltop, and he has since enrolled in an Eastern European History course for the spring.
“The ability to interact with bright, passionate young minds and welcoming professors has been a great opportunity,” Abrams said.
Depending on the professor, senior auditors can act as casual observers or actively participate in the class discussion.
In “Just War Theory in the 21st Century,” the senior auditors were a huge boon to discussion, according to McMorrow.
“We’ve discussed why the Geneva Conventions forbid the use of serrated blades in battle,and Dr. Abrams has been able to explain the medical reason behind this, and then we will go over international law concerning enemy combatants, and Mr. Cohen can share with us his legal interpretations,” McMorrow said. “Having them in class has really elevated the discourse.”
For the students in McMorrow’s course, the presence of the both Chucks in class has added to their educational experience.
“Besides their professional expertise, I really appreciated their humor and active participation in discussions,” class member Agree Ahmed (SFS ’15) said. “It’s nice to have people in the room who don’t spend their waking hours dealing with pure academic topics, and who have real-world knowledge on these subjects.”
Although senior auditors do not take tests or write papers, they are responsible for completing the reading and for the material discussed in class sessions.
Christian Chung (SFS ’15) agreed that Abrams and Cohen were integral parts of the class.
“Auditor is a misnomer in their case because they didn’t just sit back and listen –– they are just as active as any of us when we asked them for their thoughts,” Chung said.
“I like to think that Chuck and I helped keep things light and fun and were able to help put things in perspective and share our frame of reference on certain subjects,” Abrams said.
Ridder believes that these unique classroom experiences can positively affect the at times testy student-resident relations in the Georgetown neighborhood.
“Over half of our current auditors live in the 20007 zip code, so they are active members of the community, and they are all for us working together to help improve relations,” Ridder said.
Abrams’ perception of the students in his class was extremely positive, and he shared his admiration for his younger classmates.
“I’m so impressed with the breadth of knowledge and comprehension that these students had with challenging material,” he said. “I’m even more impressed that they were willing to be skeptical of the readings, to question the ideas of the authors and forge their own opinion on the issues.”

The free speech restrictions around O’ Donovan Hall once again prevented student groups that are not recognized by the university from tabling at the Student Activities Fair Jan. 11.
During the SA Fair, student groups that are unrecognized by the university were only permitted to table outside or hand out flyers inside Leo’s.
“Unlike Red Square, the outside area adjacent to Leo’s is not designated for tabling, which is why groups last [spring] semester were instructed to only hand out flyers,” Center for Student Engagement Associate Director Amanda Carlton wrote in an email.
For the Student Activities Commission, which organizes the fair, the planning process includes keeping in mind the needs of all student groups, including unrecognized groups. Greek affiliates like sororities and fraternities, clubs that conflict with university policies like the pro-choice H*yas for Choice and other organizations that have yet to gain SAC approval are all among unrecognized groups.
“It’s just kind of being flexible with it, it’s just understanding that every single student wants groups to represent their groups and understanding that there’s an administrative reasoning with student groups,” Student Activities Commissioner Priyanka Bagrodia (SFS ’16) said.
Bagrodia noted that distributing flyers inside Leo’s was permitted as long as group members did not overwhelm students and keep them from accessing recognized groups.
“The administrative reasoning behind it is because Georgetown doesn’t recognize the groups like sororities, frats, so if people say that they signed up for sororities and frats at the Student Activities Fair, then we’d be held liable,” Bagrodia said. “That’s why we can’t have them officially table with all the other groups, but I still want Hoyas to like the groups, so we allow them to flyer inside.”
For members of the unrecognized groups, strategizing ways to reach out to students is important in the face of barriers created by the inability to access benefits available to other clubs. However, the setup of the SA Fair may have helped these groups receive more student attention.
“I think actually it’s going to work even better because we’re going to be outside at the front, so even as people walk in they will pass by us,” Sigma Alpha Epsilon Deputy Recruitment Chair Tanner Davis (SFS ’17) said.
SAE cited 140 students who demonstrated interest in the fraternity, either by attending an information session or rushing in the fall semester.
“I don’t think the fact that we’re not recognized by the school is a deterrent at all,” Davis said.
The SA Fair additionally featured six new SAC groups this semester.
“I think student life communities at Georgetown have been growing,” SAC Chair Patrick Musgrave (COL ’16) said. “It’s six more SAC groups, but definitely there are going to be more groups, and it’s going to provide a larger fair so people can really find their interests.”

The Georgetown University Student Association has partnered with the LGBTQ Resource Center to create an LGBTQ peer mentorship program. The program, which is scheduled to begin in fall 2014, will encourage underrepresented students in the LGBTQ community to assume leadership roles and get more involved in campus life while at Georgetown.
“On campus, there’s a disparity between certain populations and the number of people in those populations with leadership roles, so you see some groups unrepresented in clubs, club leadership roles, and we wanted to find a way to combat this,” GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said. Tisa added that the mentorship program will encourage students to get involved in clubs and organizations by pairing upperclassmen mentors with underclassmen.
Mentors will meet with mentees in small group settings around campus. The Corp will provide two to three free coffee subsidies for each group, according to GUSA Secretary of Diversity Affairs Minjung Kang (SFS ’15).
“The upperclassmen have different perspectives and can provide advice for underclassmen who don’t have the opportunity to ask those kind of questions as just being a general member as part of an organization,” Kang said.
Kang said that GUSA hopes to provide a speaker in the fields of business and government.
“That will give the mentors and mentees an opportunity to interact with professionals and get more general advice about how the LGBTQ community is in different industries and how it’s like to be part of that community in a more professional environment,” Kang said.
The LGBTQ Resource Center has provided advice and resources as well as committing to provide training for future mentors.
“It’s been fantastic,” Tisa said. “They’ve been working on the curriculum, working on the training, to connect with resources that the LGBTQ Center already has. It’s one of the most well-known LGBTQ programs, certainly at a Catholic school, in the country, so it’s been really great to partner with them.”
LGBTQ Center Director Sivagami Subbaraman explained that the LGBTQ Resource Center helped GUSA to design the initiative, a welcome new feature of the Center’s programming.
“The Center worked with GUSA representatives to help develop guidelines on how to recruit mentors and mentees, and to provide some insight into [what] it might look like,” Subbaraman said.
Mentors will be chosen from a pool of applicants comprised of upperclassmen members of the LGBTQ community.
“We’re looking for people who are involved in all different aspects of campus life, not just GU Pride or even GUSA,” GUSA Undersecretary of LGBTQ Affairs Meghan Ferguson (COL ’15) said. “That way, potential mentees can find someone who shares similar interests with them and can actually act as a much better mentor.”
Applications for mentors are currently open, and mentee applications will be released in upcoming weeks. The program, slated to start next fall, will be a pilot program for other potential mentorship programs to come, according to Tisa.
“I think it’s really important for me personally, as the first gay president at Georgetown, to make it clear that I can’t be the last,” he said. “We really need to promote not only LGBTQ communities but also communities of color and women to take leadership roles at Georgetown because there’s still a disparity. … We want to demonstrate that anything is possible for a Georgetown student here, and that you don’t need to be held back because of socioeconomic or personal identity qualities.”

With the opening of the Northeast Triangle delayed to summer 2016, the university has continued to refine the new hall’s plans and push forward on a host of other building projects including the Healey Family Student Center, the conversions of Ryan and Mulledy Halls and the repurposing of two floors in the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center.
“Our efforts are focused on the exterior architecture so that we can get Old Georgetown Board’s approval,” Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said.
After failing to get final concept approval and receiving aesthetic recommendations from the OGB for the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall in December, architects and administrators have been working to incorporate the OGB’s suggestions into the building’s design.
In response to the OGB’s request for the creation of a southern entrance to the Northeast Triangle, architects plan to shift the multi-purpose room, located on the southeast side of the first floor, to the east. This alteration will allow for a corridor that will connect the new entrance to the rest of the building.
The university will review these changes during a Northeast Triangle team meeting next week. Morey said that he anticipates receiving OGB concept approval in March.
In response to the Northeast Triangle’s delay, the university is continuing with preliminary plans for the partial conversion of the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center into temporary student housing. According to Morey, administrators are currently determining how the loss of up to two floors of hotel rooms would affect the university’s mission, as well as how students would use the space.
“Students would probably come in from the esplanade and utilize the second floor,” Morey said. “We would black out the elevators so that they only reach certain floors.”
Morey said that the university has not yet determined the potential revenue loss that would result from the limited use of the hotel.
Last month the university selected Ayers Saint Gross, an architect firm known for its focus on university work, to lead the conversion of Ryan and Mulledy Halls into student housing.
Architects have begun initial walk-throughs of the buildings, but specific details about the halls’ designs have yet to be determined.
While the university anticipates that the renovation of the buildings will be complete by summer 2015, that timeline may change as architects learn more about the buildings’ structures.
“We might get in there and find out there is a structural issue and that might take longer than we anticipated,” Morey said.
According to an email from the Office of Planning and Facilities Management, as of Jan. 2, Prospect Street has been closed to inbound and outbound traffic between the hours of 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. until March 15, due to Healey Family Student Center construction.
Due to the street closure, Georgetown University Transportation Shuttles travelling to Rosslyn, Arlington and the Law Center have been rerouted. The buses now travel down Reservoir Road and Foxhall Road instead of Prospect Street, resulting in increased trip times.
In addition to the progress that has been made with on-campus planning, significant advances have been made with neighborhood planning.
Last month, the Georgetown Business Improvement District finalized “Georgetown 2028,” a 15-year plan that aims to improve Georgetown’s commercial district. The plan includes a 78-item “Action Agenda,” which addresses such goals as the improvement of roadway and parking management and the creation of new transportation options such as a Georgetown Metro stop and a gondola.

Indian women of the “untouchable” caste increase their economic and social standing after converting to Christianity, a recent study by Berkley Center research fellow Rebecca Shah shows.
The research, presented at the Dec. 13-14 “Christianity and Freedom” conference in Rome as part of Georgetown University’s Christianity and Freedom initiative, focused on Dalit women in a violent Indian slum and related both the community and tenets of Christianity to a willingness to invest in their personal, economic and social future.
“What actually keeps the poor in poverty and keeps them in persistent poverty is this sort of fear of investing in the future, a fear of long-term investments,” Shah said.
According to Shah, Christianity is an important factor in changing this fearful mindset. Much of the change in the converted women’s behaviors stems from a sense of belonging in the supportive community Christianity brings.
“One thing we noticed with these women was being part of the [Christian] community … it sort of gave them the sense of some sort of hope that the future was attainable,” Shah said.
The close community additionally caused some women to sense a change in identity.
“There is a sense of belief that ‘I can make a difference, I can invest in my children’s future,’ and that to a great extent comes by their involvement in these independent churches,” Shah said.
Shah noted in her findings that although the Christian women were more often faced with domestic violence, in part due to the new independence that comes with converting, these converts were more likely to tell someone about the violence. Sixty-three percent of converted Christians experienced domestic abuse, with 57 percent reporting the incidents. By contrast, only 7 percent of Hindu victims reported abuse, while there were no reports from Muslim women, according to Shah.
Allen Hertzke, co-chair of the Christianity and Freedom initiative’s steering committee, attributed the change in identity and newfound independence to the conversion experience itself, not just the presence of a strong community.
“So it’s not just the fact that Christianity is instrumental in creating this sense of community or community networks or community support, but that the Christian message and the Christian conversion experience itself actually shaped the way these women saw themselves,” Hertzke said.
Robert Woodberry, another researcher who presented his findings at the conference, additionally attributed the change in behavior of Dalit women to factors involving Christianity beyond the community aspect. Woodberry believes changes in views on identity and self-worth were primarily due to the tenets of Christianity.
“In terms of theological beliefs, the idea that everyone is created in God’s image … is a theological resource within Christianity that can transform people,” Woodberry said.
