This academic year flew by in a whirlwind of memorable highs and lows. With its culmination, the Editorial Board presents the annual Cheers and Jeers.
 
Cheers to Putting DMT Behind Us
When a DMT lab was found in a Harbin dorm room on Oct. 23, the integrity of the Georgetown community and its students was immediately called into question. National media outlets speculated about an underground world of drugs, Harbin residents barely on campus for two months chose to leave the Hilltop because of the scandal and the rest of us waited with bated breath to see what would happen next.
Fortunately, the answer was quite simple: nothing. Subsequent investigations did not lead to mass arrests, and the Georgetown community refused to allow this one anomaly to supersede its centuries-old identity. Former School of Foreign Service freshman Charles Smith and his friend, former University of Richmond student John Perrone, were quietly charged with lenient sentences while Smith’s acquited roommate has been able to assimilate back into campus life this spring. Life on the Hilltop has returned to normal.
While the DMT incident will forever remain in the memories of those who were here to experience it, it has faded into just that — a memory. The campus community has not let the incident define the Georgetown experience, and that in itself is a victory.
Jeers to a Rise in Crime
Crime levels this academic year have effectively debunked the Georgetown community’s false sense of security.
With laptop thefts in areas like Village A and Lauinger Library totalling over 45 and the most recent horrifying instance of Georgetown students being tied up as they were robbed in their Burleith residence just over two weeks ago, crime in Georgetown become more apparent this year. Burglaries have risen 65 percent and violent crime in Georgetown is up 13 percent since the beginning of the academic year, according to the Metropolitan Police Department crime map. By comparison, burglaries in the District have increased by only 29 percent and total violent crime is down 7 percent.
Though Georgetown remains an affluent neighborhood, the location no longer guarantees security. The careless attitudes of some students and local residents are partially to blame, but the Department of Public Safety and MPD have also failed to respond effectively and implement adequate preventative measures.
One recent DPS attempt at crime prevention was the installation of surveillance cameras outside each residence hall, announced in late March. This measure was simply too little, too late as the cameras do not seem to have done much to curb the rising crime rate and failed to address off-campus crime. An increase in attention to the West Georgetown area in DPS patrols also seemed to yield few results.
It’s safe to say that this academic year has not ended on a high note for DPS and MPD, but hopefully the recent infractions will be sufficient catalysts for the innovation and vigilance needed to ensure security on the Hilltop once more.
Cheers to Easing the Money Allocation Headache
Participating in student activities, like much else at Georgetown, is an experience often tainted by bureaucracy. But things got a little bit easier this year as students reformed both the amount of money available and the guidelines controlling the use of that money.
The first change came this fall when Georgetown University Student Association decided to revamp the Student Activities Fee, which the university automatically charges all undergraduates. GUSA calculated that funds available to groups would double if 100 percent of the fee was allocated to clubs along with increasing the fee from $100 to $125 the first year and to $150 the next.
Spurred on by the rise in funds available to clubs after SAFE reform, group leaders united against the Student Activities Commission this spring to demand more of a formal role in making allocation decisions. After vigorous debate, open letters and a town hall, SAC agreed to alter the funding guidelines that it had implemented in the fall. With the revisions, club leaders can create ad hoc events by using funds previously allocated to other parts of their programming arc.
We applaud GUSA for asking students to give a little more in return for improving the experience many students will undoubtedly have in the future. We also commend SAC for creating more transparency, cutting down on bureaucracy and seeking to truly help the clubs it claims to serve. Both efforts this year will be instrumental in funding a brighter future for Georgetown student activities, the soul of student life of campus.
Cheers to Grace Under Fire Abroad
Calling it a rough semester for the Office of International Programs would be an understatement. The overthrow of Hosni Mubarak’s regime in Egypt and the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in Japan effectively ended many students’ semesters abroad, but OIP successfully ensured some students’ transition to foreign studies at other, less crisis-ridden locations. Others chose alternative options for the semester, and the remaining students who opted to return to the Hilltop for a full semester of classes found the shift seamless, thanks to university assistance.
Georgetown has proven it has a superior ability to deal with these types of crises. With university resources in the Middle East, Georgetown was successfully able to remove the students from the tumult as well as provide them with alternative programs in locations like its Doha, Qatar campus. Likewise, the devastating earthquake in Japan forced Georgetown to cancel all spring semester programs in the country, leaving students to seek alternative plans for the semester.
Although current events did not work in some students’ favor this time around, Georgetown acted swiftly and effectively to mitigate such danger. All members of our community should be reassured by the university’s vigilance and take comfort that Georgetown students near and far are guaranteed to return safe and sound under OIP’s watch.
Jeers to Deteriorating Town-Gown Relations
Washington, D.C. is making it very hard for Georgetown and its students to feel welcome.
The D.C. Noise Ordinance implemented in February brought with it a 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. ban on excessive loudness; violators of the law could face arrest, a $500 fine and a marred permanent record. Once it was enacted, students concerned by the law’s potential to affect their late-night plans saw the worsening of an already-tense relationship with their neighbors.
The effects of the noise law, however, were minimal in comparison to the heightened debate over the university’s 2010 Campus Plan this year. The university’s battle with its neighbors came to a head earlier this month, when the District’s Office of Planning called on Georgetown to house 100 percent of its students on campus by 2016. Now Georgetown finds itself at a juncture with the surrounding neighborhood.
While the university already guarantees two years of on-campus housing, requiring an entire extra year would mean at least 1,500 additional students on campus. It is time that the students make their presence felt as they face a movement against the campus community.
Georgetown students must begin to take an interest in their campus’s future and their own well-being. That any loud noise after 10 p.m. warrants an arrest is an egregious violation of rights in itself. Georgetown also currently does not have the space to house these students, short of buying out all of Burleith or West Georgetown. Such a demand is entirely unrealistic and poses a threat to the advancement of Georgetown as a university. It’s high time for students to step up in support of the university moving forward so that we have a neighborhood to call home.

Four years after they began their Georgetown careers with New Student Orientation, seniors in the class of 2011 are participating in another whirlwind week of university-sponsored activities.
Senior Week is a chance for seniors to celebrate on the Hilltop one last time before graduation. It is also the time to say farewell to the university life that has, for most, become second nature.
Andrew Zhen (MSB ’11) described the conflicting emotions that the week can inspire.
“It’s fun hanging out with your friends and having no more academic responsibilities, but you also know that this is all about to end at the end of the week,” he said.
Zhen added that he has made an effort to focus on the positive.
“I’ve learned to live in the moment and take advantage of the time we have now. Sure, we’re going to graduate in a few days, but it’s important to enjoy and make the most out of each and every day leading up to ‘the end.'”
The fast-paced nature of Senior Week, which is packed with day trips, bar crawls and last chance lectures, may also keep many seniors from feeling too anxious about their imminent graduation. The seven-day marathon of activities began last Saturday with an excursion to Ocean City, Md., a trip to the famous Ben’s Chili Bowl and the Senior Retreat.
From there, the week charged forward with keg parties, a scavenger hunt, ice cream socials and other class bonding events. Some of the week’s festivities have become traditions, tales of which are passed down to each graduating class.
Bill Nelson (COL ’11) cited one of the most popular Senior Week events as the one he was most excited about,
“I’m particularly looking forward to the President’s Picnic. All of the alumni I’ve spoken with say it’s a highlight every year,” he said.
For Alex Peterson (COL ’11), the inclusion of America’s pastime in the schedule made his senior week. He pointed to the Washington Nationals game as his favorite event.
“I really enjoyed the baseball game, as it was an opportunity to enjoy good food and good company while watching two mediocre teams compete. I wanted to see the Nationals play before leaving D.C., and Georgetown let me check off that item from the bucket list while getting in some last goodbyes too.”
Saying farewell has been a major theme for many seniors during this period. For some, those goodbyes include not only close friends, but also the professors and administrators who have shaped their life at Georgetown intellectually.
“I attended Fr. Maher’s last chance lecture yesterday, and he gave a great talk sharing his perspective on Georgetown, graduation and life … [He] closed by recommending that we find just a few people around campus this week, and tell them ‘I love you,’ ‘I’m sorry,’ or ‘thank you.'” Brian Miller (COL ’11) recalled. “So, over the next few days, as I see the people who have defined my Georgetown experience, I’m going to try to follow his advice,” Brian Miller (COL ’11) said.
Peterson also emphasized the importance of capitalizing on this last opportunity to bond with those who have been most important during his career at Georgetown.
“I’ve spent most of my time seeing those closest to me for one last time, but it’s amazing how many connections and bonds one can make in these few years,” he said. “I’m fine with missing a fun event or even a famous speaker, but I wouldn’t give up the chance to spend a few final minutes with my loved ones for all the world.”
For some, Senior Week will also represent their heritage. Students who have been involved in and have advanced the interests of the Asian community while at Georgetown will be honored today in an inaugural commencement ceremony. The ceremony will precede the Harambee Graduation, which recognizes the achievements of African American seniors, and follow Despedida, which honors the students who have contributed to the Latino community.
Chris Kinney (COL ’11), who has been involved with the Japan Network on campus and who will be attending the ceremony, spoke of the importance of beginning the tradition of Asian Graduation.

Georgetown will not be offering any spots to students still on the school’s waitlist after nearly half of all accepted students for the class of 2015 opted to attend the Hilltop this fall.
The 48.5 percent yield rate represents a significant increase from those of previous years. The classes of 2014, 2013 and 2012 had yield rates of 43.4, 42.1 and 45.7 percent respectively, according to Charles Deacon, dean of undergraduate admissions.
Deacon said that the Office of Undergraduate Admissions took into account both the students that would defer their studies at Georgetown for a year as well as the applicants that may choose to attend other universities after being taken off of their waitlists.
“We have essentially overbooked, but we expect some will defect,” he said, adding that his office expects the Class of 2015 will hit its target number of 1,580 students.
Georgetown also met many of its admissions goals in terms of diversity. The incoming freshman class includes at least one student from all 50 states in the U.S. New York has demonstrated the highest yield after slightly edging out California, the state with the highest number of applicants.
Those who are not U.S. residents will arrive from 49 nations around the world this fall. Deacon said that of the almost 2,400 international students who applied to Georgetown, about 15 percent were admitted. About half of that group has committed to enrollment.
Additionally, 151 African-American students and a record-high 169 Latino students have committed to Georgetown, giving the university a 40.5 and 45.6 percent yield rate respectively among these groups.
Though each of the four undergraduate schools saw a jump in yield — 48.7 percent at the School of Foreign Service, 52.9 percent at the School of Nursing and Health Studies and 41.2 percent at the College — the biggest increase was at the McDonough School of Business, where 340 of the 536 accepted students will be studying next year. This 63.4 percent yield rate represents a statistical increase of 7.3 percent from last year’s data.
Deacon said that the rise in the appeal of the business school, which jumped to the 10th spot in Bloomberg Businessweek’s 2011 ranking of undergraduate programs, could be attributed to a set of factors.
“The new facility helps,” he said, “I also think the financial improvement [in the economy] recently convinced kids to apply to McDonough.”
Georgetown’s overall yield is more than 10 points higher than that of neighboring school The George Washington University, which experienced a drop in its rate for this application cycle. According to The Hatchet, the GWU student newspaper, 33 percent of 7,022 students admitted to the school’s Class of 2015 have signaled their intention to enroll through an initial deposit.
Harvard University, by comparison, saw a yield rate of 77 percent this year. Other peer institutions have not announced their yield rates for the Class of 2015 at this time.
Georgetown’s Office of Undergraduate Admissions is happy with the progress and the popularity seen in the university’s high yield rate and an unprecedented total of 19,275 applications received.
Deacon also said that steps taken by the admissions team and the Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program could have contributed to this spike in appeal.
GAAP, a student-run organization that aims to inform prospective students about the university, holds several open house weekends for those accepted to Georgetown so that they may explore life on the Hilltop.
“We had a good turnout at GAAP open houses and we had really great responses from those people [who attended],” Deacon said.
Deacon also mentioned the positive effects of new efforts the organization has taken to reach out to Georgetown hopefuls through social media.
GAAP has established an official Facebook group for the purpose of connecting members of the new freshman class.
The webpage, which has over 1,000 members, is described as “a forum for you [members of the Class of 2015] to get to know one another and have your questions answered by current Hoyas.”
“That social media impact is hard to measure,” Deacon said. “But for people on the fence, that could have been the thing that pushed them over.”
On the whole, Deacon said he was pleased with the Class of 2015’s yield rate.
“We have had a dramatically good year,” he said.

I still find it hard to think that my time at Georgetown is ending. For the past four years, this place has been home. As I inch closer and closer to my graduation, I’ve realized that I’m not quite ready for this to end, and I don’t want to leave behind something that means so much to me. In my four years, I’ve gone from considering transferring to realizing that there is no place I would rather be. With graduation looming, I’ve tried to think of why this experience mattered and what I’ve learned over the past four years.
My nostalgia for leaving clearly shows the significance of this time to me. Most of us were initially drawn to Georgetown due to its academic reputation, and after four years it is clear to me that the reputation is well earned. But I can’t remember every lecture that I’ve been to, and I can’t remember every assignment I’ve completed.
I do know that the classes I took at Georgetown taught me to think in a way that I couldn’t before because for four years I was challenged every day by my teachers and my classmates. While I don’t know all the lessons, I remember the teachers who inspired me. I remember all those late nights on the second floor of Lauinger Library and in the Leavey Center, where having some friends around made working through the night so much more enjoyable. And I remember those late nights where homework got pushed aside for deep conversations into the night with those friends.
Those teachers and those nights are more than just the standard college academic experience. They are a part of the outside-of-the-classroom experiences at Georgetown that make it so hard for me to leave the Hilltop. Over my four years, my life outside the classroom has made me into who I am today. Since freshman year, I helped run The Corp, Relay-ed For Life, danced to Coolio in O’Donovan Hall, lived in an Italian villa, listened to President Obama and celebrated Georgetown Day. But while all of those are incredible in and of themselves, the amount that I enjoy every ordinary day here makes this place so special.
While I have loved Georgetown, it has not been easy. There has been disappointment, frustration, failure and days that seem too hard to get through. But even on those tough days, when everything seems to be going wrong, I could always still be glad I was here. When things were rough, there were always people around who cared — that’s how I know Georgetown was right for me. The everyday living was more than I could ever have hoped for. When I’m on campus, I find myself laughing constantly. Perhaps I am just easily amused, but I think this shows that I’m enjoying every moment I’m here. More than anything else, my time at Georgetown has taught me to realize what is important to me. I came to further appreciate the people around me who cared about me. Every day I was surrounded by extraordinary people, and you all are the reason why I’m not ready to leave yet.
When next fall rolls around, I’m going to miss not being in New Student Orientation. I’ll miss basketball games, The Tombs, Chicken Finger Thursdays, the District’s inability to handle snow, Qdoba Mondays, iced coffee, Alternative Spring Break and The Corp. But most of all, I’m going to miss being surrounded by so many people who I love to be with, who challenge and bring out the best in me. Thank you to everyone who has made my Georgetown experience what it has been.
Josh Feller is a senior in the College. He served as the chief operating officer of The Corp.

Commissioners and witnesses continued to criticize the 2010 Campus Plan at the Zoning Commission hearing Monday night.
Opponents cited disruptive nighttime outdoor activity, landscape deterioration, trash overflow and an adverse effect on home value as signs of students’ impact on the state of houses in the Georgetown community.
Neighborhood opponents also claimed that the university was not taking the responsibility to monitor and discipline the behavior of its students.
“We want Georgetown University to be the kind of citizen that it is dedicated to producing,” said Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3D Commissioner Ann Haas, who represents Foxhall Village.
Although the commissioners mainly focused on the problems caused by undergraduate off-campus housing, they also suggested that the university house more graduate students on campus and create a shuttle between the campus and the bars on M Street.
“As long as the number of students being housed on campus is less than 100 percent, it frees far too many undergraduates to live off campus in the surrounding community,” said ANC2E Chair Ron Lewis, who represents the Georgetown and Burleith neighborhoods. “The zoning rules provide the tools to repair this situation, and the time to do this is now.”
George Oberlander, an expert witness for the Citizens Association of Georgetown, was also allowed to testify. Oberlander, the former director of the National Capital Planning Institute and a city planning expert who recently published a report on the West Georgetown and Burleith neighborhoods, stressed that the 2010 Campus Plan would only exacerbate the community’s current problems. He urged the university to house all undergraduate students on campus while providing housing for other students on a satellite campus.
Seven members of the Georgetown community testified, including university employees, graduates, former ANC members and Director of Campus Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J.
University representatives stressed that it is only a minority of Georgetown students who create disturbances in the local community, while emphasizing that the university has measures in place to deal with such problems.
“I’m shocked by the anger apparent in the [Citizens Association of Georgetown] newsletter. It’s certainly not my reality,” said Edward Machir (MSB ’74), a Georgetown resident and adjunct professor in the McDonough School of Business.
Former ANC2E Chair Grace Bateman argued that housing all students on campus would worsen the neighborhood’s noise and upkeep problems.
“Georgetown and Burleith are part of a larger, urban community where there is always demand for group housing,” she said. “At least we have the university controlling the situation now.”
The university’s proposed loop road also dominated much of the conversation Monday night. The road, which would run parallel to Glover-Archibold Park behind Yates Field House and McDonough Gymnasium, faced opposition from Foxhall residents and the District Department of Transportation.
DDOT stated in its testimony that it opposed the 2010 Campus Plan, claiming that the university provided insufficient information to properly conduct an impact analysis for the loop road’s changes to traffic patterns in the Georgetown community.
Associate Director of DDOT’s Policy, Planning and Sustainability Administration Karina Ricks argued that DDOT could provide a more comprehensive report if it is given more traffic data about the university’s intersection with Canal Road and the intersection of 38th Street and Reservoir Road.
“We believe that they haven’t shown us enough specificity in design … to understand what the impact on traffic would be,” she said.
Maureen Dwyer, an attorney for the university, said the required information could be collected in three weeks. This data could then be analyzed into a cohesive report within two weeks, according to Ricks.
Anthony Hood decided to hold off the cross-examination of the DDOT report until the commission’s next meeting.
Hearings will reconvene on June 2, when the remainder of the witnesses in support of the 2010 Campus Plan will testify. Local neighborhood associations will also be allotted 45 more minutes for their presentation.
“I think the meetings are plodding along as expected,” ANC2E Commissioner Bill Starrels said. “These things always go on longer than one would hope, [but] I thought the ANC and Georgetown did a good job of presenting their testimony.”

The Public Safety Alert sent out after an armed burglary two weeks ago differed significantly from the Metropolitan Police Department report that was publicly available earlier in the day.
Three Georgetown students were victims of an armed burglary at their home on the 3500 block of S Street at 12:13 a.m. on Saturday, May 6. Three suspects entered the house, one carrying a gun. They tied up the residents and stole two laptops and three cell phones.
A PSA was emailed to the campus community more than 12 hours after the incident occurred, after the story had been discussed on Twitter and reported by THE HOYA.
DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith could not speak directly to why DPS’s PSA was not sent until the afternoon after the incident, although he did say that alerts must be reviewed by several people before they can be sent out.
“There’s no set timeline on sending an alert. There’s a number of factors involved in gathering that information,” he said. “First it’s disseminated to university leadership, and they’re given a chance to review the PSA. So it goes through the review process and then it’s published. There’s a variety of variables involved.”
There were several differences between MPD’s account, which was available earlier that morning, and the alert sent out that day.
According to MPD, the burglary started at 12:13 a.m. and no non-Georgetown students were listed as complainants. DPS reported that the burglary occurred at 1 a.m. and added that the suspects were looking for a resident who was not a Georgetown student and was not in the house at the time. According to MPD, two laptops and three cell phones were taken, but DPS reported that three laptops and other electronic devices were taken.
The descriptions of the suspects in the case also differed. MPD described three suspects, all black males. One was wearing black pants and a black coat while brandishing a gun, one was
wearing a gray coat and gray pants and the other was wearing a black jacket and black pants. DPS only provided descriptions for two of the suspects, reporting that both were black males. The suspect with the gun was described as wearing a black sweatshirt and blue jeans, while the other suspect was described as short and wearing blue jeans.
According to Smith, the discrepancies may have occurred because of confusion at the crime scene.
“A lot of times when you first get on the scene of a crime you are gathering information, and it may not be complete or accurate until everybody involved has been thoroughly talked to. I think there was inaccurate information at first. The MPD information came out after the information we received,” he said.
Smith and university administrators said that MPD was the most reliable source of information regarding crime in the neighborhood, since MPD leads all criminal investigations.
“PSAs are based on the best information available at the time. MPD is leading this investigation, and DPS is working cooperatively with them,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh wrote in an email. “Any questions about the specifics of these cases should be directed to MPD.”
This high-profile burglary came at the end of a school year marked by a dramatic increase in crime throughout the Georgetown area. The burglary was the fourth such incident in the West Georgetown and Burleith sections of 35th Street. There have been 12 PSAs regarding burglaries and robberies in the neighborhood since Jan. 1 — three on campus, one in Burleith and eight in West Georgetown.
The MPD Public Service Area 206, which includes the Georgetown campus, West Georgetown and Burleith, has seen a 65 percent increase in burglaries and a 10 percent increase in thefts since Sept. 1, 2010, in comparison with the same period from Sept. 1, 2009, to May 16, 2010. Additionally, violent crime in the area has surged 12 percent.
“There has definitely been an increase,” said Smith. “That has been noticed and it is something of concern.”
Smith said that he was not at liberty to discuss possible connections between these incidents because they are ongoing criminal investigations.
“I can say that both MPD and DPS are paying extra attention to the 35th Street area, and we are working with the victims to address their safety concerns,” he wrote in an email.
“Criminals are being apprehended. No one’s turning a blind eye to safety. That is our primary focus,” he added.

As Senior Week transitioned into Commencement Weekend, members of the Class of 2011 gathered in McDonough Arena Thursday to observe senior convocation.
Unlike many of the ceremonies this weekend that are school-specific, convocation was a moment for the students of all four undergraduate schools and the School of Continuing Studies to jointly commemorate their achievements.
With families and friends looking on from the side risers, the seniors listened to University Provost James O’Donnell describe the Class of 2011 by numbers. He listed each one of the 57 nations outside of the United States that are represented in the class, including South Korea, the United Kingdom and the Sudan. He also noted that many students have been awarded competitive fellowships, including six Fulbright scholars and that 52 seniors have accepted positions with Teach for America, a record for a graduating class at Georgetown.
Jacqueline DesJardin (COL ’11), a star goalkeeper on the women’s soccer team and a neurobiology major, and Loghman Fattahi (SFS ’11), a native of Iran who will pursue a master’s in law and diplomacy at Tufts University, spoke after O’Donnell.
Although they hail from different backgrounds and have studied in different disciplines, DesJardin and Fattahi’s messages to their classmates complemented each other. DesJardin began by speaking of the challenges associated with living up to one’s potential.
“Growing up, I loathed the word ‘potential,'” she said. Detailing obstacles she faced early in her college career, she recalled her fear that she was wasting the talent that her parents, coaches and mentors had continually encouraged her to use.
“I was beginning to wonder: Was I squandering all of that so-called potential, or did I even have it to begin with?” she said.
To answer that question, DesJardin used an analogy from neurobiology. She described the development of neurons in the brain, explaining that they can mature only by making connections to other neurons. Through a process known as pruning, weaker neuron connections are dissolved, while stronger ones help a neuron perform optimally.
“Luckily,” she continued, “neither neurons nor people have to go at it alone. Thankfully, at Georgetown, I found a community of students, instructors and coaches who helped to direct my growth … Not only biology, but life itself, is characterized deeply by interdependence.”
DesJardin’s advice to her classmates to lean on their support networks in order to improve themselves and the world around them dovetailed with Fattahi’s theme of compassion. He related the story of his family, who sought political asylum in the United States after his father escaped from prison in Iran.
He emotionally recounted the trials of his family, before recognizing the Hilltop as a place where he has found safety and empathy.
“Georgetown has been my sanctuary. I have found that, here, compassion is everywhere. It is present when you, my classmates, dedicate your time to mentor underserved children in the District of Columbia. … It is present in the Jesuits’ commitment to the promotion of justice.”
Joseph Almeida (COL ’05) rounded out the convocation speakers by sharing some of the life lessons he has learned as a grade school teacher, with Teach for America and as a teacher in a Manhattan charter school. In true teacher form, he presented his core message in easy-to-remember tips, complete with hand motions, that he hopes graduates will carry with them going forward.
Almeida advised the seniors to develop strong relationships, to be honest, to find a hobby and to not fear failure.
DesJardin tasked her fellow seniors with similar adages in her closing remarks.
“Our challenge is strong, but so is our potential.”

When Sharon VanDyke’s son Matthew called to say he was booking a flight to Libya, she was out buying batteries. Though the decision to head to a country mired in civil war may have prompted most mothers to give it a second thought, Sharon knew her son.
But now with Matthew (GRD ’04) missing for over 60 days, his single mother and his girlfriend of five years, Lauren Fischer (SFS ’07), are facing a hard reality.
“I think the biggest frustration is not knowing where he is and what condition he’s in. Is he OK? Have they tortured him? Is he getting food?” said Sharon, who has conducted a weeks-long search with Lauren to no avail.
Matthew, a jack of all trades who dabbled in freelance journalism, left for Benghazi, Libya on February 26 shortly after the civil war there had begun. Although the U.S. State Department had issued a travel advisory for Libya the day before, Matthew was unconcerned about the dangers, according to Sharon. He thought that Gaddafi would be ousted in a week so that by the time he arrived, the fighting would have ended. Secondly, he believed that government forces would never reach far enough east of Tripoli to hit Benghazi.
He was wrong on both counts.
After about a month of steady contact, on March 12 Matthew let his family know he was headed to Brega. That was the last they heard from him. On March 15, Gaddafi’s forces took the city with force and captured some 1000 to 1200 Libyan rebels, bringing the prisoners back to Surt. While Matthew is assumed to be among the prisoners, this has yet to be confirmed.
“We would just like to know if he’s OK. We’d like to have him home, but I’m not even pushing that right now,” Sharon explained.
Wrong Place, Wrong Time
The Georgetown grad never sought to end up in the middle of a fight. According to his mother and girlfriend, he sincerely doubted the violence would last for more than a week or two. He wanted to witness the reconstruction, not the revolt.
After weeks of turmoil, his friends in Libya kept asking him why the Americans were not aiding the rebels.
“He felt he was one American who could possibly help,” his mother Sharon said. According to her, he was looking to help establish a new democracy and possibly found a think tank.
“He wanted to be able to help them create something in the government. He wanted to help in any way that he could. And he wanted to write about it,” his girlfriend Lauren said.
Matthew promised he would leave if the fighting reached the East. He and Lauren talked contingency plans, but never with any pressing concern.
“It was always ‘if something happens … but it won’t,'” Lauren said, her voice quivering.
Sharon and Lauren rarely worried about him overseas because he promised to carry a GPS tracking device and check in frequently. But after the last check-in message was sent on March 13, they started to wonder. Still, a few days incommunicado were normal in the war-torn country.
“The first ten days we didn’t hear from him, we weren’t worried because we knew Internet was down and cell phone service was down. We figured he was alright,” Sharon said.
But his family’s fears were confirmed when on March 22 a man with an Arabic accent called Sharon at home from Matthew’s cell phone. She tried to ask him where Matthew was and if he was safe, but to no avail.
Sharon continued to call her son’s phone 20 or 30 times a day without answer. The one connection she was able to make was hardly comforting. According to her, this man also had a Middle Eastern accent and may have been the same man as before. He insisted that she had the wrong number as she tried to explain the situation. The call ended, but not before she received one good wish.
“I hope you find your son,” the man said, and then the phone went dead.
Risky Business
Matthew had never shied from extreme situations. A lifetime resident of Baltimore, he graduated from the University of Maryland Baltimore County in 2002 with a 4.0 grade-point average. In 2004, he earned a master’s degree in security studies from Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service. During his time on the Hilltop, he wrote a column for The Hoya and disc jockeyed a radio show on WGTB. After he finished his academic career, he set off to see the world first-hand.
He first went to Spain, where he met Lauren while she was teaching English there. Despite their overlapping time on the Hilltop, they had never met. Shortly after, he began a four-year motorcycle journey across the Middle East and North Africa, with periodic returns home.
“I knew what I was signing up for,” Lauren said of their relationship, although she would rather he not use a motorcycle.
He slept everywhere from rooftops to luxury mansions as he made friends in every country he passed through. More than once he was detained by border patrols, but he was always set free soon after.
“Camping for him was a Holiday Inn,” quipped Sharon.
He spent years writing and filming his experiences during his travels, sometimes acting as a freelance journalist. He was working on a book when he decided to travel to Libya. Though he had wanted to stay home for a year and sort through his notes and footage, Matthew felt drawn to the mounting tension in the North African country.
“We talked pretty seriously about him going to Cairo when that situation started there. But in the end he decided he didn’t have the same close friends there,” Lauren said. “He loved Libya … He always talked about how much he enjoyed his time there.”
Sharon said she has always been supportive of her son’s unconventional lifestyle.
“You have to give them the tools to move on,” she said.
On his public Facebook profile reads the statement: “I live my life for what they’ll write on my tombstone.”
Keeping the Faith
With no confirmed details, no leads and no connections, Sharon and Lauren have not given up. They have contacted over 50 networks, from Amnesty International to the Red Cross. Sharon just returned this week from a trip to the U.S. embassy in Turkey, which is the designated hub for all American affairs in Libya now that the United States has no official presence in the country currently.
She has also had pictures posted in the media center in Benghazi to reach other journalists as Matthew had press credentials with him in Libya from a previous stint as a journalist in Afghanistan.
Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming at Georgetown has helped get the word to the State Department and the university is lending its weight, but Matthew remains missing without a trace.
Sharon said that she has not let the worst even cross her mind.
“I’ve never believed that he was dead. I’ve never thought that,” she said.
She continues to inundate every available information channel in the hopes that someone down the line will be able to find her only son. Still the clock is ticking.
“The longer it goes, the less people’s focus in on Libya, the less people’s focus is on him. But it hasn’t gone away for us,” she said.
Correction: This article originally stated Matthew VanDyke received a MSFS degree from the SFS. He, in fact, received a master’s degree in security studies.

Vice President for Public Affairs
Erik Smulson (COL ’89) will take over as the vice president for public affairs and senior adviser to the president this month, taking over the job after Julie Bataille left this spring to work for the Obama administration.
Smulson, who served as the chief of staff to President John J. DeGioia since 2007 and assistant vice president of communications from 2005 to 2007, will direct the external relations, federal relations and protocol and events for the Georgetown office of communications.
“I am deeply grateful to Erik for his dedicated and very effective service as chief of staff over the past four years,” DeGioia said in a press release. “Erik has helped coordinate a wide range of issues during this time.”
Smulson said he was excited to tackle the challenges the new appointment would bring after his experience working for DeGioia.
“My work in the President’s office these past years has really allowed me to
have an understanding of the big picture and how the university works,” he said.
“On any day, the issues are different and they are always interesting and important. This experience has challenged me and prepared me for my new role.”
Smulson said that while he never saw himself taking on such a role in his days as an undergrad, he was excited to serve the community in this position.
“Georgetown has been such an important part of my life, it is truly an honor to continue to be part of the community in this way,” he said. “When I was a student
I never imagined I would be back serving the university in this way.”
Chief of Staff
Joe Ferrara was appointed chief of staff to University President John J. DeGioia on July 1, following Smulson’s appointment as vice president for public affairs.
“I am truly grateful to both Erik and Joe for their service to the university and I look forward to their continued contributions in these new roles,” DeGioia said in a press release.
Ferrara is currently associate dean of the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, having served in that capacity since 2008. Previously he headed the institute’s master of policy management program from 2002 to 2008.
“This is a bittersweet moment for me,” Ferrara said in an email. “I have really enjoyed my time at GPPI, where there is a wonderful community of faculty, staff, students and alumni.”
Nonetheless, Ferrara said he was excited to take on a different kind of role.
“The biggest change is that I will be working on university-wide initiatives, as opposed to being focused mostly on just one academic unit,” he said. “I’ve already had some opportunities to work on cross-cutting initiatives at Georgetown and I look forward to engaging with my colleagues in this important work.”
Ferrara will manage the Office of the President in his new position, as well as move forward on projects and events that encompass the university as a whole.
“I am looking forward to helping President DeGioia as he continues to lead Georgetown, said Ferrara. “I think the president has a very compelling strategic vision for the university and I am excited about doing everything I can to help him realize that vision.”
Director of Protestant Chaplaincy
Reverend Bryant Oskvig, an ordained elder in the Methodist Church, will serve as the director of Georgetown’s Protestant chaplaincy in the fall.
Oskvig, who served as part-time interim director for the ministry during the past school year and has been working with the ministry for more than five years, will join the university full-time after he finishes his term at the Linden-Linthicum United Methodist Church in Maryland. Although he said it was a heart-wrenching decision to leave his current parish, Oskvig said he was excited to spend more time at Georgetown.
“My affection and love for Georgetown have grown over the years,” he said. “I’m already familiar with the community; I’ve already started building those relationships.”
As director of the Protestant chaplaincy, Oskvig will be responsible for leading Protestant worship services and Bible studies, organizing programs, coordinating with nearby Protestant churches and working with student groups.
“I hope that students feel welcome to come knock on my door,” he said.
He added that one of his goals is to develop a program that would create an opportunity for student reflection on their experiences.
Oskvig, who was chosen for the position after a year-long, nation-wide search by the Office of Mission and Ministry, said his diversity of experience has prepared him well for his job. He has served as a minister in a variety of settings and has worked on both interfaith and interethnic dialogues.
Oskvig will also oversee programs stemming from a wide range of beliefs and religious traditions.
“The challenge is sort of how to hold these diverse groups together,” he said. “Instead of a cacophony of noise, a symphony playing a melody.”
Director of the Doctor of Liberal Studies
The School of Continuing Studies announced the appointment of Francis J. Ambrosio as director of the doctor of liberal studies program on Monday.
“Frank will be both a model and a guide to our doctoral candidates in a program that has now established itself not only as the unique but also as the exemplary doctoral program for liberal studies in the academic world,” SCS Dean Robert Manuel said in a press release.
Ambrosio served as the interim director of the program, which focuses on a broad sampling of the humanities, during the 2010-2011 academic year. He helped institute the liberal studies doctoral program, the first of its kind in the United States and Canada, six years ago. He has been involved with the executive committee that manages doctoral studies as well as the program’s admission committee and is proud of its successful development.
“It’s unique in that it is a doctorate degree that is designed to be a fully interdisciplinary degree. That’s what makes liberal studies distinctive,” he said. “Because it is the first program of this sort, we are very eager and committed to make sure that the people who complete this degree approach the program with academic seriousness and the appropriate level of rigor.”
As director, he hopes to further attract and stimulate candidates who want to pursue leadership and public service.
Ambrosio was chosen for the position based on his experience with the doctoral program, and his interdisciplinary research and teaching credentials according to Manuel.
As interim director, Ambrosio transformed the position from a part-time to a full-time occupation. Despite the additional commitment, he will continue to be an associate professor of philosophy and teach “The Challenge of Post-Modernism,” a required course for the doctor of liberal studies program.
Ambrosio is a highly acclaimed professor on campus as a recipient of the Dorothy Brown Award for Teaching by popular student vote in 2009 and the Excellence in Teaching Faculty Award from the Georgetown graduate liberal studies program in 2010.

Wireless service providers will be able to send emergency text messages to cell phones during disasters through a new alert system set to launch in the District by the spring of next year.
The Personal Localized Alerting Network, established by the Federal Communications Commission in conjunction with several other federal agencies, will use a variety of mediums to notify participants of national and local emergencies.
University officials hope that PLAN can supplement Georgetown’s current emergency alert system, Hoya Alert.
“Our emergency response team continually reviews new tools for monitoring safety concerns,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh wrote in an email. “[We] will consider how this program could supplement our existing best practices in emergency communication.”
The PLAN service was approved by Congress in 2006 under the Warning, Alert and Response Network Act after a growing number of politicians became concerned about the best way to keep citizens informed in case of a crisis. Under the new system, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will be able to receive and aggregate alerts from the president, the National Weather Service and other federal and local emergency operations centers. The service will then send them on to wireless providers and public television stations to be broadcasted to the public. The aggregating alerts process will try to prevent network congestion during cases of emergency.
“Communications technology — and in particular mobile broadband — has the potential to revolutionize emergency response,” FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said in a press release.” Our communications networks need to be reliable and resilient in times of emergency. The FCC is working with carriers to ensure that they are.”
Participants can expect to receive three kinds of alerts: presidential alerts relating to terrorist attacks or other national emergencies, imminent threat alerts regarding weather emergencies where life or property is at risk and child abduction emergency alerts.
The alerts will also be geographically targeted. According to the FEMA website, a New York resident who was not in the area at the time of the event would not receive an alert, while a tourist who was visiting the city would.
PLAN is free, and wireless customers will be signed up automatically when their service provider opts in. Major carriers, including AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon have already adopted the service, allowing them to implement it in New York before the end of the year. All carriers are expected to participate in the service by April 2012.
The new system follows recent trend of text message communication between local and federal government officials and their constituents. D.C. residents can receive text message alerts from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority regarding disruptions in service, and in 2008, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama announced his selection of vice presidential candidate via text message.
“We need to adapt to what the public is using and not make it fit traditional systems,” FEMA administrator Craig Fugate said at a press conference last week.

An anonymous donor pair described as a “parent couple” have agreed to match senior donations to the Class of 2011 Fund, raising the total to $116,892 according to an email from the co-chairs.
Continuing an upward trend of seniors giving back, before the matching agreement the fund had raised $58,446, a record high in the last 10 years with over 71 percent of the senior class donating. The total exceeds last year’s figure by over $25,000; the Class of 2010 Fund had earned $32,157 by convocation. Last year, about 66 percent of seniors gave back to the university through the fund.
Kirsten Hardy, co-chair of the Class of 2011 Fund, attributes the rise to a growing number of students realizing that they can selectively donate to individual departments, clubs, teams and other groups that have shaped their Georgetown experience.
“By personalizing their gifts, seniors and alums are able to make a gift to the part of the university that has had the greatest impact on them. That gift is then allocated to the specified area immediately,” Hardy said in an email. “Wherever a student makes a gift, that area of Georgetown will see the money right away.”
The groups that got the most student support are the Athletics Excellence Fund, Campus Ministry, and specific academic majors and sports teams, according to Ben Jarrett, associate director of development in the Office of Advancement.
Since 2008, seniors have been able to make personalized gifts as well as give to the Georgetown Fund, which supports the 1789 Scholarship Imperative. According to Jarrett, 71 percent of seniors chose to give to the Georgetown Fund.
Jarrett said that the giving to the class fund will hopefully be just the first step for soon-to-be-alumni in their efforts to give back.
“This year’s class had over 1,000 donors, surpassing the Class of 2010,” he said in an email. “We feel that seniors will leave with a better understanding of the benefits of engaging with the Georgetown University Alumni Association and we hope that these gifts mark the beginning of a meaningful philanthropic relationship with Georgetown.”
Jarrett praised the efforts of the Class of 2011 Fund Committee in ensuring that their peers understood the importance of giving back. According to Hardy, the committee planned events such as Careertoberfest, senior socials at The Tombs and alumni networking events to expose seniors to the resources available to them as young alumni. Fund Co-chair Quinn Portfolio (COL ’11) added that alumni gifts were important in order for the university to sustain and expand these resources.
“I was excited to be a part of the Class of 2011 Fund Committee because I wanted to lead the effort to educate students on the importance of giving back to an alma mater that given us so much and the direct impact they can have on the future of the university,” she said in an email.
