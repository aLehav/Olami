Recent Georgetown graduate and former White House adviser Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson (SFS ’14) announced her bid for the House of Representatives last October, just over three years after she graduated.
If elected, Johnson, 26, would be the youngest woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress and the first African-American woman to represent the 4th District. She is running in the Democratic primary against another Georgetown alumnus, U.S. Army veteran George Scott (SFS ’84). The winner will face incumbent Scott Perry (R-Pa.), who was re-elected in 2016 by a two-to-one margin.
Scott’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for an interview.
Johnson’s first exposure to politics began in her grandparents’ household. After growing up during the era of segregation and receiving limited education, her grandparents stressed the importance of participating in national politics. From the moment that she turned 18, Johnson felt an obligation to take an active role in politics.
Although an interest in politics had been ingrained in her, Johnson said in interview with The Hoya that she was unsure of how to make politics a part of her future. It was not until Johnson attended Georgetown and pursued an internship with Sen. Robert Casey (D-Pa.) during her sophomore year that her political career began to form.
“I never expected to go to college, so once I did end up going to college, and I did meet Senator Casey, it just took off from there,” Johnson said. “You actually got an in-depth experience rather than just doing the general administrative tasks.”
Following graduation, Johnson joined Casey’s office as a full-time senior staff assistant. After a year, Johnson received a phone call inviting her to a position in the administration of former President Barack Obama. She served as the assistant and adviser to then-director of the Office of Management and Budget Shaun Donovan.
“Going from a foster house to the White House was something I never expected,” Johnson said. “You don’t really see that in your life when you’re sharing one bed with three different girls, and now, you’re the right hand to the guy in charge of $4.1 trillion.”
Johnson cites her time at the White House as an opportunity where she further developed her passion for the representation of all people, a value she developed during her work in Obama’s administration.
Johnson’s engagement with a diverse group of people began during her four years at Georgetown. She was involved with many cultural groups on campus, including some she did not identify with. Groups she was involved with include the Black Student Association, the Muslim Student Association and the Latino Society.
Her experiences allowed her to see past the judgments that she feels many people hold toward members of different ethnic groups, Johnson told The Hoya.
“One thing that I see in this world is that there’s a lot of fear of different types of people, but that fear is only fueled by ignorance,” Johnson said. “If you continue to be ignorant about people who don’t look like you, you’re going to always have that fear, and you’re going to perpetuate that fear for generations.”
Many of the initiatives that Johnson supports, such as improving and increasing the accessibility of government programs, stem from her personal experiences. A first-generation college student, Johnson grew up in a foster home until her grandparents were able to adopt her — thanks in part, according to Johnson, to Social Security.
“If my grandmother didn’t receive Social Security, she wouldn’t have been able to pay for me and raise me. I would still be living with my foster family,” Johnson said. “Just knowing how impactful government programs were for me, I want to make sure that people have access to them and that they’re better than they are now.”
Johnson hopes to represent the needs of her diverse constituency, according to Johnson’s campaign communication director, Christina Kauffman.
“The goal of her campaign is to be elected to the 4th congressional district so she can represent all people, pulling from her own experiences to shape policies and preserve opportunities for future generations,” Kauffman said.
Update (2/7): Read The Hoya’s interview with Corbin-Johnson’s opponent in the Democratic primary, Georgetown alumnus and army veteran George Scott.

Enough of this marshmallow fluff reporting.  Why doesn’t The Hoya write an article about notorious alumnus Peter Strzok and his wife Melissa Hodgman?  both Hoyas.

Student group GU Fossil Free delivered a letter to University President John J. DeGioia on Friday outlining its request for Georgetown to divest from tar sand oil companies.
“By investing in tar sand oil companies, Georgetown tacitly endorses and profits from a destructive, unjust industry,” the letter to DeGioia reads. “We call on you to join [the signatories], in favor of the proposal and assist in its passage by the Board of Directors so as to further align the Endowment Fund with our Jesuit values.”
The letter was delivered in advance of the spring reconvening of the Committee Investment and Social Responsibility, which advises the university on socially responsible investment policies. GUFF’s initial proposal was submitted to the committee in November 2017, at which time the proposal had garnered 200 signatures from members of the Georgetown community.
CISR committed in November to reviewing the proposal at its next meeting, which is expected to occur in March.
Celia Buckman (SFS ’21), a member of GUFF, said now is an important time for DeGioia to hear GUFF’s message.
“We think that it’s important for President DeGioia to get our message now because we’re expecting CISR, the committee that reviews the proposal, to have a vote around March, so getting that kind of institutional pressure on CISR to support and represent the interests of the majority of students of at Georgetown as well as coming from the top of the administration,” Buckman said.
GUFF also wanted to highlight the diversity of student support it has received since the proposal was submitted in November, according to Buckman.
The petition now has 326 signatories — including Georgetown students, alumni, faculty and staff — as well as 13 student organizations, including Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network and the Georgetown Solidarity Committee.
The letter reiterates the main points of GUFF’s November proposal. In particular, it highlights the environmental harm presented by tar sand oil extraction, which is significantly more severe than other types of oil extraction. GUFF argues that refusing to divest from tar sands oil extraction would violate the Socially Responsible Investment Policy approved by the board of directors last June.
“The University shall use reasonable efforts to avoid investments in companies that have demonstrated records of widespread violations of human dignity. As examples, this includes companies that are directly and significantly involved in the production of weapons that are intended to be used for indiscriminate destruction and companies that are engaged in activities having an extremely deleterious effect on the environment,” the policy states.
Georgetown’s continued investment in fossil fuels is counter to its identity as a conscientious and progressive institution, Samantha Panchèvre (SFS ’19), a GUFF member, told The Hoya in a November interview.
“Georgetown is educating its students to be leaders in the world, to fight for a better political and social environment and climate change is throwing all of that into disarray. So, by funding climate change, it’s very counterintuitive for an institution like Georgetown to fund climate change and also tell its students to go out and fight climate change,” Panchèvre said.
Rachel Pugh, the university’s senior director for strategic communications, said the proposal has remained at the initial stages of the approval process since November.
“Georgetown’s Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility (CISR) received GU Fossil Free’s proposal last November. CISR had a preliminary discussion about this proposal at its November meeting. CISR will meet again in the next few weeks to continue its review of this proposal,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
If it receives approval from the CISR, GUFF’s proposal will move to the Committee on Finance and Administration within the board of directors for further consideration.
Although GUFF members acknowledge the process is going slowly, they have not expressed concern about its current pace.
“It’s following a timeline we kind of expected,” Buckman said.

Two students from the Georgetown University Student Association’s federal and D.C. relations committee collected 198 signatures from university student body presidents across the United States in support for a response letter to the recent changes made to Title IX, a law that protects individuals from discrimination and dictates the proceedings for sexual assault and misconduct cases.
Chas Newman (MSB ’18) and Casey Doherty (COL ’20) contacted 2,200 universities nationally to solicit support for their unified response addressing Betsy DeVos, the U.S. secretary of education, and the recently implemented guidelines.
In September 2017, the Department of Education released new Title IX guidelines, allowing universities to set their own standards for evidence in misconduct investigations, pursue informal resolutions such as mediation and to establish an appeals process for disciplinary sanctions. These guidelines also allow universities to extend the time frame for proceedings indefinitely.
Many opponents of these new guidelines feel that they are protective of the accused rather than the survivor. In response, Newman and Doherty led a joint effort with 198 colleges and universities nationwide to urge DeVos to revert to the Obama administration’s guidelines, which outlined explicit guidelines for how universities should handle sexual assault and misconduct cases.
The changes come at a time when many U.S. college campuses report suffering from high rates of sexual assault. One in five women and one in 16 men will be sexually assaulted on their college campuses, and more than 90 percent of sexual assault victims on college campuses will not report the assault, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.
Sent on Dec. 4 to both the secretary of education and to the Office of Civil Rights, the one-page letter outlines student concerns with the increased burden of proof on the victim, which student leaders believe will cause an unwillingness to begin investigations in future assault and misconduct cases. The letter urges DeVos to reaffirm her commitment to keeping college campuses safe and calls for guidelines that hold college administrators accountable for sexual violence on campus.
“Without clear, unwavering commitment from elected officials and government leaders, yourself chief among them, it will be too easy for school administrators to prioritize the avoidance of bad publicity over holding perpetrators responsible for their actions,” the letter reads.
The letter includes 10 pages of signatures from all the student body representatives from colleges supporting Doherty and Newman’s initiative. Student body presidents from Columbia University, Tufts University, Stanford University and Tulane University signed onto the letter.
Newman received a response from the Office of Civil Rights on Dec. 11. The response directed him to the original document for the changed guidelines of Title IX, along with an informational link for “anyone who believes that a recipient institution has engaged in sex discrimination.”
Both students plan to reopen this conversation in March during this year’s “notice and comment” period, which is dedicated to allowing interested parties to submit written comments either supporting or opposing the proposed regulation.
“We want people to know that students’ voices do matter and just because you’re not donating to a political campaign, or super old, you do have a voice,” Doherty said. “[We want] an awareness that these things are happening and we feel like we can do something to make it better.”
Doherty said the initiative was intentionally student-led.
“What we wanted to do was have it be solely students. So that was a concerted effort to keep it at the student body level,” Doherty said.
Newman said they felt that the letter would carry more weight without involvement from university administrators.
“We think it’s a more powerful narrative, and we found that it was quite successful: students working for students at a national level,” Newman said.
Both students voiced their disappointment in the response they received.
“We went to great lengths to not necessarily make this a partisan issue,” Newman said. “We want a dialogue, not a diatribe or a manifesto.”
Doherty said while Georgetown University has stated its commitment to maintaining the Obama administration’s guidelines for sexual misconduct, many other schools may not have the ability or the willingness to do the same.
“It’s important to us and our friends and students across the country,” Doherty said.

The one-in-five figure is almost certainly too high. This could be learned by visiting the relevant Wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_sexual_assault#Prevalence_and_incidence_of_rape_and_other_sexual_assault
Moreover, sexual assault has declined considerably over the past couple of decades.
Any sexual assault is too much, but citing erroneously high statistics does nothing except stoke fear.

And leaving a comment like this does nothing except take away from the amazing efforts that these young people are making in helping create a better and safer campus environment.

I disagree. Exaggerating the problem will foment backlash.
An example: why won’t parents let their kids play outside anymore? Parents who do so at best are labeled as having “free range children;” at worst, they’re arrested for negligence. Yet the streets are infinitely safer than they were 20 years ago.  This situation emerged  in part because people exaggerated crime rates.
Moreover, the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter was an insult to victims of sexual assault. It didn’t make campuses safer. I made this point in a recent article:
https://www.jamesgmartin.center/2018/01/title-ix-insult-victims-sexual-assault/
By the way, this isn’t a political objection: I’m a lifelong progressive who happily voted for Obama twice.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is set to speak in Gaston Hall on Feb. 5 to present the annual Hillary Rodham Clinton Awards for Advancing Women in Peace and Security to Nadia Murad, a former captive of the Islamic State group, and Wai Wai Nu, a Rohingya activist.
Clinton will also present a second award, the Global Trailblazer Award, to BBC international correspondent Lyse Doucet for her coverage of the impacts of war in Africa and the Middle East on women and children.
The HRC awards recognize exceptional individuals who advance women’s role in peace-making efforts. The award is sponsored by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security in the name of Clinton, the honorary founding chair of GIWPS.
Murad, the first Goodwill ambassador for the dignity of survivors of human trafficking for the United Nations, was one of thousands of Yazidi women who were captured and enslaved by the Islamic State group in Iraq.
After suffering significant sexual abuse in IS captivity, Murad has since campaigned for recognition of the plight of Yazidis, a Kurdish religious minority group, ultimately bringing the problem of human trafficking to the U.N. Security Council. Murad was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016.
Nu, a member of the persecuted Rohingya people, was one of many political prisoners in Myanmar. She was freed in 2012 and later pursued a law degree and founded two nongovernmental organizations aimed at empowering Myanmar’s youth: Women’s Peace Network-Arakan and Justice for Women. The NGOs seek to provide legal education to Myanmar’s youth and to teach women how to prevent and combat domestic abuse and sexual abuse. In 2015, Nu launched an online anti-hate speech campaign with the hashtag #MyFriend.
Clinton launched GIWPS in 2011 in partnership with Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia as a part of former President Barack Obama’s U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security. GIWPS promotes global stability and women’s rights through the engagement of women in conflict prevention and issues such as climate change. The institute is currently run by former U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women’s Issues Melanne Verveer.
Clinton’s planned speech marks her second appearance at Georgetown in two years. Clinton also presented her namesake award at last year’s ceremony, delivering a speech calling for increased diplomacy and protection of women’s rights worldwide.
Last year’s recipients were four activists and leaders who pushed for the inclusion of women in the Colombian government’s 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia insurgency movement. The recipients were former Vice President of Colombia and lead negotiator Humberto de la Calle, Colombia Deputy Attorney General Maria Paulina Riveros, Colombia Office of the High Commissioner for Peace Thematic Director Elena Ambrosi and journalist Jineth Bedoya, who advocates against sexual violence.

Students are set to vote Feb. 22 on a campuswide referendum that proposes reforms to the Georgetown University Student Association senate, including proposals to elect senators by class year instead of by geographic districts and to move elections for nonfreshman senators to April instead of the fall.
The referendum consists of two questions, the first regarding the proposed reforms to the senate. The second question seeks to codify several protections for student participation in GUSA,  including protections for citizenship, gender identity or expression, ability or disability and any characteristics protected under federal or Washington, D.C. law. The Code of Student Conduct and the Student Organization Standards include similar protections, but the referendum poses to revise the language in the GUSA Constitution.
To pass, the referendum needs a two-thirds margin of support and the support of at least 25 percent of the student body overall. The GUSA Election Commission plans to publicize the referendum and administer voting through HoyaLink, according to GUSA Election Commissioner Grady Willard (SFS ’18).
A bill to put the referendum on the ballot passed with 23 senators voting in favor of the bill, two voting against and one abstaining.
The referendum is largely identical to one held last spring, which failed to pass because it did not reach the voting threshold. GUSA Senate Speaker Ben Baldwin (SFS ’19) anticipates higher rates of student voting this year, as the referendum is set to take place on the same day as the GUSA executive election rather than over a three-day period.
Last spring’s referendum came on the heels of a December 2016 referendum to dramatically restructure GUSA’s legislative body, which received enough votes to pass but was invalidated by the GUSA Constitutional Council.
The new system would better serve the student body, because students’ interests more closely align with their class year rather than where they live, according to Baldwin.
“The issues that a sophomore or junior face have more to do with major selection, meal plans, their academic futures, or any number of other issues regardless of whether they live in McCarthy or Alumni Square,” Baldwin wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Class-based elections would also improve senators’ accountability to constituents, according to Baldwin.
“Frankly, under our current system, Senators are not accountable to the students they represent because they most likely will not be living in the same geographic district for more than one year and students cannot vote a second time on whether their Senator fulfilled their promises,” Baldwin wrote.
GUSA senators Sean Lerner (SFS ’20) and Nick Zeffiro (SFS ’18) opposed the bill to hold the referendum.
“If there were any lessons learned from last year’s GUSA Senate, it was that reorganizing referendums are a potentially embarrassing waste of time,” Lerner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I came into the year confident that this year’s GUSA Senate would be able to achieve real goals, and that senators would keep their promise of ‘no more referendums’ that many came into the year with. Clearly, this didn’t happen.”
Zeffiro said he opposed the referendum because his constituents, off-campus students, are more interested in social change on campus rather than electoral reform.
“Consider my nay more of a symbolic gesture that GUSA should be spending more of its time on enacting change and social progress on campus (issues seniors care about), and less time on constitutional referendums to modify election districts and timelines (issues seniors do not care about),” Zeffiro wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Electoral scheduling changes for the senate would foster better cooperation between the senate and the GUSA executive, GUSA Senate Vice Speaker Sylvia Levy (SFS ’18) said.
“Moving the majority of Senate elections to April will increase cohesion between the Executive branch and the Senate — members of both will be able to closely work with one another starting over the summer and through the academic year,” Levy wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Some senators initially expressed concern about isolating freshmen elections, according to GUSA Senator Madison Alvarez (SFS ’21). However Alvarez said mentorship between senators would facilitate the transition should the referendum pass.
“A lot of people are new. Between that and the fact that everybody bonds really quickly, we decided it would be worth it to have the upperclassmen start planning over the summer,” Alvarez said. “As long as the upperclassmen step up and mentor the freshmen, it really shouldn’t be a disconnect between these two groups.”
Levy said changes to the senate election cycle will create a more inclusive environment.
“The stress of the month of September prevents students who would otherwise have considered running for GUSA Senate from doing so,” Levy wrote. “If this referendum succeeds, it will give students much more time to prepare for elections, and it will give GUSA itself more time to reach out to members of different communities on campus that are historically disconnected from student government and encourage them to run.”
Baldwin said these changes would result in a more representative, accountable and hard-working senate.
“I want to see a system that rewards Senators for the work they accomplish and removes those that either contribute little or participate in the Senate to pad their resumes,” Baldwin wrote. “I know the student body is frustrated with what they perceive as an ineffective, wasteful, or petty body, so I hope that they vote to change the system.”≠

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority launched its Rush Hour Promise program Friday, a new initiative that will credit customers for delays of 15 minutes or more.
Just three days into the program, Metro is set to credit a total of 2,262 customers — or about 0.1 percent of its daily 200,000 riders — for delayed trips. Around 90 percent of riders reach their destinations on time, according to an April WMATA news release.
The Rush Hour Promise concludes the Railcar Get Well plan, which was meant to reduce passenger offloads and delays by the end of 2017, and was also part of Metro’s “Back2Good” campaign, which aims to improve the Metro system’s all-around quality, from safety to reliability.
The Rush Hour Promise comes after over a year of improvements on the Metrorail system. In June 2016, WMATA launched its SafeTrack program to repair parts of the ailing Metrorail system and increase safety and reliability.
In addition to repairing tracks, Metro is retiring older 5000-series train cars and replacing them with newer 7000-series cars. In a news release, WMATA said its maintenance programs, new trains and improved infrastructure are contributing to fewer delays.
“The service guarantee comes at a time of improved reliability, demonstrating Metro’s progress getting ‘back to good,’” according to a Jan. 25 news release.
Despite a derailment on the Red line in January, Metro expressed confidence in its ability to deliver safe and reliable service.
“Our #back2good initiative promised to deliver a fleet of new trains and improve reliability in 2017. Based on our progress, we’re making another promise in 2018 – the Rush Hour Promise. So along with being more reliable, #wmata is more accountable,” WMATA wrote in a Jan. 29 tweet.
The refunds only apply to trips during rush hour service, or from 5 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays. Metro SmarTrip cardholders will automatically receive credit for delayed MetroRail trips while MetroBus customers must request credit through an online form. Customers can only receive four credits per calendar month through the Rush Hour Promise.
The Rush Hour Promise does not apply to delays caused by weather, extraordinary circumstances like security emergencies or blackouts or repair work that the customer is notified of in advance. It does not apply to U-Pass or Kids Ride Free Passes. SelectPass, One Day and Seven Day passes will receive a $3 credit for MetroRail delays and $1 credit for MetroBus delays.
Metro is using a program called MyTripTime to measure the duration of customers’ trips, taking into account the times of getting to the train, waiting on the platform, transfers and the walk to the exit in its estimate.
Metro estimates that 0.3 percent of trips will qualify for credits and that the Rush Hour Promise will cost between $2 million and $3.5 million per year, according to The Washington Post.
WMATA CEO Paul Wiedefeld said that the Rush Hour Promise expresses WMATA’s commitment to improved service, according to the Jan. 25 news release.
“Rush Hour Promise is our commitment to riders that we are accountable for providing reliable, on-time service,” Wiedefeld said at a Jan. 25 news conference. “We want our customers to know that we value their time, and we’re going to do everything we can to keep them moving safely and efficiently.”
