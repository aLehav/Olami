The Georgetown University Police Department and Georgetown University Student Association launched a pilot program for on-campus student safety escorts and enhanced SafeRides service in order to decrease wait times April 18.
The Student Safety Escort Pilot Program is set to provide on-campus, point-to-point student safety escorts seven nights a week from 8 p.m. to midnight using trained student guards.
The expanded SafeRides service will include an additional vehicle Monday and Sunday nights, the two busiest nights, according to GUPD Chief Gruber. The program plans to expand in the fall with additional vehicles five days a week, from Sunday to Thursday night.
The plans for the pilot program began due to feedback from the Georgetown University Student Association and the Student Safety Advisory Board, which meets every two weeks with GUPD Chief Officer Jay Gruber.
Gruber said student’s safety concerns were incorporated when developing the pilot program.
“I spent a lot of time with my Student Safety Advisory Board and the GUSA leadership, and I worked with them to try and understand the needs of the students, what their concerns were about SafeRides and their concerns about students walking across campus, and I really took to heart what they were talking about,” Gruber said.
GUPD launched two pilot programs this semester to increase SafeRides service and train student guards to escort other students, according to Gruber.
“I made a decision to make two different programs which were both pilots this semester. One was to increase the availability of SafeRides, so this semester we did a pilot to have our student guards drive SafeRides vans on Sunday and Monday, our two busiest nights. And two weeks later we piloted a student guard escort program based on the feedback I had gotten,” Gruber said.
The student guard leadership selected certain students for both programs. These students received extra training and vetting as escorts and drivers.
Gruber said the inclusion of students in the programs will benefit the community.
“The students are trained and vetted, and so I saw this as a great ready pool of really good students that could expand in different ways and do so much more. I like the fact that students are serving students.
Nina Young (SFS ’19), GUSA Safety and Sexual Assault Policy Team chair, said the escort service could normalize a safer method of getting home late at night.
“I feel like the student pilot program is a great initiative because it provides an alternative to have people walking back home from parties with people they don’t know that well,” Young said. “If we make that normalized, there would be a lot less reason for you to leave a party with someone you don’t know.”
Young said one issue that influenced the creation of the program was the increasingly long wait times for SafeRides.
“One of the problems that we were having was that safe ride waits were much too long. Students would call a SafeRide and end up walking home alone,” Young said.
Gruber said the student guard SafeRides pilot program has been successful in its first weeks.
“So far, the student guard SafeRides has been a big success, especially in decreasing wait time for students. The student guard escort system is only a week old, so we don’t have a feel yet how that is going,” Gruber said.
The project will continue in the fall semester with the potential for further expansion and increased safety for students, according to Gruber.
Gruber urged all students to maximize their use of both programs.
“I think the student guard escort program and student guard SafeRides program are great ways to serve our students,” Gruber said. “I want students to take advantage of all of these programs. Students should not have to walk alone on or off campus, so I really encourage students to take advantage of these programs.”

Four of about 20 marijuana legalization demonstrators were arrested outside of the U.S. Capitol Building on Monday while protesting for Congress to legalize cannabis across the country and remove the substance from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency’s Schedule 1 list, which prohibits possession or use of the drug on any federal property.
U.S. Capitol Police arrested the protesters for smoking marijuana on federal property, a crime that carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison.
Organized by DCMJ, an organization that is pushing for the full legalization of cannabis use in Washington, D.C., the protest followed the April 20 arrest of eight pot advocates for smoking marijuana outside the Capitol building for smoking marijuana.
The demonstration featured prayers from Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and Rastafarian faith traditions. The veterans group Weed for Warriors, which supports the legalization of cannabis for the purpose of relieving emotional stress connected to military service, also had representatives present.
DCMJ urged supporters to protest despite potential arrests.
“We expect arrests to take place on Reschedule420 this year, but we know that our cause is just,” DCMJ wrote on its website. “We know that the best way to make America great again is not enforcing the outdated Controlled Substances Act, but providing Americans the liberty to choose cannabis for relaxation, enjoyment, and medicine.”
Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) signed a bill Feb. 26, 2015 making the possession and growth of marijuana legal for those over 21 years of age in the District. However, the purchase and sale of marijuana remains illegal under D.C. law. Smoking or consuming marijuana in public, including federal land, remains illegal.
Duke Dunn, a veteran, photographer and activist, said he has benefited from cannabis and hemp.
“Our farmers could grow it right here in America,” Dunn said. “Help our farmers, help our economy. For farming, it’s a miracle crop all the way around for the people, for the government, the economy, and the land and the air.”
Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in a White House press briefing Feb. 27 that President Donald Trump’s administration acknowledges a difference between medicinal and recreational cannabis use.
“There’s a big difference between that and recreational marijuana,” Spicer said in the briefing. “And I think that when you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing we should be doing is encouraging people. There is still a federal law that we need to abide by when it comes to recreational marijuana and other drugs of that nature.”
Using marijuana to improve mood or prevent symptoms of an illness proves its medicinal use, according to a DCMJ press release.
“We can argue that all cannabis use is medical,” DCMJ wrote. “If you use it to relax, that is medical. If you use it to put yourself into a better mood, that is medical. The argument that only some sick people can use cannabis while other adults are not sick enough to deserve it is deeply flawed. Many people use cannabis in order to not get sick.”
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rejected the concerns of pro-marijuana activists on the Trump administration’s views when he discussed the drug in his remarks on combatting violent crime to federal, state and local law enforcement March 15.
“I reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store.  And I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana. So people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another that’s only slightly less awful,” Sessions said.
Dunn said he does not see cannabis as a safety threat on par with heroin. He said he has been using marijuana for 45 years, but he did not become an outspoken supporter until five years ago when he saw a police officer wearing a shirt that said, “Cops want to legalize pot, ask me why.”
Dunn said the police officer’s answer started his activism.
“His answer was the benefit of our children, as well as us. So we don’t get in trouble for doing something less troublesome than alcohol,” Dunn said. “Alcohol kills people. Alcohol causes people to kill people. And alcohol makes you violent.”
Dunn said criminalizing marijuana brings severe consequences. He wore a dog tag to the rally with the number 22 on it to symbolize the average number of veterans who commit suicide a day. He said he believes that number would decrease with the legalization of cannabis.
Dunn said he also believes that minority arrests would decrease.
“It messes and wrecks up families, especially in the black community as well because they’re profiling them and it’s not right,” Dunn said.
Dunn encouraged people to call their representatives and ask them to support bills H.R. 1227 and H.R. 975, which would end the federal marijuana prohibition and respect state marijuana laws respectively.
“Our government is supposed to be a group that is set up to basically work and represent and help and support the people, but it’s turning against the people. I call it a self-serving, corrupt corporate government,” Dunn said.

Marijuana consumers deserve and demand equal rights and protections under our laws that are currently afforded to the drinkers of far more dangerous and deadly, yet perfectly legal, widely accepted, endlessly advertised and even glorified as an All American pastime, booze.
Plain and simple!
Legalize Marijuana Nationwide!

People smoke weed on federal property all the time without getting arrested and the fed even states they have no interest in prosecuting recreational users. These people were arrested for exercising their first amendment rights and thumbing their nose at the fed.

Tobacco is a known cause of cancer! Alcohol kills individuals, families, and innocent victims. Pot has it’s issues with lethargy, loss of ambition, and effects on IQ. However if a grown adult would rather smoke a little weed to feel happy and relieve stress it’s a whole lot better than dying of lung cancer or killing someone on the highway! I would much rather see a vet do a bong hit than go to the VA and get doped up on painkillers or anti depressants. People who want to smoke weed will get it either legally or illegally. Making it legal hurts criminal cartels more than society! You can argue about morality but it’s something that cannot be legislated.

The United States earned a C+ overall grade in the Newseum Institute’s inaugural First Amendment Report Card, which analyzed the state of the freedoms of religion, speech, press, assembly and petition.
The freedoms of assembly and petition received the highest grades, each earning a B-, while the freedoms of religion and speech each obtained a mark of C+. The panelists gave the freedom of the press the lowest grade: a C-.
Newseum Institute Chief Operating Officer Gene Policinski said these grades may be the results of a citizenry that has taken its First Amendment freedoms for granted, or that has defined these freedoms in narrow ways, according to a piece published on the Newseum’s “News and Commentary” section.
With respect to the freedom of the press, Policinski specifically cites surveys dating back to the 1990s that show growing public apprehension about whether the media continues to play a watchdog role.
Policinski also cites the resource dearth that many journalists and media employees now face.
Ken Paulson, the president of the Newseum Institute’s First Amendment Center, said the grades given in the First Amendment Report Card are likely related to the current administration’s expressed views on the media and press.
President Donald Trump recently announced he will not attend the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, making him the first sitting president in 36 years to miss the dinner. He has repeatedly attacked news organizations that report unfavorably about his administration, including CNN and The New York Times.
Most notably, Trump called the press the “enemy of the American people” in a Feb. 17 tweet, while Press Secretary Sean Spicer prevented journalists from The Times and other news organizations from attending an informal briefing on Feb. 24. White House Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon labelled the news media as “the opposition party” in a Jan. 25 interview with The New York Times.
“There are issues involving the president’s stance toward the news media that are of concern.  When you single out a free press as being ‘the enemy of the people,’ that’s going to have an unfortunate effect on both the news media and the public perception of the news media,” Paulson said in an interview with The Hoya.
Adjudicated by a panel of 15 First Amendment scholars, lawyers, journalists and activists, the rating, released April 20, reported a 2.39 average out of 5 after individually scoring the state of freedom of religion, speech, the press, assembly and petition based on legislation, executive orders, judicial decisions and public opinion during the past year.
 
The Newseum Institute serves as a branch of Washington, D.C.’s Newseum, a museum dedicated to documenting the history of the First Amendment in the United States, and works to promote, explain and defend individual liberties.
Georgetown School of Continuing Studies journalism professor Alan Bjerga said it is difficult to judge these ratings, due to the fact that this is the inaugural First Amendment Report Card.
“It’s tough to tell because it’s a first-time rating. You don’t know what it’s relative to,” Bjerga said in an interview with The Hoya. “C, B, that’s very subjective. I would say that being a journalist is not getting any easier.”
Bjerga said reporters face unique challenges today, especially as so-called “fake news” and misinformation spread on the internet and on radio.
“Journalists face the challenge of an environment where inaccurate information can be propagated very widely, while accurate, at times less sensational information may struggle to be heard or distributed as widely. At the same time, I think there is a rising appreciation of the necessity and the value of quality journalism,” Bjerga said.
Bjerga said he was optimistic about the future for press freedoms, saying journalists are rising to the challenge and determined to thrive in response to the current political climate.
Lata Nott, the executive director of the Newseum Institute’s First Amendment Center, reviewed the results, pointing out that while few A’s were awarded, no failing grades were given.
Nott said Americans need to be more conscious and watchful of problems related to the First Amendment.
“There’s a sense that our freedoms need to be watched carefully, that they’re threatened. There’s concerns about what might happen in the future. But at the same time, there was also a sense that these freedoms are resilient. As Americans, we do think that they’re important,” Nott said in an interview with The Hoya.
Nott said some problems, like the continuing lack of laws for protecting journalists and privacy, will persist during Trump’s administration.
“People are probably more worried about the First Amendment than they were before because the Trump administration has taken some action that have been contrary to the First Amendment,” Nott said. “There’s no federal shield law for reporters. They can be compelled to give up their sources or be jailed, when it comes to federal matters.  The thing is, that’s always been the case.”
Nott emphasized the importance of tracking the quality of the First Amendment freedoms and the importance of dialogue regarding these freedoms.
Paulson said he continues to hope the United States moves toward being a more free state.
“As a nation, we really need to remember that our strength comes not just from the freedom to speak. It’s also about the willingness to listen. We’re not making the most of our core freedoms when we are so polarized that we can’t benefit from each other’s ideas,” Paulson said. “That has to change, and that more than anything else would improve the report card for the First Amendment.”

President Donald Trump’s stated commitment to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict presents an opportunity for renewed negotiation between the two regions, according to two experts on the Middle Eastern dispute speaking Monday night.
The panel, convened by the Georgetown Bipartisan Pro-Israel Dialogue, featured former ambassador Dennis Ross, who has worked in multiple administrations as a key diplomat to Israel and Palestine, and Colin Kahl, former Vice President Joe Biden’s National Security Adviser and associate professor in the Security Studies Program at the School of Foreign Service, identified flaws in former President Barack Obama’s relations with Israel and urged Trump to inspire hope for a solution.
Ross said there was not any considerable progress toward Israeli-Palestinian peace in the Obama years, arguing that the Obama administration’s choice to make its objective to improve Israeli-Palestinian relations public was a key failure, especially negotiating Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Golan Heights in Syria.
Obama promoted a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine throughout his presidency, and increased foreign military funding for the Israeli military from $2.9 billion in 2011 to $ 3.1 billion in 2012, while former secretaries of state Hillary Clinton and John Kerry criticized settlements.
“One of the things that was done early was to declare that there had to be a big freeze, including on natural growth, on settling,” Ross said. “Had the administration framed that issue differently, talking about a limitation of settlement activity, it would have put itself in a different position.”
Kahl countered Ross, stressing the Obama administration’s close relationship with Israeli security networks.
“Where Obama doesn’t get enough credit was just the unbelievable depth of the security and intelligence relationship that Obama fostered with Israel,” Kahl said.
Kahl said factors beyond the Obama administration’s control spoiled potential for progress, like the difference between Obama’s and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s personalities. This clash of personalities made negotiations difficult.
“For Obama to really be able to effectively put pressure on Netanyahu, he had to establish a certain degree of credibility with the Israeli public, which he never did,” Kahl said.
Both Ross and Kahl agreed that the current state of Israeli-Palestinian relations is bleak. Most recently, the Israeli military and Gaza-based militant group Hamas fought a three-monthlong war that killed 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israelis. Israel continues to blockade Gaza and build settlements in the West Bank and Golan Heights.
“When you look at where the Israelis and the Palestinians are, I’ve worked on this issue for 30 years, and there has never been a lower level of belief on either side than there is today,” Ross said.
Looking forward, the speakers held that, despite their initial doubts on Trump’s commitment to policy issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the new administration has an opportunity to bring both sides together.
Trump tasked his son-in-law Jared Kushner in January with leading negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders and has suggested he supports a two-state solution, even after endorsing a one-state framework at a Feb. 15 press conference with Netanyahu.
“You might not have predicted that this would be an issue that’s important to President Trump,” Ross said.
Still, Kahl warned that Trump may not care personally about the issue, which may scuttle long-term commitment. He pointed to recent administration moves in the United Nations and the State Department to urge Netanyahu to reduce Israeli settlements as examples of this inconsistency between rhetoric and policy.
“Some of the groups furthest to the right inside Israeli politics were quite bullish on Trump, hoping that in essence it would be open season for establishing a greater Israel,” Kahl said. “Actually the Trump administration has done a number of things to walk that perception back. They’ve actually done a fairly mild brushback pitch on settlements, suggesting that it’s not helpful, Trump himself suggesting the Israelis will have to make compromises.”
Leaving hard policy aside, the two speakers concluded that the biggest problem holding back peace, and the one that the Trump administration must address if it wants to stabilize the area, is the disillusionment of the public.
“The biggest danger we have is the complete absence of hope,” Kahl said. “I think there needs to be some way for this administration to rejuvenate hope for the prospects of two states.”

American Indian populations continue to be adversely affected by the legacy of American colonialism, according to three Great Plains American Indians at a panel discussion on the historical injustices against American Indian peoples in the Intercultural Center Auditorium on Monday.
“Less than nine percent of the population of South Dakota identifies itself as American Indian, but yet nearly a third of the population of the state’s prisons identify themselves as being American Indians,” educator David Plume said.  “There are some disproportion issues there that have been going on for generations now.”
The panel, titled “Justice in America for Native Americans,” consisted of Plume, South Dakota counsel for the American Indian social advocacy group Lakota People’s Law Project, Chase Iron Eyes and public health physician Jeffrey Henderson. The panel was moderated by Marc Howard, director of the Prisons and Justice Initiative at Georgetown, which facilitates research on mass incarceration.
Bette Jacobs, professor in the Department of Health Systems Administration, which co-sponsored the event, said historical neglect is still having an effect on conditions for the American Indian population today.
“Our country is an ancient homeland for 567 federally recognized tribes of American Indians. Early encounters with Europeans who believed they had discovered a new land failed to recognize our homeland. This occupation became a systematic injustice that reverberates today,” Jacobs said.
Iron Eyes, a member of the Lakota Sioux Tribe in North Dakota, said the U.S. justice system has undermined the power of Indian nations in carrying out their own ideas of justice.
“It is a very real legal, political and economic oppression that results in certain limitations, certain usurpations of authority from the native nation, not only to enforce law and order according to its own terms, but to define law and order,” Iron Eyes said.
Iron Eyes said the negative impact of colonization hundreds of years ago is manifested in the living conditions of thousands of American Indians on Indian reservations.
“There is much to learn from communities that have been impacted by the processes of colonization and we are all trying to navigate this reality,” Iron Eyes said. “There is no reason that reservations should be the most horrible in terms of quality of life, suicide rates, substance abuse rates, poverty rates.”
Henderson, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, said federal rather than state oversight of law enforcement matters has resulted in strict punishment of American Indians on reservations.
“One of the big issues in South Dakota is that tribal concerns for any one of the tribes that are in the state of South Dakota have historically been passed off by our state as a federal problem. Under the federal government, there are mandatory sentencing guidelines, that many times are more harsh than what the state laws are,” Henderson said.
Henderson said the disproportionate incarceration of American Indians is a result of the federal jurisdiction on reservations.
“This past Friday, I was at the Pennington County Jail, and on that day they had 567 inmates.  Roughly 50 percent of the jail population on that day were American Indian. We represent about 10 to 12 percent of the population of Rapid City. However, 30 percent of those are federal inmates, and this speaks to jurisdictional issues,” Henderson said.
Plume said members were moving to provide education opportunities for children of American Indians, but financial difficulties are still unavoidable.
“What we try to do in Pine Ridge is make college opportunities affordable. The problem is many people come back to the reservation and they are faced with things such as restitutions and financial obligations for family,” Plume said.
Professor and Director of the Prisons and Justice Initiative Mark Howard called on Americans not to overlook American Indians in discussions of criminal and social justice.
“The burden falls disproportionately on minorities and peoples of color,” Howard said. “No issue or no group is more neglected in conversations about criminal justice and prisons than Native Americans, who are disproportionately over-represented in the criminal justice system.”
