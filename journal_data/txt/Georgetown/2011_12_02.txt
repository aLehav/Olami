Two students living just beyond the front gates reported seeing unknown suspects in their residences Friday night, according to a DPS Public Safety Alert.
In the first incident at 9:56 p.m., a student reported to the Department of Public Safety that an unknown male emerged from a closet while she was sitting in her living room in her house on the 1400 block of 36th Street. According to Metropolitan Police Department Officer Azaz Alali, the suspect was able to gain entry to the house through an unlocked back door. When the student asked what the suspect was doing there, he said that he was looking for a party and then ran out the back door in an unknown direction.
A little more than half an hour later, at 10:30 p.m., a student living on the 3600 block of O Street reported a similar incident to DPS. The student went into a bedroom to investigate a noise and saw an unknown person. The student screamed and the person fled down the stairs and out the back door.
DPS and MPD canvassed the area around both incidents but failed to find the suspects. Both cases are now being handled by MPD.
The suspect in the first incident is described in the PSA as a black male in his early twenties, 6 feet tall and of medium build and wearing a hooded black North Face jacket and black sunglasses.
According to the PSA, the suspect in the second incident was 6 feet tall and of medium build, wearing a dark hooded jacket, white gloves and a mask covering the face. The PSA does not identify the gender of the suspect in this incident.
Representatives of DPS could not be reached for comment at press time.

Four students were recognized as winners of the Interfaith Dialogue and Service Video and Essay contest Friday afternoon.
The contest, which is a part of the President’s Interfaith and Community Service Challenge, selected students who addressed ways the university’s Jesuit values affect their respective faith backgrounds and community involvement in their submissions.
Grand prize winner Kieran Halloran (SFS ’14) reflected on losing his father, a firefighter, in the September 11, 2011 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and how he was comforted and inspired by those who chose to live as men and women for others.
“While this experience fostered the greatest amount of anger and hatred that I have ever felt in my life, it has also, through a roundabout way, fostered the greatest motivation to love and serve others that I have,” he wrote in his essay.
Stephen Patrick (COL ’13), the second place winner, along with Colleen Tapen (NHS ’13) and Vivian Ojo (SFS ’14), who tied for third place, wrote about how their faiths, community service work, international travel and future goals have influenced their Georgetown experiences.
The essay contest is one of several activities intended to address the university’s chosen theme for the President’ Challenge – combating domestic poverty and improving educational opportunities.
The university will continue to plan interfaith and service-based programming as part of its year-long commitment to the initiative. Programs are being organized by Campus Ministry, the Center for Social Justice and the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs.
The national challenge, which the university accepted in September, is supported by the Department of Education and the Corporation for National and Community Service. The schools deemed the most successful will be recognized by the White House in spring 2012.
Winning essays are available on the Berkley Center’s website.
