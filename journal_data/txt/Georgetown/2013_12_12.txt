An off-campus student residence in the 3300 block of Prospect Street was reportedly burglarized earlier today according to the Department of Public Safety.
A resident reported that a laptop and ipad had both been taken. The student believes that the door to the residence may have been left unlocked at the time of the theft, though there were other residents in the house.
DPS is investigating the incident.
