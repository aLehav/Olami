Although students running for GUSA president and vice president cannot formally declare their candidacy until Thursday, attendance at mandatory information sessions Jan. 31 and Feb. 4 offered an unofficial confirmation of the five tickets entering the 2013 race.
The Georgetown University Student Association election committee required students to attend one of the two sessions in order to appear on the Feb. 21 ballot. There were a total of 10 students in attendance, and multiple sources confirm that the presidential and vice presidential pairings include: Spencer Walsh (MSB ’14) and Robert Silverstein (SFS ’14); Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) and Maggie Cleary (COL ’14); Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson (SFS ’14) and Joe Vandegriff (COL ’14); NateTisa (SFS ’14) and Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14); and Cannon Warren (COL ’14) and Andrew Logerfo(COL ’14).
The group features no underclassmen and no varsity athlete candidate, which ends a two-year trend of members of the men’s basketball team running for executive office. Walsh was a former member of the men’s varsity swimming team.
Tisa and Cleary both ran for the GUSA executive in 2012. Tisa, who ran on an all-sophomore ticket, finished in sixth place out of seven candidates with 322 first-place votes. Cleary, who will again run for vice president, placed fourth with 415 first-place votes.
One ticket features candidates with no experience holding a position in GUSA. Walsh serves as president of Club Cycling, and Silverstein is a member of the Philodemic Society and a former member of the College Democrats executive board.
Appelbaum is a former Student Activities Commission chair and current director of student life report implementation, while his running mate, Cleary, is a former president of the College Republicans and a member of the Philodemic Society.
Corbin-Johnson has been a member of the GUSA senate since her freshman year and is director of the Gospel Choir, a board member of the Latin American Student Association and a member of the Black Student Association. Vandegriff is a former president of the College Democrats and a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon.
Warrenis a two-year GUSA senator, and his running mate, Logerfo, is accounting controller of Students of Georgetown, Inc.
Tisa is speaker of the GUSA senate as well as a former board member of GU Pride. His running mate, Ramadan, is a manager at Hoya Snaxa and a board member of Hoya Blue.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that no potential GUSAcandidates were members of the current executive staff. Appelbaum is a member of the executive staff.

Poor attendance at a Student Activities Commission working group was representative of broader challenges in engagement and communication that the group faces, according to SAC Chair Jennifer Chiang (SFS ’15).
Only SAC commissioners and two student group leaders attended the session, which was intended to be the first in a series of three events.
“The frustrations we see here are the same frustrations student groups feel,” Chiang said of the sparsely attended SAC event.
After an overhaul of its funding process in the past year — switching from funding individual events to allotting lump-sum budgets to student groups each semester — SAC has reduced the red-tape process for budget requests, but many groups remained unsatisfied.
December cuts to SAC budgets now affect student groups by equal percentages across the board, reducing all budget requests by an equal percentage regardless of club size or event scale.
Though SAC allocated a record amount of money for both fall 2012 and spring 2013 semesters, student groups received less than usual due to an increased volume of requests.
“Student leaders have told me that the current system is against larger events because everything gets cut by the same percentage,” commissioner Edouard Mattille (SFS ’14) said. “If that’s a $100 loss, it can be made up easily, but if it’s a $10,000 event, then that’s a lot harder to make up. They would say SAC should do a better job at favoring larger events over smaller things.”
Mattille, however, said that, in an alternative system, SAC would have to exert judgment over which events merit more funding, which extends beyond the body’s purview.
“The big issue is that will you be willing to give SAC the authority to start saying that ‘This is a larger event, so it should be funded at a different level,’” Mattille said. “If we start doing that kind of hair-splitting, it would be giving a lot of power to an organization that probably shouldn’t have that much of a say over what should happen in student life.”
Chiang argued that many groups do not understand the SAC funding system and feel discouraged by the budget cuts — frustration she suggested factored into the limited turnout for Saturday’s event.
“If we could get more people and more ideas, it would be better for the general goal,” she said. “They think we’re just randomly cutting at certain percentages, which is not true. We really want input.”
SAC fulfilled just over 75 percent of groups’ funding requests in spring 2012, about 80 percent in fall 2012 and 69 percent in spring 2013.
“The requests we were getting were bigger than previous semesters,” Mattille said. “Are groups overreaching? Are they overstating the numbers they need? Or are they actually having growth?”
College Democrats Vice President Elyssa Skeirik (SFS ’15) agreed that student groups have an incentive to inflate budgets to obtain more funding.
“There is a big incentive to ask for more money than you need and to put in events you don’t need,”Skeirik said.
Chiang said she has observed a trend of inflating budget requests but said it is difficult tomicromanage club events.
“We can get a sense of groups are asking more money by holding more events and just reallocating money, but we really want to and we do trust our groups,” Chiang said.
Despite increased budget requests and new student groups, SAC’s budget is not likely to expand.
“We only have a finite number of resources,” Chiang said. “We want to hear feedback from student groups to improve our funding system.”
The next working group sessions will be held Feb. 9 and Feb. 23.

Georgetown’s regular decision undergraduate applicant pool for the Class of 2017 was almost identical to that of the previous year, which bucks a trend of application growth in previous years.
A total of 20,025 students applied in the early and regular decision cycles, down just 0.1 percent from last year’s 20,050. Of those, 13,289 were regular decision applications, down slightly from last year’s 13,351. The Class of 2016 continued a trend of year-to-year application increases, with a jump from the previous year’s 19,228 applications.
Although the College received the largest number of applications out of the university’s four schools, with 11,714, this figure marked a 2.5 percent decrease from last year. The School of Foreign Service had the second largest pool, with 3,690 applicants, marking an increase of 1 percent.
A record number of students applied to the McDonough School of Business and the School of Nursing & Health Studies, with the MSB experiencing an 8 percent increase, with 3,370 students applying, and the NHS receiving 1,251 applicants, a 4.2 percent increase.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said these figures, which reflect national trends, have stemmed from ongoing concerns about the economy.
“Students are more concerned with job security,” he said. “They are gravitating to science and pre-med tracks.”
While the total number of applicants remained consistent with last year when a little over 20,100 people applied, this year, the diversity of the student body continues to expand, Deacon said. African Americans made up 7.6 percent of the applicants, Asian Americans 15 percent and Hispanic Americans 11.8 percent.
International students also made up 12.8 percent of this year’s applicant pool. Between 2,200 and 2,400 applicants applied from China and India.
“We are not doing anything new to attract students from those areas,” Deacon said. “There is just a sort of natural momentum.”
As has been the trend in the past few years, the most applicants have come from California, with 2,500 applicants, and New York, which had 1,800 students apply.
Although the early acceptance rate for the Class of 2017 was a record low at 13 percent, Deacon said he expects the overall acceptance rate to remain consistent at about 16 percent.
Citing a report by the Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education, which indicates that the number of high school graduates peaked in 2010 and will decline until 2020, Deacon said he was pleased with Georgetown’s continued success in attracting students to the university.
“Since the total pool of possible applicants is declining, Georgetown has had to, in effect, increase its market share just to stay even,” he said.
Maintaining the same levels of applicants has proved to be a challenge for some schools this year. Boston College’s decision to add a 400-word essay to its Common Application supplement this year caused the number of applications to drop from 35,000 in 2012 to 25,000 this year, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Other peer institutions that use Common App had mixed results. According to a report in The New York Times, Dartmouth College had 23,052 applicants in 2012 but 22,400 in 2013. At Vanderbilt University, 30,870 students applied this year, which marked an 8.9 percent increase over last year when 28,348 submitted applications.
Georgetown is among a small group of universities, along with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that do not use the Common App. That Georgetown maintains such a high number of applicants without using the application system is a point of pride for Deacon.
“If 10,000 students didn’t apply because of one essay, how good can your numbers be?” Deacon said. “Georgetown’s are real.”

Soapy Joe’s, a D.C.-based dry cleaning and laundry service, overcharged 35 Georgetown students throughout the fall 2012 semester.
According to Matt Sternberg, president and co-owner of Soapy Joe’s, a technical error was to blame for the incorrect charges and the company is working to refund customers.
Many students were alerted to potential billing errors through a Facebook post on Jan. 15 by AlexOrndahl (COL ’16).
“I noticed at the end of the semester that they were definitely overcharging,” Orndahl said. “Seventy-five pounds over [the weekly limit] was a little bit impossible.”
After seeing the post, user PJ Barry (MSB ’16) was prompted to look at his bill and saw that he had been charged twice for some weeks. One week, his statement stated that he had 100 pounds of laundry — 80 pounds over his limit.
“I said, ‘this is ridiculous — there is no way,’” Barry recalled.
Students who use Soapy Joe’s register for either a semester or year-long plan of 15, 20 or 25 pounds of laundry per week. Bags are weighed and scanned each time they go into the facility. Students are billed $1.50 for every additional pound over the limit specified in the purchased plan. Thus, Barry was overcharged $120 during the one week he cited.
According to Sternberg, students are notified of overages halfway through and at the end of the semester.
Some students who were overcharged, however, received no such notification.
“They never give you any notification. They just charge you straight to your credit card,” Daniel Sandoval (SFS ’16) said.
When PJ Barry called Soapy Joe’s to inquire about the overage charges, he was told the scanner must have been broken.
Sternberg now acknowledges that the problem was not caused by employee error. “It was 100 percent a programming error on the inside,” he said.
According to Sternberg, many of the overcharges were due to mistakenly designating some students as going over their pound limit. In addition, some students who gave Soapy Joe’s laundry did not appear to be signed up for a plan and were therefore charged $1.35 per pound for all of their laundry in addition to overcharges.
While just over 10 percent of Soapy Joe’s 275 Georgetown clients were affected, students at The George Washington University were also overcharged due to the software malfunction. Sternberg said he was unsure of the exact number of GW students who overpaid.
The three other college campuses where the laundry service is offered — Villanova University, the University of Southern California and the University of Pennsylvania — were not impacted.
“This is the first time we’ve had a serious logistical problem with our service and with Georgetown,” Sternberg said.
He added that although he does not know how much his company overcharged customers, Soapy Joe’s is currently making changes to its computer program to correct the billing mistakes.
“[Soapy Joe’s is] working [quickly] and furiously to try to get people refunds,” he said. “I take full responsibility.”
In addition, Sternberg said the Soapy Joe’s will not charge extra for exceeding the pound limit this semester.
“We want to keep the trust of our Georgetown customers,” Sternberg said.
Orndahl does not plan on using Soapy Joe’s in the future and said that students who do continue with the service should be cautious.
“As long as you are careful and check your overage history, it should be fine,” he said.
Barry said that he is still waiting on a full refund. He and Sandoval, who are both locked into a year-long plan, say they will be doing most of their laundry themselves to avoid overage charges.
“If you have zero clue what you’re doing with laundry, then use [Soapy Joe’s]. But be careful,” Barry said.

Young professionals from Latin America arrived on the Hilltop last week for Georgetown’s Global Competitiveness Leadership Program.
The program, which was launched in 2007 by the university’s Latin American Board, aims to teach students how to tackle the longstanding economic challenges their countries face.
According to Paul Almeida, McDonough School of Business senior associate dean of executive education, the program is unique because of the participants’ passion for social entrepreneurship.
“Most of [the GCL participants] specialize in social entrepreneurship. For me, that’s a huge thing,” Almeidasaid. “They have this common passion for making a difference. It’s incredibly inspiring.”
This year’s 38 participants are between 24 and 34 years old and were chosen in a competitive application process for their demonstrated leadership abilities. The program, which lasts 12 weeks, covers the students’ tuition, room, board and travel while in Washington, D.C.
While at Georgetown, the students will take a variety of courses offered by faculty in the MSB, the School of Foreign Service and the College.
The classes aim to give participants a deeper understanding of Latin America and arm them with practical skills in business and management so they can make an impact when they return to their home countries.
Upon their return, the students will launch their own action-learning projects — social initiatives that they will plan while at Georgetown.
“Most of them may not have had the business training to make these very worthy projects a reality, and that’s what coming here gives them,” Almeida said. “It gives them exposure; it gives them insight. It’s how to make a real difference on the ground.”
In one week-long course, students will represent different Latin American companies and participate in activities that will give them experience in working environments that place a premium on competitiveness and alliances.
“It’s very live learning; it’s not just sitting in class,” Almeida said.
One week into the program, Marco Pires, a journalist from Brazil, has already found the program engaging.
“The program has been great so far,” Pires said. “The staff is really helpful and the classes are top-notch. We always have high-level discussions during sessions.”
In particular, Pires appreciates how the program fosters a sense of community among the diverse student body, which includes people of different backgrounds from across Latin America.
“When you put in the same space a bunch of self-motivated people with a lot of ideas, you realize we all face the same problems,” Pires said. “That means we have a very powerful opportunity to help each other with our skills and networking to solve real world problems that we all share. … To me, this is very special.”

The Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union launched an application for iPhone and Android devices as part of an effort to provide customers with easier access to banking services Monday.
Customers can now check balances, make transfers and look up ATM locations, GUASFCU hours and contact information from their phone. GUASFCU is working to add a feature allowing users to deposit checks from the app, according to CEO Nikhil Lakhanpal (MSB ’13).
“It’s basically a one-stop center for all your GUASFCU banking needs,” Lakhanpal said. “Because we only have one branch, we have to adopt a branchless model of banking, so what that means is making it really convenient for our members without the luxury of having a number of branches across the country,” Lakhanpal added. “This is the perfect way to do that.”
GUASFCU’s technology department began building the application in collaboration with multiple vendors at the beginning of the fall semester. Lakhanpal said that he is satisfied with the application so far.
“I’ve gotten emails, I’ve gotten texts saying it’s a very good application and people are impressed, so that makes me very happy,” he said.
The application is part of a series of improvements made by GUASFCU to increase banking access for its members. The credit union’s other main efforts include the addition of an ATM to the Walsh Building in January and an ATM planned to be added to Hoya Snaxa in March.
Students are generally satisfied with the mobile app.
“I do a lot of my banking online, so having it on my phone is much easier,” Kerry Ryan (COL ’13) said. “So I think [the mobile app] is definitely beneficial and will help GUASFCU.”

When Neesha Tambe (COL ’13) and Jocelyn Fong (SFS ’14) began discussing social-justice issues on and off campus, they saw something lacking in Georgetown’s social-justice resources.
Tambe thought Georgetown’s social-justice opportunities and groups were too disparate and needed a source of unity, while Fong wanted to create a forum for individuals to discuss matters of social justice.
As a solution to both problems, Tambe and Fong launched JUST, the university’s first social-justice publication, in December.
“Though motivated for different reasons, we both came to the conclusion that a social-justice publication on campus could be a space to thoughtfully discuss social justice, one of the cornerstone values of Jesuit ideals,” Fong said.
Tambe, who is the Georgetown University Student Association secretary of social justice, and Fong, who is executive editor of the new publication, received $250 from GUSA to make these two visions a reality.
The creation of JUST marks the culmination of a long series of efforts by students involved in the Center for Social Justice and other related campus groups to spark a university-wide discussion about social-justice issues.
“We challenge our readers and writers to think critically and constructively about social inequality in our communities,” Fong said.
The publication aims to build bridges between student groups and academic departments, as well as between students and faculty. JUST seeks input from all individuals and groups.
Contributions thus far have focused on education, highlighting students’ experiences with D.C. Reads and the D.C. Schools Project, social-justice work in schools around the world, Georgetown’s approach to teaching social justice in the classroom and the use of art in education. A wide variety of campus groups, including the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, the CSJ and GUSA, have contributed to the magazine.
“It’s the connection of articles altogether that represents JUST’s goal: to connect social justice on campus and spark discussion in our community,” Fong said.
JUST staffer Sarah Mock (SFS ’15) said that the publication is important because it highlights social-justice efforts that may otherwise go unnoticed. She argued that the publication has the potential to shape people’s understanding of such issues.
“[It is] a way to show the larger Georgetown community that the idea of social justice is a fluid complex that is molded to our interests … and to reach out to students that are intimidated or feel like they don’t fit quite right into more traditional service options,” Mock said.
With this initial success, the JUST staff recognizes the publication can and should grow moving forward.
“We feel as though we’ve only scratched the surface of the many pockets of social justice on campus, so we’re really excited to tap into more of them,” Fong said.

Georgetown Cupcake, an area bakery and subject of the TLC reality show “DC Cupcake,” came under a tax lien filed by Washington D.C.’s Office of Tax and Revenue on Jan. 31. after the business failed to own up to more than $200,000 in sales taxes over a three month period.
According to the lien, the store neglected to pay $69,571.78 in August, $66,363.74 in September and $53,357.19 in October.
The Washington Business Daily reported that the lien had been filed after more than two weeks of discussion between Georgetown Cupcake and the Office of Tax and Revenue.
By Friday morning, however, the bakery had complied with the lien: documents filed with the tax office declared the Certificate of Delinquent Sales and Use “paid and satisfied.”
But representatives of the company have not provided a full account of how or why the error occurred or why the Office of Tax and Revenue was not reimbursed until now.
A prepared statement from BWR Public Relations, which represents Georgetown Cupcake, offered little explanation.
“Georgetown Cupcake has paid its taxes to the DC Office of Tax and Revenue in full, and any misunderstanding has been resolved. The lien was released less than 24 hours after it was issued,” the statement read.
Store employees were not authorized to speak due to provisions in their contracts.

According to Provost Robert Groves, the forthcoming shift in his office’s organization, which will create four new administrative positions, represents an alignment with the policies of several other universities across the country.
The reorganization, which was announced in an email to Georgetown students Wednesday afternoon, will create four new positions: vice provost for faculty, vice provost for education, vice provost for research and vice president for finance and program analytics. In tandem with these changes to his own office, Groves has also chosen current Vice President and Chief Finance Officer Darryl Christmon as chief operating officer for the main campus, a newly created role Christmon will begin this July, joining university-wide COO Chris Augostini.
“This is our way of becoming a better university through more vibrant research, more relevant educational programs and the best faculty we can recruit,” Groves said. “I believed that if we had provost-level attention to these things, we could make [them] better.”
According to Groves, vice provost positions are common among universities and Georgetown is relatively unusual in its lack of such a structure. Vice provosts will be current faculty members who will devote 75 percent of their time to their new positions while continuing to research and teach.
“I want to make sure the provost’s office makes decisions that are integrated with the perspective of faculty and that, over time, we have more faculty who understand administrative issues at the university,” Groves said.
Grovessaid that the vice provost positions’ three-year term limit was motivated by his desire to maintain communication with both students and faculty.
“I want a variety of faculty members in the positions over time and I want to maintain our devotion to teaching,” Groves said.
The vice provost for research position will focus on enhancing research opportunities and resources for all members of the university community.
“We want to increase the volume of research for graduates, undergraduates and faculty,” Groves said. “That, in my opinion, requires more of an emphasis on constructing an environment where that can happen.”
The vice provost for education, meanwhile, will improve communication between departments, schools and campuses, emphasizing integration of undergraduate and graduate programs and expanded interdisciplinary programs.
This same cooperative attitude will be applied to the vice provost for faculty position, which is intended to create an environment and hiring system in which faculty can easily work across schools to stimulate interdisciplinary research.
“We want to continue to have a world-class faculty; we believe that one way to do that is to create an environment where joint appointments of faculty across different units are supported,” Groves said.
An advisory committee including students and faculty members will develop a list of candidates for these three vice provost positions and suggest professors for the positions as soon as they identify qualified candidates. Groves said he expects the three positions to be filled by summer or early fall.
The vice president for finance and program analytics will be responsible for database management and improving efficiency. Potential projects include collecting data about students, departments and programs to analyze efficiency based on revenue and the costs of specific programs.
Grovessaid that he would consider hiring the financial and analytical expert from outside the university, employing an outside firm to identify suitable candidates. Georgetown has used executive search firm Witt/Kieffer in past searches, but Groves did not specify which firm would be employed for this search.
Grovesemphasized the long-term effects of these institutional changes.
“Many of the changes that we want to make will take years before their value will be known. These are big things we are doing, but I wouldn’t have done it if I didn’t believe that this was the direction we should move.”

Georgetown has inched further up in the Peace Corps’ annual rankings of colleges and universi-ties that send the most volunteers to the program, according to data released today by the Peace Corps.
The 31 undergraduate alumni that currently serve in the Peace Corp are enough to bump George-town to number eight in the rankings for medium-sized schools, up from the tenth-place spot it held last year.
According to a Georgetown University press release, nearly 900 alumni have served in the Peace Corps since 1961, when the program was started by the Kennedy administration.
“These volunteers are applying the skills and knowledge they acquired during their time at Georgetown University to help improve the lives of people across the globe,” said Carrie Hessler-Radelet, acting director of the Peace Corps, in the university press release. “They are achieving tangible results in development projects in agriculture, community economic development, education, the environment, health and youth development.”
Georgetown University, however, remains behind two other D.C. universities in the rankings. American University and the George Washington University rank second and third respectively on the medium-sized school list.

French Ambassador Francois Delattre joined officials from the French and German embassies Friday in a roundtable discussion commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Elysee Treaty, or Treaty of Friendship, between Germany and France.
“The Treaty of Friendship is still very alive and productive on all meaningful levels,” BMW Center for German and European Studies Director Jeffrey Anderson said.
Delattre focused his keynote address on the nature of French-U.S. relations, the continued importance of collaboration between France and Germany and the Arab Spring.
“The Franco-German relationship is the main engine of European construction and therefore is one of the main features of the transatlantic relationship [between the United States and France],”Delattre said. “I would like to tell you how profoundly France and Germany share a common and continuing relationship.”
French President and member of the Socialist Party François Hollande’s win over former President Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2012 election provoked some tension between France and Germany, especially as they struggled to deal with fiscal problems within the European Union. Nonetheless,Delattre pointed to these tensions as a foundation for European advancement.
“The fact that we come from different backgrounds is the best leverage we have to be a leader in the European integration process,” Delattre said. “Chancellor [Angela] Merkel and PresidentHollande have a wonderful personal relationship.”
Neil Walther (GRD ’14) agreed with Delattre’s assessment of current Franco-German relations.
“Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, openly supported the president who lost, Sarkozy, and so that may have slighted the current president of France a little,” Walther said. “But at the same time, [Hollande] flew to Berlin on his inauguration day, so that’s always a good sign. I think there might have been a little turbulence before the election, but afterwards I think everything is normal.”
Furthermore, Walther thought the event was a timely commemoration of a historic treaty.
“The panels looked at varying aspects of the relationships,” Walther said. “[They] looked at the economic factors, the security issues, social issues, it covered a wide breadth. I thought it was well representative of the state of relations.”
Marcus Dominick (COL ’14), an intern at the French embassy, thought the event clearly explained the state of French international relations.
“I thought [Delattre] was a very down-to-earth and engaging speaker, charming in a way,” Dominick said. “I thought it was a pretty convincing account of the French-American relationship.”
The BMW Center of German and European Studies sponsored the event.

With their first year behind them, the Student Group Union is looking ahead to new forms of collaboration between student groups after electing 11 new representatives last Sunday.
While much of the group’s work last year focused on increasing campus presence, this semesterSGU plans to adopt a more action-oriented agenda.
“We’re obviously going to be still looking to student groups to get that feedback [from groups], but a lot more of our energy is going to be focused on actually making things happen and crafting solutions this semester,” Performing Arts Representative and Chair Aman Shahi (COL ’13) said.
At the SGU Summit in December, the group discussed and developed a plan to improve the availability and ease of access to student space on campus. SGU representatives plan to bring this issue and their plan to create a programming incident report form before the administration in March or April.
SGU elected representatives for advocacy, club sports, common interests, cultural groups, non-advisory board groups, religious groups, performing arts, political groups, student government and volunteer groups this week. The media representative position remains vacant after a candidate who was running unopposed dropped out of the race at the last minute.
Approximately half of the elected representatives are returning committee members from last year, lending continuity to the group’s efforts.
SGU has supported collaboration between its 80 members, who all represent various campus organizations. This semester, projects include moving organization finances online, improving the Mission and Ministry Report and consolidating forms in the Center for Student Programs.
Representative for religious groups Chris Cannataro (MSB ’15), who also serves as deputy grand knight of the Georgetown University Knights of Columbus, said the discussion was relevant to religious organizations despite their differences from other campus bodies.
“Religious groups —although they have different structures —all have similar stories, in a way, to other student groups,” Cannataro said. “Our summit last semester allowed student leaders the opportunity to discuss issues involving reserving space on campus, and this opportunity for discourse is good and benefits all groups.”
With these benefits in mind, Cannataro said that he will seek to continue discussion about religious organization projects, and he will highlight funding issues going forward.
“My primary goal is give religious groups a voice … and then what stems from that is looking at the [Mission and Ministry] Report and then looking at the whole organization funding issue,” Cannatarosaid.
Representative for non-advisory board groups Charlotte Cherry (SFS ’16) said that SGU has helped Georgetown Energy complete projects like the addition of solar panels to university townhouses.
“To be successful, Georgetown Energy work relies heavily on integration and coordination between many groups, especially between the students and university leadership,” Cherry wrote in an email.
Additionally, Cherry expressed excitement about speaking on behalf of student leaders and organizations.
“My real motivation is to be an approachable member of SGU and be open to new opinions,” Cherry said. “I want to listen to the perspectives of my fellow students and make sure that those voices are heard between student groups and with administration.”

A five-year, $100 million expansion plan for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was announced Jan. 29 to remedy space constraints as the cultural center expands its art education and management programs.
The current plan includes three connected pavilions to accommodate classrooms, rehearsal space, lecture rooms, multipurpose rooms and office space. One of the pavilions will float on the Potomac River and have an outdoor stage. The expansion will also include public gardens, restaurants and a video wall to project indoor Kennedy Center performances and other events.
“The Kennedy Center has the largest arts education program in the country without having any dedicated facilities to serve these growing programs,” Kennedy Center President Michael Kaiser said in a press release. “I’m so pleased the Kennedy Center will have spaces specifically designed for these functions to help fulfill our mission of bringing arts education to students across Washington and to millions of people across the country.”
The project will be financed entirely by private funds, including a $50 million donation by David M.Rubenstein.
“I am pleased to pledge these funds as the lead gift to the Kennedy Center expansion project and encourage others to donate to this project,” Rubenstein said in a press release.
The center has launched a fundraising campaign to raise an additional $75 million, according to Kennedy Center press director John Dow. Of these $75 million, one-third will go toward future programming activities and are not needed for the expansion project.
“To put things in perspective, the Kennedy Center raises about $80 million a year in fundraising,” Dow said. “We are very confident that we will be able to raise the $50 million for this project over the next five years.”
Congress — which regulates federal funds used for the center’s maintenance and operation — unanimously approved a bill to approve the expansion project in June. The renovation will only expand onto land already owned by the center. It will take three years for Steven Holl Architects to finalize the design and for zoning and planning boards approve it and an additional two years for construction.
One main goal of the expansion, which will be designed by architects Steven Holl and Chris McVoy, is to add much-needed space for Kennedy Center programs.
“The vision for the project is to expand the Kennedy Center … in a way that embodies and extends the Kennedy Center as a living memorial … to JFK and as a national cultural center,” McVoy said.
The other purpose of the expansion is to create an aesthetically pleasing outdoor destination, which Dow hopes will make the Kennedy Center a daytime and nighttime attraction.
“The performances that up to this point have been contained within the existing building will now extend outside through the screening terrace, through the active, dynamic presence of the pavilions, and through the gardens,” McVoy said. “We’re taking that creative energy that’s been in the existing monumental building and … projecting it into the city.”
