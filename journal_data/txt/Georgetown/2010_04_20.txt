For members of Diversability, discussion of disability issues on campus has gained momentum.
Participants in “The Ability to Express,” which will be held from 8 to 10 p.m. in ICC 102 on Wednesday, will be asked to finger-paint as a way of visualizing conceptions of disability, “to counter the negative stereotypes and stigmas that are often associated,” Diversability board member Elisa Dun (SFS ’10) said in an e-mail.
“Disability means something different to every person affected by it,” Dun said.
According to Tiffany Yu (MSB ’10), founder of the Diversability initiative, this event will demonstrate diverse perspectives on the topic that she said “transcends demographics.”
Since receiving a $500 Reimagine Georgetown grant this fall, Yu put her proposal into action with Diversability, a group with a dual purpose: to raise awareness about disability and to reshape people’s ideas about disability. Yu called the grant invaluable in the aid it has provided and credits it with making the group known on campus.
Since its formation as a working group last October, Diversability has become a full-fledged student organization. It hosted its first event in February, called “The Ability to Laugh.” The event involved discussion centering on the documentary film “Look Who’s Laughing,” which chronicles the stories of comics with disabilities, according to Yu.
Taylor Price (MSB ’10), who has been an active opponent of discrimination against people with physical disabilities, said that he feels Diversability a needed presence to campus.
“Diversability is just a great initiative,” Price said. “It brings people together and raises awareness.”
Dun said that she became involved with Diversability after finding the rest of the community lacking in drive to address “able-ism,” which she defines as “discrimination against persons with disabilities.”
Price agreed with Dun about the need for discussions addressing disability issues. “So far this group is still really breaking ground,” he said. “There’s never been a group like this on campus.” Dun and Yu both cited a lack of knowledge of disability issues as the primary cause of this apathy.
“One question I’ve often been asked is, `Why should people care about this?'” Yu said in an e-mail. “And that’s exactly why we’ve created this group. . Disability affects all of us, and we want to think of creative ways that students can start or continue the conversation.”
Yu also attributes Diversability’s success in part to the support from various on-campus organizations, including chaplains-in-residence, hall directors and area coordinators, members of the Academic Resource Center, InterHall, the department of English, the LGBTQ Resource Center and Health Education Services. She said she hopes that the widespread enthusiasm will help propel Diversability to success even beyond her graduation from Georgetown.

Faculty pay and compensation at Georgetown were relatively stagnant last year, as professors’ salaries around the country increased at a historically low rate.
Full professors at the Georgetown University’s main campus and Law Center made an average of $155,500 last year, a decrease of $400 from the year before, according to a report published in 2010 by the American Association of University Professors. The average salary of an associate professor fell by $300 and the average salary of an assistant professor increased by $3,100. The average salary for all professors increased by $100, and the average compensation, which rose in all categories, grew overall by $1,500.
The average salary of a full-time faculty member increased by 1.2 percent nationwide last year, the smallest increase in the 50 years since the AAUP began surveying faculty pay.
Inflation rose by 2.7 percent last year.
“It’s obviously not a good thing, but compared to the rest of the world losing their jobs, it’s not too bad,” Faculty Senate President Wayne Davis said. “Nobody’s happy about it, but we’re still functioning.”
Davis said that slimmer average salaries did not necessarily mean that anyone received a pay cut.
“The salaries of the full professors who depart are normally a lot higher than those of the typically younger faculty who replace them,” he said. “So continuing professors might get a sizeable increase without the average full professor salary increasing.”
Davis said that the average base salary for main campus professors rose by 1.25 percent this academic year and is scheduled to rise by 2.5 percent annually starting next year.
“I think we caught up to our peer institutions,” Davis said of the main campus increases.
Men earned more than women in every category, according to the AAUP. The largest difference was for assistant professors, where men made 14.9 percent more than women on average.

The U.S.-Afghan Women’s Council hosted a reception Monday night to facilitate the ongoing discussion and creation of student initiatives focusing on the women of Afghanistan. Over 50 students, faculty, graduate students and community members attended the event in the Philodemic Room aimed to expose the greater community to networking opportunities related to their interests in Afghanistan.
The U.S.-Afghan Women’s Council is a public-private partnership established to utilize public and private sector resources to empower Afghan women. University President John J. DeGioia was appointed co-chair in 2009 when the council moved to Georgetown University.
Organized by Phyllis Magrab, the director of the Center for Child and Human Development and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization chair, who leads the consortium of Georgetown’s program of U.S.-Afghan Women’s Council, Kelly Krohn (SFS ’13) and the Lecture Fund, the event focused on networking and pursuing initiatives with the members of the Georgetown community invested in the future of Afghanistan.
Krohn said, “Our goal is to get all components of Georgetown interested in [Afghanistan] . we hope to start a formalized student group here at Georgetown.”
Afghan student Rafi Khetab (SFS ’12) is working with Krohn to bring their vision of a student organization devoted to Afghanistan to life. After detailing the dangerous interaction with the Taliban that he endured on his trip to obtain a student visa to study here, Khetab stressed to the audience the significance of education to the Afghan people.
“Afghanistan unfortunately is suffering greatly from a lack of educational opportunities . Anything we can do to help them improve their education will make a great difference in their lives, and the future of the country depends on it,” he said.
Magrab said her goal for the evening was to form a network of students motivated to innovate change in Afghanistan, as part of a push for increased enthusiasm among students in addressing the many issues facing the Afghan people today.
Ambassador Steve Steiner, senior adviser in the Department of State’s Office of Global Women’s Issues, said of the United States’ view, “We are looking to empower women all over the world, and Afghanistan is a huge priority. We want to get it right there, and to get it right we want to help women help themselves.”
The council’s executive director, Eva Weigold Schultz, said that the council would love to bring the community into the council as new members, as “there is such a universe of opportunities to engage in – from mentoring to research to anything you would like to offer.”
Several faculty members attended the event, including Associate Professor of Communication, Culture and Technology Master’s Program J. P. Singh and Carol Lancaster, interim dean and professor of politics for the School of Foreign Service.
Some of the students and graduate students in attendance were already nonprofit start-ups. David Lee (NHS ’11) launched the initiative Stinky Peace through his nonprofit Sanitation NOW, New Opportunities for Women, which creates jobs and development opportunities for women and children with operations in Afghanistan, India, Bangladesh and Kenya. He said, “I think this was great how we brought in so many faculty and students today . This was a very successful event.”
Heidi Schaler, the executive director of Friends of the American University of Afghanistan, spoke of the 4-year-old American University of Afghanistan’s dire need of basic supplies, such as pens and uniforms for its sports teams. Reiterating the importance of such a high percentage of women attending their school, a number over 20 percent, Schaler said she would love to work with anyone at Georgetown and suggested several fundraising events, such as a book drive and cover charges at networking events like Thursday’s event.
Concerned community member Mati Arsala said he was very impressed by the amount of interest in the problems of Afghanistan here at Georgetown. Speaking as an Afghan-American and a Maryland resident, he said, “I have seen a lot – women are treated over there as second and even third class citizens. We can do better than that.”
Beth Goldberg (SFS ’12), a student intrigued by the precarious situations in countries like Somalia and Afghanistan, said, “I thought it was a good culmination of minds and good networking opportunities.”
Students who are interested in getting involved were welcomed to contact Magrab, Krohn or Khetab.

The Hoya held elections on Saturday to fill various editorial and organizational posts for this fall. The process lasted close to 11 hours as the current staff of The Hoya interviewed and then voted on candidates for each position.
There was no turnover among the paper’s top three editors. Eamon O’Connor (COL ’12) and Kathryn DeVincenzo (COL ’12) were re-elected as executive editor and managing editor, respectively.
Editor-in-Chief Marissa Amendolia (COL ’11) was not up for re-election, as she was elected in November to a year-long term, a newly mandated term length for the editor-in-chief following a change to policy guidelines in 2009.
“I’m very pleased with the results of elections this semester,” Amendolia said. “We have a promising mix of new faces in addition to a number of staff members who have stayed on board. The general atmosphere of elections was optimistic, with a commitment to improvement as the underlying theme.”
Kevin Barber (COL ’11), a former editor-in-chief and current contributing editor, was selected as chair of the board of directors.
“This semester’s elections were, as always, a time for The Hoya to reflect on the past and set priorities for the future,” Barber said. “I’m excited to work with the board of directors in the coming year to realize this organization’s ambitions.”

An armed robbery occurred Monday at 11:41 p.m. at Café Bonaparte on the 1500 block of Wisconsin Avenue NW, according to Alfred Corbin, the street operations manager of the Georgetown Business Improvement District.
Two suspects entered Café Bonaparte with guns and pushed an employee down the stairs, who is now in The George Washington University Hospital without serious injury, according to James Duggan, a friend of the victim. No shots were fired.
At press time, MPD was investigating the scene inside Café Bonaparte.
There were at least five emergency vehicles surrounding the 3300 block of P Street just before 1 a.m. Tuesday morning. At least seven officers from the Metropolitan Police Department were searching multiple houses, accompanied by several police dogs. MPD was unable to confirm if this police activity was related to the armed robbery.

Members of the Georgetown, Divest! coalition brought their case to the Georgetown University Student Association Senate meeting Sunday night, spurring discussion about potential changes to the university’s investment process.
Five members of Georgetown, Divest! met with Georgetown administrators on April 9, but were unable to make headway with the university.
The coalition lectured on what it called a dearth of transparency in current university investment protocol that inhibits student access to information in the Investment Office.
Jackson Perry (COL ’12), vice president of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), told the senate that Georgetown did not engage in “socially responsible investing.” This was due, he said, to the Georgetown University Investment Office’s policy to not make public the details of its investment decisions.
Perry showed the council a screen photo of the Investment Office Web site from April 9, 2010, which displayed a paragraph stating that a Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility would “[review] all shareholder proposals on social responsibility” with the shareholders including the students at Georgetown University, according to Perry.
Perry claimed that when meeting with university administrators, “They claimed that the information on the Web site was out of date, even though it was only put up a year ago.”
He then showed another screen photo, from April 12, which showed the same passage mentioned had been deleted.
Citing a speech delivered by University President John J. DeGioia on Feb. 4, 2007, Perry said the perceived shortfalls in communication violated Georgetown policy.
Three years ago, DeGioia said, “Our heritage requires that social justice issues are never consigned to the shadows of our consciousness.”
GUSA President Calen Angert (MSB ’11) asked how many companies the coalition was examining.
Angert also asked about the feasibility of the project, saying, “These are huge funds that we’re invested in, and I doubt that all of our endowment [$1 billion] is invested in just one of them.”
SJP President Elise Garofalo (COL ’12) added that even without the approval of the Investment Office, students could write letters to the managers of the funds voicing their concern.
Senator Nick Troiano (COL ’11) was more defensive of the Investment Office.
“There are trade secrets and other rules and regulations that prevent information from being divulged,” Troiano said.
Troiano also questioned the ability of the university to reform the system, saying, “At the end of the day, you want the university to be able to say to the [investment] companies that they don’t want to invest in those companies. How do you get to that point?”
Perry responded, “Student involvement should be encouraged. As long as there is sufficient evidence, there should be a process to protest. There needs to be a way to make sure [the investment companies and the Investment Office] are telling the truth.”
Ultimately, Perry said, “We’re envisioning a resolution calling on the university to establish a process on how it does socially responsible justice. The mechanism by which students can voice concerns about the investments would be very important.”
Senator Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) expressed her view that GUSA should become the overseer of complaints about socially responsible investments, saying, “Any student concerns [about investments] should be brought to GUSA, a resolution drafted and then a vote held.”
Troiano discussed the possibility of a resolution at the meeting the following week.
“We should support effort[s] for the mechanism to protest, but I am not so enthused that we try to force the university to say yes or no on specific companies or countries as investment choices,” Troiano said.
In other matters, Senator Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) reported that the Performing Arts Advisory Council signed an agreement with GUSA, vowing to open the election of PAAC leaders to member organizations. Now, the groups comprising PAAC will be able to veto applicants, as long as a simple majority votes against them.
**Correction:** This article originally stated that Georgetown, Divest! coalition members met with university administrators on April 13. The meeting took place on April 9.

Examining communism’s grasp on post-war Poland, last night former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) screened his new film that recounts Pope John Paul II’s pilgrimage to the country and the visit’s role in restoring Polish national identity.
Addressing a packed auditorium in the Intercultural Center, Gingrich said the film, “Nine Days That Changed the World,” offered a powerful demonstration of religious faith’s power over tyranny. The Catholic Students Association sponsored the event along with the College Republicans.
“I think the concept of freedom through faith is central to the original reason that Georgetown was founded. It’s essential to the establishment of the United States. I think it is central to the struggle going on today in Cuba and China and Iran and Russia, and so many places around the world,” Gingrich said.
The documentary interviews Polish academic, political and religious leaders who discuss their memories of the visit. The sources’ emotions often bleed into the interviews, offering additional evidence of the visit’s mark on Polish hearts and minds,
While the event was co-hosted by College Republicans and featured a former Republican congressman, Melinda Reyes (SFS ’12), co-president of the Catholic Students Association, stressed that the event was nonpartisan.
“Anyone at the event would note that there was no mention of anything related to [Gingrich’s] career as speaker or his political affiliations. It was focused entirely on the role of John Paul II,” Reyes said.
Reyes added that the College Democrats were initially sponsors of the event, but they removed their sponsorship before the screening.
History professor Andrzej Kaminski said that John Paul II mixed intelligence and stubbornness with an ability to listen to his adversaries. This ability made the pope a particularly powerful force against the communist rule, he said.
“It really said a lot about the faith of the Polish people and how it united them,” Stephen McDonald (SFS ’13) said. “It showed the events from people who were actually there. [The emotion] added to it, because it’s difficult to look at those sorts of things without the emotional aspect to it.”
Reyes said at the screening that the film’s message tied closely to Georgetown’s Catholic identity.
“It is a good reminder of what role our faith as a Catholic university, and on an individual level, can have in international affairs,” she said. “There’s something inherent in faith that leads you to yearn for freedom and vice versa, and I think John Paul II really embodied that.”

A student was sexually assaulted at gunpoint on Friday morning in West Georgetown, according to the Metropolitan Police Department.
The student was walking on the south side of the 3300 block of Prospect Street around 2 a.m. when an unknown male approached the student from behind and pushed her up against a wall, according to the Metropolitan Police Department’s incident report. The suspect said, “Be quiet, [and] give me everything you got.”
The suspect put the gun he had been holding in his pocket and stole the victim’s cell phone. The suspect then put his hand up the victim’s dress and removed her underwear. The victim was able to escape and reported no physical injuries.
The victim described the suspect as a black male about 6-foot-3 inches tall and of medium build. The suspect was wearing a black T-shirt and dark jeans, and he was last seen running toward M Street, according to the MPD report.
The Department of Public Safety responded to the student’s campus residence at 3:16 a.m., and MPD is conducting an ongoing investigation.
This incident closely follows a sexual assault in Copley Hall that occurred on April 9, in addition to a series of other recent burglaries that have happened within a block of campus.
“We are very concerned about these recent incidents,” Director of Media Relations Andy Pino said.
“MPD has increased their patrols in the neighborhood and have also provided some dedicated resources to combat these crimes. In addition to the MPD response, we are continuing to share the cost of extra police security on key evenings with a neighborhood association,” Pino said.
DPS has also increased patrols in certain off-campus areas and DPS is continuing to work with MPD to coordinate crime prevention and response, according to Pino.

*Whether grabbing a UG Love from Uncommon Grounds or stocking up on essentials from Vital Vittles, most of the Georgetown community interacts with one of The Corp’s seven services every day. However, few people know how The Corp operates on a daily basis. Josh Feller (COL ’11) was appointed the chief operating officer of The Corp in January of this year. A mathematics major from northwest D.C., Josh met with THE HOYA to explain the inner workings of The Corp.*
**How did you get involved in The Corp?**
I got involved with The Corp the summer after my freshman year. My freshman year, I didn’t really know much about The Corp at all. I applied because I was somewhat burnt out from the year, and I didn’t want to do an internship. I wanted to have – I don’t know, I wanted to have sort of a different job. I wasn’t really happy with my college experience, so I thought working at a coffee shop would be an interesting thing to do, so I applied to Uncommon Grounds. I got hired there, and I absolutely loved it.
**So you are the COO of The Corp. Describe that job and what the day-to-day responsibilities of being the COO are.**
Every year the COO coordinates the transition process for the entire Corp, so I’ll set up interviews, application timelines, making sure that everyone knows what’s going on for director-level, service, [upper management] and middle management. I’m also in charge of day-to-day operations of each service, so what that’ll entail is if something breaks and the [operations] person at that store can’t fix it or they’re not sure what’s going on, then often them or me will talk to our service provider [or] our tech [support], and we’ll get them to come in and look at it.
I talk a lot with service directors, [so] if there’s any problems that come up with their store or with personnel, then I’m the person to get in touch [with] because I know what’s going on [in] other services, that way if we have resources we need, [we can reallocate them]. So, like, at [Hoya] Snaxa, we ran out of receipt paper, so we borrowed some from Vittles. That might not sound exciting but just helping coordinate that effort [is part of my job], I also handle all of our legal stuff, so health inspections, business licenses [and] all that fun stuff.
**It sounds like you have to have a pretty good working knowledge of each branch of The Corp. How do you keep track of all that?**
I wouldn’t say I’m an expert on everything, because I don’t have to be. I know how Uncommon Grounds works very well because I was hired there, and in general, [the other] coffee services [as well]. The grocery [stores], like Snaxa and Vittles, have two directors [each] who know their store inside and out, so if I ever have questions, they’re my people. I don’t think anyone coming into this job would be able to know The Corp inside and out as well as we would [like] but, you know, it’s part of the learning curve. You pick it up and you learn from other people. And I get trained for my specific tasks, so I can focus on that.
**Why do you enjoy working for The Corp?**
I think the reason why I enjoy working for The Corp the most and why I still love it is I feel comfortable. I think [The Corp] does a great job of letting their employees be exactly who they are. You don’t ever have to feel like you’re putting on a show for someone, and you can be exactly who you are, and people will appreciate you as an individual, and I really like that. And just working with the other people I’ve gotten to know, they’re fantastic.
**What do you think it is about the way The Corp is run that makes it so welcoming, as you’ve said?**
I think it’s part of the culture. I think it’s that people are excited when they work for The Corp and they feel like they are invested in it, [so] they’re very quick to open themselves up and open the store up to the new hires because they want them to see how great of an experience it can be.
**What, so far, is your proudest personal accomplishment working for The Corp?**
I’d say one of my biggest goals coming into this position was to make sure people have the right tools to do their job. If machines are breaking while they’re working, it’s not their fault and they can’t really do anything about it, so I really wanted to focus on that. Since I’ve come into the position, we’ve helped to replace the espresso machine at [The] Midnight Mug, so they just got a brand new espresso machine a couple weeks ago, and we’ve also replaced a couple older pieces of equipment at different services as well, so I’m happy we’ve been able to get that done.
**So what are some of your projects going into the summer and the start of the new school year?**
We need to make sure we’re doing [everything] we can be doing, so making sure we have equipment that works, and that’s still a struggle. Like I said earlier, things still break. Our tech man John is actually coming this afternoon or tomorrow to take a look at a piece of equipment at Midnight and a piece of equipment at [More Uncommon Grounds].
So that’s just correcting and making sure stuff works, but I also want to work with the directors of the different services with training at different services to make sure we’re putting people in the best position to make sure they know exactly what they should be doing and that they don’t necessarily need to be calling their director of [operations] or their [storewide] director if something goes wrong, and [that] they know how to fix problems on their own and just increase self-sufficiency. That’s my biggest goal. Also, within The Corp, I’d like to see better communication because there’s a lot going on [and] a lot of people working with us so it’s easy for things to be happening and not [have] everyone realize [it] or things just kind of get thrown on you, so we just want to make sure that everyone’s in the loop.
**What skills have you developed while working at The Corp?**
I think my skills working with other people have definitely improved a lot. A lot of my job is interacting with different people, working with them to help fix issues at their store, dealing with difficult situations. I mean, being in my position, I do have to have uncomfortable conversations from time to time, and it’s not something that I enjoy doing or not something that [anyone] enjoys doing, but it’s something that you learn how to do. You interact with a wide range of people, and it’s helped me become comfortable and just [be] able to do that better.
Working for The Corp has also helped me to be more independent. I mean, it’s all student-run, so we’re essentially making all the decisions ourselves, so just to be able to think something out, to commit to it and to put in all the research and effort to make sure something works because there’s no one above me saying, `do this and do that,’ like I’m supposed to be on [top of things].
**Where do you see yourself 10 years from now and how do you think your future will be affected by the skills you’ve acquired at The Corp?**
To be honest, I’m not really sure where I see myself in 10 years, and I don’t even know where I see myself at the end of next year after I graduate. And it’s something I think about a fair amount, but I still don’t have a good answer. I’m debating whether I want to go to medical school or not or if I want to go to a different grad program or maybe doing some sort of service work after college. I hope wherever I am 10 years from now, I’ll [be] happy and my experience as COO of The Corp will definitely impact me just because of how much I’m learning about myself and how to interact with other [people] and how to try to be a good person.
It’s never easy. I just feel like I’m learning a lot about myself, how to handle stress, how to juggle a lot of things, how to deal with hard situations, how to work on my own [and] how to watch out for other people. It’s been a great experience, it’s tough and it’s a whirlwind, it’s incredibly worth it and I know I’m going to be infinitely better off coming out of this position. I’ll be a better person coming out of it than I was coming in, [and] I’ll know who I am.

Alongside family and supporters, Best Buddies International celebrated 20 years of friendship with a carnival at noon on Saturday on Copley Lawn.
Best Buddies is a nonprofit organization that was started by Anthony Kennedy Shriver (COL ’88) while he was a student here at Georgetown in 1989. Its mission is to facilitate one-on-one friendships between men and women with intellectual or developmental disabilities and their peers, while encouraging equity in the workplace and societal inclusion of all people regardless of ability.
With a dunk tank, arts and crafts, a barbecue and performances by Chimes, Phantoms, Irish Dance Club, GU Pep Band and Hawaiian Club for guests to enjoy, about 200 people attended the event, including Best Buddies members and their families. Best Buddies chapters from other schools such as University of Maryland and American University also were in attendance.
Shriver, the keynote speaker of the event, emphasized the need for the mission of Best Buddies to spread to other universities, high schools and communities throughout the country and the entire world. He also shared his goal to create an environment in which people with intellectual disabilities are able to receive degrees from four-year universities.
Kirsten Stone, a former Best Buddies member and a current global messenger for the Special Olympics Virginia Chapter, also delivered a brief speech.
Shriver and Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J. accepted a bench in Dahlgren Quad honoring Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Anthony’s mother. The presentation paid homage to her commitment to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, such as her work with the Special Olympics.
The first annual Eunice Kennedy Shriver Challenge will be held in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 23 of this year, with participants taking part in a 20-mile bike ride, a 5K run or a 3K walk throughout the city.
“The event was fantastic,” said Anne Kelts (COL ’11), co-activities chair and food services chair for Best Buddies. “We are really proud of the group.”

Former president of India Abdul Kalam addressed an almost full Lohrfink Auditorium Monday, calling on those in attendance to have an aim in life and to strive relentlessly to attain it.
A world-renowned scientist and the president of India from 2002 to 2007, Kalam came to Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business on Monday evening to speak not of science or of politics, but of how to approach one’s life and career. He divided his speech into the topics of life, progress, challenges and growth.
After beginning his talk with a discussion of India’s space program, Kalam went on to praise Georgetown as an institution of excellence that educates the whole person and not just the mind.
Speaking as a part of the MSB Distinguished Leaders Series, Kalam emphasized that before entering a professional career, it is essential to have a unique aim in life. Kalam related how he developed his own unique aim in life of working in flight and aeronautics as a 10-year-old boy when his schoolteacher took his class to the beach to learn how birds fly. From that point on, Kalam said he knew he wanted to fly.
“It is a matter of great privilege that you are all a part of an institution [that] is known all over the world for the knowledge and enlightenment it provides. It is now your duty to make the best use of the resources [at Georgetown] . Knowledge will give you greatness and will help you to accomplish difficult missions in life,” Kalam said.
Kalam went on to talk of the value of hard work and perseverance as he drew on his own education experience at the Madras Institute of Technology and on his work with the Indian space program. Kalam also described the character of a leader and addressed his message specifically to the MSB students pursuing a major in management. He said that a true leader is someone who takes responsibility in the face of failure and attributes all his success to his team members.
Kalam concluded his remarks by asking students in the audience how they will be remembered.
“What would you like to be remembered for? … Will you be remembered for creating one of the top Fortune 500 companies? … Will you be remembered for doubling the food production of the world?” Kalam said.
Following his speech, the former president took a number of questions and was pressed on issues such as India’s education system, the Indian-Pakistani relationship and India’s future economic development. When asked how Indian students studying in the United States could help their homeland, Kalam said that they must learn the skill of entrepreneurship in the United States as a means of spawning jobs when they return home.
“Come to India not as the employment seeker but as the employment generator,” Kalam said.
Ishana Rai (MSB ’10), a native of New Delhi, said that Kalam’s advice about becoming an “employment generator” was the best line of his talk. She was also impressed by Kalam’s very direct responses to the students’ questions, especially when a student brought up the issue of India’s relationship with Pakistan.
Ronak Parikh (MSB ’12) shared Rai’s sentiments and admired the way Kalam did not dance around issues, though he said Kalam had to retain a political role.
“He is very tactful. He answers in a clear-cut way and doesn’t dance around a lot of questions, but he’s very political as obviously he has to be,” Parikh said.

Rain and strong winds were not enough to deter students from attending Georgetown’s fourth annual Relay For Life this weekend, which could amass the highest fundraising amount among colleges and universities nationwide once the final numbers are tallied.
Nearly 3,000 participants comprising 205 teams attended the event from Friday into Saturday morning, despite less than ideal weather conditions. Based at MultiSport Facility, participants circled the makeshift track throughout the night to raise money for the American Cancer Society.
The Georgetown community has raised $332,127.13 to date, and event chair Megan Quail (COL ’10) said she hopes to hit the $400,000 mark, a sum that may top the nation’s colleges and universities, by the end of the fiscal year in August.
Cousins Sheila Reynolds (NHS ’10) and Suzanne Joyce (COL ’10) have been co-captains together for the past four years. This year, their relay team “Freshman 15” came out on top among teams, raising $19,711 for the ACS.
“Having lost family members very close to us motivates us to participate in Relay For Life year after year,” Reynolds said. “Being the captain of the top fundraising team is very special to us; our team members did unbelievable jobs raising money for the American Cancer Society.”
The pair’s Class of 2010 has witnessed the event evolve here since Georgetown’s first Relay For Life four years ago.
“I was very happy with Relay For Life this year. Each year has been different and wonderful in [its] own way, and it has been exciting to see the progression of the event since it started four years ago,” Reynolds said.
For Quail, the 12-hour event served to unite the campus against cancer. Her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2001, and continues the battle today. She said she relays to take a stand against the disease and raise money for a cure.
“We take a full night’s sleep away from our busy schedules to symbolize that cancer never sleeps so neither will we,” Quail said. “I’m constantly amazed by the [unity] that comes along with our event, and Relay For Life of Georgetown is truly the biggest event on campus.”
Rachel Carrig (COL ’13), logistics committee member, signed up for Relay For Life knowing she wanted to be Georgetown’s top individual fundraiser. She succeeded by raising $10,345, and said she hopes to surpass that threshold next year and continue to raise money for a cure to a disease that has impacted her life.
“My mom passed away from breast cancer in 2005, when I was in eighth grade, and her sister was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2008, but luckily she is now in remission,” Carrig said. “So not only do I relay for them, but also for my future family, and that they will never have to live in fear of cancer affecting them.”
Relay For Life has come a long way since 1986 when the first Relay consisted of 19 teams and raised $33,000. According to the Relay For Life Web site, each year more than 3.5 million people in 5,000 communities in the United States along with additional communities in 20 other countries gather to take part in this global fight against cancer.
While raising over $300,000 is rare for universities, Hoyas do not seem to be surprised. Relay participant Michael Crouch (MSB ’13) said the magnitude of the event is characteristic of the philanthropic nature of the student body.
“We are Georgetown,” Crouch said. “This is what we do best.”

The narratives may vary, but members of the Georgetown community from immigrant backgrounds have all found notes of uncertainty and unexpected limitations in their American experience.
“Despite your legal status you continue to be an alien in someone else’s land, and unfortunately few differentiate between legal and illegal immigrants. Your accomplishments continue to be seen in doubt, and it seems you are in a constant war trying to prove your position in society,” said Daniel Rico (GRD ’10), assistant outreach coordinator in the Center for Latin American Studies.
The path to permanent residency is complex, demanding application through a family member, employment, investment, the diversity lottery, asylum or some provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, according to Rico.
“Currently, the fees to become a resident or citizen are too high,” said Yasmin Serrato (SFS ’13), a first-generation American whose parents went through the process for legal residency. “Financial barriers should not cause individuals who desire to live in this country to live in fear.”
About 40 million foreign-born people live in the United States today. Of those, 11 million are unauthorized, according to B. Lindsay Lowell, director of policy studies at Georgetown’s Institute for the Study of International Migration. According to the Department of Homeland Security, there were 1,130,818 legal permanent residents in the United States in 2009.
According to Rico, whether one is a permanent resident or an undocumented immigrant, perception can be a roadblock, a point he illustrated by offering the example of his own college acceptance.
“When I was accepted to Georgetown University I faced heavy criticisms from some community members back home. They did not believe that an immigrant, especially one coming from an uneducated family, could be accepted to a school like Georgetown,” Rico said. “It became such a big issue that there was actually an attempt to prove that I had somehow forged my application.”
Juan Gomez (MSB ’11) has been faced with a more precarious situation in proving his own standing since he first set foot on U.S. soil when he was a one-year-old.
Gomez considers himself an American, but his legal status is not as straightforward. His parents were deported to Colombia in an early-morning immigration raid in 2007 – a story that caught the attention of national news outlets such as The Washington Post – and though he and his brother are permitted to stay in the United States under an order of supervision, they are barred from exiting the country. His parents remain in Colombia.
While Gomez is enrolled at Georgetown as an international student, he is required to apply to the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services in order to return home to Miami for semester breaks; he isn’t sure where he would live if denied.
“There is always the fear of uncertainty,” Gomez said.
Gomez attended a local community college before transferring to Georgetown, as in-state four-year schools were not an option due to lacking financial resources, Gomez said. At community college, U.S. citizens pay $80 per credit. Gomez, who officially attended as an international student, paid $330. He said that when he applied to Georgetown as a transfer student, he received a generous financial aid package, making possible his matriculation in fall 2008.
Illegal immigrants are allowed to attend public school from kindergarten through high school, and 50,000 to 70,000 graduate from high schools each year. But many college applications ask for legal residence status. In addition, even if illegal immigrants apply as international students, they often do not have the same access to financial aid. 
Lisa He (SFS ’11), president of the Asian American Student Association, said she believes that immigration reform directly affects the Asian community, in addition to other groups on campus.
“We take this issue greatly to our hearts because 40 percent of the immigration community composes of Asian Pacific Islanders,” she said. “And of that 40 percent, 1.8 million have used illegal ways to reach to America. This alarming statistic thus demonstrates that there is a large undocumented community of Asians in the U.S.”
The numbers are so steep because gaining entry to the U.S. legally can be a taxing process, according to many from immigrant backgrounds. Michael Appau (COL ’13) came to the United States after living in Ghana for 14 years. Appau, a permanent resident card holder, considers himself lucky to have had a less challenging time gaining citizenship than some of his relatives and friends back in Ghana.
“It was [easy] to some extent. My parents had to apply for me . and they had to do a lot of paperwork to acquire citizenship. On my end, it just involved me taking a DNA test, and a lot of other shots because I guess they thought I was a leper,” Appau added lightly. “I was really lucky because my parents had all the required documents already so I didn’t have it as hard as some people I knew who really struggled to get the documentation.”
Last month, over a hundred Georgetown students marched for immigration reform on the National Mall. Supporters hope that changes in U.S. immigration policies are imminent, since the Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America’s Security and Prosperity Act hit the floor of the House in December 2009. Among the proposals is a change in tuition fees for prospective college students who are undocumented.
Supporters of the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, which is embedded in the new legislation, cite the potential for states to offer in-state tuition fees to students who are illegal immigrants. The DREAM Act would also allow students who entered the United States before the age of 15 the opportunity to become citizens through a multi-step process, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.
The College Board, which is made up of 5,600 schools and colleges, has voiced its support of the DREAM Act, which had first appeared in the House in March 2009 before its inclusion in December’s legislation.
“The College Board is working to remove the barriers to a college education for all students. Undocumented students deserve the same chance to go to college and fully participate in our society as other students,” Gaston Caperton, the organization’s president, said in a news release in April 2009. “We must not turn our back on these deserving young people.”
The legislation first pitched in December would also offer assurance to undocumented families threatened by the prospect of separation.
Gomez voiced his strong support, saying he hopes for comprehensive immigration reform that would allow his parents to re-enter the country. Under the current system, they must wait until 2017 to reapply to enter the country legally. Gomez plans to stay in the States after finishing his college education, but he hopes to be reunited with his family, pending a sea-change in immigration policy.
With activists at the grassroots level taking a stand, Rico thinks the chances of passage could swell.
“Many organizations have demonstrated that they are able to mobilize not only illegal, but also legal immigrants and sympathizers. The most recent rallies demonstrate that this issue is of great importance and that by ignoring it, you are ignoring the needs and demands of millions of people,” Rico said. “Most importantly, the national rallies have demonstrated that this issue has the potential to unite people across states.”
Ana Cenaj (COL ’12), who grew up in Albania, expects to be receiving her U.S. citizenship this year. Cenaj said that as a minority student she has felt welcomed at Georgetown.
“I’m proud of my Albanian heritage and of my identity,” she said. “I find that when people focus so much on stereotypes they often lose sight in the beauty that surrounds them. Georgetown is a beautiful and open-minded community that provides its students with a sense of individuality and diversity that is truly admirable.”

On the 235th anniversary of the battles of Lexington and Concord, gun rights advocates took up arms against the government, gathering outside Washington, D.C., in order to voice support for their right to bear arms.
About 50 individuals arrived at Ford Hunt National Park and Gravelly Point National Park in Virginia for the “Restore the Constitution Rally,” with unloaded assault rifles strapped to their backs. These areas are close to Washington, D.C., where it is legal to carry weapons. Rally organizers made sure all firearms had their safeties activated and took other precautions mandated by the Virginia state government, according to The Washington Post.
Restore the Constitution, the group hosting the rally, said that it did not believe that the presence of firearms made its demonstration especially dangerous.
“What we’re doing is not nearly as scary as how citizens inside Washington, D.C., are denied their God-given, constitutional right to keep and bear arms while armed and lawless thugs roam free,” Daniel Almond, a member of Muster Outside DC, said on his Web site.
Pro-gun speakers from across the nation addressed the various groups present at the rally.
The second rally, called the “Second Amendment March,” began at the Washington Monument. Because this protest took place within the bounds of the District, the protesters were not allowed to carry firearms. Rally organizers strongly discouraged protesters from bringing firearms, requesting that they have “a peaceful march,” and requesting those who would not comply not to attend the march.
Kevin Preskenis (COL ’12), the chief of staff of the College Republicans, recognized the importance of their cause, even if he found the method of protest jarring.
“It goes without saying that brandishing a loaded firearm is a dramatic demonstration, but this sort of activity tends to arise when individual privileges are marginalized or vilified by our elected officials. Americans are frustrated. Some are angry. Instead of turning a blind eye, government should listen,” Preskenis said in an e-mail.
Bryan Woll (COL ’12), the president of the College Democrats, was shocked by the nature of the protests, however.
“This demonstration and [those] similar to it are disturbing on a number of levels. . [The protesters] are essentially using these weapons as props of fear and anger, meant to very clearly threaten those who support the policies that these demonstrators disagree with. . This brazen flaunting of guns shows the ignorance of many to the plight of violence-plagued cities and neighborhoods throughout the nation,” Woll wrote in an e-mail.
Jacob Clark (SFS ’13) said he saw both sides of the issue.
“On the one hand, the protesters are fully within their rights, and they’ve done nothing wrong. On the other, though, almost 90 percent of the country have already made up their minds [about gun control] and won’t change their minds because of this. Indeed, they might have managed to scare some supporters off by taking such a radical route,” Clark said.
