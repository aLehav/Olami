Open dialogue and intercultural engagement can mend social flaws exposed by last month’s events in Charlottesville, Va., argued campus religious leaders at a series of panels hosted in Gaston Hall on Tuesday.
Charlottesville was the scene of violent confrontations early August, where a planned white nationalist rally opposing the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee clashed violently with counterprotesters, leading to the death of three people.
As part of the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs’ “Charlottesville and Beyond: Bending Toward Social Justice” discussion, panelists analyzed the intersection of religion and social tensions within U.S. communities.
Berkley Center Director Shaun Casey said the Charlottesville protests call into question the connection between white evangelicalism and bigotry.
“Charlottesville shines a bright light on the status of white supremacy in the white evangelical community,” Casey said. “There is the question of how much are these movements driven by different forms of white evangelical theology.”
Casey said President Donald Trump’s administration’s exclusive reliance on advice and counsel from the White House Evangelical Advisory Board for policy issues related to race is problematic. Following the violence in Charlottesville, Trump was harshly criticized by members of Congress from both parties, his own business and manufacturing advisers and media figures for not immediately and unequivocally condemning white supremacy.
“With a couple exceptions, all of the members of that board have been silent with respect to criticizing the president’s moral equivalence that he continues to draw between the neo-Nazis and the citizens of Charlottesville who were there in counterprotest,” Casey said.
Dialogue and support within religious communities is crucial to fight racism, according to Rabbi Rachel Gartner, director of Jewish Chaplaincy; history and African-American studies professor Marcia Chatelain; and Berkley Center Fellow Terrence Johnson.
Chatelain said religious leaders should foster support for those who take a stand and create a community of respect, love and support for members who may experience hate.
“I can tell someone who worships with me, ‘you should fight racism,’ but when a cross is burned in front of your house for being an ally, or you are badmouthed at work, or people on the internet threaten your life, the strength of that community has to provide you with something,” Chatelain said.
Gartner stressed the importance of introspection in coming to terms with social challenges.
“One of the responses I’ve seen is to turn inward and say: ‘How have we benefitted from the systems of racism in our country?’ And to, as we look at ourselves, remind ourselves in community that we have the resilience to be able to be self-examining and self-critical and ask hard questions,” Gartner said.
Johnson said those affected by discrimination, such as the African-American community, are struggling to find the way to mend the underlying social issues motivating bigotry and racism.
“A number of African-American churches are trying to figure out: ‘How do I make sense of this brokenness?’ particularly the brokenness they are seeing in their communities, and how to link that to institutional work that must be done at the federal and state level,” Johnson said.
The panelists insisted that open engagement among communities was essential for widespread change.
Casey highlighted the need to appeal to centrist and progressive members within the white evangelical community.
“We need to see behavior that exhibits a different view of race that repudiates white supremacy,” Casey said.
Chatelain said universities should foster open, safe spaces and prevent inflammatory, provocative speakers from receiving a platform and justifying such invitations on the grounds of free speech.
“The biggest lie that we tell ourselves about universities is that they are open spaces. We constantly discriminate as universities,” Chatelain said. “But when a troll Nazi wants to come to our campus, we start believing that these are free and open spaces for everyone.”
“The people who have professionalized the practice of mayhem; they don’t engage,” Chatelain said.
Johnson reaffirmed his commitment to creating spaces in which all voices could be heard so that all perspectives contributed to the community.
“I want to encourage students to stop saying you can’t say something, because my fear is that, that then creates a kind of impact that we can’t get beyond and that kind of reinforces your privilege in the classroom,” Johnson said. “It allows you to say you don’t have to participate in rebuilding the community.”
Advising that background did not determine political views, the panelists warned against stereotypes and closed-mindedness.
“When the conversation is happening we have to resist the simplicity, we have to resist these inevitability arguments: ‘Because you are poor that means you will hate immigrants, because you are struggling it means you think that children should not have health care,’” Chatelain said.
“White resentment is not inevitability,” Chatelain said. “White resentment is a choice among many choices, of how you want to express yourself in the world.”

Multiple swastikas were found painted inside an LXR Hall women’s restroom, alongside language threatening violence against women, in two separate incidents Wednesday night and Thursday morning.
The swastika with misogynistic threats was first found painted inside the stall of a second-floor LXR women’s restroom Wednesday night. The graffiti was reported to the Georgetown University Police Department, which increased patrols in the areas around residence halls after the incident.
A second, similar act of vandalism was discovered in the same room the next day. A university spokesperson said GUPD has increased surveillance in LXR and is investigating the incidents with the help of the Metropolitan Police Department.
“Perpetrators will be held fully responsible, in conjunction with Georgetown’s Code of Conduct. They could face additional criminal charges following the GUPD and MPD’s investigation of these incidents,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown University strongly condemns acts of hatred, racism, bigotry, anti-Semitism, sexism, and Islamophobia.”
The incidents mark the third and fourth occurrences of anti-Semitic graffiti this semester. Three of the four instances were in LXR common areas and involved swastikas painted in red.
Two swastikas were previously found painted inside an LXR elevator Sept. 6, and one swastika was found carved onto the wall of a Village C West elevator the day before.
A group of students responded to Wednesday night’s incident with messages of solidarity written in chalk in Red Square — a “countergraffiti” effort organized early Thursday morning by members of the Jewish Student Alliance.
JSA President Claire Goldberg (COL ’19) said she was in bed when she was woken by texts from Jewish friends about the incident.
“At first, it was like, ‘How did I know it was this again?’” Goldberg said. “A couple people came up with the idea of countergraffiti. Something positive. Something to show Jews at Georgetown are not going to sit back and whimper when something like this happens. And we will not be weak, and we will not be victimized by some punk in LXR.”
In a campuswide email condemning Wednesday night’s incident, University President John J. DeGioia called it an “abhorrent act of anti-Semitism.”
“There is never a time or place for these acts, and this incident is even more disturbing during Rosh Hashanah. We stand in solidarity with our Jewish community and strongly condemn this act of hate, anti-Semitism, and sexism,” DeGioia wrote. “Those found responsible for these acts of hate will be held fully accountable for their actions.”
DeGioia reiterated calls for students to report any relevant information to campus police and report any future bias-related incidents.
Kamar Mack (COL ’19), president of the Georgetown University Student Association, called for the expulsion of any student or students found responsible for the vandalism in a statement, writing that the move would “send a message that Georgetown does not tolerate acts of hatred on our campus.”
“Frustratingly, this cycle of anti-Semitism and condemnation has become routine on our campus over the last few weeks,” Mack wrote.
GUSA also plans to collaborate with GUPD to “promote a ‘See Something, Say Something’ culture” on campus and develop more programming for interreligious understanding.
“Most importantly, we invite Jewish students and all other students to let us know how else we can best support you and be your partner in bringing about change on campus,” Mack wrote.
At least eight bias-related incidents were announced by email to the university community in the 2016-17 academic year, including anti-Semitic graffiti found near the Makóm Jewish gathering space in Leavey Center in May, the removal of Muslim and Hindu flyers from chaplain-in-residence bulletin boards in March and two reported off-campus assaults on students wearing hijabs in November.
This is a developing story. This post will be updated as more information becomes available.

Another hoax.
[…] first night of the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah on Sept. 20, the Georgetown community discovered several graffiti with anti-Semitic and misogynistic messages painted on a restroom in LXR Hall. Last spring, fliers […]

Universities can learn from Georgetown’s initiatives to empower women, such as sexual assault awareness and prevention programs, as well as the Institute for Women, Peace and Security, explained university president John J. DeGioia at a United Nations Women event Wednesday morning.
Speaking at the third-year anniversary celebration of UN Women’s HeForShe campaign launch, DeGioia discussed GIWPS’ ongoing project measuring female participation in peacebuilding efforts around the world and the university’s response to campus sexual assault.
HeForShe is a global initiative launched by UN Women in 2014 to research best practices, implement policy changes to empower women and engage men and boys as allies in gender equity.
DeGioia is one of two U.S. university presidents who were named IMPACT champions in 2016, while Georgetown and Stony Brook University in New York are the two American universities researching and testing gender equity policies on their campuses.
Speaking on the sidelines of the 2017 United Nations General Assembly, he shared the stage with Vittorio Colao, CEO of the Vodafone Group, and moderator Susanna Schrobsdorff, columnist and Chief Strategic Partnerships Editor for TIME.
The panel discussions hosted in New York City centered on HeForShe’s latest IMPACT 10x10x10 Gender Parity Report, which highlighted the tactics and policies that HeForShe’s corporate, governmental and education allies, called IMPACT Champions, are taking around the world.
The 2017 report, released Wednesday morning, commended Georgetown for its efforts to also counter gender-based violence on its own campus through sexual assault prevention and healthy relationship education programs, specifically, the “Bringing in the Bystander” program for first-year students.
“Sexual assault is not an issue that can be tackled solely with a top-down approach,” the report reads. “We need to engage all members of our community in order to understand the full scope of the problem and work towards solutions.”
The report signaled support for student-led initiatives to counter sexual assault, such as efforts to institutionalize support for survivors and consolidate information about resources for survivors of sexual assault or misconduct like “How to Get Help,” a guide to resources at Georgetown.
The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security — the founding of which was inspired by former President Barack Obama’s 2011 executive order mandating women representation in all U.S. negotiating teams — is collaborating closely with the Norway-based Oslo Center, a think tank dedicated to advancing world peace, human rights and inter-religious dialogue, to rank countries based on their female population’s contribution to national stability.
“We’re developing a global index,” DeGioia said. “We’re working together with the Norwegian government, with the Oslo Center, with support of the government of Norway, to develop an index that will enable us to rank nations in the contribution that women are making to ensuring peace and security in their nations.”
This project represents GIWPS’ most recent effort to promote the inclusion of women in security efforts, DeGioia said.
“We’ve been able to do case studies in Northern Ireland, in Tunisia, in the Philippines, most recently in Colombia. [There is] irrefutable proof of the significant role women must play in peacebuilding,” DeGioia said. “We are establishing the case for the role of women in peacebuilding and in security.”
DeGioia said involving women in peacebuilding initiatives leads to more thorough and substantive results.
“We will be able to achieve goals that we could not imagine if we just try to do it in an exclusive way,” DeGioia said. “The more inclusive we can be, the more diversity we can celebrate, the more women are central and connected to everything that we do, the more success we will have.”

The Anti-Defamation League awarded its 2017 Achievement award to University President John J. DeGioia on Monday, the highest award bestowed in Washington, D.C. by the Jewish advocacy and civil rights organization.
ADL National Director Jonathan Greenblatt and D.C. Regional Director Doron Ezickson noted the opening of Georgetown’s Center for Jewish Civilization in 2016 and his collaboration with the ADL to establish the Bearing Witness program, which trains Catholic school educators to teach students about the history of anti-Semitism.
They also acknowledged DeGioia’s public stances against two of President Donald Trump’s major policies: An executive order banning refugees and travel from six Muslim-majority countries and the termination of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
DeGioia has openly pushed back against the Trump administration’s elimination of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected 800,000 young students without documentation from deportation. DeGioia called the terminiation of DACA “unconscionable” in a campuswide email, and has personally lobbied members of Congress to pass a permanent legislative replacement for the program.
The university is also offering legal support for students applying for protected status before the October deadline and called for students and alumni to join the push for a legislative fix.
In January, DeGioia led the university’s efforts against the travel ban, currently being challenged in the Supreme Court by refugee rights organizations and others affected by the temporary ban. The university signed onto an amicus brief arguing against the ban March 6 in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, with oral arguments set to begin next month.
Speakers also commended DeGioia’s work convening the Working Group on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation in 2015 to reconcile with the university’s historical involvement with slavery. At the working group’s recommendation, the university apologized for its connections to slavery in April, renamed two residence halls for slaves formerly owned by the university and offered legacy status to slave descendant applicants.
The ADL awards prominent members of the Washington, D.C. community for their involvement with civil and educational rights issues and their work that furthers the mission of the ADL. Past recipients include President and CEO of Medstar Health Kenneth A. Samet and David Trone, CEO of Total Wine and More.
The organization was founded in 1913 to combat anti-Semitism and infringements on civil rights, with the intention of carrying out the mission “to stop the defamation of the Jewish people” and “to secure justice and fair treatment to all.”
Ezickson said the ADL has enjoyed a lasting partnership with Georgetown, particularly under DeGioia’s leadership. DeGioia has been “committed to dialogue in a very serious level about differences in our society, about pulling people together,” Ezickson said.
The Bearing Witness program was cited at the reception as one of the first collaborations between Georgetown and the ADL. The program was created in 1995 by the university, the ADL and other partners to provide training and resources to Catholic educators on the history of anti-Semitism. The program has trained more than 1,900 educators since its creation, according to the ADL.
Ted Leonsis (COL’77), owner of Monumental Sports and Entertainment and a child of Greek immigrants, commended DeGioia’s active response to DACA, saying the effort struck a personal chord.
“Some of the things that have been happening in the last month have made me go from being apolitical to having a loud voice. When I spoke to Jack and told him that we should talk about this, he goes ‘I got it. I’m representing higher education. We are working spiritually, legally. We got it,’” Leonsis said. “Whenever there is a person that you need to do the right thing, the right way, instinctively, we all look to Jack DeGioia.”
Greenblatt also praised the university’s response to anti-Semitic bias-related incidents on campus and in the District, including two incidents of swastikas found in residence hall elevators earlier this month. University officials responded to each of the incidents in campuswide emails condemning hatred and anti-Semitism.
“Now unfortunately in this moment, we’ve seen an outbreak of anti-Semitism across the country like a virus,” Greenblatt said. “Anti-Semitic incidents are up here in the District of Columbia, our nation’s capital. Then rare is it that I find a university president who moves as swiftly and as strongly as Jack to denounce these incidents on campus.”
Accepting the award, DeGioia said there is always more work to be done to improve the experiences of marginalized members of our community.
“There is no more urgent question facing our world than this: How do we understand our responsibilities to one another? We look at the ADL to guide our way,” DeGioia said. “You have provided an enduring model of what it means to seek an ever-more just society and you have empowered a set of resources from which all of us can draw as we seek to address manifestations of injustice in our world.”
Greenblatt ended by saying DeGioia was being honored not only for his actions, but also for his vision, values, honor and humility.
“The ADL Achievement Award is given not to those who have just made an impression, but to those who have worked for a larger impact, to contribute to our nation, to our society, to shape our communities, to touch our lives and those of our children,” Greenblatt said. “Because the world in which we live is so haunted by intolerance, it’s still plagued by injustice, it’s still infected by inhumanity.”

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel spoke to students Tuesday night about the party’s goals for gaining millennials’ support and current issues including the recent end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
The event was hosted in the Healey Family Student Center by the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service and co-sponsored by the Georgetown University College Republicans. The talk was moderated by GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee.
Regarding DACA, McDaniel said Congress must find a permanent legal solution to protect the students without documentation who were previously protected under the Obama-era policy eliminated this month by President Donald Trump’s administration, while also focusing on controlling the border.
“You’ve got 800,000 people in limbo. I think, no matter what, Congress needs to deal with this some way or another and create at least some policy that does not leave those people in limbo,” McDaniel said.
McDaniel, who comes from a family of active Republicans and is the niece of former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said the party needs to earn college students’ votes by showing up on campuses and making their case directly to younger voters.
“Overall, the party needs to show up, and that’s something we’re focused on — creating college Republicans chapters on campuses,” McDaniel said. “We have to start showing up and bringing that conversation to campuses, because maybe you’re a Republican and you don’t know it. Maybe you’ve never thought about it. Maybe there are things you think about the Republican Party that aren’t right.”
Elleithee asked McDaniel about the core principles of the Republican Party in the Trump era, how the party plans to market itself to millennials and how the different “brands” of Republicans are all connected.
McDaniel also noted that millennials are less responsive to traditional campaign methods than past generations. She said the Republican Party should rally millennials to their cause using tools like social media.
McDaniel said the country’s deep political divide has halted the Republican party’s agenda, and she called on Congress to work together in a bipartisan way.
“We started this presidency probably with the most division in this country that I’ve ever seen,” McDaniel said. “If you’re never going to have a bipartisan effort on anything, you’re not going to get things done.”
Finally, McDaniel advocated for more dialogue in the future between people of opposing beliefs, and said that only this will bring the nation together.
“Any time somebody is feeling like they cannot speak and they cannot share what they think in this country, then our country is going in the wrong direction,” McDaniel said.
