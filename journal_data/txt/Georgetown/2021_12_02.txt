Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies (SCS) students voted in favor of completing the transition toward fully incorporating the school into the university’s student government bodies.
The Georgetown University Graduate Student Government held the referendum from Nov. 15 to Nov. 22, which received a total of 491 votes from 16.4% of the student body, of which 89.2% of students voted in favor of the referendum. The executive board will ask the senate to recognize this result at a Dec. 3 meeting. This will complete the transitional period of incorporating the SCS into the senate that began three months ago when 46 senate positions were first offered to SCS students.
Students in the SCS are enthusiastic to join the GradGov bodies, according to Sam Hymes (MBA ’23, MPS ’23), GradGov’s director of communications.
“SCS students are dedicated and hard working who deserve a voice,” Hymes wrote in an email to The Hoya. “GradGov has been very positive about adding members of SCS. More than half of my Communications Committee are SCS students and have worked tremendously hard for GradGov and their respective programs.”
The referendum, which only included the question of whether students wanted to pay the $18 graduate student activities fee to join GradGov and participate in all the organization’s affairs, including attending all events, running for executive positions and joining committees in the bodies’ senate, was open to current SCS students for voting from Nov. 15 to Nov. 22. 
Since not many SCS students were familiar with GradGov before this semester, it took a lot of work to promote this vote across the school, according to Kelly Otter, dean of the SCS.
“Close coordination was necessary not only because of the tight timeline of the referendum vote, but also because for many SCS students the mission and purpose of GradGov was still relatively new,” Otter wrote in an email to The Hoya. “To that end, the GradGov leadership team worked closely with the SCS Dean’s Office, Marketing, and Academic Operations departments to push out appropriate messaging in school-wide emails, programmatic newsletters, TV screens on campus, and on social media.”
The passage of the referendum represented a turning point for the SCS, according to Jonah Klempner (LAW ’22, GRD ’22), president of GradGov.
“This was a huge inflection point for how the administration is going to view the School of Continuing Studies as for what the students there are looking for and what Georgetown owes to them,” Klempner said in an interview with The Hoya. “If these students are coming here not just for a credential but for an experience then Georgetown needs to deliver, and the School of Continuing Studies administration themselves has been doing a really good job creating that community.”
SCS students have shown excitement throughout the election process about involvement in GradGov, according to Otter.
“SCS students are excited about opportunities to engage with the larger GU community, and GradGov provides a great infrastructure for this,” Otter wrote. “The GradGov leadership and inaugural group of SCS Senators were tremendous champions of the effort to make SCS an official part of the organization. Their drive and dedication was a vital part of the success of the initiative, something we are very grateful for!”
The SCS students demonstrated through their votes that they expect more than just coursework from their student experience, according to Klempner.
“They showed that in this referendum that they are here to be students, not just here to get this credential,” Klempner said. “They’re here for the graduate student community. They’re here for the student experience and Georgetown, after you know we had one out of seven of them come out and vote affirmatively. There was nothing else on the ballot. There’s no other reason for a student to vote besides this because nobody was running.”
There was no prior representation of the SCS in any graduate student bodies before this semester, according to Klempner.
“Before this, the School of Continuing Studies didn’t have any representation at all,” Klempner said. “They didn’t really have a voice in the administration. In almost every conversation I was in for years people were like talking about them without them being there and making decisions for them without them being there. It was very odd.”
This referendum highlights GradGov’s continued efforts to improve students’ experiences and the Georgetown community, according to Hymes.
“GradGov has been determined to make a strong impact in the community,” Hymes wrote. “We have already done many impactful things to help enhance the student experience at Georgetown. It’s only the beginning and we are far from done.”

Students from the Georgetown University Medical Center’s Center for Global Health Science and Security and the School of Foreign Service’s Center for Latin American Studies (CLAS) will publish their final update to an interactive map detailing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America and the Caribbean on Dec. 6.   
Since the start of the pandemic, a group of eight undergraduate and graduate student researchers has worked on the Latin America and Caribbean COVID-19 Map, which allows viewers to explore the effects of the pandemic in the two regions on three parameters: governance and the rule of law, growth and innovation, and social and cultural inclusion. 
After field research was canceled because of travel restrictions in the spring of 2020, CLAS switched its focus entirely to examine the impact of the pandemic in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to Angelo Rivero Santos, the director of academic affairs at CLAS.
“Over the past few months, we have realized that governments are trying to adjust not only to deal with the pandemic but to build with the social, economic, cultural, political consequences of the pandemic,” Santos said in an interview with The Hoya.
Accessing reliable sources, particularly in smaller countries and among historically excluded populations, has proven difficult, according to Santos.
“You are depending on networks, on contacts, on the creativity of the researcher to find information in the local languages,” Santos said. “That has been a challenge but also a wonderful experience. It exposes our students to the challenges of doing research in a pandemic.”
The team has worked to navigate issues with compiling data, according to Alexander Cordovés (SFS ’22), a member of the spring 2020 team who aided in building the website and now works to edit the website’s Spanish content. 
“We use primary sources from newspapers from the countries, journals. Because most of us don’t actually live in the region,” Cordovés said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “I am a native Spanish speaker but that is not the case of the entire team. And, we are not only talking about Spanish in the region: Portuguese, French and Dutch are also spoken in Latin America and the Caribbean. In making sure that our sources are correct, complete and unbiased, we need to make sure that we are first familiar with the language.”
CLAS has been particularly focused on highlighting the effects of low vaccination rates in these regions, according to Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., the director of CLAS.
“In Latin America, rates of vaccination are still much lower. And they vary tremendously across the region. This is a pressing urgent public health issue in a way that sometimes we can forget here. One of the things that keeps us motivated about it is paying attention to how important this is in the region,” Carnes said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Because of a lack of vaccine availability in the regions, only around 37% of people in Latin America and the Caribbean have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
The website now receives thousands of visitors per month, according to Cordovés.
“It is very gratifying to see that the map has been very useful not only in academic settings but also for information in general and for people interested in learning more about the region,” Cordovés said.
Additionally, the archival of the map’s data in the Library of Congress has made it more accessible to students, professors, universities and researchers, according to Carnes.
“Students really appreciated the chance to have something that was making a concrete contribution at this moment,” Carnes said. “Within a year of starting it, the Library of Congress had found it, and they have now archived it as one of their permanent records of what happened during the pandemic.”
The database will continue to expand and become more accessible to researchers across fields, according to Carnes.
“Once you build a database, it then becomes accessible to researchers who ask questions of it and use data from it in ways that you never envisioned,” Carnes said. “That’s what is so exciting. Whole new insights can come that we didn’t have, but we laid the groundwork for.”

A member of Georgetown University’s faculty will serve as one of the first advisors for the Benjamin A. Gilman International Program. 
The U.S. Department of State facilitates study abroad endeavors through the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program in the Institute of International Education, providing financially constrained students with opportunities to learn and intern globally. Brian Floyd, assistant dean in the School of Nursing and Health Studies (NHS), will encourage underrepresented groups to study abroad in his two-year term as advisor.
Study abroad is an opportunity for students to be exposed to diverse cultures and new experiences, according to Floyd, who hopes to expand study abroad opportunities in his new capacity as a Benjamin A. Gilman International Program Advisor. 
“Through study abroad, students are often surprised to find that they become more confident in how they present themselves in a variety of situations,” Floyd wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Not only do they learn about new cultures and obtain a more global perspective, they also get new and fresh insights into their own identity and sense of self, a more confident and purposeful self.”
The ultimate goal of advisors in the Gilman International Scholarship Program is to increase resources and support for students interested in studying abroad, according to Floyd. 
“I am excited to now take on this new role where I will have the opportunity to work directly with various leaders at the Bureau of Educational & Cultural Affairs, The Gilman Scholarship program, International Education Abroad and other higher education institutions to design and share best practices for providing and expanding not only scholarship opportunities for those underrepresented in the study abroad space but to design new, collaborative partnerships,” Floyd wrote. 
Floyd also co-teaches a first-year course for low-income and first generation first-year students called Mastering the Hidden Curriculum, which provides a support system for students and presents them with information about available resources to pursue global scholarship.
Georgetown students interested in studying abroad and becoming involved in an increasingly globalized world will benefit from Floyd’s expertise, according to Craig Rinker, director of Global Education at Georgetown. 
“Brian’s contributions have been invaluable in serving the students of Georgetown University,” Rinker wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am confident he will be a great asset in promoting international education and the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program as a means to expand global opportunities for students.”
Floyd’s experience in the NHS will help attract students from different academic disciplines to the idea of studying abroad, according to Theresa Gagnon, Gilman Program Officer at USA Study Abroad. 
“Dean Floyd demonstrates that Gilman has institutional champions on every corner of higher education campuses,” Gagnon wrote in an email to The Hoya. “His position at Georgetown University’s School of Nursing and Health Studies makes him uniquely suited to help the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program support students from health and STEM majors to understand that education abroad can fit into their academic plans despite the intense demands of their schedules.”
The university was fourth in the nation among the number of Gilman Scholars sent from medium-sized institutions since the program’s inception in 2001, with 57% of Georgetown students studying abroad. 
Despite the success of the Gilman International Scholarship Program, barriers to global education continue to persist, and it is crucial that advisors provide a network to support underrepresented students in their pursuit of global studies, according to Floyd. 
“In my experience as an advisor to underrepresented students pursuing this opportunity, it is also important that advisors must first know themselves and their comfort level addressing student diversity issues such as race, socioeconomic status, gender, sexual orientation, religious background, and then work to increase their comfort level in order to become a resource to all students, as opposed to a liability,” Floyd wrote.
When institutional barriers are so large, advisors like Floyd will provide institutional support in order to encourage underrepresented students, according to Rinker.
“Brian Floyd’s appointment to the Gilman Advisor Ambassador Program is another example of institutional support encouraging students to participate in global experiences that prepare leaders with a profound self-understanding and awareness of the nature of the world, and the role that they must play in improving it,” Rinker wrote. 
Through the Gilman International Scholarship Program, students will be able to transform the world, according to Floyd. 
“As a result, they may join others in the effort to change the world in a positive way and foster a connected international community, with an emphasis on the values of empathy and a shared humanity, and the belief that every person deserves a transformative international educational experience abroad,” Floyd wrote.

The Georgetown University McDonough School of Business’ (MSB) online Master of Science in Finance (MSF) program, a 21-month program in finance management offered in both part- and full-time formats, was ranked among the best online master’s degrees in finance.
The MSF program rose to the second place spot for the “Best Online Master’s in Finance Management Programs 2021” ranking by College Consensus, a company that publishes overall rankings based on a combined average from college ranking publishers and student review scores. The program improved from its sixth place ranking in 2020 . 
While the MSB is proud of the ranking, student success is a priority, according to Paul Almeida, dean of the MSB.
“We focus on our students, including their learning and career success, rather than on rankings,” Almeida wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Nevertheless, we are glad that the quality of our MSF program is recognized through the #2 ranking.”
The success and career achievements of students is at the core of the program’s values, according to David Allen Ammerman, director of Academic Operations of the MSF program.
“We try to do what’s going to be right for our students,” Ammerman said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We think a great deal about their career goals and career prospects and what that means in terms of the experiences they need, both academic and nonacademic. We think about how we can structure courses and deliver them in a way that’s going to be most beneficial for them, especially considering many of our students work full-time jobs, have families and they’re trying to go to school.”
Having the best quality instruction is central to the MSF’s mission, according to Allan Eberhart, senior associate dean of the MSF Program.
“When we were first thinking about this, we wanted this to be a high-quality program,” Eberhart said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “That meant, again, getting many of our best faculty to agree to teach in the program and having admission standards that were at least as good as our flagship MBA program. That was our mission from the very beginning: to focus on quality, quality, quality. We made a lot of decisions that were counter to ‘best practices’ at the time, and I think we’ve been validated in that mission. And so that’s why I think the good rankings measure that quality.”
The growth of the program is due in part to an influx of interest from recent graduates, according to Eberhart. 
“We’re seeing a lot of growth in students that are coming right out of undergrad,” Eberhart said. “Our average age is people in their late twenties, but we have probably approximately 25% of the program now.” 
At the beginning of this year, 324 students were enrolled in the MSF program, compared to only 39 students enrolled in the program when it launched in 2014, according to Eberhart. 
While the program is completely online, its cohort-based structure creates a unified class similar to in-person instruction, according to Eberhart.
“We were the first, to my knowledge, technology-intensive program that limited the number of starts to one start per year,” Eberhart said. “We made this an on-campus-like program. That’s important because it’s consistent with the cohort model. That’s a big part of our program: it allows, again, our best faculty to teach in the program. If you spread out the number of starts, you can’t attract good faculty because faculty want to concentrate their teaching over multiple sections of the same course.” 
Student experiences guide the program more than anything else, according to Ammerman.
“We have just a wide range of backgrounds represented in our student body, and so the thing we are always thinking about is what’s going to be best for our students,” Ammerman said. “We really let that guide us. If it results in good rankings so much the better, but we don’t really do it for the rankings.”

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate unanimously passed a resolution demanding longer dining hall hours for all undergraduate students at a Nov. 21 meeting. 
The resolution calls for the university to extend operating hours for the lower level of the Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall until 10 p.m., hire more employees, provide overtime pay and establish a committee on student dining. The lower level of Leo’s serves as the main dining hall for the entire student population and currently operates from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays. 
Extending operating hours would better accommodate the needs of students who are employed, have athletic or extracurricular commitments or have irregular academic schedules, according to GUSA Senator John Sussek (COL ’24), who introduced the resolution. 
“Getting a meal in should not be a challenge, and you should not have to change your schedule around the dining hall’s hours,” Sussek said in an interview with The Hoya. “In fact, the dining hall should be able, at a university of this caliber, to change its schedule to suit our hours.”
Extending dining hall hours would also help reduce the burden on students’ finances and help address food insecurity on campus, according to GUSA Senate Vice Speaker Rowlie Flores (COL ’22), who co-sponsored the resolution.
“Some students do have 6:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. classes, and by the time they get out of class, Leo’s is closed,” Flores said in an interview with The Hoya. “This year, we don’t have a lot of locations that accept Flex dollars, and having to spend your own money at Wisey’s or Uber Eats is an additional cost that students have to bear.”
Currently 15 locations on Georgetown’s main campus accept Flex dollars. 
Students must have access to food in order to prioritize their health while on campus, according to Abigail Orbe (COL ’23), president of Students Advancing Food Equity (SAFE), a student-run club that works to ensure that all Georgetown students have healthy and affordable food.
“Food is more than a biological need,” Orbe wrote in a message to The Hoya. “It deeply affects social and emotional health. All students should be able to select the food they need, in the quantity and quality they need, at the time in which they need it.”
The university chooses the current hours of operation at dining locations based on when the services are most demanded, according to a university spokesperson. 
“We welcome community feedback about on-campus dining,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The hours of on-campus dining locations are selected to best meet the needs of the campus community based on utilization rates. We regularly review information to ensure we meet the needs of the on-campus community.”
The resolution comes after semester-long concerns about the university’s requirement that all students enroll in a meal plan. The GUSA Senate passed a resolution Aug. 29 demanding cheaper meal plan options and exemption opportunities for juniors and seniors. 
While there are dining options available after 8 p.m. at Epicurean, Olive Branch and Sazón, these locations do not fully accommodate students’ dietary restrictions, according to GUSA Senator Spencer Woodall (MSB, SFS ’24). 
“We do need to increase the dining hall hours,” Woodall said in an interview with The Hoya. “People with dietary restrictions, such as people who are halal or have vegetarian or vegan constraints, are not able to be fulfilled by the upstairs dining options.”
However, Olive Branch uses entirely halal ingredients, and Sazón and Royal Jacket offer vegan options, while Royal Jacket and Bodega Market are both open past 8 p.m.   
The lower level of Leo’s is the only dining location on campus that offers unlimited meal swipes for students enrolled in the All Access 7 plan, which all first-years and sophomores are required to adopt as their campus meal plan. 
Hiring more employees to extend operating hours would also address the current issues of worker shortages, according to Sussek.
“I have spoken with several people who work at downstairs Leo’s, and they’ve all told me that they’re overworked to some capacity,” Sussek said. “We see the same faces every single day doing the same thing all day long. They’re feeding three meals a day to thousands of students.”
GUSA will continue to work on the issue of food insecurity and dining on campus, with the recent resolution being the first step in a lengthy process, according to Sussek. 
“I think we can get this done,” Sussek said. “Do I think it will happen right now, meaning this semester or next semester? Probably not, just because of the way funding and distribution of funds work. What I want to highlight is that this is by no means a finalized product. This is just the beginning stages to the changes we need.”

The U.S. Department of Education awarded a $2.6 million five-year National Professional Development (NPD) grant for a proposal aimed at providing increased resources for multilingual education.
The proposal, named the English Learners’ Educational Excellence Capitol Teacher Training Project (Project ELEECT), was created by professors in Georgetown University’s Master of Arts in Educational Transformation (MAET) program. The proposal will use the grant to support the professional development of teachers in Washington, D.C. Project ELEECT’s goals include increasing the number of multilingual teachers, expanding culturally diverse resources for multilingual students and preparing teachers to meet the needs of those students.
Project ELEECT demonstrates a commitment to increasing equity in D.C. schools by improving education for multilingual students, according to Douglas Reed, lead principal investigator (PI) of Project ELEECT and director of the MAET program.
“In this case, it’s about their linguistic abilities and the languages that they already know, and then using those strengths as assets to help them achieve what they want to achieve,” Reed said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “The program has really made a commitment to racial equity and linguistic equity, and I think this grant really validates that.”
The NPD grant, combined with university funded merit awards, will cover 83% of the tuition cost for aspiring teachers, according to a university press release. 
To confront the growing population of multilingual students in D.C., Project ELEECT will partner with D.C. Public Schools and public charter schools in the District to provide training catered to the D.C. public school sector, according to Crissa Stephens, one of the PIs for Project ELEECT.
“We’ve really developed the project also to be responsive to what’s really happening here in D.C. to what schools are telling us they need, what we’re seeing from student data about what they need and just to build a robust partnership with schools across the entire context of education in D.C.,” Stephens said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
Project ELEECT is an important continuation of the university’s role in the broader D.C. community, according to Sabrina Wesley-Nero, one of the PIs for Project ELEECT.
“Georgetown has a history of supporting schools throughout the city in different ways, particularly for the educational transformation program,” Wesley-Nero said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “What this grant allows us to do is to extend that work in teacher preparation.”
The number of multilingual learners in the United States has increased by 60% over the past decade, with students from non-English speaking backgrounds constituting 10% of students nationwide, according to a 2017 Brookings Institution report. 
The university’s partnership with D.C. public schools and public charter schools on Project ELEECT will help meet the needs of students in the region, according to Hilary Darilek, who is CEO of E.L. Haynes Public Charter School and worked with MAET in developing the professional certificate portion of Project ELEECT. 
“I really have incredible respect for Georgetown’s creativity on this front,” Darilek said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I do think universities don’t always respond quickly to the communities they serve and they work in, and they reached out to us to ask for what we need and how they could provide for and support our students’ needs, and it’s just an incredible partnership that I’m excited to start and to launch.”
Equipping teachers with the tools to support multilingual students combats inequity in English-oriented classrooms and uplifts the experiences and identities of multilingual students, according to Stephens.
“Linguistically diverse families often find themselves experiencing narratives deficit in society, and I think that’s due to many different reasons,” Stephens said. “I think that by providing instruction that really counters that and is very anti-racist in nature, it’s a way of speaking back to some of those narratives, and so it will better serve students and families. Hopefully, it will also help reshape the way that they experience their identities in the school system and in the community.”

An audit revealed over 11% of mail-in ballots were returned as undeliverable in Washington, D.C., during the 2020 general election.
The Office of the District of Columbia Auditor released “District of Columbia 2020 Election Administration” Nov. 16, the second of three reports evaluating the 2020 elections in the District. The audit details how changes the D.C. Board of Elections (DCBOE) implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the election process and voting patterns.
Of the 421,791 ballots mailed to voters in the 2020 general election, 11.4% were returned as undeliverable, marking a drastic increase in undeliverable ballots from the primary election, in which only 1.3% of ballots were returned as undeliverable. The rate of undeliverable ballots in the District for the general election was more than eight times the national average. 
Frequent population shifts and relocations contributed to the high rate of undeliverable ballots, according to Nick Jacobs, DCBOE public information officer.
“There are multiple explanations, starting with the fact that D.C. is an incredibly transient city,” Jacobs said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “People are moving in and out all the time. They’re moving around within the city, and so it’s just a factor of that.”
The comparatively high number of undeliverable ballots is due to outdated registration and address information used by the DCBOE to mail ballots to each registered voter, according to the audit.
“The high percentage of undeliverable mail ballots in the general election stands in contrast with the low percentage of such ballots in the primary election — for which voters were required to proactively request a by-mail ballot and only 1.3% of by-mail ballots were returned undeliverable,” the audit reads. “This lower percentage of undeliverable ballots evidences the necessity of ensuring registration and address information is up to date to reduce the chances of a ballot being returned undeliverable.”
The DCBOE conducts a canvas after each election to confirm voters’ information and addresses to try to avoid undeliverable ballots as a result of outdated personal information, according to Jacobs.
“We certainly do not accept it, and we want our voting rolls to be as current and accurate as possible,” Jacobs said. “That is reflected in the fact that one of the core components of our messaging is always encouraging voters to double-check their information and make sure it’s as current as possible.”
When voters neglect to update their address, universal mail-in ballots are ineffective, forcing voters to find alternative ways to cast their ballot and defeating the purpose of encouraging absentee voting to protect the health of voters and election workers, according to Jacobs.
“It is incumbent upon the voter to return those mailers and confirm their information,” Jacobs said. “Unfortunately, that doesn’t always happen there too. That’s reflective of the numbers that we saw in 2020 that despite our best efforts in the last election and the canvas right after that, voters don’t always take it seriously.”
The pandemic forced the DCBOE to adapt its voting methods for the 2020 election, shifting from prioritizing in-person voting to encouraging mail-in and drop-off options to protect the health of both voters and election workers.
During the 2020 primary election, DCBOE received a record high of over 90,000 absentee ballots, leading to difficulties processing ballots, staff shortages and long lines at polling centers. In an effort to increase accessibility for the general election, an act passed by the Council of the District of Columbia requiring the DCBOE to mail every registered voter an absentee ballot and postage-paid return envelope in advance of the Nov. 3 election went into effect in December 2020. 
One of the most effective ways to avoid a high number of ballots being returned as undeliverable in future elections is for voters to check their registration and confirm the correct addresses, according to Jacobs.
“We put our best efforts forward to make sure that the rolls are as accurate as possible,” Jacobs said. “But at the same time, the voters have to meet us halfway and have to accept their role and fulfill their role in keeping information as accurate as possible.”

Washington, D.C. council members voted unanimously Nov. 16 to rename a Petworth-area elementary school after the late Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) (H ’15) to honor the legacy of his civil and human rights achievements. 
Joseph Rodman West Elementary School will be renamed in honor of Lewis following a recommendation from the District of Columbia Facilities and Commemorative Expressions (DCFACES) Working Group. Formed in 2020 by D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser (D), DCFACES evaluates government-owned facilities and recommends changes if the facility’s namesake is inconsistent with D.C. values, or either encourages the oppression of Black Americans and other communities of color or contributes to the United States’ history of systemic racism. 
The bill renaming the elementary school is now up for mayoral review, with Bowser expected to codify the act into law.
DCFACES’ report, released in August 2020, recommended renaming 21 District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) schools and school buildings, including West Elementary. Their report’s recommendations stemmed from multiple sources and community engagement methods, including a virtual town hall.
In DCFACES’ web survey completed by 2,300 residents, 80% of respondents strongly supported renaming government-owned buildings named after figures whose legacies do not promote the District’s core values of equity, opportunity and prosperity, according to the DCFACES report.
West Elementary enrolled over 317 students during the 2020-2021 academic year, more than half of whom identify as Black. The school is currently named after Joseph Rodman West, a former U.S. senator, Union general and executive in the District. 
Based on the DCFACES report, Bowser sent emergency legislation to Mendelson in July requesting the council to rename the Petworth-area school, given West’s history. 
“DCPS finds that John Lewis, a lifelong champion for justice, is a far superior role model for students in the nation’s capital,” Mayor Bowser wrote in her legislative introduction. “Despite numerous attacks, injuries, and arrests, Lewis remained a devoted advocate of the civil rights movement and nonviolence.” 
West’s legacy carries harm toward minority communities because he ordered the torture and murder of Apache chief Mangas Coloradas, who had arranged a meeting with West to discuss potential terms of peace. West also gave away public land to private railroad companies in an attempt to reduce debt, according to the bill’s Racial Equity Impact Assessment.
Lewis served 17 terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. He passed away July 17, 2020, after battling stage four pancreatic cancer. Lewis helped organize the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and co-led the 1965 Selma to Montgomery March, where he was attacked by state troopers as a peaceful protester on Bloody Sunday. 
Lewis’ passing was a significant loss, but his legacy continues to inspire those who feel called to fight for justice, according to D.C. Ward 2 Councilmember Brooke Pinto.
“The late Rep. John Lewis was a fearless champion for civil rights, fervently dedicated to ensuring that racial justice and equality prevailed in our democracy,” Pinto wrote in an email to The Hoya. “By establishing the John Lewis Elementary School, we not only honor the history of John Lewis, but we inspire D.C.’s next generation to follow in the footsteps of this great American hero and role model.”
The elementary school’s renaming will encourage students and teachers to further educate themselves on the important history of Lewis’s work, according to Mendelson. 
“The name of the school can be inspiring, it can serve as a role model, it can serve as a point reference for teaching,” Mendelson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Perhaps decades from now, students will be interested in who was this person John Lewis, and learn his history and realize he’s someone to be emulated.”
During the first council hearing on the legislation, Ward 4 Councilmember Janeese Lewis George expressed pride in the elementary school’s work to preserve Lewis’s legacy. 
“Growing up, kids often are told to stay out of trouble,” Lewis George said during the hearing. “But at the John Lewis Elementary School, we can probably encourage students to create good trouble, righteous trouble, courageous trouble and trouble in pursuit of justice and in defense of the rights of all people.” 
The names the District chooses to honor matter in determining who students look up to as role models, according to Lewis George. 
“Reckoning with the atrocities of our history can be a messy and uncomfortable process, but is essential for paving a path to a more just and more right future,” Lewis George said.

Festive music, string lights and handmade arts and crafts lined the streets as people shopped and got in the holiday spirit at a Washington, D.C. market.
The Downtown Holiday Market, located in Penn Quarter, reopened Nov. 19 after scaling back events last year as a result of COVID-19 pandemic precautions. Over 70 vendors from the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia (DMV) region welcomed shoppers hoping to purchase holiday gifts, enjoy treats and listen to live entertainment. The Downtown Holiday Market is open daily throughout the holiday season.  
The goal of the Downtown Holiday Market is to connect local businesses with local customers, according to Michael Berman, president of Diverse Markets Management, the firm that runs the Downtown Holiday Market.
“What we try to do is incubate small and local businesses to build them up, get them to a store, get them to a higher professional level from where they’re starting from,” Berman said in an interview with The Hoya. “This activity that we do here is so much exposure and so much interest in shopping that it really gives them a lot of eyes and a lot of sales.”
The Downtown Holiday Market boasts six food vendors, including Migue’s Mini Donuts, The Capital Candy Jar and The Taste of Germany, as well as live music performances from local musicians and bands every day until the market closes for the season Dec. 23. 
Working at the Downtown Holiday Market allows local shops to receive more exposure, according to Karen Locander, who works for Chouquette Chocolates, a Maryland-based chocolate shop that has been at the market for several years.
“We love coming to the market because so many thousands of people get to see our product who wouldn’t normally see it,” Locander said in an interview with The Hoya. “We run out of a small kitchen in Gaithersburg and don’t have a storefront, so this is a great time of year where we reach so many people, and then they can find us online to get chocolates in the future.”
Last holiday season, the Downtown Holiday Market took place on the street to allow for social distancing. The organizers and vendors also implemented COVID-19 safety precautions like masks, hand sanitizer stations and prepackaged food items. 
For this year’s 17th Annual Downtown Holiday Market, two blocks of F Street will once again be closed off to accommodate shoppers and vendors, but other precautions will be lessened, according to Berman.  
“We made a big change last year to move it into the street from the sidewalk and spread it out, and we kept all those changes this year but don’t have the COVID restrictions,” Berman said. “We’re not doing temperature checks; masks are still available but it’s not a requirement, and social distancing is still available but it’s not a requirement.” 
With fewer COVID-19 restrictions, the Downtown Holiday Market now resembles its pre-pandemic features, as organizers were able to expand live music offerings, according to Berman.
“We got to add in our stage,” Berman said. “We got to do some things that we couldn’t do last year, which is nice and feels closer to normal.”
The Downtown Holiday Market is a great way to support small businesses around the holiday season, according to Sarah Nickel, a first-time vendor and the owner of Sarah Nickel Ceramics, which sells hand-thrown and hand-carved pottery.
“Opportunities like this are a really great way to both get out there and also make some sales,” Nickel said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think just coming out and supporting all the vendors here is really great.”
Exploring the Downtown Holiday Market is a festive way to embrace the holiday spirit, according to Berman.
“It’s a lot of fun. There’s some unique shopping, there’s a live stage and there’s food,” Berman said. “It’s a great time, and you’re outside and enjoying the Christmas cheer.”
