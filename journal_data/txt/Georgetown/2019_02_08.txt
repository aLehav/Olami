As Georgetown University Student Association executive candidates seek to make their platforms relevant to students, trust in student government remains low, raising fears of low voter turnout.
Of the respondents, 2 percent rated their current trust in GUSA as strong, while 38.9 percent listed their trust in GUSA as weak, according to a door-to-door poll of 615 students conducted by The Hoya on Wednesday evening. 35 percent of respondents said they were uncertain. 
Outgoing GUSA President Juan Martinez (SFS ’20) also expressed concerns about how many students will go to the polls. 58 percent of respondents said they planned to vote in today’s election, while 42 percent said they are not planning to vote.
“I’m kind of worried for this vote count, just seeing the enthusiasm or the attention given to these elections,” Martinez said at The Hoya’s post-debate analysis Tuesday. “I’m wondering how many people are going to turn out at the polls, how many people are actually going to vote and how is that going to impact the person who gets elected, or how is that going to give more credence to this movement about abolishing GUSA or maybe just fundamentally restructuring GUSA.” 
Overall voter turnout was 39 percent last year and 38 percent in 2017, according to the GUSA Election commission.
In a campaign season dominated by outsider tickets and unprecedented circumstances, candidates are striving to engage students with relevant platforms.
The four tickets vying for the GUSA executive in today’s election are Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Aleida Olvera (COL ’20); Nicki Gray (NHS ’20); Sina Nemazi (COL ’21) and Roya Wolfe (SFS ’21); Ryan Zuccala (MSB ’20) and John Dolan (MSB ’20).
Gray is running for GUSA president without a vice presidential candidate after her former running mate, Sam Appel (COL ’20), removed his name from the executive ballot Feb. 4.
The previous two elected GUSA presidents, Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) and Kamar Mack (COL ’19), had no prior GUSA experience and branded themselves as outsider tickets.
Sexual assault policy was the most important issue in the executive election for approximately 22 percent of poll respondents, with affordability and diversity and inclusivity ranked as the next relevant issues in the race. The student focus on sexual assault policy marks a change from last year’s election, where affordability was the primary concern of respondents.
Three of the four tickets have specific policies addressing sexual assault in their campaign platforms. Zuccala and Dolan’s platform does not reference any sexual assault policy or Title IX changes.
While the three tickets who stressed initiatives on Title IX cited the importance of pressuring the university administration during the ongoing search for a Title IX coordinator, Gray’s platform was the only one that included university collaboration on the issue. All three tickets pushed for student outreach, but Francis-Olvera had the most comprehensive plan to engage with student groups.
Students who ranked sexual assault policy as the most relevant issue in this campaign season expressed preference for Gray, followed closely by Francis and Olvera. 
Francis and Olvera aim to mandate training on sexual assault prevention and bystander intervention for all GUSA executive officials. The pair also plans to build relationships with student advocacy groups to combat sexual assault through the introduction of Title IX training for leaders of campus clubs and organizations, according to Francis. 
“We want to incorporate learning Title IX into bystander training to curb sexual assault or hinder it within club culture,” Francis said at Tuesday’s presidential debate. “There is a lot of ignorance around sexual assault and Title IX on this campus.”
The Nemazi and Wolfe ticket seeks to implement a training program within the Student Advocacy Office, which assists students in navigating the university’s disciplinary policies. The trained student officers would serve as resources to inform survivors on recent Title IX changes as well as the Title IX process. 
If elected, Gray plans to make information on Title IX policy and procedures easily accessible for students through the dissemination of videos. Gray also seeks to push the university administration for more comprehensive interpersonal violence trainings for Georgetown University Police Department officers and faculty members. 
Gray hopes to connect sexual assault advocacy efforts of various administrative centers, including the Academic Resource Center, the LGBTQ Resource Center and the Women’s Center. 
Though voters indicated affordability as the second most relevant issue, it has not been a major theme in the runup to today’s election. All four of the tickets offer policy elements related to reducing student expenses, ranging from decreasing textbook costs to offering stipends for internships to more broadly lowering student tuition. One of Zuccala and Dolan’s three policy areas focuses primarily on reducing tuition prices for students through decreased club expenses.
Voters’ concerns regarding diversity and inclusion dominated the conversation in both executive debates, with candidates calling for greater outreach to student advocacy groups.
During the Jan. 31 vice presidential debate, Olvera stressed how her and Francis’ experiences as members of marginalized communities have shaped their platform and outreach efforts. Wolfe echoed her opponent, emphasizing GUSA’s role as the link between student activists and university administrators.
The candidates also urged greater student input in Tuesday night’s presidential debate. Gray said she hopes to serve as a resource for student activists to achieve their policy goals and streamline the legislative process among GUSA policy teams. Nemazi aims to support the ongoing policy efforts of student advocacy groups who are already pushing initiatives including accessibility of feminine hygiene products. 
With declining trust in the ability of GUSA to address student concerns and four tickets facing a two-week campaign season that came earlier than in past years, the race is expected to be won by a narrow margin. 
Gray leads Francis by a 6.6 point margin for GUSA president, according to The Hoya’s poll.
The poll’s narrow margin suggests no candidate will receive a majority of votes in the first round of voting. If no ticket receives an outright majority in the first round, an instant runoff is conducted between the top performing tickets, per GUSA’s single transferable vote system. In this ranked choice system, the ticket with the lowest vote total is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the remaining candidates based on voters’ indicated second preferences until one ticket receives a majority.
In past years, election results have been tipped by which candidates are ranked second by other candidates’ supporters. Nair’s 36-vote victory margin in the fourth round of voting followed the 2017 election where Mack won in the fourth round by 34 votes after coming in second place in the first round — one of the closest in recent memory.
Students can vote in today’s executive election online using HoyaLink or at polling stations designated by the GUSA Election Commission in the Leavey Center.

Throughout the campaign season for this year’s Georgetown University Student Association executive election, the four tickets have focused not only on their policies, but also the rules and processes of the race.
In today’s election, the ballots will offer voters the opportunity to rank candidates by order of preference. Unlike the United States’ electoral college voting process, the single transferable voting used by GUSA allows for a form of an instantaneous runoff election.
If no ticket initially wins an absolute majority of first-choice votes, the ticket with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated and has its votes redistributed according to the second-choices indicated on those ballots. Through this process, the instant runoff election continues until one ticket has the support of 50 percent of all voters. In general, few tickets earn a majority in the first round and most GUSA elections last until the second or third round.
Voters will rank their choices between the tickets of Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Aleida Olvera (COL ’20); Nicki Gray (NHS ’20); Sina Nemazi (COL ’21) and Roya Wolfe (SFS ’21); and Ryan Zuccala (MSB ’20) and John Dolan (MSB ’20).
The STV election system, intended to ensure wide support for a victorious ticket and improve efficiency, may also have implications for the strategies of tickets and their campaigns. This year’s candidates shared their opinions about how GUSA’s election rules affect campaigning and the possibility of cross-endorsements between tickets in interviews with The Hoya.
In the 2017 executive election, the ticket of Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Jessica Andino (COL ’18) won after a cross-endorsement with the pair of John Matthews (COL ’18) and Nick Matz (COL ’18).
While none of the current candidates expressed an intent to cross-endorse, several noted various grievances with the voting process and GUSA’s election culture, such as the pressure to focus on a laundry list of policy issues.
Reforming Representation
GUSA uses STV rules to strike a balance between an expedient election and ensuring that winning tickets achieve broad support, according to GUSA Election Commission Co-Chair Grant Castle (SFS ’21).
Along with improving efficiency, STV may also stimulate voter engagement, according to professor Roger Lagunoff, an economist specializing in voting processes.
“If anything, STV should encourage participation,”  Lagunoff said. “That was one of its virtues when it was implemented in many jurisdictions — in, for instance, school board election.”
GUSA adopted a ranked-choice voting system in 2006, according to former GUSA historian Ari Goldstein (COL ’18). The reform replaced a plurality-based election system, where the candidate who earns the most votes wins even without a majority. The reform was partly in response to the fact that no ticket received an outright majority of votes for several consecutive years leading up to 2006.
The 2006 GUSA reforms also shifted the representation of the GUSA senate from a system of representatives for each class to representation by residential areas. That reform was overturned in February 2018 after failing to improve voter turnout, according to current GUSA historian Henry Westerman (SFS ’21).
“This move was made in an effort to boost voter turnout, but as you may remember [it] was overturned in a recent referendum after it failed in its stated goals of boosting participation and promoting personal representation for different areas of campus,” Westerman wrote in an email to The Hoya.”
Platform Pressures
The implementation of STV, however, also puts pressure on campaigns to create a platform that can appeal to everyone rather than targeting specific constituents.
“Centralization. That’s the flip side of polarization, isn’t it?” Lagunoff said. “Either you have candidates who are taking extreme positions or you have candidates who are moderating their positions. If you have candidates moderating their positions, they start to look alike.”
With their narrow policy platform focused exclusively on three issues, Zuccala and Dolan see themselves as different from the other executive tickets. Ranked choice voting may disadvantage unorthodox tickets, as voters may reserve their top ranks for platforms that have more in common, according to Zuccala.
“That voter ranking you have to do obviously makes it difficult if you’re so far different from everybody else,” Zuccula said. “You’re not going to be able to get other people’s votes.”
Before his current presidential run, Nemazi worked on the campaign of Josh Sirois (SFS ’20) and Casey Doherty (COL ’20) in the 2018 GUSA executive election. He argued that single transferable vote is an ineffective mechanism because it encourages votes toward unorthodox or “joke” tickets that may affect the outcome, citing the 2018 election as an example.
In that election, Sirois and Doherty carried the most votes in the first round out of all four tickets in the field, including a satirical ticket.  Sirois and Doherty lost in the third round to Sahil Nair (SFS ’19)  and Naba Rahman (SFS ’19) after the bottom two tickets were eliminated and their votes redistributed by rankings.
“People voted for Batman as a joke, and then those votes went to Sahil and Naba,” Nemazi said. “It’s tricky, because if these people were voting for the purpose of making campaign better and improving it, then Josh and Casey seemed to have the support.”
Gray, running as a solo presidential candidate, indicated that other factors, including a general lack of understanding about GUSA’s role, have forced candidates to take a stance on all campus issues, regardless of their relevance.
“I think that, far more than rules, precedent and a lack of understanding on the part of the student body (through no fault of their own) has forced executive campaigns to form and state opinions on almost every single campus issue,” Gray wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Nemazi agreed with the idea that campaigns were pressured to focus on a similar, broad range of issues.
Regardless of the campaigns’ similar policies, however, there is still room for candidates to separate themselves from the pack, according to Francis.
“I would say that folks could definitely distinguish themselves based off of the thoroughness of their research and reaching out to groups themselves and how they would enact those policies,” Francis said.
In their run for the GUSA executive, Francis and Olvera believe their proposed policies reflect their convictions.
“I don’t believe that we have moved too far to the middle ground from where a lot of our beliefs and policies lie,” Olvera said. “We’ve made sure to stay straight with what we believe in and not try to compromise too many of our beliefs.”
Considering Cross-Endorsements
In recent years, GUSA elections have been decided on tight margins. Last year’s presidential election saw voter turnout of 39 percent, marking the win of Nair and Rahman by a margin of 36 votes. The 2017 presidential election led Mack and Andino to win with an even tighter margin of just 34 votes.
In the past, candidates have attempted “cross-endorsing” each other, or giving recommended second choices for the ranked ballot. This year, however, no candidates have declared their intentions to cross-endorse.
While not signaling an intention to give a cross-endorsement, Nemazi emphasized dialogue between the campaigns as of Feb. 1.
“At this stage, no, we don’t have any endorsements of other campaigns,” Nemazi said. “But, I will say that I’ve spoken with a lot of the other candidates to just talk about policy. At the end of the day we’re all running to try and make campus better.”
Francis and Olvera also expressed the importance of communication and cooperation across campaigns, though both felt unprepared to cross-endorse any of their competitors as of Feb. 2.
Zuccula said other tickets would need to convince him and Dolan of the similarity of their platforms to earn a cross-endorsement.
“If someone came to us and made a valid argument as to why we should tell our voters to vote for them second, and maybe they incorporate part of our platform into their platform and make promises about how they will make sure things get done, maybe.” Zuccula said.
“But we haven’t had that kind of conversation yet and we’re not ready to make that kind of decision.”
Gray did not indicate whether she would cross-endorse another ticket and instead highlighted the experience she has gained by interacting with other tickets throughout the campaign.
“The time that I have spent in campaign-mode thus far has been so rewarding as has allowed me to meet and learn about various issues from so many people with whom I’d have been unlikely to come into contact or get-to-know otherwise,” Gray wrote.
Correction: This article previously stated that GUSA historian Henry Westerman is in the SFS class of 2022; Westerman is in the class of 2021.

A campaign aimed to educate and spread awareness about microaggressions in the medical field launched at the Georgetown University School of Medicine this week.
The campaign will include 17 educational posters on microaggressions: brief, often-used phrases that are degrading either intentionally or unintentionally. The posters will be placed around the medical school and define microaggressions as well as propose a plan to deal with such interactions.
The campaign posters will encourage a “Take A.C.T.I.O.N” approach in response to encounters with microaggressions, inspired by an approach based on research on microaggression and diversity in college classroom.
The plan’s title refers to asking, carefully listening, telling others, considering the impact of one’s comment, owning your response, and looking to take subsequent steps when responding to a microaggressor.
Combating microaggressions helps debunk stereotypes that obscure the diversity that exists within the field of medicine, according to Director of Faculty Development at the University of Nebraska Medical Center Linda Love, who has publicly endorsed the program.  
“When our patients don’t recognize our women experts as ‘the doctor,’ it takes a reassuring voice, or two, to help educate patients about their valuable health care team,” Love wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Every day, we are called to elevate the conversation. Preparation and alertness are key.”
The initiative is developed by the School of Medicine’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion but was inspired by the medical school’s student-based Council on Diversity Affairs, according to Senior Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion Susan Cheng.
“They wanted to both educate and engage our medical school community in dialogue around what microaggressions are, how these commonplace statements, jokes, or actions can occur at anytime and anywhere, and how best to respond to them,” Cheng wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The campaign comes as the medical school is preparing to launch its Bias Reduction Improvement coaching program. The program aims to educate faculty and staff who would be responsible for holding sensitivity awareness sessions in the medical school. The medical school is in the process of identifying coaches for the program and plans to have the program operational later this year.
Spreading awareness about how to handle microaggressions in the medical field and workplace is an important part of educating students beyond their traditional clinical training, Cheng wrote.
“We train students to be doctors, and that goes beyond anatomy and physiology,” Cheng wrote. “We want our future physicians to have the tools they need on campus and in the workplace to deal with challenging situations whether that be in the various hospitals/clinic settings over the course of their training, or later when they become care managers and physician leaders.”
The microaggressions campaign drew attention in January after several right-wing publications criticized the program as unnecessary, and rejected the concept of microaggressions. Georgetown’s microaggression campaign is meant to help students navigate situations where they feel uncomfortable so they can to handle these interactions in real life, Cheng wrote to The Hoya in response to these criticisms. 
“Our goal is to give all our medical students a range of tools to choose from that they’ll need to address situations that they find uncomfortable or inappropriate,” Cheng said. “We want our students to be prepared with communication tools to effectively interact with and navigate these distressing situations and to practice responding in real time.”
Learning how to effectively communicate and interact with people of different backgrounds is a crucial skill for medical students to learn, Council on Diversity Affairs member Hamsini Rao (MED ’21) wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“In a rapidly changing world with our communities (and patients) flourishing with diversity, we as providers should learn to communicate effectively, and understand the impact and barriers microaggressions pose to that communication,” Rao wrote. “It’s important that medical students get involved in this process because we are the next generation of leaders.”
As the campaign develops, discussions regarding microaggressions will be incorporated into existing dialogue surrounding diversity in the medicine program, Cheng wrote.
“In the future, the Microaggressions in Medicine Campaign will be integrated into our diversity dialogues in medicine program where our medical students engage each other in conversations around issues of inclusion and diversity,” Cheng wrote.

Good Evening,
Some fellow residents and I were interested in using your slogan to help address micro aggressions in our hospital at CHKD. I was curious about how the program has been working at your institution and if you had any advise to offer us. 
Thanks,
Lindsey Crawford

President Donald Trump called for unity across party divides while remaining firm on hardline stances on immigration in his second State of the Union speech before a joint session of the U.S. Congress on Feb. 5.
Members of Congress can move the country forward if they mend division along party lines and agree to cooperate on issues like immigration and border security, Trump said.
“Together, we can break decades of political stalemate,” Trump said. “We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future. The decision is ours to make.”
The State of the Union followed the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which lasted for 35 days. The speech itself was originally scheduled for Jan. 29 but was delayed for a week after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) retracted Trump’s first invitation to speak on the House floor until the government reopened.
Despite the bipartisan sentiment present in his address, Trump portrayed Democrats who opposed funding for a border wall and supported further investigation into his administration as uncooperative and out of touch.
“No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration,” Trump said. “Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.”
The partial government shutdown began after Trump refused to sign legislation passed by Congress to fund the government unless it provided for construction of a wall on the border with Mexico. 
On Jan. 25, Trump signed legislation that reopened the government until Feb. 15. If Congress does not pass a spending bill that receives Trump’s signature by that time, the government will shut down again.
Trump and Democratic lawmakers found agreement on the increased representation of women in Congress. In his address, Trump celebrated the record number of women currently serving in Congress than ever before — a line that received celebration from female lawmakers, many of whom wore white suits to honor suffragettes. 
An historic 117 women were elected to serve in the 116th Congress during the 2018 midterms. A total of 127 women now hold seats on Capitol Hill, 106 of whom are Democrats.
Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) attended as a guest of Pelosi. In a news release before the speech, Bowser urged Congress to pass legislation preventing gun violence. The federal government needs to address gun violence because state laws are not effective in solving the issue, according to Bowser.
“In places like Washington, D.C., where we have some of the strongest gun laws in the nation, we know better than anyone that this is a matter that won’t be solved state by state,” Bowser said. “Firearms can travel across state lines and so can those who use them.”
The official Democratic response to the State of the Union came from Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic candidate in Georgia’s race for governor. Bipartisanship is key to overcoming current divisions caused by President Trump, Abrams said. 
“The shutdown was a stunt engineered by the president of the United States, one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people but our values,” Abrams said. “In this time of division and crisis, we must come together and stand for, and with, one another.”
On campus, GU Politics hosted a State of the Union watch party in collaboration with the College Republicans and College Democrats. 
Trump’s speech touched on bipartisan concerns, such as the fight against HIV/AIDS and lowering health care costs; however, the Trump administration’s actions have not lined up with his rhetoric, AJ Williamson (COL ’21), Director of Campaigning and Off-Campus Affairs for GU College Democrats.
“His comments on healthcare are bizarre given his administration and party’s repeated attempts to undermine the Affordable Care Act and take insurance from millions of Americans,” Williamson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The State of the Union watch party helped promote conversations across the aisle, according to Jake Lyons (COL ’21), a former president of GU College Republicans who helped organize the event. 
“It’s important for Hoyas to be able to interact and talk to people who think differently than them,” Lyons wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Having joint events with GUCR, GUCD and GU Politics breaks down those barriers and provides a forum to have those conversations.”

Congressional Republicans are likely to cooperate with Democrats even without obtaining provisions for President Donald Trump’s border wall to avoid another government shutdown, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) (SFS ’66, LAW ’69) said at an event Monday. 
The sole path towards preventing another shutdown is Senate Republicans defecting from Trump’s position on border wall funding, according to Durbin. 
“The only way to avoid another shutdown is if Republican senators will join Democratic senators and say, ‘We’re just not going through with this again,’” Durbin said. “I think we’re close to that. I think there are enough Republicans that are just fed up with it.” 
The event was hosted by the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service and moderated by the institute’s executive director, former spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee Mo Elleithee.
After a 35-day shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, Trump signed a spending bill Jan. 25 to reopen the government for three weeks. The shutdown began after House Democrats and Trump sparred over funding for his proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. 
The spending bill will fund the government until Feb. 15. However, the bill did not include the border wall funding that Trump initially demanded from Congressional Democrats.
Durbin also said Republicans are likely to renege on their loyalty to Trump and stop supporting  the border wall to prevent another shutdown Feb. 15.
“It will be hard as heck for the President to keep his ranks solid among Senate Republicans if he tries to go for another shutdown,” Durbin said. “I’ve got my fingers crossed that that will avoid the possibility.”
Trump is blocking the two parties from reaching a comprehensive immigration agreement, according to Durbin. In 2017, Trump ordered an end to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected young immigrants without documentation who entered the United States as children from deportation. 
“There is room for compromise on border security and on immigration, once we believe people are coming at this with goodwill,” Durbin said. “Currently, some of the statements made by President Trump in the campaign make people in the immigration community wary of whether he’ll ever reach an agreement and I’m one of them.”
The Trump administration also pushed to end a humanitarian program in 2018 that was enacted in 2001 following the devastating earthquakes in El Salvador that allowed Salvadorans to live and work legally in the United States.
Democrats need to confront their party’s weakness in the Midwest in the upcoming 2020 Presidential election by improving their economic message, Durbin said. 
The party connect to Midwestern voters by focusing on health care and highlighting provisions from the Affordable Care Act that protect individuals with pre-existing medical conditions from discrimination, according to Durbin.
“We discovered that those words were killer words when it came to the Republican position on the Affordable Care Act, because there is hardly a person alive that doesn’t know someone with a pre-existing condition, and they are usually in their family and the notion that they would be tossed into a marketplace, an unforgiving marketplace, was unacceptable,” Durbin said. “It was more than just an economic issue, it was an issue of justice and fairness.”
Enacted in 2010, The Affordable Care Act, also commonly known as Obamacare, made health insurance available to more people by providing consumers with subsidies and expanding the Medicaid program to cover all adults with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level.
Democrats marketed the Affordable Care Act with the promise that insured Americans could keep their present healthcare plan. That promise diminished the credibility among Democrats, according to Durbin. 
“You’ve got to make sure that in the process people feel that they are not being hurt, they are not being forced into decisions about their medical care that they don’t want to make and don’t want to get caught up in,” Durbin said.
Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies cannot keep selling plans that do not cover prescription drugs and maternity care. This restriction resulted in hundreds of thousands of subscribers who previously chose to purchase plans without prescription drugs and maternity care receiving notices saying that their insurance plans were no longer available, according to The Washington Post. 
After the 2018 midterm elections, the Democrats picked up 40 seats in the House of Representatives. The diversity of these new representatives will reinvigorate the Democratic Party, according to Durbin. 
“What I like about the cast of new characters among the Democratic Caucus in the house is the diversity and variety,” Durbin said. “Diversity, to me, sends a message out that this Democratic Party is open for business. No matter what you look like, what your background is, what your personal or religious beliefs might be, we are open to sit down and talk and make you part of who we are.”

Individuals experiencing homelessness in Washington, D.C., faced increased risk of hypothermia from freezing temperatures and extreme wind chill brought by last week’s polar vortex.
The Arctic cold front plunged 72 percent of the continental U.S. population into record-breaking freezing temperatures, according to CNN. In D.C., temperatures dropped to a low of 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit on Jan. 29 and a low of 12.02 F on Jan. 30.
Polar vortexes — wide expanses of cold air swirling around the North Pole — usually remain stable, resting 60,000 feet high in the atmosphere. However, when the vortex is disrupted, it can bring large amounts of Arctic air to the Northern Hemisphere, according to The Washington Post.
These freezing conditions are of particular concern for those experiencing homelessness in the District due to prolonged exposure to the cold. The recent polar vortex put them at an increased risk for experiencing hypothermia.
Homeless shelters in the District have taken extra measures to accommodate these especially low temperatures, according to a spokesperson for the D.C. Office of the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services.
“We have more capacity for hypothermia nights and extreme cold nights, which is the highest level of concern,” the spokesperson said in an interview with The Hoya. “We plan for increased numbers during times like the polar vortex to accommodate those that don’t normally seek out shelter in other conditions.”
As of Feb. 1, 1,765 beds were occupied in D.C. shelters by individuals seeking safety from the conditions outside, according to the Office of the Deputy Mayor spokesperson. Last winter, the city estimated its homeless population to be at approximately 7,000 people.
The District government activated a cold weather emergency alert Jan. 31 due to the temperature and wind chill drop. When the alert is activated, all low-barrier shelters — shelters that house individuals without requirements such as sobriety or a drug test — remain open 24 hours a day for the duration of the extreme weather conditions.
The Washington, D.C. Congregation of the Church of Christ, which provides shelter for up to 30 women on a nightly basis, experienced an influx of individuals seeking shelter during the recent polar vortex, according to church spokesperson Kevin Bryant.
“The operation of the shelter continued through the polar vortex to provide maximum support during those most brutal days,” Bryant wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Attendance at the shelter did increase beyond the norm on those days.”
Bryant said that he had spoken with individuals who feared for their safety and knew others who had died during the polar vortex.
The Department of Health and Human Services has a call center that works to increase accessibility to shelters by providing rides to individuals who either contact the center themselves or are identified by a member of the public as needing assistance.
Using this resource, the public can play a role in aiding those experiencing homelessness, according to a spokesperson from the Office of the Deputy Mayor.
“We call on members of the public to be our partner to call a shelter hotline when the see someone who needs help outside,” the spokesperson said in an interview for The Hoya. 
Georgetown students can volunteer for the Homelessness Outreach, Meals and Education program through the Center for Social Justice. The program promotes advocacy campaigns and service opportunities, according to the program website.
The program includes a Hypothermia Outreach Team that focuses on aiding those experiencing homelessness during the winter months, according to the HOME program coordinator.
HOT teams walk in and around Georgetown on cold nights when individuals staying outside might be in danger of hypothermia and frostbite. The students call the shelter hotline to request a transportation service for anyone who wants to go to a shelter, provide warming supplies to those who wish to stay outside and call emergency services for those experiencing illness or hypothermia.

Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) introduced a bill to establish a local prosecutor for Washington, D.C. on Jan. 31 as part of a larger push for autonomy in the District.
Currently, federal prosecutors from the Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia handle criminal cases in the District. These prosecutors are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate with no input from D.C. residents. D.C. is the only current U.S. territory without a local prosecutor.
The U.S. Attorney should be focusing on prosecuting federal crimes instead of pursuing local matters, Norton said. 
“A U.S. Attorney has no business prosecuting the local crimes of a jurisdiction, an out-of-date status quo that harkens to pre-home-rule D.C.,” Norton said in a Jan. 31 news release. “My bill simply gives D.C. the same authority that the states and U.S. territories enjoy as an essential element of self-government.”
In every other U.S. city, prosecutors of serious local crimes are either elected or appointed by local officials. Local crimes comprise the majority of U.S. Attorneys’ cases in D.C., according to a press release from Norton’s office.
The Office of the Attorney General has the capacity to prosecute additional adult offenses, and a local prosecutor would afford D.C. a welcome amount of autonomy, D.C.’s current Attorney General Karl A. Racine said. 
“Congresswoman Norton’s proposal would give the District’s more than 700,000 residents a further measure of self-governance that we currently lack and deserve,” Racine wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The bill would implement the will of District voters in a 2002 referendum to create a local prosecutor’s office.”
In 2002 D.C. residents passed a referendum advising that the Home Rule Act should be amended to establish an Office of the District Attorney for the District of Columbia, headed by a locally elected, independent district attorney. No bill has been passed regarding a district attorney in the District since this referendum.
Norton’s bill is the latest in her “Free and Equal D.C.” series of legislation, which aims to give D.C. citizens more equality and autonomy while pursuing statehood. 
As part of “Free and Equal D.C.,” Norton also introduced a bill allowing the Washington, D.C. Council to pass laws without waiting for review from Congress on Jan. 24. The bill would eliminate the congressional review periods of 30 and 60 days from civil and criminal legislation, respectively, during which Congress can pass a resolution effectively vetoing the law in question.
The 1973 D.C. Home Rule Act, which established the D.C. Council, was the last major expansion of district autonomy from the federal government.
Norton introduced H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, which would make the district the 51st state in the union, Jan. 3. The bill earned a record 155 original cosponsors, a number which has now grown to 194. 
“We are gratified by the overwhelming support from my Democratic colleagues as we seize this new moment for statehood and press our bill in the 116th Congress with unprecedented momentum,” Norton told the Washington Examiner Jan 3.

The D.C. Circulator system of public buses is free of charge for all riders between Jan. 28 and Feb. 28 as part of Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) “#FairShotFebruary” initiative.
The Circulator is a six-line system of buses that connect major tourist, business and cultural attractions in D.C. and Rosslyn, Va. Ordinarily, trips cost a flat $1 fare. Making the Circulator free is a way to increase economic opportunity for D.C. residents, according to Bowser.
“We’re kicking off Fair Shot February by making it easier for Washingtonians to get where they need to go and connect to opportunities across DC,” Bowser wrote in a Jan. 25 news release. “A free Circulator is one way we can use our resources to break down barriers to opportunity.”  
Fair Shot February is a campaign launched by the mayor’s office to improve access to city services for working class D.C. residents. Fair Shot February comes on the heels of Mayor Bowser’s October investments in infrastructure and affordable housing among other public services as part of her Fair Shot budget, which she introduced in March 2018.
Georgetown students can access the Circulator via the Blue line, with stops located along M Street, and the Yellow line, with stops along Wisconsin Avenue. 
Though the initiative will ease transportation costs for riders, the campaign could have been better publicized, Grace Ring (COL ’21) wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“I love the Circulator because it is cheap, easy and fast but there was not a lot of advertising so I did not pick up that it was free for the whole month,” Ring wrote.
With no Metro stops, Georgetown has a limited selection of public transportation options for its residents. The Circulator, as well as the city bus, provides Georgetown residents access into Washington, D.C. When the District officially began plans for the Metro in the early 1960s, a proposed Georgetown stop was left on the drawing board due to opposition from residents as well as concerns with the feasibility of construction.
The free ride program roughly coincides with similar efforts from Maryland’s MARC commuter rail and Montgomery County’s Ride On shuttle system, both of which became free to ride for government workers during the 35-day government shutdown last December and January, according to The Washington Post. 
The cost of the program has not yet been determined by the Mayor’s office, and funding sources remain unclear. These details are likely to be clarified when the city finalizes its new budget later this year, according to the news release.
The campaign also includes a series of budget engagement forums. These forums will give Washingtonians an opportunity to voice their opinions about D.C.’s municipal budget before it is finalized, according to the news release.
In addition to the Circulator free ride program and budget engagement forums, Mayor Bowser has also held town halls under the Fair Shot February branding to discuss various city services and programs.
As part of Fair Shot February, the city has also announced a $100,000 grant to assist District residents seeking to apply for citizenship. In partnership with the National Immigration Forum, the program will provide up to $725 to workers in both the government and private sector who are seeking U.S. citizenship.
The money would help offset the costs from application fees, English classes and legal counsel, which can often be a cost burden for prospective immigrants, according to a Feb. 4 news release. 
The fund enables immigrants to pursue citizenship while providing advantages for the city as well, according to Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum.
“This fund will help new Americans reach their full potential as U.S. citizens, and all District residents will benefit because of its positive effects on the community and economy,” Noorani said in the news release. “We are proud to partner with Mayor Bowser on this initiative that’s a win-win for Washington, D.C., businesses and employees alike.”
