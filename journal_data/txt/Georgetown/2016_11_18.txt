Following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in last Tuesday’s election, white Americans should be conscious of their role in improving race relations and standing in solidarity with racial and religious minorities, argued social justice activist and writer Shaun King at a discussion Tuesday.
“We could go two routes here in 2017. We could keep doing what we’ve always been doing, which I think has been proven not to work that well, which is to stay isolated, or we could find fresh new ways to unify that I don’t even know if it’s been done before. I think that if we get into a cocoon, it can be real problematic in the days ahead,” King said.
King, who is best known for his role in the Black Lives Matter movement, joined sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson and moderator James Peterson, an English professor at Lehigh University, in discussing ways to promote activism on college campuses. The three offered student leaders advice on how to organize resistance movements in light of Trump’s victory, which was held in the Intercultural Center.
“Young people are frustrated,” King said. “They’re not just frustrated with the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency but they feel like the system itself failed them. Like the nation failed them. The country failed them. Like the Democratic Party failed them.”
King’s visit came amid a spike in hate crimes since last week’s election. The Southern Poverty Law Center has recorded over 200 incidents since Nov. 11, while three bias-related incidents on and off campus have been announced by the Georgetown University Police Department since Nov. 1.
King’s social media presence has gained attention in recent weeks as he has called for citizens across the nation to organize and protest the election results until Trump’s inauguration Jan. 20 .
Dyson said recent racial tensions show the need for unity and solidarity.
“What we are dealing with now may be the most heinous manifestation in a generation, but it is not new; it is recycling old evil and prejudice and bias, and what you and I must do is foster our togetherness and be determined not to be defeated by this,” Dyson said.
Dyson said it is important to not single out individuals, but to address white culture when discussing race relations.
“I’m not talking about individual brothers and sisters,” Dyson said. “I’m talking about collective whiteness. Whiteness as an ideology and politics.”
Dyson urged white Americans who are disheartened by the results of the election to actively show support for minorities. Certain activists have been wearing safety pins to show that they stand in solidarity with minority populations.
“Empathize with those people who are the victims of [the election]. They don’t have a choice of wearing a safety pin to identify themselves because our skin is our safety pin. Our hijab is our safety pin. Our dress is our safety pin except it becomes a stigma to mark us,” Dyson said.
During the question-and-answer session following the conversation, Gallaudet University American Sign Language professor Felicia Williams, who is deaf, questioned the role of Black Lives Matter in handling protesters who are disabled. Williams said she and other members of the disabled community often get rejected from protests.
King agreed the Black Lives Matter movement needs to be more inclusive.
“It’s so easy for me and all of us to be thoughtless about people who are different than us. And you have reminded me, and all of us, of how thoughtless and careless we can be sometimes. I want to thank you for having the courage to call it out. Anything I organize, I will now be more thoughtful of that being a need,” King said.
King also met with members of co-sponsoring student groups before the panel to discuss how college students can organize to protest social injustice and handle societal pushback for protesting.
“It’s very easy in position of privilege and protection to say ‘wait and see.’ Panic is appropriate. The fear and concern is appropriate. Anybody is saying we are overreacting is wrong. We should have overreacted months ago,” King said at the meeting.
The talk was co-sponsored by the Georgetown University Black Student Alliance, the Center for Social Justice, the university’s chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Casa Latina, the Black House, Georgetown University Women of Color and the Georgetown University Student Association Fund.
Lecture Fund President D.J. Angelini (MSB ’17) said King’s discussion topic set the conversation apart from previous events.
“What was special about this event was that inherent to the conversation was a call to action,” Angelini said. “We heard thoughts from these individuals on current events and racial justice in America, but there was an undercurrent of action that made this event stand out.”
Dylan Burke (SFS ’20), who attended the discussion, said he felt a sense of guilt listening to the discussion due to the actions of other white Americans. Burke said he understood the importance of listening to both King and Dyson because it provided a route to rectify the mistakes of the past.
“I was encouraged when listening to Shaun talk about the importance of young people of all races in shaping a better future for our planet, as I knew there was a place for me in fighting to right the wrongs of both the present and the past,” Burke said.
Lecture Fund member Kumail Aslam (COL ’19) said Dyson and King’s analysis of race relations and xenophobia was a necessary given current events.
“This is something that we hope, and I hope, the Lecture Fund will really advocate for, which is bringing speakers that can help communities of color,” Aslam said. “Shaun and Dyson both talked about bringing together these communities. That’s something we want to deal with in the upcoming months.”

Just so I’m clear….is “The Hoya” supporting this racist babble or just reporting it. Seems like the news should be the racist spewing: “I’m talking about collective whiteness. Whiteness as an ideology and politics.” Coming from a Georgetown University professor is despicable.
[…] listening to activist Shaun King and Georgetown sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson speak to an auditorium full of social justice advocates just days after the 2016 presidential election, a question rang out from the audience that […]

Over 80 percent of the Washington, D.C. electorate voted in favor of D.C. statehood Nov. 8, advancing a measure to petition Congress to induct the District of Columbia as the 51st state.
The four-part referendum, which was proposed by Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) in April and unanimously approved by the D.C. Council in July, includes measures to admit the District into the union under the name New Columbia and call for an elected representative form of government. Additionally, the voters approved a Constitution and state boundaries for the District.
Under the proposal, the state of New Columbia would be converted into a residential state with small cutouts for government buildings and monuments remaining federal district land. The measure would further replace the D.C. mayor with a governor and the D.C. Council with a 21-member legislative assembly.
At the federal level, the new state would have one voting representative in the House of Representatives and two senators. The District of Columbia currently has one nonvoting representative in the House of Representatives, Eleanor Holmes Norton (D). Holmes Norton is currently only allowed to serve on committees and talk on the House floor.
D.C. also currently has two nonvoting shadow senators and one nonvoting shadow representative in Congress. These elected delegates’ main roles are to lobby Congress to give District residents full representation.
Bowser said she hopes to deliver a petition to President-elect Donald Trump and Congressional leaders before Trump’s inauguration in January. Congress has the power to approve or reject the measure.
One of D.C.’s shadow senators, Paul Strauss (D), who was elected by D.C. residents for a two-year term but has no vote in Congress due to D.C.’s lack of statehood, said he was heartened by the positive consensus of District residents. However, Strauss said the statehood movement faces an uphill battle with the Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress as D.C. is predominantly Democratic, with the D.C. Board of Elections reporting 76 percent of the District’s voters are registered Democrats as of Oct. 31.
“We intend to continue to educate the American people about D.C.’s need and desire for statehood and we’re pleased to have the new tools given to us by the referendum,” Strauss said. “But in the 115th Congress, let’s be frank, we are back on defense and so most of our time will be spent defending the limited existent sovereignty that we have, as opposed to moving the ball forward.”
D.C.’s shadow Representative, Franklin Garcia (D), attributed the potential Republican reluctance to the measure to the prospect of two new Democratic senators and a Democratic member of the House.
“People’s rights should not be a partisan issue, but unfortunately it is,” Garcia said. “The fact that both houses are now under Republican control makes it very, very challenging.”
Congress previously defeated an attempt for D.C. statehood in 1993 after a House vote rejected a proposal 277-153 votes. Earlier attempts, including a 1980 call for a constitutional convention and a 1982 ratification of a constitution by D.C. voters, either stalled or expired.
Garcia said the drive for statehood has been an issue of disenfranchisement in D.C. and needs to be addressed.
“The referendum is a piece of work that goes back to ’81 at a minimum,” Garcia said. “Prior to that, people were already talking about autonomy. People have been complaining for centuries, if you will.”
Chris Murphy, Georgetown’s vice president for government relations and community engagement, acknowledged the value of the referendum as an opportunity for reflection on options for advocates of D.C. statehood. He also said it highlighted the need for Georgetown students to become active in the movement.
“It’s a moment for D.C. statehood advocates to step back, regroup and explore the options for going forward,” Murphy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “For starters, they need to find ways to educate people about this ongoing injustice that denies 670,000 Americans a basic right of democracy every day. And Georgetown students — many of whom come from all around the country and the world — can be an important part of this effort.”
Georgetown University Student Association Federal and D.C. Relations Committee Secretary of D.C. Statehood Cheryl Liu (SFS ’19), who is also a member of GU Students for D.C. Statehood, a student organization that helped campaign for the referendum, cited a lack of nationwide concern for the statehood effort as major problem facing the issue. If constituents from other states called on their representatives in Congress to vote for the matter, Liu said she believes it would gain more traction, even among Republicans.
“I think it’s not as universal an issue as it should be in that if you don’t live in D.C., you aren’t affected by it,” Liu said. “They’re not pushing their congressmen or senators to move on this issue. If our representatives don’t feel pressure, then they’re probably not going to have this at the top of their priority list.”

Georgetown facilities workers rejected the university’s proposal to increase annual wages by 2 percent Wednesday, opening up the possibility of a general strike.
In a two-part vote conducted Monday at the main campus and Wednesday at the Georgetown University Law Center, workers voted in a 2-1 ratio against the tentative agreement reached between union representatives and university administrators Oct. 26, which falls short of the 1199 Service Employees International Union’s original demand of a 6 percent wage increase.
The proposed contract was the same one the university offered workers when negotiations began in June. The current contract expired Oct. 30 after it was extended from its initial June 30 renewal deadline.
Georgetown Solidarity Committee member Esmeralda Huerta (SFS ’17) said the workers’ next steps are uncertain. Workers will present the results of their vote to union representatives, and the university may then decide whether to continue negotiations with the union.
Should university administrators choose not to renegotiate conditions, the workers may vote to hold a strike to protest against the proposal.
“The university has the power to decide whether to continue negotiating. Depending on whether or not they want to keep negotiating, if they do want to negotiate, the union and the workers will keep bargaining,” Huerta said. “If they don’t, to my understanding, the workers must then take a strike vote to say whether or not they want to go on strike.”
Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said the university is awaiting the union’s next steps.
“We are disappointed that the vote to ratify the agreement was unsuccessful,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We understand that the union is planning to discuss the outcome and next steps with the membership as soon as possible.”
A worker who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation said the union representatives had been vague in their recommendations to workers on whether to accept the contract.
Cleaning firm contractor P&R Enterprises and cleaning workers reached a contract agreement in June to increase wages in an example of a successful union negotiation process, according to the worker. The Georgetown Solidarity Committee has organized protests against the university’s contract proposal.
“We’re really uncertain on that, because when we did have the meeting, the union informed us that they weren’t going to come back to the table or anything like that,” the worker said. “We had to inform them that during the P&R negotiations, that the students had protested and assisted the union in getting a fair contract where now they make more than we do — the contractors.”
Workers, labor union representatives and student activists demanded a wage increase tied to the cost of living in Washington, D.C., similar parking and health care benefits to what workers at the Georgetown University MedStar Hospital receive and fair supervision practices.
Facilities workers currently pay $140 per month for parking and $15 for health care visits.
In addition to a 2 percent annual wage increase, the proposal the workers rejected denoted a $0.25 increase in wages every year until June 2019. The proposal required all minimum wages to increase to $13.50 per hour by June 2017 and $14.25 per hour by June 2019, in line with Washington, D.C. minimum wage increases.
Workers interviewed by The Hoya said they were disappointed with the final proposal and the union’s bargaining capabilities.
Another facilities worker, who also asked to remain anonymous, said the union representatives’ work was not enough.
“Many of us believe that the union is not doing as much as it could be doing,” the worker said.
A second facilities worker, who asked to remain anonymous, said the union was unwilling to consider renegotiating terms with the university.
“They informed us that management said that this was their final offer, and so, the union was telling us that this was their final offer, and so they were trying to encourage us to vote yes,” the worker said. “They admitted that we were underpaid. And so, we were questioning them on why they would bring us an underpaid contract. It doesn’t make sense the way they presented the contract to us.”
Huerta said the union’s work has been ineffective.
“The union could definitely be doing a better job, to be honest. Its head organizer was dismissed halfway through the contract negotiations, earlier last month. I feel like the union could have been pushing for more,” Huerta said. “For the past six months, Georgetown has refused to budge, and honestly it’s the union that’s been giving up on its demands.”
The facilities worker said he is aware of the possibility for workers to go on strike.
“We have to keep all options open,” the worker said.
Huerta said regardless, university administrators should be held accountable for failing to provide fair working conditions to facilities workers.
“At the end of the day, I see the onus falling on Georgetown to grant the workers who work at this university fair working conditions and just pay,” Huerta said.

In addition to four other Georgetown alumni newly elected to the U.S. House of Representatives on Nov. 8, Republicans John Faso of New York (LAW ’79) and Francis Rooney of Florida (CAS ’75, LAW ’78) will join a total of 22 Hoyas serving in the 115th Congress. In an interview with The Hoya this week, Faso and Rooney reflected on their time on the campaign trail, their goals and their expectations under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump.
How will the Trump presidency affect what you do in Congress?
Faso: The American people obviously voted for change, and this is going to be an administration that is very change – oriented. A lot of the conventional wisdom, prevailing knowledge as to how government should operate, will be challenged. It may not be changed ultimately, but certainly the conventional wisdom is going to be challenged on a whole series of fronts.
Rooney: The people spoke clearly, defied the pundits and elected Donald Trump president, which gives us an opportunity to execute on the conservative government things — an effort to roll back the clock on eight years of anti-private industry and freedom-restricting liberal government policy.
How has your experience at Georgetown shaped the way you approach your job?
Faso: Well, I went to Georgetown Law School for four years, five nights a week, and one of the greatest things that I got out of the Georgetown experience was just building a network of contacts that I still, in some respects, rely on today. So it was a great network. Obviously, it was a very fine legal education, and I’ve used that every day since that time when I graduated, which was quite some time ago.
Rooney: Georgetown’s Jesuit education has been an incredible value to me and my family that me and my wife Cathleen have raised, my approach toward business, charity, civic engagement. The Jesuits teach us, first and foremost, to think and to see God everywhere. Those are two really important principles to deploy to try to reach a successful point in life.
What challenges have you encountered throughout your career?
Faso: The challenges are many. Trying to run statewide in New York State, which is of course very difficult for a Republican — that’s certainly challenging. But I think that the challenge stays trying to get people to understand the role of government. I’m a believer in a limited government. We have gone way too far in terms of centralizing power and authority in Washington.
Rooney: Most of my career has been in business. I’m first and foremost a businessperson. To build a company from a very small one to a reasonably sized one, you have to take a lot of risks, you have occasional setbacks. The key to building a good company is to have a focus on building a good culture, being honest and forthright with your employees and customers and work for the long haul and make investments for the long haul.
What are your goals for your upcoming term in Congress?
Faso: My goal is to work productively in the House to help spur economic growth in the country by tax and regulatory change.
Rooney: I’m a very conservative Republican. I have longstanding support from my party of raising money and advocating for conservative issues. So I’ll have the opportunity to advance some of those issues, pushing for limited government, getting our spending under control, getting back some of the job-controlling regulations that the Obama administration put into place and hopefully reforming the tax codes to be more stimulative of growth, so that we can return to the kind of 3.5 to 4 percent growth that our country had for many years.
In addition, a more macro priority is in southern Florida, we live by the Everglades, and we have Lake Okeechobee. The watershed that flows into the Gulf of Mexico through the Caloosahatchee River — 16 years ago, the federal government committed to pay half the cost to clean up the lake and the watershed, and to restore the Everglades. So far, Florida has put in a lot of money, but the federal government has not put in that much. One of my priorities locally is to work hard with other members of the local delegation to get some more of the money appropriated to execute on the Everglades Restoration Plan, which was passed in the year 2000.

Two Georgetown students were attacked in separate bias-related incidents off campus reported in the past week, according to a campuswide email from Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson yesterday.
Gruber and Olson wrote that a group of four white men approached a student of Asian descent and spat on him on the 3200 block of Prospect Street on Nov. 11.
The second incident occurred Nov. 13 on the 3700 block of Prospect Street A female student, who was wearing a scarf resembling a hijab, was shoved to the ground while walking and was told by a group of four to six white men to take the scarf off.
The Metropolitan Police Department is working with GUPD to investigate the crimes.
Both Olson and Gruber confirmed to The Hoya that there has been a recent increase in bias-related incidents in the week following the presidential election.
“We have seen an increase in these incidents over the past week. We are seeking to inform and support our students — through the bias reporting system, these broad communications, and the offices and services that are always there to support students,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Georgetown Code of Student Conduct defines a bias-related incident as one in which individuals are targeted based on their actual or perceived race, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, religion or disability. Student instigators of bias-related incidents can be subject to disciplinary action, including expulsion from the university.
The email said the two students both submitted reports to GUPD and the perpetrators of both attacks were similarly described as a group of four to six white men, though there is no evidence of a connection between the two incidents.
“We are a community that welcomes all people and that values understanding, dignity, inclusion and respect. Acts of hate and bias are unacceptable and antithetical to our commitment to an inclusive and respectful community. Recently we learned of two troubling incidents involving our students that are bias-related,” the email reads. “It is unclear if they are related.”
A statement from Georgetown’s Asian American Student Association condemned the attacks while expressing solidarity with other minorities.
“We stand in solidarity with our fellow Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, African Americans, Muslim Americans, Latinx, Hispanics, immigrants, women, and members of the LGBTQ community. An attack against one group is an attack against all; we do not tolerate bigotry in any way, shape, or form. We acknowledge the intersectionality among groups and urge our community to strive towards inclusion, empathy, and understanding,” the statement reads.
Neither Olson nor Gruber provided statistics on recent bias-related incidents to The Hoya.
According to Gruber, GUPD first ensures the safety of the victims and then documents the bias-related incident.
“We make sure the person is safe, take a police report and refer the person to the bias reporting form,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Olson recommends that students who have experienced or witnessed similar incidents report them either through the online bias reporting system or a GUPD report.
“We strongly encourage any student (and any member of our community) who is experiencing assaults or threatening behavior to report it through GUPD or through the university’s bias reporting system,” Olson wrote.
AASA Political Awareness Committee Chair Meredith Peng (SFS ’17) said Asian-Americans must be more politically involved with issues regarding racial discrimination given the proximity of the recent incidents.
“Now, more than ever, we need to be in an activist mindset — that means speaking out when you see harassment, supporting one another in the face of discrimination and fighting back against hatred and bigotry,” Peng wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s terrible that this has happened so close to home — and frankly terrifying — but we can and should use this as an opportunity to unite and show solidarity.”
[…] Hoya, the student publication at Georgetown University, also reported bias-related incidents after Trump’s election, according to a Nov. 17 campus-wide email from the Georgetown […]

President Barack Obama’s collaborative tendencies were put to the test by noncompliant Republicans in Congress during his second term, according to David Simas, assistant to the president and director of the Office of Political Strategy and Outreach at the White House, at a discussion Wednesday.
The Republican-majority Congress has rendered it nearly impossible to pass legislation.
“He does not, from the beginning, tell people what their problems are that need to be solved,” Simas said. “The job of a community organizer at first is to listen to people, to identify their needs, and then, most importantly, to begin to connect them together regardless of their opinion and their points of view to form a consensus.”
Simas’ speech was the fourth installment of the McCourt School of Public Policy’s Institute of Politics and Public Service’s “The Exit Interview” series, a six-part lecture program focusing on the legacy of the Obama administration.
Wednesday’s lecture centered on the political culture in Washington, D.C., with a particular focus on Obama’s tendency to cooperate with Republicans rather than to oppose them.
“That’s always been his orientation, from a community organizer in South Chicago to the Illinois State Senate, where he would reach across the aisle and spend time with Republicans,” Simas said. “That has always been and was the predicate of what he believes — how change occurs, but also how you can bring people together.”
During the event in Lohrfink Auditorium, Simas said despite Obama’s collaborative nature, partisan clashes made it nearly impossible for him to execute his campaign promises.
Simas said Obama’s campaign promise to fix a broken political system appealed to a country divided by the war on terrorism and the 2008 economic recession.
“When Lehman Brothers collapsed on Sept. 15, 2008, our politics changed from that moment forward. The campaigns, the rhetoric, the approaches, the issues that had existed before that moment, as of that day, changed,” Simas said. “Any discussion about the Obama presidency without being rooted in that seminal moment and then what it did, not only to the populous as a whole, but also to the two political parties in response to it, that needs to be front and center.”
Simas said Obama was able to pass his stimulus bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, as well as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 because of a Democratic congressional majority during the first two years of his administration. However, Republicans were able to take control of the House of Representatives in 2010 and the Senate in 2014 because of the perception that the economy was not improving.
“Clearly the scope of what happened was bigger than folks had anticipated,” Simas said. “And in retrospect, when you have unemployment at 10 percent in that year and recovery that was beginning in very early stages, that explains to a large extent what happened.”
Simas said while Obama attempted to spur cooperation in solving America’s economic woes during his first days in government, tense relationships between Democrats and Republicans rendered this a difficult feat to accomplish. Simas owed a lot of the gridlock in the District to Republican noncompliance.
“Frankly, the strategic decision that was made at that point by our friends on the other side was, ‘They have the votes, this is going to be no matter what happens, deeply unpopular because of the fault lines of what happened in the final days of the Bush administration,’” Simas said. “‘There is going to be a hands-off approach.’”
Despite the difficult political situation faced by America, Simas urged students to become active in their communities.
“Remember who you are and what you represent. Regardless of what your political beliefs are, determine what is that North Star that you have — what is that passion of what you truly, truly believe — and even though things are hard, continue to work toward making your community, your country, the state that you live in, what thing that you are most passionate about, a little bit better than when you found it,” Simas said.
The “Exit Interview” series has previously hosted Attorney General Loretta Lynch, National Security Advisor Susan Rice and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell since its launch Sept. 15.
Maria Cornell (SFS ’20), an attendee, found Simas’ closing remarks particularly memorable.
“It was really nice to hear what David Simas had to say,” Cornell said. “Especially with his closing remarks about staying engaged despite your possible dissent towards the upcoming administration, so it was nice to hear his perspective on that, and echoing the idea that everyone has power and you can exercise it.”

Since he began his tenure as the dean of the School of Foreign Service in 2015, Joel Hellman has restructured the Dean’s Office, overseen the implementation of foreign language minors and begun preparations for the school’s centennial in 2019.
By 2019, Hellman plans to institute changes to the school’s core curriculum, require all students to participate in a form of global engagement and increase diversity in the SFS community.
A year and half into his tenure, The Hoya interviewed the dean to discuss his plans for the SFS and the impact of President-elect Donald Trump’s victory on the school’s future.
What are your greatest accomplishments from your first year?
In the first year, one of the things that we really wanted to do was take a close look and begin the process of rethinking the undergraduate curriculum. One of the first things I did was appoint a senior associate dean for the undergraduate program — we never had a faculty dean over the undergraduate program — Dan Byman.
He’s begun a conversation with faculty members, students and other inputs, and begun the first rethinking of the undergraduate curriculum that we’ve had in years, which is looking at how we make it more flexible, whether or not some of the requirements are still relevant as the global situation changes and the kinds of skill base that people need changes and how we introduce more flexibility and room for innovation in the program. I’m pleased to see that work has moved ahead. Some aspects of reforming the undergraduate curriculum have already been agreed by the faculty, and that’s a long time been coming.
What is your vision for the SFS going forward? 
I think one of the underlying principles that is motivating us is a recognition that students want to combine their liberal arts education and international affairs with an increasingly wide range of different skill sets. So it could be business; it could be arts and culture; it could be engineering and sciences; and it could be things that we can’t even anticipate.
As a result, we want to give students more flexibility to still be able to take advantage of the core skills that we think are critical for a global affairs education in economics, history, politics, but also reach a wider range of types of intellectual pursuits. Whether it’s to further a depth in a language, whether it’s creating more room for scientists to do core lab science and combine that with an international affairs degree, whether it’s allowing students to delve deeper into business, I think that’s the core principle we are trying to do.
The second core principle is how do we take advantage of our location in Washington and our commitment to service and practice to create more engagements where students are not only learning in a classroom, but applying those learnings in real practical situations. We’ve created these centennial labs, but it’s really taking advantage of a practical way of applying the knowledge we are learning in classes into practical problems. We’ve got one on drought; we’ve got one on trade; we’re developing one on global governance; and we’ve been doing policy simulations and trying to build that much more into the program.
Thirdly, we are trying to take advantage of the opportunities that are available in this area to create one-credit experiences where students could get together over an opportunity and turn that into actual credit and learning.
How do you think the recent presidential election will affect the SFS in terms of enrollment rates, curriculum or careers graduates may enter?
There has been a trend in the United States and across Europe of essentially what looks like the beginnings of a backlash against globalization, a sense of promoting the world as the others versus us. We see it in the U.S. election, but we saw it in Brexit — we see it in the increasing rise of right and populist parties across Europe. There is a global tide that is actually turning more and more of the national political dialogues of countries inwards.
In that kind of environment, the SFS has never been more important. The core mission for which the SFS was created was precisely to move in the opposite direction, to help build and preserve the foundation for our global commitments, engagements and service, to create the educational preparation for students to build global careers.
It’s even more important now, because even though the national dialogues are turning inwards, it doesn’t mean that the economic, political and multilateral relationships are unraveling. We are as entwined as we have ever been, and I think that will continue to intensify. This means that the need for our students and the preparation is as great as ever.
What are your short-term goals for the next year?
We’ve got a lot of the ideas for curriculum reform, but now we want to implement that: start to change some of the key and core requirements.
Second, one of the big priorities for our centennial is that we want to give every student the opportunity to do some form of global engagement. It may be a service or business engagement, or maybe a research and study engagement — for students to not only go abroad, but do something abroad and have a task to complete. That task gets them the experience of trying to work abroad. What we would love to do over the course of the centennial is move toward a requirement that every SFS student has a global engagement as part of their time here at Georgetown. Now, we’re not going to get that overnight, but next year we really want to focus on creating more engagement experiences.
Do the centennial labs fit into your vision for the centennial, which has been a focus for the SFS over the last year?
The centennial vision committee also talked about the importance of strengthening the international component of our student body and really building a stronger international student base, so we better reflect the diversity of the world in which we make decisions. We are really pleased to see a strong spike in international students this year and partly because of efforts to reach out more strongly to international and strengthen the yield to international students. We want to invest significantly to try to increase scholarship support for international students and others to bring in a greater diversity into the SFS classroom.
If you were to choose three things that you would like to accomplish by the time we reach the centennial, what would they be?
We’ve introduced the concept of sophomore seminars, and we want to build in a peak experience every year in the SFS undergraduate experience, like you have your proseminar as a freshman. Your senior year would be some kind of capstone or practice-oriented experience in which you are applying ideas in a setting you wish to enter, like simulations, service engagements.
The second thing is building up and strengthening the diversity of our SFS student body — global diversity as well as socio-economic diversity. I think that is just so critical to the quality of conversation that we have in our classrooms that if we can build up a stronger financial aid pool to attract an even more diverse set of students, domestically and internationally, I think that would be another core priority.
Lastly, the priority of giving every student the opportunity to do a global engagement would be something I would really love to achieve and is a “must achieve” for the centennial.

Representatives on the Council of Advisory Boards voted against endorsing a referendum to abolish the Georgetown University Student Association senate and replace it with a new elected assembly Nov. 11.
The elected assembly’s primary responsibility would be to allocate about $1 million through a collaborative process between student organization advisory board representatives and four elected student representatives from each class.
The Student Activities Commission, Performing Arts Advisory Council and the Advisory Board for Club Sports voted in support of the referendum and the Campus Ministry Student Forum voted against, while the Center for Social Justice’s Advisory Board for Student Organizations and the Media Board abstained. CAB consists of one representative from each of the six club advisory boards.
Despite their decision to not endorse the referendum, individual advisory board representatives said the referendum was popular among members of their boards.
The student body will vote on whether to approve the new assembly in a university-wide referendum Dec. 1. One-fourth of the undergraduate population must vote in support of the plan for the referendum to pass.
CAB Chair Janhvi Bhojwani (SFS ’17) said the three advisory boards that did not vote to endorse the reform were reluctant to trust a new funding system under the proposed assembly.
Currently, the allocation of the student activities budget fee is determined by the GUSA senate’s Finance and Appropriations Committee, which hears presentations from advisory boards, the Georgetown Program Board and the Lecture Fund before submitting a budget for approval by the senate.
“Some advisory boards actually prefer this current system. They’re happy with the way things currently work, and they’ve gotten most of their financial asks throughout the years,” Bhojwani said. “Some groups that abstained from voting felt that the entire process of this restructure was really rushed and that we’re making all of these changes and we don’t know whether they will actually be good or bad since it would only go into effect during the next academic year.”
Campus Ministry Student Forum Treasurer Jared Ison (SFS ’17) said the group voted against endorsing the referendum because the current funding system works for CMSF.
“We understand that the current FinApp process doesn’t work for other groups, but CMSF has seen its requests met and we would have rather continued to reform the existing system that had worked for us,” Ison wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our ultimate vote of no was meant to express our concerns with the plan, but in a productive and collaborative way.”
According to Ison, there were also concerns over whether the reform plan will effectively address problems facing the current funding process and the timeline for passing budgets.
However, Bhojwani said she has experienced problems with the current system for club funding allocations.
“As advisory boards, we’ve had issues with the way the current system works. We have had a lack of an effective voice, and there’s also a lot of volatility in our individual budgets from year to year. It’s been extremely unreliable, there’s a lack of transparency and there’s no way to guarantee impartiality,” Bhojwani said.
Advisory Board for Club Sports Chair Daniel Fain (COL ‘18) said the proposed restructuring is a necessary change to the current funding and appropriations system.
“I support it wholeheartedly. I think that it’s a needed change. Anyone who’s been involved in the funding process, especially from the Advisory Board’s side acknowledges that there are serious problems with our current system,” Fain said.
Fain said the new elected assembly could facilitate better collaboration and representation among the club advisory boards.
“I’m strongly in support because I think this allows advisory boards to collaborate amongst themselves, especially when it comes to things like large projects. I also like that it gives advisory boards a substantive voice. The fact that we have a vote in the final voting process is huge,” Fain said.
GUSA Senate Speaker Richie Mullaney (COL ’18) said the reform is intended to address problems with how club funding is currently allocated.
“We’ve looked at how the senate has functioned for the last decade and looked at good things and bad things, and we’ve really decided that we need to reform the way we do club funding,” Mullaney said. “Over the last 15 years, control over the student activity fee has shifted from advisory boards to the GUSA senate. We want to restore proper club representation in the process.”
GUSA Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) said the new appropriations structure would give club leaders a larger say in the funding process.
“Some of the most frequent complaints that we got at the beginning of our term were from club leaders who felt like their voices were not heard in the club funding process,” Fisk said. “This is one step towards making sure the experts in these areas play a role in deciding exactly where their money is going.”
Bhojwani agreed that the new elected assembly would give club advisory boards an important voice in the budgeting process.
“Personally, I see both pros and cons to this new system, and ultimately I feel it could be an improvement in comparison to what we currently have,” Bhojwani said. “As advisory boards and stakeholders, we would be playing a more substantial role in the funding process, and I think it’s an important and necessary change because we finally get a voice in something that has a significant impact on the way we operate as funding boards and serve our groups.”

President-elect Donald Trump’s future administrative appointments could spark a significant rollback of transgender rights in the military, according to panelists hosted by the Georgetown LGBTQ Resource Center and the Georgetown University Veterans Office on Monday.
Georgetown’s Veterans Office Director LeNaya Hezel moderated the conversation between Shane McCammon, a veteran and graduate of the George Washington University Law School who studies issues affecting transgender individuals in the military, and Paula Neira, a lawyer, nurse and transgender Navy veteran.
McCammon said it is possible that under the Trump administration, the Pentagon may reinstate a ban on transgender individuals serving openly in the military, which was lifted June 30.
“Unfortunately, what happened Tuesday night has come so close in time to when this policy was going to come out,” McCammon said. “This is stuff that’s still being discussed and hammered out at the Pentagon. Hopefully there’s enough traction to keep this policy going, but I’m not super hopeful.”
Trump’s appointment to the Secretary of Defense position could reinstate the transgender ban without requiring approval from Congress or the courts, according to Neira.
“There was never a constitutional ruling about whether you can discriminate in the military against LGBT folks,” Neira said. “The transgender issue is completely within the authority of the executive branch. It can change with the mere stroke of a pen.”
However, Neira said reinstating the transgender ban may prove to be difficult, as the military has already begun to implement changes reflecting the new policy. Neira said it is more likely the ban will remain lifted, but the Republican-controlled Congress will pass a ‘religious liberty’ amendment in the next defense appropriations bill.
According to Neira, this provision would allow military personnel to discriminate against LGBTQ service members, justifying their conduct through religious beliefs.
“LGBT folks are going to be able to serve in the military, but if they are in a chain of command that wants to harass them, their chain of command is probably going to get away with it,” Neira said.
McCammon, whose law school thesis advocated for the removal of the U.S. military transgender ban, said evidence suggests military units function better when LGBTQ members are allowed to serve openly.
“When you boil it down, things work better when people are open and honest with each other,” McCammon said. “I’ve been deployed. I could really care less who’s sleeping with who, who’s using which bathroom; I care about if my colleague has my back and is doing his or her job. And I think more and more people are starting to understand that.”
Neira said her battle with transgender discrimination began in the United States Naval Academy, at a time when she was struggling with her own gender identity.
“At the time I knew something was different about my gender, but for me the military was a calling,” Neira said. “I knew since the time I was little being a naval officer was what I wanted to do. And I couldn’t say anything to anybody in the military, because the minute I asked for help, I would get kicked out.”
Neira said she faced a difficult choice between her identity and her career when trying to embrace her identity and start sex reassignment surgery.
“The hardest decision I ever made was telling the Navy I couldn’t stay. And again, I couldn’t tell them why,” Neira said.
After leaving the Navy, Neira attended nursing school and then law school. She became an advocate in the fight to allow LGBTQ people to serve openly in the military. Neira said her experiences in the Navy prompted her to jump into the fight.
“The sacrifice I had to make put me on the path to get involved,” Neira said. “I’m very humble and proud to be one of the people who helped lead the fight to change the Navy and the military so that today, LGBT kids don’t have to make those same sacrifices. And they’re going to be able to have the career that I couldn’t.”

Thanks for this excellent article! We’ve posted it on our Facebook page at https://facebook.com/ucc.coalition. We’re a coalition of 1,300 churches in the United Church of Christ that welcome and advocate for LGBTQ people in the church and in society. Understanding what direction the Trump Administration will take on LGBTQ civil rights is obviously a moving target: your article reinforces my concern that transgender people are especially at risk because their protections are largely the result of executive actions by the Obama Administration, which can easily be reversed. By the way, I’m a former Hoya news editor (1972-3). Delighted to see this standard of journalism kept alive!

The use of graphic anti-smoking labels could drastically reduce the smoking mortality rate over the coming decades, according to a Georgetown University Medical Center study published Nov. 3 in the international peer-review journal Tobacco Control.
The investigation is the first one ever to estimate the effects of pictorial warnings on cigarette packs on the health of both adults and infants in the U.S. Researchers found these labels could prevent more than 652,000 deaths, 92,000 low-birth-weight infants, 145,000 preterm births and 1,000 cases of sudden infant deaths in the U.S. over the next 50 years.
Currently, the U.S. requires a text-only warning on the side of cigarette packs, although more than 70 other nations have adopted or are considering adopting the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, which calls for front- and back-of-the-pack pictorial warnings.
The study compared changes in the smoking rates of countries that have adopted graphic warning labels with smoking rates in the U.S. using SimSmoke, a tobacco control policy model developed by GUMC Professor of Oncology David Levy.
Levy said this research provides a clear mandate that U.S. officials should make enforcing graphic warning labels a priority.
“Between my study and several other studies that have been done, we now have very strong evidence of the effects,” Levy said. “It shows that this policy that should have been implemented five years ago would have saved many lives, reduced medical costs substantially and had a major impact on the public health of people in the U.S.”
The Food and Drug Administration instated pictorial warning label requirements for all cigarette packages in 2009, but the requirement was struck down in a federal court the same year on the grounds that the labeling unconstitutionally limited the tobacco companies’ right to freedom of speech.
Researcher Darren Mays, an assistant professor of oncology, said they designed the research to generate evidence that would inform the process of tobacco regulation in the U.S. and provide sufficient evidence of the impact of labels on smoking behavior.
“Contrary to the court ruling striking down FDA’s initial requirements, our analysis shows that pictorial warnings will have substantial public health benefits in terms of reducing smoking and preventing smoking-related death and disease,” Mays wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This evidence should be timely as the FDA proceeds to make the case that such a policy is needed and warranted to reduce the burden of smoking in the U.S.”
Levy added that his team was not surprised by the results of the study, citing past studies on the effects of graphic warning labels, including one conducted by GUMC last year linking cigarette packaging to brain activity. However, he said this study goes beyond past studies by looking at actual policy instead of simply assessing the impact of warning labels on smoker behavior.
“We knew what to expect. There were no surprises there. It’s based on past studies on this problem, so that idea was to come up with what would be the effect of a policy that was supposed to be implemented, but was not implemented,” Levy said.
Smoke-Free Georgetown founder Henry Callander (COL ’18), who successfully launched a petition in October to hold a student-wide referendum banning smoking on campus, said he hoped the study will help policymakers implement measures to deter smokers from purchasing cigarettes.
“If graphic images on cigarette boxes decreases the amount of people who smoke cigarettes, Smoke-Free Georgetown believes that these types of graphics would only be a good thing for a more positive future global health,” Callander wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Five members of the Georgetown University Native American Student Council protested the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on Thursday in Red Square.
The group silently demonstrated for approximately an hour, holding signs that read “Georgetown: Stand with Standing Rock!” and “You Can’t Drink Oil.”
The Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,172-mile project slated to carry crude oil across four states, was originally approved in July by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The pipeline’s construction has been met with strong objection from a number of Native American tribes in the Midwest who argue that it would cross sacred land belonging to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.
The Army Corps of Engineers has found that the route would have minimal environmental impact, while the Environmental Protection Agency has denounced the construction, as the pipeline will cross the tribe’s source of drinking water.
Protesters and the police have clashed in recent weeks according to The Washington Post, sparking the popular #NoDAPL campaign on social media.
In late October, Facebook users used the “check-in” to show their location at the Standing Rock Reservation feature to show solidarity with the tribe.
NASC President Rebecca Yates (COL ’17), who is a native Mescalero Apache, said the protest is looking to bring attention to a cause that has not been frequently covered in the past.
“This has been an issue for a long time, but the media wasn’t really reporting it until the violence started, which kind of sends out a general vibe that these people are almost dispensable — that has been really disheartening to see,” Yates said.
The Center for Social Justice has expressed support for NASC.
“CSJ supports its student organizations’ social justice work — whether that is direct service, community-based learning, advocacy, or activism, such as today’s protest in Red Square of the Dakota Access Pipeline,” CSJ Executive Director Andria Wisler wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Solidarity in the form of NASC’s protest and presence today is an example of living out our Jesuit values which implore us to bear witness to injustice in ways that meet community needs.”
According to NASC board member Hannah Wingett (COL ’19), whose father was raised on the Winnebago Reservation in Nebraska, Dakota Access, LLC — the company constructing the pipeline —does not recognize the potential consequences of its project.
“We need to show that this is not black and white and while there are economic interests at stake, there are also human lives at stake,” Wingett said.
Wingett said she hopes the pipeline plans for construction are cancelled in the coming months.
“Idealistically, the pipeline is stopped. No more construction — it’s just done. In an ideal world, the company building the pipeline would care, and they would stop, and this would be done,” Wingett said. “Realistically though, the best case is that the pipeline is diverted away from the reservation because there is a massive problem with the construction going through their burial grounds, through cultural lands.”
Yates said she is uncertain what the future holds for the Standing Rock Sioux given the election of President-elect Donald Trump, who has financial investments in the Dakota Access, LLC, according to environmental blog EcoWatch.
“For us, Trump is just complete uncertainty. I am concerned that in his plan, he seems to be more dependent on the fossil fuel industry, which shows that it’s possible that he might do what he can to just bulldoze through this project,” Yates said.
Matt Lettiero (COL ’20), who observed the demonstration, said the protest deserved attention from the Georgetown community.
“It is their right to protest and given the history of injustice through mistreatment and mishandling of Native Americans in the past, this should be given special consideration,” Lettiero said.

Immediate action must be taken to stop climate change in light of environmentally induced displacement of refugees, according to a panel discussion organized by the Environmental Futures Initiative in the Mortara Center on Monday.
Program Director for the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship James Olsen, who is a faculty member in the EFI, moderated the panel, which included advocacy organization Refugees International Climate Displacement Program Manager Alice Thomas, Environmental Law Center attorney Sofia Yazykova and anthropology professor Mubbashir Rizvi.
Olsen said the issue of refugees displaced by climate change is extremely important in the context of today’s issues.
“I just think that it’s such an incredibly important topic. It’s one that somehow we’ve kind of been able to ignore,” Olsen said. “We’re talking about potentially a billion people that are living in these vulnerable populations that are going to be migrating in coming years.”
Climate change poses serious challenges to communities worldwide, from low-lying island-nations menaced by a rising ocean to regions in sub-Saharan Africa susceptible to drought, according to Thomas. Thomas said the countries least responsible for climate change may be the most affected, as shown by the 2011 Somalia famine, which killed 260,000 people.
“I think there is a huge justice component of what’s happening here, because invariably the people who are worst impacted are those who are least responsible for climate change,” Thomas said.
Yazykova said the issue is compounded by the issue of people displaced by natural disasters not being protected by international conventions on refugees.
“They don’t fall under the standard definition of refugees because they’re not escaping persecution, they’re trying to escape due to environmental causes,” Yazykova said.
According to Yazykova, countries must cooperate to deal with displaced populations. Yazykova urged more countries to adopt measures to allow for the relocation of climate-displaced refuges from Pacific island-nations threatened by high sea levels.
Rizvi said climate change is both causing a refugee crisis and deepening divisions in the world.
“On the one hand, we’re thinking about humanity as becoming more and more vulnerable as a whole together,” Rizvi said. “We’re also seeing a disconnect, or perhaps a breakdown of what it means to be human because of the increased inequality between, let’s say, the refugees, citizens, people in the poorer parts of the world.”
The panelists also expressed concern as to whether President-elect Donald Trump would follow through on his campaign promise to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, which commits almost 20 countries to reduce emissions. A particular problem highlighted by the panelists was the prospect of the United States withdrawing funds for developing nations deal with the effects of climate change.
According to Yazykova, Trump’s campaign promise to pull out of international climate change engagements could exacerbate the issues faced by countries by reducing funds for developing nations dealing with the effects of climate change and increasing the number of migrants from impacted areas.
“If a state is already experiencing problems of climate change, that might actually facilitate conflict in that state,” Yazykova said. “So there might be a civil war, for example, breaking out so again, migration will increase.”
Thomas said students should pressure federal, state and local governments to act on climate change if the Trump administration withdraws the United States from its climate change commitments. Addressing climate change now is essential, according to Thomas.
“I think where we need to be looking in the future is what can happen at the state and local level,” Thomas said. “That’s true for climate mitigation, it’s true for adaptation. We don’t have time for these people of four years to decide whatever they’re going to decide, we don’t have time in two years.”
In an interview with The Hoya, Olsen said the next administration may be forced to respond to climate change differently from how it intends because of a potential refugee crisis.
“It’s the sort of thing where politicians can have a certain stance, they can take a sort of ideological position but they can also sometimes get overwhelmed by events,” Olsen said.
Yoel Fessahhaye (SFS ’18) said he is hopeful public pressure would lead to the United States taking action to help climate refugees even under a Trump administration.
“We all know what it means to leave your home, whether it be political persecution or stuff like this,” Fessahaye said. “So I think we can all relate and I think in that sense there will be some backlash if President-elect Donald Trump does not do anything about this.”
Correction: This article previously stated the event was organized by the Global Futures Initiative; it was organized by the Environmental Futures Initiative. This article has also been updated to reflect that James Olsen is a faculty member in the EFI.

The Private Security Camera System Incentive Program has created a network of more than 1,000 security cameras on homes and businesses to help Washington, D.C. law enforcement monitor crime.
The program, first proposed by Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) in 2015, provides rebates for property owners to purchase security cameras in exchange for registering them in a Metropolitan Police Department database. This exchange allows MPD to access video footage while investigating criminal activity with the permission of the property owner.
Similar programs have been implemented in cities including Chicago and Philadelphia, which both offer rebates for private residence owners to install security cameras.
Office of Victim Services and Justice Grants Special Assistant Christopher Dyer, who administers the program, said the office had approved over 1,100 applications and issued over 1,000 rebates totaling $380,000 as of Oct. 31.
“The program has gone pretty well so far,” Dyer said. “It’s been a very successful program, and we’ve had full participation in all eight wards.”
The Private Security Camera System Incentive Program refunds owners up to $200 per camera, with a maximum of $500 per residence and $750 per business or church. The D.C. Council allocated $500,000 to the program in 2015.
Dyer said OVSJG is looking to introduce a voucher program to address the D.C. residents who cannot afford to purchase a security camera and thus cannot qualify for a rebate.
“We want everyone in the city to be able to participate. We are in the process of investigating and hope to be launching a voucher program in the near future,” Dyer said. “The voucher program will help those who cannot afford to purchase a camera system.”
Bowser said the program has already fostered a safer climate in the District.
“I am thrilled that so many people have taken advantage of the program,” Bowser said in an Oct. 17 press release. “On multiple occasions since the program was launched, MPD has used camera video to aid in criminal investigations and the apprehension of suspects.”
The MPD reported 26,836 instances of property crime in 2015 and 25,744 instances in 2016 as of Nov. 17.
Georgetown University Police Chief Jay Gruber said MPD has long pressed for the security camera program, stressing its necessity for the safety and security of the D.C. community.
“MPD really does need this program,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The ability to gather evidence of a crime helps to increase the closure rate of crimes, making the city safer.”
Kunaal Singh (MSB ’20) said although police must ask for permission before accessing footage, he worries about potential for police to breach individuals’ privacy when investigating crimes.
“Privacy can be very much put in danger by this program, but I think you have to take into consideration that the government doesn’t make people participate in this program,” Singh said. “They get added protection and security. It’s very much like an economic cost-benefit analysis.”
