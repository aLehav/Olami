Though the number of crimes committed on campus rose in October, theft remained the most frequently reported violation.
There were a total of 45 reported crimes in October, a slight increase from the 42 incidents that occurred in September.
Although theft remained the most commonly occurring crime, the number of incidents has decreased. In October, 14 thefts occurred, compared to the 20 that occurred in September.
For crimes of theft, the Department of Public Safety distinguishes between theft in the first degree and theft in the second degree.
According to Associate Director of Public Safety Joseph Smith, theft in the first degree occurs when someone takes or uses the property of someone else that is equivalent to $1,000 or greater. In the second degree, the property simply must be of some value.
This more minor violation is the most commonly reported incident on campus. Though there were three first-degree thefts in the month of September, none were reported in October.
The university also saw a decrease in the number of on-campus burglaries with the number of reported incidents dropping from 10 to one.
DPS also categorizes these incidents in two ways.
Burglary 1 is defined as a crime that occurs in the sleeping area of a residence when the suspect has the intention to take something while someone is present at the residence. DPS differentiates Burglary 2 as an incident when any room, building or vessel is entered with the intention of taking something with or without someone present.
There were no second-degree burglaries during October.
Of the total 45 reported crimes, 14 are still pending. A total of nine of the cases have been closed, three of which included Metropolitan Police Department arrests. Two of the arrests involved non-Georgetown affiliates, one for driving while intoxicated and the other for assault of a Georgetown student, while the third was arrested after being apprehended with a stolen bike.
Five of the cases closed because there were no leads, and in one instance the complainants did not wish to pursue the matter further.
The remaining incident was closed because the case was determined to be unfounded. What was originally thought to be a break-in was actually the result of damage to the building. No items were found missing, and the case was dropped.
A total of 19 cases were forwarded to student conduct.

If everything is supposed to be bigger in Texas, then why is there only one male Division I soccer program in the entire state? The answer to this question is quite simple, but also controversial.
When Title IX of the Education Amendments was enacted in 1972, it intended to bring an end to the exclusion of women in federally funded programs. One of the first entities to draw the ire of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, a now-defunct office that oversaw the implementation of Title IX, was the NCAA.
In 1975, universities were given three years to comply with the regulations, no small task for large universities with multi-million dollar athletic budgets. As hard as the NCAA fought against Title IX, it was implemented with harsh penalties. No schools or programs were exempt from this law. Finally, women could participate in college athletics in equal numbers as men.  Sounds great, right? Not so fast, my friend.
While Title IX’s goals are admirable, it has not worked out in practice as it was meant to. Its implementation dictated that colleges had to balance the numbers of female and male athletes to mirror the student population at their institutions. In theory, it was as simple as creating more female sports teams to even out the number of scholarship athletes between the two genders. But in practice, many males suffered as a result of this legislation.
Male athletes from all over the country were told that their sports would be cut and they would have to provide an education for themselves. Young men who had dreamt of playing a sport in college, many of whom could not pay for an education if it weren’t for their full-ride scholarships, were left out to dry.
That isn’t equality, but a ludicrous attempt to justify more discrimination. Not one critic of Title IX will argue that creating more athletic opportunities for women is a bad thing. But discriminating against males to fill a quota for athletic departments is just as wrong as exclusion.
Fast-forward almost 40 years from its creation, and the argument rages on. George Will, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, sums up the debate succinctly: “Colleges have killed more than 400 athletic teams in order to produce precise proportionality between men’s and women’s enrollments and men’s and women’s rates of participation in athletics. If participation in sports must mirror the sexual composition of the student body, why not participation in the engineering department?”
Besides some nice alliteration, Will hits at the nerve of the argument. He is essentially saying that it is impossible to create demand where it simply doesn’t exist. An example of this is the use of “roster management.” It is not uncommon for a coach of a male sports team to be asked by an administrator to cut some players from his team. On the other hand, coaches of female teams are often asked to inflate their roster so that the university is within the bounds of Title IX.
Neither men nor women win in this situation. Men’s teams lose because they have to cut valuable members from their roster. Women’s teams do not benefit either by artificially adding to their rosters. Either way, the synthetic boost of women in college athletics is wrong, and both sides feel the negative effects of it.
The Title IX legislation was necessary, of course, when blatant sexism existed in college athletics. I am not trying to say that it should be repealed — equality needs to exist, especially when amateur athletes are involved. However, major changes need to be made.
Instead of essentially handing schools a quota of how many men and women it can have on scholarship in any given year, equality can be achieved on a sport-by-sport basis. The argument that a men’s team should be cut because it is denying a woman the same opportunity is a non sequitur. The argument loses even more credibility when many athletic departments could fund a full slate of both men’s and women’s sports, but are forced to make cuts due to Title IX.
Currently, the NCAA sponsors about 1,000 more teams for women than they do for men. That wasn’t Title IX’s goal. As a result, both male and female athletes are suffering. A fairer Title IX needs to be equal to both genders. Two wrongs don’t make a right, but two wrongs certainly led to the creation of Title IX and its subsequent establishment of even more discrimination.

European Union Ambassador to the United States Joao Vale de Almeida addressed the future of Europe and its currency as well as Poland’s future role in the European Union in an event Tuesday at the Mortara Center.
In his speech, held by Klub Polski, Vale de Almeida emphasized how Poland, whose president is the current chair of the Council of the E.U., exemplifies European integration and democracy in light of the region’s complicated past as a dictatorship.
“If there is one reason that justifies everything that we have been doing in Europe in the last 50 to 60 years, it is modern day Poland,” he said.
Vale de Almeida went on to discuss the euro crisis and its implications for the European continent. He expressed belief that both the E.U. and the monetary system will recover from their current state of crisis. The euro is both a political and an economic project, he said, while he blamed the global financial crisis in 2008 for the current European monetary instability.
“We are now suffering from what I would call the aftershocks of [the] crisis,” he said in an interview with The Hoya. “The international context, instead of helping us solve the problem, aggravates the problem.”
Vale de Almeida noted the interconnected nature of world economies’ effect on the currency, adding that the E.U. is faring better than the United States in the magnitude of its budget deficit and public debt on average.
“We cannot throw the first stone, because we are all vulnerable,” he said in response to U.S. worries about the European economy.
Vale de Almeida further stated that economies around the world ultimately share the same problems.
“It’s very difficult in today’s globalized world to make a distinction … where my problems start and where other people’s problems start,” he said to The Hoya.
Vale de Almeida hoped that the European Union and the United States would be able to repair Europe’s monetary system by working through the International Monetary Fund and through negotiations with the G-20 Financial Ministers and Central Bank Governors.
“We either swim together or we go down together. There is no real alternative to this,” he said to The Hoya.
Vale de Almeida noted that the E.U. has already given unprecedented levels of aid to failing economies, like Greece and Portugal.
“We went to the limits of what the treaties, that is our constitution, allows us to do,” he said. “But it is clear today that we have to do more.”
Vale de Almeida also argued that the E.U. needs a comprehensive plan to address the mechanisms used to handle economic crises. This week marks a series of talks among the financial ministers in Brussels about how to recapitalize European banks and efficiently respond to issues.
For students in attendance, Vale De Almeida’s speech allowed for an enhanced understanding of the debt crises.
“The man was representing not just one, but 27 nations in the E.U. It was cool to see, in his words, ‘the direct product of the Lisbon treaty’ speak and hear him energetically defend the euro,” Elaine Colligan(SFS ’15) said.
For the ambassador, a unified currency is the best way to utilize the integrated free markets and unified economic policies in Europe.
“I have no doubt that the euro will survive,” Vale de Almeida said. “Europe will come out of this crisis fitter and stronger.”

To celebrate the establishment of official diplomatic relations between the United States and the Vatican, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation sponsored an academic conference Tuesday in Gaston Hall.
Georgetown is one of six universities across the nation holding events to celebrate the Ronald Reagan Centennial Celebration, a year-long tribute marking the 100th anniversary of Reagan’s birth. The president’s appointment of an ambassador to the Holy See in 1984 is now recognized as one of Reagan’s major achievements.
Reagan hoped that such a relationship with the Holy See would serve as a way to cultivate a bulwark against the influence of communism in Europe and around the world. Frederick J. Ryan Jr., chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation Board of Trustees, emphasized Reagan’s belief that the war against communism was a moral struggle. Pope John Paul II harbored these same worries in the1980s, a commonality that helped the two form a lasting relationship, according to Ryan.
John O’Sullivan, author of “The President, the Pope and the Prime Minister,” delivered the keynote address, which focused on the ethics underlying the foreign policy of the United States and the Vatican.
“Moral rather than military motives [were] what defined Reagan’s policy against the Soviets,” he said.
Touching upon the theme of the event, “The History and Future of Vatican Diplomacy,” O’Sullivan paid homage to the Holy See’s long and international political influence while also looking to the issues that governments and the Catholic Church confront today, such as human trafficking.
Dean of the School of Foreign Service Carol Lancaster moderated the panel discussion, which included several high-profile figures such as Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, archbishop emeritus of the Archdiocese of Washington. McCarrick applauded the lasting and influential foreign diplomacy of the Holy See.
Lancaster alluded to the soft power of the Vatican, which panelists agreed plays a significant role in international affairs. She noted that in the modern world, military and economic power, while important, can play second fiddle to religion, which is traditionally seen as a soft power.
“The Holy See plays a great role in promoting justice and human rights,” she said.
Echoing the thoughts of his colleagues, Joseph K. Grieboski, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the Institute on Religion and Public Policy, added that human rights activists benefit tremendously from the discourse between the Vatican and the United States.
“This is an overlooked and underappreciated relationship,” he said.
As former ambassadors to the Vatican, both Francis Rooney and R. James Nicholson discussed the connection between the Church’s message and the priority of U.S. foreign policy to universally enhance human dignity.
“The Holy See has a very honest agenda united by faith and purpose,” Rooney said.
Grieboski offered concluding thoughts about the importance of the Pope’s role as a moral voice to the United States.
“Georgetown is the best place for this discussion and for the conversation to continue because of the nexus of the Catholic university to its location in the nation’s capital,” he said.

The Food and Drug Administration awarded  a $1 million grant to fund the establishment of a Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation at the Georgetown University Medical Center.
“CERSI is vitally important because sound regulation requires the highest levels of science and evidence,” said Lawrence Gostin, co-principal investigator for the project. “It will affect Georgetown by making our research highly relevant in the country and the world. CERSI fits perfectly within University President John J. DeGioia’s university-wide initiative on reflective engagement.”
The center will provide students the opportunity to work in an intensive research environment, run by FDA scientists, that is applicable to their academic interests. According to Gostin, working with the FDA on real-world issues will offer students a more well-rounded educational experience.
“[They will have the] opportunity to work on major policy issues in food, drugs, medical devices and tobacco,” Gostin said. “It also allows FDA staff to learn and teach at the university.”
Georgetown is the second university to receive a grant for this research. The University of Maryland has already developed its own program in conjunction with the FDA, compiling a team of experts to develop new drugs and perform laboratory examinations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of various technologies.
Georgetown’s CERSI is expected to open within the coming months and plans to work collaboratively with its Maryland counterpart.
“We each have our own strengths, and we are also very close colleagues. I really welcome our partners from Maryland [and hope they will] be working with us well into the future,” Gostin said.

The Dean’s Office of the School of Foreign Service announced significant changes to the Certificate in International Development Program Thursday that will affect current freshmen and sophomores.
The changes in the program’s structure will reduce the number of electives needed while requiring students to take one of several approved quantitative courses, as well as an intermediate level course in international development.
SFS Deans Mitch Kaneda and Kendra Billingslea, who will oversee the program’s administration, announced the quantitative shift.
“We’ve tried to give a little bit of form and substance to the certificate, and part of that involves a little more emphasis on analytical tools and methodologies,” Raj Desai, director of the IDEV program, said. “The field is changing to the point that if you don’t graduate with those skills, you will be at adisadvantage.”
Visiting assistant professor Shareen Joshi, who teaches the gateway course for the IDEV certificate, said that students who do not develop these kinds of analytical skills during their training are being done a great disservice.
“I think regardless of whether you work for a small [nongovernmental organization] or a big international organization, or go to graduate school, that skill set is required, not optional, anymore,”Joshi said.
Desai and Joshi added that their experience working with former Georgetown graduates who lack these skills indicated the need for a change in the program.
“It’s very difficult. They don’t have a lot of options when it comes to job placement if they cannot read a regression table or if they don’t know what a poverty table is,” Desai said.
Another change in the program is the elimination of elective course subfields. Desai hopes that this change will allow more flexibility in terms of students’ interests by allowing them to take all three electives in the same area of study.
Many students are excited about the prospect of more flexibility within the program.
“If it means that students have more say in their education … I am all for it,” Sonia Kikeri (SFS ’13) said.
The new program will be the first certificate administered through the dean’s office, rather than through another academic department within the university. Kaneda hopes that this change will provide the necessary support for launching the new program.
In addition to explaining the certificate’s changes, Desai swiftly dispelled last semester’s rumors that the certificate was being disbanded.
“You have two deans, an administrator and core faculty who are now involved,” he said. “It is not going anywhere. I wouldn’t have taken the directorship had it been the case that it was being eliminated.”

It is midnight on the third floor of Darnall, and a small group of freshmen are chatting as they watch TV and plug away at their homework. As a Catholic priest strolls in with a plate of freshly baked treats, a student yells down the hall,”Fr. McManus has cookies!” and more residents quickly spill into the common room.
At work is campus ministry’s residential ministry, directed by Michelle Siemietkowski (COL ’92). The program boasts 26 chaplains-in-residence and Jesuits-in-residence who live among students in university-owned housing.
The purpose of the program stems from the university’s commitment to providing chaplaincy service for students 24 hours a day, Siemietkowski said. But the program is much more than attractive language for an admissions brochure.
“CIRs and JIRs also reach out to students who may have particular needs or particular considerations, which is a really special service that we provide,” Siemietkowski said. “A chaplain can show up on a student’s floor with cookies and ask ‘Hey, how are mid-terms going?’ and really connect with students. They do a lot of outreach.”
For husband and wife chaplain team Zeyneb and Salih Sayilgan, who reside on the second floor of New South, the opportunity for outreach inspired them to serve as on-campus mentors.
“I think the chaplaincy program is creating a sense of community in this diverse university. It gives us a chance to engage with students, learn from them and serve them,” Salih Sayilgan said.
“We believe that loving God means to serve his creatures, and this is one way to do that,” Zeyneb added. “This is one way for us to serve students, to be a resource. We are students ourselves, so we can relate to them and their concerns.”
With a New South apartment overlooking the Potomac, the two balance their roles as chaplains with their pursuit of doctoral degrees. Zeyneb, originally from Germany, is studying theology at Georgetown, while Salih, originally from Turkey, commutes to the Catholic University of America. The Muslim couple, who met at a religious conference, foster their own religion and relationship through their work as chaplains.
“We don’t like scholars who get caught up in the ivory tower and don’t share their knowledge with people. We want to live within the community, see what the problems are, and share our knowledge,” Zeyneb said. “For us, the academic life and our occupation as chaplains create a great balance.”
Reverend Elaine Hall, a Protestant Methodist chaplain living on New South’s first floor, sees her ministry of guidance and baked goods not only as a way to satisfy a hunger for the physical and spiritual, but also as a way of connecting with residents. She recalled a situation where a student who initially made contact during an open house eventually opened up to her about a serious, personal situation.
“I realized this job was the perfect place for me in this moment. A student who really needed to talk to someone chose me to connect with, because of something I had done,” Hall said. “All of those cookies meant more than just all those calories.”
For Siemietkowski, this dedication to religion and willingness to serve others makes the chaplains a strong resource on campus.
“I look for significant pastoral education, training and experience. I look for commitment to one’s faith tradition and an openness to all faith traditions. The chaplains need good skills with undergraduate students and the ability to remain calm in times of crisis.”
Siemietkowski also focuses on fostering diversity among her chaplaincy staff.
“Our CIRs and JIRs not only represent a variety of faith traditions but also represent a variety of professions,” she said. “Some are professors here at Georgetown. Some are full-time high school teachers. Some are finishing their doctoral programs while teaching at the graduate level. Some are pastors in churches, and some are chaplains in hospitals.”
For Siemietkowski, these connections reinforce Georgetown’s focus on interreligious understanding. She emphasized that CIRs and JIRs are chaplains to all of the students, no matter their faith tradition — even if they have no faith tradition at all.
This range of diverse backgrounds and faiths serves to break down barriers between students and their chaplains. Siemietkowski credits the casual and relaxed atmosphere that the chaplains and Jesuits provide with students’ increasing acceptance of the Hilltop as a new home.
“What makes me really happy is when students knock on our door in a very desperate way, often when they can’t talk to anyone else, and we welcome them and we talk to them and when they leave with a smile on their face, that is a great pleasure to us,” Salih said.
Hall echoed this same sentiment.
“I think having folks on campus who are intentionally trying to facilitate these connections is really important,” she said.
Hall’s New South abode is also home to her husband and 3-year-old son Martin, who has lived on campus since birth. The students on the floor appreciate having a young family as their neighbor, she said — and for Martin, the feeling is mutual.
“Martin loves being around students, which has been a great deal for us,” she said.
As the program continues to grow, Siemietkowski hopes for continued collaboration among faith traditions, while ensuring a commitment to greater Jesuit ideals. She hopes to continue programs such as this year’s “Relationship Series,” held by the Office of Campus Ministry and featuring the input of several chaplains, in order to cultivate these ideas.
Siemietkowski added that the chaplain-in-residence on-call system helps maintain sufficient spiritual support for students; chaplains and Jesuits-in-residence are available at a specific phone number throughout the day for emergency guidance.
“Committed to the Jesuit ideal of cura personalis, Georgetown is very proud to say chaplains are available for students 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,” she said.
According to Zeyneb Sayilgan, the program is an integral part of Georgetown’s identity.
“I love the concept of chaplains in residence. I wish every university would have them, because if you really want to have good students, the education must be more than the intellectual,” she said. “You need to address the human being on so many various levels. I think the [chaplain-in-residence] program is trying to really do that, to address the whole entity of what it means to be an individual.”

A record high of 22 graduates received the prestigious Fulbright award for the 2011-2012 year, the Office of Fellowships announced this week.
The competitive scholarships provide recipients the chance to teach and conduct research abroad. Since they are awarded by individual countries, the last students to receive their awards were not notified until summer. Established in 1946 via legislation introduced by Sen. J. William Fulbright (D-Ark.), the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program awards about 1,100 grants each year.
Georgetown’s strong performance places it among the top recipients of the award nationwide.
“It’s a harvest that’s paying off,” said John Glavin, director of the Office of Fellowships and a professor of English
In 2010, Georgetown students were awarded 16 Fulbrights, and 14 the year before that.
“It is a record, but it is also really important that it is part of a rising trend,” Glavin said.
The scholars will study and teach in 18 different countries on every continent besides Antarctica.
Of the 22 recipients, 16 are students who completed their undergraduate or graduate programs last year, while the rest are recent graduates.
He added that the international orientation of the university makes Georgetown a natural fit for the Fulbright program. In recent years, the office has stepped up efforts to raise awareness of the program and also provide counseling to all applicants.
“The office has made a full-court press,” Glavin said.
Bridget O’Loughlin (SFS 11),  an English Teaching Assistantship Fulbright fellow in Venezuela, said the support she received from the Office of Fellowships and the Dean’s Office in the School of Foreign Service was invaluable.
“I learned about the scholarship from a university email, had numerous members of the university community read my application and write recommendations, and was supported throughout the waiting process,” she wrote in an email.
O’Loughlin added that although students are selected based on projects that they propose, the program is about more than simply research and teaching.
“My taking questions from Venezuelan teenagers for an hour … may not seem like it’s contributing to anything, but it gives both groups the chance to connect in a way they wouldn’t be able to otherwise,” she wrote.
O’Loughlin’s freshman year roommate, Sarah Tucker (SFS ’11), is also a Fulbright recipient conducting education research in Cameroon.
Despite the record, Glavin said he still thinks not enough students are aware of the opportunity.
“Our applicant pool is much smaller than our talent pool,” he said.
He said he hopes to continue the push to encourage more students to apply in the future.

Despite their dropping stock prices, customer dissatisfaction and projected losses, Netflix — the video rental and streaming website popular among college students — is exactly where it wants to be, according to company executives.
“Our long-term streaming opportunity is as compelling as ever, and we are moving forward as quickly as we can to repair our reputation and return to growth,” Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings wrote in a letter to investors. “We continue to be well positioned to succeed in the large global market for streaming video.”
But according to reports released earlier this week,  Netflix lost 800,000 customers between July and October after the company divorced its online streaming and DVD-delivery plans and attempted to divide into two separate companies to manage the different aspects of its business.
Students may not be pleased with the changes, but many are sticking with Netflix anyway.
Take Cheney Williams (COL ’12), for example. Williams dropped her DVD subscription after the division and price hikes, but she kept her online streaming option so that she could keep up with the television shows she enjoys watching through Netflix.
“They have some really great TV shows on there, and they have a deal with Starz that lets you watch all of their shows, too,” she said.
For college students, many of whom do not have cable television, the ability to stream movies and television shows can be a draw. For Anwesha Banerjee (COL ’13) that option alone is enough.
“It’s great to be able to have all the movies online for instant streaming, especially to six different devices per family,” she wrote in an email. “We have each of our laptops, our large TV in the living room and our desktop all hooked up to it.”
With Netflix promising to digitize more and more movies in the future, Banerjee also agrees that the streaming service is likely the future of the company.
“Mainly, I got rid of the DVD part because I’m assuming they’re digitizing DVDs and there will be more and more options available online,” she added.
Like most of her peers, Banerjee does not understand Netflix’s price increases, and she believes that they will have to decrease their prices in order to compete with other rental services like Redbox.
Netflix, however, seems to have the market cornered on instant viewing, a fact that means that they do not have to compete with Redbox as much as it might seem. With a sizable online library, Netflix allows viewers to stay at home and watch movies whenever they want, while Redbox requires viewers to choose from a smaller selection after leaving the house.
“I just can’t be bothered to go get a movie from Redbox,” Ryan O’Donnell (MSB ’13) said. “I just open my computer and watch.”
As for the price increase, O’Donnell looks at it as a kind of necessary evil.
“The price increase was not ideal, obviously, but I think the streaming is pretty solid,” he said.
In his discussion with investors earlier this week, Hastings defended the company’s pricing by touting its content.
“We think that $7.99 per month for streaming is such a great price that we should focus on upping the content,” he said. “We think the future is brightest when focusing on streaming.”
For now, it seems that college students are in agreement, keeping their online streaming accounts despite the price hikes.
“I use Netflix,” O’Donnell said. “I probably use it too much. I wouldn’t drop it.”

President Barack Obama’s announcement of significant changes to student loan repayment plans Wednesday garnered approval from university officials lobbying for student loan reform.
“In a global economy, putting a college education within reach for every American has never been more important, but it’s also never been more expensive,” Obama said in a press release.
This latest move to consolidate student loans and reduce interest rates is part of his administration’s efforts to increase college affordability.
In 2014 the government will implement a “Pay as You Earn” program, limiting monthly loan payments for student borrowers to 10 percent of their discretionary income. The program will also forgive all loans after 20 years, instead of the current practice of  25 years. According to the press release, 1.6 million borrowers will be able to start consolidating their loans in January of 2012.
Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said the university supports student loan reform as a part of its lobbying activities on Capitol Hill.
In a press release, the university said that it sees the “Pay as You Earn” program as a way to help students pursue greater opportunities in the future.
“[This program] may prove especially helpful to graduating students who pursue service programs such as Teach For America, the Peace Corps and Jesuit Refugee Services,” the university’s official comment said.
But Fleming said that few Georgetown students will need loan restructuring. Because of the university’s commitment to providing need-based aid and graduates’ ability to find higher paying jobs, many borrowers pay off their loans promptly.
Georgetown students’ default rate is 0.8 percent, compared to the national private college rate of 4.6 percent.
Ryan Zimmerman (COL ’12), who receives financial aid from Georgetown, said that government assistance would help lessen the pressure of paying back loans.
“With student loans that will need to be paid sooner rather than later, consolidating my debt at a lower interest rate in a pay-as-you-go program is obviously something that will lessen my financial strain,” he said. “It’s stressful enough to try to find a job when there are no jobs to be had, but to be in any amount of debt while being unemployed is a restrictive burden on anyone entering the real world.”
