Bryan Kasper, assistant dean in the School of Foreign Service, will leave the university for a position in the U.S. State Department at the end of the semester, according to an email sent to SFS undergraduates by Associate Dean and SFS Director Mitch Kaneda.
Kasper is a first year student advisor and curricular dean for International Politics major. He has been at Georgetown since 1998, and has spent the last six and a half years with the SFS. Kasper previously worked in the Office of Student Affairs, Housing and Conference Services and the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.
Kasper represents the SFS on the university’s Bias Reporting Team, the Overseas Study Advisory Committee, the Student Conduct Judicial Hearing Board and the University Honor Council.
“We will miss Dean Kasper greatly, but at the same time wish him for the very best as he pursues his professional interest in the U.S. Government,” Kaneda wrote in the email.
The SFS Dean’s Office will be appointing an interim dean to take over Kasper’s duties as he transitions out of his role, according to Kaneda.

Members of GUSA’s Finance and Appropriations committee finalized a proposal Wednesday that allocates funds from the Student Activities Fund Endowment to the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, Georgetown Energy and the New South Student Center renovation effort.
The Georgetown University Student Association senate will vote on the document Sunday. If it passes, students will vote on the proposal in a referendum from Jan. 24 to Jan. 26.
In marathon meetings held Tuesday and Wednesday, Fin/App reviewed endowment proposals submitted by the three student groups. The committee voted unanimously to allocate $1.25 million to the SIPS Fund, $250,000 to Georgetown Energy’s initiative to install solar panels on the roofs of university townhouses, and $1.6 million to the construction of an outdoor terrace on the south side of the New South Student Center.
The Healy Pub proposal, originally a primary recommendation of the commission set up to review all ideas, was deemed infeasible.
The remaining $450,000 of the $3.57 million endowment was allocated for the renovation of theNSSC’s first level. Because this construction is projected to cost more than $600,000, the remainder of the construction costs for the first level will be paid using interest gained on the endowment. Interest gained after the renovation costs are met will be given to the SIPS Fund, should it be passed in the referendum.
Proponents of the New South renovation project also requested funding for three fireplaces and a skylight, which the Finance and Appropriations Committee elected not to provide.
Senator Zach Singer (SFS ‘15) argued that, of the three projects, the New South Student Center would make the most tangible difference for Georgetown students.
“I see NSSC as an opportunity too good to pass up, and too good to shortchange,” he said.
But in Tuesday’s meeting, SIPS fund co-founder Nick Troiano (COL ’12), criticized the New South Student Center’s proposal, questioning its long-term impact and influence outside of the university.
“Anyone can think of ways to make their own lives marginally better. How do we use our own potential to make a difference?” Troiano said.
Troiano said that he was ultimately satisfied with the funding that the committee allocated to the SIPS fund, which plans to use its endowment money to support student service projects, in the proposal.
Georgetown Energy initially requested funding for solar panel additions to the roofs of 43 townhouses, but revised its request when it determined that some roofs might not be able to physically support the instillation. Fin/App’s plan would allocate funding for all 43 townhouses, while money that is not spent by May 2012 will be placed in Georgetown Energy’s Green Revolving Loan Fund. The GRLF will be managed by the SIPS Fund and fund future student-run green energy projects.
Georgetown Energy’s proposal aroused controversy Tuesday when Senator Daniel LaMagna (COL ‘13) announced that two of his constituents, Tyler Eldridge (COL ’13) and Evan Abrams (SFS ’12), claimed that Georgetown Energy had pilfered concepts from their own plans for a revolving sustainability loan fund, which would be facilitated by a student group called “The Fund.”
In Tuesday’s meeting, members of Georgetown Energy refuted the accusations, pointing to the existence of approximately 170 similar green funds at other institutions. The group also claimed to have several emails proving that the fund was discussed before Georgetown Energy was aware of The Fund. Finance and Appropriations Chair Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) said that the accusations were a separate issue from the meeting’s student activity endowment allocation discussion.
Abrams declined to comment because of continuing discussions between The Fund and Georgetown Energy. Members of Georgetown Energy declined to be interviewed for similar reasons.
In Wednesday’s meeting, Malkerson said that the two groups had come to a mutual agreement and will submit a joint letter of recommendation to the SIPS Fund on how to best implement the GRLF.
“Both sides are happy,” he said.

More than $200 in cash was stolen from a Vital Vittles office at 1:08 p.m. Thursday, according to The Corp’s Chief Executive Officer Alexander Pon (COL ’12).
Pon said that employees noticed a man entering the convenience store’s back office and fleeing with the cash. The suspect pushed a Vittles employee out of the way as he left the store. Employees followed the man to his car, which was parked outside the Leavey Center but were unable to apprehend him. The Department of Public Safety and the Metropolitan Police Department responded to the incident and are managing the ongoing investigation.
According to Pon, the money had been left unsecured for 30 seconds while a manager was on his way to count it.
“It was in that intermediate time the suspect entered our back office area,” he said.
A DPS public safety alert emailed to the campus community at 7:40 p.m. Thursday stated that $600 had been taken from the store, a number which Pon said was incorrect.
“I know for a fact … the number in the PSA is wrong,” he said.
The PSA identified the suspect as a light-skinned black male about 5-foot-8 in height and wearing blue jeans and a gray sweatshirt. His car was described as a black SUV.
The Corp Chief Operating Officer Brooke Heinichen (SFS ’12) did not believe that the man was affiliated with The Corp.
“It was not anyone that we recognized,” she said.
Pon added that the suspect did not appear to be of college age.
According to Heinichen, the man’s image was captured by the convenience store’s security cameras, which were installed in Corp locations in the past few weeks as part of routine safety improvements.
“We were able to review tapes and provide DPS with significantly more information than we would have been able to without the cameras,” she said. She added that the employees were also able to note the license plate on the suspect’s car.
Representatives of DPS could not be reached for comment at press time.
