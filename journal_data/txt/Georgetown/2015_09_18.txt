After more than two months of negotiations between student activists and the university, the Georgetown University Student Association and administrators agreed upon policy reforms regarding campus sexual assault in a memorandum of understanding released Monday.
In the six-point memorandum, GUSA and administrators agreed to increase bystander education programs, expand marketing campaigns for campus resources for survivors, collect information about the university climate regarding sexual assault and expedite the hiring of a full-time Title IX coordinator.
The memorandum was the result of three meetings held in the past two months between GUSA, student activists and the administration, marking a milestone in the ongoing student-led movement calling for the university to re-evaluate its resources and policies.
GUSA Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) said he is satisfied with the progress they have made with the administration on the issue.
“We are thrilled that we can play a role in making Georgetown a more survivor-centric community,” Rohan said. “We only had two serious things on our platform when we were running, and one of them was sexual assault, so it’s good to see concrete progress in that.”
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, who participated in the negotiations and signed the memorandum on behalf of the university, said that he was content with the outcome of the memorandum.
“I am enthused about the collaborative work with students that led to this MOU,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am very grateful to everyone involved for their commitment and care around these vital issues.”
Olson also said the university will be sure to stay committed to the agreements made in the MOU.
“We are publicly signing this MOU, and thus saying to the campus community that we will take these actions,” Olson wrote. “We are committed to following through on each of the commitments.”
The MOU details responsibilities for both GUSA and the administration to meet the shared objectives, with specific deadlines set for many of the commitments.
Both parties will engage with Health Education Services, the Women’s Center and other offices to develop an ongoing, comprehensive and far-reaching bystander education program, which will be implemented by next March.
Students and administrators have also agreed to improve the quality and quantity of marketing channels for survivor resources, including a redesign of the university’s sexual assault website and the placement of resource contact information on the back of GOCards, starting with these of the Class of 2020.
The university will also conduct a thorough campus climate survey by mid-January 2016. The CCS is a common instrument used by universities to comprehend incidents of and attitudes toward sexual violence on their campus.
The university will also move forward with its plan to hire a full-time Title IX coordinator, which began over a year ago. The administration will extend interview dates to final candidates by the end of the month. The role is currently filled by Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny, who is assisted by several deputy coordinators.
Kilkenny did not reply to a request for comment on the MOU.
In addition to the above specific commitments, both GUSA and administrators will continue to evaluate existing policies, with biweekly meetings scheduled between the two parties.
Rohan said GUSA will continue to seek student input throughout the process.
“As we created this memorandum, we consulted with a bunch of students from a bunch of organizations and a lot of survivors of sexual assault. As we move forward, we’re still going to engage with these groups and individuals,” Rohan said.
GUSA Secretary of Student Safety Maddy Moore (SFS ’17) said that although GUSA and the administration shared mutual interests, the two parties were not able to immediately agree on the issue of covering financial costs for survivors.
“Something that was left out of the conversation on the MOU … is the ongoing discussion about absorbing survivors’ financial costs due to their experiences, which would include some type of housing accommodation, medical accommodation and [coverage of] paperwork fees,” Moore said. “That’s something we definitely want to push for.”
GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) said that GUSA will prioritize this concern as dialogue with the university continues.
“That’s one of the first things we’ll be talking about,” Luther said. “That has big financial implications, so we have to find out what’s reasonable and what’s required and how we can make this the most survivor-centric.”
The initial conversation between GUSA and the administration was scheduled in mid-July, after an opinion piece in The Hoya co-authored by Zoe Dobkin (SFS ’16) and Willa Murphy (“I Stand With Willa, I Stand With Survivors,” thehoya.com, July 21, 2015) was widely shared across the university community. The piece, which detailed Murphy’s experience with the university and subsequent expulsion following her rape, ignited dialogue about sexual assault at Georgetown.
The movement gained further momentum when Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17), another survivor of sexual assault, shared her experiences in a viewpoint published in The Hoya (“A Shared Obligation,” thehoya.com, July 29, 2015).
In less than a month following the publication of the first opinion piece, students met with administrators Aug. 10 to discuss policy reform.
Hinerfeld said that she hopes the MOU will cause students and administrators to take concrete action against sexual assault.
“I hope that students will see the number of different changes Georgetown is committed to enacting, and I hope that through these changes, students will see tangible ways to get involved,” Hinerfeld wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Hinerfeld also said that she was optimistic about the continued efforts of students and administrators to improve the environment for survivors on campus.
“The negotiations these past few weeks have made it more clear to me than ever before that the administrators in these meetings care deeply about serving students,” Hinerfeld wrote. “Through continued collaboration, the administration, GUSA and student activists will hold each other accountable and follow through on our obligations.”
In light of the tangible agreements made by GUSA and the administration, Moore said it is important for the community to continue its involvement in the issue.
“It’s an important step, but it’s important to clarify that it’s a continuation of the activism that’s been happening on campus for the last decade,” Moore said. “We want to keep the conversation going, and that’s going to take a lot of work.”

While this positive step on sexual assault is to be commended, we are still lacking when it comes to sexual education and convenient access to birth control on this campus. Birth control should be as easy to access as alcohol for our students.  And right now it’s far easier to get alcohol than to any sort of protection.

You’d have to be living in a cave to not get access to birth control on this campus

King Felipe VI (GRD ’95) and Queen Letizia of Spain visited the university Wednesday to launch a three-day campus conference with Spanish scientists, attending both the first meeting of the conference in Riggs Library and celebratory dinner in their honor on Copley Lawn.
The panel discussion in Riggs Library, primarily conducted in Spanish, touched upon the main themes of the conference, including biomedical research, energy, engineering, technology, economics and the social sciences.
University President John J. DeGioia introduced the king, queen and Spanish scientists at the meeting, thanking them all for their respective contributions to the conference.
“We’re deeply honored for this opportunity to host you and to help create a forum for discussion, reflection and for the sharing of discoveries in your various fields of research through the conference that will take place here in the days ahead,” DeGioia said. “We are extraordinarily grateful for their presence here today, and look forward to hearing from His Majesty, an extraordinary global leader and Georgetown alumnus, later in this program.”
King Felipe graduated with a master’s in foreign service from the School of Foreign Service and continued his involvement in the university community after graduation with contributions to the Georgetown Leadership Seminar.
The prince was an active part of the student community and even enjoyed playing squash at Yates Field House, according to a 2014 article published by the university.
Shortly before ascending to the throne in the summer of 2014, he created and served as chair of a Georgetown Global Forum in Madrid called “Momento España.”
Although much of King Felipe’s speech at the meeting was in Spanish, he concluded in English, thanking the university and alluding to his time as a graduate student.
“This institution is really close to my heart. As you know, it contributed to my personal and intellectual education in such a way that I will always be grateful and honored,” the king said. “Today the queen and I would also like to show our deep appreciation of the warm welcome you offered us … and for opening your doors to our delegation, to this group of Spanish scientists who are wonderful ambassadors for the talent and innovation from Spain.”
Following the discussion in Riggs Library, the king and queen left Healy Hall and greeted members of the Georgetown community on their walk to dinner, held in an enclosed tent on Copley Lawn.
In addition to DeGioia, several other faculty members, including SFS Dean Joel Hellman, attended Wednesday’s festivities.
BMW Center for German and European Studies Director Jeffery Anderson met the king and queen at the dinner.
“I use the terms ‘pride’ and ‘joy.’ It was a joyful event on both sides,” Anderson said. “We’re obviously very proud of all that he’s accomplished, and at the same time, one could tell that he was very happy to be back. I’ve heard from many people who are close to the king how much he remembers fondly his Georgetown experience and how much he enjoys returning, and so you could see that on his face and on the queen’s face.”
Anderson added that he is optimistic about the future of scientific collaboration between Spain and the United States, given the success of the King Felipe’s visit.
“It’s hard to say what will come out of it, but there’s obviously a huge amount of goodwill and it’s building on very established relationships, both within the United States and across the Atlantic with Spain, so this can only further help the development of this important area for both the United States and Spain, but also for Georgetown too,” Anderson said. “It was great to see Georgetown on the map for this important initiative.”
Georgetown University Police Department officers were stationed around the front lawns throughout the evening and closed off all walkways in front of Copley and Healy Halls as the king and queen made their way to dinner. The police team allowed the first community members who lined up to stop and take pictures with the royals.
GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said the department worked alongside the Secret Service to ensure the event was safe.
“We do a lot of walkthroughs with the office of protocols here at the university and with the organization that’s protecting that particular person, and in this case it was the Secret Service,” Gruber said.
He added that there were no security issues, and described the evening as a success.
“I think it was a very successful event. I think it was a wonderful event for the university that went off on our end without a hitch,” Gruber said.
King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia also toured Mount Vernon and the White House earlier in the week, as part of their first official visit to the United States.

A magnitude 8.3 earthquake struck the coast of Chile on Sept. 16, killing at least 11 and prompting the evacuation of more than one million people. Eleven Georgetown students, all uninjured, are currently studying abroad in Santiago and Valparaiso.
Office of Global Education Director Craig Rinker worked with the Council on International Educational Exchange, a nonprofit that manages international study abroad and exchange programs, to make sure all the students studying abroad were unharmed. Students were contacted through local CIEE point persons and directly by email.
“I am happy to report that all Georgetown students studying in Chile (in Santiago and Valparaiso) are safe,” Rinker wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our office worked with our program partner, CIEE, to confirm that all students are fine. The Office of Global Education has also reached out to the Georgetown students directly, to offer any support or additional services as needed.”
Madeline Sposato (SFS ’17) and Sophia Wood (SFS ’17) are currently studying in Santiago, 145 miles away from the epicenter.
“In all honesty, I realized we were shaking but didn’t realize it was that large a quake until I saw Chileans running towards the escalators in a panic,” Sposato wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We’ve been notifying our families and friends back home on our status and those of other fellow Georgetown students with whom we’ve been in contact. We’ve made a point to look out for our friends in the program.”
Wood added that they were never threatened by tsunami warnings, which were issued closer to the earthquake’s epicenter.
“We were having tea when his grandma came in to tell us there was a tremor, which was about when I started to feel it,” Wood added. “We are far from the water here, so the tsunami warnings were not applicable to us; we just made sure that everyone we knew was safe.”
Matt Raab (SFS ’17) is studying abroad in Santiago, and said that the earthquake was stronger than usual (full disclosure: Raab is a staff writer for The Hoya).
“We get small earthquakes that Chileans refer to as temblors all the time,” Raab wrote in an email. “But then it kept getting stronger, things started to shake, and my host family started to look a little disconcerted.”
Raab highlighted Georgetown’s rapid response to the situation through both the CIEE and the Office of Global Education.
“Georgetown support has been great,” Raab wrote. “The CIEE program here in Santiago has plenty of planning in place for earthquakes like these, which aren’t extremely uncommon here. The Office of Global Education has reached out to us to make sure we’re all okay, and I feel like I have all the support I could need. Things are going back to normal here, and people are moving on for the most part.”
Hoya Staff Writer Katherine Richardson contributed reporting.

For more than two decades, churchgoers at Dahlgren Chapel have prayed under an iron cross that accompanied the voyage of the first settlers from England to Maryland in 1634. When Pope Francis conducts his first service at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception next Wednesday, the same cross will hang on the altar above him, in view of thousands of worshippers.
Since it was first discovered in the university’s archives in 1989, the 4-foot tall cross has served as an iconic symbol of not only Georgetown’s Jesuit tradition, but also the expansion of the Catholic faith in America.
Fr. G. Ronald Murphy, S.J., who was responsible for the discovery of the cross, said that the use of the cross at the papal mass is significant, particularly because it was used in the first Catholic mass in an English-speaking colony in the Americas.
“The most important artifact that we can lay out for [Pope Francis’] appreciation is this cross,” Murphy said. “The cross is a symbol of both Catholicism and religious liberty at the same time.”
The Archdiocese of Washington first issued a request for the cross to be featured on the altar of the basilica during the organization of the papal mass.
Director of Music, Liturgy and Catholic Life Jim Wickman delivered the cross to the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception last Thursday in preparation for the pope’s mass.
Wickman said that the cross signifies a connection between Georgetown, the oldest Jesuit university in the country, and Pope Francis, the first Jesuit pope in history.
“In a sense, having the Dahlgren Chapel cross at this mass is having a piece of Georgetown at the mass with the Holy Father, and that is so important to us as the oldest Jesuit and Catholic university in the U.S.,” Wickman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Wickman also chose three students who regularly attended mass at Dahlgren Chapel, Spencer Crawford (SFS ’16), Caroline Musslewhite (COL ’16) and Francesca Vullo (COL ’16), to accompany him during the delivery. The three students wrapped the cross in a blanket and carried it onto a car that took them to the basilica.
Crawford said that the cross is a symbol of the university’s interreligious values.
“When I see the cross at the mass that Pope Francis will be celebrating, I’ll think of my Hindu friends, my Muslim friends and my Catholic friends at Georgetown, and how Georgetown really fosters interreligious dialogue in our personal, spiritual lives,” Crawford said.
The cross made its journey to America in 1634 onboard the Ark and the Dove, two ships that carried primarily Catholics to Maryland from England, where Catholics were being persecuted at the time.
Murphy also noted that the Ark and the Dove carried many Protestant passengers, making the cross a symbol of tolerance between the two religions.
“The boats were filled with a mixed population of Catholics and Protestants,” Murphy said. “[The cross] stands for the voyagers’ commitment to the Catholic faith despite persecution in England, and also that ‘we will be respectful for other people of other faiths.’”
According to Murphy, it was likely that the cross was made with iron on the voyage. Musslewhite said that the simple construction of the cross relates to Pope Francis’ messages.
“It was a way to use what they had in front of them, even if it was pretty simple, to remind themselves of God’s presence in their lives, of goodness, of love and of sacrifice,” Musslewhite wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This fits exactly with the Pope’s message for greater unity among all people and respect for the dignity of all.”
In addition to the cross, the pilgrims also carried eight cannons, two of which were given to the university and placed outside of Healy Hall in 1888.
When the settlers arrived, the cross was used to mark a building, likely a school attached to a priest house, as Christian. Eventually, the cross was brought to Georgetown, though the identity of its deliverer remains a mystery. The cross sat in storage for years until Murphy rediscovered it.
Murphy recalled that his discovery of the cross began when he was driving from New Jersey to Georgetown in 1989. When he stopped by St. Francis Xavier Church by the Eastern Shore route, he saw a replica of an iron cross, with an inscription indicating that the original cross was at Georgetown.
“I was so shocked. At the time, I was a director at Georgetown and I said, ‘I know nothing about this. I’ve never heard of a cross that came from the original spot,’” Murphy said.
When he returned to Georgetown, Murphy contacted the university archivist and was directed to a storage space in the south tower of Healy Hall.
Murphy said that his discovery of the cross in the room was almost accidental.
“I looked over to the right and there were swords, sabers and more muskets, and I thought, ‘I want to go over there and see that stuff.’ As I was walking over, I almost tripped and fell because on the floor, on a wooden pallet, was an iron cross. I knew right away when I looked at it that this was it,” Murphy said.
Following its rediscovery, the cross was installed in Dahlgren Chapel as part of the university’s bicentennial celebration.
Murphy said that the Pope’s message aligns with Georgetown’s mission.
“The passengers [on the Ark and the Dove] were extremely tolerant and appreciative of each other, and that made its way years later into the prospectus of Georgetown, which says that we’ll gladly admit students of other faiths,” Murphy said.

Students in the College and the School of Foreign Service recently received an email invitation to complete the first 2015 Hoya Values Survey, which seeks to compare and analyze the values and beliefs of students on both the D.C. and SFS-Qatar campuses.
The results of the survey will be used to track how students’ values shift during their academic careers at Georgetown, as well as to compare the responses between year levels and the two campuses.
Associate Professor George Shambaugh, who conducted research and developed questions for the survey alongside Daniel Stoll, senior advisor to the dean of the SFS-Q, said he is curious to explore the impact of a Jesuit education on student values .
“It’s really just a curious question, which is threefold. How do people’s attitudes and beliefs change as they go through an undergraduate education, and, in particular, what does that look like if you go through a Jesuit university or an American university?” Shambaugh said.
Shambaugh said he is fascinated by the process by which Jesuit values are integrated into students’ values and beliefs.
“One would hope that as you go through an education at a Jesuit university, you absorb or adapt those values over time or come to a better understanding of what those values mean,” Shambaugh said. “How that will manifest itself, we’ll find out.”
The survey will be distributed to students by email over the next four years. Students who take the survey are assigned a random number that will identify them on future surveys, allowing researchers to track how an individual’s responses have shifted over time. The respondents’ names will remain anonymous.
According to Shambaugh, the exclusion of students in the School of Nursing and Health Studies and McDonough School of Business students will help researchers better compare the SFS in D.C. to SFS-Q.
The majority of the questions for the survey are based on questions included in the World Values Survey, a questionnaire administered by an international group of social scientists to respondents around the world over the last 20 years. The WVS has been circulated throughout approximately 100 countries.
Shambaugh said that the survey will explore the effects of a Georgetown education on students, but will also examine how cultural and societal shifts change perceptions of topics such as the government’s role in the economy, abortion and LGBTQ issues.
“What [this] means is that we can compare these things about Georgetown with the general population,” Shambaugh said. “Are [students] more or less open to the sort of cultural and social changes that are affecting the U.S. and world or the Catholic Church more broadly? To me, it’s a really curious question.”
Some of the questions on the survey are more Georgetown-specific, as part of the researchers’ efforts to track how uniquely Georgetown experiences might shape a student’s development over four years.
These include questions about how a student may have been influenced by classes taught by a Jesuit priest, engagement in public outreach programs and study abroad experiences.
“These are all things we assume … have an influence or impact, but it hasn’t really been tracked, not at Georgetown nor more broadly in the U.S. educational system,” Shambaugh said.
The survey also tests the knowledge of respondents on the history of international affairs, including a question that asks survey-takers what the Washington Consensus is.
Shambaugh also acknowledged that the survey may contain biases due to the fact that students self-select to participate, but said that there are certain ways of correcting for that selection bias.
“We know what the student population looks like in terms of gender, race and religion, so we can weigh the responses based on those characteristics so the sample we’re analyzing is weighted to reflect the population of the student body,” Shambaugh said.
Shambaugh said that he believes the survey is a unique opportunity for students to share their beliefs.
“I think the ability to compare yourself to your peers is really kind of interesting,” Shambaugh said. “It’s a fun opportunity and I encourage everybody whose thinking about it but hasn’t participated to do so.”
Lydia Bubniak (SFS ’18), who participated in the survey, said that she found taking the survey to be a thought-provoking experience.
“For a few questions, I really had to stop and think about “Okay, what do I think I’m supposed to say versus what I actually feel,’” Bubniak said. “The fact is that not everyone has the same cultural values.”
However, Bubniak was also critical of the simplicity of some parts of the survey.
“There were some things I wanted to explain and some questions where the answers weren’t completely black or white. … In some ways the survey was a little too simplistic.”
Grace Smith (COL ’18), another participant in the survey, said that it pushed her to think of other cultural perspectives.
“I appreciated having the opportunity to voice my opinion. Some questions seemed so straightforward, and the answer seems incredibly clear, but the survey also acted as a nice reminder that we all fall on a spectrum in terms of our beliefs and that there are other valid opinions out there,” Smith said.

Philosophy professor Nancy Sherman presented her new book on post-bellum effects on veterans called “Afterwar: Healing the Moral Wounds of Our Soldiers,” Wednesday at an event hosted by the Mortara Center for International Studies.
The event consisted of a conversation between Sherman and Mortara Center Director Kathleen McNamara, who spoke at the launch of her own book, “The Politics of Everyday Europe,” last week. Sherman’s launch was followed by a question-and-answer session with attendees.
McNamara began the hour-long event by introducing Sherman and her diverse background, which spans a wide range of academic disciplines such as psychoanalysis and ethics. McNamara also said that Sherman’s professional experiences, which includes visiting Guantanamo Bay Detention Center as part of an independent observation team, makes her uniquely qualified to write a book focused on the morality and psychology of veterans.
In addition to her vast academic background, McNamara also mentioned Sherman’s previous critically-acclaimed works, including “The Untold War: Inside the Hearts, Minds, and Souls of our Soldiers and Stoic Warriors,” which acted as a strong foundation in military ethics that allowed her to write “Afterwar.”
Sherman said she wrote “Afterwar” in response to her personal inquiry into understanding soldiers’ moral perspectives after returning to civilian life. In her discussion, Sherman said she was inspired to write the book after teaching veterans at Georgetown.
“I wanted to do something a little more post-bellum, partly because of my setting here at Georgetown. I was teaching a lot of veterans … and they were coming and feeling very alienated, so I had this sense that I wanted to talk to them,” Sherman said.
Sherman then spoke to the importance of addressing veterans when they return from service from a moral perspective, recognizing the stigma that mental health issues hold within the U.S. health system.
“[Veterans] are in quiet ways … feeling a lot of anguish, not quite knowing how to say it, not knowing how to begin the conversation, in a country that nationally has an epidemic of mental health issues and a stigma surrounding it,” Sherman said.
Sherman also detailed specific case studies she used in her research for “Afterwar,” including an account from Navy seaman Alysha Haran who experienced sexism and depression while serving on a Navy destroyer.
Sherman said that veterans often feel unable to engage with civilians on mental health issues due to societal distance placed between the “war and the warrior.”
“People were coming home struggling with the stigma of mental health, and not knowing how to begin conversations in a country that learned to separate the war from the warrior. We’ve got, the ‘Vietnam Hangover’ … and one of the ways to politely separate the war from the warrior is to say ‘thank you for your service’ without doing anything,” Sherman said.
Lastly, Sherman suggested policy proposals that may help ease veterans back into civilian life. Specifically, she stressed the importance of across-the-board mental health reform in the United States, coupled with more extensive follow-up with service members after returning home.
Brittany Fried (SFS ’19), who attended the event, said she thoroughly enjoyed the intimate setting of the event and its conversational nature.
“I thought it was very engaging. It was really nice to have the personal stories and so much time for question-and-answer. I thought the conversation setting was very well done,” Fried said.
Santul Nerkar (COL ’19) said he learned about the importance of showing appreciation and care for veterans returning from service.
“I think there needs to be a better education of us, and we need more of an accepting role, more of a responsibility of this war and of soldiers that come back. That’s where the real patriotism lies, not in the war itself, but in the response afterwards,” Nerkar said.
Fried said the event helped her understand the role civilians can play in helping to facilitate the recuperation of veterans.
“I very much agree that a lot of [the solution] lays in education, and although we may not be able to completely emphasize because we haven’t been through the situation ourselves,” Fried said. “It’s important to be able to understand potential war wounds and how we can be a large part of helping them to recuperate and become a part of society again.”

Georgetown University Medical Center Memory Disorders Program Director Scott Turner worked as the principal investigator in the largest ever nationwide clinical trial of an Alzheimer’s disease drug called Resveratrol.
Turner’s research found that a biomarker involved in the progression of the disease stabilized when patients received a purified form of resveratrol, a compound found in high levels in red wine, red grapes, red wine juice, chocolate and tomatoes.
GUMC Executive Dean Edward Healton said Turner’s leadership helped make the trial a success.
“Dr. Turner conceived and designed this clinical trial,” Healton said. “To see it come to fruition with a promising path forward speaks to the leadership he brings to Georgetown. The Memory Disorders Program Dr. Turner directs is one of the most robust clinical trials programs in the Washington area and one of the largest in the country.” 
In the United States, five million people currently have Alzheimer’s disease. According to Turner, this number is expected to double by 2050 due to increased life expectancy and population growth.
The study, which ran from 2012 to 2014, included 119 participants and 26 medical centers across the country.
Half of the participants took a placebo capsule that looked identical to the original resveratrol drug, while the other half took the drug itself. Additionally, the study was double blind, meaning neither patients nor clinical staff were aware of who was receiving the resveratrol capsules and who was receiving the placebo capsules.
For one year, participants regularly took the oral capsules. The dose increased every three months, and by the end, individuals were taking one gram of resveratrol twice daily — a dose equivalent to the amount of the compound found in 1,000 bottles of red wine.
The trial results demonstrated that a protein called amyloid-beta40 was stabilized in individuals who took resveratrol. Normally, these proteins would be depleted due to dementia. In addition, research found that resveratrol penetrated the blood-brain barrier.
Turner commented on the results of the trial and highlighted patient reaction to the high doses of resveratrol.
“We proved that high doses of resveratrol were safe and well-tolerated in older individuals with Alzheimer’s disease,” Turner said. “The major side effect was weight loss of about two pounds over 12 months in the resveratrol-treated group.”
However, Turner also noted that definite conclusions about resveratrol intake and its relationship to delaying dementia cannot be drawn solely from the study.
“We cannot conclude from this study that resveratrol is beneficial — a larger Phase 3 trial will address that question,” Turner said. “We are not recommending resveratrol supplements or consuming more than one glass of red wine daily. However, several studies have shown that a Mediterranean diet may delay the onset of dementia.”
John Bozza, one of the patients in the study, was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and then mild Alzheimer’s a year later. He and his wife Diana Bozza decided to participate in the study.
“I definitely want the medical community to find a cure,” Bozza said in a GUMC press release. “And of course I thought there’s always a chance that John could have been helped, and who knows, maybe he was.”
Turner said the study is a step toward discovering new and more effective treatments of Alzheimer’s disease.
“We have many studies in progress testing new treatments for Alzheimer’s,” Turner said. “Most of these are focused directly on blocking amyloid production or promoting its clearance. Finding more effective treatments is critical when you consider the size of our aging baby boomer population.”

The Washington Post President and General Manager Stephen Hills announced he will leave his post to assume a new position as founding director of the Georgetown University Law Center’s Business Skills Program, effective in January.
GULC Dean William Treanor said the new program will broaden the range of educational opportunities its students receive.
“One of the things that emerged from it is that we should be teaching students a broader range of competencies than just teaching them how to think like a lawyer,” Treanor said.
“We should be teaching them to understand accounting and finance. We should teach them project management. We should teach them a broader range of skills than is traditional of law school.”
Hills will work with law school faculty to develop a curriculum for the program, which will focus on teaching law students about the business sector, project management and organization. Any student enrolled in the law school is eligible to participate in January.
“It’s really about trying to understand what business is really like, not just taking a full course in accounting or a full course in mergers and acquisitions,” Hills said. “A survey course, an overview of this, [will] try to prepare law students for either a career in business, a career in business law or to be a lawyer running a firm and to deal with actually managing a business.”
Hills added that experiences from his 28-year tenure at The Washington Post have influenced the broader themes of the new program.
“There are lessons across the board in every discipline that can be learned about leadership, about innovation, about marketing, about finance organizational structure and behavior that, in the course of my Washington Post career, I really got to draw on,” Hills said.
Professors Peter Byrne, Naomi Mezey, Anna Gelpern, Jeff Bowman, Don Langevoort and Bob Thompson have been working with Hills throughout the development of the program.
Gelpern said the program aligns with Georgetown’s goal of preparing law students for a range of opportunities in the legal field.
“We’re not preparing folks with a particular set of skills for a limited set of occupations,” Gelpern said.
“We’re really preparing folks for leadership positions and a wide range of possibilities, and I think today it is especially important given the evolution of the legal marketplace. … Training in entrepreneurship is immensely important in any number of jobs.”
Gelpern added that she is hopeful the program will teach a mix of entrepreneurial skills with an experiential and practical focus.
“My hope for the program is that it is not just advanced business — that to me would not be the right way to use this opportunity,” Gelpern said. “I think it’s a way to take entrepreneurial skills broadly defined and combine them with the public-spiritedness of our institution, the policy focus, as well as our strength in business, finance and regulation.”
Treanor said GULC is also looking to add courses to the business skills curriculum as the program expands in addition to previous initiatives, such as offering a financial literacy boot camp taught by the McDonough School of Business faculty members and externship short courses.
“I think we’ll have more courses such as project management, organizational behavior, strategic planning that are offered at the law school,” Treanor said. “We’ll be thinking through how to take what are traditionally business school courses and adapting them for law students.”
Treanor added that the program may also prepare students for careers specifically in business law.
“It’s an innovative program; it’s not something that you see at other law schools,” Treanor said. “At a time of challenge in the legal profession, we think it responds to the needs that we have to prepare our students for their professional careers, so I could not be more excited about this program.”
Hills also said he is looking forward to his new career as a professor, which will allow him to interact with Georgetown students.
“I’m very excited. I think that Georgetown has got some of the best and brightest law students in the country, and so the idea to be able to spend time with people of that caliber is really exciting,” Hills said.
“A lot of what I’m going to hope for and look forward to is actually having the students teach each other because that to me is the best: a lot of participation, a lot of case study work, very few lectures.”

“The World We Want,” a public community art movement that originated in Brooklyn, N.Y., is launching hundreds of new projects around the world this month, including one on 11th Street NE and another on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue in Washington, D.C. Sept. 18.
Participants write on chalkboard-like walls that display two prompts, reading, “I want to live in a world where…,” and “To create this world, I will.…”
New York artist Amber Rae created the first project in September 2014. One year later, this September marks the World We Want Month, with the opening of hundreds of new art installations. One wall in D.C. will be located east of the Potomac, in an under-resourced area with lower-income residents, many of whom have been removed from their homes as a result of rising prices. Local business Frager’s Hardware donated all of the materials required for the wall.
Think Local First, an organization that aims to represent the local business community and increase sustainable economic development, is one of the hosts, or “makers,” of the D.C. wall. Makers take a pledge to celebrate their commitment to bring their communities together and their attempt to lead by example through conscious action.
Think Local First Director Omeed Tabiei described the connection that the wall has established between D.C. communities on opposite sides of the Potomac, which are typically different in terms of income and lifestyle.
“As someone who lives west of the river, I have not heard of the community at large until I actually brought this project before their community and have gotten to know a number of people there,” Tabiei said. “I’m very thankful for that, because I’ve gotten a firsthand understanding of that community. … I don’t say that as the hero that’s going to be connecting these two communities, but that is ultimately what the goal of the project is.”
WithLoveDC, a movement that seeks to deepen community connections through events such as yoga and group projects, is also a host. Director and founder of WithLoveDC Heather Markowitz additionally highlighted the positive impact the wall will have on the D.C. community.
“It’s a platform for people to express their dreams and goals and ideals for the world that they want to live in, and also reflect on how they are a part of that change,” Markowitz said. “And how it’s one thing to wish for a better world, but another to stand back and recognize your place in it, and know that you’re also responsible for making the world a better place.”
Project Propel, the third host of the wall, is a startup company based in D.C. that facilitates programs for disadvantaged people in Manila, Philippines. One of its main projects is creating urban gardens and running health modules with community members. Project Propel Director Roberta Plantak stressed the importance of creating honest candid environments so a community can progress. She said this is especially applicable to a city like D.C., where issues of race, politics and socio-economic status arise everyday.
“This is going to create dialogue,” Plantak said. “D.C. is very overlooked in that regard. I really value community dialogue . … Each one of these gardens can feed, and provide a financial/job opportunity forh modules with commmembes all around. …We feel that this is a beautiful way to bring the residents of D.C. together to share their goals and visions for a better world, and to reflect on what each of us can do to take the steps closer to make these dreams a reality.”
After the walls open in D.C., any community members may sign it.

The university is moving forward with plans to reroute four of the five Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle bus lines by late October, which has sparked negative responses from bus commuters.
The rerouting plans were initiated by the Office of Planning and Facilities Management following the announcement of the 2010 Campus Plan, which included neighborhood input to minimize the use of residential streets in bus routes.
With the exception of the Wisconsin Avenue route, the new bus lines will exit campus via Canal Road.
The campus bus stops for these buses will also move to the front of McDonough Gymnasium, as opposed to the current bus stops on the north side of campus that leave via Reservoir Road for the Dupont Circle line and Prospect Street for the Rosslyn, Arlington and Law Center routes.
According to Vice President of Planning and Facilities Robin Morey, the buses will pass through fewer residential areas of the neighborhood with the new routes.
“What it’s trying to accomplish is keeping the buses out of the neighborhoods,” Morey said.  “You can imagine you have these narrow Georgetown streets and these diesel buses driving down, so it’s very disruptive to the homeowners that live there.”
The university has run tests to determine how the altered routes will affect transit times, though the precise changes are hard to determine.
“It remains to be seen,” Morey said.  “Some routes will save five or six minutes in the morning, and in the evening during peak time, we expect it could be ten minutes longer.”
A bus turnaround will be constructed in front of McDonough Arena that will enable buses to come in and out via Canal Road without having to drive across the main campus.  In December, the university will also construct a sheltered area where commuters can sit while waiting for the buses.
Morey said that the route changes will benefit both the neighborhood and the university.
“[The Campus Plan] gave us the benefit of keeping the transportation hub on the perimeter of the campus, and … we increased our storm water retention, so we improve our sustainability,” Morey said.
“We’re not running the buses through campus, which is a safety issue, and we want the campus to be more pedestrian-friendly.”
Morey said that the rerouting project will add new trees and a rain garden to the bus stop.
Despite the university’s assertion that the new bus routes will remain efficient, the changes were poorly received by many riders, particularly employees of Medstar Georgetown University Hospital.
Many employees, as well as students and faculty, who commute to the hospital rely on the Dupont Circle bus, which currently stops directly outside of the hospital.
The new pick-up spot in front of McDonough is roughly a 10-minute walk from the entrance to the hospital.
“It’s a pain,” Kim Zagory, an administrative assistant at the hospital, said.  “It’s a long walk and that’s problematic, particularly for patients who may have mobility problems or people who are ill.  It’s a hospital.”
In response, the university plans to have a 10-person golf cart called a jitney that will shuttle riders to and from the hospital and bus stop.  The jitney is primarily intended to accommodate mobility impairments, though it will be available for all riders.
Other commuters indicated that they were more accepting of the change in the bus routes.
“[It’s] a little annoying, but it doesn’t impact me that much since I already take the Rosslyn bus over here,” Charlotte Valentine (GRD ’17) said. “There’s a lot more traffic exiting near Reservoir Road than there is Canal Road so I understand why they’re changing it, but it’s going to be a long walk in the winter.”
Despite these complaints, Morey said that the university has not experienced any official pushback over the rerouting of the GUTS buses.
“Overall it will be a net benefit, but change is tough sometimes, and it will be a little challenging when we first start,” Morey said.

They haven’t received any official pushback because Robin Morey has refused to publicize this information, poll the student or hospital staff, and instead bows down to the ridiculous wishes of the neighborhood, who for some shocking reason have 0 concern for buses going through their neighborhoods when they aren’t Georgetown operated. What a farce

This has been coming for 5 years, folks – I wish people had raised more alarm bells during that time, before it was too late.
The University capitulated on this back before Robin Morey started at Georgetown, so we can’t totally pin this on him.  Having said that, the least he – and the University – could do is avoid lending credence to the absurd claims of a small number of neighborhood busybodies who are more interested in fighting the University than in improving outcomes for everyone.
This is not some tiny 18th century village we’re talking about here – we’re in the urban core of a major metropolitan area!  There are many dozens of Metrobuses running on the exact same streets that GUTS buses had been running on.  They continue running those routes because complaints about their impacts are completely baseless, and both WMATA and the District would laugh anyone who made them out of a meeting.  But because of the Campus Plan process and the leverage it gives neighbors, these fabrications take hold and are now doing real damage.
At a time when the District, the region, and the nation at large is starting to wise up to the critical importance of mass transit in addressing environmental, economic, and social challenges, the idea that the University is kneecapping its extremely robust and successful bus system because a few rich neighbors think buses are for poor people and don’t belong in their genteel ‘urban village’ is, frankly, revolting.

Jeong Kwang-il, a former political prisoner at Camp Yodok in North Korea, spoke about his experiences in the camp at an event hosted by Truth and Human Rights in North Korea Thursday at the Mortara Center.
Jeong was arrested by the North Korean government in 1999 after he contacted a South Korean citizen while he was on a trip to China. After he was tortured, he falsely confessed to being a spy and was sent to the camp.
Jeong then spent three years in the camp, where he and other prisoners were forced into hard labor under brutal conditions. He was released in 2003 after a senior guard determined he had been wrongly accused.
One month after his release, he escaped North Korea, arriving in South Korea a year later. Once there, he became involved with various advocacy movements to raise awareness within North Korea about human rights violations and to bring information from the rest of the world into the country.
Jeong said that while he was at Yodok, he found that many of the other prisoners shared similar experiences of wrongful imprisonment.
“There were so many people there who weren’t actual political enemies, but who simply uttered something that was deemed offensive,” Jeong said. “They were sent to a prison camp, or tried to escape to China and were arrested by Chinese authorities and ended up in Yodok.”
According to Jeong, prisoners faced daily abuse from guards. The prisoners’ labor consisted of pulling weeds and cutting logs. Jeong said that prisoners who fell behind in their work faced beatings or other punishments.
“At Yodok, prisoners were forced to work 16 hours a day, which was very physically demanding,” Jeong said. “If you did not complete your assigned work quota, you were not given food for that particular day. It was a very difficult situation.”
Jeong said that prisoners worked from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m. and were only permitted to eat one bowl of rice and vegetable soup. At the end of every day, Jeong said that they were forced to take a class for political re-education and were not allowed to sleep until they memorized what they had learned.
“What I experienced at Yoda was inhumane and the time that I spent there is indescribable,” Jeong said.
“When I first came to South Korea and began my life as a resettled defector, I could not sleep at night because I could still see the faces of my fellow inmates at Yodok.”
In 2009, Jeong began to send outside information into his home country. He started off by sending CDs and DVDs, and eventually began sending information through USB flash drives.
“When I myself was living in North Korea, I had no contact with information from outside and I feel that people in North Korea need to know about what is going on outside the country,” Jeong said. “After I came out of North Korea, I saw how important it was to send information.”
Jeong said that the purpose of this information is to create a sense of awareness for the North Korean residents and to educate them on ideas like democracy and freedom.
In response to an audience question about the future of North Korea, Jeong expressed optimism.
“I can’t look into the future, but regarding Kim Jong Un, a regime like that can’t last forever,” Jeong responded. “In due time, I believe that change will happen.”
Julia Rhodes (SFS ’18) said that she was moved by the event.
“I thought the event was particularly powerful because the issue of human rights abuses in North Korea seems almost surreal,” Rhodes said. “It is very grounding to see this story embodied in one single person and I think that it…makes this nightmare seem all the more real.”
Min Joo Lee (SFS ’18) said that the topic of the event was personally relevant to her.
“To us South Koreans, North Koreans are not just anybody. They are actually part of some families who are living in South Korea and are in great pain because of this repressive regime,” Joo Lee said. “This is very personal to me, firstly as a human being, and also as a student who is studying foreign policy. This is what we study for, [and] these are the kind of situations that we want to make better after going through a Georgetown education.”
