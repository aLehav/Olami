The Artist Protection Act of 2009, introduced by D.C. Councilmember Mary Cheh of Ward 3 and set to pass this Council session, seeks to guarantee the establishment of a legal contract between artists and art dealers who seek to sell their work, but the consequences for local art dealers remain unknown.
The act would require that every deal involving a piece of art have a written contract before the art is transferred, and would ensure that if art dealers are faced with credit issues or defaults, the artist would be guaranteed to get a set amount for their works.
After a Committee on Government Operations and the Environment meeting was held Sept. 23, many expect the council will vote on the legislation by the end of the year.
At-Large Councilmember Michael Brown, in a statement released on the D.C. Advocates for the Arts website, said the bill may be altered before the vote.
“As a result of the hearing, amendments may be offered to further clarify the intent of the bill, including adding language to expressly provide that the art dealer must compensate the artist for loss of or damage to a consigned work of art,” Brown said.
Some local Georgetown art galleries are unfamiliar with the pending Council legislation.
Dave Quammen, executive director of MOCA DC, a nonprofit art gallery located at on the C&O Canal, said he was not aware of the pending legislation, but he believed that it would resolve future conflicts.
When running his themed exhibits each month, Quammen allows artists to respond to a call for entries to show their artwork, and his gallery tries to open it up to artists who may not be showing their work in a mainstream commercial gallery. He uses an entry form that was crafted by a D.C. law firm, listing each of the party’s conditions, before the artist’s work is accepted.
Peter Nee, owner of P & Art Galleries at 31st and M Streets and a 34-year veteran of the business, was also unfamiliar with the pending legislation.
“What we do is pretty loose. We just buy [the pieces of art],” Nee said.
Students interested in art think that the bill may have positive effects, however.
“I have learned that sometimes artists shy away from galleries because of fear that they will lose money or tarnish their reputation if associated with a certain gallery. If this act remedies this situation, as residents in Georgetown, we may begin to see new work because artists feel more secure in being shown,” Caroline Gralton (COL ’11), president of GU Art Aficionados, said.
Gralton said that based on her personal experience, this type of legislation is not always necessary, as the artist’s rights are always considered the top priority.
“At the same time, it could be detrimental if gallery directors feel that they can no longer take the same risks or if this is a blow to their relationships with artists,” she added.
Georgetown artist Julien Isaacs (SFS ’12) is used to dealing with the particulars of exhibiting his art, and will be showing four of his pieces at popular Adams Morgan café Tryst this Thursday. In his experiences, most deals with art galleries have been informal and done via email, and this week’s exhibit at Tryst was conducted via an application and contract.
“Contracts can be efficient and help out. But they don’t allow creativity to flow as well. With walls around art, it can compromise creativity, but I’m for it [legislation for contracts] because it’s structured for artists,” he said.
Lindsey Fell, the manager in Cheh’s office, who also has her degree in art, said that the D.C. official code had originally been reformed in 2000, but that an artist in the District informed her that the 2000 alterations were less protective than the original system.
“One thing that managed to get left out [in the 2000 reform] was protection for artists,” Fell said.

While bias-related incidents are at the forefront of many students’ minds in the wake of graffiti incidents two weeks ago, hate crimes at Georgetown have actually been on a decline and occur at a comparable rate to other metropolitan universities.
“The number of hate crimes at Georgetown has been relatively low over the years, which I attribute to the inclusiveness of the university, and the seriousness with which it takes such incidents,” Joseph Smith, associate director of the Department of Public Safety, wrote in an email. “Last calendar year we had a spike in numbers, but that was mostly due to a series of graffiti acts that halted after DPS successfully concluded its investigation.”
Georgetown, in addition to the swastika and Hitler graffiti incidents this year, also experienced two Nazi graffiti occurrences in the spring of 2009 and one in the spring of 2008. In addition, two assaults based on sexual orientation have taken place in recent years, one in the fall of 2007 and one in the fall of 2009.
According to officials within the administration, however, such incidents were the exception. At a community meeting following the most recent instances of graffiti, Vice President for University Safety Rocco DelMonaco said he was surprised by how few incidents there had been at the university over the years.
Area universities have experienced similar instances of bias. In the fall of 2007, eight different cases of Nazi-inspired graffiti were found over three weeks at The George Washington University, according to The GW Hatchet.
In September 2007 a noose was reported hanging outside the black cultural studies center at the University of Maryland in College Park. The Diamondback, the University of Maryland’s student newspaper, reported a decline in hate crimes in recent years, dropping from 24 in 2004 to 10 in 2008.
The New York University Department of Public Safety reported no bias-related incidents in 2005 through 2007, the only time period available. Similarly, Columbia University’s Department of Public Safety reported no crimes committed between 2006 and 2008 that qualified as a hate crime.
The Columbia Spectator, however, reported that while no crimes have been identified as hate crimes over the last three years, there have been many potential bias-related incidents. The newspaper described a case in September 2007 in which homophobic and Islamophobic graffiti was discovered in a campus bathroom, as well as a noose left on the door of a black professor’s office.
“Downward trends may indicate a greater understanding and awareness among university students, strides in inclusiveness by metropolitan universities and consistent enforcement of student conduct codes and criminal codes pertaining to these acts,” Smith said.

This year, one lucky, single student may be the focal point of his or her own rose ceremony in “The Bachelor: Georgetown Edition,” courtesy of student-run television station GUTV.
“The Bachelor,” will be one of four new programs aired this academic year., along with a reality show following first-year students and a political talk show.
GUTV’s staff pursued the ABC-inspired matchmaking program to overcome what they viewed as a lackluster dating scene on campus, according to GUTV’s Station Director Dunja Panic (MSB ’13).
Creators Angela Morabito (SFS ’13) and Rich Rinaldi (MSB ’12), THE HOYA’s staff development director, will produce “The Bachelor: Georgetown,” which remains in the pre-production phase as GUTV seeks to cast a specific type of contender: “outgoing, confident students who are going to have fun with the experience and be fun to watch,” Morabito said. The casting process consists of an online application and screen test, to be held in the coming weeks.
The application for screen time consists of a series of questions, including asking potential candidates to describe their motivations for applying, to relay the history of their last relationship, and to identify the stereotype they feel best fits their personality.
Unlike many contemporary reality shows, Georgetown’s rendition of “The Bachelor” will not make any attempts at sensationalism, according to Morabito.
“The Bachelor’ will not try to create drama or embarrassment. We are going to try to select people who work well together,” she said,
Whether or not the show, set to document the relationships between a single individual and a to-be-determined roster of romantic hopefuls, will follow a bachelor or bachelorette will be decided based on application strength.
Morabito said casting has revealed surprising results. “I don’t think people realize how many Hoyas there are looking for love here on the Hilltop,” she said. “I had no idea that the show would generate as much interest as it has. Demand to participate has been huge.”
Additionally, while she expected a majority of freshman female participants, so far “[the responses have] come exclusively from sophomores, juniors and seniors – and over half of [them] have come from guys,” she said.
As casting continues, the format of the new television series is in the works. As a general framework, producers believe that the show will follow cast members on short, unscripted dates. According to Morabito, GUTV may even seek a sponsorship from The Corp in order to finance the outings. The specifics of production, including the time frame for filming, have yet to be determined.
While air time and cast size remain unknown, the program has generated both excitement and a little cynicism among students.
“Georgetown has a way of making it really hard to meet people outside of organizations that ultimately you need to be professional in,” Alex Honjiyo (SFS ’13) said. “And so dating someone is really not an option a lot of the times.”
“It sounds like one of those trashy shows that I would in all likelihood not watch,” he said.
Panic remains excited about the show, hoping it will allow true love to blossom among her peers.
“Then again,” she added, “I am a hopeless romantic.”

Homecoming may have brought a steady stream of school spirit to the Hilltop this past weekend, but it also brought the university a small flood of alumni funding.
“Our really large events like homecoming drive a spike in giving,” Jeff Donahoe of the Office of Advancement said. “[Alumni] are thinking about Georgetown and about seeing their friends, so it’s on their mind.”
The Office of Advancement, which handles everything from monetary contributions to communications, is still crunching numbers, but Donahoe said that alumni giving rates are up already from last year. Statistics from the 2010 fiscal year showed that 27 percent of undergraduate alumni contributed donations.
This year, the university was able to garner support even from its most recent grads, challenging those from 2005 to 2010 to see which class could number the most donors. Despite their status as the most recent members of the Georgetown alumni community, the Class of 2010 came out on top with 163 donations.
Right now, the university’s most prominent donor project is the 1789 Scholarship Imperative, which seeks to raise $500 million by 2014 in order to create 1,789 annual scholarships. According to Donahoe, most donations to the university go toward this fund.
“People respond to it,” he said of the project. “It’s very motivating, and it puts a face on the donation.”
The 1789 Imperative is endowed by the Georgetown Fund, which is currently contributing every dollar it collects to the project. The money is then divided into $25,000 blocks and issued as scholarships. Donors can contribute cash or appreciated securities, stocks and bonds.
Some alumni donors also contribute directly to departments, clubs or athletic teams, often to ones in which they were involved when in school.
“People tend to give where their heart is,” Donahoe said, adding that the school sees donations that are directed toward the library, campus ministry and athletics, among other destinations.
Alumni who donate annually are enrolled in the Georgetown University Loyalty Society, which is comprised of reliable yearly donors, some of whom have contributed for over 20 consecutive years.
Homecoming is only one of several major celebratory and fundraising events that rake in contributions to the university. According to Donahoe, annual class reunion weekends often result in donations, as does John Carroll Weekend, a spring gala that commemorates alumni volunteering and benefaction.
In the past, the John Carroll celebration has been held in locations around the world, such as New York City, Madrid, Paris and London.
Alumni donations can also come, and often do, in the form of time commitments. Georgetown maintains an extensive network of willing volunteers who interview prospective students through the Alumni Admissions Program. Over 18,000 volunteers also offer informational interviews and networking opportunities to current students though the Alumni Career Network.
According to Theresa Mutter, assistant director of Class Programs, alumni volunteering also spikes around major events. Still, she said, thousands of alumni volunteer every year.
“There are a total of around 1,200 main campus class volunteers alone,” she said in an email.
Whether their contributions are in dollars or in minutes, Georgetown alumni are giving back to their alma mater.

In 1997, University of Pennsylvania student Michael Saunders grew frustrated with the inconvenience of ordering food over the phone. More than a decade later, he is now the president of Campusfood, a website that serves over 300 college campuses across the country – but local restaurants listed on the site are not universally pleased with the service.
According to its website, Campusfood is a virtual food court, an online company that allows college students to browse the menus of all restaurants that deliver to their campus. Students can then place their order through the site and have the food delivered to their door within an hour.
But fees for customers and restaurants alike irritate employees of participating eateries.
“I would definitely call Campusfood a necessary evil,” said Mike Arthur, the assistant manager at Wingo’s on O Street. “It’s so expensive to use, for restaurants and for students. They charge the students a service fee, and they charge 5 to 10 percent of every order to the store. We wish everyone would just order through our website instead.”
Arthur said he feels that despite the extra cost, restaurants have no choice but to register with the site.
“You’ve got to be on Campusfood because their online presence is so huge,” he said. “They bring all the business.”
Across the street from Wingo’s, the owner of Kitchen No. 1 also said that Campusfood is not an ideal option for online ordering despite receiving 111 orders through the website just last week.
“Campusfood has the worst service,” owner Joey Chan said. “If there is a problem with the order and you call customer service, they will keep you waiting to talk to someone. You will be on the phone 20 or 30 minutes and then the customer won’t receive their food on time.”
Steve Awadallah at the Wisey’s on Wisconsin Avenue said he noticed a decline in customer service at Campusfood since Wisey’s joined the website four years ago.
“When they first started out they were very Mom and Pop, and we loved them. But now that they’ve grown they’ve started outsourcing customer service, and there’s all these middlemen now. . I have seven calls to them that they still haven’t returned.”
Despite obstacles in service and steep fees, employees at other local eateries said the site is linked to jumps in business.
“Campusfood is a great service,” said Mehei Hosin, manager at Quick Pita. “We definitely get more orders from students because of Campusfood. . We’re all for it.”
According to Sri Suku, co-owner of Crepe Amour on M street, the restaurant joined the website this fall because of the publicity it provides.
“I think it’s a great avenue for students to use to get food. It gives us the exposure we need on campus,” Suku said.
As the dominant online ordering service for students, Campusfood uses games and discounts to encourage students to order through them.
“Last year they had a game on Facebook called Food Frenzy where you could earn coupons to restaurants by playing a game. It was a pretty good deal, and you could get coupons almost every day if you were lucky enough,” Matthew Davis (COL ’11) said.
This year the site grants students points for placing orders and meeting certain challenges like ordering three pizzas in one week.
“I order through Campusfood at least a couple times a week,” Reilly Hart (COL ’11) said. “It’s just the convenience of having a one-stop website. I like that it keeps track of all the various restaurants, and I like that I can just type the order online.”
“I know some people who pay close attention to the points system,” Hart said. “I have a friend who has said, `I’ve ordered pizza this week, I’m going to order pizza so I can get the achievement.’ But I don’t really pay attention to that.”
Above all, students value Campusfood for the convenience.
“I don’t even notice the service fees or delays,” Davis said. “I think it’s worth it for the convenience, having all the menus and everything in one place. It’s definitely worth it.”
Campusfood did not respond to requests for comment..

The Residential Judicial Council, a student-run disciplinary body, has been discontinued for the academic year in an attempt to improve its inner workings and to provide more leadership opportunities for participating students, according to Office of Residence Life Associate Director Ed Gilhool, who served as adviser for the program last year.
“Although we have heard a couple [of] concerns [about the hiatus], overall the involved students saw this as a valuable opportunity,” Gilhool said in an email.
But in the absence of a peer-run board like RJC, some students feel their voice in disciplinary issues is being silenced.
“I think it is kind of disappointing that there is a lack of voice for the students,” Anna Highberger (COL ’13) said.
Tyler Holl (COL ’13), a member of the Honor Council, is disappointed in the lack of perspective without a group of students overseeing the types of disciplinary issues RJC RJC heard Class A violations of the Code of Student Conduct, which include defacement, disorderly conduct, minor drug offenses, ID card offenses, noise violations, violation of the guest and party registration policies, failure to meet deadlines of any disciplinary sanction and other infractions generally associated with housing rules.
The council also heard some Class B violations in which the student accepted responsibility for the offense. The Office of Student Conduct deals with more serious Class B and C violations.
“It’s very important to have peers judging peers. . We have a different perspective as youth. It is good to have a dual perspective when there are both students and adults [overseeing these matters],” Holl said.
“I think it’d be one thing if they emailed the student body, but I never heard about it, and that’s really upsetting.”
The Residential Judicial Council launched during the 1999-2000 academic year as a way to foster responsibility and accountability by decreasing friction between the student body and the administration, according to the Residence Life website. Their mission professes a forum for students to appear before peers instead of an administrative hearing officer.
“The reason for the temporary hiatus is two-fold. First, RJC has never undergone a review and based on feedback from past members, it is clear there are opportunities to improve its structure and role in the student conduct process. Also, coming into this year, membership was low,” Gilhool said.
In the past, the council consisted of one student chair, three permanent representatives and one administrator, usually a hall director. RJC in the past worked as a full council for four nights a week.
“Coming into this semester, membership was such that we could not operate one full council night. In addition, no involved students expressed interest in the RJC administrator position – the student who recruits and trains all members, schedules all of the meetings and manages the overall operation of the organization,” Gilhool said.
“With low membership numbers and an absence of an administrator, combined with the desire to review the current program, the decision was made to take a year to evaluate and develop a strategic plan for the organization.”
Gilhool said he has met with students who are interested in overhauling the program.
The Office of Residence Life said that it hopes to bring back the council next fall with a focus on bringing students more into the conduct process.
Nevertheless, the program is not in effect this year.
“Students that came before the RJC could at least expect a judgment from individuals facing similar pressures, living situations, and demands on their time,” Shea Houlihan (SFS ’13) said. “RJC lent empathetic understanding to rulings. It also called on students to be accountable and `own’ their living spaces – that is a level of personal investment that Georgetown could use more of.”

When he began his ascent up the corporate ladder from his kitchen to a partnership with Coca-Cola Inc., Chief Executive Officer of Honest Tea Seth Goldman had a basic skill set to work with.
“My experience was that I drank beverages,” Goldman said jokingly to an audience of about 50 people early Monday evening in Lohrfink Auditorium as part of the McDonough School of Business Distinguished Leaders Series.
In 1998, Goldman launched Honest Tea with the help of one of his professors from Yale, Barry Nalebuff. He got the idea to go forward with the idea of a tea company after a run through Central Park one day when he realized that there were no beverages he wanted to drink, and he wanted to have a hand in changing that.
His first sale was to Fresh Fields, a precursor to Whole Foods. The deal began when the duo brought five thermoses of their homemade tea and an empty Snapple bottle to a meeting with the organic foods grocer.
Goldman recalled feeling somewhat inadequate to the challenge before him, but at the end of the meeting, Whole Foods asked the pair to make 15,000 bottles of the beverage in two months – a daunting task that they managed to fulfill.
The first intern to help this new company was MSB alumna Beth Bracken, who helped move the 1998 office from Goldman’s bedroom to an office in town.
Goldman emphasized to the audience the need for divergent thinking and an innovative spirit. “Find something you care about and take it in another direction,” he said. “If you do, you’ll be passionate and relentless.”
Honest Tea now has over 70,000 outlets and is produced in three Coca-Cola facilities. The company has had a 60 percent annual compound growth since 1998.
Goldman said that the attempt to incorporate health and wellness, environmental consciousness, and social response into a brand by using all-natural ingredients will soon become something that consumers will expect companies to do.
He closed his talk with words of encouragement not only to business majors, but to all students in attendance.
“If you have a compelling idea, you’ll get an opportunity,” Goldman said. “Remember, it’s not a sprint. It’s an endurance [race]. We’re building something long term.”
Angela Damiano, an MSB graduate student, found Goldman’s words of wisdom helpful.
“I found it to be really interesting and informative. I heard about the [partnership] with Coke and I wanted to see what his side of the story was,” she said.

Three weeks ago, the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union announced a new record of $16 million in assets. On Monday afternoon, Arjun Mehta (SFS ’11), CEO of GUAFSCU, sat down with The Hoya to discuss GUASFCU’s new financial highs, new services for GUASFCU customers and giving back to the Georgetown community.
 
 
 
How have the results of the new school year been? Has GUASFCU been popular with the new students?
 
 
 
We’ve grown over 37 percent in the past year, which is a fantastic year, in retrospect. We’ve been very successful among new students this school year, especially during open accounts weekend, the first weekend of the year for new students. We’ve also had a lot of success with our online banking, with the majority of new accounts being formed online. I think that the key aspect of our growth last year, however, has been from alumni retention. We have always tried to set it up so that students have no reason to close their accounts when they graduate.
 
 
 
 
 
What opportunities does GUASFCU offer to students that other banks or credit unions do not?
 
 
 
When someone comes to campus, they want a banking organization they can trust. As a whole, students are not commonly perceived as trustful with money, but we’ve made sure that we’re seen as, and actually are, the superior option. I think some of the things that draw people to us are that we know what students need. We put ourselves in the position of our customers, and figure out what services we would want the most. A student wants a lot of ATMs; we set it up so that one in 12 ATMs in the [United States] are surcharge free for GUASFCU members. It’s a fantastic network. We also have a free transfer service designed for students, for people relying on allowances from their parents.
 
 
 
At open accounts week, we have a sheet that shows every single rate we have, and not only how we beat Capital One, but every single bank in the area. We just break it down and say, “If you don’t believe us, that’s fine, look at every single rate.”
 
 
 
It’s Georgetown; when they use a GUASFCU card, they can look at it and see Jack the Bulldog on the side, and can be proud to be a part of Georgetown. When people graduate, they show me their card, and say they want to keep it, because it’s a part of Georgetown.
 
 
 
 
 
While you have seen two semesters of unprecedented financial success, your group actually suffered in the time period between 2003 and 2008. What happened in that time period?
 
 
 
To be honest, it’s been the competition. When Chevy Chase, now Capital One, moved to campus, there was a need for us to readjust so as to react to the new competition. I think that while the added competition was originally a setback for our organization, previous boards set us on a track where we could not only compete, but also succeed against our competitors. We lowered our fees across the board, and raised our saving rates. It also drove us to make our focus on the customer our No. 1 priority. That’s not always how it was in the past, but we’ve emphasized it now. Because of that, we’ve grown significantly.
 
 
 
 
 
What percentage of current Georgetown students has an account in GUASFCU?
 
 
 
It’s a bit more than half. I think there are two competing influences on this fact. I think banking’s changing around the world. It’s less about the location, more about the services being provided. Therefore, we’ve had to be more competitive to make sure we maintain our share of the Georgetown market, because the convenience factor has to be very high to convince customers to join, or to transfer from other banks. That’s helped us with our alumni, because now when GUASFCU customers go to New York City, they can find a GUASFCU-affiliated bank at nearly every corner.
 
 
 
 
 
What innovations do you offer to Georgetown students, and what future innovations do you hope to provide?
 
 
 
We’ve upgraded the two ATMs, and we’re in negotiations for a third one. We’re also improving customer services, making sure we have good coverage for service for both students and alumni. One thing we’re happy to announce is an alumni debit card. Every graduating customer of GUASFCU receives a new debit card that has their class printed on the bottom, which also comes with a higher spending limit. It’s a Georgetown pride thing, it’s something you can carry with you and be proud of.
 
 
 
We have only one branch here in Georgetown. We want to get to a point where no one will ever want to quit their account with us, so we’re trying to come up with ways to keep those students connected to us. One thing we’re beta-testing right now is a program where students can take a photo of a check on their phones, send it to us, and deposit it in their account. It’s had good results, and we’re going to roll it out in the next couple of years.
 
 
 
So being able to apply those concepts and those classes is invaluable. It’s a great experience.
 
 
 
 
 
Through what means and organizations do you reinvest money back into the university?
 
 
 
All the revenue we make is reinvested to cut fees, to lower loan rates, and to increase savings rates and other rates, so that members can have the best deal. That’s how we kind of give back to the community, because we’re able to always make our services better for students.
 
 
 
Two organizations that we’re involved in aggressively are the Reimagine Georgetown initiative [an initiative run jointly by The Corp, GUASFCU and THE HOYA]. The Credit Union is the chair this year, and I’m looking forward to leading a lot of fun projects that make Georgetown a better school.
We’ve also created the George Houston Fund, named after George Houston, a former treasurer of the
 
university, who gave the first [certificate of deposit] to the credit union. He was a great proponent of financial literacy among students. And so we’ve been working with the Office of Student Financial Affairs to do a literacy series every year, to bring in speakers on financial issues. We hope to raise $75,000 in three years to make the fund self-sustaining.

As Catholics across the United States continue to debate the legality of gay marriage, Fr. Joseph Palacios, S.J., adjunct professor of sociology, has taken the lead on helping to found Catholics for Equality, a new organization devoted to rallying Catholics in support of gay rights.
Palacios, who serves on the group’s board of directors, said the organization is focused on changing the political debate and civil laws by reforming the Catholic Church’s doctrine.
“Catholics for Equality is an organization intended to move the moveable middle of Catholics,” he said. “We honor the separation of church and state and recognize that civil law applies to all. It is something left to society and not to religion.”
Although Catholic doctrine staunchly rejects civil marriage for gays, Palacios’ organization endorses same-sex marriage, and the Georgetown professor readily points to the progressive leanings of many American Catholics. Forty-eight percent of American Catholics support gay marriage, whereas only 46 percent of all Americans do, according to a May 2010 Gallup Poll.
“Catholicism, as a religious group, is one of the most progressive Christian groups in the [United States],” Palacios said.
“We have a long tradition of social justice in serving the poor and unfortunate members of society. Providing [LGBT people] with equal rights is part of our responsibility as members of the Catholic community, the Eucharistic community, where no one should be excluded.”
He acknowledged dissent among many Catholics in the United States.
“[The opposition] comes from very conservative Catholics for whom gay rights is not even a debate. These are the people who think homosexuality is an illness to be cured,” he said.
For a religion consumed by debate over the issue, Palacios called for a simpler take.
“In my opinion, sexuality is a great mystery. No one has the final word on it,” he said. “The fact remains that we have gay and lesbian family, neighbors [and] co-workers . who need to live their lives and who deserve equal rights.”
Catholics for Equality was founded this January, and now has chapters in D.C., Minnesota, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland and California. The organization focuses on communication through social media and grassroots organizing, with the goal of helping both Catholic and secular gay-rights organizations.
Though a member of the clergy, Palacios has encountered little direct opposition to his activism. While Georgetown’s Cardinal Newman Society, a conservative Catholic group, has written a letter to University President John J. DeGioia voicing its opposition to Catholics for Equality, the university’s official stance remains neutral.
“Georgetown University does not endorse external organizations as a matter of general practice and would not institutionally support entities whose primary position is counter to church teaching,” university spokeswoman Julie Bataille said.

The university endowment posted a 12.3 percent return on its investments in fiscal year 2010, increasing its value to $1 billion, a bounce back from the 16.6 percent drop to $883 million sustained in fiscal year 2009, according to university spokeswoman Julie Bataille.
Though university endowments made inroads toward recovery in fiscal year 2010, Georgetown’s endowment remains significantly smaller than those of its peers.
Harvard’s endowment, the largest in the nation, increased 11 percent to $27.4 billion in fiscal year 2010, while Yale’s grew 8.9 percent to $16.5 billion, Columbia’s jumped by 17 percent to $6.5 billion and the University of Pennsylvania’s by 13 percent to $5.7 billion.
According to University Spokeswoman Julie Bataille, the university’s comparatively small endowment is nothing new.
“Georgetown historically began formal fundraising efforts much later than our peer institutions,” Bataille said in an email.
As Vice President for University Finances Christopher Augostini wrote in a press release, the university’s transition from a regional university to a national institution in the 1980s coincided with a spike in advanced – and costly – research. Though the evolution brought the university international acclaim, it also drained funds.
Additionally, until 2004, Georgetown’s endowment had been managed not by a full-time investment officer, but by an outside consultant and the board of directors. Since hiring Larry Kochard as chief investment officer to manage the endowment in 2004, the fund’s value has grown from $680 million to its current value of $1 billion.
“We’re recovering,” Kochard wrote in a press release when the endowment first hit the $1 billion mark in 2007. “We’ve gone from being below average to above average. To go from being above average to being among the elite, that will take from five to 10 years.”
Until then, according to Bataille, the university will continue to do what it has for decades: Do a lot of good with relatively little.
“The endowment accounts for only 6 percent of our overall operating budget – well below many of our peers,” Bataille said.
In comparison, Harvard relies on its endowment returns to cover about one-third of its operating budget, while Yale’s endowment accounts for almost half of its operating budget.
As the university plans for its next capital campaign, after having posted above-average gains in endowment funds in 2010, Bataille said it is well positioned for future growth.
“Georgetown’s financial team will continue to focus efforts to manage investment and develop a financial plan that will enable the university to meet strategic needs – such as building the science center and keeping our commitments to need-blind admissions and meeting full financial aid for undergraduates – in this challenging economic environment,” Bataille said.

While many students and alumni watched the homecoming football game on Saturday afternoon, the bakery attached to F. Scott’s at 1232 36th St. caught fire. D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services arrived at the scene at about 2:45 p.m. and reported that there was damage to the exterior of the building, but that no injuries were sustained.
The fire spread from the entryway of the building up the exterior of the wall, but was quickly contained. Only the exterior wall sustained damage, according to Sgt. Sean Brooks of D.C. Fire.
“Damage is significant, tens of thousands of dollars if not more,” battalion fire Chief Sean Greene said at the scene.
The restaurant F. Scott’s is located on the same block as local eateries The Tombs, 1789 and Wisemiller’s and across from the Walsh building. While the fire did emit smoke and attracted a crowd of around 20 students en route from the homecoming game, it did not raise a major alarm in the area.
“I don’t know what happened,” said Chris Olart, an employee at Wisemiller’s, the property adjacent to the bakery, who was working during the fire. “I didn’t notice the fire. I just saw the fire trucks coming onto the street.”
D.C. Fire could not determine the cause of the fire.
“This building has been here for a while, it might be 100 years old, [we’re] not sure where the fire started, but it probably burned for a while. . [It] looks like it started in the entrance way, in the walls, then it got down into the basement,” Greene said. Brooks added that the fire was able to spread because the exterior of the building is made of wood.
D.C. Fire has not ruled out crime as the cause of the fire, according to Greene. Others said the fire was an accident.
“I don’t know what happened, but most probably someone threw a cigarette from a sidewalk and set the front of the building on fire,” William Watts, general manager of 1789, which owns F. Scott’s said.
