Washington, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine and other prominent Catholics in the city are calling for the Archbishop of Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl to resign due to his handling of past sexual misconduct cases.
Formerly the bishop of Pittsburgh, Wuerl has been accused in a grand jury report of covering up decades of systematic abuse and sexual misconduct within the Catholic Church.
Wuerl was presented with an honorary degree from Georgetown University in 2014 and has since then spoken at the university several times, including twice in the fall of 2017.
Catholics in the archdiocese and beyond are demanding a response for these findings, which show a lack of action by prominent members of the Catholic Church. More than 40 Catholic school teachers protested for Wuerl’s resignation outside the Mass at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception on Tuesday. Other groups of protesters have also demonstrated outside Wuerl’s home and Sunday Mass at St. Matthews Cathedral, according to The Washington Post.
Trinity Washington University President Patricia McGuire has been the first leader of a Catholic college to publicly call for Wuerl’s resignation.
Protests by members of the Archdiocese of Washington followed two major scandals within the Catholic Church surrounding sexual misconduct. In June, several accusations of sexual misconduct surfaced against Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the former Archbishop of Washington and Wuerl’s predecessor.
Pope Francis requested that McCarrick resign after an investigation conducted by the Archdiocese of New York found certain accusations credible. Wuerl denied having knowledge of McCarrick’s abuse during his tenure as the archbishop of Washington until after the accusations this summer.
In a separate investigation, the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office released a grand jury report Aug. 14 revealing sexual abuse by 300 priests over the course of 70 years in the state.
Wuerl’s name is mentioned 200 times in the report, which describes his mixed record in responding to accusations against abusive priests.
Following the release of the report, former Vatican diplomat to the United States Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò published a 7,000-word letter Aug. 22 that called for the resignation of Pope Francis, accusing him of covering up McCarrick’s abuse.
In his letter, Viganò also accuses Wuerl, a key ally of Pope Francis, for lying about the point at which he became aware of McCarrick’s sexual misconduct.
Ed McFadden, a spokesman for the cardinal, denied that Wuerl had knowledge of McCarrick’s misconduct, according to Catholic News Agency.
“Cardinal Wuerl did not receive documentation or information from the Holy See specific to Cardinal McCarrick’s behavior or any of the prohibitions on his life and ministry suggested by Archbishop Vigano,” McFadden said.
Since the outpouring of accusations, Wuerl’s publishing company cancelled his upcoming book release and officials are considering removing his name from the high school of his Pittsburgh hometown.
Bishops are appointed by popes, and therefore it is rare for a bishop to resign without the resignation of the pope having already taken place.
It is unlikely that Wuerl will resign based on precedent in the Catholic Church, according to Marie Collins, who served on a papal commission on clergy and the sexual abuse of children and is an Irish abuse survivor.
“Until recently, bishops would not have considered resigning,” Collins told The Washington Post. “It’s just not in the culture of the church to fall on your sword. Within the church that would be seen as strong punishment, even though looking from the outside, I believe they should have to pay a much higher penalty.”

“Bishops are appointed by popes, and therefore it is rare for a bishop to resign without the resignation of the pope having already taken place.”
I think this may be a slight typo? Does it mean to say “it is rare for a bishop to resign without the resignation having already been approved by the pope”?
I only ask because popes very rarely resign (Benedict was the first in 1000 years) and because popes must accept a bishop’s resignation in order for it to valid.

A GoFundMe fundraiser for a freshman kicked out of his home due to tension related to his sexuality and for refusing to attend his parents’ church raised over $140,000 to support his Georgetown education, and the university’s financial aid office stepped up efforts to support him.
Seth Owen (SFS ’22), who is gay, planned to attend Georgetown this fall before his Southern Baptist parents presented him with an ultimatum last spring: continue to attend their church, which Owen said regularly preaches against the LGBTQ community, or move out. Owen chose the latter.
“My parents said that’s the church that I’ve chosen—you can attend there or you can move out,” Owen said in an interview with The Hoya. “At one point in the conversation, I knew there was no going back.”
Tensions had been rising between Owen and his parents since his sophomore year of high school, when his father inadvertently discovered Owen’s sexual identity. His parents insisted Owen go through conversion therapy.
“I was put in conversion therapy and it didn’t last that long,” Owen said. “It is very damaging and very depressing.”
A new pastor at the family’s church was the tipping point. Owen strongly opposed the pastor’s anti-LGBTQ and socially conservative message, and presented his concerns to his parents, leading to the ultimatum.
After moving out, the Florida high school valedictorian’s dream to attend Georgetown seemed to dissolve—he had no way to cover his nearly $15,000 in remaining tuition costs based on his expected family contribution.
Owen had filed his FAFSA using his parents’ financial information, assuming that he would have some level of financial support from them throughout college. Georgetown calculated his financial aid award accordingly.
“Georgetown University admits and enrolls students without regard to their financial circumstances and is committed to meeting the demonstrated financial need of eligible students through a combination of aid programs that include grants, scholarships, employment and loans from federal, state, private and University resources,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While we cannot comment on any individual case, we work closely with students whose financial circumstances change after admission to modify financial aid assistance and ensure they can still enroll regardless of their ability to pay.”
But when Owen moved out, his financial circumstances drastically changed. Owen was couch surfing at friends’ homes and working part-time at Publix, a Florida supermarket, while also balancing the school work and extracurricular activities of a typical high school senior.
Owen submitted his change in financial status, appealing his financial aid award in an attempt to gain status as an independent student. The Office of Student Financial Services denied his first request because his parents had voluntarily submitted their financial information and because he did not make enough money at Publix to feasibly be supporting himself independently, Owen said.
Owen then tried to apply for a $20,000 private loan, but without his parents to cosign for him, he did not qualify for the loan. Owen then appealed his financial aid award a second time, providing letters from multiple sources in an attempt to prove that his circumstances were legitimate.
During this process, Owen realized that without an altered financial aid award, he would not be able to attend college at all, even if he went to a different school.
“I was talking to someone from the financial aid office and I remember breaking out in tears on the phone call,” Owen said. “Even staying in-state, I was still not able to afford it.”
In the meantime, Owen’s high school biology teacher, Jane Martin, started a GoFundMe to help meet the gap between his initial financial aid award and the cost of attending Georgetown, which is estimated to be $74,320 for first-year students in 2018-19.
Martin started the GoFundMe in June with an initial goal of $20,000. The GoFundMe quickly went viral, receiving nationwide media attention and raising $141,636 before it was closed to donations.
While the GoFundMe put the Office of Financial Services in the national spotlight, Owen’s second appeal helped him qualify for a Pell Grant, a scholarship through the Georgetown Scholarship Program and an increased unsubsidized loan. He ultimately was able to negotiate an expected family contribution of $0, although he is taking out a sizable amount in federal loans.
“The Office of Student Financial Services was instrumental in helping me enroll in the Georgetown Scholarship Program, whose purpose is to make attendance at Georgetown possible for students in a financial situation similar to my own,” Owen said in a statement initially released on his GoFundMe page. “This program also includes mentoring and networking opportunities which will help me to assist others in situations similar to the one I found myself in earlier this year.”
Owen said that the GoFundMe prompted multiple alumni to reach out to the university, and that he is aware that the university received dozens of media requests. He expressed disappointment that it seemed as if action on his case was delayed until the story went viral.
“My issue was not that my financial aid package be revised. My issue was that there was no action taken until someone reached out on my behalf,” Owen said. “They didn’t do anything until someone spoke up for me.”
However, Owen is now looking forward to beginning his first year at Georgetown after supportive alumni, faculty and staff and other university affiliates reached out.
“I’m extremely excited to attend now,” Owen said. “I’ve had faculty members from Georgetown reach out and offer their support and encouragement.”

Since it first launched in 2007, the annual party hosted by Lauinger Library during the fall semester, “Club Lau,” is cancelled, due to a lack of sufficient funds to pay library staff and Georgetown University Police Department officers and provide amenities for the event.
Katherine Thomas, Lauinger’s communications and marketing coordinator, said that the decision to cancel the event was made over the summer, after realizing that the necessary funds to staff the event exceeded the current budget for the library.
“Club Lau is a complex event requiring funding for library staffing and a robust GUPD presence to assist with crowd control, as well as movers, lighting, refreshments and music,” Thomas wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In addition to the costs of resources for the event, in April, GUPD increased security costs for on-campus events with high expected attendance, making the cost of having officers more expensive. GUPD’s typical rate for event security is $52.25 per hour per officer.
Though the event is cancelled for this fall, the university plans to host a similar event in subsequent years, according to Thomas.
“We are hopeful that the library will be able to support a revised version of this event next fall,” Thomas said.
Club Lau has taken place annually in early September since 2007 and it attracts an average of 1,500 to 2,000 students each year, Thomas said.
Several students and the Georgetown University Student Association are disappointed with the library’s decision to cancel the event.
GUSA Historian Henry Westerman (SFS ’21) said GUSA is working to keep Club Lau open to students this fall.
Julia Harris (COL ’20) said Club Lau was one of her favorite memories at Georgetown, and she appreciated its inclusive atmosphere.
“For me it was one of the few chances as a new Georgetown student to go out and have fun at an event that was open to everyone,” Harris wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It makes me sad that new students won’t have the opportunity to experience it because I made some of my closest friends on the dance floor at Club Lau.”
Jack Korologos (COL ’21) compared Club Lau to Georgetown’s New Student Orientation, saying it assists in new students’ transition to Georgetown.
“Club Lau itself isn’t the most fun someone will have at Georgetown by any means. That’s not what it was for,” Korologos said. “Freshman year is a big change and Club Lau helped ease that process in its own special way. All in all, Club Lau was the best welcome that Georgetown offered to the incoming freshmen.”
Although library staff planned and hosted Club Lau, student organizations such as Georgetown Weeks of Welcome, an outreach and programming group that facilitates students’ transition to campus during the first six weeks of the school year, contributed to publicity efforts in the past.
GWOW Co-Coordinator Casey Wetherbee (SFS ’21) said this year Lauinger Library asked GWOW to publicize an escape room event hosted by the library, called “Escape the Hilltop Conspiracy,” which will include puzzles, riddles and clues for players to try to exit a room.
“Historically, we have reached out to Lauinger Library, and they have sent us their events (which, until this year, have included Club Lau),” Wetherbee wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This year, they reached out to us so that we could promote an Escape Room that they will be running on September 14 and October 12. However, there was no mention of Club Lau.”
The escape rooms for the “Escape the Hilltop Conspiracy” are in their initial phases, but library staff members may add more dates if initial trials go well. Developed by students, faculty and librarians, the escape rooms seek to provide an engaging mystery that incorporates research and problem-solving skills for participants.
Thomas said that though Club Lau is not set to occur this fall, Lauinger still intends to host other events for the community.
“The library is reviewing its events and programming with campus partners and will work throughout the academic year to continue to engage with Hoyas in other meaningful ways,” Thomas wrote.

The total number of reported cases of sexual assault in Washington, D.C. this summer increased by 3 percent from last summer, according to data from the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.
Every district except for the First District had an increase in reported instances of sexual assault, according to an Aug. 26 WTOP article, and the total number of reported cases was 416, up from 401 last summer.
The number of reported sexual assaults occurring on sidewalks and on public streets increased by nearly 21 percent, tallying to a total of 110 reported incidents, according to the WTOP article. Adams Morgan and Dupont Circle, both part of the Third District, saw a 42 percent increase in assaults on the street or sidewalk.
The Seventh District, which encompasses much of Southeast D.C., experienced the largest increase in reported sexual assaults with a jump to 17 this summer from three reports last summer.
The District’s MPD declined to comment on the increased numbers.
The rise in reports of sexual assaults in the city are mirrored on campus, where the number of reports of sexual assault have increased. Georgetown University Police Department records indicate that between January 2018and July 2018, the number of reported sexual assault cases on Georgetown’s campuses was higher than the number of reported cases during the entire prior year.
Samantha Berner, interim Title IX coordinator, said the increasing number of reports of sexual assaults on campus can be attributed to a greater effort by the university to raise awareness about how individuals can report instances of sexual misconduct.
“Increased reporting of sexual misconduct at Georgetown is consistent with current national trends and is expected because of widespread efforts to encourage reporting and raise awareness about where and how reports can be made,” Berner wrote in an email to The Hoya.
To raise awareness on where and how to report instances of sexual assault, the university has increased educational programs and made policies more concise, Berner wrote.
“At Georgetown, we continue efforts — like climate surveys, revisions to policies, and ongoing information poster campaigns — that contribute to a better understanding of what constitutes sexual misconduct, where to report, and how to get help, which can all lead to an increase in individuals seeking support and reporting,” Berner wrote.
As part of ongoing programming to increase awareness for reporting instances of sexual misconduct on campus, the university plans to conduct its second campus climate survey in 2019, three years after its first such survey in 2016, to examine the prevalence of incidences of sexual assault on campus to help the university determine how to prevent further misconduct, according to Berner.
Until the survey is published, the university is continuing to increase educational opportunities and programming about where and how to report instances of sexual misconduct.
Resources on campus already in place to combat sexual assault include a mandatory online educational course for first-year students about sexual assault prevention and a bystander training course, which had a 98 percent completion rate this year and a 94 percent rate last year. In addition, the office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action launched an online resourcecenter to provide answers for students who have questions about sexual misconduct on campus.
“Georgetown is committed to preventing and addressing sexual assault and misconduct through comprehensive trainings, programs, and engagement with the campus community,” Berner wrote. “We continue to focus our efforts on education and prevention, support for survivors, and prompt and equitable response processes.”

The Georgetown community is mourning the deaths of Lauren Geoghegan (COL ’10) and Jay Austin (GRD ’10), who were killed in an attack in Tajikistan when five assailants rammed into a group of cyclists with an SUV before pursuing the group with knives. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack.
The two had recently quit their jobs in Washington, D.C., to travel the world together as a couple.
Along with Geoghegan and Austin, two other cyclists, Rene Wokke from the Netherlands and Markus Hummel from Switzerland were also killed in the attack. The cyclists were visiting the Danghara region, a popular destination among tourists in Tajikistan and about 90 miles south of the nation’s capital, Dushanbe.
The death of the two Hoyas has deeply impacted many members of the Georgetown community.
Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69), Georgetown’s dean of undergraduate admissions said Geoghegan’s death was especially significant given her seven years working with the admissions office.
“We are heartbroken to hear of Lauren’s passing in this devastating tragedy and have expressed our deepest condolences to her family,” Deacon wrote in a news release. “Lauren was a valued colleague and dear friend to many at Georgetown and an overall treasured member of our community.”
A university spokesperson told The Hoya on Aug. 14 that university administrators will remain in contact with family members and inform campus community members of plan to honor Geoghegan and Austin’s lives.
Before embarking on her journey to cycle across the world, Geoghegan worked in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at Georgetown between 2010 and 2017. She graduated in 2010 from the university, where she majored in Government, and minored in Spanish and Arabic. After Austin received his master’s degree in Government from Georgetown, he began to work the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Austin also notably built a tiny home, nicknamed “The Matchbox,” which was featured on several TV shows.
On “Simply Cycling,” the blog that the couple kept together to document their travels, Austin explained their decision to leave their jobs to cycle around the world.
“We wanted to learn new things, live a life on simpler, more deliberate terms, spend more time together and meeting others and being outdoors, and see the world,” Austin wrote in June 2017.
The couple began their journey in South Africa, cycling to Tanzania, before flying to Europe and cycling to Turkey. According to the blog, last updated on June 21, 2018, about a month before the attack in Tajikistan, Geoghegan and Austin were making their way through central Asia, with the intention of eventually making their way through, Eastern Asia, South East Asia, Oceania, and then cycling from South America back to North America.
Although IS has claimed responsibility for the attack, the Tajikistani government is blaming the Islamic Renaissance Party, a local political party that had been banned by the government three years ago.
The State Department, however, has stated it finds the attack consistent with other IS-inspired assaults on groups of civilians. The State Department condemned the “senseless” attack. Other experts also agreed that the attack, despite being the first of its kind in the region, resembled other IS-inspired attacks.
“There is strong evidence that was an IS-inspired attack — the first such attack on foreigners by IS in the region, and it is therefore crucially important that Tajik authorities credibly, carefully and professionally conduct their investigation,” Steve Swerdlow, Central Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, said to The Washington Post. “The government’s narrative blaming the IRPT for the attack simply doesn’t add up. It’s just simply shooting itself in the foot.”
After the attack, IS released a video with the identified assailants, pledging their allegiance in Russian to the leader of the caliphate, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and promising to slaughter disbelievers.
Though, the couple’s trip ended in tragedy, the two had long held that, despite their differences, people generally treat each other decently, Austin wrote on his blog on April 5, 2018.
“Badness exists, sure, but even that’s quite rare. By and large, humans are kind. Self-interested sometimes, myopic sometimes, but kind. Generous and wonderful and kind. No greater revelation has come from our journey than this,” Austin wrote.

A $1 million grant for research on the social enterprise movement and women’s economic mobility was awarded by the Bank of America Charitable Foundation to the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and the McDonough School of Business’ Global Social Enterprise Initiative in August.
The grant is intended to spur research on methods for fostering economic opportunity for women living in nations in conflict, according to GIWPS. The study is formally commencing at Bank of America’s October conference on women’s entrepreneurship in Dublin.
The grant also creates a Bank of America Research Fellow position for the next two years; Raiyan Kabir (GRD ’17) is filling the position for the 2018-19 academic year. For the first phase of research, GIWPS is concentrating on actions that would enhance women’s economic equality in conflict-torn nations, according to Ambassador and Executive Director of GIWPS Melanne Verveer.
“There are a growing number of fragile states in the world,” Verveer said in a news release. “Women’s economic empowerment is an issue of utmost importance because it is critical for economic viability, political stability, and peace and security.”
The grant will be put toward research that can help eliminate gaps in women’s economic opportunities, according to Verveer.
“This important research will fill a critical need by contributing to what we know about creating economic opportunity and improving conditions for women,” Verveer said in the news release.
The grant will also serve to fund research on the extent of the broadening social enterprise field for the Global Social Enterprise Initiative. GSEI is exploring how social enterprises, which are businesses focused on positive social impact, increase economic mobility, particularly in the United States.
The GSEI aims to use its findings to make social enterprises more efficient, particularly analyzing how large multinational companies can advance their own causes while creating shared value for others.
GSEI leaders hope the research will help students learn to balance their industry’s bottom lines with the well-being of society at large, aligning with Georgetown’s Jesuit values, according to Leslie Crutchfield, executive director of GSEI.
“We are trying to understand how the social enterprise movement is accelerating economic mobility for the nation’s most vulnerable and marginalized people,” Crutchfield said in the news release.
Through grants like this, the Bank of America Charitable Foundation intends to support communities struggling with economic mobility, workforce development and education, as well as the organizations that study and assist them, according to President of the Bank of America Charitable Foundation Kerry Sullivan.
“We are guided by a common purpose to make financial lives better,” Sullivan said in a news release. “Supporting research and programs like those at Georgetown is a key demonstration of how we deploy capital and invest in partnerships that advance women entrepreneurs and build thriving communities.”
The foundation funded similar GIWPS studies in the past. Previous support for GIWPS led to the creation of the Women, Peace and Security index, which seeks to quantify the state of women’s well-being across the globe and identify which nations pose the greatest and most disproportionate risk to women. Bank of America says that advancing economic mobility is one of the focuses of its leadership, and that research by the GSEI will give women the tools they need to expand this focus.
In addition to the funding, the Bank of America Charitable Foundation is planning to continue to co-host a series of lectures on leadership on Georgetown’s campus. Past lectures have featured Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, U2 lead singer Bono and filmmaker Ken Burns.

A Downtown Day Services Center that offers essential resources and social services to adults experiencing homelessness is set to open on New York Avenue by Nov. 1.
The construction of the center will be funded by a $1.7 million grant announced by Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) on Thursday as part of her ongoing campaign to end homelessness in Washington, D.C.
“The Downtown Day Services Center will enable us to reach more individuals and get more residents connected to the resources and supports they need to stay safe and secure permanent housing,” Bowser said in an Aug. 23 news release. “This center is one more way we can provide individuals experiencing homelessness with the respite and resources they need and deserve.”
The center will operate Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and is anticipated to serve an average of 100 clients per day, according to Department of Human Services Senior Advisor Carter Hewgley.
The initiative will offer visitors social services such as case management, health resources and employment support in addition to meals, computers, showers and laundry facilities through a partnership with Pathways to Housing D.C., District agencies and other non-profit partners, according to the news release.
Clients will be able to access trained case managers to understand and help navigate factors that may be contributing to their homelessness as well peer support specialists who have experienced homelessness in the past, according to Hewgley.
“No matter where you are in your journey, there’s something you can find at the center that will help you stay better connected,” Hewgley said in an interview with The Hoya.
Executive Director of Pathways Christy Respress noted the importance of the center’s ability to merge outreach with available resources.
“This Downtown Day Services Center is incredibly important in our fight to end homelessness,” Respress said in the Aug. 23 release. “It will help bridge the gap between the District’s street outreach teams and service providers while providing a safe and welcoming space for people experiencing homelessness.”
Clients will also have access to legal services as well as assistance with transportation, acquiring critical documents and locating permanent housing through housing assessments. These assessments will take into consideration the client’s needs and vulnerabilities and determine the extent of required support.
Housed in the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, the center will be overseen by the DowntownDC Business Improvement District, a private non-profit organization which seeks to improve the economic and social environment in a 138-block area of the city.
DowntownDC BID President and CEO Neil Albert commends the program for being the first of its kind.
“A Downtown Day Services Center has for many years been the missing piece in our shared effort to comprehensively address the needs of individuals experiencing homelessness in the District,” Albert said in the Aug. 23 news release.
The center will be open only to adults experiencing homelessness; families and children will continue to be offered support at the Virginia Williams Family Resource Center located on Rhode Island Avenue and the District’s homeless youth drop-in center, Hewgley said.
The Bowser administration’s effort to end homelessness through a housing-first strategy — which provides permanent supportive housing to chronically homeless individuals without requiring psychiatric treatment or maintenance of sobriety before reception of the housing —
has connected 3,900 individuals to homes.
Bowser’s previous campaigns have included a $103 million investment in affordable housing, announced in June, that affected more than 1,700 residents across five wards and the creation of a Homelessness Prevention Program which was launched in October 2015 and helps families avoid sleeping in shelters.

August 31, 2018 by Erin Doherty Leave a Comment 
Los Angeles Times reporter and columnist, Doyle McManus, was named the director of Georgetown College’s undergraduate journalism program this week. As a foreign policy correspondent and Washington bureau chief for the LA Times, he covered demonstrations in Iran’s capital city, Tehran, and the Iran hostage crisis in which 54 American diplomats were held for 44 days. He had a ringside seat at the negotiations between Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev and former Secretary of State James Baker in the late 1980s and early 1990s and he has covered every presidential campaign since 1984. After getting his start in journalism as an undergraduate at the Stanford Daily, he reported for United Press International from Los Angeles, Beirut and Tehran. He continues to write as a columnist for the Los Angeles Times.
The Hoya sat down with McManus to discuss his journalism experiences and his vision for the journalism program more broadly. He said the curiosity that a career like journalism requires has driven him to seek out unforgettable experiences reporting abroad and in the United States.
“The great thing about a long career in journalism is that most journalists get into journalism because they’re driven by curiosity, they want to learn things, they want to figure out how the world works,” McManus said.
What are some of the ideas you have for transforming the program?
There are lots of students, not just in the College, but in the School of Foreign Service in particular, who want more media education of one kind or another, and in effect, we have a responsibility to meet that demand and to meet it well — at a level of quality and intellectual sophistication that matches the abilities and capabilities of the students we are teaching. So that’s a starting point. It’s a program that is small, but strong, and we want to make it a little bigger and a little stronger.
How do you plan to expand the program’s engagement with the DC world?
We’re in one of the great journalism cities of the world. If you choose two cities where you find the best journalists in America, they’re Washington and New York, and I think we can attract more of those journalists to come teach as adjuncts. The program has already been, without any help from me, notably successful in doing that, and look at the list, from Athelia Knight of the Washington Post, who’s been teaching [Introduction to Journalism] for years, to a new recruit who hasn’t taught yet but is going to be fabulous: Liz Bruenig, also from the Washington Post, who is just a terrific mind, a fascinating person and just a really good journalist. She is a great model of how you can be a first rate intellectual and a shoe leather journalist at the same time.
How else do you expect the program to evolve?
Dean [Christopher] Celenza wants us to begin looking at whether Georgetown needs to do more in the area in what we’re calling information literacy. Sometimes it’s called news literacy, sometimes it’s called media literacy. This is really the question: What do undergraduates need, what do all citizens need, in terms of critical thinking skills and background to navigate the firehose of information that comes at us 24 hours a day through our phones? It actually doesn’t matter whether you’re 20-years-old or 70-years-old, none of us have been terribly well prepared to deal with this new environment. And I figure it’s probably too late to educate the 70-year-olds, but we do have a responsibility to the 20-year-olds.
Going back to Georgetown students interested in journalism, what can they do to get involved in the media world?
Like any other career, especially one in a field that is as chaotic and unsettled as this, this isn’t a situation where there are 10 or 20 old line institutions that you can just get online and fill out a job application for. If you want to be a journalist, the way to start is to figure out a way to do journalism. And in fact, Barbara Feinman Todd, who effectively founded this journalism program and left me a terrific foundation to work on, had a wonderful phrase that she used in her classes. The question isn’t “Do you want to be a writer?” the question is “Do you want to write?” It’s a verb, not a noun. Do you want to go do journalism? Do you want to go do reporting? Do you want to do commentary? Do you want to produce video or podcasts? Well, then the answer is [to] find a way to go do it now, because someone out there will go ahead and be glad to have your services at rock bottom prices, all the way down to zero. But there are places you can write for free, there are places you can produce video and audio content for free and you know what, once you’ve produced that, that’s your product and your credential.
As journalism is changing, how do you hope that the program can keep up?
Change or die. If we don’t evolve to keep up with the changes in the environment, evolutionary biology tells us what will happen to us. So that’s absolutely a requirement. So we already of course have the 200-course, Digital News, so we need to make [sure] that’s keeping up, but we have to do more.
Is there anything else happening in the program that you think we should know about? 
I really do think that this is both a scary time and an exciting time to think about, to do journalism and to consider doing journalism as your life’s pursuit. No question that good journalism has never been more important to the health of American democracy, and we get plenty of reminders of that every day. But we also get plenty of reminders that doing journalism well is difficult. It’s demanding and there are lots of commercial pressures in the business of journalism that sometimes reward journalism that isn’t really good. It’s no great accomplishment to make a good living producing bad journalism. Our aim, connecting us to the larger aims of the university, is to help students do good journalism and learn skills that will also help them if, God forbid, they should go into another profession; also that will help them be good citizens, good lawyers, good business executives, good media professionals of any kind.

Safr, a new app focused on safer ride-sharing for women, will expand its network to the Washington, D.C. area this fall, following its launch in Boston last year, according to a press release from the company.
While both men and women are allowed to sign up to become a driver or a rider, the app offers riders and drivers the option of selecting a gender preference for their counterparts.
The company had initially planned to create a women-only platform, Chariot for Women, but potential legal obstacles due to state and federal anti-discrimination laws led to the creation of Safr’s current business model, which serves both female and male passengers.
In addition to allowing riders to choose the gender of their driver, the service seeks to create a safer experience for women by completing comprehensive background checks of drivers.
The app was created in response to complaints against Uber’s lenient background-check policy and failure to monitor drivers for violent or inappropriate behavior once hired, according to DCist. Two women anonymously filed a lawsuit in 2017 against Uber claiming that “thousands of female passengers have endured unlawful conduct by their Uber drivers,” according to its text in a Washington Post article.
The lawsuit is one of many complaints directed at Uber connected to the larger concern that the company is prioritizing profit over the wellbeing of its clients, according to a Boston Globe article published Jan. 26, 2017.
All potential drivers must complete an extensive criminal background check and inspection of their vehicle, as well as interviews with representatives from the company, according to the app’s website. If hired, the drivers must also undergo a safety training session.
A “color-matching” feature within the app, created to ensure proper rider-driver verification, assigns both riders and drivers a color that they must confirm at the start of the ride. The app also includes an SOS feature, which allows the user to contact Safr headquarters, the police or a pre-designated emergency contact in the case of an emergency.
Safr CEO Syed Gilani hopes that Safr will transcend the role of a company and rather function as an extension of daily life.
“Safr aims to be a lot more than a rideshare company,” he wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are not competing against other rideshare, we are only providing an option for safe transportation to women everywhere.”
Safr drivers are paid more than those working for other ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft, according to a DCist article. However, riders are charged 15 percent more than a typical UberX price.
Gilani explained that his company is committed to equal opportunity through its focus on empowering women’s voices.
“Women are not generally given even playing field when it comes to workforce growth and earning potential,” Gilani wrote. “In the rideshare economy, most women drivers only prefer to drive during daylight hours due to their safety concerns which significantly reduces their earning potential in addition to experiencing earning gap/hour vis-a-vis men. Women [also] earn more with Safr as Safr takes only 20% commission vs 35% with other rideshare in certain cases.”
In addition to the service coming to the District, the service will also be available in Atlanta, Dallas, San Francisco and Orlando, Fla., later this fall.
To provide safer transportation alternatives for students on Georgetown’s campus, the Georgetown University Police Department’s SafeRides program is a free option for transportation around the Georgetown neighborhood late at night.
The shuttles, available from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday through Wednesday and from 8 p.m. to 3 a.m. Thursday through Saturday, service West Georgetown, Burleith and M Street. Burleith resident Eva Lucchino (COL ’19) said that the SafeRides service has some limitations.
“SafeRides has a limited range within the Georgetown area with specific pickup spots, so it’s not as convenient as an app,” Lucchino said.
Lucchino said that an app like Safr offers more expansive services than SafeRides.
“I think it’s valuable that people can choose who they are interacting with when getting a ride home after a night out,” she said. “As SafeRides is run through GUPD, using that service could make members of the Georgetown community feel unsafe when going home because they are required to interact with the police.”

Despite Washington, D.C.’s ongoing efforts to control its rat population, the number of resident complaints to the city are expected to continue to increase after reaching an all-time high in 2017.
The D.C. rat population is rapidly growing because of a number of factors, including its increasing human population and rising number of restaurants and bars, which have brought record levels of trash to D.C. streets, attracting the rodents, according to WTOP.
Districtwide construction has also disrupted underground rat burrows, so the rodents have become more noticeable aboveground and inside buildings, particularly homes and restaurants. Additionally, mild winters over the last few years have killed fewer rats than in the past, according to The Washington Post.
The rats are both unnerving to residents and, at times, dangerous, according to ecologist and former D.C. consultant Bruce Colvin.
“Rats have been linked to starting fires, chewing on wires, contaminating food and destroying packaging,” Colvintold the Washington Times.
The number of complaints about rats to D.C’s 311 helpline rose by about 2,000 calls in 2017, although less than half of the complaints turned up evidence of rat infestations, according to the chief of the District’s rat control office, Gerard Brown.
This year, those numbers are expected to hold steady or increase, as 3,153 calls were made between January and July, according to The Washington Post.
“It’s an eternal war,” Advisory Neighborhood Commission member Mark Eckenwiler told The Washington Post. “You can kill them in one location and they pop up in another.”
The neighborhoods hit hardest by the rodent crisis include the 16th Street Corridor, Lincoln Park and the Capitol Hill area, according to . The Georgetown neighborhood did not make the top of the list, with the city receiving 21 calls in the last 30 days, according to the city government website.
To combat the rodent problem, the D.C. Department of Health has implemented extermination methods such as dry ice, which vaporizes into carbon dioxide and suffocates rats when dropped into burrows, according to CBS. Dry ice was very effective in reducing a dense maze of almost 150 burrows to under 10, according to WTOP.
The city has also introduced new technology into the extermination efforts, such as sensors on garbage can lids that alert the city when the cans are full, and solar-powered trash cans that compress the trash so that it does not overflow onto the sidewalks. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) also hosted a Dupont Rat Walk in November 2017 that was intended to provide constituents a forum to express their concerns and display what District officials are doing to combat the issue.
Private organizations have also attempted to stem the rat problem. In January 2017, the Humane Rescue Alliance created the initiative “Blue Collar Cats,” which matches businesses and private citizens struggling with rat infestations with stray cats that would otherwise likely be euthanized. The businesses provide food and shelter for the cats, and the cats take care of the rat problem, according to The Washington Post.
D.C. rats have been a problem for decades. In 1999, then-mayor Anthony Williams convened a “rat summit,” in which D.C. leaders could receive advice from national rodent control experts. 
But a long-lasting solution to the District’s rat problem has proved elusive, according to Brown.
“Rats are genius,” Brown told The Washington Times. “You have to always be thinking.”

The Maria & Alberto de la Cruz Art Gallery opened Aug. 27 on the first floor of the Edmund A. Walsh Building, featuring a mix of Georgetown student artwork, travelling exhibitions and historical artwork from museums around the Washington, D.C area.
After almost six months of construction, the gallery plans to hold its first event, “Rob Pruitt’s Flea Market,” on Aug. 29 and 30. The flea market has been held in various locations since 1999, but this is the first time it is held on a college campus, according to an Aug. 27 university news release. The flea market will include local artists and Georgetown clubs, which will showcase and sell their products in market-style set up; the vendors will receive 100 percent of the proceeds.
Maria (CAS ’87) and Alberto de la Cruz (CAS ’89) donated an unspecified amount for the project in Oct. 2015 and construction for the 2,500-square-foot exhibit began in February, 2018.
Al Miner, who became the director and chief curator of Georgetown University Art Galleries and an associate professor of the practice in the Art and Art History department in 2017, will curate the new gallery, which will be focused primarily on contemporary art. Miner won awards for curating modern art and worked at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Smithsonian Institution’s Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.
When he was appointed, Miner outlined his vision for the gallery in an interview with The Hoya in November 2017.
“I look forward to establishing a program that will enhance the lives of those on campus, in the surrounding neighborhood, and within Washington, D.C.’s already vibrant arts scene,” Miner said. “Working in collaboration with key partners across the university, we will place great art and artists at the center of critical dialogues and create opportunities for diverse audiences to not only look at art, but to have meaningful and memorable experiences.”
The Gallery’s first annual exhibit will open on Sept. 27 and will showcase the art of Choctaw-Cherokee artist Jeffrey Gibson. The exhibit, entitled “DON’T MAKE ME OVER,” will explore Native culture, queer identities and modern art, according to the university news release.
Miner outlined the unique style of Gibson’s art, primarily rawhide paintings, highlighting how “DON’T MAKE ME OVER” will contribute to his goal of using the gallery to inspire cross-cultural engagement.
“This is the first time an exhibition will focus so heavily on Gibson’s rawhide paintings,” Miner said in the news release. “These colorful, asymmetrical diptychs are intimate in scale and play with negative space more than Gibson’s prior paintings. They vibrantly bring together Gibson’s interest in Native American painting traditions and the language of Abstraction.”
In addition to the donations from the Cruz’s, the gallery received donations from alumni, parents and members of the College Board of Advisors, according to the university press release.
Miner said that he hopes the new gallery will be a platform for cultivating conversations and engagement between various groups in the Georgetown community.
“We’ll strive to use art and the artistic voice as a platform to continue to promote cross-cultural understanding,” Miner said in the November interview.
The gallery will also present paintings and exhibitions by Glenn Ligon and Chemi Rosado-Seijo until the spring of 2020. Ligon is a widely celebrated black artist and Rosado Seijo, a social practice artist from San Juan, Puerto Rico, developed a program that partnered a museum and a local public school. In addition to the Ligon and Rosado-Seijo exhibitions, the museum is booked through the spring of 2020.

Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service’s class of fellows for the fall semester includes journalists, politicians and political scientists with varied professional experiences and political viewpoints, including Erin Conaton (SFS ’92), the former Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and Under Secretary of the Air Force.
In addition to Conaton, the class includes Republican pollster Ed Goeas, journalist for BBC news Suzanne Kianpour, digital strategist Tim Lim and former Chief of Staff to Mike Pence, Josh Pitcock.
Every semester, five fellows are chosen by GU Politics to lead discussion groups and office hours for students. Past fellows include former Chief of Staff to Nancy Pelosi, Nadeam Elshami and former White House Communications Director and Senior Advisor to President Obama, Jen Psaki.
Jennie Fay, the director of fellows and career programming at the Institute of Politics and Public Service at the McCourt School of Public Policy, said that this semester’s five fellows represent a wide range of political professions and ideologies, which she hopes will spark conversation among students.
“It’s no secret we are witnessing an incredibly divided- and sometimes troubling- time in American politics,” Fay wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Now more than ever, it’s critical we engage those with differing opinions, backgrounds and perspectives to better understand the world around us.”
Conaton is now a visiting professor at the U.S. Army War College. Before she began serving as Under Secretary in the Air Force and in the Department of Defense, Conaton worked as a staff member of the House Armed Services Committee for nine years.
Goeas, the President and CEO of the Tarrance Group, a Republican survey research group, consults on a range of political issues, including health care and immigration. Goeas also partnered with Democratic pollster Celinda Lake to create a national political research program, the George Washington University Battleground Poll. Goeas also served as the national political director of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
Kianpour, an Emmy nominated news reporter, covers foreign policy and national security issues for BBC News. With a focus on the Middle East, Kianpour has covered topics such as the Iran nuclear deal, and she reported on the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States.
Lim focuses on political strategy, organizational development and fundraising through his consulting business, Lim Consulting. In 2012, he founded Precision Network, now a multi-million dollar online advertising platform, and Blue Digital Exchange, which works to increase investment in digital communications. Lim works on fundraising campaigns for many House and Senate candidates, and in 2016, he served on the National Finance Committee of the Hillary for America Campaign.
Pitock currently works as the Vice President for Government Affairs for Oracle Corporation in D.C., where he manages lobbying and strategy. He advised and worked with Vice President Mike Pence for eight years from 2005 to 2017, when he also contributed to President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Before coming to D.C., Pitock practiced corporate law in Atlanta.
Beginning the week of September 24, the fellows will hold weekly office hours and non-credit discussion sessions about current issues in their areas of expertise. Each fellow will also take on a small group of students to assist them with research for discussion groups, promoting their events and connecting them with the rest of the Georgetown community.

Adanna J. Johnson, a former associate professor of psychology and director of the African and African American studies program at Loyola University Maryland, was named the Senior Associate Dean of Students and Director of Diversity, Equity and Student Success this summer.
Johnson, who also co-chaired the establishment of university-wide Racial Justice Training Implementation at Loyola University, will supervise the CMEA and convene university-wide councils addressing issues of diversity and student access and success, according to a university spokesperson.
Her work will support the American Talent Initiative, an alliance of universities, of which Georgetown is a founding member, to increase the number of low- and moderate-income students at top performing undergraduate universities.
“In this new role, Dr. Johnson will provide leadership for a broad range of work focused on student access and success, on our diversity and inclusion work with students, and in contributing to Georgetown’s work with the American Talent Initiative,” a university spokesperson wrote to The Hoya in an email.
The CMEA oversees and hosts residential programs such as La Casa Latina and the Black House; admission events such as Hoya Saxa Weekend, which functions similarly to GAAP Weekend but can better accommodate first generation and low-income students who face socioeconomic barriers; and the Community Scholars Program. The Community Scholars Program invites low-income and first-generation college students to participate in a six-weeklong courses over the summer to assist incoming freshmen in their transition into college.
According to CMEA’s mission statement, the organization aims to improve the educational experience of students whose race or ethnicity could have excluded them from certain benefits and privileges afforded to other students at Georgetown.
A spokesperson for the university said Johnson’s work at Loyola will enable her to contribute greatly to the Georgetown community.
“She has published extensively on a range of topics, with a particular focus on cultural competence and use of cultural approaches to healing as well as recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in higher education,” the university spokesperson said. “Her long clinical experience working with clients further deepens the perspectives she will bring to her work at Georgetown.”
Outside of the CMEA, Johnson will report both to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and to Vice Provost for Education Randy Bass, according to the Office of the Provost.
Johnson’s research focuses on cultural competence and the recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in higher education, according to the Office of the Provost’s website.
“We are excited about all the assets Dr. Johnson brings to Georgetown and to our students and look forward to continue welcoming her to the Hilltop this semester,” a university spokesperson said.
Johnson did not respond to request for comment by the time of publication.
Correction: This article has been updated to correct the spelling of Dr. Johnson’s name and clarify her position.
