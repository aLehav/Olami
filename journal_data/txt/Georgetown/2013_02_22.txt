The final 24 hours of the GUSA executive race were dominated by revelations, allegations and admissions about candidates’ membership in secret societies.
A release Tuesday night of documents and photographs implicated presidential runner-up Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) to be a member of the Second Society of Stewards. The information, posted on an anonymous Facebook page, initiated a day of debate between campaigns and their supporters about the relevance of secret societies to the election.
Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14), who was elected GUSA vice president alongside president-elect Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) yesterday, initially denied being a member of a secret society but later admitted to his membership in an undisclosed group. Tisa, who also had denied Ramadan’s membership, conceded to knowing of it partway through the campaign.
The Facebook records also pointed to Jake Sticka (COL ’13) as a membership in the Stewards. Sticka is outgoing GUSA chief of staff and Appelbaum’s campaign manager. That drew criticism from some of the candidates, including Ramadan, who apologized for his comments after admitting involvement in a secret society himself.
Appelbaum confirmed his membership in the Stewards when the news broke. Asked if he regretted the decision not to disclose his involvement, Appelbaum said he does not believe voters have a right to know if candidates are members in secret societies.
“My campaign is separate from the Stewards Society,” Appelbaum said. “It’s a private association of mine, just like any of the other candidates might have other private associations.”
Nonetheless, the secret society disclosures may have played a role in the election outcome. In the wake of the development, Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson (SFS ’14) and Joe Vandegriff (COL ’14) announced early Wednesday morning that they were no longer encouraging supporters to rank Appelbaum and Cleary No. 2 on their ballots. Corbin-Johnson had announced the cross-endorsement along with Appelbaum at the Monday presidential debate.
“We refuse to align ourselves publicly or privately with any members of an organization that lacks transparency and accountability at Georgetown,” Vandegriff said in a statement to The Hoya.
The Appelbaum ticket received 1,210 first-place votes compared to Tisa’s 1,187, yet runoff counts were initiated when no candidate had a majority of votes. The Tisa-Ramadan ticket won in the fourth and final round by a slim 108-vote margin.
Chief Steward of the Second Society Sam Schneider (COL ’13), who is co-director of the Student Advocacy Office and a former member of The Hoya’s Board of Directors, issued a statement Wednesday morning clarifying the nature of the society and commending Appelbaum’s honesty in revealing his affiliation.
“We communicate openly with the university administration when necessary and I am available to answer any questions at any time,” he wrote. “While the Society applauds … Appelbaum’s service to GUSA, the privilege belongs entirely to him. … Jack disclosed his membership, an aspect of his private life, at the very moment he was asked. His record of public service should be all that matters to any thoughtful person weighing the merits of his candidacy.”
Appelbaum’s running mate Maggie Cleary (COL ’14) said she learned of her membership when the ticket formed, but said she did not consider it a mitigating factor in their ability to lead Georgetown’s student body effectively.
Cleary said that she did not think the Stewards had given her campaign a disproportionate level of support compared to other student organizations, and she denied that the Stewards had influenced her ticket’s platform.
Tyler Sax (COL ’13), who was a presidential candidate in last year’s GUSA race, confirmed his membership in the Stewards but denied that the leak was significant to this year’s election.
“I think it tries to make a big issue out of something that’s not a big issue. It’s sort of sad to see someone would go to these lengths to make a big deal out of something,” Sax said.
Second Society of Stewards spokesman Russell Smith (COL ’98), whose name was noted on the tax filing posted by the Facebook user, declined to comment on the leak or the reaction on campus, but emphasized that all tax records leaked were public documents.
“We try to keep our affairs private. We, like a lot of groups, do a good job of that, but these things happen,” Smith said.
University spokeswoman Stacy Kerr declined to comment on the university’s policy regarding secret societies.

For students who become resident assistants, the free room and partial board and meal stipends are attractive perks. Yet these perks can come with a price tag, as RA benefits are deducted from the aid package given to those on financial aid.
Michelle Haines (SFS ’14) recently proposed a change to the university’s RA compensation policy on the Internet forum IdeaScale, which prompted a discussion between the student body and the Office of Financial Aid.
According to the Office of Student Financial Services, the value of these benefits is classified as an outside scholarship when determining an RAs’ financial aid packages. But for some, like RA Michael Raleigh (NHS ’15), the OSFS decision to cut his financial aid was problematic.
“My work-study award, which was $3,600, was taken away as a result of the RA position,” Michael Raleigh (NHS ’15) said. “This was the biggest shock to me. I had to search for a new job as my previous one with the Center for Social Justice only paid work-study students.”
Raleigh, who also holds a scholarship allowing him to pay 25 percent of full tuition, said he was forced to appeal his financial aid but still receives only a portion of the originally promised benefits.
In her IdeaScale post, Haines references Washington University in St. Louis, which changed its RA compensation policy in fall 2011. The university’s RAs are now designated as full employees, eliminating the position’s effect on their aid packages. Haines suggests that Georgetown follow suit.
Director of Residence Life Stephanie Lynch disagreed with Haines, stressing that the RA compensation package already provides sizable compensation, adding that the package adjusts accordingly for increases in housing costs.
“For the overwhelming majority of students, becoming an RA is a financial benefit,” Lynch said.
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh declined to comment on behalf of the Student Employment Office.
For some students, benefits are not the sole motivating force for accepting an RA position.
“The benefits offered with the position were a huge incentive to apply,” first-year RA Tucker Cholvin(SFS ’15) said. “[But] part of what motivated me to take the job was that I knew that I would make a pretty good RA and that it was work for which I felt I was well cut out.”
Raleighagreed, citing the importance of the RA experience.
“We are here to foster community and satisfy the needs of our residents, not to simply get free room and board,” Raleigh said.
But Haines, who declined to comment for this article, wrote in her post that due to RA compensation’s effect on financial aid, the Office of Residence Life fails to attract students of different socioeconomic levels.
Cholvin agreed, emphasizing that a change in compensation policy would attract a more diverse group of applicants.
“I think that this change is something that would advance [Residence Life]’s agenda and help them to live out their ideals,” Cholvin said. “We talk a lot about socioeconomic equality on campus, and this sort of policy is flatly to the contrary.”

Students, alumni and professors have banded together to petition Georgetown’s July decision to deny tenure to the School of Foreign Service’s assistant professor of Arab politics Samer Shehata.
Ebie DuPont (GRD ’06) created the petition, which she submitted to University President John J.DeGioia Feb. 11 with 255 signatures after learning of the university’s decision.
DuPont, who is based in Cairo, found out about the decision when she was visiting Washington in January and spoke to Shehata, who told her he was leaving Georgetown after being denied tenure in July and then unsuccessfully appealing the committee’s decision in September, learning of his second denial in November.
“He was denied tenure. People were shocked,” DuPont said. “He appealed it and had full support from the faculty.”
Several faculty members from the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies lent their support to Shehata’sappeal. Former CCAS Director Michael Hudson wrote a personal letter in response to Shehata’s denial.
Associate professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies at New York University Arang Keshavarziansaid he was upset by the committee’s decision to deny Shehata tenure.
“I was also saddened for my own field of Middle East politics that doesn’t support the type of original, refined research exhibited in Samer’s publication,” Keshavarzian said. “His scholarly work, in terms of his political engagements and his willingness to dialogue with journalists is admirable. Samer strove to offer a deep understanding of Egyptian politics to as broad an audience as possible. He has gone a long way in achieving this objective.”
“Denying Samer Shehata tenure is unjust and wrongheaded,” DuPont said. “It is an unbelievable judgment when you consider his record, which is superior on several levels to many other successful applicants in recent years.”
Among other accomplishments, Shehata was instrumental in establishing the Qatar Arabic Scholarship Program and the Qatar Postdoctoral Fellowship Program at CCAS.
“Together, both programs have brought hundreds of thousands of dollars to Georgetown and have created countless opportunities for students to critically engage with the Arab world,” Shehata said of his work.
Keshavarzian added that Shehata’s research was particularly significant in the wake of the Arab Spring.
In addition, Shehata emphasized his scholarly accomplishments outside of Georgetown.
“Because of my scholarship and expertise, I have frequently been asked to share my knowledge with senior U.S. government, World Bank and [International Monetary Fund] officials; civil society leaders, the policy community and the media,” Shehata said.
The petition stresses that Shehata’s work focuses on the contemporary Arab world, which is an explicit goal of CCAS in seeking to differentiate itself from other Middle East Studies programs.
DuPont pointed to Shehata’s proven excellence in teaching evaluations and student responses to his courses. According to DuPont, Shehata received an evaluation of 4.8 out of 5.0 in the ‘overall evaluation of instructor’ category for both “Egypt: Authoritarianism to Revolution” and “Contemporary Politics of the Middle East” in fall 2012.
“This was his score despite the stresses he has been going through for the last six months, having been rejected for tenure after more than a decade of service to the university and its students,” DuPont said.
Laci Barrow (GRD ’12) praised Shehata’s teaching and work.
“He has fantastic balance of scholarly, pedagogic and outreach,” she said. “His activities are so well balanced and in each of his activities he is so present and really engaging that its hard to find someone that has the combination of people skills and also teaching skills, pedagogic skills and who can also be representative of the university and can articulate political issues that the public can grasp.”
DuPont added that it is impossible to speculate on the reasons for the university’s denial because of the opacity of the tenure decision process.
“From my perspective, I can’t imagine the reason to deny him tenure. These decisions are not transparent.”
Graham Griffiths (GRD ’13) said losing Shehata will negatively impact the CCAS, which has been in a transition period.
“There has been quite a bit of turnover in the past couple of years, a couple of professors have left for retirement and other reasons and they’ve had difficulty hiring replacements to fill a couple people,” Griffiths said. “From a student perspective, its a lot of disruption to the center to have this high turnover of faculty, especially faculty like Professor Shehata.”
Diana Shin (GRD ’12) took two classes with Shehata and worked as his research assistant during the 2010-2011 academic year.
“I think he is a very dedicated teacher. He is the type of teacher who would Skype in while he was doing fieldwork monitoring parliamentary elections in Egypt for his classes here, and I don’t think many professors would do something like that,” she said. “He has done an incredible amount of service for CCAS and Georgetown. And just his name, ‘Samer Shehata,’ has been associated with CCAS for a decade now and just to lose that person is just a great loss for CCAS and for Georgetown.”
Shehata said that he was moved by the outreach from his students.
“I am extremely touched by the efforts of my former students and other Georgetown alumni,” Shehata said. “One of the great joys of teaching here has been the opportunity to interact with exceptionally bright students who are intellectually curious, hard-working, and deeply engaged in thinking about the world and its problems.”
Due to the privacy of tenure decisions, university officials declined to comment on the decision made by the committee.

Renleigh Spencer (COL ’15) excelled in high school. A natural scholar, he hoped to continue his academic achievements in college so that he could go on to earn a doctoral degree. But as the workload picked up, he would stay up for days in a row to finish a single assignment, sometimes not even finishing it because it did not measure up to his standard of perfection.
“I spent too much time thinking and not enough time doing — at least I know now, through therapy, that I have a problem. I know that I spend too much time and care on my work,” Spencer said. But his perfectionism was not just a product of excessive competitiveness but a manifestation of a learning disability, as well as other mental issues. Spencer first sought help from the Writing Center, which helped him focus a little but still left him unsatisfied with the quality of his work.
“I thought my writing skills were that of someone who just wasn’t able to formulate thoughts correctly,” he said. By his freshman spring, he was experiencing severe depression, some weeks lying in bed, catatonic, for a span of days.
“It got to the point where I just kind of gave up,” he said.
By the time he made an appointment with the Academic Resource Center, he had already finalized plans to take a leave of absence last fall. He is currently being tested for being autistic and manic depressive. He identifies himself as disabled and not neurotypical — a person whose brain functions in a way considered “normal” by society. Still on leave, he said he feels taken care of by his family and friends back home but that the support system Georgetown offers leaves room for improvement.
“I’m not blaming Georgetown for anything, and Georgetown is doing the best they can within their means,” he said.
Yet Spencer believes something could have prevented him falling through system’s cracks.
“I feel like there needs to be a more open line of communication between disabled students and the ARC, and disabled students need to feel as though they can advocate for themselves,” Spencer said. “Nobody is really talking to the student.”
In Spencer’s case, emails in his inbox piled up during his days of depression. Phone calls went unanswered.
“I didn’t really know how to express I wasn’t OK,” Spencer said in reference to his bipolar disorder. “We need to be aggressive in our self-advocacy.”
But “coming out” as autistic can be difficult in a culture dominated by perfectionism that perpetuates aneurotypical and able-bodied set of norms. Spencer said he encountered stigma against those with autism — whether being treated as a “problem” or solely in an academic context that ignored the individual.
Such bias against disabled people on the basis of their disabilities, whether they are physically visible or invisible, is known as ableism.
“Autism is not a problem; it’s just something that exists,” Spencer said. “People treat it like an academic issue when it’s not an academic issue — it’s a cultural issue. We’re being treated like science projects.”
He feels like dialogue is the best way to combat ableism, but also thinks that it involves able-bodied and neurotypical people being respectful of disabled students’ space.
“Mental health has not been integrated into our philosophy of education,” Spencer said.
Similarly, former student Izzi Angel agreed that Georgetown’s environment does not foster a healthy attitude towards disability.
“I feel like for me personally, the culture of perfection and the rampant ableism that goes along with that really inhibited me from getting the help I needed or admitting to people that I needed help,” Angel said. “By the time I did ask for help, it was because things were kind of already in crisis mode.”
Angel entered Georgetown in the fall of 2009 at the age of 17, already with a handful of credits under her belt from Northern Virginia Community College.
“My first year at NOVA, I had a 4.0 and everything was going swimmingly, [and] then I came to Georgetown and it was just completely different,” she said.
As a transfer student younger than the average freshman, Angel felt that the care she received from Resident Advisors or Orientation Advisors was not on par with that offered to first-time students.
“They assume you’ve been to college [and] you know what you’re doing. And in terms of what I needed as a 17-year-old, that wasn’t exactly it,” she said.
She made her first appointment at Counseling and Psychiatric Services before final exams in the fall semester. Her counsellor determined she was experiencing test anxiety, but Angel did not feel such a diagnosis was accurate. She took a leave of absence beginning in the fall of 2010, and during that period, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which she identifies as a disability.
“One of the things that I was struggling with was anxiety — particularly centered around writing papers — that would just spiral out of control,” Angel said. “I didn’t feel comfortable going to the Writing Center because it was my peers and because I didn’t want to admit how much trouble I was having. … I didn’t want to be seen as crazy or stupid.”
Angel sees ableism as part and parcel of the culture on campus.
“Even just in terms of the way people talk — ‘I’m not crazy. I’m not stupid. You’re crazy. You’re stupid’ — or the way people are treated when they are labeled as ‘crazy’ or ‘stupid,’” she said of the attitudes she perceived while on the Hilltop. “People act differently toward you at best, or they try to ignore it.”
Angel reflected that she perceived the campus as a whole inaccessible in spite of the proclaimed mission of cura personalis.
“Because everyone, not only students but also faculty and staff, is so focused on achievements and just getting to the finish line first, there’s not a lot of care taken for what might happen on the way to the finish line,” Angel said.
If her time at CAPS was brief, Angel’s interaction with the Academic Resource Center was briefer still. She said she knew the center existed but was not aware of its ability to accommodate students with psychological disabilities.
An office within the division of Student Affairs, the ARC provides academic support for all students, including those with disabilities or facing academic challenges.
“I think is important for people to realize that our primary focus is with students,” Jane Holahan, director of the center, said. “So when you think about it, the academic resource center has a similar mission to [Center for Multicultural and Equality Access], the LGBTQ center, where we are an advocacy office as well.”
In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, ARC strives to accommodate disabled students in a way that puts them on a level playing field with their peers.
“There’s a range of accommodations. There are some students who do not need classroom accommodations — their accommodation may just be that they need accessible paths,” Holohan said.
Often, the ARC will refer students to CAPS, a separate office also within Student Affairs. However, thecounselling services are under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act medical privacy laws, so ARC advisers are not legally allowed to check in with CAPS to see if a student followed through with an appointment.
“That confidentiality needs to be preserved. And I’ll be honest with you: I treat students as young adults,” Holohan said. “I’m going to say this is the student’s responsibility. They have a choice to make, and if they believe that going to CAPS is not in their best interest, that’s their choice.”
Holohan noted that students can grant the ARC permission to communicate with their counsellor at the center.
But Angel feels the outcome of her college career could have been different if the overall structure of Georgetown’s support network better accommodated disabled students.
“I feel like if the culture was different, if there were more resources, if the resources were better known, if the resources were more useful, if the resources weren’t stigmatized — like glancing over your shoulder when you’re coming out of CAPS,” Angel said.
Disagreeing with claims that ableism exists at Georgetown, Holohan argued that the community is one of understanding, not intolerance.
“Are some people feeling that people with disabilities are being looked down upon? That people are being discriminated against? I don’t see that,” Holohan said. “I will say that in respect to the individuals who might see that, that’s a perception they have, and I have to respect that perception.”
Holohan noted that even as a person without a disability, she shares the perspective with those who do.
“As somebody who grew up with a brother with a significant disability, I do understand … discrimination,” Holohan said. “I understand how people gawked at my brother when he was out in public. I understand the feelings you get when you see that happening.”
She said that she does not detect such ableism on campus.
Holohan contends that the center works within its power to accommodate students, provided they make the first step.
“One thing I have discovered at Georgetown … [is] the students who are proactive and not afraid to speak up in a way that [says,] ‘These are the difficulties I’m having’ — those are the ones we can really help out,” she said. “But people who are reactive or shutting down or not giving us the information, there’s not much we can do to help them out.”
Holohan described the center as a small but extremely busy office, seeing some students once a week and others only once a semester, depending on their respective needs. Whitney Weldon (COL ’15) said that the office would benefit from additional resources.
“Due to the large amount of students who go to the ARC, they should maybe have two other people working in the department so they can be more flexible about meetings and such when needed,” Weldon said.
Overall, Weldon thinks the lack of resources devoted to disability access poses the greatest challenge to students.
“I think it’s unfortunate that the school has limited resources and funding to provide the small challenges a disabled person has,” Weldon said.
Weldon has a rare bone disease, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, that makes walking difficult for her, so she uses a wheelchair for faster and safer transportation across campus. Although many campus buildings’ doors are automatic, Weldon cannot extend her arm to press the button to open them.
“In order for me to be independent, my dad donated money to Georgetown to be able to have all of the buildings accessible by a key fob,” she said.
Holohan noted that physical barriers were of great concern for her and that the ARC works with facilities management when blue buttons for the automatic doors are broken. She said many students do not realize that when they kick or jam the button, it can break the door, hindering the mobility of those that depend on it.
“By the time I graduate, I would love to have transformed Georgetown to be very accessible so other disabled students can succeed despite physical challenges,” Weldon said.
Angel’s decision to transfer after last semester came after two and a half years of struggling at a place she did not feel provided all her needs. Not all disabled students at Georgetown decide to leave, though they face challenges nonetheless.
Lydia Brown (COL ’15), who is autistic and a vocal advocate for disabled people, considered leaving the university. Some of her family members discouraged her from returning to Georgetown after her first year.
“I had thoughts about just dropping out of college altogether because I was feeling useless, as though being in the university environment wasn’t conducive to my well-being — that things were unchangeable,” she said.
Just last week, one of her professors suggested she transfer to a different school — one that was less challenging academically. The professor even reminded Brown of the upcoming deadline for transferring.
“I don’t know if we would have been having that conversation if I were not disabled,” Brown said.
Just like any undergraduate student, Brown admits that balancing academics and extracurriculars is trying at times, but she has no plans to leave.
“As much as there are things about this school that I find fundamentally problematic — and sometimes outright hostile — that I’d love to see changed, I feel adamantly that it is far more important for me to be here so that I could potentially be a part of effecting change — as well asbenefitting from the many positive aspects of being a part of this university,” she said. “I want to be a part of this community.”
Spencer is similarly undeterred from accomplishing his goal of coming back to the Hilltop after his leave of absence. He plans on returning next fall and being part of the conversation of ableism on campus — a complex situation that deserves a complex discussion, he said.
“I’m definitely coming back,” Spencer said. “I’m getting a degree from Georgetown and it’s going to be on my wall and I’m going to be proud of it.”

Rebecca Goldberg/The HoyaNate Tisa and Adam Ramadan embraced after winning the GUSA presidency and vice presidency early Friday morning.Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) were elected president and vice president of the GUSA executive yesterday, finishing just 92 votes ahead in the final round of runoff voting despite trailing in the initial stages.
“We are beyond thrilled to serve the student body and make Georgetown a better place,” said Tisa, who ran as a presidential candidate in the 2012 Georgetown University Student Association executive election and currently serves as speaker of the GUSA senate. “It shows the faith a lot of people have in us that we have the capability of actually accomplishing what students wanted.”
Tisa and Ramadan trailed Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) and Maggie Cleary (COL ’14) 1,210 to 1,187 in the first round of counting, but overtook first place in the fourth round and achieved a majority after alternate choices from the other candidates’ votes were distributed.
A total of 3,733 ballots were cast in the election, surpassing last year’s total 3,697 ballots and marking a record high turnout rate for any GUSA vote.
The results of the election, which were released round by round on Twitter by the GUSA Election Commission between 12:42 and 12:51 a.m. Friday, mirrored a poll that The Hoya conducted last Tuesday, in which Tisa and Ramadan tied with Appelbaum and Cleary, both tickets scoring 20.5 percent of likely voters among the 793 students polled.
Tisa and Ramadan, whose platform advocates for expanding free-speech zones, combating sexual assault on campus and establishing gender-neutral housing, received endorsement from H*yas for Choice, GU Pride, The Voice and Hoya Blue.
“We are going to get started on our platform tomorrow morning as soon as we wake up. Students have shown that they know we care about diversity, care about free speech and sexual assault, and we will push through our platforms for the entire next 12 months,” Tisa said.
Appelbaum and Cleary maintained a lead of 19 through the third round of voting.
Shavonnia Corbin Johnson (SFS ’14) and Joe Vandegriff (COL ’14) received 758 first-round votes, while their supporters’ alternate votes played a deciding role in the election.
Corbin Johnson and Vandegriff had endorsed Appelbaum and Cleary as a second choice for their supporters, but retracted this endorsement after news of Appelbaum’s membership in the Second Society of Stewards broke early Wednesday morning.
After the results were announced, Vandegriff said platform similarities between his ticket and Tisa’s influenced his supporters.
“[Tisa and Ramadan] support making campus a more progressive place, which is near and dear to my heart. I really hope they stay true to that,” Vandegriff said. “That may be a reason why people supported them. There’s a lot of the same focus.”
Appelbaum said he did not come to any conclusions about the election’s results during the first or second round of voting.
“I had no clue what to expect. I was not in any place thinking we had it in any of those first rounds. I knew it would come down to where Shavonnia and Joe’s votes were redistributed,” Appelbaum said.
Appelbaum said he did not believe news of his membership in the Stewards greatly affected the outcome of the election.
“It came at an unfortunate time,” Appelbaum said. “But I’m prepared to answer for it at any time. I’m not ashamed of it and I’m proud of how we stood up for it.”
Ramadan also admitted to membership in a secret society unaffiliated with the Second Society of Stewards Wednesday night after initially denying affiliation with a secret society Tuesday. Ramadan also said he did not believe his membership or initial denial affected the election.
“At the end of the day, people know that Nate and I care about this place, and that’s what matters and that we want to make Georgetown a better place, whether it be through organizations that nobody talks about or organizations that everybody knows about,” Ramadan said.
Current GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), who had endorsed Appelbaum and Cleary in this race, showed up at Tisa and Ramadan’s campaign party to congratulate the duo.
“I think it was a very long, very well fought campaign. I think Nate and Adam will do a great job and they will be able to recruit a lot of different people to be involved in GUSA that haven’t been before, which I think is very exciting,” Gustafson said.
Corbin Johnson and Vandegriff wished Tisa and Ramadan well in office. Vandegriff said he believed Tisa benefitted in this race from having already experienced a GUSA campaign cycle, as did Cleary, who ran as a vice presidential candidate in 2012.
Spencer Walsh (MSB ’14) and Rob Silverstein (SFS ’14), the only ticket without GUSA experience, finished in fourth place with 366 first-place votes.
“Given our cross endorsement with Nate and Adam, we are especially excited to see a candidate who shares our values chosen to lead GUSA,” Walsh wrote in a statement. “Rob and I hope to work with Nate and Adam on the many issues where we agreed during the campaign.”
Cannon Warren (SFS’14) and Andrew Logerfo (COL’14) finished with 175 votes in the first round of voting.
“I just feel like my main constituency didn’t come out. “I’m still going to work toward advocating toward students. … Tyrannical dictator Nate Tisa won’t stop me,” said Warren, who has gained a reputation for humorous statements during the campaign.
Tisa will be the first openly gay president of the Georgetown University Student Association and the second at a major Jesuit university. The first was elected to the University of San Francisco in 2003.
“As the first gay president at this university, I am going to Catholic [University], going to American [University], I’m going to tell them, this is the 21st century and they have absolutely no reason to deny the fact there are gay students here who deserve representation and deserve a voice in student government,” Tisa said.
Tisa and Ramadan will be sworn in to their new roles March 16.

Universities and publishers are closely following a court case regarding the copyright policies of electronic course reserves — academic documents that have been catalogued online — that is awaiting trial in the U.S. Court of Appeals.
In 2008, Cambridge University Press, Oxford University Press and SAGE Publications filed a lawsuit against Georgia State University. The plaintiffs allege that Georgia State violated copyright law by allowing some of the publishers’ content to be used in e-reserves without license.
Judge Orinda Dale Evans of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ruled in favor of Georgia State in 2011, stating that the university only violated publishers’ copyrights by going over the amount of e-reserves considered fair use in five of 99 cases. The publishers, however, wanted another trial, and their motion for appeal has been granted.
Georgetown students encounter e-reserves, also known as online reserves, every day when professors post scanned articles on Blackboard.
According to Laura Leichum, intellectual property manager for the Georgetown University Press, there are varying regulations for e-reserve access.
“Usually, the rule is only people in that class can view the material,” said Laura Leichum, intellectual property manager for the Georgetown University Press.
The press publishes about 40 books and two journals a year that are primarily aimed at scholars, according to its website.
Mark Muehlhaeusler, head of the department of copyright and digital rights management for Georgetown University Library, does not believe the case will ultimately have much effect on academic practices at Georgetown.
“When the first judgment came down, we looked at it very carefully to see if there were [risks]. Georgetown is very careful, inherently risk-averse,” Muehlhaeusler said, adding that Georgetown makes use of e-reserves very differently than does Georgia State.
According to Muehlhaeusler, the university tries to use e-reserves sparingly and only for pertinent material whereas other schools may utilize the documents as often as possible.
Although the case may not greatly impact Georgetown, Evans’s ruling clarified that only ten percent of a book can legally be used in any reserve system.
“The case clarifies what is fair use [and] it makes it easier to make that determination on a day-to-day basis,” Muehlhaeusler said.
Both Leichum and Muehlhaeusler said they believe the publishers’ efforts to enforce copyright regulation is not only motivated by financial reasoning, but also by the desire to preserve academic integrity.
“Copyright is not there to protect the explicit interests of the publisher,” Muehlhaeusler said. “It’s [there] to stimulate creative expression,”
Ultimately, both educators and publishers want people to be able to access academic content.
“We’d like to have everyone use this material. There’s a common goal,” Leichum said.

Georgetown professor and former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) has likely secured enough Senate votes to be confirmed as the next secretary of defense after Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) announced his support of the nominee.
Shelby’s vote will be the last of the 60 needed to end the Republican filibuster of Hagel’s nomination that began last week.
The GOP has criticized Hagel for what it perceives as his weak support of Israel, his conciliatory stance on Iran and his opposition to the Iraq War.
Among the senators supporting Hagel are all 55 Democrats and five Republicans. In addition to Shelby, the Republicans who have announced their support of Hagel are Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), MikeJohanns (R-Neb.), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Ark.).
With no filibuster, the Senate can move forward on Hagel’s confirmation vote, which could take place as soon as Wednesday. Confirmation requires a simple majority.
If confirmed, Hagel will succeed current Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.

A District of Columbia Taxicab Commission panel recommended that all D.C. cabs be painted red in a public meeting Feb. 13, adding to regulations that include a 2012 proposal mandating standardized dome lights on city taxis.
“Red is a color that is associated with the District, both among residents and visitors,” the DCTC’s One-Color Panel said in its recommendation statement. The four-person panel cited the District’s flag, the city’s sports teams, the Circulator buses and Capital Bikeshare as examples of the color’s prevalence throughout the city.
If the proposal is accepted after the full commission considers it in March, cab drivers will have to switch over to red when they replace their vehicles upon reaching their service limit, which depends on age and mileage. The drivers will be responsible for the costs of painting the car red.
According to D.C Taxicab Commission Public Information Officer Neville Waters (MBA ’91), the standardized dome lights, which are now in the proposed rulemaking stage, would have LED lights to demonstrate taxis’ availability and feature a four-digit vehicle identification number.
“It will enable passengers, if they have a problem, to see that four-digit number and notify us to lodge a complaint,” Waters said.
While Waters is hopeful that the dome lights could be installed by the spring or the early summer, he said the complete transition to red cabs would take about five years.
The uniform color scheme has been met with resistance by many cab companies.
“We oppose the one color scheme,” Yellow Cab Company of D.C General Manager Roy Spooner said. “Our colors are part of our brand. That’s how people recognize our company and our cabs on the street, by our color scheme.”
Spooner distinguishes the color change from other cab reforms that he says benefit customers.
“Changing your color doesn’t improve service,” Spooner said. “We already do GPS, credit card, apps and all these different things and that’s how you improve service, not by changing the color of the cab.”
Other cab company representatives agree. 
“We will mourn the disappearance of our unique color scheme,” Diamond Cab Dispatcher Nathan Harris said.
Cab drivers have voiced protests as well, especially over the cost of repainting their cabs themselves.
“It is completely ludicrous and will cost drivers extremely large amounts of money with no return,” Yellow Cab driver Nathan Price said. “I have had the same colors for 40 years, and I don’t understand the need of [the change].”
Price’s cab is a 2002 model that he says will have to be off the streets by about 2015. He estimates that the cost of the mandated improvements, which also include installing a smart meter, will be about $40,000.
“In June of 2008 to May of 2012, we operated on a minimum of 25 to a max of 40 percent deficit in income, so how can drivers all of a sudden afford to put out $40,000?” he said.
Price called the legislation “economical genocide.”
“I own my cab now, but the way they have things set up, I don’t know how much longer I will be able to own it,” he said.
Price feels that the work of taxi drivers is not being appreciated.
“These drivers have given all these years of public service to the district and in return they’re forcing you to do something that is almost financially impossible.”
The one-color scheme was motivated by a number of reasons, including having a color distinctly linked to the District and distinguishing legal cabs, according to Waters.  
Students generally approve of the one-color scheme.
“It will be easier to distinguish the cabs and you will see them coming from a further distance,” Maddie Gallo (NHS ’16) said. “It will make travel easier.”
Others said that the red cabs would help improve safety.
“Sometimes I feel threatened getting into a cab if I’m not familiar with its appearance,” Manavi Bhagwat (SFS ’16) said. “The uniform color will add to the legitimacy and will help students feel safer when taking cab rides.”
Nonetheless, Waters acknowledged that the dome lights would have a greater effect on modernizing the fleet and making them more visible to users.
“I expect that over the next couple of years we will have a modern fleet and hopefully people will be saying that the D.C. cab industry is one of the best in the world,” he said.

The Woodstock Theological Center will close June 30 after serving as a home for Jesuit-informed research and reflection at Georgetown since 1973.
Woodstock Center Director Fr. Gasper LoBiondo, S.J., said the decision was finalized in early January by the Jesuit Provincials of the Maryland, New York and New England Provinces, who own the ministry, which is independent from the university. The closure was not publicly announced, however, until Feb. 15.
LoBiondo said a lack of Jesuit staff and a dearth of options for leadership replacement was one of the main reasons for the center’s shuttering.
“This is a Jesuit center, and in order to keep it a strictly Jesuit center, there had to be some Jesuits here,” he said. “There just aren’t enough.”  
The lack of manpower for Woodstock is partly due to the presence of Jesuit seminaries at Boston College and Santa Clara University. Because both centers are involved in training young Jesuits, they have priority in obtaining personnel.
Director of the Woodstock Theological Center Library Fr. J. Leon Hooper, S.J., confirmed the inability to find new leadership for the center as an additional cause for its closing.
“The youngest guy [at the center] is 68 now,” Hooper said. “We began to recognize that we needed some younger leadership for, if nothing else, the energy but also for dealing with more contemporary problems.”
While several of the center’s employees and fellows will be absorbed into university positions, placement for some has yet to be determined as the center is still in a transitional period.
Woodstock Fellow Fr. Thomas Michel, S.J., will go to the School of Foreign Service in Qatar, while Matthew Gladden, associate director for programs, administration and finance, has been hired by the psychology department.
Hooper also added that the center has been under financial pressure for some time. According to Hooper, the center’s staff was reduced last year to conserve funds, and closure had been considered for the past year and a half.
The university-funded Woodstock Center Library, which is located on the bottom level of Lauinger Library, will continue its operations as a leading source of Jesuit letters, reports and other written work. Although the Jesuits of New York and Maryland Provinces also own the collection, Georgetown has agreed to fund new acquisitions, allowing the library to remain open.
While current research — from business ethics to the church’s political involvement — funneled through the center will come to a close, past research will be preserved, and the mission of many fellows will continue without the center.
According to Rev. Raymond Kemp, a fellow at the Woodstock Center and a theology professor, the research conducted in the past has been in the process of digitalization over the last few years, and many of the center’s issues will continue to be addressed on campus.
“Those [research] items are going to be on my agenda forever,” he said. “I think they are items that are going to be on the agendas of a lot of people here at Georgetown.”
Kemp added, however, that the center’s closing signals the termination of what was once a vibrant institution.
“I do think it’s the end of an era, when we were flush with Jesuits and we had a lot of theologians that were ready to think through these issues,” he said. “I don’t think we’ll die. I think we’re going to morph — a different kind of phoenix will rise from the ashes.”

Although the District of Columbia’s mayoral race is more than a year away, Councilman Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) has already announced his intention to run for the city’s highest office.
Evans, who represents the Georgetown area in city council, has not yet filed any official paperwork but iterated to The Hoya that he would be a candidate for the Nov. 4, 2014 election.
The councilman is a mainstay in city government, having served on the D.C. Council since 1991. This Monday, he became the District’s longest-serving councilmember.
But throughout his lengthy career in local politics, Evans has only run for mayor on one other occasion, in 1998. Although he was ultimately unsuccessful in his 1998 bid — placing third in the Democratic primary behind eventual Mayor Anthony Williams and former Councilman Kevin Chavous (D-Ward 7) — Evans said he has learned valuable lessons from that campaign.
“A mayor’s race is a long marathon, and it’s time consuming and very tiring,” Evans said. “You have to be prepared and ready for it and just go out and be honest and truthful with the voters. If you can do that, you can have a good chance of success.”
Since 1998, Evans has seen his popularity grow, receiving 65 percent or more of the vote in each of his city council elections since then. Last year he easily won reelection, running unopposed in the primary and general election.
“People know who I am, and I have a long — and I think very good — record,” Evans said. “Some people would disagree with some of the positions I’ve taken, and I recognize that going in [to the race].”
In the fifteen years since his last run, however, the political campaign season has gotten longer. In 1998, Evans waited until May of the election year to announce his candidacy. This time around, Evans began to lay the groundwork for his campaign more than two years beforehand and began talking to potential financial backers in summer 2012.
The change is in part because of a new federal requirement that moved the primary up from September to April, lengthening the campaign by five months. According to WRC-TV, NBC’s Washington affiliate, petitions to be on the primary ballot could be available as early as this December.
The early mayoral bid announcements also come after alleged campaign corruption in Mayor Vincent Gray’s 2010 run for D.C.’s highest position. Shortly after accusations of finance misdeeds surfaced in 2011-2012, several councilmembers, including Evans, were rumored by The Washington Post to be considering throwing their hats into the mayoral ring. While Evans was critical of Gray in 2011, his opinion has changed since then.
“I’ve known him 30 years,” Evans said of Gray. “I think he’s doing a good job as mayor. He’s somebody I work with closely, and so I have a lot of respect for him.”
The councilman faced controversy himself when he was accused Nov. 2011 by fellow Ward 2 candidate Fiona Greig of intimidating her to drop out of the city council race.
In the mayoral race, however, Evans is not alone in his ambition for the city’s top office. One of his potential opponents, Councilman Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), announced Feb. 4 that he is forming an exploratory committee to examine a mayoral bid.
One thing that has not changed since 1998 is that if Evans wins, he will be the District’s first white mayor.
“City’s changed. Country’s changed. Attitudes have changed,” Evans said. “I think people are more interested in someone who’s a qualified, good mayor — someone that they believe can get things done, who has a good track record — than what color they are.”
As representative of an area that includes both Georgetown and The George Washington University, Evans recognizes the importance of interacting with the two universities.
“I make it a routine of speaking at Georgetown and George Washington at least once or twice a year, whenever there’s an opportunity to do something,” Evans said. “We just ran an April [democratic primary] election when I ran for reelection last year, and reaching out to the students was one of the things I did then and will continue to do now.”
However, Evans has previously cancelled commitments to come and speak at Georgetown, such as when he cancelled a planned appearance in 2011.
After this cancellation, Georgetown University College Democrats struggled to get in touch with his office to reschedule.
“Historically, we have had a difficult time scheduling with his office,” GUCD President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said.
After not receiving any contact from Evans’s office, Tezel said he heard back months later after sending the councilman a tweet.
“Some of his statements that he has made in the past regarding students have been unfortunate,” Tezel said. “He seems to have a general interest in the concerns of students in D.C., but I think we need to see more from him in his campaign before there’s any kind of organized support for him [from college students].”
Evans was also critical of Georgetown’s campus plan in a January 2011 column from local paper The Georgetowner, writing that the university needed to house all of its students on campus.
“Even if students who live off campus in our neighborhood are well-behaved, it is too much of a strain on residents,” Evans wrote. “When you have houses and tenants that are not well-behaved, the burden becomes impossible.”
However, Evans said he does not foresee any change in his priorities for the Georgetown area if he were to be elected mayor.
“Picking up the trash, trimming the trees, making sure the street lights work, fixing the potholes, sidewalks — basic services that every person in the city wants,” Evans said. “They want to make sure that the neighborhood is safe during the day and night, that there’s enough of a police presence — all of that. Those are the basic issues, and then beyond that, much of Georgetown has been taken care of.”

When Reza Handley-Namavar (MSB ’12) fell ill in the middle of the night during his junior semester abroad in South Africa, he was utterly alone. Without access to a cell phone or computer, he couldn’t call for help, research his symptoms or consult a doctor. This experience inspired him to launch Dream Mobile, a start-up company offering a cheaper smartphone alternative, which is based in South Africa and staffed by fellow Class of 2012 Georgetown graduates.
“If something had seriously gone wrong, I would have been in a lot of trouble,” he said. “I realized that if I had had a smartphone, I could have … actually gotten help instead of suffering through the night until I was able to reach a doctor in the morning.”
Handley-Namavar founded the for-profit social enterprise in February 2011 to develop affordable smartphones and provide low-cost access to data to the African population. He then moved to Cape Town after graduating last spring, while three of his Georgetown classmates, Gwen Schwartz (COL ’12), Benjamin McAfee (SFS ’12) and Odosa Aghayere (MSB ’12),  ran the company’s U.S. team.
Dream Mobile’s phones, which come with data-blocking software that allows users to designate specifics essential data to use the data network to reduce the cost of data plans, were developed through a Chinese manufacturer using the Android software.
“Some can’t afford to have the phone using data all the time, if the phone is just updating in the background,” he said. “If they’re just using Whatsapp, they can afford to keep data on.”
By focusing on just the African market, Dream Mobile can develop technology specially tailored to African needs through enhanced Bluetooth sharing and anti-theft apps.
Dream Mobile received its first shipment of 100 phones last week. It will be sold to a local pizza service that is developing a digital communication system for deliveries. Its business model has evolved from focusing on the youth and consumer market, to working with small- and medium-sized businesses.
However, the team has come a long way since last year, McAfee said.
“Back then we didn’t have a logo, we didn’t have the phones that we have now, we didn’t have a solid business structure [and] we didn’t have a team. There were just many things that weren’t even there,” he said. “Where we are right now with our company … is a lot stronger. We’re able to sort of understand what we’re doing a lot more than we’re used to.”
Dream Mobile is also proud of its commitment to employing South African students.
“We’re creating structures to decrease the unemployment in South Africa, because we employ youth … to teach them how to run as business as well as provide an income,” McAfee said.
Handley-Namavar’s foremost business goal is further growth throughout Africa. He is currently working with a team to expand into Ghana, in addition to making preliminary connections in other African countries.
“My dream 10 years from now is that when I get into a minibus taxi or go into any public space, I see a third to a half of the people using a Dream Mobile phone, at least in Africa,” he said.
Despite the risk and responsibility involved, Handley-Namavar thinks the decision to launch the company was the right one.
“In a lot of ways, what I’m doing as an entrepreneur is a lot harder … because everything’s on you. The company goes forward when I work; the company stalls when I stop working. It’s the same for the rest of the team,” he said. “But there’s nothing I would rather be doing with my life right now than what I’m doing.”

In the latest development of the criminal case against Epicurean and Co. proprietor Chang Wook Chon, a status hearing will be held March 7, as was decided in Tuesday’s hearing.
Chon pled not guilty in November to the charge of criminal contempt for violating a court order issued during a 2010 civil lawsuit filed by four Epicurean employees who claimed Chon did not fully compensate them for overtime work. Following the plea, the jury trial was set for Feb. 12, though status hearings and motions have delayed the trial’s start date.
A status hearing is an intermediary step before a trial during which lawyers from each side update the judge. During such hearings, the trial can set another status hearing, announce a plea agreement or determine an official trial date if an agreement is unreachable. Additional status hearings are only held if there is sufficient evidence that the case is moving toward a plea agreement.
Barry Coburn of Coburn and Greenbaum represents Chon, while U.S. attorney Patricia Stewart heads the prosecution team. Coburn and Stewart declined to comment because the case is still pending, though Bill Miller, spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s office, said that there were no new developments in the case.

David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush and former Wall Street Journal editorial board member, said that the Republican Party is well positioned to adapt to the 21st century in a Tuesday address.
Frum is founder of the FrumForum — a site dedicated to the modernization of the Republican Party — and is a featured writer at The Daily Beast and Newsweek.
Frum said that in order to gain broader support throughout the country, the Republican Party must change its message.
“The message in the last election was … for entrepreneurs, but most people aren’t entrepreneurs and don’t like economic risk,” Frum said. “You have to have a message for them and the message has to be one of respect — you cannot divide your population between makers and takers.”
According to Frum, for these reasons, the Republican candidate in 2024 will stand for different positions than Republican candidates today.
“In 2024 will a Republican candidate be for or against same-sex marriage? For,” Frum said. “In 2024 will the Republican candidate have something to say about climate change? Yes. In 2024 will the Republican candidate say that if a 10-year-old boy finds a gun and shoots his 8-year-old sister, that there is nothing that anybody in government needs to say or do about that tragedy? I don’t believe that will happen.”
Albert Eisenberg (COL ’13) questioned Frum about the benefit of shifting positions and cited former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was admired for standing firmly to her principles.
In response, Frum said that Thatcher’s principles were relevant to the situation of her time, whereas Republicans today face a different situation.
“The Republican Party has a tremendous problem telling the difference between principles and policies,” Frum said. “Women in government is a principle. The Ryan Plan is not a principle. The Republican Party has had tremendous difficulty [in recent years] applying its principles to reality.”
Frum said that the he was confident that his party would overcome the challenges it faces.
“In every developed country in the world there is a party of the left and a party of the right,” Frum said. “A party that is of markets and enterprise and a party about social services and public sector. Someone needs to be there to stand up for the people who pay the bills that create enterprises and drive innovation and growth. We need a party that stands up for a lighter hand of regulation for balancing budgets over the longer term and for making sure the tax burden isn’t crushing.”
Frum said he was optimistic about the party’s ability to build support as it adapts.
“The sheer competitive dynamic of the two-party system will force the Republican Party to retool,” Frum said. “You can see the beginnings of conversation — [change] is a matter of time.”
The event was sponsored by the Georgetown University College Republicans.
“Frum was an entertaining, stimulating and engaging speaker,” College Republicans Chair Alex Cave (COL ’15) said. “Students of all political persuasions, not just Republicans, turned out for the event. … I think that people who attended the event, even those who may not agree with Frum’s perspective, really enjoyed listening to and participating in what was a very dynamic discussion.”

The Program for Jewish Civilization’s three-day “Secularism on the Edge” conference addressed misconceptions about secularism Wednesday through Friday.
The conference included public interviews, panels and presentations covering topics ranging from women and secularism to Israeli religious secularism.
PJC Director Jacques Berlinerblau said that a common misconception, especially among Catholics, is that all secularists are atheists.
“Catholics haven’t always hated secularism. When they see that it can protect them, they embrace it,” Berlinerblau said. “As a premier research university, Georgetown has welcomed this discussion and research.”
Secularism is more of a political philosophy than a religious one, according to Berlinerblau. The opening event Wednesday was a public interview with Berlinerblau, in which he and Messiah College associate professor of history John Fea debated whether America is a secular or Christian nation.
Fea discussed the ways different interest groups — from the Christian right to secularists to the Christian left — have used historic documents to justify their views that America was founded as either a Christian or secular nation.
Fea said that the Declaration of Independence is dated “In the Year of Our Lord,” a fact that has been used to argue America’s founding as a Christian nation. However, Fea said that the line was simply added to the document by a clerk after the committee was dismissed.
However, Fea said that the first article of the 1796 Treaty of Tripoli stated that “the United States is not, in any sense, founded as a Christian nation.”
Secularists have often used this line as evidence against a religious origin for America, but Fea said it is necessary to be wary of the treaty because, at the time, Americans were attempting to stand on neutral grounds with Muslim Tripolitania.
“If you’re going to make an argument that America is not a Christian nation, I think you need to be cautious when using the Treaty of Tripoli, because it’s so easy to take this thing out of context,” Fea said.
People who believe America was founded as a Christian nation have unfavorable opinions of secularism, according to Fea.
“They think of aggressive atheists who have a particular agenda to try to remove anything related to religion from public life,” Fea said.
Fea also said he appreciated how this conference is working to redefine secularism. Fea is an evangelical Christian, but said he is also secular.
“My faith as an evangelical requires me to try to win you to Christ,” Fea said. “My desire would be to evangelize you and have you become a believer. Now, I don’t believe the state should be doing that. But I think in conversations over coffee, I want to talk about my faith.”
Laura Kurek (SFS ’16) valued the talk’s objective approach.
“I thought it was a very educated discussion,” Laura Kurek (SFS ’16) said. “I liked how it was historical. Fea did a good job at not letting his personal views detract from the topic at hand.”
Ann Yang (SFS ’15) agreed with Kurek.
“As a liberal, minority Christian, I am often uncomfortable with the Christian right,” she said. “This discussion was enlightening. It was refreshing to see that there’s a body of scholars who holds my views.”
Fea concluded by saying he was hopeful for a secular American future.
“I’m happy working with people of all faiths or no faiths at all to promote the common good,” he said. “We don’t need to have a Christian nation in order to live faithfully in the world.”
The BMW Center for German and European Studies, the Department of French and the Department of Government co-sponsored the event, along with the PJC.

The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, which will analyze women’s contributions to peace-building and train future leaders in the process, officially launched Wednesday with a commemorative ceremony in Lohrfink Auditorium.
The launch ceremony began with a video featuring former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who announced the institute’s formation in December 2011. President John J. DeGioia, School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster and recently appointed director of the center, former Clinton aide and ambassador-at-large Melanne Verveer (FLL ’66, G ’69) also spoke.
“For years, many of us have tried to show the world that women are not just victims of war — they are agents of peace,” Clinton said in the video. “I am delighted by the announcement of [DeGioia] and [Lancaster] about Georgetown’s leadership. There couldn’t be a better institution to lead the way in the academic work that is necessary around these issues.”
Following the video, Lancaster said that since 2011, the institute has formed an online research repository, filmed oral histories, consulted the university and begun determining areas of critical research. The institute will also launch programs later this year, providing research opportunities for students and faculty..
“There is no one on this planet better suited to that role than [Verveer],” Lancaster said. “We hope that this institute will become a hub for knowledge and innovation, a place to hear the voices and experiences of women in peacemaking and to conduct and sponsor evidence-based policy relevant research … focusing on the most pressing and relevant questions.”
DeGioia said that the institute will further the university’s dedication to global social justice.
“We are here to launch a new institute, a new manifestation of our effort to be ever truer to our university’s mission,” DeGioia said. “We seek new ways to advance peace and prosperity in our world.”
In her speech, Verveer said that she was happy to give back to her alma mater.
“It’s wonderful for me return back here to Georgetown in this new role after having left but a few decades ago with a couple of degrees in hand to now come back in hopes that I can pay back in some way,” Verveer said.
Verveer then introduced the members of the panel discussion, Guatemala’s first female Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz, Burmese political activist Zin Mar Aung and Equality for Peace and Democracy in Afghanistan Executive Director Nargis Nehan.
“It is women like these who are an important part of the news stories that we read about and hear about every day, but we often don’t read about and hear about the fact that they are an important part of the solution to many of the challenges their countries confront,” Verveer said.
Audience members said the ceremony was an inspirational and educational experience. “It’s always really inspiring to see women leaders speaking up on these issues,” Claire Charamnac (SFS ’11) said. “I walked away from the panel really inspired and armed with more knowledge about what women are dealing with around the world.”
