After a contentious campaign cycle, the Georgetown University Student Association inaugurated its latest class of senators at a virtual meeting last weekend.
The 15th GUSA Senate has broken records for female and Black representation, with many GUSA members hoping the accomplishment will lead to more inclusion and lasting diversity within the student government. The new senate’s first meeting on Sept. 27 may have confirmed that hope: Members from the Progressive Coalition, a group founded last semester that aims to support BIPOC and other marginalized communities on campus, won elections for all of the senate’s major leadership positions.
GUSA Senator and Progessive Coalition co-founder Leo Teixeira (COL ’21) won senate speaker, the highest leadership position in the senate. Teixeira hopes the new senate will better represent the student body and support activists and student organizations on campus. Past senate groups underrepresented women and students of color. 
“I’m tremendously grateful to have the opportunity to lead the most progressive and diverse Senate we’ve ever had,” Teixeira wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Going forward, I believe the Senate is going to enter into an era of collaboration with all of the activists and organizers on this campus whose work we will amplify, and with the marginalized communities on this campus who we will uplift and fight for.”
Both Teixeira and former Senate Speaker Daniella Sanchez (COL ’22) were nominated for the speaker position; however, Sanchez declined the nomination. Sanchez said she did not enjoy her tenure as speaker, citing pressure she faced to please many different groups while she held the position. 
“The way the senate is structured, and the way GUSA was structured, I just realized that I hated being the speaker,” Sanchez said during the meeting. “I felt that my hands were tied behind my back. I did that to myself. I’m not going to blame anyone for that, that was me, and I tried to please everyone, and in this position you cannot please everyone. And I was the person who took the fall for everything that the senate did, everything that the senate didn’t do.”
The most competitive election of the night, the Finance and Appropriations Committee vice chair election, saw incumbent GUSA Senator Olivia Kleier (SFS ’22) running against incoming freshmen Senators Bella Fassett (SFS ’24) and Lara Sophia Santana (SFS ’24). FinApp is responsible for allocating funds to student activities. Fassett was ultimately elected to the position, promising to improve FinApp’s accessibility to the student body and to better collaborate with clubs as FinApp vice chair.
“I think it’s important to recognize that FinApp as a space has been historically very exclusive and kind of inaccessible,” Fassett said during the meeting. “I think previous people involved in FinApp have used the rules and the complicated processes surrounding it as kind of a barrier to receiving funding, and I would like to make FinApp accessible in the sense that we would work with and for clubs and not against them.”
Though the meeting was a symbolic fresh start for many, several senior senators reflected on the senate’s faults and urged new representatives to address the institution’s past failures surrounding diversity and accessibility to the student body. 
As a woman of color, Sanchez felt she faced more pressure to be the perfect leader and was treated more harshly if she failed to live up to that standard.
“And for my experience, you know women of color just in general are held to a higher standard,” Sanchez said. “I think that we’re just treated so harshly by society that people think we have thicker skin, more endurance, greater strength, and I’ve tried my best to keep it all together. But in reality, I’m just learning and growing right beside you all.”
Sanchez also urged the incoming senate to hold the university administration accountable for their recent policy blunders, rather than blaming senate leadership and individuals.
“Redirect this energy to the administration, who’s not doing what they’re supposed to and not properly reacting to us because we fought hard, and they didn’t care,” Sanchez said.
Teixeira, Sanchez’s successor, pressed the new senate to support student groups and activists.
“I’ve been in the body, at this point, for close to 17 months, I think since April of 2019, and in that time, frankly, I have seen the senate fail in a lot of ways,” Teixeira said. “And I think the ways in which the senate has tended to co-opt or offer their own half-hearted advocacy or activism in lieu of empowering other student groups already committed to doing this organizing here on campus has been a great failure on our part.”
Teixeira believes the new senate leadership will be able to better fight for the student body, particularly for marginalized communities on campus.
“I think this is a huge victory for the Senate, for the Student Body, and especially for all of the marginalized communities and individuals who placed their faith in the possibility of a radically transformed, progressive Senate,” Teixeira wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The election results speak for themselves, students overwhelmingly voted for more progressive, and more diverse candidates to represent them.”
Elections for other senate leadership positions produced the following winners: Senator Melanie Cruz-Morales (COL ’22) as the vice speaker, Senator Leo Rassieur (COL ’23) as the Policy & Advocacy Committee chair and Senator Makayla Jeffries (COL ’23) as the vice chair, Senator Winston Ardoin (SFS ’21) as the FinApp chair and Senator Nicole Sanchez (SFS ’22) as the Ethics and Oversight Committee chair with Senator Jordan Brown (COL ’22) as the vice chair. Senators also approved the rules for the 15th GUSA Senate.

Unable to form friendships through late-night excursions to Epicurean and other popular on-campus activities, Georgetown University freshmen have put together small meetups with nearby classmates this semester to connect with one another.
The university’s original fall reopening plan, released in July, invited approximately 2,000 students back to campus, including the entire Class of 2024. When the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic did not improve, however, the university revised its original plan and opted instead to invite only about 500 students who secured housing because of extenuating circumstances.
Since learning they would be fully remote this fall, first-year students have sought opportunities to socialize offline, including Gershon Stein (COL ’24), the organizer of a gathering in Chicago’s Ping Tom Memorial Park. 
“When we went all online, I decided that I needed to do something to meet classmates and connect with the institution,” Stein said in an interview with The Hoya. “I’m a people person, so it was definitely very difficult to not have any foresight as to when I would meet people in person. I thought that it would be nice to meet some people who I was going to school with.”
Inevitably, the meetup was a little awkward at first, but authentically meeting classmates in person cannot be replicated online, according to Stein.
“I think that everyone’s a little starved for social interaction,” Stein said. “A breakout room is never going to have the same effect as you coupling off with people and talking in a class or at a large event. Part of it is breakout rooms are random, and you also don’t get the same facial expression or idea of how people take up space.”
Maximilian Goetz (MSB ’24), who organized a San Francisco Bay Area meetup, agreed Zoom can limit flexibility in conversation. 
“When you’re in a group on Zoom and one person talks, everyone hears, but when you are in a group in person, you can have side conversations and really get to know people,” Goetz said in an interview with The Hoya.
The meetups not only provide students an opportunity to connect with one another, but also offer a chance to connect with the Georgetown community and culture at large, according to Jolie Ouyang (SFS ’24) who attended a Bay Area meetup. 
“I know I have Georgetown merch, but considering how we’re not actually on campus, it’s really hard to consider myself part of the community,” Ouyang said in an interview with The Hoya.
Regional meetups make a big difference to approximate a normal college social life, according to Maeve Foley (COL ’24), who attended a meet up in New York City. 
“The meetup was helpful for knowing that there are people really nearby you that you can hang out with and socialize with, and it kind of made it easier not being on campus because you know that you still do have people in your local area,” Foley said in an interview with The Hoya.
Although first-year students are still excited to get back to campus and meet more people in person, for now, the meetups are the best way to stay connected, according to Ouyang. 
“I think meeting up in person has been one of the most effective ways because I have been in a lot of GroupMes and Zoom calls, and many of them were for social reasons, and I don’t think any of it beats actually meeting people,” Ouyang said. “You get a different sense of who everyone is when you actually see them compared to doing it through Zoom because there is a level of anonymity.”

U.S. Marshals arrested Georgetown University football player Dijon Williams in his home state of Georgia on Monday evening for his suspected role in a murder in Washington, D.C., this summer. 
The senior wide receiver is under suspicion of shooting and killing Nurudeen Thomas, 30, in the Petworth neighborhood of D.C. in late July. Georgetown’s football team suspended Williams upon hearing of the arrest, but he has not been subject to further disciplinary action. 
“Georgetown University became aware of charges against Dijon Williams this evening,” the university wrote in a statement to the Fox 5 news channel. “While we are working to learn more information, we will cooperate fully with any investigation and we stand prepared to offer resources to members of our community who may be affected by this news.”
Williams joined the football team in 2017, playing 10 games his freshman year and making one start. The Atlanta native sat out his sophomore year due to injury and played five games during his junior year. In 15 career games, Williams recorded three receptions for 17 yards. The Patriot League suspended all fall sporting events in July because of the COVID-19 pandemic, cancelling the football team’s season. 
Williams is being detained in Georgia pending extradition to D.C., according to the Washington Post.
This is a developing story.
