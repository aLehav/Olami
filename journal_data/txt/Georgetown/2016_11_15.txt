More than 2,000 people, including Georgetown students, gathered for a vigil and peaceful demonstration against the rhetoric of President-elect Donald Trump at the White House on Saturday.
The hourlong event, which was organized by Georgetown University Law Center student Julie Rheinstrom (GRD ’17), featured the distribution of over 1,000 electric candles and glow sticks, singing, a moment of silence and poetry readings to show solidarity for communities that may be affected byTrump’s policies and rhetoric. Although the event was not affiliated with any political organization, participants were encouraged to express support for Black Lives Matter and the LGBTQ community by wearing clothing representing the causes and communities.
With help from 10 friends living in Washington, D.C., Rheinstrom mobilized demonstrators through a Facebook event created three days prior to the scheduled event, which ended up being shared with over 14,000 people. Rheinstrom attained a permit for the vigil in Lafayette Square from the National Parks Service on Nov. 10.
Rheinstrom said she created the event after feeling crestfallen at Trump’s election and his remarks calling for a ban on Muslim immigration to the United States, as well as characterizing Mexican immigrants without documentation as criminals and rapists.
“There’s a big ‘us versus them’ dichotomy that is very dangerous for our country that I wanted to stand up against,” Rheinstrom wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our theme for the event was a quote popularized by Eleanor Roosevelt: ‘It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.’”
The event included original poetry recitations from American University juniors Molly McGinnis and Emma Claire-Martin. Martin said her poem “Nothing Rhymes with Orange” encapsulated the fear, anger and heartbreak many Americans felt after the election.
“When there’s nothing poetic about people fearing for their lives, our poetry will not be gentle,” Martin said during her performance.
A video of Martin’s poem, along with photographs from the event, were documented on social media under the hashtag #solidarityDC.
Rheinstrom said she hopes students continue to use social media to speak out against hateful rhetoric from the 2016 presidential election.
“As Georgetown students, we are all incredibly well-positioned to serve as advocates,” Rheinstrom wrote. “It has never been more important to help each other out, and to show each other and the world that the rhetoric from this campaign — the racism and the xenophobia — do not define who we are.”
The vigil was one of several demonstrations held in the District since Trump’s election. The White House previously was the site of protests in the early hours of Nov. 9, even before the election results were announced. Protesters have also gathered in front of the newly opened Trump International Hotel, Washington, D.C., every night since Nov. 10, causing an increase in security around the hotel. Wednesday night, the U.S. Park Police arrested one person at the White House protest.
Similar demonstrations have been held in other large cities including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, along with smaller cities such as Iowa City, Iowa, and Richmond, Va.
Brenna McSweeney (COL ’20), who attended the event, said it was cathartic after an emotional week.
“I have had a really rough past few days emotionally, and I wanted to be in a community where no one would judge me if I cried or got upset,” McSweeney said. “I think there are a lot of people in this community and in the world who are genuinely afraid right now and it’s important to show support for those people.”
Susu Zhao (COL ’19), who also attended, said the event was a refreshing reminder of unity after an election fraught with divisive rhetoric.
“I thought it was really nice that people were coming together in a show of solidarity, not just to protest the recent election results but also to show that there are people who care about the groups of people who will be deeply impacted by Donald Trump as president,” Zhao said.
Zhao added that she considered the event necessary given the division and anger she has seen in the country since the election.
“There was just a lot of love at the event and I think that’s what we really need right now, to support each other and kind of gather strength to make our voices heard,” Zhao said.

A petition urging the university to hire a full-time coordinator for students without documentation  has amassed 721 signatures from members of the Georgetown community as of press time.
Student advocacy group UndocuHoyas launched the petition Nov. 1 in coordination with Hoyas for Immigrant Rights, which represents immigrant students at Georgetown. It aims to bridge a gap between the administration’s Undocumneted Students Task Force and students without documentation at Georgetown.
The university established the Undocumented Students Task Force in the summer of 2015 to address issues related to students without documentation. The task force is composed of faculty, financial aid staff, deans and members of the religious community.
The work of the task force culminated in the institutionalization of resources in a support website that was launched April 7.
“Though we appreciate the support we have received from the university so far, we find it imperative to hire a coordinator to help direct students to the correct resources and to help UndocuHoyas find their home on the Hilltop,” the petition reads.
The online petition, which will be delivered to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, will remain open for signatures until December, when the Office of Student Affairs is due to discuss the budget for the 2017-18 fiscal year, in time to hire the coordinator for the next academic year.
The university has not had a liaison between undocumented students and the administration since December 2015, when part-time liason Cinthya Salazar left to pursue a doctorate degree at the University of Maryland.
Olson said he and Associate Dean of Students Dennis Williams have been working to identify a candidate to liaise between the university and students without documentation.
“Dean Dennis Williams and I have been meeting with students on this, the concerns raised are being carefully considered, and we are actively working to identify a point person to coordinate our support for undocumented students,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We care about these experiences and the needs of these students, and we are committed to supporting them.”
Clara Mejía Orta (COL ’18), a student without documentation and a member of UndocuHoyas, said students without documentation need a liaison with the university.
“This position is essential to guarantee not only the well-being but also the overall success of undocumented students on campus. We need someone to be there that we can go to express our concerns and express our feelings and would actively advocate and fight for us at the institutional level,” Mejía Orta said.
Students without documentation originally met with Olson on Oct. 20 to address the need for a coordinator in a meeting facilitated by the Georgetown University Student Association.
GUSA has also worked to connect students without documentation and the university. This semester, GUSA created an Undocumented Student Inclusivity policy team, which advocates for the university to recognize students without documentation as it does other students.
“We heard loud and clear that this is something they needed, and immediately we jumped on convening those students to talk to key administrators about those issues,” GUSA Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) said. “At that meeting, administrators were very receptive to the need, so our role moving forward is pushing the end as much as we can and holding administrators accountable.”
The policy team has been focused on reconvening the task force following a summer hiatus, pushing for the undocumented student coordinator position and creating connections within the community.
Josué Coronado (COL ’18), who lives in Casa Latina, a living learning community for Latinx students, said education on issues surrounding Georgetown students without documentation must be brought to the forefront.
“These conversations are going on in House and Senate buildings a mile and a half away from here, but these conversations aren’t even happening here at Georgetown.” Coronado said. “There needs to be more education about this, and that education starts with a conversation, and that conversation starts with awareness. That’s why spaces are so important.”
Mejía Orta said students without documentation have missed having Salazar as a liaison with the university.
“She was really the force of support I found here at Georgetown, and after her transition out of the school, there definitely was this disconnection between the undocumented community as a whole,” Mejía Orta said.
A coordinator for undocumented students is crucial in raising greater awareness for issues affecting students without documentation especially given the current political climate, according to Casa Latina resident Citlalli Velasquez (COL ’17).
“What’s scary is that we don’t know what’s going to happen,” Velasquez said. “It’s the moment where we need to support each other, but undocumented people are on the frontline. If you’re not a citizen, you’re not considered a human.”
Mizraim Belman Guerrero (SFS ’20), a student without documentation, said there is hope to be found in the communal aspect of the conversation surrounding immigration.
“I think we’re all proud of being such a close-knit community here at Georgetown, and I think we should always take care of one another. I think every student should have that opportunity to thrive, and this is a community that faces unique challenges,” Belman Guerrero said.

Yes, let’s get the university to continue to hire more administrative staff to support small, vocal groups. Let’s continue to pass on bloated administrative costs into tuition. $60K per year? Heck, let’s set our targets on a $100K per year. Maybe the university will finally wake up and realize that it needs to rethink how to educate its students and will stop focusing on this asinine demands from obnoxious, whiny students. Students emerging from the cushy world of academia are in for a rude awakening when they realize the real world does not cater to every need. Grow up.
Georgetown is SO poorly run and continues to waste precious resources on ridiculous requests like this. For shame.

https://www.thehoya.com/tuition-sees-4-percent-hike-for-2016-2017/
And students wonder why tuition continues to rise.  Hiring more administrators will continue to put more tuition burden on students and families who already must sacrifice much to attend school here.  I hope many of my fellow Hoyas think about that before they sign petitions for more administrators.

Do I understand correctly that the point of the editorial is that more time, money and resources from a limited pool should be dedicated to students who aren’t legally  in the country?  
Did Georgetown just lower its price?  Count me in.

A group of students launched a petition yesterday addresed to Special Presidential Envoy to Hostage Affairs James O’Brien to expedite the release of Austin Tice (SFS ’02), a journalist who was kidnapped while on assignment in Syria on Aug. 14, 2012.
Georgetown University Student Association Chief of Staff Ari Goldstein (SFS ’18), who was involved in creating the online petition, said it aims to receive 5,000 signatures from members of the Georgetown community by Jan. 20, President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration day. The petition is in the form of a letter addressed to O’Brien.
The GUSA senate passed a resolution Sunday in support of the petition prior to its launch, urging the university to raise awareness for Austin Tice’s situation.
“We decided to do this as a letter that people could sign on to rather than as traditional petition because we thought it would have more of a narrative effect and because Austin’s story is so much bigger than any of us,” Goldstein said.
Emily Kaye (COL ’18), Samantha Rhodes (COL ’17), Naaz Modan (COL ’18) (Full disclosure: Modan is a member of The Hoya’s editorial board), Henry Callander (COL ’18) and other students started the petition with the support of journalism program Director Barbara Feinman Todd and Georgetown Director of Federal Relations Scott Fleming.
According to Feinman Todd, the GUSA resolution, which calls for the university to take action, including hanging a banner on campus with Austin Tice’s name and creating a university-sponsored web page for the cause, could help attract further attention to Austin’s cause beyond the Georgetown community.
Feinman Todd took a group of students to the Newseum two weeks ago, when it unveiled a large banner of Austin Tice outside its Pennsylvania Avenue entrance, pledging to keep it up until he returns.
“There’s always more we can do. A specific thing I’m hoping Georgetown will do is hang a banner similar to the one at the Newseum in a prominent place,” Feinman Todd said. “It would be the next thing and it could be a big public thing.”
Goldstein said GUSA’s support of the petition indicates solidarity for the cause.
“The resolution in GUSA was GUSA coming together saying we as a body sign on to this letter. For the 29 senators to speak with one voice and say we need to stand together with Austin Tice and urge President Obama to do more to secure his release is a powerful statement,” Goldstein said.
The Georgetown University Law Center Student Bar Association House of Delegates passed a resolution in support of Austin Tice on March 15, 2016. His mother, Debra Tice, said she was touched by the continuing efforts of Georgetown and its students in support of her son.
“We are humbled and deeply amazed,” Debra Tice said in an interview with The Hoya. “We have a new appreciation for the rallying cry ‘Hoya Saxa.’”
Both Debra Tice and her husband Marc Tice have signed the petition. Marc Tice said the support from the Georgetown community is immensely powerful in pushing for Austin Tice’s release.
“Georgetown University, its alumni and its students are so highly respected. So many Georgetown alumni are on Capitol Hill and go on to positions of real prominence so it’s incredible for us to have that kind of support from that institution and the people representing it,” Marc Tice said.
Debra Tice and Marc Tice participated in a panel discussion at Georgetown on April 6 as part of the Salim El-Lozi Lecture Series, organized by Feinman Todd and sponsored by the undergraduate journalism program.
Discussion at Georgetown inspired media attention, as well as a rally at the White House on April 18.
Feinman Todd said these efforts are important to ensure sure the government is continually reminded of Austin Tice’s situation.
“We’re just trying to keep his name in the news so people don’t forget him,” Feinman Todd said. “Whomever else is making decisions about where our government puts our resources toward, I am hoping that they will understand that the Georgetown community has not forgotten Austin, that he is one of our own and that we care and that we want them to do whatever they can within their power to find a way to bring him home.”
Debra Tice said the campaigns have served as encouragement for her and the larger community to keep fighting for acknowledgment from government officials such as Secretary of State John Kerry.
“They have all been such positive campaigns of encouragement. There hasn’t been anything critical or shaming, it’s just looking to secure Austin’s release and encouraging President Obama to keep up the good work, encouraging Secretary Kerry to push on,” Debra Tice said. “Now this new letter that’s going out says that we recognize that you are committed to this and we encourage you not to grow weary of doing good.”
According to Feinman Todd, Austin Tice’s case is important not only on a personal level, but in terms of its larger significance of protecting the freedom of the press.
“In addition to wanting the spotlight to be on Austin, we feel it’s imperative that freedom of the press is a value that is honored by our government, now more than ever,” Feinman Todd said. “In light of the election last week we feel it’s important that we keep this situation front and center. It’s about Austin, about a Hoya, but it’s also about global freedom of the press. We feel that freedom of the press is being held hostage.”
Marc Tice said supporting Austin Tice is supporting every individual’s right to free speech.
“While we are of course laser focused on getting our son home safely, there is a much larger issue here which is our freedom of the press.” Marc Tice said. “Everything Georgetown is doing, while it may have Austin’s name on it, we feel is also a support of the right to press freedom.”
Feinman Todd said the petition is a small action that will have a large impact.
“It takes 20 seconds,” Feinman Todd said. “This is something that will get the attention of people who can do something. It is going to achieve more than liking a post on Facebook.”

Can we get a link, or guidance as to how alumni and others can sign this petition online?  Also, a link to the background story and details surrounding Mr. Tice’s abduction and developments since then would be helpful to those of us unaware of the story until reading today’s article, for which I’m very grateful.   Thank you.

Thanks for asking, Gary and Suzanne. Our web page is journalism.georgetown.edu/freeaustintice –– we’d love your signatures and your help spreading the word amongst fellow Hoyas. 
If you’re interested in learning more about Austin’s story, one of my favorite articles is this comprehensive piece from Texas Monthly: https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-road-to-damascus/. There was also a nice story in the Washington Post a few weeks ago: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/austin-tices-mother-asks-her-sons-captors-to-let-her-know-what-they-expect/2016/11/01/c5460a68-a067-11e6-8832-23a007c77bb4_story.html
Let’s bring Austin home!

The Georgetown Scholarship Program launches its third annual #GSProud campaign today with events lined up for the week to celebrate students from low-income and first-generation backgrounds at Georgetown.
#GSProud began two years ago in celebration of GSP’s 10th anniversary as a campaign to acknowledge Georgetown’s socioeconomic diversity and has evolved into a celebration of GSP students’ accomplishments.
GSP provides financial support for over 625 undergraduates — many of whom are first-generation students — through access to resources and support networks, such as peer advisors and free Counseling and Psychiatric Services.
The week’s programming includes a discussion of economic inclusivity on campus on Wednesday titled “Designing a More Class-Inclusive Georgetown.” Featuring a panel discussion and breakout sessions, the event will invite students to share their stories of inclusivity and challenges while discussing ways to improve inclusion at Georgetown.
GSP members and organizers will distribute information and memorabilia from the program at the kickoff in Red Square, and lead a social media initiative beginning Thursday on Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.
GSP Student Board President Jason Low (COL ’17) said the campaign’s goal is to change the perceptions of low-income and first-generation college students to showcase their achievements.
“[GSP students] are often categorized in a narrow framework as students of color, ‘poor,’ and come from low-performing high schools without strong networks or knowledge about college life,” Low wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In the moment, we forget that low-income and first-generation college students enrich our community so much more than what the university provides for them.”
GSP Student Board Outreach and Strategic Partnership Co-Chair Bserat Ghebremicael (MSB’17) said the social media aspect of the campaign has increased the visibility of GSP as an organization and its students.
“Since the hashtag was created a couple years ago, I’ve truly seen how #GSProud has really brought the Georgetown community together,” Ghebremicael wrote in an email to The Hoya. “More people are aware of the Georgetown Scholarship Program and we’re really starting to increase the dialogue around low income and/or first generation students.”
Ghebremicael said the increased awareness of socioeconomic issues has led to a tangible response from the university community.
“You see that with the new Advisory Board for Affordability and Access, and with student organizations being cognizant of the students they hire and/or accept,” Ghebremicael wrote. “We still have some work to do, however, and that’s why #GSProud has turned into an annual celebration of students — for more awareness, more dialogue, and more structural change at Georgetown.”
Low said #GSProud works to bring the GSP community and other students together.
“Most of all, #GSProud reminds us that there is an everlasting opportunity to grow and to engage in ongoing dialogue with one another — ultimately with the intention of producing a more supportive and inclusive Hilltop for low-income and first-generation college students,” Low wrote.
Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said #GSProud is a unique opportunity to highlight student accomplishments.
“#GSProud is always a great time of the year because it’s about empowering those students in GSP because a lot of them are leaders on campus and active change-makers here.” Khan said. “It’s about really putting spotlight on what is an amazing program that has supported an amazing group of students.”
Low said the campaign is meant to remind students that they belong at Georgetown.
“#GSProud is a moment to celebrate the incredible accomplishments and successes of our students. This celebration reaffirms the notion that low-income and first-generation students belong on the Hilltop and demonstrates that Georgetown has cultivated a community where we welcome, include and recognize these students,” Low wrote.
Office of the President Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara said the organization is central to student life at Georgetown.
“We are deeply proud of the achievements of our students in GSP, and we remain grateful to GSP for its role in contributing to an ever more inclusive, caring and supportive campus community,” Ferrara wrote in an email to The Hoya.

The university is investigating potential cyber harassment incidents by a Facebook account under the name John Carroll, after a student and the Georgetown University Student Association reported the account for multiple incidents of harassment following President-elect Donald Trump’s Nov. 8 victory.
The account sent private messages to multiple students, including Jawad Pullin (COL ’18), who received a series of messages Nov. 9 and Nov. 13 during a Facebook conversation between Pullin and the account, including messages encouraging him to take his own life.
“I’ve received follow-up messages from the account that have descended from the original comment to threats of retaliation, then blackmail, then victim blaming, then trying to clarify that is was a joke, and most recently offering a truce,” Pullin wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Pullin initially reported these incidents to the Georgetown University Police Department Nov. 9.
The account’s namesake is the university’s first president, Fr. John Carroll, S.J., who founded Georgetown in 1789. The account has made inflammatory comments on students’ posts.
GUPD is aware of the reports and is currently investigating them, according to GUPD Deputy Chief Joseph Smith.
The Georgetown University Student Association has reported the incidents to GUPD and the Division of Student Affairs, according to GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17).
Khan said there is no place for the account, or the type of speech it expresses, at Georgetown.
“The next step is further investigating the account. Ideally, an account bullying students shouldn’t be on Facebook or using university Wi-Fi,” Khan said.
Khan said it is important students feel comfortable reporting harassment to the university.
“My feeling is there is a number of other students who have received unwanted messages from this John Carroll account,” Khan said. “How do we create a culture where students feel comfortable speaking up to the university? Is there a mistrust of the university? Because that may be a barrier to reporting and something we need to continue to address.”
Pullin said the account poses a threat to all members of the Georgetown community.
“I’ve dealt with much worse in my life, and a keyboard coward with Twitter fingers is not going to make me lose sleep,” Pullin wrote. “However, if he could say that to me he could say it to anyone, and honestly that’s the kind of unchecked behavior that needs to be ended immediately.”
Khan also said GUSA will address these incidents and the larger topic of appropriate speech at a Free Speech Open Forum on Thursday sponsored by GUSA’s Free Speech Policy Team and the university’s Speech and Expression Committee, which oversees implementation and interpretation of the Speech and Expression Policy.
“Where do we draw the line? This is not just a John Carroll conversation, especially with the election,” Khan said. “How do we draw the line between expressing political opinion versus harassment and bullying? Students being aware they should report these things is a big part of that.”

Correction: This article previously stated Jawad Pullin (COL ’18) is in the School of Foreign Service; he is in the College.

The John Carroll account is the social media face of the Georgetown Academy? LOL, it’s like saying http://www.kkkknights.com is the social media face of America (well, may be for some and you know who you are). This John Carroll account doesn’t even a real name associated with it. Puh pleez.

Don’t lie blatantly unless you know to whom you are lying.
I have screenshots of the John Carroll account recruiting me for the Academy.
I also have a screenshot of the John Carroll complimenting Mr. Paz on an article he wrote for the Academy. I’m not deeply familiar with editorial ethics, but that would seem to me to have been a conflict of interest with writing this article.

Georgetown University Law Center announced the Nov. 4 launch of the Institute for Technology Law and Policy, a new initiative geared toward examining emerging issues in technology ranging from cybersecurity to intellectual property.
The institute aims to convene conferences and workshops on technology issues as well as assemble a team of technology law and policy scholars seeking an immersive experience in the field. Later this fall, the institute will also launch the Georgetown Technology Review, a new student-led journal that aims to provide legal analysis and news in the world of technology policy.
Executive Director of the Institute for Technology Policy Alexandra Reeve Givens most recently served as chief counsel for IP and antitrust on the Senate Committee on the Judiciary while working for Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) (GRD ’64).
GULC Dean William Treanor said the institute was created to consolidate the existing programs that delve into technology policy.
“In each way technology is transforming the practice of law and the law school has a number of faculty members and a number of centers that are focused on part of that issue,” Treanor said. “But we wanted to create an umbrella organization that would bring everyone together and look at issues in the broadest context.”
Treanor added that the legal field had evolved greatly as a result of technological advances over the past few decades.
“A few years ago, cybersecurity or data privacy were not issues of great significance. Now they are issues of fundamental importance,” Treanor said. “When I graduated from law school and even 10 years ago, new litigators would spend most of their time reviewing documents by hand. A computer algorithm can now do in nanoseconds what it took thousands of hours of lawyers to do in the past.”
Reeve Givens said the institute will equip a new generation of lawyers with the tools necessary to remain competitive in the changing legal field.
“Going forward, every company is going to be a technology company and every lawyer and adviser needs to be equipped with the skills to provide advice in a new digital economy,” Reeve Givens said. “We are really trying to integrate the training of our students to make sure they feel prepared to serve the 21st century market place.”
Reeve Givens said the institute’s launch has been met with enthusiasm from the student body, particularly with the creation of the Georgetown Technology Review.
“The response has been great so far,” Reeve Givens said. “The editors of that opened up the application process for student participation and they had 85 applicants within the first two hours.”
Reeve Givens said what separates Georgetown’s offerings in technology from other institutions is their location and ability to utilize D.C.’s resources.
“For us, from the law school, Congress is five blocks away,” Reeve Givens said. “What we want is our students understanding the technology but then spending significant time with the policy makers who affect the technology industries to get exposure to ideas and the type of debate that happens in D.C.”
Stephanie Goldberg (GRD ’19) echoed this sentiment, affirming her belief that the institute’s location in the District will allow for the inclusion of leading figures in technology policy.
“I’m a student interested in this area, so personally I am excited to see this sort of development occur, especially because I think we will be able to bring in really top-level officials just being in D.C.,” Goldberg said. “This is really the nexus for policy, so we can really access officials at different agencies and it really allows us to assert our position in being a top law school.”
Kelly Singleton (GRD ’17), who currently serves as a research assistant at the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology, which will be part of the new institute, said the program will strengthen GULC’s existing technology-based classes.
“We are the perfect place for lawyers, policy makers and technologists to come together and contribute to advancing privacy and civil liberties concerns associated with new technology,” Singleton said. “It’s going to concentrate all our efforts into one space so that students are able to take advantage of the resources we already have at Georgetown.”

The main gates and Copley Lawn were cordoned off with caution tape for about 8 hours yesterday after Washington Gas Light contractors struck a natural gas line while performing excavations in front of the main gate, causing a gas leak.
The university issued a HoyaAlert at 1:43 p.m. urging the community to avoid the intersection of 37th and O Street. The D.C. Fire and EMS Department, Georgetown University Police Department and Washington Gas responded to the incident.
A second HoyaAlert was sent at 9:39 p.m. announcing the gas leak had been repaired.
Workers at the intersection could be seen breaking the pavement and digging a hole in ground, while a strong odor of natural gas was noted by students in the area near Healy and Copley lawns.
Washington Gas Light provides natural gas for customers in the D.C. metro area. The company was unavailable for comment as of press time.
According to Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh, the situation was quickly addressed by emergency crews and the university.
“Washington Gas’ contractor struck the line and reported it immediately to the emergency crews onsite so the response was rapid and quickly plugged the leak,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
A GUPD officer on scene said the gas leak posed no imminent danger to students on campus and advised everyone to avoid the area while repairs were in progress.
The Hoya could not reach GUPD for an official statement as of press time.
Despite the proximity of the leak to Alumni Square, Pugh said no students were forced to evacuate and no university operations were impacted.
Residents of the Alumni Square Townhouses reported normal functioning of their gas stoves and heating systems.
“Students were only affected by detours around the repair. Services were not affected,” Pugh wrote.
Students were advised against using entrances close to the main gates, according to Alumni Square Community Director Eileen Rodriguez in an email to all residents of Alumni Square.
Prithish David (MSB ’17) said he first noticed the warning signs on 36th Street, and immediately began to smell the gas as soon as he approached the fenced-off front gates.
“When I walked up here I could smell the weird gas smell,” David said. “It is literally all blocked off and you can’t go anywhere.”

Women in business have the potential to break down societal gender divides, according to speakers at the Georgetown’s Gender and Development Forum in the Intercultural Center Auditorium on Friday.
The event, co-hosted by Georgetown Anti-Poverty Society and Georgetown Women in International Affairs, featured “A Series of Short, Powerful Talks,” aimed to engage students in understanding the role of gender in careers.
Melanne Verveer, the executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and former U.S. ambassador for Global Women’s Issues, said women have the power to promote change.
“Women are on the frontlines of change, all over the world,” Verveer said.
Sudhir Shetty, the chief economist for the East Asia and Pacific region of the World Bank, said it is important to target the determinants of gender inequality rather than the symptoms.
“A lot of differences between men and women are not caused by discrimination, but by the fact that they work in different sections of the labor force,” Shetty said. “Carpenters earn a lot more than caterers. So the question becomes, how can we get women into those sectors of the economy that pay more?”
Evelyn Suarez, the president of the Association of Women in International Trade, said women participating in trade have the potential to help women across the world.
“It offers opportunities for women on both ends of the development spectrum,” Suarez said. “But unfortunately, trade is in trouble.”
Suarez said the Trump administration may enact far-reaching consequences on global trade.
“This is a very painful time for people in international trade,” Suarez said. “Unfortunately, we have had a movement against globalization, against trade, which is reflected in things like Brexit and the rhetoric of the 2016 presidential election.”
Emily Bove, the executive director of the advocacy group Women Thrive Alliance, said a grassroots movement working directly with women’s rights organizations is necessary.
“If you take all the money that is being invested in gender and development, only 0.5 percent is reaching women’s rights organizations,” Bove said.
Bove said enhanced collaboration between the women’s rights movement and the international development community is necessary to ensure the continuity of the women’s rights movement in light of President-elect Donald Trump’s victory over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
“It is important to do so today more than ever to ensure that the global women’s rights movement survives the next four years,” Bove said.
Elizabeth Vazquez, the president, CEO and co-founder of WEConnect International, a nonprofit that connects female suppliers and women-owned businesses to global markets, expressed the importance of funding women’s business opportunities.
“If we can get more money into the hands of women, they will ensure that this will be a better world for everyone,” Vazquez said.
Vazquez said female entrepreneurs face numerous challenges in securing startup funding.
“It is really hard in an asset-based lending environment to secure funding if you don’t have assets in the first place, if you don’t have equal access to economic opportunity,” Vazquez said.
The forum provided a platform for discussion on how to build a more inclusive global economy for everyone, according to Vazquez.
“It was really exciting to hear what is happening in the space of women’s development and seeing this not only as a discussion about human rights, but at the same time about having economic empowerment and resources,” Vasquez said.
GAPS Board Member Spencer Parsons (GRD ’17), who attended the forum, praised the scope and depth of topics covered by the speakers.
“This was a great opportunity to have a lot of different practitioners come together and talk about gender in a cross-sectional way, that was very impactful,” Parsons said.
Meghan Bodette (SFS ’20), who also attended the forum, said the forum successfully promoted the theme of female empowerment and ability.
“Women aren’t necessarily the victims of their own circumstance,” Bodette said. “They are actors with agency.”

Inflammation can slow the early development of cancers in a protein-producing gene, said Georgetown University Medical Center researchers and alumni who took part in a five-year study published Nov. 3.
The report also advised cancer patients to exercise caution when using anti-inflammatory antioxidants.
The slowing down of cancers linked to the mutation of the Neurofibromin 2 gene can be triggered by inflammation, according to the research team led by researcher Chunling Yi, an assistant professor at the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center’s molecular oncology program. However, inflammation can also speed up the growth of cancerous cells after a certain point, placing patients taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs at risk.
In an interview with THE HOYA, Yi explained the positive effects DNA damage can have on cancerous cells and why inflammation can be beneficial.
“When you have a tumor that is already formed, DNA damage can actually be a good thing for the tumor cells because it makes the tumor cells grow slower,” Yi said. “So, if you try to reduce DNA damage and inflammation in a tumor cell, it can actually have a counterproductive result.”
Yi added that one of the pathways linked to the NF2 gene’s formation of merlin, which involves a protein known as Rac1, actually suppresses cancerous cells early in their development.
“You think about Rac1 like a brake on the tumor cells,” Yi said. “The sense is that there’s too much happening so they actually put a brake on it. When you take this brake away, the cells will grow out of control.”
Yi noted that the study’s original purpose was to see which pathway involved with NF2 was most important for cancer proliferation: either the one involving Rac1 or another involving the protein Yap.
According to Yi, the discovery of Rac1’s role as a cancer suppressor actually surprised the researchers, who did not think it inhibited cancer.
“We realized when we did this experiment in a mouse, it was much more complicated than we thought,” Yi said. “Rac1 actually had the opposite effect than we originally hypothesized.”
Two former Georgetown undergraduate students, Yuhao Shi (NHS ’15) and Saumya Bollam (COL ’16), assisted Yi in the study, marking the first times their names have appeared in a research publication.
Shi said the study could have multiple potential effects, including helping drug developers create more targeted therapies to treat cancers involved with the NF2 pathway.
“Once we can find more druggable targets to different proteins that are essential for how the disease happened, those therapies are more specific,” Shi said. “There’s less side effects and it’s more personalized for that specific disease.”
Bollam said with the new information, some treatments of cancers involving the Rac1 protein could be made more effective.
“You have to be careful on how you see the conclusion from any study because there’s obvious limitations,” Bollam said. “What we were able to achieve, in part, was there’s some treatments that are being given to patients who have cancers that have a molecular background that might not work as well.”
Both Shi and Bollam praised working in a lab environment with Yi. Shi, who worked with Yi during his freshman year at Georgetown, encouraged other undergraduate students with an interest in the sciences to get involved with research.
“I think this was a great story for undergrads who are pursuing research now. And that is, you can do a lot, and there’s a lot to be accomplished as an undergrad in a lab,” Shi said. “That’s undervalued sometimes.”
Bollam, who worked with Yi from her sophomore to senior year, said students might find the application of concepts learned from class to be helpful to their overall understanding of scientific issues.
“I found that I did my best learning in Dr. Yi’s lab,” Bollam said. “It was miles more beneficial to me to learn by doing than learn by lectures in the classroom and there was a lot that I learned through my regular classes I was able to apply in the lab.”

The Office of Residential Living’s “A Moveable Feast” program has provided almost 200 Georgetown students and faculty members opportunities to gather for conversation in a casual setting over a meal paid for by Residential Living in the 2015-16 school year.
The program, established in 2013, was designed to encourage students to connect with their professors and deans in a more casual space, according to Associate Director of Residential Living Katie Heather.
Students may apply in groups of three or more for a $100 stipend for their meal with one faculty member, which can take place in a residence hall or at a local restaurant.
Heather said students and faculty participated in 40 events during the 2015-16 academic year. Each meal included a faculty member or a dean.
“The reaction from students has been overwhelmingly positive. Additionally, the program was well-received by representatives from Academic Affairs,” Heather said.
The name of the program comes from author Ernest Hemingway’s memoir “A Moveable Feast,” where he writes, “If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.”
Heather said she hopes students who participate in a dinner will remember their conversations after graduation.
“We hope this program will encourage reflective conversations with students and faculty that will stay with students after their final class at Georgetown,” Heather said.
Students said they have found the meals to be a good way to connect with their professors outside of the classroom.
Joyce Song (SFS ’18) organized a meal for her Chinese class last year with her teaching assistant. The class met at Kafe Leopold and enjoyed discussion outside of the classroom, according to Song.
“It was pretty cool because it eliminates the financial burden for a lot of students. It was nice to get out and talk about other things besides classwork, especially since Georgetown students tend to get really caught up with our academics,” Song said.
Brody Ladd (SFS ’19) shared a meal with his proseminar class last fall. Ladd said they spent their evening listening to stories of their professor’s time in Latin America.
Ladd said he saw the value in learning from his professor in a different context.
“It was great getting to know our professor on a more personal level, and some of his experiences he shared were as valuable as the topics we were sharing in class,” Ladd said. “I feel like a lot of professors have similarly valuable experiences and these dinners allow them to share those stories with their students.”
