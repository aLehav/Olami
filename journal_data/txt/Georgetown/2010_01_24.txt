Two crimes occurred early Saturday morning, according to two Public Safety Alerts sent to the campus community Saturday afternoon. A burglary took place in Village C West at 2:10 am, and a robbery occurred off campus at 3:40 am.
At about 2:10 a.m. Saturday, two unidentifiedmales entered the unlocked room of a student in Village C West, according to a PSA sent at about 4:30 p.m. One of the suspects touched the student’s hand, then fled the room when she screamed, heading in an unknown direction. Both suspects are described as males in their twenties. The student immediately notified the Department of Public Safety, which responded to the scene but located no suspects.
About an hour and a half later, a student was robbed by an unknown male in the 3600 block of O Street. The PSA states the student was walking home on O Street adjacent to Alumni Square at about 3:40 a.m. The suspect pushed the student against a wall and demanded money, according to a separate PSA. The student gave the suspect 50 dollars in cash, after which he fled in an unknown direction. The suspect was described as a white male wearing a hat and black jacket.
The student notified DPS at 11:40 a.m., and DPS responded to her residence to take the report. The student declined to report the incident to the Metropolitan Police Department; no mention of MPD is made in conjunction with the earlier burglary.
DPS investigations are ongoing for both crimes. No physical injuries were reported in either incident.
