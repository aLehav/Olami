More than 40 students marched into Epicurean and Co. on Monday afternoon to present a petition with 500-plus student signatures to owner Chang Wook Chon, demanding fair treatment of Epicurean workers.
The event was organized by the Georgetown Solidarity Committee with the help of members of Georgetown chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Hoyas for Immigrant Rights and the Georgetown University Student Association.
Chon was charged in 2010 with withholding overtime wages from workers and violating the Fair Labor Standards Act. He pled guilty in March to criminal contempt for violating a court order issued during a civil lawsuit.
Although Chon’s civil lawsuit is ongoing, Chon is also accused of bribing an employee who had attempted to recover back wages through the lawsuit with the promise of a promotion if he would drop the civil case.
The group presented its petition to Chon and gave cards and flowers to the restaurant’s employees.
“Georgetown is defined by its commitment to uphold its Jesuit values. Epicurean workers are valuable members of our community, and as students we’re extremely concerned about how the workers have been treated,” GSC member Irene Koo (COL ’16) said.
The event was also meant to motivate the university administration, which protestors say has not been properly responsive to worker conditions on campus. Students said the university had not enforced its Just Employment Policy, which was implemented in 2005 after a group of GSC students mounted a successful hunger strike to urge the administration to raise custodial workers’ wages in a Living Wage Campaign.
In the petition, students called on Chon to make a public commitment to the Just Employment Policy, work with the university to set up accountability measures and institute Just Employment Policy training for Epicurean workers.
Hoyas for Immigrant Rights President Citlalli Alvarez (COL ’16) said she hoped the protest raised awareness among the student body and exerted pressure on the university and Chon.
“We hope that it sent a clear message that Georgetown students are interested in what’s happening at Epicurean and that [Chon] would feel pressured to ultimately run his workplace in a way that it needs to be run and provide his workers their deserved rights,” Alvarez said.
Students who participated saw the event as a way to demonstrate their commitment for just treatment of Georgetown employees.
When asked about Georgetown’s Just Employment Policy, Chon said that he has abided by the policy despite the ongoing lawsuit.
“Yes, we have been following and reporting. We had an incident last year. I think I’m doing a good job. You know, I have those contracts and I will follow them. I will do my best,” Chon said.
The event was planned for Monday in advance of Tuesday’s meeting of the Advisory Committee on Business Practices. The ACBP, composed of university administrators, students and professors, addresses compensation and other workplace issues for contracted and hourly employees.
“It will definitely come up tomorrow in the meeting, and that is when the committee will be actually discussing how to move forward,” Koo said. “It’s basically giving the university a gentle nudge.”
Koo attributed the success of the protest to the turnout and expressed optimism for working conditions at the restaurant in the future.
“We seemed to really have caught [Chon] off guard, which is really good, because the issue will definitely be on his radar now. He’s really going to be thinking about making sure he’s really going to follow the Just Employment Policy. Now that we went in and gave him the petition, he knows that people are watching closely,” Koo said.
Despite student leaders’ optimism, Epicurean and Co. workers were confused about the purpose of the sudden influx of students.
“It’s really sweet. I really appreciated it. But what just happened? What was it about?” an Epicurean worker said.
The worker said she heard about Chon’s lawsuit in the spring but was not aware of any development since then.
GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), who represented student government at the protest, highlighted the process as an important step for more student engagement in lobbying for fair treatment of workers at the university.
“The Just Employment Policy means that workers are a part of our community and that we have the responsibility to make sure they’re being treated fairly,” Tisa said. “It’s great that students are active and caring about the community. The event went well. It sent a clear message, and I have high hopes that positive results will come out of this.”

Georgetown University Medical Center researchers announced in mid-October that they had identified compounds in cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower that have protective features against harmful radiation, which is often used in cancer therapy.
The compound, called DIM (3,3’-diindolylmethane), has previously been studied in the scientific field as a cancer prevention agent, but this is the first time DIM has been found to have protective properties against radiation as well.
The project was funded by GUMC’s Drug Discovery Program and the National Institutes of Health. The study was conducted by oncology professor Eliot Rosen, oncology associate professor Saijun Fan, Radiation Medicine Department Chair Anatoly Dritschilo and Drug Discovery Program Director Milton Brown.
For two weeks, the researchers exposed lethal doses of radiation to rats, and then treated some of the rats 10 minutes later with daily injections of DIM. According to Rosen, all untreated rats died, but over half of the DIM-treated animals remained alive after 30 days.
“This study was designed to see if the compound, DIM, could protect rodents from lethal doses of radiation,” Rosen wrote in an email. “We found that it did.”
The implications of this finding are widespread, as the compound can be used not only in cancer therapy but also in preventing nuclear radiation disasters.
“This could signal a potential beneficial use in humans someday to protect them from the harmful side effects of radiation therapy for cancer or protect humans from a more sinister use of radiation,” Rosen said.
Brown agreed, adding that the discovery could impact space and airline travel with regard to cosmic radiation exposure, public health with regard to nuclear disasters and the government with regard to protecting soldiers.
Although the results of the experiment have not yet been reproduced in human subjects, Rosen said researchers are optimistic that they will be able to study DIM in humans to determine the possibility of the remediation of radiation’s side effects within the next five years.
“This research represents a successful collaboration between basic scientists and the drug discovery team at Georgetown,” Rosen said. “The Georgetown Drug Discovery Program allows us to translate basic science discoveries that can be used to the benefit of human health.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported that a Georgetown University Medical Center study of vegetables’ effects on radiation was funded by agencies within the Department of Defense and the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, in addition to the National Institutes of Health and Georgetown’s Drug Discovery Program. Only the latter two organizations were involved in funding the study. Additionally, the Drug Discovery Program is within GUMC, not the Department of Urology.

Most Georgetown students are familiar with the crowdsourcing platform Kickstarter. Milan Patel (SFS ’14), however, wants to tailor crowdsourcing to Georgetown with UniSprout, a university-specific crowdsourcing website.
Founded by Patel and Jigar Majmundar, a senior at the University of Michigan, last spring, UniSprout is designed to facilitate small alumni donations to support student projects.
The site launched for Georgetown students last month and has been operative at Michigan as of August. Three student projects are currently featured on the website. Seun Oyewole (SFS ’14) and Keegan Carter (MSB ’14) created We Are the Loop, a mobile application designed to show students events taking place in the greater D.C. area in one place. Carter and Oyewole have raised $1,100 from eight donors on UniSprout with 19 days left in their fundraising period. While there is no way to differentiate between alumni and non-alumni donations, Oyewole and Carter know of one alumnus who has donated thus far; the other donors are either friends or anonymous sources.
“It’s very simplistic,” Carter said. “Once you get on, it’s very clear what the purpose of it is.”
Carter and Oyewole plan to use the funds raised on Unisprout to expand their brand and update their mobile application.
Shelby Bartemy (COL ’14) has used the site to promote her own startup, Clean Water H2OYAS, which aims to raise awareness of water scarcity around the world. The group plans to use funds raised through UniSprout to build a second clean water well at the Nyumbani village outside of Nairobi, Kenya, with which it has partnered since 2012.
“[UniSprout] is highly accessible, it’s pretty self-explanatory, they allow you to include a video that explains your cause,” Bartemy said. “It allows potential donors to learn more about your cause in an easily accessible format, rather than having to do a lot of research.”
Thus far, H2OYAS has received $50 from two donors, with 22 days left in its funding cycle. The third project featured on the website is Ed-Strong, which aims to connect universities with the communities around them, giving college students the chance to use what they learn in the classroom to benefit those in neighboring areas. Thus far, Ed-Strong has received $110 from three donors.
Patel drew on lessons from other student-run startups, including Hilltop Consultants, the Hilltop Microfinance Initiative and the Compass Incubator program. He gleaned experience with crowd funding from a now-defunct start up art company that provided affordable, one-of-a-kind art, Art Ouvert, to construct his plan for UniSprout.
“I kind of combined the two,” he said. “If we brought this to the university level, you can bring in alumni to donate directly to students.”
The founders have started developing an initial alumni database. They have also contacted the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative and other crowdsourcing sites for advice.
The site currently requires approval for ideas to be posted, though moving forward, Patel did not foresee an approval system remaining in place.
“Eventually, once we gain enough traction … it will just grow organically,” Patel said. “You can put your ideas up there and if people think it’s a good idea they’ll help you fund it.”
