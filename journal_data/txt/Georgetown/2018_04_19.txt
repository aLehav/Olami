Twenty-two members and two special advisers were selected to serve on the Gender Equity Task Force, a committee created in March 2018 to address issues of gender inequity among the university’s staff and senior leadership, Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia announced April 13.
Jane Aiken, vice dean and professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center, has been selected to lead the 22-member task force. Aiken served on a similar task force at the University of South Carolina and chaired the Arizona Governor’s Task Force on AIDS before coming to Georgetown.
Members of the task force represent the main campus, the Medical Center and the Law Center, as well as a wide array of departments, including the African American Studies department and the oncology department among many others.
Diversity was a key consideration when selecting members for the task force, according to Aiken.
“I’m working closely with President DeGioia to assemble a diverse team of faculty from different disciplines with expertise that would be helpful to this work,” Aiken said in a March interview with The Hoya. “Georgetown is a large and diverse place, and tapping into the broad expertise we have here is both a challenge and an exciting opportunity.”
The task force, which held its inaugural meeting this week, aims to further gender equity among the university’s staff and senior leadership, Aiken said.
Aiken oversaw the selection process, which consisted of meetings with over 100 faculty members and a consultation period. The process concluded with nominations from the faculty senate and official appointments by the president.
The faculty senate is a 75-member governing body that includes faculty members from all three Georgetown campuses. It advises the university on academic, administrative and financial issues, and appoints faculty to other committees including the University Committee on Rank and Tenure, the Grievance Code Committee and the Faculty Responsibilities Committee.
The task force is set to meet once more as a full body before organizing into smaller sub-committees, according to Rachel Pugh, Georgetown’s senior director for strategic communications.
These smaller committees are delving deeper into research that will address the task force’s four main areas of focus: studying practices that have improved gender equity among the Georgetown faculty, assessing how current practices affect gender equity among faculty and senior leadership, recommending steps to improve gender equity among faculty and senior leadership and recommending methods to measure continuing progress.
Rosemary Kilkenny, vice president for institutional diversity and equity, and Lisa Brown, vice president and general counsel for the university, are serving as special advisers to the task force but will remain separate from the general body members because of their current roles in Georgetown’s administration, according to Aiken.
“Rosemary Kilkenny and Lisa Brown have unique expertise to offer in their roles at the university and we look forward to consulting them on a range of topics and will use them as resources to gather additional information and insight,” Aiken wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Because they are involved in the governance of our existing policies, we created special advisor roles to leverage their expertise while maintaining the independence of the task force.”
Kilkenny said she looks forward to the ways this task force will further Georgetown’s commitment to gender equity.
“A great deal of progress has been made toward gender equity at Georgetown,” Kilkenny said. “This task force builds on the efforts of so many community members, who in the past have worked to establish these programs and many others, and gives us the opportunity to do even more.”
Aiken said she is eager to begin her work as a part of the task force.
“We are fortunate to have a number of people who are willing to serve as an advisory group. I hope to work with them over the summer and during the year to gain expertise and insight useful to the work of the task force,” Aiken said.
DeGioia echoed this sentiment in the April 13 news release.
“I am deeply grateful to these members of our University community for their willingness to engage in this effort and share their scholarship and expertise,” DeGioia wrote. “In this moment, we have the opportunity to look ahead to the important and necessary work that remains to achieve greater gender equity in our community.”

A Georgetown University policy requiring student groups to hire campus police for certain on-campus events constitutes a burdensome misuse of Student Activity Fee funds, according to some student leaders.
Current university policy requires student groups to hire Georgetown University Policy Department officers as security guards when hosting high-attendance or high-profile events. Fees and minimum-hours requirements are set by GUPD rather than by event organizers.
GUPD received $10,218.38 in security fees from seven student groups funded through the Student Activities Commission — a club advisory board that allocates funding to over 110 student organizations — for police services at campus events between July 1, 2017 and the end of the fall 2017 semester.
Georgetown administrators maintain that the policy reflects the importance of security to ensure a safe campus and that security fees are not a barrier to groups seeking to host events.
The majority of the budget SAC distributes to student groups, in excess of $325,000, comes from the Student Activity Fee, an $80-per-semester fee paid by students. The commission allocates this funding to student groups through a semesterly budget summit, while also reserving about $150,000 to cover ad hoc requests from student groups who must cover new costs. When a student group requests SAC funds for an event requiring GUPD security, the money comes from the ad hoc reserve from the Student Activity Fee, according to former SAC Chair Ricardo Mondolfi (SFS ’19).
GUPD security fees are therefore a misappropriation of the Student Activity Fee funds because these funds are meant to be spent entirely on students, their events and programming, Mondolfi said.
“The agreement that was reached was that it [the Student Activity Fee] is managed, distributed and spent by students — theoretically on students,” Mondolfi said. “This is money that is from students, supposedly for students, going into the university’s hands.”
Security costs have risen in recent years because of GUPD policy changes. About three years ago, GUPD implemented stricter guidelines requiring clubs to hire an officer to secure events with high expected attendance, or any event deemed to need security at the department’s discretion.
The typical rate for GUPD security is $50.75 per hour for one officer. Event organizers are typically required to hire one officer per 75 attendees, according to GUPD policy, and must hire officers for at least four hours regardless of the length of the event — making $203 the minimum security fee for a single event with high expected attendance.
The newer, more rigorous protocols, which apply to both student and administrative group events, are in response to “world, regional and local events,” according to GUPD’s website.
Erika Cohen Derr, assistant dean for student engagement, said the university’s “top priority is the safety and security of our community.”
“While event organizers are responsible for the cost of security, no one will be prevented from hosting an event due to the cost of security,” Cohen Derr said.
The Center for Student Engagement includes information during student leader training sessions on how to effectively plan for the year, Cohen Derr said. The CSE also helps clubs pay for security when necessary.
Mondolfi and current SAC Chair Kylie Navarro (COL ’20) said the costs of Georgetown Event Management Services fees, which are payments to rent major event spaces on campus, are significant and high.
For example, from July 1, 2017 through February 22, 2018, SAC spent $32,765.82 on GEMS services, in addition to the $10,218.38 spent on police fees.
“You have to wonder, ‘What else could that have gone to?’” Navarro said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s a big source of frustration for us.”
Mondolfi said progress has been made on providing free or inexpensive event spaces for students. For example, spaces in the Healey Family Student Center are free to rent for student groups.
But a lack of engagement on the issue between GUPD, administration and students has led to “astronomical” security costs, Navarro said.
Since the Georgetown University Student Association senate passed a resolution unanimously expressing concerns about the security costs in April 2017, Mondolfi and Hunter Estes (SFS ’19), a former GUSA senator who introduced the resolution, said the administration, GUPD and student leaders have had little discussion about this issue.
While Estes met with GUPD for a preliminary conversation last spring and Mondolfi met with Cohen Derr in the fall to discuss security costs, little concrete action has been taken. GUPD has not worked with the administration to evaluate alternate funding sources for event security, according to GUPD Chief Jay Gruber.
“To date the issue of having the University fund GUPD to staff these events has not been discussed,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Estes also questioned GUPD’s discretion to determine whether an event requires their security and how much the service would cost. Generally, Mondolfi and Gruber both said, a student group is aware if their event will require security and submits an event security request to GUPD. However, the GUPD can ultimately decide whether an event needs security.
“We occasionally reach out to a group hosting an event if they have not notified us,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Estes said he is concerned this policy could deter student groups from hosting events that engage with controversial topics.
“They make very clear in their policy statement online that they reserve full authority to send GUPD officers to any event that they deem of a controversial nature, a controversial topic or anything that could elicit some kind of protest,” Estes said in an interview with The Hoya. “There are a million topics that we should be discussing that, at any given time, could be deemed controversial.”
While Estes also noted he supports security measures, he said student input must be included in future policies and the four-hour minimum for hiring GUPD officers must be re-evaluated.
“No student events, besides conferences, are running for four hours,” Estes said. “You have these hour-long speaking events and they automatically get charged four hours.”
Both Mondolfi and Navarro stressed the complexity for SAC that unpredictable GUPD security costs create.
“We have no way to estimate what their costs will be for events,” Navarro said. GUPD determines the number of officers required to be at events and the length of time for which they are hired , which makes it difficult to properly account for security costs.
SAC-funded groups are not the only student organizations that struggle with GUPD security costs. The Georgetown University Lecture Fund, which often hosts prominent speakers who draw large crowds, has been met with setbacks when trying to meet security costs, according to former Lecture Fund Chair Aiden Johnson (COL ’19).
“In an effort to fund the vital assistance that GUPD provides to our events, the Lecture Fund has often had to allocate significant portions of our budget or appeal to various administrative departments to cover those costs,” Johnson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Eleven Lecture Fund events have required GUPD security since spring 2016, according to Lecture Fund Chair Nicole Heitsenrether (SFS ’19). She said that the Lecture Fund has been able to receive assistance from the administration with GUPD fees.
“The Lecture Fund wants to acknowledge the help and support that both the administration and GUPD have given us, while also recognizing that security costs are a burden that many other student groups face,” Heitsenrether wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Regardless of what steps are taken next, Mondolfi said he does not believe raising the student activity fee is the solution.
“We could use more money for clubs,” Mondolfi said. “Instead of taxing ourselves more, we should find ways to make our current budget more efficient and I think this is one.”
Johnson said leaders of the Lecture Fund hope to work with involved parties to use the student activity fee appropriately.
“We look forward to participating in any upcoming dialogue between student groups, the administration, and the GUPD to find a solution that both equitably and responsibly uses student funds while also respecting GUPD’s financial and logistical needs,” Johnson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
While working with the administration, GUPD and students to find a compromise will take time, Mondolfi said it is a worthwhile effort.
“Even if we fix this today, this wouldn’t kick in until fiscal year ’20,” he said. “But I think we should start.”

This is absolutely disgraceful. I can hire a security guard for $15/hour on Craigslist, not sure that we’re getting $50.75/hour worth of value by having a GUPD officer be the security for an event. I find them rude and slovenly compared to the professional security officers we have as night guards in dorms.

Fascism is on the rise in the United States and could dismantle the nation’s democratic norms, former Secretary of State and Mortara Distinguished Professor of Diplomacy Madeleine Albright said at an event to discuss her new book, “Fascism: A Warning,” on Monday afternoon.
Albright said the books intends to warn readers about the dangers of modern fascism. Albright spoke with School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman before taking questions from the crowd at Monday’s event, which took place in Lohrfink Auditorium.
Albright described a fascist society as one with a leader belonging to a hyper-nationalist “tribal party” who violates civil liberties and uses propaganda techniques to force their message onto the population.
“It’s not easy to define fascism, frankly,” Albright said. “It’s a way of organizing the government in a way to control everybody and really have an opportunity to deliver this message and aggregate power to himself and really undermine democratic institutions.”
A fascist leader is a dictator who presents him or herself to the population as the solution to grievances, according to Albright. The difficulty in defining a fascist is the paradoxical nature of fascism, Albright said.
“A dictator might not become a fascist but a fascist is always a dictator,” Albright said.
Although she said she would not call President Donald Trump a fascist, Albright is concerned by his disrespect toward democratic institutions and belief he is above the law.
“I do think he is the most undemocratic president in history, because the issue here is that he has identified himself in a group and really wonders what the civil liberties are of the other,” said Albright. “There are a number of similar tendencies, but I would not call him a fascist.”
Albright described herself as a “centrist” who believes in compromise. The extreme right and the extreme left, she said, only serve to feed the growing division between the country’s “haves” and “have-nots.”
“The far right and far left is helping to divide the population and what we really should be doing is trying to find common interest and common ground and solve problems,” Albright said. “I believe in government but in order to make it work you do have to have problem solvers that understand common ground.”
When researching the growing fascist leaders around the world, Albright said, she was most surprised that most leaders were either elected or gained their power constitutionally. This revelation points to the grievances of the “have-not” populations across the globe who elect them, according to Albright.
As the title suggests, Albright’s book is a warning against fascism largely based on the historical context around the division between people who feel they are not being heard by their governments.
“I think we can learn from history and the fact that the people who want to become fascists are using the democratic institutions that they have and really manipulating them in a way that they are going to undermine democracy,” Albright said.
Shifting focus to U.S. international relations, Albright said the United States should continue to be involved internationally, as it makes the world safer.
“President Clinton was the first one to use the term ‘indispensable nation,’ but there is nothing about the term indispensable that means alone,” Albright said. “It just means we need to be engaged, so my sense is that America needs to be engaged with others.”
One of Albright’s biggest concerns in today’s America is complacency in responding to threats to democratic norms. Democracy is resilient but fragile, Albright said; she encouraged listeners to take steps to preserve democratic norms, even at the local level of government.
“I do worry that we are complacent, that’s the part that really worries me at the moment,” Albright said. “It took me a long time to find my voice — until I was at a high-level job when I was 55 — and now I’m not going to be quiet.”

A more inclusive hiring process and institutional transparency would improve Students of Georgetown, Inc. and its relationship with the community, employees and leaders of the Georgetown University student-run business said at Tuesday evening’s Corp Town Hall, hosted by the organization’s leadership to reflect on current operations.
The event, which was led by Corp CEO Alex Gong (SFS ’20) and Director of People Operations Lindsey Watson (COL ’19), drew a crowd of about 26 students, most of whom were Corp employees. The event aimed to identify areas of improvement for the student-run business, according to the Facebook event.
The idea for the town hall originated when leaders recognized the number of changes that The Corp has made in recent years, including its decision to go cashless in February and the opening of new storefronts such as Grounded, a coffee shop that opened next to Hilltoss in the Healey Family Student Center in January. Gong hoped that the public forum would create a platform for students to reflect on the recent changes made in the organization and discuss potential future ideas.
“I think over the past two years or so, The Corp has been making a lot of changes to be more inclusive, to be more sensitive and to contribute more positively to the community,” Gong said. “But so far, we have not had any formal public forums through which we can collect feedback and really connect with people on that level.”
Attendees broke into four groups to discuss specific topics: diversity, sensitivity and inclusivity; customer experience; product offerings and affordability; and community relationships. The themes were identified to reflect The Corp’s areas for improvement, Gong said.
“We focused a lot on the internal and external issues that I think are plaguing our company, and we touched upon the issue areas that I think are relevant to the community at large,” Gong said. “We had a lot of productive discussion.”
When the groups debriefed after the discussions, students shared potential problems in the four themes. They then identified steps that can be taken to change operations, a process that yielded new ideas, according to Watson.
“It was helpful to hear some things that we can improve upon and just ideas that we had never thought of ourselves,” Watson said. Going forward, The Corp is “trying to continue to make sure that we’re improving and implementing the things that were said.”
Students who discussed the theme of diversity said The Corp should reassess its hiring process, including making sure that application readers are trained to select a diverse range of applicants. Updating the application process and questions, which have changed little in recent years, would help diversify The Corp and eliminate biases toward hiring, the students said.
Developing a more professionally focused hiring process, rather than a socially focused one, could also help alleviate stereotypes associated with various Corp storefronts, students said.
Enhancing transparency emerged as a solution to increasing diversity and forging stronger relationships with community members, according to the students at the event. One area in which The Corp should increase transparency, according to the students, regards The Corp’s status as a work-study employer: a fact that few students know. Increasing awareness that The Corp offers work-study opportunities would not only be more transparent to the community but could also diversify The Corp’s applicant pool.
Students from multiple discussion groups noted that new-hire training and training throughout the semester could be redeveloped to improve storefront service and the organization as a whole.
Customer service would particularly benefit as a result of better training, the students said. While these improvements could take several forms, ranging from new hires shadowing experienced employees to limiting phone usage during workers’ shifts, attendees said that bettering service could make a difference in day-to-day operations.
Improved training could also benefit affordability. Increased efficiency during shifts would allow storefronts to cut unnecessary shifts and save money — an important consideration, particularly as minimum wage in Washington, D.C., continues to rise.
Watson and Gong both said that they hope to have similar events throughout their time in their positions, which they are set to hold through March 2019.
“One of the biggest takeaways for me from today was making sure that we don’t just wait for people to come to us, but that we go to them, and that we’re making more intentional efforts to reach out to groups and other student leaders to show that we’re really trying to be better,” Gong said.

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority plans to make engine changes to address unexpected engine failures that affected two Metrobuses and led to decision that pulled 164 buses from service March 28.
The buses were moving at speeds under 10 mph when the engine failures occurred, causing two people to sustain minor injuries as automatic brakes kicked in to stop the malfunctioning vehicle. While the other 162 buses in the fleet did not show signs of engine failure, concerns about safety led to their removal from service.
“While we have not yet identified a root cause for the two engine stalls, the experts have made recommendations that could reduce the probability of this type of incident in the future,” Joe Leader, WMATA chief operating officer, said in an April 10 statement.
Experts from New Flyer, the manufacturer of the buses, and WMATA have been testing and examining the buses. The buses are relatively new, having been manufactured mostly in 2015-16, and are still under warranty.
While WMATA uses other bus models from New Flyer, the company believes other models are not affected by the malfunction — only buses operating in the Bladensburg Bus division in northeast Washington, D.C., and the Four Mile Bus division in Arlington, Va., may be at risk according to a March statement from WMATA.
One such recommendation Metro plans to implement is increase the “low idle” setting in the engine from 700 rpm to 800 rpm, according to the statement. Experts hope this setting, which is still within manufacturer recommended limits, would reduce the probability of a stall in the future.
A similar problem plagued buses from North American Bus Industries’ hybrid models in 2014, though those concerns have since been identified and resolved.
Testing is continuing with the use of high-tech monitoring equipment on test runs of the buses under regular conditions, though without passengers. If during these trials buses encounter similar engine problems, the equipment will be able to gather data about a failure and inspectors will be able to examine it.
However, if the test runs proceed without incident, Leader said customers could see the buses return to service in the coming weeks.
The fleet of buses removed from service makes up about 10 percent of the Metrobus force. Although about 80 reserve buses have been employed, they do not fully account for the pulled New Flyer fleet. “More than 1 percent of scheduled daily bus trips have not run” since the incidents, and some customers have experienced delays, according to an April 10 WTOP article.
WMATA has clarified that delays resulting from these safety tests will not be subject to its Rush Hour Promise, which guarantees riders who wait for buses that are more than 15 minutes behind schedule.
“While we know that some bus customers have experienced varying degrees of inconvenience as a result of this process, Metro’s commitment to you is that ‘safety trumps service,’” Leader said.

Solidarity and friendship within communities of color are key to overcoming racial prejudice, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and immigration reform advocate Junot Diaz said at an event hosted by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund on Monday evening.
Diaz is a professor of writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a 2012 recipient of the MacArthur “Genius” Fellowship, awarded annually to individuals in any field for “extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits and a marked capacity for self-direction,” according to the MacArthur Foundation.
The event, held in Lohrfink Auditorium, was cosponsored by the Provost’s Office, the Spanish and Portuguese Department and the American Studies Department.
Diaz was born in the Dominican Republic and immigrated to New Jersey with his family at the age of six. During his childhood, the Dominican Republic was still recovering from the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo. This recovery, along with racism and the importance of “coming into modernity,” or the time at which societies determine what norms and rules of conduct are important to them, have been the recent focus of his art, Diaz said.
“I as an artist have become very much interested in people like myself who enter into modernity explicitly inside of a racial dictatorship,” Diaz said at the event.
The Dominican Republic has suffered a past riddled with racism, making it difficult at times for Dominicans to come to terms with their identity, Diaz said. In 1937, the Dominican Army massacred between 17,000 and 35,000 Haitians in what is now known as the Parsley Massacre.
Diaz is currently working on a book that addresses the uptick in neoliberal racism and the way societies come enter modernity. Neoliberal racism is the idea that we live in a post-racial world, and that the ideas of racism have been completely dismantled or blunted, Diaz said.
“Nowadays I’m thinking about how prophetic the regimes of oppression and exclusion on the island on which I was raised are,” Diaz said. “The violence within the Trujillo regime seems to have been weaponized, if only by coincidence, by the larger powers on our planet.”
“The Dominican Republic is one of the few New World African-descended nations that has an anti-black genocide at the center of its history,” Diaz said.
The idea that racism is no longer a prominent issue has manifested in an increase in white supremacy, Diaz said. Educational institutions that have curtailed their efforts to tackle racism have enabled attitudes of white supremacy to flourish, according to Diaz. The number of extremist hate groups in the United States has increased by four percent since 2016, according to a study by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
“The neoliberal evacuation of public education across the developed West has created an enormous opportunity for opportunistic ideologies like the kinds of white supremacies we are seeing to spread across the U.S., Western Europe and beyond,” Diaz said.
This evacuation is the culmination of the idea that there is no more work to be done with respect to racism, Diaz said.
While white supremacy negatively affects people of all races and religions, neoliberal racism is equally problematic because it means society is overlooking racial tensions, according to Diaz.
“We are in a society that seems less willing to engage in any type of critical race approach but has become much more enamored or addicted to racial oppressive agendas,” Diaz said.
In some ways, the identities of people with different non-white identities have fused into “things which the West fears,” often mobilizing “white supremacy factions and formations to make an argument that their sacred homelands and civilizations are under terrible threat,” Diaz said.
To prevent instances of white supremacy and neoliberal racism, it is important that communities of color band together and demonstrate solidarity with one another, Diaz said. Countries like the Dominican Republic and Brazil have convinced societies that their people are not black so that they cannot gain solidarity around their blackness and gain the power to rebel, according to Diaz.
A product of the confused identities perpetuated by a system of racial governance, the problems of white supremacy can become systemic, regardless of the presence of actual white supremacists, Diaz said.
“We’re just a bunch of white people in colored masks,” Diaz said. “Instead of building our solidarities and understanding that our solidarities are what’s going to overthrow this system, we’re building these wild exclusionary tactics.”
Balancing an identity built upon black culture with the desire to belong in a white environment can be difficult, especially at predominantly white institutions like Georgetown. As a result of this identity struggle, many students feel grief about going to Georgetown or similar institutions, Diaz said. However, Diaz believes this grief can be overcome through friendship.
“Find your dearest friends, people that can hold your pain, and grieve this place,” Diaz said. “Because otherwise it will have done its necessary work, which is to impair the people who are most likely to fix the system.”

“The number of extremist hate groups in the United States has increased by four percent since 2016, according to a study by the Southern Poverty Law Center.”
And the number of alleged “hate groups” listed as “Statewide” on this year’s “Hate Map,” meaning those for which the Southern Poverty Law Center provides NO information for whatsoever, rose from 191 to 297 since 2016, for an increase of 53%. 
We get to take the company’s word for it that these groups really, really exist, with no proof, no location, no membership count, no verification whatsoever. “Trust us!”
That’s not good enough and it certainly isn’t good journalism. Big claims demand big proof, or any proof, for that matter. Prove it or remove it.
Nationwide, according to the SPLC, 28 out of 72 alleged KKK groups are “Statewide,” 91 out of 120 alleged neo-Nazi groups (75%!), 35 out of 100 alleged White Nationalist groups, and a literally incredible 63 out of 71 alleged Racist Skinhead groups are “Statewide” phantoms, or 89% of the number claimed.
https://wp.me/pCLYZ-10c
The article also neglects to mention that, according to this same SPLC, Black and Black Muslim groups have allegedly increased by 402% nationwide, from 48 in 2000 to 241 in 2017, making them far and away the largest category of “hate group” in the U.S. today. 
According claims on the SPLC website, Black “hate groups” in the US increased by 20% last year alone, which would account for 3.9% of the alleged 4% increase nationwide. These are the SPLC’s numbers. This is Mr. Berman’s trusted source.
If the SPLC are going to be your go-to “experts” then you have to accept ALL of their claims, no matter how patently ridiculous they are. The SPLC’s “Hate Map” is designed for fundraising, not fact-finding.
