The White House has changed provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that would have required religious organizations to pay for contraception Jan. 31.
The proposed rules would allow women free access to contraceptives while accommodating the needs of non-profit religious organizations that object to birth control, including universities. Instead of requiring religious institutions to pay for contraception in their health insurance, the new regulation permits females to enroll in a separate no-cost coverage plan for birth control.
Religious organizations can notify their insurers, who will in turn let enrollees know that they are covered under a different individual health insurance policy for contraception.
Insurers and insurer fees are expected to cover the cost of the program.
“Today, the administration is taking the next step in providing women across the nation with coverage of recommended preventive care at no cost, while respecting religious concerns,” Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Friday in a White House press release. ”We will continue to work with faith-based organizations, women’s organizations, insurers and others to achieve these goals.”
The compromise comes after negative feedback last spring from several high-profile religious groups — including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops — that demanded clarification from the government as to what exactly constitutes a religiously affiliated organization. However, many objected to the assertion that faith-based institutions did not have to provide contraceptive coverage. Georgetown Law Center student Sandra Fluke (L ’12), who gained national recognition after political commentator Rush Limbaugh made inflammatory remarks about her, was among those who protested for the right to free birth control.
The changes will be open for public comment through April 8, 2013 after which HHS will confer on the exact language of the law. The administration is expected to finalize the new regulations sometime in August.
“Now that the proposed regulations have been released, Georgetown will be reviewing them carefully,” university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr said.
Jayme Amann (SFS ’15), an intern at the Rosslyn-based nonprofit Feminist Majority Foundation, was concerned that the change to the legislation’s language would make it harder for female students at Georgetown to more easily access contraception access in the near future.
“Although the mandate requires that insurance plans cover employees, this is actually nothing new to Georgetown,” Amann said. “As many of us learned last year with the Sandra Fluke debacle, Georgetown professors are already covered. I think it’s outrageous that Georgetown’s solution to not offering birth control under their student insurance plan is abstinence.”
Georgetown University College Democrats Communications Director Christopher Kraft (SFS ’15) was more optimistic that the compromise would allay the concerns of religious leaders.
“While we wish that religious institutions were prepared to provide comprehensive contraception coverage for those they insure, we believe the Affordable Care Act revision is a suitable compromise resulting from a passionate conflict over the meaning of religious freedom in this pluralistic country,” Kraft said. “We hope that this concession will be sufficient for the country’s more conservative religious leadership.”
Fr. Thomas Reese, S.J., a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center, was also hopeful that the new set of rules would help the administration and its critics reach a middle ground.
“I think it’s very positive that they have fixed the very confusing four part definition of a religious employer,” Reese said. “It also looks like they have figured out how to get free contraceptives to the employees of religious organizations without the involvement of the institutions, so the lawyers are going to have to look at the fine print but hopefully this solves the problem.”
However, Reese added that the temporary resolution on contraception would probably not preclude future battles between the Obama administration and conservatives over the meaning of religious freedom.
“This is just one dispute in the area of religious liberties,” Reese said. “We’ll have to see how the others get resolved.”

An amendment to D.C. law went into effect Tuesday, placing harsher restrictions on disruptive noise and marking a major shift in the Metropolitan Police Department’s ability to crack down on gatherings such as student parties.
The Disorderly Conduct Amendment Act of 2010 states that making unreasonably loud noise between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. is now an offense punishable by 90 days in prison, a $500 fine or both. The maximum fine has doubled from $250.
MPD will now arrest individuals in violation of the noise ordinance, the university’s director of media relations, Rachel Pugh, said on Tuesday. Since 2000, MPD had issued offenders 61D citations, which counted as arrests on record but did not result in detention.
MPD will enforce the law at all D.C. residences, regardless of whether they are university owned or privately leased off campus.
The university was informed of the changes by MPD over the weekend, university spokeswoman Julie Bataille said on Monday, and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson soon began preparing an email to students to update them on the greater severity of this disorderly conduct statute.
“We understand from our local MPD district commander that officers may make an arrest when, in the officer’s judgment, the officer has observed ‘noise that is likely to create a disturbance of the peace,'” Olson said in the email, which was sent out on Wednesday evening.
Olson urged students to stay aware of the strict changes that lie ahead.
“Given that the law and MPD’s plans for enforcing it could have serious implications for you, we wanted to be sure you were alerted to it and to take this opportunity to remind you about the importance of thoughtful, respectful behavior in residential areas off campus at night.”
Moving forward, the university plans on working more with MPD and students to cut back on noise disruptions, disorderly conduct and possible student arrests.
“[We] will continue our many proactive steps to work with students and MPD to address issues before they become a major concern,” Bataille said.

Paul Brigner (LAW ’05, MBA ’11) hasn’t been to class in a while, but it is not because he has been watching movies. Instead, he has been managing the film industry.
Brigner flew to Los Angeles on Tuesday to embark on his new role. He was appointed as senior vice president and chief technology officer for the Motion Picture Association of America on Jan. 10, according to Variety.
The MPAA represents Hollywood’s six largest film studios — The Walt Disney Company, Sony Pictures, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Universal Studios and Warner Bros.
“I think that this chance to represent those great companies and all the great work that they do and the content that they produce is an exciting and fascinating opportunity,” Brigner said.
Since 2008, Brigner has attended the McDonough School of Business’ evening program while working at Verizon as their executive director for internet and technology policy. Though he has no experience in the film industry, Brigner hopes to carry his expertise in policy and technology issues over to his job at MPAA.
“It’s the perfect opportunity for someone like me, because this organization has had [chief technology officers] in the past but this role is [for a] chief technology policy officer because they wanted someone who had done pretty much what I did at Verizon,” Brigner said.
Brigner still plans to graduate in June despite his new position. After all, he has never let a full-time job stand in his way, graduating from Georgetown Law’s evening program in 2005 while working as a technical manager at Verizon.
“I realized I needed to diversify my skills and grow in my career and do something different, something that would be more challenging down the road,” Brigner said.
“I think a lot of people think I’m truly a glutton for punishment [for getting both a law and a business degree], but I’ve always felt that in my mind for my career I wanted to have both,” Brigner added. “I wanted to do something different … to have a more entrepreneurial and more business type of role but still [be] in the policy realm.”
Brigner attributes much of his successful career to his time at Georgetown.
“I certainly wouldn’t have this job if it weren’t for my experiences at Georgetown,” he said.
“Everyone I tell about going to Georgetown Law and the MBA program, they’re always extremely impressed.”
However, Brigner had to work hard to balance his academic work with his jobs and his family.
“It was always a bit of a struggle, it was never easy. For a good deal of the time I’ve been at school, I missed out on family obligations and all that goes along with it. It helps learning how to multitask, how to juggle a lot of different responsibilities,” he said. “It’s been a long road, going through two evening programs at Georgetown, but I couldn’t be happier about it.”
