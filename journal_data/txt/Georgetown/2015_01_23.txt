The Center for Investments and Social Responsibility has yet to release the results of their Jan. 16 vote on divestment, leading members of GU Fossil Free to release an open letter urging CISR to respond promptly.
CISR Chair James Feinerman released a statement on the day of the scheduled vote explaining that the committee required more time before making their final recommendation.
“The Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility today had a thoughtful and engaged discussion on the Fossil Free proposal and is making progress. We continue to finalize our work and will make a public statement when our deliberations are complete,” Feinerman wrote.
Members of CISR declined to comment about the vote after Jan. 16. Additionally, the university has not commented on the delay of the vote.
GU Fossil Free released an open letter Jan. 22 admonishing CISR for its slow response.
“As of January 22 the CISR has not made public the minutes of this meeting, their final decision on GUFF’s proposal, or a specific date of release for the result of their vote,” the letter, signed by the GU Fossil Free Coalition, said. “We write this letter to communicate our expectations regarding CISR’s decision, in light of the CISR’s role in ensuring that Georgetown fully carries out its responsibilities to social justice and the common good.”
The letter also reiterates the organization’s rationale for divestment. GU Fossil Free member Patricia Cipollitti (SFS ’15) helped draft the letter and said that she hopes it will galvanize a quick response from CISR.
“We felt the need to speak with the Georgetown community about our expectations for the CISR vote and just present our rationale for divestment in terms once more and put it forth and put that in the context of the CISR vote and its results,” Cipollitti said. “We hope that other folks will join on board and support us.”
CISR’s vote came after months of negotiations between GU Fossil Free, CISR and the administration to address the issue of divestment. GU Fossil Free’s divestment proposal calls for the university to divest its holdings from the 200 largest fossil fuel companies.
CISR, which consists of 12 voting members, will give its recommendation on divestment to the university’s board of directors during its meeting in February.
In November, University President John J. DeGioia met with GU Fossil Free and informed them that CISR would give their recommendation on divestment in January, as opposed to the end of the academic year.
Regardless of the recommendation given by CISR, GU Fossil Free will be present at the board of directors’ meeting to voice their support for divestment.
Before CISR’s meeting on Friday, GU Fossil Free organized a rally outside of the McShain Lounge in order to urge CISR to vote in favor of divestment.

At the rally, GU Fossil Free organized a mock call-and-response wedding ceremony between GU Fossil Free and CISR, which included the exchanging of vows and rings. The ceremony was framed as a symbolic marriage between CISR and Georgetown’s values as an environmentally conscious university.
The rally participants sang common chants, such as “This is what democracy looks like” and “Hey CISR, it’s time that you deliver.” During the mock wedding ceremony, they also chanted “I do.” One passerby made an obscene hand gesture at the group during the protest.
GU Fossil Free and CISR member Caroline James (COL ’16) spoke to approximately 20 protesters about the significance of divestment.
“I want to see clean energy that’s available to everyone,” James said. “It made me sad to think that my education was being paid for by investments in fossil fuel companies. Why am I fighting against climate change when my education is being paid for by the people who perpetuate it?”
During the rally, James said that she did not expect CISR to vote in favor of full divestment.
“I’m anticipating that the members of CISR will divest in some capacity. I’m predicting it will be a recommendation to divest from the worst actors,” James said. “I don’t foresee them saying yes to full divestment. Even if it’s a partial yes, we are going to be disappointed without a full yes.”
Maxwell Menard (SFS ’16) said he joined the protest to demonstrate student support for GU Fossil Free.
“We want to make sure [to show CISR] that there’s large student support in favor of divestment,” Menard said.
Theo Montgomery (SFS ’18) said that another reason for divestment was the instability of fossil fuel companies’ performance on the stock market, citing the recent decrease of oil prices.
“I think this price drop has shown the volatility of oil prices, and even with how high oil production is, it is still subject to such incredible drops,” Montgomery said.

After years of unchecked sewage flowing into the Potomac River, President Lyndon B. Johnson called the river “a national disgrace” in 1965. Although efforts to clean up the river have improved the quality of the water, continued concerns about its cleanliness prompted conservationists to add a little sparkle to the muddy water.
The cleanliness of the Potomac has long been an issue, exacerbated by the doubled flow of the District’s raw, partially treated sewage into the river between 1932 and 1956, according to the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin.
Potomac Conservancy President Hedrick Belin described the state of the Potomac in the 1960s.
“If you came up the Potomac toward Georgetown from the national airport, in August, between Georgetown and the Kennedy Center there’d be a solid green mat of algae that your boat would have to go through,” Belin said.
Johnson’s 1965 proclamation catalyzed an effort to conserve waterways nationwide and culminated in the Clean Water Act of 1972, which increased funding for the sewage system and marked a turning point in pollution prevention.
“A large result of the Clean Water Act [is that] there’s been a 40-year focus … of investing millions of dollars in updating sewer treatment plants,” Belin said.
Despite this progress, pollution remains a major issue. A 2014 report titled “State of the Nation’s River,” released by the Potomac Conservancy, expressed worry about continued contributors to river pollution, including aging sewage infrastructure and the disappearance of healthy forests, which prevent runoff.
Sewage remains the largest pollution contributor; there are around 40 locations where sewage could release a staggering amount of bacteria and waste during periods of rainfall.
Swimming in any of the rivers or streams in the District is illegal. The sole exception to this law is the nation’s Triathlon, though even this event has been cancelled twice in recent years because of hazardous levels of sewage in the water.
Maxwell Menard (SFS ’16), a member of the Georgetown crew team, described some of the problems that he has encountered with the Potomac.
“I don’t think we’ve had any health issues because of the Potomac, but we do run into debris. … Garbage, a lot of big logs, also a deer carcass once, it’s a pretty steady amount of debris and garbage,” Menard said. “We just take it as part of the river, we don’t really question it.”
Additionally, Belin explained that the state of the river continues to have a unnatural effect on the river’s bass, causing more than 80 percent of the male smallmouth bass to lay eggs.
“It’s interfering with their biological systems, which is clearly a canary in the coal mine,” Belin said.
Belin’s organization is at the forefront of attempts to protect the river. The Potomac Conservancy, founded in 1993 by a group of kayakers that Belin described as a “merry band of river warriors,” encourages local policymakers to create smart planning that will contribute to river health.
“We’re seeing a lot more green roofs on buildings to capture the rain water where it falls … using materials that allow the rainwater to percolate in the ground rather than having it run off their driveways,” Belin said.
In a similar vein, the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority began implementing a $2.6 billion Clean Rivers Project to reduce 96 percent of the sewage overflow in the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers and Rock Creek by 2025, a target that exceeds both Environmental Protection Agency requirements and the systems of other major cities.
The project will overhaul the sewer system of about one-third of the region, which features pipes that are insufficiently equipped to handle large rainstorms. D.C. Clean Rivers Project Director Carlton Ray said the ambitious project is feasible.
“It’s a very high capture rate, we understand, but we feel like our rivers and streams are worth it,” Ray said.
Ray added that D.C. residents will see noticeable improvements in the cleanliness of the city’s waterways, as portions of the project will be completed in the next few years.
“Ultimately we need to continue to build the tunnel system up into the northeast part of the district to help with the Anacostia, but it will be dramatically improved in the near term by 2018 once we finish the tunnel system up to RFK stadium,” Ray said.
Belin stressed the necessity of making smart choices in the future to protect the river and to allow both conservation and progress.
“I think supporting our region’s growth and restoring the Potomac is not mutually exclusive, but it’s going to take a lot of work,” Belin said.

Bread for the City Director George Jones received the 2015 John Thompson Jr., Legacy of a Dream Award at the annual Let Freedom Ring Celebration on Monday evening at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
The event featured performer Natalie Cole who was accompanied by the Let Freedom Ring Celebration Choir.
Jordan Blackwell (COL ’15), a student selected to open the event, spoke about his gratitude for Martin Luther King Jr.
“Lord, if I could have just one prayer it would be thank you,” Blackwell said. “Thank you for the opportunity to celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Thank you for his courage to take the first step without seeing the whole staircase, which caused ripples of justice throughout the globe.”
Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter and Target group Vice President Lydia Diaz spoke following Blackwell’s invocation. Both women spoke about the ways in which the Kennedy Center and Target are following in King’s legacy by their commitment to service.
Next the Let Freedom Ring choir, directed by Reverend Nolan Williams, performed an original composition titled “I Got a Right to Vote.” Williams, who has conducted the choir for 12 years, is commissioned by Georgetown University annually to write or arrange a composition that captures the meaning and purpose of the gathering.
“[My composition] commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, but it also captures, I think, the spirit of civil unrest that we are experiencing throughout this country as people of good will stand up to demand equality from our justice system,” Williams said. “It is my hope that you will not only recognize your right, but you will exercise your right.”
Williams then conducted “We Shall Overcome,” which was commissioned in 2006 for the Let Freedom Ring Celebration. The song, which became the anthem of the Civil Rights Movement, was sung at the dedication of the MLK memorial in D.C. in 2011. A commemorative recording of the song was also played on NASA’s newest spacecraft Orion, which last month completed a successful test flight that was the first step toward an eventual manned mission to Mars and an asteroid.
“As we were standing there watching this space craft about to go further than any space craft has gone in some 40 years through our space program I kept thinking about protests underway from Ferguson to Cleveland, from New York to L.A,” Williams said. “And then I thought about the irony of Orion carrying as a part of its cargo the civil rights anthem ‘We Shall Overcome’ … with this message, ‘We shall live in peace someday.’ What a powerful reminder that is to us all.”
After the performance, University President John J. DeGioia was welcomed to the stage to speak about the John Thompson, Jr. Legacy of a Dream Award, named after the former basketball coach who led the team from 1972 to 1999. Thompson grew up in the projects in Washington, D.C., and after leading his high school to multiple championships, he earned a scholarship to Providence College and went on to play for the NBA Celtics.
“I think it’s more important in life for those kids when they leave here and they use the good education they got here at Georgetown and they go out in the world and apply what they did and they try to help someone else or try and educate someone else,” Thompson said in a video played at the event.
This year’s Legacy of a Dream Award recipient, George Jones, has served as the chief executive officer at Bread for the City, an organization that provides services including food, clothing, medical care, legal and social services for vulnerable members of the community. Bread for the City has been operating in D.C. for almost 20 years.
“Every day hundreds of people walk through our centers looking for help,” Jones said in the video. “We fight poverty with a sense of dignity, respect, justice and service.”
Since Jones joined Bread for the City as CEO in 1996, the organization has grown to employ 100 staff members at two centers, serving nearly 33,000 D.C. residents each year. Leonard Edwards, currently a client advocate at Bread for the City, was one of the thousands that the organization provided aid to.
“A place like Bread for the City gives you a voice. A place like Bread for the City allows you to keep your pride — allows you to stop the dissention into poverty,” Edwards said in a video played at the event.
Natalie Cole closed out the ceremony with her performance of several hits, including “This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)” and a rendition of “Unforgettable” set to a video of her father, the late Nat King Cole. She dedicated the song “I Miss You Like Crazy” to Dr. King.
“There is a song [“I Miss You Like Crazy”] with a lyric that expresses our feelings about people that have gone before us, either left us with a great legacy or left us with great thoughts, great moments, that we can be proud of,” Cole said. “I would like to say that I think we miss Dr. King. We miss his voice. We miss his energy, his spirit.”

More than 500 Georgetown students rallied together to raise over $5,000 to purchase Fr. Richard Curry, S.J., a golf cart at a fundraiser dubbed “Golf Cart Throw Down” on Jan. 15 at Malmaison.
Three students in Curry’s “Theater and the Catholic Imagination” class planned the event and aim to raise $10,000 in order to buy the golf cart. They will continue fundraising and propositioning alumni for donations until they reach this goal.
Curry founded the Dog Tag Bakery, located off of Wisconsin, with the intent of giving veterans suffering from disabilities and unemployment a job and opportunity. Having developed an ailment over winter break for which he is currently hospitalized, a street-legal golf cart would allow Curry to commute to the bakery. The cart will be used not only to transport Curry when he is released from the hospital, but will also deliver goods from the bakery to the Georgetown area to bolster the bakery’s current delivery service.
The university will not provide a golf cart for Curry, but it currently owns a fleet of 40 E-Z-Go brand golf carts for local travel only, which cost from $3,000 to $5,000, less than half of the cost of a street-legal golf cart.
The fundraiser featured drinks, dancing and DJ-ing from Jamie Sharp (COL ’15) and Sim Allan (MSB ’15). The event organizers used Palander, an event calendar for Georgetown students, to reach more than 1,000 students.
“$10,000 is a lot of cash for Georgetown to part with, even if it is for a worthwhile cause, so I, along with some other guys in the class thought why not try to get together and see if we could raise the money ourselves to help him pay for this?” Sharp said. “Why not just put on a party and see if we can get people to chip in and donate?”
Martha Strautman (COL ’18) said she appreciated the creative method of fundraising.
“I think that the event went really well and it’s great that Georgetown students can find such unique and fun way to support a good cause,” Strautman said. “I think that the event was representative of the larger balance Georgetown has between community service and helping others, while knowing how to have fun.”
The $5,000 was raised through both donations and drinks. Malmaison kept a portion of the bar earnings, but gave the student organizers discounted rates on the staff and security members. Sharp said he plans to sit down with Curry to plan ways to raise the final $5,000.
“We’ve had people who didn’t even come to the event donating $20, $50 each,” Sharp said. “You can really see the loyalty he has from his students. He really is one of those guys who has a lot of personal connections with people. He cares a lot about students even if they haven’t taken his class.”
Matthew Fried (COL ’16) attended the event and said that the party was an effective way of raising money.
“As people enjoying that kind of fundraising method, it was definitely successful,” Fried said. “People went primarily for the party of course, but I think people were excited that they could do that while also supporting someone who is so fundamental to the Georgetown community.”
However, Fried said that he was unsure as to why the university was unable to purchase a golf cart for Curry.
“Each of us pays $60,000 a semester and the university can’t afford to take care of Father Curry’s $10,000 golf cart,” Fried said. “This man embodies the spirit of Georgetown and for them to ignore him is simply ungrateful. I’m glad the students could come together here.”
Curry said he was thrilled with the student engagement. However, he hopes that this event raises more awareness about the Dog Tag Bakery.
“[The publicity from the event] was my dream come true because I really want the undergraduate students at Georgetown to bond with Dog Tag Bakery, as it is really an amazing Georgetown-sponsored enterprise,” Curry said.
Curry said that his true desire is to connect Georgetown students with disabled veterans.
“My real desire was for undergraduates to meet the disabled veterans because first, they are their own age,” Curry said. “And second, it is important to realize that war has a cost. To see so many students respond to this call is so amazing and really shows that the undergraduates are becoming men and women for others — which warms the Jesuit heart, let me tell you.”

President Barack Obama discussed his recently revealed plan to guarantee two free years of community college for all qualifying students along with new methods of student loan relief during the State of the Union address Tuesday night.
“[Middle class economics] is preparing working Americans to work for higher wages.” White House Deputy Press Secretary Jennifer Friedman said Wednesday in a conference call with college media outlets. “Some of the proposals … that the president has been rolling out [are] making two years of community college free for responsible students, making student loans more affordable, partnering with businesses to talk about on-the-job training and apprenticeship opportunities.”
The primary proposal from the president to provide college tuition relief involved simplifying the tax code. White House Domestic Policy Director Cecilia Muñoz explained that the current system of college tax incentives was complex, preventing families from fully taking advantage of the system.
“There is a whole host of different ways to pay for college and different ways to get federal support in paying for college. And it ends up being bewildering and complex. … So the president is proposing to consolidate these systems,” Muñoz said. “The idea is to make sure that our system works and is accessible.”
According to Muñoz, the Government Accountability Office found that 27 percent of families who claimed a tax credit should have claimed a different one, while another 14 percent did not claim a benefit despite being eligible. The White House estimates that the plan would cut taxes for around 8.5 million students and provide up to $2,500 of assistance yearly.
Obama also announced his community college program, which would provide tuition-free classes to students who can maintain a 2.5 grade point average and are either making progress towards a technical degree or working towards transferring to a four-year institution.
Muñoz explained that the plan would improve the United States work force, citing that two-thirds of job openings require technical skills and post-secondary education experience.
“The proposal to make community college free for every responsible student is really based on the notion that, 100 years ago, when we made high school free and universal, it created the best-educated workforce in the world here in the United States and that related to how we led the world economically in the 20th century.” Muñoz said.
McCourt School of Public Policy Professor E.J. Dionne applauded the plan in his biweekly column for The Washington Post, praising community colleges as “central to restoring social and economic mobility,” referencing research by MSPP Professor of public policy Harry Holzer that pointed to the need for a college degree to gain a competitive wage.
However, Holzer was more critical of the plan. While he liked the minimum GPA requirement and the emphasis on either further education or employment, he questioned whether the monetary resources could be better used to support students.
“Most of the money will not go to the most needy people who already have Pell grants,” Holzer said. “Most of the money will go to middle class people who could maybe afford this expenditure already.”
He also worried that it would affect the educational outcomes of students would potentially choose to attend community colleges first instead of four-year colleges, noting a discrepancy between four-year and community college education.
“I worry that if community college is free and four year schools are not free… people who could go to good four-year schools will now start at community college and they won’t do as well,” Holzer said. “They won’t get the same level of guidance, the same level of instruction, so it could end up hurting educational outcomes for the people it’s trying to help.”
Muñoz disagreed, claiming that more students would have the opportunity to receive a four-year degree through the program.
“In order to qualify for free tuition, you have to show that you’re in a program to transfer to a four-year institution or an occupational program with a really good track record,” Muñoz said. “We think more people will be getting credits toward a four-year degree and then more people will be getting a four-year degree.”
Holzer noted that the program will likely have a marginal impact on private universities like Georgetown, primarily affecting second-tier state universities, who might see students choose to attend community colleges instead.
“People would not stop going to Georgetown to go to community college,” Holzer said. “What I imagine would happen would be people who would otherwise go to other state colleges, not the flagship schools but the second-tier schools, will now instead start at community colleges so they’re the ones that I would more worry about, not so much the ‘Georgetowns.’”
Beyond his concerns about the program itself, Holzer remained skeptical about the possibility of the program being implemented on the federal level but saw the potential for states.
“The Republicans control Congress, and most of them have not reacted really well to this idea,” Holzer said. “Individual states might choose to go that way. … You can compare what happens to the states that do this in comparison to the states that don’t and test out my hypothesis.”

Congressman Seth Moulton (D-MA) spoke about his campaign, goals for his term and problems facing Congress Wednesday in Riggs Library. The event, moderated by the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy Director Ambassador Barbara Bodine, was the second of the ISD’s Distinguished Practitioners Discussion Series.
Moulton was sworn into Congress Jan. 6, 2015 after serving as a U.S. Marine for four combat tours in Iraq and receiving degrees from Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of Government.
Bodine began the discussion by summarizing problems currently facing Congress.
“I think there’s little debate from the right or the left that our governing structure is not working exactly as we might hope, and that’s both within the legislative branch and within the executive branch, and certainly between them as well,” Bodine said.
According to Bodine, American citizens have begun to ask questions about both the effectiveness and make-up of Congress.
“Some of the questions that get raised are: Is congress truly representative any longer? Is it too dominated by money? Is it dominated by an aging and entrenched leadership? Does it need more veterans and others who pay the price for the decisions that are made?” Bodine said.
Moulton then spoke about his road to Congress, which did not begin until college, where he developed an interest in service.
“I looked at lots of different options [after college at Harvard University],” Moulton said. “I looked at the Peace Corp, I looked at teaching over seas, but at the end of the day I had so much respect for the 18- and 19-year-old kids who serve on the front lines of our nation’s military, that I said, ‘I’d like to do my part in this too.’”
While serving in the Marines, Moulton said that he began to discover how the politics in D.C. affected the people around him.
“Over the course of those four tours in Iraq, I felt that I saw some of the consequences of failed leadership in Washington,” Moulton said. “I think Congress didn’t know what they were doing when they got us into Iraq, and they didn’t have our backs while we were there. There was actually a day in 2004 when a young Marine in my platoon looked up at me at the end of a tough day and said, ‘You know sir, you oughta run for Congress so this doesn’t happen again.’”
Moulton defeated the incumbent congressman in his district for the first time in 22 years. He attributed his victory to his campaign, which championed bipartisanship.
“My message was that Congress is too partisan and that we need to be willing to work across the aisle… I think it resonated with people,” Moulton said. “And I think people on both sides of the aisle and even that small set of Americans who actually get out and vote at primaries recognized that hyper-partisanship is a real problem in Congress today.”
After just two weeks in Congress, Moulton said that although he is still learning, he has noticed a few problems he will face throughout his term.
“I’ve been in Congress two weeks so I know all the answers,” Moulton joked. “I’m still figuring out where the bathroom is. But, what I have done already is to make a proactive effort to reach out to people on the other side of the aisle. I’ve been surprised by how much the institution is set up to discourage that.”
According to Moulton, the Congress orientation provides little opportunity for cross-party mingling.
“Every time we went out in the evenings to socialize and meet our new friends, it was divided by party,” Moulton said. “I would say 95 percent of the events in that eight days were divided by parties, so we barely had an opportunity to meet people on the other side of the aisle.”
Moulton said that although this separation was discouraging, he has hope for the congressmen of the newest generation.
“I think it’s very important that we get new blood into Congress,” Moulton said. “I have a lot of hope for our generation, the younger Americans because I think we are more pragmatic, more service-oriented. I think we’ve seen the results of an incredibly divided generation in our parents. So, I’m hopeful, but it’s going to take a lot of work, and fundamentally, it takes more people with this attitude.”
Matthew Censullo (COL ’18), one of Moulton’s constituents, said that Moulton’s commitment to service inspired him as he watched the campaign unfold.
“I have followed his campaign pretty significantly, even while I was in D.C,” Censullo said. “I was very excited when I heard that he was coming, and I was on board with a lot of his policies and platform ideas and just wanted to meet him in person and hear what he had to say. I was definitely inspired by him.”
Another constituent, Brian Poirier (MSB ’17), said that he appreciated how Moulton connected his experiences in Iraq to his service as a congressman.
“He spoke at length about the role of being a veteran and how it played an integral role in working in Congress, so it was something that I was really excited to hear about tonight. … His talks on service leadership were really genuine because of all of the experiences that he’s had,” Poirier said. “Now, he’s really interested in taking those experiences and applying them to working in this Congress.”

Tori Hideshima (COL ’15) did not know much about graphic design until this fall. But after only a semester in Professor L. Collier Hyams’ Intro to Graphic Design class, her artwork will be featured in a Mazda display at the Washington Auto Show, which opens today.
“You’ll walk in and you’ll look down and you’ll see all these cars, and I expect that Tori’s car is going to scream off the floor because it’s so wild and bright,” Hyams said.
The car art Hideshima designed was part of a competition within Hyams’ class and sponsored by Mazda that challenged the Intro to Graphic Design students to create concept art for a five-door Mazda 3. The only requirement was to in some way celebrate the opening of the company’s new auto factory in Salamanca, Mexico.
One hundred designs, five from each student in the class, were submitted with themes drawing inspiration from the Aztecs, Mexican fabric patterns, Day of the Dead and textile art. Hideshima’s winning design was a mesh between modern art and Aztec art.
“It’s beautiful,” Mazda spokeswoman Tamara Mlynarczyk said of Hideshima’s design. “It’s very vibrant and the colors are just very celebratory of the enthusiasm of the people who are now working in that plant.”
Hyams’ class spent weeks working on researching Mexican culture and coming up with drafts designs. The final designs were submitted mid-December and the winners were announced in early January. Mazda’s director of design narrowed the 100 options down to a field of 10, from which employees chose the top three winning designs.
Holly DiClemente (COL ’15) won second place with a design inspired by floral textiles and Olivia Huppman (COL ’15) received third place for her design featuring elements from Day of the Dead.
“We spent a lot of time on this project,” Hideshima said. “We went through looking at a lot of styles and artwork and we did a research project looking at different art cars because BMW has a lot of really famous artists who do art cars every year.”
Hyams’ class has produced a number of design projects including an 18-car series of student art sponsored by BMW and the contest that produced the artwork for the new Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle bus fleet. Although the class has only been in existence for about two years, students have produced hundreds of potential designs for real-life projects, opening the opportunity for future graphic design jobs. Olivia Duff (COL ’16), the artist whose winning art now adorns the exterior of the new GUTS buses, recently received a design job as a result of her artwork, according to Hyams.
Hyams said that the idea for his project-based graphic design course originated with his own experience in college in which he could never take classes that provided applicable experience for the real world.
“I build classes that are basically reflective of the classes I would have wanted to take when I was in school,” Hyams said. “In most cases the schools I went to didn’t have anything that nearly related to the stuff I was interested in.”
Once Hideshima’s car finishes its debut at the auto show, it may make some other stops around the District before the vinyl wrap with the artwork is eventually removed and the car is sold to a dealership.
Until then the car will be displayed at the Washington Auto Show, which runs from today until Feb. 1 and will feature a student day on Monday during which tickets will be discounted to $7 for students.
Hyams said that he has another car project in the works along with a project that will task students with creating designs for phones.
Tamara Mlynarczyk, the spokeswoman for Mazda, said that the company was happy with the partnership with Hyams’ class and hopes for another project in the future.
“I hope that we maybe get to do this again and pick a different theme,” Mlynarczyk said. “It was really interesting getting to see what the different students came up with. And I didn’t even see all of the art.
We just had it whittled down to the top ten. But they were all so creative. It will be interesting to see where the students end up.”
Ultimately, Hyams said that he hopes to facilitate student excitement about art and expose student’s to careers in graphic design.
“We’re in a period of time where students that are interested in art are scared of art because they think they can’t make any contribution to their future career,” Hyams said. “I mean that’s true in certain cases, but I think we’ve been able to redirect that idea a little bit. It certainly makes us proud.”
Hideshima is a perfect example of how Hyams sees students applying the skills they learn in his class to their future careers. She said she plans on taking her new-found graphic design skills to the business world.
In the meantime Hideshima is enjoying the surprise and excitement of being featured at the Washington Auto Show and plans on taking her family to see her car art in person.
“It was really a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” Hideshima said.

Georgetown students will enjoy an extra two days of rest during the next academic year because of a scheduling phenomenon that occurs once every seven years.
The 2015 winter break will last a total of 21 days, up from the 19-day break that students received following the fall 2014 semester. The number of days in the spring semester, however, will remain unchanged.
The fall 2015 semester will begin Sept. 2 and conclude Dec. 22 and the spring 2016 semester will commence Jan. 13 and end May 9.
Classes at Georgetown are required by the Registrar Office’s policy to begin the Wednesday before Labor Day and conclude the week prior to Commencement Weekend, which ends the week before Memorial Day. But unlike 2014 when Labor Day fell on Sept. 1, the earliest possible day, it falls on Sept. 7 during the next academic year, the latest possible day.
University Registrar John Q. Pierce said that this shortening of the fall semester has precedent. When planning the academic calendar, he looks back over the past 25 years to see which of the years most closely align to the upcoming year. Using the old calendar as a starting point, Pierce designs the new calendar, scheduling for three-day weekends, an add/drop period and holidays while attempting to keep the number of class days per semester constant.
“The draft is constructed based on the previous-like years when the dates for Memorial Day and Labor Day were the same as in the year that we’re trying to plan for,” Pierce said. “We apply the same template for the new year.”
Pierce said that although the schedule looks significantly altered, it follows specific protocol that keep the number of in-class days constant.
“[Our] starting point is attempting to maintain continuity from year to year so that there are no surprises for people,” Pierce said. “What appears to be a change is simply following the standard formula for calendars.”
The Registrar’s Office plans each calendar two years ahead so that students, faculty and staff may have them as early as possible. Pierce said that while no major changes are occurring the next academic year or the year after, there have been talks in the past of changing the template slightly.
“There was a discussion about starting school after Labor Day instead of before Labor Day,” Pierce said.
The last major change to the template occurred ten years ago when the decision was made to move graduation from Memorial Day weekend to the weekend before it.
“For a variety of reasons, people thought that [graduation] should be the weekend before Memorial Day,” Pierce said. “That required redoing the start of the spring [semester].”
Students appear happy with the calendar shift next year, but many said they still want to see longer breaks.
“I would love to have a longer winter break or a longer Thanksgiving,” Brittany Logan (MSB ’18) said. “My friends at home have more time off.”
This academic year, Georgetown had a shorter winter break, at 19 days, than many of its peer institutions such as Yale University (20 days), Boston College (21 days), Stanford University (23 days) and the University of California, Berkeley (24 days).
Melissa Lou Martin (COL ’16) said that the two extra days over winter break will help students relax more after a stressful examination period.
“I think there needs to be a healthy middle ground,” Martin said. “My break in high school was way too short, but some of my friends at state schools have way too long of a break. I would go crazy. I think the registrar is on the right track — we need to have the chance to decompress and get a break from Georgetown without it being too long.”

The new storefront Dog Tag Bakery, which opened on Grace Street in December, supports veterans’ reintegration to civilian life through a work-study program in partnership with Georgetown University. It offers veterans the chance to practice business skills and take courses in pursuit of a certificate in business administration from the university.
Founded by Director of the Georgetown Academy for Veterans Fr. Richard Curry, S.J. and local business owner Connie Milstein, the bakery is a non-profit organization focused on helping veterans. The opening in December was the culmination of an idea eight years in the making.
Dog Tag’s director of public relations and media for the bakery RaeAnn Pickett, said both Curry, who trained as a baker with the Jesuits, and Milstein share a love of baking and a conviction that no veteran who wants to work and pursue his or her career goals should be unemployed.
“The two things that both of our co-founders bring to the table really are what make Dog Tag such a unique place,” Pickett said.
The bakery offers workers a certificate program in business administration through the Georgetown Center for Continuing and Professional Education in the School of Continuing Studies. Its storefront includes a bakery, a kitchen and classroom space for workers to take classes.
“The bakery itself is a training ground for small business and entrepreneurship. We provide a great education through Georgetown and a great job opportunity through business, which is the bakery,” Chief Operating Officer Megan Ogilvie said.
The business administration curriculum, customized to the bakery and its employees, consists of nine courses, including accounting, management, communication, corporate finance, marketing, business policy and entrepreneurship. Employees must complete all requirements in order to receive a certificate, learning all aspects of a small business, such as business and staff management, product creation, customer service, marketing and operations.
Pickett emphasized the work-study focus of Dog Tag Bakery and its benefits for veterans and families.
“They go to lectures and take regular course loads as any student of the School of Continuing Studies would, but they’re also going to the bakery and learning how to bake and run a business,” Pickett said.
The current bakery staff consists of 18 people, and the current non-profit staff consists of four people. The first set of workers entered the program June 2014 and received their certificates in a ceremony at McGhee Library on Nov. 20. Dog Tag will take in its next set of members this coming spring.
“We have a mix of veteran, military civilians, and regular civilians as employees, but everyone in the program is either a veteran with a disability or the spouse of a veteran with a disability,” General Manager Justin Ford, an Army veteran of Iraq and Kosovo, said.
The proceeds from the bakery are reinvested in the education program in order to reach out to as many veterans as possible. Additionally, customers can add their own dog tag to the bakery in order to reach out to as many veterans as possible.
The bakery itself has a wide variety of goods on its menu, including breakfast pastries, breads, soups, salads, sandwiches, quiches, desserts, snacks and beverages.
Ford also said that the bakery’s business has been doing very well.
“Sales have gone up each month; there’s been a steady increase since day 1,” Ford said.
Alex Patti (COL ’18) said she is looking forward to visiting the bakery soon.
“I’ve heard about the mission behind the bakery, and I’m definitely going to check it out, especially because the food is supposed to be great. Maybe it will become my new study spot,” Patti said.

In an effort to inform the student body of the wide range of contraceptive and sexual health resources available to them, H*yas for Choice put up 700 “Know Your Options” stickers in campus bathrooms this week that direct students to their informational blog.
Unlike the university-sponsored stickers in bathrooms that lead students to Student Health Services, the H*yas for Choice stickers provide more comprehensive options.
“Obviously, [the university is] not going to tell you about contraception. They’re not going to tell you where abortion clinics are,” H*yas for Choice President Abby Grace (SFS ’16) said. “They’re only going to tell you one side of the story.”
While Grace conceded that the university does make “genuine efforts” to help pregnant students, she said that students are not given the full range of options.
The H*yas for Choice website lists birth control methods, abortion resources in the D.C. area and sexual assault resources on and off Georgetown’s campus. It also lists place that test for sexually transmitted infections testing in D.C.. Students are able to see the price of each of these resources on the website.
The blog also warns students of Crisis Pregnancy Centers. Anti-abortion advocates operate these clinics, found in cities across the country. They are not legitimate medical establishments, and these centers have come under fire for providing false information and misleading pregnant women in an effort to prevent them from having an abortion.
The pamphlet includes information on how to contact Georgetown Health Services, but Grace said that it is dangerous for the university to assume that all students adhere to Catholic beliefs on these issues.
“If you’re putting up stickers that only direct you to one side of the story, then you should simultaneously have information on the full picture,” Grace said. “That’s where the ‘Know Your Options’ tagline comes from.”
H*yas for Choice Vice President Vincent DeLaurentis (SFS ’17) elaborated on the mission behind the stickers.
“We found that it was necessary to put these up because we know that Student Health is limited in the types of resources they can provide to students,” DeLaurentis said. “More so, many of our friends said they feel uncomfortable and have even had to lie when they approach Student Health for sexual health resources.”
DeLaurentis further said this is just one part of a H*yas for Choice effort to expand their focus beyond free speech and condom distribution and become a group that provides students with services that the university fails to provide.
Administration has not yet commented on the hundreds of stickers that H*yas for Choice has put up, but DeLaurentis said that some stickers have already been taken down by unknown perpetrators.
Grace said that web traffic on the blog has dramatically increased to five times its normal rate and that student response has been positive.
Emma Konopka (COL ’18) said that it is important for students to understand that H*yas for Choice does more than hand out condoms.
“It’s really about reproductive justice and letting people know that there are these options available to them,” Konopka said. “People don’t really know you can get pregnancy tests at the Women’s Center and have all these different options.”
Another student, Lydia Bubniak (SFS ’18), said that the information provided by H*yas for Choice gives women choices that the university may not.
“The stickers are much better because they give women actual options as to what to do with their life, rather than just ‘you should keep the baby,’” Bubniak said. “How am I supposed to finish school? What am I going to do now? How will I get back into my career?”

Students often mention how Lauinger Library, with its harsh fluorescent lighting and brash cement exterior, is the least inspirational study space. But with the planned opening in March of the Booth Family Center for Special Collections and the November addition of Ethan Henderson, a curator of rare books, that lack of inspiration may change.
Students will soon be able to hold and look through first editions of Thomas More’s “Utopia,” Euclid’s “Elements of Geometry,” John Locke’s “Two Treatises of Government” and Isaac Newton’s “Principia Mathematica.”
Georgetown University’s rare books collection will soon become more accessible to students than ever before, according to Henderson.
Most universities have special collections that are narrow in the kinds of holdings they have, but Georgetown’s collection of over 140,000 rare books defies such trends in higher education. Georgetown’s rare books range in price from $25 to nearly $1 million, according to Henderson. Not only do the books range in price, but they include a variety of topics, including math, Shakespeare, philosophy and the Modernist Age.
“I think [the collection] completely reflects Georgetown’s identity as global,” Henderson said.
The librarians and curators have struggled to make students feel welcome and aware that they have the opportunity to interact with the collection. But Henderson, who was hired by the library in the fall, hopes to change things.
“I am the biggest proponent of anybody, but students in particular, being able to touch and hold the books,” Henderson said. “That’s the whole reason why I got excited about books and people get excited about books.”
Students often feel intimidated when given the opportunity to handle fragile, rare books, a factor that may be contributing to the current low usage of Georgetown’s rare books collection, according Booth Family Center for Special Collections Director John Buchtel.
“There is a real intimidation factor but that is what the curators and librarians are for. We’re here to help and we’re here to help people, to train people on how to handle things and what to look for, how to make use of things in research,” Buchtel said.
For Buchtel, the magic lies in the fact that when students hold some of the rare books in the library’s collection, they are establishing a direct link to authors, holding the same books that some of the world’s greatest minds from Shakespeare to Newton once held. Students cannot check the rare books out of the library, but are able to read the books inside the collection’s reading room.
But students are not the only ones not often utilizing the Booth Center. The number of professors taking advantage of Georgetown’s rare books is smaller than the library would like. In the past five years, 49 faculty members from 17 departments and programs utilized the collection for their classes, according to Buchtel.
Much of the Booth Center’s collection comes from donations and only a small percentage of books have been purchased.
“A lot of [the collection] comes from alumni, people who have gone here or who have had children attend. We’ve gotten some incredible gifts from just parents,” Henderson said.
This opportunity to handle the books is a rare opportunity.
“One of the things that makes a collection really special other than just the items in it is the fact that people can access them and that students can use them. There is a point to preserving books for the sake of preserving them, but we are interested in preserving them for research,” said Jenny Smith, coordinator of Communications, Outreach and Programs.
Emily Morgan (COL ’17) said that she is excited to visit the new Booth Center once it is open in March.
“I haven’t heard of it [the Rare Books Collection] at all, but I would be interested to see what it’s about,” Morgan said. “I think it’d be really cool if professors implemented [The Rare Books collection] in some way.”
Clare Skakel (COL ’17) said that she is excited to see the collection’s access expand after it is opened.
“Well [the collection] is cool, but if nobody uses it then what’s the point?” Skakel asked.
Henderson thinks that the future for libraries will lie in their rare books collections.
“Going forward university libraries are going to look the same because everyone’s going electronic. … What’s going to make the different institutions stand out is their special collections and their holdings. So having a strong holding of rare and unique materials that reflects the institutions and reflects what Georgetown was, is, and — I may sound hokey but — will be.”

Psychology professor Anna Johnson won an Early Career Research Contributions Award from the Society for Research in Child Development this month for her research on the impact of public policy on early childhood development.
The award is presented every two years to emerging scientists and scholars who have published notable research in the field of child development.
A ceremony honoring Johnson and the other four recipients of the award will be held in Philadelphia this March.
The SRCD is a professional society of researchers in childhood developmental psychology with 5,500 members from over 50 countries.
SRCD member and assistant professor in the department of psychology Rebecca Ryan praised Johnson for earning this award.
“This is such a prestigious award, incredibly competitive,” Ryan said. “It’s the highest honor for someone at her professional level in our field.”
Johnson’s research focuses on the intersection of public policy and childhood development. In particular, she studied the impact of the Child Care and Development Fund, a federal program offering childcare subsidies to low-income families, on childhood development.
“I study how public policy affects some areas of childhood development, not childhood development in and of itself,” Johnson said. “I was interested in how this program that affects so many kids actually serves the kids … because it wasn’t designed to help kids. It was designed so that mothers could go to work.”
Since Johnson published her research on the Child Care and Development Fund, her research has been cited in Senate hearings and was considered by policymakers in drafting and passing legislation.
In November 2014, President Obama signed legislation reauthorizing the Child Care and Development Fund for the first time since 1996.
“One of my articles found that the subsidy program gets you OK quality care but maybe not as good as it could,” Johnson said. “So they cited my research and said, ‘Look, we have evidence that subsidies can buy better quality care, but they don’t really go all the way to do as much as they could.’”
Johnson’s research suggested that the subsidy was ineffective given the size of the program.
“Since 2011 I’ve written two articles that say there aren’t really any benefits [of the subsidy] for kids learning, it’s not bad for them, it’s not good for them, it’s just kind of neutral,” Johnson said. “And the fact that it’s a ton of money and a ton of kids, so the fact that it’s neutral is kind of a waste. If we could make it better we should make it better.”
Johnson acknowledged that the political climate of the time is prime for her field of research.
“It’s a good time to be doing what I do because there’s a lot of interest in it right now publically,” Johnson said. “My particular goal is to do high-quality research that policy makers can use to make things better for kids.”
Psychology professor Deborah Phillips, who also studies the developmental impacts of governmental programs on childhood development, explained that Johnson is unique in her field because of her advanced training in both policy issues and developmental science.
“Anna represents a new breed of hybrid scholars who are exquisitely well trained as developmental scientists but also have deep knowledge of contemporary policy issues affecting children,” Phillips said. “Her ability to use the tools of developmental science to inform issues regarding child care and pre-K policy is unparalleled.”
Phillips also mentioned that past recipients of this award have typically continued to conduct breakthrough research throughout their careers to become some of the most prominent scientists in their fields.
“Historically, the young scholars who have won the SRCD dissertation award go on to fill the ranks of the rock stars in the field,” Phillips said. “Those who select the awardees have a track record of recognizing early promise.”

The start date for the H Street-Benning Road NE streetcar has been delayed again due to the safety issues that have been plaguing the streetcar project since it began testing in September.
Former Mayor Vincent Gray intended to have the streetcars fully operational at the end of his mayoral term. When the testing began in September, the D.C. Department of Transportation estimated that the service would begin operation by the end of 2014.
However, the streetcar simulation service was involved in eight collisions throughout the testing process.
The most recent of these incidents involved a minor collision with a motorist on Jan. 7. Though the D.C. Department of Transportation cited the vehicle’s close proximity to the streetcar as the reason for the accident, incidents such as these have raised concerns about the streetcar service’s compliance with federal safety and security requirements. The unwieldy streetcars run only on rails installed in the street, preventing them from changing lanes or stopping quickly in response to traffic.
The project was delayed with a planned opening on Jan.19. However, the streetcar was indefinitely delayed again, with no firm rescheduled date. DDOT did not respond to several requests for comment on the most recent delay.
Construction on the corridor began in 2012, and the city hoped to open the service by summer 2013. In the course of the oft-delayed project, DDOT limited cycling and eliminated parking spaces along the busy H Street corridor.
District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services director of communications Timothy Wilson said that the State Safety Oversight Office, despite the fact that it operates independently within the department, needs to comply with federal safety regulations.
“[The mission of the SSOO] is to ensure compliance with federal safety requirement. … It is their practice to perform a comprehensive examination with regard to safety and security of the streetcar program,” Wilson said.
Wilson added that the streetcar program must be safe in order to fulfill the needs of D.C. passengers.
“The goal to have a light rail system that is suitable for the transportation needs of residents and visitors is within reach. Mayor Bowser has said that D.C. streetcar will open once it is in compliance with all federal safety and security requirements. Until then, testing will continue,” Wilson said.

Georgetown University Associate Professor Jennifer Woolard will work on a three-year pilot program titled Project Cohort, which was created in a partnership between Project Rebirth, Georgetown University, Outward Bound for Veterans and Sierra Club Military Outdoors. The program, which aims to provide veterans with mental healthcare, will launch by the summer of 2015.
Woolard, a professor in Georgetown’s Psychology Department, joined Project Rebirth’s organization after attending a screening of the trailer for the film “Project Rebirth,” which was produced by Georgetown alumnus Jim Whitaker (CAS ’90), who also started the eponymous organization. The documentary explores how the nation recovered after the events of Sept. 11, 2001.
“The Project Rebirth organization was interested in thinking about how the film and related projects could be used to promote resilience for first responders, veterans, and other communities experiencing trauma and disaster. I’m trained as a community psychologist and the idea intrigued me, so I began talking with folks. This began about eight years ago,” Woolard wrote in an email to The Hoya.The pilot program aims to provide veterans with alternative treatment options. Groups will spend time in the outdoors with peers and engage in experiential learning through evidence-based therapies. The program hopes to be the first treatment option for veterans when they return home.
“Project Cohort will produce measurable outcomes regarding the success of our participating veterans in entering and sticking with a mental health care program,” Woolard wrote. “The Project Cohort model is easily replicated and very adaptable and will be shared with [veterans] around the country.”
Although there are currently options for veterans to enter community support groups and job training programs, there is a shortage of options to ensure that veterans are psychologically and emotionally healthy, according to Woolard.
Professor Woolard has done extensive research on post-traumatic shock disorder and the impact of group therapy, and she hopes that Project Cohort will provide a needed change to current group therapy methods.
“Veteran Associations around the country use the group therapy model for veterans in need of care — the Project Cohort program will make the existing model work better for veterans by changing those groups from a collection of strangers into a supportive, emotionally bonded unit of soldiers who have a real commitment to helping each other face life’s challenges,” Woolard wrote.
Project Cohort will be receiving support from several organizations and partners on Georgetown’s campus. Currently, University President John J. DeGioia is a member of the Project Rebirth Board and the Georgetown University Veterans’ Office, and he is eager to work with Professor Woolard’s team.
“The key is figuring is how you combine the strengths of these individual groups with the resources of the national organizations like Department of Veteran Affairs and Georgetown university,” Georgetown Veterans Office Coordinator David Shearman said. “The key is figuring is how you combine the strengths of these. If it can come together, you are going to see really great things start to happen and find new solutions to existing problems. I think it’s very exciting because it’s new and it is being run really well.”
Shearman said that the study was an especially appropriate undertaking for Georgetown since St. Ignatius, the founder of the Jesuits, was himself a wounded veteran.
“It was when [Ignatius] was convalescing and recovering, he found the Society of Jesus,” Shearman said. “Just think about his path and his progression in relation to Georgetown University through Project Cohort and the veterans on campus. I think there are some really strong connections to be made with our identity as a Jesuit university and what we are doing day to day to help student veterans.”
Student veteran Jimmy Sutton (COL ’15), who served for seven years in the U.S. Army, said that he believes the program will have a strong effect on suffering veterans.
“I think that Project Cohort will prove to be very insightful for those studying PTSD and it very closely fits with the Georgetown value of cura personalis,” Sutton wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am glad that Professor Woolard is taking a different approach in studying issues like PTSD [which] are very complex; its effects range from person to person.  Sometimes providers only view PTSD as a mental health illness rather than a deficit of social interaction but the effects can look similar.”
Sutton said that he appreciates the new angle Woolard is taking on the study of PTSD, and he thinks it may lead to new breakthroughs.
“While serving in the Army for seven years, I created some very close relationships and was accustomed to a very strong camaraderie. Since separating from active duty, that same sense of community has been difficult to replicate,” Sutton said. “Studying the effects of social support systems may demystify PTSD, decrease the negative stigma associated with it and lead to better treatment.”

Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., sent an email to members of Georgetown’s Jewish and Muslim communities on Saturday, expressing solidarity with both groups. The email was sent in the wake of the heightened instances of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia that have broken out across Europe since the Charlie Hebdo and kosher grocery store attacks earlier this month.
“The recent tragic events in Paris and elsewhere in Europe have affected us all deeply, in many, many ways,” O’Brien wrote. “On behalf of my colleagues in Campus Ministry, I write to assure you of our support and esteem. We grieve with you for the loss of life. We stand with you in ardently rejecting anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and violence in all forms.”
The email, which was sent to students on the Jewish and Muslim campus ministry Listservs, was received well by student leaders of different faith groups and political groups such as the Muslim Student Association and J Street U, respectively.
“Fr. O’Brien’s email was powerful, beautiful and reassuring,” J Street U Co-President Natalie Magioncalda (COL ’16) wrote in an email. “As a Jewish student at Georgetown, I find the recent events surrounding anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in Europe to be extremely tragic and disheartening. I am appreciative of Fr. O’Brien’s letter; it comforted me, as well as many other students.”
Muslim Student Association President Zahid Syed (COL ’16) said that he feels that the university typically does a good job of fostering interfaith dialogue and creating a community for individuals of all religions.
“I think that Georgetown does an amazing job of bringing together all the different faith leaders and getting them to see that they’re all in the same boat. Georgetown has the infrastructure to support this,” Zahid said.
In his email, O’Brien emphasized the importance of Georgetown remaining a safe place for individuals of all religious identities. He included resources for students to file bias-related incident reports.
“The inter-religious understanding that we foster here at Georgetown offers a footing for all of us to work toward a lasting peace in our world,” O’Brien wrote. “Our friendship across religious differences is the most powerful witness against bigotry and intolerance.”
Magioncalda said that in the midst of heightened levels of hate crimes and discrimination, it is important for different communities to work together.
“During these challenging times, we must continue supporting one another and working together as one student body,” Magioncalda wrote. “As individuals we can either perpetuate injustices or fight to end hatred once and for all, and I have great faith that our students will always choose to speak out against discrimination.”
O’Brien said that he, along with Imam Yahya Hendi and Rabbi Rachel Gartner, are committed to providing support to the Jewish and Muslim communities at Georgetown.
“At a global and religiously diverse university like Georgetown, we appreciate how what happens in the world affects our religious communities here,” O’Brien wrote. “In the wake of the tragic events in France and beyond, we wanted to reach out to our Muslim and Jewish communities in particular to assure them of our support, our shared values, and our commitment to creating a safe and nurturing space for them.”

The Minority Health Initiative Council, a student-led group in the School of Nursing and Health Studies dedicated to minority students pursuing studies in health and minority health issues, celebrated its fifth anniversary last week.
In celebration of the anniversary, the council will be hosting a lecture series titled “Leaders in Health Disparities,” featuring leaders who work to solve minority health issues and eliminate inequalities. The series began in mid-January and will conclude in April, which is Minority Health Month.
The speakers, who were chosen by the council, will include Amerihealth D.C. Market President Karen Dale, Georgetown University National Center for Cultural Competence Director Tamara Goode, AmeriCorps Vista Director Paul Monteiro and Center of Excellence Programs National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Program Director Derrick Tabor.
NHS Assistant Dean and MHIC Advisor Brian Floyd said that the speaker series will address issues related to health disparities in various fields.
“The goal of the speaker series is to provide our students in our various majors with the opportunity to gain fundamental knowledge of the social, political, educational, economic and biologic determinants of health disparities across numerous populations and then provide them with key tools for what they as future leaders working in various health fields can do to address some of these important issues,” Floyd said.
The MHIC has provided resources and support for an increasing number of minority health students since it was founded in 2010.
“MHIC has grown so much in the past five years,” MHIC Co-Chair Aspen McCoy (NHS ’15) said. “After all, MHIC started off as just a gathering of male NHS students of minority backgrounds simply discussing some of their issues with inequities in the health field and in Washington, D.C. [Today,] the MHIC provides a platform for NHS students of minority backgrounds to not only discuss these issues amongst themselves but to discuss these issues with the NHS community and greater D.C. Metropolitan area in general.”
In addition to serving current and prospective minority students in the NHS, the MHIC also partners with other organizations on campus and in D.C. to discuss and publicize issues related to minority health.
“During the academic year, they have also partnered with local campus and community organizations to design and implement initiatives raising awareness and funds for key issues that disproportionately affect minority communities,” Floyd said.
In 2013, the MHIC started “Mission Nutrition: Good Nutrition is Our Mission,” a program that educates adolescents about healthier lifestyles by providing nutrition courses in local public schools.
MHIC member Beemnet Neway (NHS ’16) said that participating in Mission Nutrition was one of the council’s highlights from the past few years.
“Last year I was part of the pilot program which was an after-school program which was designed to teach some of the public school students about nutrition, so I think that its mission is preaching to the community to have discussions on health disparity issues within the minority health community and really helping us to become more aware,” Neway said.
MHIC Co-Chair Khadijah Davis (NHS ’15) said that she was proud of the concepts that MHIC’s initiatives have helped to promote.
“I am proud of the work the council has done and will continue to do to put concepts like equity, pluralism, diversity and cultural competency on the radar of our peers pursuing careers in healthcare,” Davis said.
In light of its fifth anniversary, the MHIC leadership is planning to further expand their initiatives in both the university and the D.C. area.
“In the future, it is my hope that the MHIC will develop a mentorship program for NHS underclassmen, particularly those from disadvantaged or minority backgrounds,” McCoy said. “From my personal experiences and those of some of my classmates who fit this description, it has been expressed that adjusting to the NHS curriculum was not one of their easiest feats to deal with. Therefore, a mentorship of this nature will provide not only guidance but also even tutoring to minority students from minority students.”
Neway said that she would like to see MHIC include students outside of the NHS who are interested in health disparity issues.
“I hope that [we] can get some non-NHS students [to] take part in the council,” Neway said. “It would be cool to see it expand to other parts of Georgetown, whether it’s Georgetown College, [the School of Foreign Service] or [the McDonough School of Business], health disparity is an issue that requires all types of backgrounds and not just health ones directly. I think that it would be really cool to see that collaboration come onto the council.”
Floyd agreed that the experiential learning MHIC provides would benefit all students who are interested in health disparity.
“Research has shown that millennial learners, in particular, report a need to understand how learning will link to their real lives,” Floyd said. “So with such important issues as health disparities and health equity, I cannot think of a better way than this for students to apply what they are learning in the classroom [into] making a difference in someone else’s life.”

The Arts Coalition for the Dupont Underground has begun renovating the abandoned streetcar tunnels under Dupont Circle to create a lively new space to showcase arts in the city.
ACDU Founder Julian Hunt and Communications Consultant Braulio Agnese, who are spearheading the process, began their collaboration in 2010 after the city requested proposals to redevelop the space, which has been abandoned since the city stopped using streetcars in the 1960s.
Hunt came to Washington to set up his own architectural practice in 1996 and was inspired to work on the Dupont Circle project after proposing an ultimately unsuccessful redesign of Connecticut Avenue.
“We began to realize that Dupont Circle was a critical public space for the city but terribly underutilized,” Hunt said. “As an architect and a kind of observer of urban conditions I noticed that there were nine entries that bounded the circle that people thought were ventilation shafts but I gradually discovered led down to an enormous abandoned streetcar station. And that was more or less when I began to explore, study, think about and then put together a proposal.”
The financial crisis halted the project, as the project was, and continues to be, funded entirely through donations and private fundraising. However, the group eventually signed a lease and currently are in the early stages of developing the space.
Hunt said projects like the streetcar tunnel renovation are important to developing the culture of the city.
“Washington, D.C., as a city is a city with an emerging identity of its own — distinct from the federal government,” he said. “What we’re trying to do is create a great public space — a place for people to gather in Dupont Circle and in the institution we are creating under it — that adds to the social fluidity of the city.”
Agnese echoed his partner, adding that the new space could showcase other city artists.
“We hope to showcase things from within D.C., the culture that’s produced here, whether that’s art or design. We’d like to be able to partner — D.C. has a number of great small galleries and other collective groups that might benefit from having 15,000 square feet to play with and create something new,” Agnese said.
Both architects said they believe that the project would appeal to students and hopes neighboring university communities get involved.
“We’d love to be able to tap into the knowledge base here in the city — there’s so many universities,” Agnese said. “There are some projects like this in Europe but real estate works in a different model there. We’re hoping to engage the thinkers of tomorrow. We’d like to get people involved in different ways. If people are interested they can reach out to us and let us know how they’d like to contribute their time and talents.”
Art student Emily Smith (COL ’18) said this new space offers another opportunity to explore the arts and other passions.
“I think that it’s a brilliant way of turning something essentially useless and neglected into a place that’s beautiful and well kept by society,” she said. “Whether or not a person thinks art is useful it’s undeniable that the renewal would make the tunnels better than they are now.”

Rabbi Dr. Abraham Skorka, who co-wrote “Sobre el Cielo y la Tierra” (On Heaven and Earth) with Pope Francis, spoke about Jewish-Catholic relations as well as the need for limits on freedom of speech regarding religion in a discussion. The event was organized by the Office of the President, the Embassy of Argentina and Masorti Olami (also known as The World Council of Conservative/Masorti Synagogues) in Riggs Library Tuesday afternoon.
Skorka accompanied the pontiff as part of the papal entourage in the Middle East in May 2014. Since then the two have been working closely together in an attempt to develop meaningful dialogue between Jews and Catholics.
For Skorka, “real dialogue” involves active planning and commitment to future events as opposed to talk for the sake of talk.
“We approach each other knowing that both of us are very, very committed with the idea of real dialogue, not just tea and sympathy, but the real dialogue,” Skorka said.
Skorka then turned his focus to the role of the Catholic Church under Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust. Skorka said that that some critics say that the Pope had the opportunity to save Jews, but his silence instead permitted the death of more Jews.
Skorka also discussed the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the connection between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, largely due to the role of the media. For Skorka, the media have distorted the meaning of the word Zionism.
“As all of you know, the word Zionism was transformed by the media into a bad word, a bad term. And the image of the Jews in the Diaspora was distorted by the misuse and misinterpretation of the word Zionism,” Skorka said.
Program for Jewish Civilization Director Jacques Berlinerblau moderated the discussion, and said he recognized this shift from anti-Zionism into anti-Semitism.
“I see an equation that we are very familiar with in Washington that anti-Zionism degrades easily into anti-Semitism,” Berlinerblau said.
This shift towards anti-Semitism has had lethal effects, most recently with the recent terrorist attack in Paris, which targeted Jews.
“Nowadays Zionism is a kind of anti-Semitism. Think about what occurred in Paris,” Skorka said.“Okay, the conflict is in the Middle East, it is between Israel and Palestine. Why did they attack a kosher supermarket? They didn’t know exactly if the clients in the supermarket are more Zionist, against the idea of a Jewish state in Israel — they knew nothing. … The only thing they knew is ‘We must attack Jews.’ And the ideology of them is anti-Zionist.”
The question of freedom of speech that has arisen in the context of the Charlie Hebdo attack brought up a debate about the depth of media criticism. Skorka said that today’s media and public fail to evaluate information as critically and deeply as those living a generation ago. Historically, Jewish intellectuals have been strong supporters of freedom of speech.
“Here in the United States, freedom of speech has traditionally been a Jewish issue,” Berlinerblau said. “Some of the greatest defenders of the right of American freedom of speech, especially in the 1960s, were Jewish intellectuals.”
However, Skorka said he supports limited freedom of speech in cases where the speech is meant only to degrade others. Skorka said that this type of speech is only an abuse of the freedom.
Trixia Apiado (SFS ’18), who attended the event, applauded the common ground that Pope Francis and Jewish leaders have been able to reach in their dialogue.
“I’m from the Philippines and I followed Pope Francis’ visit in the Philippines this past week, so it’s nice to see another religious denomination speaking about the same thing,” Apiado said. “It’s just [about] helping the poorest no matter what their identities are and no matter what their religions are.”
