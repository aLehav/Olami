For Pepsi lovers on campus, a brief window of opportunity closed earlier this year when Georgetown renewed its exclusive contract with The Coca-Cola Company, continuing a relationship that goes back to the early 1970s.
Georgetown formalized its relationship with Coca-Cola in the early 1990s, but the company has had a presence on campus since at least 1972, when Vital Vittles opened as a Students of Georgetown Inc. storefront selling just yogurt and Coke, according to The Corp’s website.
Georgetown’s 10-year agreement with Coca-Cola was set to end in June 2013, requiring the formation of a new relationship with a sponsor company. To do this, Georgetown publicized its commercial needs through a Request For Proposal in fall 2012. Various companies bid for the partnership.
“We pulled a group of folks together that represented all different areas of campus to include faculty, staff, students and The Corp to go through a process that could be very collaborative to make sure that we chose the right partner,” Chief Business Officer Deborah Morey said.
After a year of negotiations, Georgetown announced Coca-Cola as the winner of the RFP process in fall 2013, although Communications Officer Maggie Moore stated that there was no lapse in vendor arrangements. This entitles the company to vending and pouring rights for anything on campus that contains a liquid component.
“So if you go to Leo’s, you have the Coke machines, the Freestyle machine downstairs and the fountain machines upstairs and downstairs, so the pouring rights really relates to and ties back to what it is you’re, as you can imagine, pouring,” Associate Vice President of Auxiliary Services Joelle Wiese said.
Pouring rights also apply to bottled beverages, including bottled Coke, bottled Dasani water and Vitamin Water, which are all subsidiaries of Coca-Cola.
PepsiCo’s market success made it a close competitor, according to Morey, but Georgetown ultimately chose Coca-Cola because of its alignment with the university’s mission, she said. By contrast, in August, the City University of New York granted PepsiCo exclusive rights to its 24 campuses, after student protests against Coca-Cola based on allegations of discrimination and human rights abuses.
Sustainability is a key component of the shared mission Morey referenced. Coca-Cola is a proponent of water conservation and recycling, which includes producing bottles from plants, and has established its 2020 Environment Goals.
“The students spoke loud and clear about sustainability on our campus, and want a way to partner with a large organization — a global enterprise like Coke — on sustainability and environmental initiatives,” Morey said. “We have access to folks at a global level to help design our environment and sustainability plan, and to help provide resources as we try to manage sustainability on our campus.”
The new agreement will last for another 10 years. Morey could not provide specific financial data on the partnership because other schools also compete for Coca-Cola’s marketing dollars, but she still emphasized its importance.
“Coca-Cola is probably one of our largest partnerships because of the variety of things they help us resolve,” Morey said. “We have, for our volume and our size of school, a very, very strong relationship, and we’re very, very thrilled to have such a strong partnership. As you can imagine, your leverage many times in these cases is volume, so for us to compete against an Ohio State or a much larger school, where we are able to compete is with our brand — aligning with a name like Georgetown.”
Wiese added that Coca-Cola brings more to Georgetown than strictly financial support.
“It’s not necessarily a dollar value — it’s what they can bring to us to help us,” she said. “They have relationships and they have experiences all over the world that really we are tapping into.”
These relationships include global human development internships and scholarships as well as a seminar series where Coca-Cola company leaders visit campus. In September, Coca-Cola President and Chief Operating Officer Glen Walter discussed sustainability and entrepreneurship with a small group of student leaders.
Additionally, Georgetown held six events in the fall with the support of Coca-Cola and the company’s equipment, including the Happiness Truck and Happiness Machine, which dispensed products such as Georgetown sweatshirts or Verizon Center tickets in Sellinger Lounge, and the Drop Into Dasani College Tour.
“Some of them were just fun, interactive ways for the students to get involved, either if you were going to the games or if you were out walking, and some of them were more geared toward sustainability,” Wiese said.
Wiese works with members of other departments on campus to carry out these projects, including Director of the Office of Sustainability Audrey Stewart, Director of Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr and representatives from the McDonough School of Business. Cohen Derr allocates funding to the six advisory boards under her supervision, which each receive $7,647 directly from the Coca-Cola funding annually.
Coca-Cola also donates products for Georgetown Day or other campus activities outside of this cash funding.
“The Coke funding really helps us with our events. There are several events that we would not be able to do without their support. Besides the funding, sometimes we receive, in kind, donations separately,” Georgetown Program Board Executive Chair Tyler Deloach (COL ’16) said. “Those enhance our programming and make them a little bit more enjoyable.”
The Corp has its own unique relationship with Coca-Cola. Though the company does not receive any of the funding Coca-Cola allocates to student activities, it remains part of the university’s partnership, through efforts like the Corp Coke scholarship, which grants $3,000, usually split between three students. Half of that is funded by Coca-Cola.
“Within the context of the big contract the university has with Coca-Cola, we have a subsection of that,” Corp Chief Operating Officer Rashaad Eshack (SFS ’14) said.
During the 2012 fiscal year, which ran from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012, The Corp posted $5,077,956.24 in total revenue. Of this revenue, 5.6 percent, or $284,222.24, came from sales of Coke products, making the company The Corp’s largest vendor partner.
In addition to a yearly strategy meeting with Coca-Cola representatives, Corp leaders also meet with representatives, including those charged with orders, three times a week.
“When I’m talking to a specific person in Coca-Cola that I know well, we’ll talk about how you connect to your customer base, and what are examples that Coca-Cola does so we can learn from the big corporate environment,” Eshack said. “Because in a lot of ways we’re still learning as an organization, as officers even or as cashiers, so it’s cool to be able to get to know people that are working in one of the largest — if not the largest — organizations in the world.”

The Georgetown University Student Association unanimously passed a resolution Feb. 2 concerning the disruption caused by the ongoing construction of the Healey Family Student Center to New South residents.
The bill, which was introduced and passed in the GUSA Senate, details how the construction is disrupting the lives of the freshman dormitory’s inhabitants and calls for various proposals, including updates on the construction efforts. The proposal also calls for a published schedule of times during which construction will occur, a request to delay the start of construction to after 8 a.m. and potential future compensation for New South residents, including a boost in future housing standing or a pizza party.
“Basically this year, I sent out a poll to New South residents and overwhelmingly, it showed up that this is something that could be tackled, this is something that I could do,” GUSA Senator Tyler Bridge (COL ’17) said. “Really, it was the voice of New South and the voice of my constituents that pushed me to do it.”
For some New South students, the construction has created early morning inconveniences.
“Since I do wake up for my classes pretty late compared to last semester, I do usually end up being woken up by the construction noises at some point,” Nicholas Werner (MSB ’17) said.
To accrue student support for this issue, Bridge gathered 312 paper signatures. After Monday’s bill signing, Bridge created a post on Georgetown Roundtables, the IdeaScale platform. Within two days, the post was ranked 48th and had 158 up votes.
“We just want to show administration that before we go to them, there are enough people who support the proposal. I didn’t want to walk in a room and not have any backing, not have any place to bargain from,” Bridge said.
Bridge expressed that he will be setting up meetings with the administration next week, and that he will work mostly with the Offices of Planning and Facilities Management and Residential Living.
The bill’s focus excludes Village A, which is also located near the construction zone. Chairman Ben Weiss (COL ’15), who represents Village A, described a discrepancy between the effects on the two housing clusters.
“While the construction is in some ways an issue for Village A residents, its not like what it is for New South students, some of whom have construction going on in the wall adjacent to their rooms,” Weiss said. “Unlike freshmen, who are randomly assigned their housing, for the most part Village A students are upperclassmen who knew that there would be construction here this year, and chose to live there this year. One of the main points in Tyler Bridge’s bill is that New South students had no choice but to live in a construction zone.”
While the bill seeks to address some current issues, it also attempts to set a precedent for the future.
“There will be more construction happening here in the future, with the Northeast Triangle dorm and the [Old Jesuit Residence Project]. We just want to make sure that in the future of the construction process, that there’s a council in place, that there are methods in place that would prevent what happened in New South from happening again,” Bridge said.
As for potential compensation for New South residents, Bridge mentioned that an additional housing boost is an option.
“What my constituents want more than anything else, is a boost in the housing selection process. Some have said that that’s unfair. Personally, I have to fight for what the constituents of New South want. We struck that section out of the bill, but I would like to fight for it again with the administration,” Bridge said.
Other ideas include monetary compensation or a pizza party, though those are less viable options.
“There is some idea out there by some that would like to offer a pizza party for the people of New South, for what we’ve lived through and I don’t feel like I need to go back to fifth grade for 25 minutes. While I respect that they’re trying to do something, that’s something that I don’t think we could accept,” Bridge said.
Fellow senators and New South residents alike have praised Bridge’s efforts.
“This is one of those big things where you see a problem and you want to fix it and … Bridge is really going about this the right way,” GUSA Senator Ken Nunnenkamp (MSB ’16) said.
“I think it’s really good that the bill is advocating for students’ voices in a way that I don’t think we’ve achieved with the construction workers. I think it’s going to be more effective than just the emails that they’ve been getting because I don’t think they’ve changed all that much,” New South Resident Assistant Kendyl Clausen (SFS ’16) said. I think that it should hopefully open up the line of communication between students and those who are causing the disturbance.”
Members of the administration continue to work on this issue.
“The Office of Residential Living and other campus partners will continue working with students to address concerns regarding the Healey Family Student Center construction. We recognize the residents of New South are most directly impacted and we remain grateful for their patience,” Assistant Dean for Residential Living Stephanie Lynch wrote in an email.

Georgetown is taking steps to enrich its students’ academic experiences through the introduction of new programs, including small courses for practical skills, a transcript reflecting technical skills and online three-credit summer classes.
The plans embody what the university’s “Designing the Future(s)” Initiative attempts to improve — how students benefit from Georgetown academics through innovation or technology.
“We were doing a really good job teaching people how to do complex things and think critically,” Vice Provost for Education Randy Bass said. “But we weren’t necessarily doing everything we could to provide students the skills to be successful in an internship or in their first job.”
Courses that develop skills such as coding, reading financial balance sheets and using web analytics will, according to current estimates, be available to students by summer 2014.
“A lot of jobs, I think, in science especially these days require coding, but none of our classes really require it,” Priya Misir (COL ’15) said. “I think having more practical classes would actually be really helpful, and make Georgetown students better candidates for certain jobs.”
Accessible at any time through an online portal, the classes will be for either zero or one credit, and will combine content from both Georgetown faculty and outside sources. The university will provide students with access to such sites as lynda.com and codeacademy.com.
“Initially, most of the skills-based things will be for no credit,” Bass said. “If we were to create a one-credit course it would have to have a kind of academic structure and would have to have some kind of facilitator and certification.”
Eamon Johnston (SFS ’17) indicated that the proposed structured guidance would be beneficial.
“Right now, I’m trying to teach myself some basic web design stuff and PhotoShop on these sites Codecademy and Lynda, but it’s really hard to stay involved and motivated because you can think of so many reasons not to do it, whereas if you have a more consistent meeting with a teacher or something you’re more inclined to do it,” Johnston said.
Additionally, education administrators are exploring the possibility of awarding credit for summer internships. Students would participate in a supplemental video course to discuss their experiences with other students on similar internships.
Along with adding small courses and new aspects to the academic calendar, Georgetown administrators are thinking about innovation on a broader scale.
“It’s not just creating additional services for students, but I think we recognize that we’re in a place where we’re really trying to reimagine what the curriculum is,” Bass said. “One of the things that we’re very interested in is also trying to find ways to design and work with creating something like an alternative transcript that would be something like a skills-based transcript.”
Though the alternative transcript remains in the planning stage and would likely follow the inception of the small, practical courses, it would place Georgetown as an innovator among colleges in the goal of enabling students to pursue practical skills necessary for the workplace.
“What is it that students know how to do, not just what did they take,” Bass said.
The university has also created online courses, separate from technical skills that would be implemented this summer through the School of Continuing Studies, like other summer offerings. The classes will be taught by faculty during the cross session period. All undergraduate courses carry a $1,175 rate.
The five classes are “U.S. Political Systems,”“Introduction to Early History: World I”, “Biochemistry and Human Functioning” and “Introduction to Ethics and Writing and Culture”, which will serve as the new form of core requirement Humanities and Writing 101.
More may become available in future summers, but for now the courses aim to help incoming students, both freshmen and transfers, knock out core requirements without requiring that they spend the summer in D.C.
“Alumni, employers, some faculty, some students all seemed to feel as if there was this lack in education that we were providing,” Bass said.

The Georgetown University Student Association Election Commission held the first of two information sessions Monday night, which are designed to inform prospective candidates for the 2014 GUSA executive election about the rules and procedures before the campaign period officially begins Feb. 13.
While all students who wish to run for either president or vice president must attend, only Zach Singer (SFS ’15) and Ben Weiss (COL ’15) were present at the first session.
The second information session is scheduled for this evening.
Both Singer and Weiss have previous experience in GUSA. Singer, who was elected to the senate his freshman fall, served as both speaker and vice speaker of the GUSA senate before assuming the role of chief of staff in GUSAPresident Nate Tisa’s (SFS ’14) administration. Weiss, elected to the senate at-large in his freshman year, is currently the GUSA senator for Village A and was chairman of the senate Committee on Student Life during the past semester.
Neither potential candidate offered a comment to The Hoya, as election protocol stipulates that, as candidates, interaction with the media cannot occur until the official campaign period begins.
Candidates seeking to run for a GUSA executive office must submit official candidacy forms by Feb. 10 and will have two weeks between Feb. 13 and Feb. 27 to campaign, which includes canvassing, distributing flyers and tabling. Campaigning will officially begin at midnight Feb. 13.
On Feb. 12, candidates’ budgets for the ensuing fiscal year are due to the GUSA Election Commission. Budgets must be submitted on time in order for candidates to participate in the presidential and vice presidential debates, which are respectively scheduled for Feb. 23 and a date to be determined between Feb. 18 and 20, respectively. The election is Feb. 27.
During each election cycle, current GUSA executives can offer an endorsement to a particular campaign. Last year, the previous executive members President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) endorsed Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) and Maggie Cleary (COL ’14), who ultimately lost to Tisa and his vice president, Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14).
While Tisa has given no indication that he will endorse any of the teams, his Chief of Staff Singer has been a close ally during Tisa’s term. Last year, Tisa acknowledged the role that Jake Sticka (COL ’13), who managed Appelbaum’s campaign while concurrently serving as Gustafson’s chief of staff, played in the issuance of her endorsement.
Tuesday’s meeting included a presentation by members of the Election Commission, as well as remarks by members of the GUSA Constitutional Council and the Director of Student Programs and Assistant Dean for Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr, who is the administrative adviser to GUSA.
Cohen Derr encouraged potential candidates to retain integrity throughout the campaign season.
“The university administration supports GUSA and works with GUSA in many ways, and also pays attention to what happens during the elections,” Cohen Derr said. “I want to encourage you to approach this process in the spirit to which this high elected office calls you to be.”
Subsequently, the three members of the GUSA Election Commission, Ethan Chess (COL ’14), AudreyAtencio (SFS ’14) and Pavan Rajgopal (SFS ’15) ,gave a short presentation on rules and aspects of electoral procedure, emphasizing the importance of maintaining responsibility for the actions of campaign staff.
“If you lose accountability of your staff, bad things will happen,” Chess said.
Placing flyers on or under doors to students’ dorm rooms was cited as an example of behavior out of line with Election Commission rules.
“You can’t put anything on anyone’s door that they do not consent to; that’s a very serious violation of university policy, as it considers that door as somebody’s own expression space,” Chess said. “We’ve actually come very close in the past to sanctioning people on that.”
The presentation also outlined regulations for campaign budgets, which are limited to $300 per team.
“The reason that spending limit is there is to make the election something that you cannot buy; you have to win it,” Chess said.
Campaign spending encapsulates all expenses, including the printing of paper used for flyers, the development of websites, the utilization of social media advertisements and the purchases that staffers make without the candidates’ knowledge.
Members of the GUSA Constitutional Council Josh Shinbrot(COL ’16), Jason Gerson (COL ’14) and Sarah Rabon(COL ’16) emphasized that the Constitutional Council’s role as a board of appeals during the campaign is to investigate potential breaches of constitutional procedure — not to hear complaints about Election Commission decisions. Before last month’s senate speaker case, the council had lain dormant since 2010.
“Not liking the decision of the election commission is not really grounds for appeal,” Shinbrot said. “We accept petitions only when there’s a legitimate constitutional question.”
Ultimately, Atencio expressed confidence that the current campaign and electoral procedures should make for a drama-free process over the next few weeks.
“The rules are clearly defined, and any big problems that have occurred in the past have been largely from people being not clear on the rules,” Atencio said. “As long as they follow the rules, they’re fine.”

The Corp Philanthropy Committee denied a grant request from the Black Student Alliance last week, upsetting many members of the group and prompting a boycott of Students of Georgetown Inc. locations among some.
“I know me and my 10 people are not going to The Corp,”BSA Vice President Shauntell Pinckney (COL ’15), who is on the planning committee, said. “That’s not going to make a big change, but at least I know I’m not supporting something that doesn’t believe in me, and I don’t believe in it.”
However, other members of the BSA Planning Committee are not participating in the boycott.
“I have friends that work for The Corp, so I don’t necessarily know if it’s The Corp itself or if it’s just that branch of The Corp that deals with the allocation of funds, so I don’t want to react toward the entire organization,”BSA Planning Committee member Khadijah Davis (NHS ’15) said. “I think that if she is offended by the way that she was treated, there’s nothing wrong with boycotting.”
Because of cuts to the BSA’s budget, the organization sought $3,000 from Corp Philanthropy for the group’s April Visions of Excellence Ball, which honors graduating seniors who have contributed to Georgetown through service, academics, arts, leadership or athletics. The Corp denied the grant request on the grounds that the nature of the event was not actively in line with the Corp motto of “students serving students.”
“While the event does celebrate the work of students on campus, the nature of the event itself is not something that the committee felt aligned best with The Corp’s mission of students serving students. Funding for the event was also denied last year for the same reason,” Corp Philanthropy Committee Chair Jessica Lawson (SFS ’14) wrote in an email to Pinckney.
Although the BSA Visions of Excellence Ball celebrates the work of students on the part of the community, according to Lawson, the lack of active service does not qualify it for a grant.
“It’s a celebration of students serving students, which is awesome and amazing, but the event wasn’t the actual students being on the ground, serving students,” Lawson told The Hoya.
She added that the committee usually funds between $250 and $300, a tenth of BSA’s request.
The Corp stated that there were other reasons for the denial of the request, such as the high ticket price for the event and that the funds were going to a formal.
“We also, a lot of times, don’t like to fund events that have ticket prices, especially ones that are high because for us that kind of promotes an ‘in’ and an ‘out.’ Not inclusiveness, exclusiveness,” Lawson said.
This is the third consecutive year the Corp Philanthropy Committee has denied a request for funds for the BSA Visions of Excellence Ball, which is the BSA’s largest community event. The BSA amasses most of the funding through donations.
“It’s the BSA’s biggest annual effort to give back to our membership and other students who are a part of the campus community, regardless of race, religious background, sexual orientation, school. There’s nothing there that suggests that anyone is excluded — it’s people who have given back to the minority student community, and there’s nothing about Georgetown that suggests that minority students aren’t students,” BSA President Erika Nedwell (COL ’14) said. “When they suggest that it doesn’t align with the ‘students serving students,’ it’s not only offensive, but false.”
Although not all BSA members are boycotting The Corp, some BSA members feel The Corp could interact with other organizations more frequently.
“We just wish they would kind of reciprocate that, and we don’t necessarily feel that they’ve done that in the past years, whether it be the people that they hire, the things that they choose to fund, what they show to be their interests; it doesn’t seem to align with the greater campus community. It seems to be very exclusive, which is not only disappointing, but disheartening, because we are students too,” Nedwell said.
Some BSA members also thought The Corp should improve its process of denying grant requests.
“I think the other thing that they need to do is provide feedback because suggesting that whatever the proposal was that something submitted didn’t align with The Corp’s mission statement– I don’t think that’s enough explanation. In what way does that not align with it?” Nedwell said.
Incoming Corp CEO Sam Rodman (MSB ’15) recognized mistakes made in handling the BSA request.
“To be honest, we were a little more curt than we probably could have been in the email. So that final communication and then the way we evaluated it would be the two things that I’d point to that we can improve on in the future,” Rodman said.
The Corp also has plans to change its grant process in order to make it more interactive.
“We would like to find a way to either come up with a more expanded form, work with the people to design their pitches so that they know exactly what we are looking for, bring them in to talk to us or to have some sort of interview process,” Rodman said.
Although this event helped form a clearer plan of how The Corp will reform the grant approval process, the group already had plans to restructure Corp Philanthropy.
“The BSA issue happened to come up at a time when we were still deciding on the best way to make these improvements, so it was crucial in helping us clarify which direction to take philanthropy over the span of this year,”Rodman said.
This fiscal year, The Corp provided funding for Young Leaders in Education About Diversity, Preparing for Excellence, Business Undergraduates Invested in Leadership Development and Relay for Life. In the past, The Corp has not funded formal gatherings.
Pinckney, however, thought misconceptions about the ball could have been a factor in the grant denial.
“The Visions of Excellence Ball, because so many people have an idea that it’s exclusive and only black people are allowed to go, they would only think that we are limiting our people who can come to the event. So they won’t necessarily fund it because they have this mindset that we are closed off from the rest of the community at Georgetown, which isn’t the case at all,” Pinckney said.
The majority of students honored at the ball are black, though two students who were not black were included among award recipients last year.
“Sometimes people need to step out of their comfort zone to actually do something else that is big and different,” Pinckney said.
The denial of the grant request additionally caused BSA members to contemplate the inclusivity of The Corp.
“I don’t think that they feel that they discriminate against the BSA. I just think that whatever their inclusion criteria are, they aren’t necessarily as inclusive as they could be. I think there are a lot of different students who could be represented in The Corp that aren’t necessarily working in Vittles orUG or any of the other Corp business,” Nedwell said.

After “seriously considering” running for Rep. Henry Waxman’s (D-Calif.) seat in Congress, women’s rights advocate and Georgetown alumna Sandra Fluke (LAW ‘12) announced that she would instead run for state Sen. Ted Lieu’s (D-Torrance) seat in the state legislature.
Also a Georgetown alumnus, Lieu (LAW ’94) will vacate his seat in the state Senate to run for Waxman’s seat in California’s 33rd district.
“I am extremely moved by the outpouring of local and national support I have received since I announced that I was considering running for office. My entire career has been devoted to the public interest, whether representing victims of human trafficking or advocating for working families,” Fluke said in a statement Wednesday.
An avid activist for women’s rights and for coverage of contraception in health care, Fluke gained fame in 2012 after radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh called her a “slut” and a “prostitute.” Fluke has since spoken at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, pushing for equal pay for women and coverage of contraceptives in the Affordable Care Act.
Fluke chose to run for a state Senate seat over a seat in Congress because she felt that she could be more effective at the state level.
“I am committed to continuing that fight in Sacramento, working to protect our environment, ensure our access to health care and create the jobs that are desperately needed. While I strongly considered offering my candidacy for Congress, I feel there is a better way for me to advance the causes that are important to our community,” Fluke said in her statement.
Fluke’s colleagues voiced their support for her recent political move.
“I am pleased and delighted to endorse Sandra for the state Senate. Sandra and I have worked together on legislation to advance issues of gender equality and reproductive justice and as vice chair of the Legislative Women’s Caucus, I am proud to offer her my support,” California state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) said in a statement.
Political analyst Christine Pelosi echoed this support.
“I strongly admire Sandra’s public service on a number of issues, and I am so excited for her to step forward and run for state Senate. Sandra Fluke will be an effective voice for her community and her generation,” Pelosi said in a statement.
The California state Senate primary elections will be held June 3 with a general election to follow in November.

For many Georgetown students, an internship at the White House represents the creme de la creme of opportunities in Washington, D.C. One Georgetown student, however, sees a way to make the experience even more enriching: payment.
Following the State of the Union address on Jan. 28, Michael Holper (COL ’14) created a petition pushing for the payment of White House interns on the We the People platform. If the petition, which currently stands at 82 signatures, is able to pool 100,000 signatures within 30 days, the White House is required to issue a formal response.
“In [the State of the Union], President Obama encouraged employers to pay employees a living wage … I appreciate that the president is doing this because it’s a popular issue … but I think it is illegitimate if you’re not actually paying your own employees,” Holper said.
For Holper, who has never served as a White House intern, unpaid internships represent a major barrier to providing equal access to all internships.
“Because it’s such a large time commitment, if you’re not paid, you really have to be fairly wealthy to be able to do this to begin with … It makes it pretty much the purview of only the very wealthiest Americans, so that irks me, too,” Holper said. “Ostensibly, the purpose of these internships is to create good future leaders for America, so if you’re only picking the top one or two percent of income brackets, that’s absurd.”
As interns in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy over the summer and fall 2013 respectively, Timothy Raftis (COL ’14) and Naman Trivedi (SFS ’16) agreed that although a salary would have been an added benefit to their positions, they felt that they gained a different sort of compensation from their time at the White House.
“I feel like the majority would say they gained a whole lot more out of their internship that had nothing to do with money,” Trivedi said. “You keep in contact with people that you worked with, and they’re really well connected in the industries that they worked in prior.”
Trivedi, who often stayed in the office until 8 or 9 p.m. tinkering with projects for fun, posited that the unpaid nature of the position might actually lower barriers for the coveted positions by allowing more students the opportunity to participate.
“I feel like because they don’t pay interns, they’re able to take in a whole lot more than they could otherwise,” Trivedi said. “When you are paid, that limits your pool of applicants a lot more, so I’m not sure that as a sophomore undergraduate, I would have been able to intern at the White House if it had been paid, because they’re more likely to take a bunch of graduate students.”
Raftis acknowledged that having to pay for room and board during the summer for his internship was a burden.
“It was a sacrifice and a struggle to participate in the White House intern program over the summer, as the cost of living in D.C. is high … however, I wouldn’t say that it’s impossible for the majority.”
Although he acknowledged Holper’s argument, Raftis said that compensation for interning at the White House holds more than monetary value.
“I can understand his point of view, especially wanting to hold President Obama to his own standard,” Raftis said. “I think it would have been nice to get paid, however I’d do it all over again in a heartbeat. I definitely worked extremely hard. I worked long hours, especially over the summer when I was working full time, but because I loved what I was doing, it wasn’t a chore to me.”
Raftis added that the unpaid nature of the internship might create a group of interns self-selected for their interest in the position rather than the potential to be compensated.
“Everyone that’s there is completely for public service, and made a sacrifice to work there and not get paid, which has some really great consequences,” Raftis said.
Holper will continue to promote his petition by engaging his friends on Facebook and writing a Buzzfeed community post in the hopes of raising the necessary 100,000 votes by the Feb. 28 deadline.

I’m not sure the main point of Michael Holper was ever addressed by anyone. How is it an equal opportunity program if the nature of the job is such that interns with more prestigious backgrounds and more resources at their disposal have an inherently easier time 1. getting into the intern program and 2. an easier time managing the workload without the strain of also working a side job to pay their bills? Interns in the program that don’t have to work on the side to support themselves outside this non-paid position can perform at a higher quality and rate of work than their side-job-working counterparts. It’s amazing that the second two gentlemen seemingly held jobs down while performing well in the internship program. Now imagine if they didn’t have to worry about paying bills outside of it. Bring everyone back to finish addressing the point Michael Holper made about the entire process favoring the wealthiest, most well connected Americans.

On Jan. 29th, Blackboard Inc. announced plans to enter the online bookstore market, garnering support from students and textbook providers alike, with an aim to integrate course materials into the digital content the platform already provides.
The online bookstore, which will sell new and used textbooks, as well as rental books, e-books and digital content, aims to make the process easier for instructors, who will be able to read peer reviews of selections and view prices before determining which textbooks they will use for their courses. The service will debut at around a dozen schools across the country this spring, before becoming available on a wider scale in the fall.
“We simply thought there was room for something different: A convenient, student-focused option designed specifically to support the educational experience,” Chief Blackboard executive Jay Bhatt said to the Washington Post. “The traditional process for students to buy course materials is not an easy one. We are excited to provide a new content distribution concept that offers a simple, easy and highly personalized experience to the student.”
Entering an already congested market, Blackboard aims to make buying textbooks more convenient by integrating textbook lists with each student’s registered courses. In an attempt to distinguish itself from other online book services, such as Amazon and Chegg, the Blackboard service will automatically create shopping lists for student users based on their current textbook needs.
Although Georgetown currently uses the Blackboard Learn service for the management of courses, the Georgetown University bookstore currently has no relationship with Blackboard, but rather with Follett.
“While we have a relationship with Blackboard for other purposes, like the GOCard, we don’t use Blackboard for the bookstore operations piece. The bookstores here at GU are managed by Follett. Follett provides the current system we use, that Blackboard is competing against.” Vice President of Auxiliary Services Joelle Wiese said.
Janet Uzzell, director of the Georgetown University Bookstore,acknowledged that the store has faced increased competition as students turn to online markets such as Amazon.com.
“Competition is heavier – that’s across all campus stores. Today students are shopping from more than one single source- and that’s a key factor in our efforts to drive affordability and access locally. Programs like Rent-A-Text and the continued growth of digital are key growth areas directly tied to this increased competition,” Uzzell wrote in an email to the Hoya.
MBS Direct, a leading provider of online bookstores, will be partnering with Blackboard to facilitate the service. MBS currently works with over 950 schools across the country to provide online book sales.
Textbook companies touted the move as a good one.
“At Wiley, we are focused on helping students perform better by integrating our content, media and assessments directly into the teaching and learning process,” Senior Vice President of Global Education at John Wiley & Sons Joe Heider said in a press release. “This exciting new development by Blackboard will certainly support our efforts. It is helping create a stronger connection between content accessibility and personalized education, which, in turn, will help improve student outcomes.”
According to the National Association of College Stores, total sales in college stores reached approximately $10.45 billion for the 2011-2012 school year.
In a report titled “Defining the College Store of 2015,” the NACS discussed how, “If frequency is not aggressively addressed, store traffic will taper off by 2015 as student campus visits and ‘book-buying’ trips fall off while online and offline competition ramps up.”
Already, many Georgetown students prefer to purchase their textbooks online rather than at the campus bookstore.
“I would consider using the service for its convenience, but only if it was cheaper than purchasing elsewhere,” John Whitmore (NHS ’16) said. “I often don’t even purchase online, because I usually don’t even need the book. If I do need a book, other students will always sell cheaper than stores.”
One student admitted to going so far as to illegally download his textbooks to avoid the bookstore’s prices.
“I get a lot of my books by downloading them illegally. I use torrent sites such as The Pirate Bay to get most textbooks and a large number of novels and paperbacks. Overall, I probably get at least half of my textbooks from those sites,” the student, who requested anonymity due to the illegal nature of his activities, said.
To retain its student market moving forward, the Georgetown bookstore plans to both expand its digital content while maintaining its commitment to making textbooks accessible to all Georgetown students.
“Through expansion of digital and Rent-a-Text, the campus store continues to add value that other providers don’t provide. Our ability to deliver a curated experience.. affordable loyal service that accepts financial aid and scholarship money that has returns and exchange deadlines that are driven by our campus calendar all right on campus is a huge value,” Uzzell wrote.

With its opening ceremonies Friday evening, the XXII Winter Olympic Games kicked off in Sochi, Russia under a cloud of negative media attention. Yet for all of the seeming deficiencies in the game’s preparation and Russia’s treatment of human rights, Georgetown students and faculty have had mixed reactions to the games, some running contrary to the recent media attention.
Much of the media’s attention has focused on the Putin regime’s discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people under the guise of laws protecting children from sexual propaganda.
“What they can hope for is that the international attention and the influx of people into Russia will help open up Russian society a bit more,” psychology professor and Director of Georgetown’s Conflict Resolution Program Fathali Moghaddam said. “Whenever the spotlight is put on a dictatorship such as Russia … there’s the possibility of change. For example, pressure is placed on Russia to change its human rights practices, particularly with respect to minorities.”
Travis Richardson (COL ’15), however, reported a radically different experience as an out gay man studying abroad in St. Petersburg last semester.
“My experience with Russia is that it isn’t the huge persecuting monster that the Western media likes to play it up to be. Just from my experiences talking with my host family to joining a Russian discussion group, it’s my understanding that Russians aren’t inherently against homosexuality,” Richardson said. Despite calls from LGBTQ activists for the United States and other countries to boycott the games, none chose to do so; though, in a small display of dissatisfaction with Putin’s policies, President Obama recognized three openly gay athletes in the U.S. delegation to the games. Richardson disagreed with this technique, as it curtails the community-building function inherent to the games.
“As far as I’m concerned, the Olympics are a chance to put politics aside and take out any frustrations that countries may have with one another on the field,” Richardson said. “By having our leaders say that they’re not attending due to certain issues — that’s basically saying you don’t find value in the Olympics and the way that it can bring people together.”
Lioudmila Fedorova, professor of Slavic studies, suggested that the influx of foreigners and new ideas into an isolated region could be beneficial across the board.
“I think there is not much education in this area in Russia, and there are some scary stereotypes that people have because Russia is a country of traditional family values … I think that the Sochi Olympics actually are helping [counter these stereotypes] because it is useful for these people to know that in the eyes of others, it’s normal,” Fedorova said. “I think that there was some rhetoric that looked really broad in the eyes of the West, and they [Russians] are trying to comply somehow.”
Moghaddam, however, predicted Russia would not allow much outspoken dissent over the next few weeks.
“The issues of security will be used as an excuse by the Russian regime to persecute dissidents even more, to close up society even more and to gain publicity for their regimes.”
The regime enforced the anti-propaganda laws Friday, when police arrested 14 gay rights activists protesting in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
According to Moghaddam, the increased media attention on the practices of the Russian regime should be beneficial.
“The Olympics being in Russia is positive in the sense that now the spotlight is on Russia, and everybody’s asking questions about the regime there, and that’s very positive,” Moghaddam said.“The regime feels under pressure. And that can only be good.”
Buoyed by viral images of the Sochi Games, Katrina Zheleznyak (COL ’16), a daughter of Russian immigrants, agreed that Russia’s decision to host the games has itself been a stepping stone to creating a more open society.
“On the one hand, there’s that negative part, but then again you see all these different videos online about how the Olympics have always been a little bit gay. And I’m not saying this could’ve happened anywhere else, but I think that this is a really important milestone,” she said.
Richardson, however, did not anticipate the political climate in Russia changing regarding gays as long as the population was being used as the sitting duck for a host of other issues in Russian society.
“I’m not sure if the Olympics are going to change that much about the future of how gays can express themselves in public,” he said. “I feel like the gays in Russia are being used as a scapegoat for other issues Russia is going through, like the negative birth rate for ethnic Russians.”

ALEXANDER BROWN/THE HOYARedistricting could affect assignment of polling places, like Duke Ellington School, seen here on Election Day in November 2012.The D.C. Board of Elections has cancelled proposed changes to realign voting precincts amid worries among local residents that the changes could cause confusion about where to vote in the upcoming April 1 Democratic mayoral primary.
The 59-page “2013 Precinct Boundary Efficiency Plan,” released to the public in October 2013, aimed to fix various issues with the way that Advisory Neighborhood Commission Single Member Districts are defined. The board sought to realign voting precincts with SMDs as well as revise the precinct numbering system to reflect the precincts designated as wards.
Tamara Robinson, public information officer for the D.C. Board of Elections, said that while the board had hoped to implement the changes before April 1, concerns voiced by residents over the confusion the new plan could cause delayed the process.
“We had an original deadline for public input in October. We got some feedback, but we had some more folks that said, ‘You know what? We still have some concerns,’” Robinson said. “That feedback and just not wanting to implement such a huge change in the middle of such an important race were a combination of factors that led us to determine that we would put things on hold for the moment.”
There are currently 296 SMDs in the District and 143 voting precincts. Because many precincts encompass multiple SMDs, voters are often unaware of where they are eligible to vote. Adding to the confusion, voters are sometimes forced to vote at different polling locations for the same election.
Longtime local activist Dorothy Brizill of the government watchdog group D.C. Watch, said the process in developing the plan was mishandled by the board, and that the board should not move forward with any changes until the public has more information.
“The Board of Elections and the staff came up with a redrawing of the boundaries and never consulted with anybody. I go faithfully to every monthly meeting of the Board of Elections — the plan was never discussed, never raised. They never solicited input from anybody,” Brizill said.
Chairman of the D.C. Council Phil Mendelson, up for reelection this year, was quiet on the merits of the proposal, although he emphasized the need for public input in its development.
“Chairman Mendelson has not been involved in this issue. However, he believes that the Board of Elections should be guided by the views of the community,” Mendelson’s Communications Director Karen Sibert wrote in an e-mail to The Hoya.
Brizill also said that, while she understands the argument for the proposed changes, they must be done not only with more public input, but with the understanding of the voters who will be affected.
“The timing was odd. There was no planning, and you’re left to scratch your head and say, ‘Wait a minute, why are we doing it this way?’” Brizill said. “I think there is a case to be made in terms of the confusion at the ballot, but it’s a case to be made to the people that have to vote; you have to have their input.”
Robinson, who acknowledged many of the challenges presented by the proposal, said that the board hopes to revisit the plan in the months between the April primary and the November general election.
“Hopefully we’ll be able to go back and revisit it sometime in May or June. But right now our focus is on getting past April 1,” Robinson said.
Brizill said it makes more sense to redraw precincts during non-election years, when a major race would not overshadow any significant changes to voting practices.
“We have these off years that don’t have an election in them at all, like next year. Why not make the boundary changes effective 2015? We don’t have any elections in 2015. That way any kinks that need to be worked out can be worked out,” Brizill said.
Ultimately, any proposal put forward by the Board of Elections must be approved through subsequent legislation by the D.C. Council, though for Brizill, the dearth of transparency in the process may be a harbinger for future troubles.
“Until the Board of Elections is forthcoming — and by forthcoming I mean have maps that show existing boundaries and what you want to change it to — the process has to stop,” Brizill said.

Georgetown will now require all trademark licensees that source, produce or purchase products in Bangladesh to abide by an international, legally binding agreement to help protect workers, the university announced Thursday.
The Accord on Fire and Building Safety was founded in May 2013 following the collapse of the RanaPlaza factory in April 2013 in Savar and a fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory in November 2012 in Dhaka that led to the deaths of 1,129 and 112 workers, respectively. With more than 5,000 factories, the garment industry employs more than four million individuals — primarily women.
With more than 100 signatories from at least 20 countries to date, the accord has garnered the attention of the international human rights community, according to Georgetown Director of Business Policy and Planning Cal Watson.
“The accord is focused on Bangladesh because the safety crisis within the apparel industry there has been so severe. Two of the deadliest disasters in the history of the global apparel industry happened in Bangladesh in the last two years,” Watson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The accord requires apparel companies to submit to full, public inspections of the working conditions in their factories, ensure that factories undergo the renovations necessary to improve conditions and end business relationships with licensees that refuse to comply, according to a press release issued by the university Thursday. It does not provide for a living wage for factory workers.
The recommendation for the university to sign the Accord, signed by University President John J.DeGioia on Thursday, came from Georgetown’s Licensing Oversight Committee, a group of administrators, faculty and students that makes recommendations to the university regarding its relationship with collegiate products and apparel industry stakeholders.
To date, five other universities have signed on to the accord: New York University, the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, Duke University and Pennsylvania State University.
Licensing Oversight Committee member Julia Hubbell (COL ’15) said the proposal was supported overwhelmingly by the LOC.
“As licensing work goes, the process was actually pretty easy. [The committee] spent some time discussing it — the committee really decided that there were very few reasons that Georgetown wouldn’t. They decided in an overwhelmingly positive way that Georgetown wanted to be part of this great movement for fire safety and general safety in Bangladesh,” Hubbell said.
Thus far, four Georgetown licensees have signed the accord including Knights Apparel, Russell Athletics, Top of the World and Zephyr. According to Hubbell, the university is working with the Collegiate Licensing Company which oversees the university’s licensing contracts to work with licensees that have yet to sign on.
“If there’s a licensee that is found to be in violation or not abiding by the terms of the agreement in the way that it deals with its factories, then that’s grounds for Georgetown to reconsider its relationship,” Hubbell said.
The university first became aware of the accord through its partnership with the Worker Rights Consortium, an independent labor rights monitoring organization founded by administrators and student activists at universities across the United States to protect the rights of workers who produce products sold here.
The accord represents Georgetown’s commitment to caring for the dignity not only of its students, but of those producing any good that carries the Hoya logo, Watson wrote.
“Georgetown accepted the LOC’s recommendation to adopt this new policy because it is committed to protecting the safety and human rights of workers who are engaged in the production of university-licensed apparel. This commitment derives from Georgetown’s Catholic and Jesuit tradition, which respects the dignity of all workers,” Watson wrote.
Licensing Oversight Committee member Nicky Dubois (COL ’16) echoed Watson and Hubbell’s support for the signing of the accord.
“I believe that it is important for Georgetown as an institution to use our influence where we can to work toward a better world. I’m therefore proud of Georgetown for taking this step toward promoting workers’ rights,” DuBois said.
