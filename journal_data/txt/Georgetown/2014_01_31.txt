Five mayoral candidates vying for the Democratic nomination faced off in a public forum at the Sixth & I Synagogue in downtown Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, with candidates challenging incumbent Vincent Gray on his current policies and past legal troubles.
The forum, moderated by Jerry Clark, the political director of D.C. for Democracy, featured D.C. Council members Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) and Vincent Orange (D-At Large), restaurateur AndyShallal and former State Department official Reta Jo Lewis in addition to Gray. Council members Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) and Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), both declared candidates, were not able to attend the forum due to scheduling conflicts.
Candidates touched on issues ranging from education and standardized testing policy to homelessness in the District and tipped minimum wage for restaurant workers.
Wells was quick to distinguish himself from the crowd by criticizing the corruption that he perceives as characterizing several of his opponents’ campaigns, particularly Gray, Evans, Bowser and Orange.
“I’m running to end the culture of corruption in our government. We’ve got three council members that have either stepped down or been indicted, we have a mayor that’s under investigation — an investigation that has cost the city over $40 million already,” Wells said, slamming Gray over the ongoing investigation into his 2010 run for mayor.
Gray was quick to emphasize his accomplishments three years into the job, highlighting economic development and educational improvements as reasons for why voters should grant him a second term.
“We said we were going to bring more fiscal responsibility to the District of Columbia, and we have. We said we were going to improve education, and we have seen improved test scores for our kids and we have the most robust early childhood education program in America,” Gray said.
Throughout the night, candidates challenged Gray on his positions, ranging from his administration’s increase of the budget to the D.C.
education system.
“On this issue, it’s not about the money, it’s about how you spend it. It’s well and good to increase the budget, but where is a comprehensive plan?” Orange said.
One of the more contentious topics was the current education policy in the District — in particular the emphasis on standardized testing as a measure of success, a method introduced during former Chancellor of D.C. Public Schools Michelle Rhee’s time in office.
Lewis honed in on the necessity for a school’s success not only to be measured simply in test scores but also in the environment in the District’s classrooms.
“I believe that tests are just one measure of how well a school is doing, and in this city, it’s great to have fancy, beautiful buildings on the outside, but that’s not what it’s about. It’s about what is going on inside the building, and D.C. deserves a mayor that is going to focus on just that,” Lewis said.
Shallal also harked on the need for revised standards of evaluating the success of D.C. schools.
“Our education system is broken. If D.C. were a state, we would be 51st in the nation in terms of our education system. All parents know that a test is not a good indicator of their child’s potential, and the same goes for our school system,” Shallal said.
In a post-debate interview with The Hoya, Wells was quick to refute the mayor in terms of the inequality he sees in D.C.’s school system.
“The fact remains that there is a huge achievement gap in America and the District when it comes to education. Minority students are still struggling, and it is a social injustice that we allow it to happen. The mayor is simply masking the reality when it comes to education. The achievement gap in this city has gotten worse under Vincent Gray,” Wells said.
In a discussion of tipped minimum wage, Shallal, whose lack of political experience has made him stand out in a race dominated by local politicians, said that he would continue to support increases to the minimum wage as well as changes to how the District compensates tipped workers such as back of the house workers in restaurants, including his own Busboys and Poets.
“I long for the day when we won’t have to have tipped workers, but ultimately, we need to have living wages for everyone. For now, I do support the bill that provides for tipped wages to be 70 percent of the minimum wage. I think that’s a fair compromise at this point,” Shallal said.
Conversely, Orange highlighted his work authoring last year’s D.C. Council Act raising the minimum wage to $11.50 by 2016 and raising awareness of the issues surrounding tipped wage workers.
“I also championed legislation that would provide tipped wage workers up to five days of accrued sick leave,” Orange said, referring to a clause in the 2013 legislation. “We need to understand what the issue really is. Tipped wage workers are entitled to a minimum wage.”
While Mayor Gray holds a double-digit lead his opponents according to a Washington Post poll published last week, his detractors will have plenty of opportunities to make their case over the next two months leading up to the April 1 Democratic primary.

SOFIA LAYANTO FOR THE HOYAThe Smithsonian’s popular dinosaur exhibit will be closed for five yearsFossil fanatics and dinosaur devotees in Washington, D.C., will have to go elsewhere for their prehistoric proclivities when the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History closes its popular “Dinosaur Hall” for a five-year, $48 million makeover in April. 
The renovations, largely funded by a $35 million donation from billionaire and Republican Party donor David Koch, will include the uninstalling and disassembling of the current exhibits for analysis of their current conditions, as well as the introduction of Wankel T. rex to the museum, one of the most complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeletons in the world. The donation will help alleviate the museum’s reduced funds in light of the federal government’s budget cuts last year.
“Limited resources and staff are causing slower turnover of new projects and more outside contracting, our funding for temporary exhibitions has been cut and we are more reliant on grants and private fundraising,” Exhibits Director Siobhan Starrs wrote in an email. “When times are tight, we have to be strategic and creative about where we employ limited resources.”
William Hahn, Georgetown evolutionary processes professor and a former Smithsonian postdoctoral fellow, highlighted the conflict of interest and potential politics behind these funding issues.
“They’ve had a number of instances where the support would come from some corporate concern, and that can sometimes lead to conflict of interest, so you have to be careful about that,” Hahn said. “But also, some of them are very political in nature, so they need to be careful about that.”
The exhibit, a hallmark of the museum since its opening, has not been renovated in over 30 years. The renovation will include an update to the hall’s infrastructure, which has been in place since the museum’s opening in 1910.
“The museum is responsible for the care of the national collections, and many of these specimens require conservation if they are to remain on exhibition without degradation,” Starrs wrote.
Although Koch’s donation will give the museum an opportunity to update and improve the hall, the closure of the popular exhibit also brings its own set of problems.
“Closing a major exhibition hall, particularly one with charismatic specimens like dinosaurs, is never a decision made lightly,” Starrs wrote.
According to Hahn, however, the long-term benefits of renovation will outweigh the “Dinosaur Hall’s” temporary closure.
“The new hall will be at a higher level of quality for education and inspiration for decades,” Hahn said.
In addition, the renovations will help challenge the prevailing view of museums as static, allowing the exhibit to accommodate more recent research findings and to add more technology to the exhibitions. This reinvention, however, comes at the cost of denying a generation of children, young and old alike, the opportunity to experience the “Dinosaur Hall.”
“I think that dinosaurs are the one group of extinct organisms that really give a very vivid physical appeal to the imagination,” Hahn said. “They are large, they are complex and they range from the ferocious to the large and lumbering. They are so different from almost anything you could imagine today that they create this sense of wonder and curiosity.”
Georgetown molecular evolution professor Matthew Hamilton agreed.
“I think that viewing those types of mounted and rearticulated fossils brings that home in a very visceral way for an awful lot of people,” Hamilton said.
Sinead Schenk (COL ’17) expressed concern that the exhibit might lose its appeal for children when it reopens in 2019.
“Well, I’ve seen it multiple times, but I feel bad for the little kids who come to the Smithsonian wanting to see the dinosaurs, but now they won’t be able to for five years and at that point it probably won’t be as interesting to them,” Schenk said.
Students also expressed concern over the preservation of the actual fossils, which need to be cleaned and analyzed after years of exposure while on display.
“I think it’s important to preserve what we have so we can continue to educate future generations,” Sven Beer (MSB ’15) said.

While D.C. is known for its think tanks and consulting firms, a new niche might be making its mark on the D.C. employment scene in the near future: cyber security.
In February 2013, President Obama launched the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative to enhance U.S. counterintelligence, review cybersecurity practices at all levels of government and call for an investment in cyber education for America’s youth. On Thursday, Obama re-emphasized his commitment to cybersecurity with his nomination of Navy Cybersecurity Vice Admiral Michael Rogers to the position of director of the National Security Agency.
While a 2009 study from the Georgetown Center on Education indicates that only approximately 36,500 students or two percent of all college graduates earn a degree directly related to cybersecurity within the computer science field, the cybersecurity industry is worth approximately $60 billion. According to a May 2012 article in The Washington Post, the government will need to hire at least 10,000 cybersecurity experts in the near future to meet demand.
“Technology and security are the key growth areas [in D.C.]. All you have to do is look at what the Dulles Corridor looked like 20 years ago and how it looks today to recognize the immense growth in the commercial technology sector,” cybersecurity entrepreneur and computer science professor Matt Devost said.
According to Devost, the District has the potential to surpass Silicon Valley as the country’s leading cybersecurity center.
“On the security and technology side, you’ll see a dominance within D.C. over Silicon Valley by way of cyber security companies just because you have that talent pool and that broader market – you can sell commercially and to the federal government if you’re located here,” Devost said.
To that end, nearby Maryland and Virginia have gone so far as to attract cybersecurity contractors to their states using tax incentives. In 2013, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley announced over $3 million in tax breaks for cybersecurity companies in his state. Virginia has done similarly, establishing technology centers across the state with tax incentives including in the D.C. suburb of Arlington, Va.
Rather than compete with Silicon Valley, computer science major Kristen Schwabe-Fry (COL ’14) expressed that the U.S. government should use D.C.’s status as a rising technology center to focus exclusively on cybersecurity, a high priority for the government.
“It’s hard to compete with Silicon Valley because it’s already so established. You kind of got to let Silicon Valley do what it’s focusing on and create your own brand in some other way,” Schwabe-Fry said.
As seniors majoring in computer science look for work post-graduation this spring, the burgeoning cybersecurity industry has made D.C. an increasingly viable option.
“In D.C., the government spends a lot of money, and that’s going to be a huge potential market and that’s some advantage for being in D.C.,” computer science major Welles Robinson (COL ’14) said.
Robinson added, however, that Silicon Valley’s steady influx of skill and funding will help it to maintain its high standing.
“Silicon Valley has the money, the talent from Stanford and a lot of talented people flock there. It’s a combination of really smart, really creative and really driven people. And the higher number of people just means a higher likeliness that you’re going to find success,” Robinson said.
Despite D.C.’s promise, Devost did regress that the East Coast city does lack the youth and urban culture of its West Coast counterpart.
“[The companies] aren’t able to offer in the D.C. area yet the culture of a startup that you get with the Googles and the Facebooks. We don’t yet have that hip environment. We endorse a more politically conservative business as a whole where you don’t have that more aggressive kind of startup lifestyle,” Devost said.

The Georgetown Business Improvement District formally launched its 2028 15-year action plan and announced its intention to increase transportation between Georgetown and greater D.C. in a ceremony held at the City Club Tavern Thursday.
The plan was drawn up in collaboration with members of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, the Citizen’s Association of Georgetown, Georgetown University, the Georgetown Business Association, the National Park Service and the D.C. government, as well as over 200 members of the Georgetown community.
“Georgetown 2028: Preserve what is great about Georgetown, improve what’s broken, and create what’s missing, and all within a context of doing no harm and really preserving the great character of the residential community,” Chief Executive Officer of the BID Joe Sternlieb said in his introduction.
Of the 2028 plan’s 75 action items, 23 concerned public space, nine concerned economic development and 43 focused on improving transportation in Georgetown, including improved bus service and bike facilities, potential implementation of a gondola service, as well as the creation of a metro stop in Georgetown proper, an idea that has been discussed since the 1970s.
The BID has received 50 percent of necessary funds from the private sector, but it is still waiting for the District’s Department of Transportation to match the funds so that it can begin the gondola feasibility study. If successful, the gondola aerial lift will carry riders over the Potomac to and from Georgetown and Rosslyn Metro Station.
“I think the transportation initiatives are going to have a huge impact on Georgetown undergrads. We want to make it easier to bike here. We want to make it easier to walk here. We want to make it easier to get to major transit,” Sternlieb said. “I think all of these will have a big impact on Georgetown undergrads,” he said.
The BID aims to have two metro stops in Georgetown on a second, separate Blue Line by 2028 that will run between Rosslyn and central D.C., one near the university and a second near the intersection of M Street and Wisconsin Avenue, to increase the neighborhood’s accessibility to the District.
In another attempt to reduce traffic coming into Georgetown, the 2028 Plan has proposed the construction of a streetcar program near K Street, as well as the creation of more bike-friendly routes. To improve bus service, the plan proposed an extension of bus routes and more frequent service. Additionally, the BID is working with local tech firms to create an app that will give users real-time information on the whereabouts of the Circulator bus.
These various new modes of transportation will all converge on K Street, with the hope of transforming K Street into a vibrant major gateway. Sternlieb stressed the importance of improving Georgetown’s gateways.
“None of them sing the praise of what a great place you’re coming into; all of them need to be improved,” Sternlieb said.
Along with K Street, the BID also hopes to beautify the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, one of Georgetown’s most unique features, according to Sternlieb.
‘The C&O Canal, probably the most unique asset in any retail district, certainly in the mid-Atlantic, maybe in the country, and what can we do to enhance it – make it better, more vibrant, starting a campaign to raise money to build a new canal barge.”
In the next couple of years, Georgetown students can expect to see the improved bus and bike service as well as more retail and restaurants in the next four to five years.
“We’re not going to snap our finger and have all 75 things done in two years, some of them will take all 15 years and beyond, and other things you’ll see up in March,” Sternlieb said.
Georgetown Vice President of Public Affairs Eric Smulson voiced his approval on behalf of the University.
“We whole-heartedly endorse this plan,” Smulson said.

Former visiting professor Emad Shahin, an Egyptian political scientist, has been charged with espionage in conjunction with several other dissidents by the army-controlled Egyptian government, he revealed in a Jan. 23 letter.
Shahin, who specializes in political Islam, currently teaches at the American University in Cairo and has been openly critical of the July military coup that removed the elected president, Muslim Brotherhood politician Mohamed Morsi, from power and instated martial rule.
The charge sheet, on which Shahin is listed as “Defendant 33,” includes espionage, leading an illegal organization, providing a banned organization with information and financial support, calling for the suspension of the constitution, preventing state institutions and authorities from performing their functions, harming national unity and social harmony and causing to change the government by force.
The accusations were filed several weeks ago, but Shahin, who was at Georgetown for Wednesday’s “Egypt and the Struggle for Democracy” conference at the Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, brought them to light in his letter, entitled “Statement to my Students, Family and Friends.”
“I categorically and emphatically deny all the charges, and I challenge the state security prosecutor to present real evidence to substantiate these fabricated charges. I am an academic and have been independent throughout my life. I am an advocate for democracy, the rule of law, human rights and a fervent supporter of the main objectives of the Jan. 25 Revolution in Egypt, namely freedom, dignity and social justice,” Shahin wrote.
Thirteen of Shahin’s Georgetown colleagues drafted a letter to Egyptian Prime Minister Hazem Al-Beblawi, appealing the decision to indict Shahin in the case, which also names charges against Morsi and senior leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood.
“It reflects poorly on the government of Egypt that his constructive and nonpartisan criticism of political events has seemingly led to this attempt to silence him,” the letter, dated Jan. 28, stated.
Rachel Pugh, the university’s director of media relations, declined to comment on the charges.
“It would not be appropriate to comment on the charges,” she wrote in an email.
The letter represents the concerns of individual scholars, not the university
“We’re speaking up because we hope that if a lot of people speak up and point to the absurdity of these charges that the government will reconsider and drop the charges. That’s what you would hope for, but of course there are other less pleasant scenarios,” history professor Judith Tucker said.
Those familiar with Shahin’s work asserted the impossibility of the validity of the charges.
“Professor Shahin was never affiliated with the Brotherhood. He is seen as a threat to the current regime because he is an intellectual voice of reason that has a following abroad, not because he actually committed espionage or treason. That is just ridiculous,” ACMCU Director John Esposito said.
Shahin’s passion for Egypt and its history remains unquestioned by those at Georgetown.
“Emad has always been a proponent for democracy and just government. He left a great job in South Bend, [Ind.,] to work at the American University in Cairo because he believes in the importance of educating future leaders in his country,” Esposito said. “He cares very much about Egypt and the road that the nation is going down in the aftermath of the coup and the revolution.”
Shahin’s scholarship and interest in the future of Egypt remain the primary suspicion for his indictment, as his prescription for a functioning Egypt involves criticisms of the current political situation.
“I have been critical of the course of political events in Egypt since last summer and can only conclude that such criticism — entirely restricted to word and utterly unconnected to any organized group, faction or party — is my true offense,” Shahin wrote. “Like many fellow Egyptians, I am supportive of peaceful mobilization in defense of democracy, freedom, equal rights, and inclusion. I will continue to advocate such values, exercising a right to protest that is enshrined in Egyptian law and, in recent years, deeply engrained in Egyptian practice.”
Shahin would not comment on his case, but spoke to The Hoya at the conference about the general political climate in Egypt.
“There are some voices here and there that are expressing discontent or displeasure, but not to the extent that can mount significant pressure on the military-backed government that can force them to respect human rights and the basic, basic values of democracy,” Shahin said.
Concern for Shahin’s safety is paramount among Georgetown faculty, as it remains unclear if he can return to Egypt safely.
“You worry for these people because these are serious charges, these are charges that could bring serious punishment down on their heads and they’re really just for the purposes of silencing all dissident voices,” Tucker said.
Accusations like the ones leveled at Shahin are rare in the United States, where Shahin holds citizenship, but occur more frequently in Egypt.
“The specificity of Shahin’s case is this is someone who is an American citizen, as well as a well-known academic scholar, but not unique in being persecuted for presenting a balanced analysis of modern Egyptian affairs,” John Voll, a professor of Islamic history and former ACMCU associate director, said.
For some at Georgetown, the charges against Shahin are representative of the situation facing many dissidents and activists in Egypt.
“I think it’s good to try to raise awareness of what’s going on in Egypt, but nothing is really going to change unless the government is pressured. If the [United States] is a player in this whole scenario, they need to take a more active stance condemning what the regime is doing,” history doctoral candidate Katie Davis, who lived in Egypt for six years, said. “But letters and activism just aren’t going to work in a country with this type of political system right now.”
