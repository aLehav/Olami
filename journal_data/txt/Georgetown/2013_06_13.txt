Georgetown has partnered with Say Yes to Education, a national organization that sends public high-school graduates to college for free, the program announced Monday.
The university, along with fellow new Say Yes partners Harvard University, the University of Notre Dame, Northwestern University and Duke University, will provide scholarships to students from Say Yes chapters. Say Yes generally pays any tuition not covered by institution and federal scholarships and loans to public universities, while private universities generally waive remaining tuition for students whose families earn less than $75,000 a year.
Say Yes, which has chapters in Syracuse, Buffalo, Harlem and Hartford, is similar to the Georgetown Scholarship Program. But while GSP mentors students from freshman to senior year, Say Yes begins aiding students in kindergarten.
Dean of Student Financial Services Patricia McWade said Georgetown was eager to join Say Yes in providing scholarships to low-income students.
“It was a no-brainer for us because we already do that with our meeting full need policy,” McWadesaid.
Georgetown will begin to offer scholarships to Say Yes students in next year’s admissions cycle.
