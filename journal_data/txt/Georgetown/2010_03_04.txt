Georgetown University and the World Bank have joined forces to aid Haiti by providing the Haitian government with high-quality satellite and aerial geographical data. The information will allow the government to quickly assess damage and better plan for rebuilding, according to a university press release.
On Jan. 31, the World Bank began sending the data from San Diego to Georgetown’s University Information Systems in Washington via Internet2 networking. The transfer took four days. UIS then transferred the data onto portable disks, which will be flown to Port-Au-Prince.
“The transfer of that much data, first from San Diego to Washington, in such a short period of time is an extraordinary accomplishment,” UIS Associate Vice President Ardoth Hassler said in a press release released March 1. “The before and after high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery is able to give a building-by-building assessment of damage in severely affected regions of Haiti.”
According to the press release, Georgetown was chosen to help transfer the data due to its Jesuit tradition of service.
“When approached with the inquiry to assist with the data transfer, I learned it was because of Georgetown’s well-known institutional commitment to service,” Hassler said in the press release.
Stuart Gill, of the World Bank’s Disaster Risk Management Office for Latin America and the Caribbean, indicated that the university helped provide a tremendous service to the Haitian government that would significantly benefit recovery efforts.
“Through their efforts we were able to provide critical information to the Haitian government and relief organizations on the ground that will assist in rebuilding this country after such a devastating loss,” said Gill in the press release.

The Fire This Time, Georgetown University’s students of color news magazine, returned to newsstands on Tuesday after a lengthy hiatus – its team reminded of its mission and ready with a plan for success.
Short-staffed, editors of The Fire This Time decided last term they needed to overhaul the publication and coordinated with the university to offer a course titled “The Fire This Time Workshop,” taught by former Washington Post contributor Athelia Knight of the English department.
“[Knight has] helped a lot in terms of letting us know what we need to do to make a successful paper,” Managing Editor Alexandra Bledsoe (SFS ’12) said. “We meet and discuss story ideas . it’s a working newsroom.”
Some believe that the course, which currently meets twice a week, will allow the publication to overcome some of the challenges it has encountered in the past.
“I think it is going to breathe life into a publication that was definitely having some issues,” former Editor-in-Chief Yamiche Alcindor (COL ’09) said. “It will show people . how important it is to have a different point of view in the media.”
Alcindor spoke of the dependability of the publication’s new setup.
“Last year, production was more difficult because we had a really small staff. Now, with a full board and consistent contributors from the class, it has been easy to count on consistency in terms of production.”
According to Bledsoe, the publication will release two more issues this semester. It is still uncertain whether the course will be offered in the future.
“It will still be a student organization, but not necessarily still a class. That’s why one part of our class that is really important is teaching everyone how to do every part of the paper so that if we don’t have this class again, we can do it ourselves,” Bledsoe said.
Alcindor, who initially joined the publication in fall 2005, cited funding and leadership problems in the past.
“Every year the editor had to come up with creative ways to publish the paper . the heart of the paper was there but the structure wasn’t,” she said. “Then we came under the university and people didn’t understand what that meant. Then we had the resources, but not the people.
The Fire This Time was founded in spring 2000 following hate crimes motivated by race on campus.”

Rain or shine, GU Pride members knew they had reason to celebrate early Wednesday morning.
As many same-sex couples prepared to line up at D.C. Superior Court, Georgetown students like J.C. Hodges (SFS ’11) were fresh off of a late-night baking spree to commemorate the first day of same-sex marriage licensing in the District.
Roughly 500 cupcakes later, GU Pride set up shop in the main lobby of the Leavey Center – a drizzling rain and low temperatures in Red Square forced a switch in location – to hand out free cupcakes and fliers to the university community.
“It’s the first day gay marriage is legal in the District, so we’re celebrating,” Hodges, one of about eight GU Pride members who stayed up until 4 a.m. to make the cupcakes, said to students as they stopped by for the baked goods.
The fliers Hodges and others handed out listed the 1,038 marriage benefits for which D.C. gay and lesbian couples were previously ineligible.
Passersby partaking in the celebration also demonstrated their support by writing their names on a strip of construction paper used to create a multicolored paper chain now hanging in the LGBTQ Resource Center, according to Mia Di Stefano (COL ’12), a member of GU Pride.
According to The Washington Post, 151 couples applied for marriage licenses on Wednesday.
“Marriage inequality is a civil rights, political, social, moral and religious issue in this country and in many nations, and as I sign this act into law, the District from this day forward will set the tone for other jurisdictions to follow in creating an open and inclusive city,” Mayor Adrian Fenty said in a press release on his Web site.
Councilmember David Catania (I-At-Large)(SFS ’90, LAW ’93) proposed the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Equality Amendment Act of 2009 on Oct. 6, 2009. Fenty signed the bill on Dec. 18, 2009, and a requisite 30-day period of congressional review ended Tuesday evening.
“[Wednesday] was the culmination of a year of attentive work on this issue,” Catania’s Chief of Staff Ben Young said. “It’s not over by any means – we have to be vigilant, and we have to make sure our law stays on the books, but there was a sense of `We did it, finally,'” Young said.
any same-sex couples waited in line for hours on Wednesday, with some arriving as early as 6 a.m. in anticipation of D.C. Superior Court’s 7 a.m. opening time.
Representatives of Catania’s office took a similar approach to GU Pride’s, handing out chocolate and vanilla cupcakes from Dupont Circle’s Hello Cupcake to the first 200 newly licensed couples starting at 8:30 a.m. Catania appeared to distribute cupcakes from 10:30 am to 11:30 am, according to Catania’s Web site.
The bill’s passage also pleased other members of the Georgetown community.
“[Councilmember] David Catania, the chief architect of the bill, is our alum, and he was the keynote speaker last year on campus at Lavender Graduation [LGBTQ’s annual graduation ceremony],” Sivagami Subbaraman, director of the LGBTQ Center, said. “It is great that D.C. has taken this step forward, and that so many of the difficulties and divisions in that process have been resolved.”
The challenges Subbaraman referred to included months of opposition by the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., and other religious groups. During the review period, many opposition groups lobbied for a city-wide referendum on the bill, a measure that was rejected by the D.C. Superior Court and the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics multiple times.
Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Washington decided to adjust its policies on employee health care benefits on Tuesday in protest of the new law. Under the new policy, health care benefits are not extended to spouses of both hetero- and homosexual employees.
“Catholic Charities changed its employee benefit plan to comply with the D.C. same-sex marriage law. We continue to honor health care coverage of all employees but as of today, new and current employees will not be able to add spouses to the health care plan,” Edward Orzechowski, president and chief executive officer of Catholic Charities, said to the Washington Times.
Former Chief Operating Officer of Catholic Charities Tim Sawina protested the group’s decision in a letter sent Wednesday, saying spousal benefits would drive away current and future employees and would cause Catholic Charities to lose respect in the community, according to the Post. Under the new law, Catholic priests do not have to perform same-sex marriages if they do not wish.”

**Update:** This article was updated at 4:28 p.m. on March 4.
The Student Activities Commission voted Monday in favor of funding an abortion rights event to be held by Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justics, a coalition recently formed by United Feminists and H*yas for Choice.
The event is set to feature three male panelists in favor of abortion rights speaking on the role of men in the abortion rights movement. The motion to fund the event passed after SAC Chair Ethel Amponsah (NHS ’11) voted in favor, breaking a 4-4 tie with 2 abstentions. $175 was allocated to United Feminists, which is university-funded, for the event.
Discussion arose at the meeting among SAC commissioners and Bill McCoy, associate director for student programs, over whether approval of the funding request would conflict with the university’s Jesuit identity.
“This is a forum for dialogue. By attending the event, you’re not stripped of your Catholic identity,” SAC Commissioner Senyo Abotsi (COL ’11) said at the meeting.
SAC Commissioner Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13) said the event would be about education, not promotion of a particular stance on abortion.
“Looking at the specific event though, the main purpose is education about men’s roles in this movement, not necessarily to advocate a position,” Stirrett said.
A representative for United Feminists at the meeting said, “Our mission is to promote dialogue about [equality for women and of health services for women], not limit ourselves to one point of view.”
Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Choice was denied a request for university support in a Feb. 24 letter from Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson.
“Through its speech and expression policy, the university provides students the opportunity to participate in a dialogue on a wide range of issues,” Olson wrote. “As a Catholic and Jesuit institution, however, Georgetown cannot support organizations whose stated purpose conflicts with Catholic moral teaching.”
There has been no official university statement released in reaction to the event approved by SAC on Wednesday. In the past, the university has not sponsored groups or events on campus affiliated with the abortion rights movement, such as H*yas for Choice, United Feminists’ Plan A coalition partner.
In a recent interview, H*yas for Choice Vice President Erica Slates (SFS ’10) said Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justice was working to plan events for the remainder of the semester.
Steve Ryckbosch (COL ’11), president of the Georgetown chapter of the Knights of Columbus, expressed concern at SAC’s decision to fund the panel discussion.
“I don’t think the university or anyone related to the university should fund an event like that. . The pro-choice movement is counter to what the university supports. It goes against the university because the Catholic belief [in pro-life] is so strong,” Ryckbosch said.
Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Choice, has drafted an online petition of the university’s lack of sponsorship that currently has 182 signatures.
The group plans to hold a “speak-out” in Red Square Thursday afternoon to inform members of the university community of its goals as an organization, to offer personal testimony of members and to deliver a letter to University President John G. DeGioia, according to a Facebook event created by Plan A.
According to the group’s Web site, “Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justice is a coalition of students dedicated to changing the way that Georgetown University approaches issues of reproductive justice and choice.”
The group cites flaws in the university’s policy on reproductive issues such as the lack of contraception sales on campus, the unavailability of rape kits at Georgetown University Hospital, the lack of comprehensive on-campus sex education and the administration’s unwillingness to offer financial support to student groups in favor of abortion rights.
“United Feminists and [H*yas for Choice] are operating as a unified coalition in solidarity with each other,” Marion Cory (COL ’10) of United Feminists said. “Although we are coming from two distinct groups, we are one coalition of students committed to engaging in this cause together.”

Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.), the youngest member of Congress and voted “hottest freshman” by readers of The Huffington Post, spoke to students Wednesday evening in the Intercultural Center about his fast track to Congress, his experience as a first-time senator and his views on the current state of the Republican Party.
Schock, 28, explained what motivated him to enter politics in 2001, when he was a 19-year-old elected to the school board of Peoria, Ill.
“I really got involved in politics not because anyone was pushing me that direction, but simply because I saw a need on my local school board and thought, `I’m going to step up and I can do a good job and I have something to offer,'” Schock said.
After becoming the youngest school board president in history at 23, according to his Web site, Schock decided to run for the Illinois House of Representatives. In 2004, he defeated the 8-year incumbent, Democrat Ricca Slone, by 235 votes.
Since his election to the House of Representatives in 2008, he has been appointed to deputy minority whip and has been given three committee assignments, more than most congressional newcomers usually receive.
“The fact that he is only a few years older than most of our members makes his appeal to our group even stronger,” Geoffrey Bible (SFS ’12), chairman of the Georgetown University College Republicans, said.
Schock said that although many questioned his qualifications at first because of his age, he believes that age diversity among congressmen is crucial.
“People of our generation have a different view on life, and while I would suggest that not everybody in the [U.S.] Congress ought to be our age, if you took a look at the [Congress], which I’m sure you have, you know that most of [Congress] doesn’t look like anything like you or I,” he said. “And when you get too much of one thing, you get skewed government.”
After describing his path to Congress, Schock fielded questions regarding his views on the government as a whole and on the Republican Party’s present and future.
“I actually think one of the reasons why we have a great shot at winning the majority is because the issues of the day are economic concerns,” he said. “That is an issue our party owns, I believe, and it is also an issue that unites our party.”
Reflecting on Schock’s speech, Bible provided some political commentary.
“I think the point that resonated for me was that we need to be a big-tent party. We can’t expect a Republican from the West to be the same as one from the Northeast and one from the Midwest,” Bible said.
As Schock discussed the problems facing government today and his proposed solutions, however, not everyone in the audience agreed with his politics.
In response to a comment Schock made on the high deficit accumulated during President Obama’s term, Isabel Baker (SFS ’13) said, “The deficit would have gone up no matter who the president was because we’re going through one of the worst financial crises in history.”
“He was looking at a partial truth rather than a whole truth,” she said later. “His numbers were correct figures but they mean nothing without the context in which they actually exist.”

Robert Clarke, interim director of the Biomedical Graduate Research Organization of the Georgetown University Medical Center, along with five other researchers, published the results of a new study on breast cancer treatment in a February article featured in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal.
Clarke also serves as co-director of the Breast Cancer Program at the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, which is a part of both the Medical Center and Georgetown University Hospital.
According to a Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center press release, the research shows that combining tamoxifen, the world’s most prescribed breast cancer treatment option, with a derivative of the feverfew plant – a common medicinal herb – may be useful in preventing resistance to the tamoxifen.
The 16-page report indicates that 70 percent of newly diagnosed breast cancers are estrogen receptor positive breast cancers, despite the fact that anti-estrogen therapy has been the leading breast cancer treatment for over 30 years. Fifty percent of these cases either do not respond to or are resistant to tamoxifen, making resistance to the drug of critical importance.
“Although tamoxifen reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer, not everyone is cured, obviously. The problem is that some tumors respond well and that some don’t. Some might initially start being affected by the treatment and then reverse, so this is [what is] currently being looked at,” Clarke said in a phone interview.
Clarke and other members of the research team have been conducting research on the subject for years. With publication of the results, testing can begin soon.
“For this particular study, we next want to see if it will work with animal models and then continue work with an exploratory trial to see if could be used against humans. The animals study could probably begin fairly soon, but the humans studies always take a while before they can begin,” Clarke said.
Parthenolide, the chemical tested in combination with tamoxifen, is a derivative of the feverfew plant currently being studied as a possible treatment for various forms of leukemia. Clarke explained that the feverfew herb itself has been used as a natural medicine for migraines and arthritis. Tamoxifen was first introduced as a treatment for breast cancer by renowned breast cancer scientist V. Craig Jordan, who currently serves as the scientific director of the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.
The study was funded by grants from the U.S. Department of Defense, the Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, and the National Institutes of Health.”

As Georgetown students begin to embark on trips along the Northeast Corridor for spring break, those opting to travel on Amtrak’s Acela Express have a new user-friendly feature at their disposal: Wi-Fi Internet service on their laptops.
Amtrak installed the service, known as AmtrakConnect, on all 20 of its high-speed Acela trains, as well as in six major stations in the Northeast and in ClubAcela lounges, according to a March 1 Amtrak press release.
Wi-Fi will be offered to all Amtrak passengers at stations in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, Providence and Westwood, Mass.
According to Karina Romero, a media relations representative for Amtrak, the company has no plans to expand Wi-Fi services to all Amtrak trains.
“Customer demand was the driving force in our introduction of Wi-Fi on the Acelas. Amtrak is evaluating opportunities to implement AmtrakConnect on other trains, but has no firm plans to do so in the near future,” Romero said.
The service is free to all customers during its debut, though according to the press release, Amtrak officials indicated they will discuss an official policy based on customer usage and system effectiveness at a later point in time.
The speed of Internet will vary, according to Romero.
“With any cellular-based technology, various factors can affect network speed, including the number of passengers who are online and overall demand on cell towers by the general public,” she said.
“Additionally, performance of the network will vary as the train travels along the route as determined by the availability of cell towers and strength of an individual cellular carrier’s signal.”
The wireless service does not premiere without any limitations. For instance, Amtrak may prohibit access to certain Web sites and may prevent video streaming.
“Passengers should be asked to refrain from playing streaming video or downloading large files and to use headsets when audio is involved,” Romero said. “Amtrak may restrict access to some Web sites or restrict individual customers from using high levels of bandwidth.”
Student responses to the recent installation of the Wi-Fi service were varied. Molly Gelsey (COL ’10), who said she usually rides the Acela home to New Jersey, said, “It’s a good thing, it’ll be nice to be able to use the internet while travelling.”
Tim Smith (COL ’11), an Amtrak customer, said he thinks Wi-Fi on trains is unnecessary.
“[Internet on trains is] nice, but unnecessary. People are now over-reliant on their BlackBerrys and laptops. Actual human interaction seems to be becoming less and less important in the technological age.”
Wi-Fi service is currently offered on the BoltBuses of Greyhound and Peter Pan as well as on all domestic flights by Delta Airlines. However, the BoltBuses charge a fee based on the number of passengers signing up for Wi-Fi, while Delta offers free Wi-Fi access.”
