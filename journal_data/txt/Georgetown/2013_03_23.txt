Blog author Yoani Sánchez and freelance writer Orlando Pardo emphasized the importance of social media in the fight for self-expression in Cuba Wednesday evening.
According to Pardo, he and Sánchez began blogging in order to promote self-expression rather than because of political motivations.
“We just share views and we get together to create and deliver voices in an independent forums, but we’re not advocating any policy or ideological platform,” Pardo said.
Nevertheless, Pardo and Sánchez’s online activity has attracted a large amount of political interest. Both have faced arrest and questioning in Cuba, but Pardo said that the risk was necessary to the fulfillment of their ultimate goals.
“In the middle of stigmatization and repression, we are agents of provocation united under a mission of creating a more inclusive society,” Pardo said.
Sánchez agreed and said that the sacrifice was worth the result.
“There’s something changing in Cuba,” Sánchez said. “Now, we can tell the world what’s going on for the first time.”
In her speech, Sánchez stressed the evolution of social media’s role in Cuba. Sánchez, who began her journalism career in 1994 when she built her own computer to work on literary magazine Lettra Lettra, spoke about the difficulty accessing the Internet in Cuba. Sánchez added that this difficulty often leads to a feeling of isolation.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba experienced a severe economic downturn. Coupled with the Cuban government’s infrastructural weaknesses, the country’s economic problems resulted in the Cuban people’s near-total inability to access international news.
According to Sánchez, however, a new generation is using social media to reopen these lines of communication. Sánchez cited the intertwining of the virtual and real worlds as the main reason for this phenomenon.
“Sometimes, we think that the virtual world is just some distant space of kilobytes totally disconnected from our lives, but that’s not true anymore,” Sánchez said.
As an example, Sánchez cited her 2012 arrest.
“Had it not been for the emergence and increased usage of social media in Cuba, I would not have been released so quickly,” Sánchez said. “That wouldn’t have been possible before; people would have to stay in prison for years and years.”
To Sánchez, this was proof of progress in the fight for self-expression.
“Now, I teach other Cubans how to work with these new social media platforms, and I always tell them this: tell your own story,” Sánchez said. “You now have the power of the first-person.”
Overall, Sánchez stressed the importance of self-expression.
“Cuba deserves self-expression for Generation Y, and everyone deserves a voice,” Sánchez said.
Irini Pitta (SFS ’15) said that she was inspired by Sánchez’s unwillingness to be silenced.
“As a member of a younger generation, it’s refreshing to see someone so dedicated to giving the youth a voice and also acting as a role model for doing so,” Pitta said.
Multilingual students also said that they appreciated that Sánchez spoke in her native language.
“The fact that she spoke exclusively in Spanish definitely added to the cultural authenticity of the presentation and drew together such a wide range of cultural communities under a common language,” Hayden Freedman (COL ’15) said.

UNICEF Georgetown took a break from its regular fundraising and discussion last week to educate Georgetown about water, sanitation and hygiene needs around the world during World Water Week.
UNICEF Georgetown promoted and fundraised for UNICEF’s Tap Project, a campaign to provide clean water to children in developing countries in honor of World Water Day today.
This is the first time UNICEF Georgetown has devoted an entire week to the campaign, which has raised approximately $200.
“Last year, this wasn’t that big a deal, so we’re trying to expand our presence,” UNICEF Georgetown member Antara Joardar (SFS ’16) said.
UNICEF Georgetown President Dawn Chan (SFS ’14) said that World Water Week is particularly compatible with the group’s goals.
“Our main purpose here is to educate, advocate and fundraise,” Chan said. “World Water Week really fits into what we believe in and our function as a campus organization.”
In the biggest event of the week, UNICEF Georgetown held a spotlight dinner on clean water in Haiti Tuesday night. The dinner featured Andrew Bell, a research fellow at the Environment and Production Technology Division of the International Food Policy Research Institute, and Zachary Brehmer, director of research of International Action, an organization that brings clean water to communities in Haiti. Bell works on irrigation and sustainable land management in Asia and Africa.
Chan said the speakers were selected to provide two different perspectives on water issues.
“[Brehmer] talked about [International Action’s] work in Haiti and their ground operations, giving students a perspective on how water works on the ground,” she said. “Dr. Bell talked about, on a policy level, how you can change things to improve the provision of clean water. [He talked] about water rights and things we wouldn’t have thought about on a daily perspective.”
Chan was satisfied with Tuesday’s dinner.
“We got a really good turnout in our spotlight dinner,” she said. “We got a lot of questions and a lot of people stayed to talk to our speakers.”
Special Events Coordinator Brian Goggin (SFS ’14) described UNICEF Georgetown’s appeal to students.
“Georgetown is a community that’s very interested in development in general,” he said. “We have a lot of students who are interested in the topic, … but sometimes it’s also good to be passionate about something and put those ideas into action, rather than just scholarship.”
The group also sponsored a raffle and sold cupcakes to raise money for the Tap Project, in addition to holding a trivia night in Hoya Snaxa.
World Water Day is also acknowledged by professors, especially at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, which is featuring academic discussion of international water issues through its website and social media Friday.
“Water may also be the most fundamental of human rights because without water nothing else can succeed, including life itself,” Berkley Center senior fellow Katherine Marshall wrote in an email. “World Water Day marks the universal quality of the challenge, as it sets out to make sure that all the world’s people have access to clean water, not someday, but now. At the Berkley Center, we’ve taken up an important and neglected dimension of this challenge: the actual and potential links ways in which the deep faith concern for water can translate into practical, tangible results.”
UNICEF Georgetown Treasurer Janine Duffy (SFS ’14) agreed that clean water issues need more attention.
“I think it’s something that most people should think about,” Duffy said. “It’s the leading cause of death for children in the world, and we just take it for granted.”

Georgia State University assistant professor of history Marni Davis addressed misconceptions about the complex relationship between Jewish identity and American prohibitionist values Wednesday afternoon.
The lecture, sponsored by the Program for Jewish Civilization and the American Studies Program, stemmed from Davis’ 2012 book “Jews and Booze: Becoming American in the Age of Prohibition.”
Davis began her research after she learned that many saloons in the early 20th-century American South were owned and run by Jews.
“People often don’t associate Jews with alcohol, maybe because of preconceptions … that Jews don’t really drink very much,” Davis said.
Still, she said, Jews held a large claim in the alcohol production industry — especially for whiskey. According to Davis, before Prohibition, Jews made up as much as a quarter of the whiskey production industry in “whiskey hubs” like Cincinnati, Ohio, and Louisville, Ky.
“They weren’t in the majority … of a municipal or state whiskey industry, but in some places they were a very, very visible and active minority,” she said.
Davis cited the use of alcohol in Jewish religious services and its history of cultural consumption among Jewish immigrants, particularly those from Eastern Europe, as reasons for this unexpected participation in alcohol commerce.
“It’s fair to say that it was a combination of Jewish culture, Jewish economic experience and to some degree Jewish religious practices,” Davis said. “The culture that Jews brought with them from Europe to the United States but also the … structures and the ways that the economy [was in] the United States at that moment when Jews arrived [that] made alcohol a very attractive trade.”
According to Davis, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, alcohol was the fifth largest industry in the United States and was responsible for a third of the federal revenue.
By 1873, however, women grew upset with the prevalence of alcohol, as it led to frequent domestic violence, and started what Davis called the “women’s crusade” that led to Prohibition in the 18th Amendment in 1920.
“There is an element of women’s rights within it,” she said. “At the same time, this was unquestionably a Protestant religious movement, one that regarded alcohol as a sinful substance.”
Thus, Davis said, the clash between Jews and the prohibitionists began with this fundamental difference in ideology. Additionally, prohibitionists tended to dislike immigrants — many of whom were Jews — for their cultural drinking habits.
“Generally speaking, efforts to ban alcohol were part of a broader effort to align American political and cultural practices with very specifically Anglo-American and Protestant theology and morality,” Davis said. “Under those circumstances, we shouldn’t be too surprised that American Jews were opposed to the Prohibition movement.”
In addition to the role alcohol played in Jewish-American culture, many Jews also believed that Prohibition violated their constitutional rights.
“American Jews … defended the right to drink, and they defended the right to participate in alcohol commerce, in accordance with the rights of conscience and the rights of religion and the rights of property that were guaranteed by the constitution,” Davis said.
Additionally, many Jews took offense to the notion that alcohol had to lead to violence. Instead, Davis said, they stressed moderation and therefore did not believe it needed to be outlawed.
Davis also discussed the factor of race-relations in the Jewish-American alcohol trade. In the American South especially, she said, Jewish-owned saloons often served black customers, despite Jim Crow laws banning blacks from these establishments.
“There was some fear that Jews were indifferent — insufficiently invested in Jim Crow custom,” Davis said. “So the fact that Jews would sell alcohol to black men was seen as transgressive behavior, and it heightened Southern skepticism about their capacity to assimilate.”
Ultimately, a race riot in Atlanta, Ga., where many of these saloons were located, led to increased support of Prohibition and the passing of the 18th Amendment. Despite the fact that Jews were largely against Prohibition, however, many Jews, including Isidor Einstein, ended up working as Prohibition agents.
“It’s ironic … that one of the most famous Jewish celebrities of the Prohibition era was in fact an enforcer of Prohibition law,” Davis said. “It should remind us that generalizations about Jewish behavior, or about Jewish attitudes toward alcohol or Prohibition, are only so helpful — in fact they had no single response to the Prohibition movement, and no absolute relationship to alcohol.”
Davis’ talk mostly attracted graduate students and community members, including Judd King (GRD ’13).
“My dad’s side of the family is Jewish and I know from our own family stories that they had some very interesting relationships with alcohol themselves,” he said. “It’s a topic that’s of interest to me to see how they reacted to that, just because I know it’s something that has a lot to do with the way people constructed their identity within this really major debate that was going on at the time.”

Edmund Burke III, a research professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz, analyzed the significance of the Mediterranean’s geographic location in the development of the region during the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies’ 2013 Annual Symposium Wednesday.
This year’s conference focus is “The Mediterranean Re-Imagined” in honor of late Georgetown professor Faruk Tabak, author of “The Waning of the Mediterranean, 1550-1870: A Geohistorical Approach.”
Burke’s keynote address, “Models of Mediterranean Modernity: The Perspective from the Longue Durée,” emphasized the Mediterranean’s centrality to a broader world history.
“In this talk, I seek to reexamine against the background of world history how the Mediterranean came to modernity,” Burke, who is also director of UC Santa Cruz’s Center for World History, said. “Middle Eastern problems are not just Middle Eastern problems.”
Ecologic and economic factors were key in shaping the history of the many regions that surround the Mediterranean, Burke added. In particular, the Little Ice Age, a period of significant cooling in temperatures that affected Europe from the mid-14th to 19th century, precipitated to a great decline in the continent’s relative prosperity.
“The Little Ice Age cumulatively devastates Mediterranean agriculture,” Burke said.
The Mediterranean’s population, which was equal to China’s population in 1000 CE, was only one-fourth of the Chinese population by 1800, he added.
Despite the negative impact of the Little Ice Age, Burke said, Europe achieved preeminence as the world’s most powerful region in great part because of the economic benefits it reaped from its exploration and later colonization of the New World.
“Europe’s overseas colonies provided a strategic advantage in the new local struggle for empire,
Burke said. “As a result it achieved results well above the new global norms.”
However, before global colonization, the Mediterranean Sea helped civilizations in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa prosper. The role of the sea in precipitating cross-cultural maritime trade guaranteed Mediterranean-based peoples certain economic advantages over those who did not have access to warm water ports.
“For millennia, the prosperity of the region was ensured,” Burke said.
However, the rise of trade routes through Indian and then Atlantic Oceans reduced the sea’s importance to Northern Europe.
While Mediterranean countries today take advantages of oil reserves, the region was at a developmental disadvantage during the Industrial Revolution due to its lack of coal and iron. This, in particular, stymied the process of industrialization in much of the Arab world.
“It’s a time when we can begin to start to rethink the modern Arab world in bigger ways and indeed in global ways,” Burke said.
Burke is currently working on a book, “The History of the Modern Mediterranean, 1450-1950,” that will examine themes from his keynote address.
Nabil Matar, professor of English at the University of Minnesota, said he thought Burke underemphasized some aspects of Europe’s dominance of Mediterranean cultures.
“This is, in my view, not sufficient. In my view there is also the military side,” Matar said, citing British and French attacks on Mediterranean infrastructure.
Matar presented his own work on the Mediterranean as an obstacle to Arab cartography at the symposium Thursday afternoon.
