Hoyas United for Free Speech, a new student group advocating for free speech reform on campus, delivered its petition to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson on Friday.
The petition, which has so far garnered roughly 460 signatures, includes demands for the expansion of free speech zones on campus, the diversification of viewpoints included in class curriculum and the expansion of accessibility for students with disabilities.
Around 15 students involved with HUFS met in Red Square and walked together to Olson’s office in the Leavey Center. Before delivering the petition, they stopped in Sellinger Lounge, where they chanted “When free speech is under attack, what do we do, we fight back!”
“We went up to his office, we knocked on his door, he answered, we handed him the petition and we tried to explain to him a little bit about what’s going on in the petition but he said he was on a conference call and then disappeared back into his office,” HUFS founder Vincent DeLaurentis (SFS ’17) said.
Olson said that after receiving the petition, he reviewed the demands carefully and will respond to them shortly.
“There are several issues we will be discussing in the Speech and Expression Committee in the weeks ahead,” Olson wrote in an email. “On the safe spaces questions, I will note that we are committed to preserving the distinctive identities and physical safe spaces of CMEA, the Women’s Center and the LGBTQ Resource Center. We have launched a working group on disability justice, and that group is exploring some of the issues raised here. Current work led by the Provost’s Office, and directly involving students, is exploring the curricular questions that are raised in the petition.”
Olson said that although the university is still considering how to structure its work on diversity issues, it is committed to maintaining three distinct spaces for the CMEA, the Women’s Center and the LGBTQ Resource Center.
According to DeLaurentis, the petition outlined a two-week deadline for a response from Olson.
“We expect him to provide a substantive response to the proposal within two weeks, and if that doesn’t happen or if the response provided isn’t substantive, then we will be forced to continue with our campaign,” DeLaurentis said.
The petition lists seven demands for free speech policy changes: eliminating specified free speech zones on campus in favor of a more universal policy, immediately expanding tabling areas to the sidewalks in front of Healy Hall and around Healy Circle, recruiting a more diverse group of speakers for events on campus, preserving and expanding safe spaces such as the LGBTQ Resource Center, Women’s Center and CMEA, creating a funding system for American Sign Language removing tables used by student groups from the list of “permanent structures” in the Speech and Expression Policy and creating new academic course requirements that highlight underrepresented viewpoints on campus.
The university’s current Speech and Expression Policy permits students to table in designated Free Speech Zones, which include Regents Lawn, Red Square, the HealeyFamily Student Center and the lobby of the Leavey Center.
HUFS, a group of around 30 students that formed to create this petition, consists of students from various campus groups and a number of unaffiliated students. The petition has garnered around 15 club endorsements, as well, from groups including H*yas for Choice, GU Fossil Free and the Georgetown Solidarity Committee.
HUFS member Ida Dhanuka (SFS ’17) said that she joined the group to express her desire for an academic environment that encourages diversity of opinion.
“Basically we’re a group of concerned students that want to expand the protection of speech on campus,” Dhanuka said. “You can’t have an institution of learning without free and open discussion and discourse, that’s really central to being a learning institution and being a Jesuit school I think, being able to talk about issues that come up in an unfettered way.”
HUFS member Lexi Dever (COL ’16) said that her involvement in the campaign was sparked by her affiliation with the LGBTQ community.
“I definitely firmly believe in the right of all students at any university to be able to engage in free discussion and ideas, that’s why we’re here,” Dever said. “Since I belong to a community that previously had been in a marginalized position in this school … I realized that the communities that are ignored harms the Georgetown community as a whole because they don’t get to hear what they have to say. Any form of restriction on free speech on campus is a restriction on our ability to learn and better engage with our beliefs and ideals.”
For HUFS member Erin Riordan (COL ’15), the campaign offered a chance to diversify curricula.
“In my experience, there are some views that we hear over and over again and they are really protected by the university,” Riordan said. “They’re powered by the university in terms of what speakers we bring to campus, who’s given the most right to free speech on campus, who’s included on our syllabi, what our core classes look like. … I think this gives us a very unbalanced education and Georgetown students deserve better.”
Riordan said that many classes she has taken on campus failed to provide balanced sources on themes and topics of discussion.
“[We hear] a lot of voices of people who have power and have had power for basically all of time. … I’ve been in classes where we exclusively read the work of white men, it needs to be balanced,” Riordan said. “You don’t here a lot of outside voices or outside experience unless you look for it yourself. The dominant culture is very neo-liberal, it’s very pro-capitalism, and there isn’t a lot of questioning of these ideas.”
Georgetown University Student Association President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said that GUSA fully supports the actions of HUFS, although the two groups are unaffiliated.
“The group has not yet reached out to us but we support the aims as they’re stated and think that students forming together to advocate for these issues is important and the only way to make the improvements that we clearly need in our speech and expression policies,” Tezel said.

The dominant culture is very neo-liberal, it’s very pro-capitalism, and there isn’t a lot of questioning of these ideas.”
You’ve got to be kidding me.  Yes, it’s a highly unfortunate fact that up until the late 18th/early 19th century, women were not really involved in academia.  However, it’s utterly ridiculous to pillory Georgetown for supposedly only teaching the work of white men.  When you’re in an intro to philosophy, political theory, or theology class, historical fact dictates that what you’re going to get is the work of “dead white men.”  To complain otherwise is to lobby for something not rooted in fact, which clearly the person quoted here is doing.
May I suggest the following classes in which to enroll next semester?

D.C. voters will head to the polls today to vote on Initiative 71, a proposal that would legalize the use and cultivation of recreational marijuana in the District.
If the initiative is passed, adults over the age of 21 will be legally allowed to possess up to two ounces of marijuana. The initiative will also permit the home cultivation of up to six marijuana plants as long as only three or fewer are mature. Although the sale of marijuana will still be prohibited, up to one ounce of marijuana will be able to be given as a gift, and the sale of products for the use or cultivation of marijuana will be legalized.
A recent Washington City Paper poll placed support for legalization at 52 percent.
In anticipation of the initiative’s passage, the D.C. Council passed a bill on Oct. 28 to seal the criminal records of D.C. residents who have been convicted of non-violent marijuana-related crimes.
“We need to say to people previously charged with these crimes that they don’t need to have it impact their lives forever,” Councilmember at Large David Grosso (LAW ’01), who introduced the bill, told The Hoya. “The point is to give a little bit back to the people most impacted by the failed war on drugs.”
If the initiative passes, it must undergo a 60-day Congressional review period. In 1998, D.C. residents voted to legalize medical marijuana, but Congressional delay tactics prevented the council from implementing the plan until 2009. Since such action would require approval from the Senate, the House and the president, the current political climate makes a delay from Congress unlikely.
If Congress or the D.C. Council does not act within those 60 days, the initiative will become law.
The initiative does not permit sale of marijuana, only possession. Grosso noted that the D.C. Council will likely delay the implementation of legalization until the creation of a comprehensive tax-and-regulation system. Grosso already introduced a bill to add this regulatory framework but expected the process to take a year, if not longer.
“Sometime between Oct. 1 and Jan. 1 of next year is plenty of time for us to get the regulatory framework in place and have a marketplace where you can buy and sell marijuana legally,” Grosso said.
Together with the D.C. Cannabis Campaign, the Drug Policy Alliance, the nation’s leading organization against the war on drugs, has led the campaign in support of Initiative 71.
Drug Policy Alliance Office of National Affairs Policy Manager Malik Burnett said that the money gained from taxing and selling marijuana could help solve the disparity in economic outcomes throughout the District, estimating profits from the industry at tens of millions of dollars each year.
“What we can do once we effectively tax and regulate marijuana is to use the proceeds from that taxation to appropriately reinvest in the development of those communities,” he said.
If Initiative 71 passes, D.C. will join Colorado and Washington to become the third place in America where recreational marijuana is legalized.
Students who are registered as D.C. voters will be able to vote on Initiative 71. The ballot will reiterate the suggested parameters of marijuana use and possession.
Students posted signs in Red Square that encouraged students to vote on behalf Initiative 71. “Let your voice be heard! Vote yes on 71,” one of the signs said.
Ari Shapiro (SFS ’18), a resident of Denver, said he supports legalization for the District, provided that D.C. follows Colorado’s model, noting that the legislation has not significantly changed life in his home state.
“[Legalization] reduces excessive prison costs and incarceration rates it raises significant tax revenues, and it allows a potentially dangerous substance to be controlled and regulated,” Shapiro said. “In Colorado, legalization hasn’t radically altered society as many thought it might, and D.C. should be no different.”
Students registered to vote in D.C. can vote Tuesday at the Georgetown Community Library, located on R Street. Other elections on the ballot are the D.C. mayoral race, delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives, Chairman of the Council, At-Large member of the Council, D.C. Attorney General, U.S. Senator, U.S. Representative and Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner.

D.C. Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), D.C. Councilmember David Catania (I-At Large) (SFS ’90, LAW ’94) and former councilmember Carol Schwartz, an independent, will face off today in D.C.’s mayoral election.
Bowser, the Democratic nominee, defeated incumbent Mayor Vincent Gray in the April primary. The recipient of endorsements from President Barack Obama and The Washington Post, she has maintained a constant lead over Catania and Schwartz in the polls, though Catania has recently seen a surge in support, trailing just four points behind Bowser in an Oct. 4 poll conducted by veteran D.C. pollster Ron Lester.
Both former Republicans, Catania and Schwartz turned independent after the party became increasingly conservative, with Catania changing his affiliation in 2004 and Schwartz, a five-time mayoral candidate, changing her status this year.
Public policy professor Mark Rom noted that the candidates fall along traditional party lines, identifying Bowser as the ardent Democrat, Catania as a moderate and Schwartz as the most conservative.
“[The candidates] differ in fairly predictable ways … and they each basically assume the goals that are consistent with their parties,” Rom said.
Hans Noel, an associate professor in the government department, agreed, highlighting the difference between Bowser and Catania, who largely resemble one another on issues of policy, as one primarily of style.
“That dimension between old school and the new way of doing things,” Noel said. “It’s really more of a question of here’s a person that’s a generic Democrat, versus here’s an outsider kind of person, who generally wants to accomplish the same kind of things.”
Lester’s Oct. 4 poll estimated Bowser’s support at 34 percent, Catania’s at 30 percent and Schwartz’s at 16 percent, with 19 percent undecided — a much closer race than the 17-point lead Bowser held in an NBC4/Washington Post poll conducted in September.
Despite the narrowing margins, Rom hypothesized that the District’s demographic makeup and recent events such as the Post’s endorsement provide Bowser with an advantage in today’s election.
“Democrats make up three-fourths of the registered voters in D.C,” Rom said. “Part of the reason of that is that it’s been a largely African-American city, and African-Americans historically vote heavily Democratic, so that’s the basis they’re working from, and Catania’s really trying to break through that. One of the big questions then for the election is, will black voters in the District vote for a white mayor? And I think race is not necessarily the major thing people vote on but it’s a factor they consider: Do you want to have someone as the mayor that kind of looks like me?” If elected, Catania would be the District’s first white mayor, the first openly gay mayor and the first non-Democrat mayor ever.
Aside from Catania, the city’s history looms large as voters express exasperation with the political corruption that plagued the District in the 1980s and reared its head again earlier this year with revelations of illegal campaign fundraising by Gray in his 2010 mayoral campaign.
“[There is] a weariness among voters about the same old, same old, we get the same old politicians, we get the same old corruption problems,” Rom said. “I think that voters in a large part will make decisions based on who they think will be the least corrupt possible mayor.”
A 2011 study based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress found that Washington, D.C. has the largest achievement gap between minority and white students in the country. All three candidates aim to reform the educational system, making the issue a focal point of the campaign.
Throughout the race, Catania, who served as chairman of the Council’s education committee, has criticized Bowser for being “uninformed” on educational issues, pointing to his detailed education policy for comparison. Catania has centered his campaign around the issue, forming the “Public School Parents for Catania” group to increase funding for at-risk schools and reform the special education system. He has also proposed new methods of measuring student and teacher performance and test scores, and increased autonomy for individual schools.
Bowser has emphasized reforming the District’s middle schools.
“We have to make sure there’s a more deliberate and focused way of providing high-quality middle school options to parents and children across the district,” Bowser campaign Communications Director Joaquin McPeek said. “In her first term she wants to create four new middle schools.”
McPeek also emphasized Bowser’s commitment to keep Education Chancellor Kaya Henderson in office.
Schwartz also stated in her platform that she will keep Henderson as chancellor and promised that she will remain dedicated to ensuring teacher quality by encouraging creative teaching. She has also advocated for more charter and vocational schools.
Gray’s redistricting plan of public school boundaries for the 2015-2016 school year, which would give at-risk students preference in lotteries for out-of-boundary spots, has arisen as a major point of contention during the election. Bowser and Catania have both opposed this plan, arguing that it would exacerbate inequality already present in the D.C Public Schools system. Catania plans to move forward with redistricting after a year. Schwartz stated in her Education Position Paper that she would “accept the need for new boundaries, but make modifications where necessary.”
The District has seen rents rise 50 percent and home prices double in the past decade, despite the presence of a constant level of family income, according to the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute.
According to her platform, Bowser will attempt to produce more affordable housing, increasing the available spaces by 10,000 units a year and encouraging home ownership to prevent displacement.
Catania proposed a low-income housing tax credit as well as supporting mixed-income developments, in addition to Bowser’s proposed steps , to address the problem. Schwartz has promised to immediately allocate more funding to the Local Rental Support Program to provide relief to renters but largely agreed with increased developments of affordable housing.
The affordable housing problem is compounded by Gray’s plan to close the D.C General Homeless Center within the next year and an estimated 16 percent rise in homelessness in D.C this winter. Bowser and Catania have supported closing the shelter, though Schwartz has argued for remodeling the facility instead.
Both Catania and Bowser have been criticized for failing to support the Large Retailer Accountability Act last year, which would have required large retailers, primarily WalMart, to pay employees a minimum wage of $12.50. However, both candidates supported raising the minimum wage to $11.50 by 2016, a change that is in progress. Schwartz stated that, if she were on the council, she would have supported the measure to raise the minimum wage as well.
Despite historically low turnout in the April primary, The Washington Post reported Monday that a record 25,302 early ballots had been cast in the general election, nearly double the total early ballots of the 2010 election.
However, in contrast to this increased turnout, Georgetown University College Democrats Chair Chandini Jha (COL ’16) said that Georgetown students were generally uninterested in D.C. politics.
“If you’re a resident of D.C. who’s not a student, you’re more likely to go out and vote, whereas students don’t have those strong ties — we’re only here for four years — although D.C. elections really do affect us in terms of the way we live on and off campus,” Jha said. “At Georgetown very few students are registered to vote in the District because they want to have more electoral power in their home states and they vote absentee.”
D.C. allows same-day registration, allowing students to register and vote at the same time. Rom encouraged students who had not already voted in their home states to cast their ballots today.
“I would urge Georgetown voters to take a look at each of the three candidates and make an informed choice about who would be best for the city and who would be best for Georgetown,” he said.

The university hired Fr. Gregory Schenden, S.J., as its newest Roman Catholic chaplain in July, replacing Fr. Patrick Rogers, S.J., who previously served as the director of Catholic chaplaincy, a role that the Office of Mission and Ministry has transformed into two positions.
According to Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., Director of Liturgy, Music and Catholic Life Jim Wickman will address the administrative side of the position, while Schenden will focus strictly on the pastoral side.
Schenden said the diversity of student life and inclusive atmosphere drew him to Georgetown.
“I’m surprised in the best of ways on a daily basis in terms of what goes on here,” Schenden said. “First, the campus ministry itself. You look down the hallway and you have me and our Protestant chaplain and Rabbi Rachel [Gartner] and Imam [Yahya] Hendi and we just brought on our Hindu chaplain, and we’ve got an Orthodox chaplain. This is so much a part of what a Jesuit institute of higher learning is about in terms of the diversity.”
Schenden has the original proposal written by John Carroll for the Georgetown Academy hanging on his office wall, which he said echoes the ideas of the university being open to all religions. “I’m not just Catholic chaplain to Catholic community but to the entire campus,” Schenden said. “It’s this notion that we are all walking this faith journey together, in very unique ways, but together.”
Schenden added that he is impressed by the students with whom he has interacted so far on campus.
“It’s not just a quest for intellectual knowledge, but there is also a spiritual hunger that goes,” Schenden said. “This is a place where that kind of searching and that kind of conversation can occur.”
Born and raised in Detroit, Schenden studied at John Carroll University in Cleveland. Schenden said that at that point, he was not interested in entering the priesthood.
“I had no idea what I wanted to be, it was something that unfolded over the course of my 20s,” Schenden said.
After graduating with a degree in English, Schenden moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked in the financial office of the transportation research board for the National Academy of Science.
Schenden said that when he became interested in joining the priesthood, he was especially interested in the Jesuit order.
“Jesuits are the really intellectual ones,” Schenden said. “They are also just regular people: down to earth, funny, doing something they are called to do.”
After preaching at the neighboring Holy Trinity parish for five years, Schenden spent a year in the Philippines completing his final stage of Jesuit formation. In the Philippines, he faced separatists, insurrections, an earthquake and a super-typhoon, but said was inspired by the community he was a part of.
“What stands out most is the resilience of the people, incredible people, in the midst of real adversity,” Schenden said. “Just this notion of ‘We will rise from this.’ That’s a faith-filled experience, to be able to say we will rise from such supreme tragedy.”
O’Brien said Schenden’s enthusiasm to engage with students will benefit the campus ministry.
“We are delighted to have Fr. Schenden with us. He brings much enthusiasm to the position, and is able to engage young people where they are at,” O’Brien said. “He is an excellent preacher and very approachable and down to earth. He also brings a deep commitment to social justice, which was only solidified during the last year he spent in the Philippines.”
Schenden said the responses of the Georgetown community to challenges in the past few months, such as the death of Andrea Jaime (NHS ’17), have been characterized by a similar strength and sense of community he experienced in the Philippines.
“I’ll never forget the prayer vigil that night that came together on such short notice, how powerful that was for me and for everybody there,” Schenden said. “We come together in classrooms and football games, but we come together in the midst of our struggles, in the midst of our sufferings, in the midst of mourning.”
Schenden said that while he is beginning to feel more at home at Georgetown, he is still adjusting to this new experience.
“The challenge is, I’m a freshman here, too. … Becoming part of a new community with its own distinct culture is challenging. I’m learning new stuff every day,” he said.
One of the first students to welcome Schenden to Georgetown was Knights of Columbus Grand Knight Chris Cannataro (MSB ’15), who worked with Schenden as a liaison between the Knights of Columbus and Catholic Chaplaincy.
“Fr. Schenden is a very prayerful man, someone who has a passion for his faith and who also has a passion for watching students grow,” Cannataro said. “Additionally he’s a good guy to talk to, he’s very down to earth and he has a great sense of humor.”
Schenden emphasized his sincere wish to engage with as many members of the Georgetown community as possible. “The door is always open, I keep the door open,” Schenden said. “Reach out, I’m around, stop by.”

Georgetown Heritage, a new nonprofit organization created by the Georgetown Business Improvement District, is working toward renewing the Georgetown, a barge that once took tourists along the historical Chesapeake and Ohio Canal before structural damage and budget cuts ended the program in 2011.
The C&O National Historical Park under the National Park Service sponsored an educational boat trip for about 30 years, from the early 1990s until 2011, but could no longer afford the maintenance due to federal budget cuts in 2011, according to C&O Canal Historical Park Ranger Rebecca Jameson.
“[The barge] had structural damage that was too extensive to repair because of the age of the boat,” Jameson said.
Jameson added that the Georgetown Visitor Center of the Canal Park completely closed down this year due to the extensive structural damage faced by the Georgetown.
Daniel Filer, partnership coordinator of the C&O National Historical Park, said the irreparable state of the Georgetown boat forced the park to look for an expensive replacement, but the high cost made it impractical for the Park Service to continue its search.
“The boat in Georgetown is actually beyond repair. Essentially, the boat needs to be replaced and retire. I don’t know how much the new boats cost, but they are expensive,” Filer said.
The Georgetown BID, in its neighborhood improvement plan “Georgetown 2028,” decided to pick up where the park service left off and identified preservation of the canal as one of the items on its agenda.
“Something that a lot of community members would really want to see was the boat brought back to Georgetown,” Director of Georgetown Heritage Maggie Downing, the destination manager of Georgetown BID, said. “So the Georgetown BID, through our conversation with the National Park Service, realized that we really needed a group dedicated to working on the canal as well as other initiatives in the neighborhood related to interpreting Georgetown history. …There are lots of wonderful stories — but they aren’t told right now — about the neighborhood history.”
Georgetown Heritage was born of Georgetown BID’s desire to draw attention to the issue. The nonprofit functions as a fundraising community organization that will prioritize work on the C&O Canal, specifically for historical education.
“The creation of Georgetown Heritage came about because of the C&O Canal,” Downing said. “We saw this need to bring back the boat to our program, to bring educational programs back to the Georgetown section of the canal and to preserve this amazing asset, this wonderful historical site and natural resource, that we have in our community.”
Georgetown Heritage aims to fundraise through both private and public channels, including the National Park Foundation. The new partnership between the National Park foundation and Georgetown Heritage began in August 2014, and the National Park Service is already directly involved in forming a fundraising plan.
“We want to match private donors with federal funds and city funds. It’s a great private-public partnership that we are looking to create,” Downing said. “They were very involved from the beginning in the process of creating Georgetown Heritage, and we have regular meetings and conversations with them about friend group agreements and the projects that we are working on together.”
The 184.5-mile long C&O Canal runs parallel to the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., to Cumberland, Md. Commercially used from 1831 to 1924, the “Grand Old Ditch” witnessed the history of western expansion, the Civil War and industrialization. According to Jameson, a trip on the Georgetown along the well-preserved canal would transport tourists back in time to the days when the canal was frequently used.
“The C&O Canal is one of the largest intact, early 19th-century canals. We actually have functional lift walk, so the boats were able to run through lift walk just like they were when the canal was in operation,” Jameson said. “The boat would actually go through a lock, so you can see how the locks work and move the materials from the canal. And park rangers who were in period costumes would explain about the history of the canal and the people who were living on it,”
Jameson added that the Georgetown section of the canal boasts an excellent geographical location within Washington, D.C., as the start of the waterway.
“Georgetown is a highly visited section of our canal, so it’s good to have an operation there with the visitors to experience the park,” Jameson said. “It’s also the start of the canal, so it’s another significant site of the canal.”
Although fundraising has not yet begun as Georgetown Heritage waits for official confirmation of its nonprofit status, leaders of the organization are reaching out to the Georgetown community in preparation of an official capital campaign in early 2015.
“Right now, we are really looking forward to building a constituency,” Downing said. “We are sharing with the members of the Georgetown community our plan and ideas for the canal, trying to get them excited and recruit our board of directors.”

Georgetown’s number of early admissions applicants for the Class of 2019 remained steady this year, continuing the trend of little to no change in the early applicant pool over the past four years.
As of Saturday morning, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions had received 6,624 applications for the Nov. 1 early action deadline, and the office expects to see more in the next few days, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said. Since Nov. 1 fell on a Saturday this year, Georgetown will continue to accept applications mailed via postal service and postmarked Nov. 1 through the beginning of this week.
“I’m guessing it’ll come out to be almost exactly what it was last year, maybe a little ahead,” Deacon said.
The current 6,624 early action applications number is slightly lower than last year’s 6,749 early applicants for the Class of 2018, although exact comparisons will not be determined until all applications are received by mail this week. The number of early action applications peaked with 6,840 in 2013 for the Class of 2017, following 6,831 in 2012 for the Class of 2016 and 6,655 in 2011 for the Class of 2015.
More information about the breakdown of this year’s early action applicants will be available when all applications have been received.
Georgetown offers an early action application, which is non-binding and allows high school students to apply early to other universities that also offer early action options. Applicants will receive news of acceptance or deferral to the regular-decision cycle — with no rejections in the early action round — on Dec. 15. Applicants will have until May 1 to choose whether to enroll at Georgetown.
Last year, 955 out of 6,749 early applicants were accepted to the Class of 2018.
Out of 19,501 total applicants for the Class of 2018, 2,227 applicants were accepted regular decision. The total acceptance rate for the current freshman class, combining early action and regular decision, was 16.6 percent, with a yield of 46 percent.
Deacon expects the Class of 2019’s total acceptance rate to be about 17 percent, and the early action acceptance rate to be no more than 17 percent. The Office of Admissions will again aim for a 1,580-student freshman class, keeping the total number of undergraduates under 6,675, as is dictated in the 2010 Campus Plan Agreement.
The number of early action applications acts as a predictor for the overall number of applications to come, making up an average of about 34 percent of total applications. This year’s early applications predict an overall applicant pool between 19,000 and 20,000, consistent with the last four years, Deacon said. Last year, Georgetown had 19,501 total applicants.
“You can basically predict the overall pool based on how many early actions you have. So if that holds true, unless there’s some big aberration, that means once we have that number we’ll be able to project the overall pool,” Deacon said.
Deacon pointed to declining numbers of high school graduates nationwide since 2010 as a factor in the number of college applicants nationwide and to Georgetown.
In light of declining high school graduation rates, thus producing fewer college applicants, Deacon said that he would consider Georgetown’s steady number of applicants to be a success.
“For us, staying even is actually, we think, getting ahead,” he said.
Demographically, high school graduation rates are falling among non-Hispanic whites and increasing among Hispanics. According to a Pew Research Center analysis in May 2013 based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, a record high of 69 percent of Hispanic graduates in the Class of 2012 enrolled in college that fall, two points above the 67 percent of graduating non-Hispanic white students enrolling. This upward trend in Hispanic enrollment reflects a corresponding upward trend in Hispanics graduating high school. In 2011, 14 percent of Hispanics between the ages of 16 and 24 were high school dropouts, a marked reduction from 28 percent in 2000. The non-Hispanic white population saw only a 2-point reduction in high school dropouts from 2000 to 2011.
Deacon said that he hopes Georgetown will be able to attract more Hispanic applicants this year.
He added that Georgetown’s widespread visibility helps to maintain the university’s even application rates.
“We began the year saying that if we could maintain the same number that would be a successful numeric number,” Deacon said. “So far, so good.”
Final early admissions numbers will be available later this week. Regular decision applications are due Jan. 10, and applicants will be notified on April 1.

One year after the Center for Student Engagement discontinued its What’s After Dark program due to university-wide budget cuts, several groups, including the Georgetown Program Board, Relay for Life and the Black Student Association continue to face difficulties in funding late-night programs.
These groups traditionally used What’s After Dark funding for various nighttime events, including GPB’s Spring Concert and the Midnight Breakfast during finals week.
What’s After Dark was cancelled last year so that the funding could be redirected toward the construction and programming in Healey Family Student Center, which will have its own late night programs in coordination with GPB.
“The Center for Student Engagement made the decision to phase out What’s After Dark funding last year in the face of fiscal constraints, knowing that this academic year would bring new opportunities for late -night and weekend programming in the Healey Family Student Center,” Center for Student Engagement Director Erika Cohen Derr wrote in an email.
Cohen Derr said that she anticipates that late-night programming will move to the HFSC, which includes a film screening room, as well as the Bulldog Tavern, which is set to open Friday, pending the approval of its license.
“The full-time and student staff members managing the HFSC have experience in late-night and weekend programming, and the center has brought new opportunities to partner with student organizations like Georgetown Program Board, WGTB and many others,” Cohen Derr wrote. “We’re excited to make programming the focus of the space, now that the final construction is coming to an end.”
Groups that offer late-night programming that is unrelated to HFSC are still struggling due to the funding cuts, though.
GPB Late Night Committee Chair Nick Bailey (MSB ’17) said that the funding cut has continued to be a challenge for the group throughout the past year.
“The termination of What’s After Dark last year put an end to a lot of the late-night programming at Georgetown,” Bailey wrote in an email. “Since the cancellation of What’s After Dark, we’ve been doing our best to make up for the loss. We haven’t received any additional funding, however, so it’s been very difficult.”
Bailey also said that the lack of financial support for late-night programs may result in a decrease in the quality of events.
“The Spring Concert has come to rely on additional funding from What’s After Dark, and the loss of this funding will definitely have an impact on the type of concert we can afford to program,” Bailey wrote. “Another event I’ve worked on directly with What’s After Dark in the past is The Amazing Race, and the struggle this year is to try to conserve costs enough to still have the event without them.”
Additionally, the cancellation of What’s After Dark has also led to a decrease in GPB staff members.
“The loss of What’s After Dark is not just a financial one, however, and the loss of staff members who were dedicated to putting on late- night events is one we cannot recoup,” Bailey wrote. “Overall, the loss of What’s After Dark has seriously changed the landscape of late-night programming at Georgetown.”
Relay for Life Co-President Cayla Fappiano (NHS ’15) said that Relay is also facing difficulties after the funding cancellation. Although the Center for Social Justice and the Advisory Board for Student Organizations offered financial support for the event last year to compensate for the funding loss, they will not do so again this spring, according to Fappiano.
“This year, we are not in the same situation and will need to find other campus and corporate sponsors to support the cost of inflatables and activities at our event, otherwise it may look very different this year,” Fappiano said.

A female Georgetown University student was sexually assaulted in the Intercultural Center building on Sunday Oct. 26 at approximately 4:30 a.m., according to an email sent out by the Georgetown University Police Department. The assailant, an acquaintance of the survivor, is not affiliated with Georgetown University.
According to GUPD Chief Jay Gruber, the survivor reached out to GUPD through alternative channels, which he did not disclose, on Saturday at approximately 4:30 p.m., about a week after the incident occurred.
Gruber said that all buildings on campus are supposed to be locked or GoCard-protected at night, but sometimes locks do not work or students prop open doors, preventing the doors from remaining locked.
“The ICC is not supposed to be open 24-7, it’s supposed to be locked down. But sometimes infrastructure doesn’t cooperate with us,” Gruber said.
There are CCTV cameras set up inside the ICC, but the location of the assault in the ICC has not been disclosed.
Gruber said that throughout his time here at Georgetown, he has never seen a similar sexual assault reported.
“In the tenure that I’ve been there, there have been [sexual assault incidents] in residence halls, but to my recollection, there’s never been in an academic or administrative building,” Gruber said.
According to Gruber, Georgetown’s sexual assault protocol allows the survivor to choose whether or not he or she wants GUPD to contact the Metropolitan Police Department.
“If the survivor comes to us and tells us they don’t want to participate in a criminal investigation, then the survivor doesn’t have to,” he said.
As the investigation is ongoing, Gruber declined to comment on any details of the investigation, including whether or not MPD would be involved or whether the survivor will be pressing charges with MPD.
MPD could not provide further information as of press time.

My heart goes out to this girl. I hope that she gets the support she needs and deserves from the Georgetown community.

I’m certainly shocked, but not too surprised this happened in the ICC. During my tenure at Georgetown the ICC was known as a place of last (or first!) resorts for hook ups. It’s unfortunate that the facility is so accessible as to allow this scenario to have played out.

What was the nature of the assault?  Rape?  Groping?  Unwelcome hug? Sounds pretty grave if the Hoya is referring to the victim as a “survivor”.

hoya alumna says 
November 6, 2014 at 10:37 am
Does it matter? Is she any less of a survivor or any less worthy of our sympathy and prayers if it was “just” groping? All sexual assault is “grave.”
Hoping and praying that she’ll be able to get through all of this.

hoyalum says 
November 7, 2014 at 12:59 pm
Yes and yes. You may call a pat on the rear end a “grave” assault (which is an insult to rape victims) but our society  disagrees with you (through the laws that it’s representatives pass).  Jerks don’t get years in jail for that  as they shouldn’t.

hoya says 
November 5, 2014 at 4:49 pm
This was not an “unwelcome hug,” but rather a violent rape. Entering the ICC was not done with the intention of hooking up, but with the intention of using the restroom. Also, jokes that the ICC is supposed to be locked. Has anyone ever been locked out? The door sure wasn’t propped open either.

hoyalum says 
November 7, 2014 at 12:54 pm
Hoya did not report a “violent rape”

hoya says 
November 10, 2014 at 11:44 am
as the person this article is about, I’m telling you that’s what it was

hoyalum says 
November 12, 2014 at 9:29 am
I am so sorry… my thoughts and prayers are with you and I hope the rapist does serious time in jail+   
I wonder why the Hoya reported this so vaguely.

hoyalum says 
December 10, 2014 at 10:26 pm
The Georgetown community deserves follow-up reporting on this story.  Is there a rapist on the loose?  Are students in danger?  
Shall we assume that the survivor did not press charges because we would have read about it in the Hoya?

After the Outdoor Student Living Pilot Program expanded to allow students to drink wine and beer in more outdoor locations on campus in August, the Georgetown University Police Department and the Office of Residential Living have cited minimal problems, touting the program as a success.
This fall, the program expanded to allow students who are 21 or older to drink in designated outdoor areas around Nevils, LXR, the Leavey Esplanade and the Alumni Square Courtyard. The pilot program began in August 2013, allowing students of legal age to drink wine and beer outdoors in areas of Henle Village and Village A.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said that the program has proven to be successful in its early months, with few complaints registered to GUPD.
“We have a set of policies around alcohol use and social life that are designed to respect the law, keep students safe and healthy and encourage student social life on campus,” Olson wrote in an email. “The notable policy change related to open containers provides a setting for small outdoor gatherings with alcohol in some residential areas on campus. I am encouraged by the collaborative work on that, and by the early success of that initiative.”
Director of Student Conduct Judy Johnson said she hopes that granting this new freedom to students will encourage them to behave appropriately to ensure student safety.
“The hope is that when allowing open containers in a specific area, students will behave in an orderly manner and abide by the policies,” Johnson said. “I think we are always open to the idea of discussing what would be helpful for students to feel relaxed and maintain a good social life on campus. We want to balance the idea of relaxation and social life on campus with what abides by the law and respects our neighbors.”
Johnson said that although the program has been successful thus far, she fears that students may misunderstand the policy in the upcoming months.
“The difficulty comes when students may not realize that these are specified areas and travelling from one area to the next may cause students confusion,” Johnson said. “The identified areas pertain only to students who are 21 and older, and applies just to those areas, not for a student to go from [his or her] room to that space with an open container. It is confusing for students and I worry about students feeling misunderstood.”
According to Johnson, the open beverage policy on the Leavey Esplanade could prove to be a risk to student safety.
“The Leavey Esplanade will be more difficult to monitor for student safety,” Johnson said. “I can see that there would be difficulties there because many different people can access that and it is not immediately accessible from a residence hall. The coming and going could be very problematic.”
GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) worked with GUPD and the Office of Residential Living to expand the pilot program. Tezel said that this initiative is part of GUSA’s larger goal to create a more vibrant on-campus social life.
“If we want to truly create the residential campus that the university is aiming for, then we need to re-examine all of our social policies, including ones related to outdoor gatherings,” Tezel said.
According to Tezel, the success of the program has proven the responsibility of Georgetown students.
“Will it become an issue if there are a group of 30 students packed into the Henle courtyard throwing a party? Yes,” Tezel said. “But with the pilot program, we haven’t seen that. Georgetown students have shown they’re responsible drinkers.”
Although the policy is already in effect, GUPD continues to monitor the implementation of the policy with Residential Education in the Office of Residential Living. Tezel and Jikaria said that they are confident that students will continue to behave in accordance with the new policies.
“I think policy changes like this will put responsibility on Georgetown students for their own drinking habits and educate them on being smart about alcohol consumption,” Jikaria said. “That being said, we are constantly seeking feedback from students on this change and want to ensure that other students’ quality of life is not being adversely affected.”
Village A resident Jason Gusdorf (SFS ’16) said that although the pilot program contributes to high levels of noise, it is important for student life at Georgetown.
“Extending the open container policy lets students who are legally able to drink have more freedom in terms of the spaces they can be in, which is clearly something that is much needed,” Gusdorf said. “Of course living on a rooftop in Village A implies that there is going to be a high level of noise and a certain amount of partying, but I understood that when I signed up to live here, and it’s important for students to have these areas for social gatherings.”

The D.C. Council approved legislation to permit and regulate the operation of app-based ridesharing services such as uberX, Lyft and SideCar on Oct. 28. The Public Vehicle-for-hire Innovation Amendment Act, proposed by Councilmember Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3), passed in a 12-to-1 vote.
The bill retained the $1 million dollar insurance minimum for all rides originating in Washington, D.C., as well as yearly vehicle inspections that also apply to taxicabs, reducing the previous twice-yearly inspection requirement.
Additionally, ride-share drivers must be at least 21 and undergo criminal, DUI and traffic background checks from the past seven years, as well as a lifetime sex offender background checks. App-based ride sharing companies now must also register with the D.C. Taxicab Commission, giving the DCTC the power to enforce the regulations.
Because of what they perceived as insufficient regulation, the bill faced dissent from the DCTC and Mayor Vincent Gray, who urged the council to postpone its vote. DCTC Chairman Ron M. Linton expressed resigned acceptance of the bill but approved of its additional safety measures.
“The City Council sets public policy, and administrators have to work with it. There has been some strengthening of the enforceability of the requirements on private vehicles for hire that should improve the protection of public safety,” Linton wrote in an email.
Nevertheless, taxicab drivers’ opposition to the bill has remained steadfast. Drivers protested again outside of the Wilson Building while the council voted on the bill, although the bill does provide concessions to traditional taxi companies, now allowing drivers to live anywhere in Maryland or Virginia in addition to the District. Taxi companies with apps may now also adjust pricing based on specific requests, similar to the “surge pricing” model, or raising prices in situations of high demand, used by Uber and other companies.
Jim Graham(D-Ward 1), the lone councilmember to vote against the bill, maintained that it gives app-based riding services an unfair upper-hand over cab companies.
“For the council to allow self-regulation of these profit-making ventures is indeed like having the fox guard the chicken coop,” Graham said at the Oct. 28 council meeting.
Digital dispatch services uberX and Lyft disagreed, expressing support for the legislation and noting the steps already taken by the companies to ensure customer safety.
UberX released a statement on Wednesday celebrating the passage of the legislation.
“From the beginning, Uber has required extensive background checks, vehicle inspections and top quality insurance coverage. This legislation affirms that responsibility and ensures that uberX is the safest and most reliable way to get around the District,” the press release read.
Lyft Public Policy Communications Manager Chelsea Wilson agreed, also nothing that the service had previously instituted safety regulations of its own
“Safety is Lyft’s top priority,” Wilson wrote in an email. “While safety is often brought up as a reason to apply an old regulatory model to an innovative transportation solution, new technology actually provides an opportunity to increase safety above and beyond what has been done previously.”
Wilson addressed the complaints of taxicab drivers and Councilmember Graham, who fear the increased competition of ride sharing services will overtake the transportation market.
“We don’t see this as a zero sum game. Cities benefit from a diverse range of reliable, affordable and safe transportation alternatives, which all help people depend less on car ownership,” she wrote.
Adam Shinbrot (COL ’18) favored the increased regulations as a way to make him feel safer while using Uber.
“I have used Uber, and during one ride the driver was texting and that made me feel unsafe. I think more regulation of Uber is important. I don’t think Uber should be hiring sex offenders or people who have committed serious crimes because it just puts the public at risk,” he said.
Although he agreed with the benefits of background checks, Mark Vermylen (COL ’18) was uncomfortable with the council’s intervention into private businesses.
“The first time I used Uber was here at Georgetown. I’ve never felt unsafe using it, but I think background checks are a good thing given the amount of trust that is given to the drivers by the company. However, I don’t think these checks should be required by the government,” he said.

Sharsheret, a national nonprofit organization supporting young women of Jewish backgrounds fighting breast cancer, has partnered with the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center to evaluate and revamp its culturally relevant breast cancer support program.
With $350,000 in funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Sharsheret will work with the Cancer Center to determine how to use the funds to improve the LINK program, Sharsheret’s program that provides breast cancer support interventions, including peer support, genetics information and survivorship resources.
According to the CDC, more than 220,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States each year, and more than 40,000 women die annually as a result of the disease. Women of Eastern European or Ashkenazi Jewish backgrounds are more susceptible to developing the disease due to mutations found in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.
“We are honored to have been selected by the CDC to amplify out tailored breast cancer programming for young Jewish women,” Sharsheret Founder and Executive Director Rochelle Shortez said in an official press release. “In collaboration with more than 40 Sharsheret partners nationwide, we will work to serve more than 40,000 Jewish women and caregivers, enhancing the quality of life and reducing the cancer burden for young breast cancer survivors.”
Kenneth Tercyak, associate professor of oncology and pediatrics at the Lombardi Center, described the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center’s unique position at the forefront of breast cancer research as having the potential to contribute tangibly to Sharsheret’s mission.
“We are a [National Cancer Institute]-designated comprehensive cancer center, and conduct research across the continuum of basic science to clinical application to community translation and policy impact. We will bring this knowledge and skill to Sharsheret’s programs to help the population of women they serve,” Tercyak said. “Our partnership emerged as a result of the mutual interests shared by our two organizations in addressing the needs of women facing the threat of, and surviving with, breast cancer.”
Through the partnership, the Lombardi Center will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the LINK Program, ensuring that it is conducted through scientific methods and is well-tailored to the needs of young women. The multi-step process engaging various organizations and health agencies will allow the center to gain valuable insight into the operations of Sharsheret to set them up with improved breast cancer support programming and resources.
“We will then develop and use a number of performance metrics and indicators to determine the quality, quantity and logistics of breast cancer support program service delivery over time. This includes leveraging Sharsheret’s existing informatics resources about their population served, as well as gathering new data through interviews, focus groups and surveys,” Tercyak said.
Tercyak hoped that the evaluation would allow both Sharsheret and the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center to provide better support to more women through this collaboration, particularly focusing on women with genetic and genomic breast cancer risks and women from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds.
“Ultimately, the goal is to serve and support more women and to do so with highest quality programs that are guided by the best scientific evidence available,” Tercyak said.

Although the Office of Planning and Facilities Management announced plans to renovate the Intercultural Center to create new study spaces for students in the School of Foreign Service in February, plans have stalled as a result of budgetary concerns.
The university approved plans to create a new study space and add furniture to the areas by the elevators on the first and second floors in response to an Idea Scale petition created by the SFS Academic Council in February; the post currently has over 400 votes.
The Office of Planning and Facilities has added furniture on the first and second floors, but has not taken any substantive action toward the creation of a singular study space.
Ali Whitmer, chief of staff to the provost, said that the SFS is eager to make the ICC a more study-friendly space. The Office of the Provost exercises control over the ICC, which houses the SFS Deans’ Office, in addition to several academic departments.
“We are anxious to provide additional seating and study space for students, as has been asked of us by the SFS Council and many other students,” Whitmer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We believe we can do this in the immediate future with the furniture we’ve secured, while still balancing the many uses the galleria provides.”
Whitmer said that she hopes construction will begin soon and that the Office of the Provost has taken steps toward initiating construction, including conducting research on outlets, lighting and furniture concerns for the space.
“I also understand the desire to achieve more than what we’ve proposed in this first stage,” Whitmer wrote. “We want this to be a beautiful and functional student, faculty and administrative space and see this as stage one of a multi-stage project that we are working to fit responsibly within our budgets over several years.”
SFS Academic Council President Megan Murday (SFS ’15) attributed the delay in the project to a lack of resources and a low prioritization of the request.
“First and foremost, budgetary constraints have slowed improvements to the space,” Murday said. “The university has a finite amount of resources, and this project is not yet high enough on the list. However, I would argue that the university should prioritize renovations and updates to existing spaces, which are significantly cheaper than the construction of completely new buildings.”
Murday said that the addition of chairs to the elevator areas on the first and second floor are helpful, but fail to provide a longer-term solution.
“My hope is that such furniture will be a short-term fix while the university budgets for the full renovations and furniture investments necessary to create high-quality spaces to match the prestige of Georgetown,” Murday said.
Jinyoung Lee (SFS ’15), a senior representative on the SFS Academic Council, said that substantive problems in the ICC still need to be addressed, especially lighting and seating.
“Currently, the ICC Galleria has an inadequate number of chairs, desks, couches, outlets and lighting that we find many students having to sit on the floor while studying in between classes,” Lee said. “During the day, students rarely find seating space to chat with their professors, study in a group [and] participate in language table chats. During the night, students cannot study in the galleria because it has insufficient lighting.”
The SFS Academic Council hosted a town hall on study space Oct. 27, which allowed students to express their concerns to SFS Interim Dean James Reardon-Anderson and Associate Dean Mitch Kaneda. Nicolette Brownstein (SFS ’17) attended the town hall and said that both administrators seemed receptive to student concerns.
“They didn’t do a whole lot of talking while I was there,” Brownstein said. “They posed a couple of questions. Reardon-Anderson was definitely interested in what students were interested in, about whether students want classrooms at night, with the technology in the classrooms for projects and work during evening hours.”
Brownstein said she attended the event to express her concern that ICC space is not well utilized.
“One of the problems that I see is that the ICC is the central location for SFS kids and all kids and the space is not being fully maximized,” Brownstein said. “Almost every class is in that building [but] there are very few spaces that you can sit down and study.”
Brownstein said that the ICC could prove to be a beautiful and spacious area for students to work between classes.
“I think that there are a lot of really pleasant places to study,” Brownstein said. “I think the ICC Galleria during the day especially is such an open space with a lot of light and could possibly be a really nice place for people to meet or study or to have more spaces with the coffee shop, instead of just having it and leaving.”
The lack of study space in the ICC also affects business for More Uncommon Ground, a Students of Georgetown, Inc. storefront that is located in the galleria.
MUG Director Pat McDonough (MSB ’16) said that since students do not tend to spend extended periods of time in the ICC, large numbers of customers visit MUG during certain peak times, slowing the service.
“The big problem we see is that we only get busy during rush time, right before and after class, which means that customers have a really long wait time for their drinks … It leads to us having these big lulls when we don’t have any customer traffic, which is annoying for us from a revenue perspective and for customer experience,” McDonough said.
According to McDonough, increased study space would allow MUG to serve more customers and expand its hours.
“It would really help in off-peak hours, especially in the afternoon when big lectures are going on in the ICC Auditorium, as well as improve the customer experience, which would keep people coming back,” McDonough said. “During night time, we could have extended hours into the evening and provide dinner for people and things like that.”
McDonough said MUG staffers have petitioned administrators for study space in recent years with little success.
“We’re all behind having more study space. We’ve reached out several times to get the ball rolling, but we know that it’s a big project. We check in every year and try to get it going, and we always hear back that it’s a big financial investment for the university and that they’re working on it.”
Many students in the SFS spend most of their weekdays in the ICC, and Nick Ebert (SFS ’18) said that he is disappointed by the lack of quiet spaces to sit.
“I don’t feel like there’s any place for me to sit and do work,” Ebert said. “The atrium gets very loud during the day. It would be ideal if somewhere on the lower floors, where it’s very quiet, there’s a room where I could go. I have a lot classes in there and it would be good to just be close by to my classrooms.”
In addition to the SFS, a number of departments are housed in the ICC, including the government department, the economics department and many foreign language departments.
Esperanza Cirilo (SFS ’18) agreed and said that a defined study space would make time slots between her classes more efficient for getting work done.
“A lot of my classes are in the ICC,” Cirilo said. “I have between 20 minutes to an hour and a half between classes where I don’t want to leave. I would love to have a spot where I can go and do work. Because empty classrooms are really not available during the day. There’s not really tables available, so I just kind of sit on the floor. It’s not very comfortable and it’s not very conducive to doing work.”
Daniel Wassim (SFS ’18), a freshman representative on the SFS Academic Council, said that the renovations will help the ICC better represent the SFS.
“The ICC is the face of Georgetown’s premier institution, the SFS. And it’s not a pretty face,” Wassim said. “This is simply unacceptable for an institution of our caliber. The image of students sitting on the ground and studying in the ICC is an image of dereliction and neglect.”
The campaign for this new space is especially relevant after the creation of the Healey Family Student Center, which opened to students in September. Murday said she thinks that the success of the Healey Family Student Center reflects Georgetown students’ need and desire for more functional and effective study spaces
“High-quality academic space is a prerequisite for success as an institution of higher learning,” Murday said. “There is a real demand on campus for modern and functional study spaces. For example, the HFSC filled with new students immediately upon opening.”

At its November meeting, the 2E Advisory Neighborhood Commission on Monday evening granted alcohol licenses to four restaurants in the Georgetown area and debated the construction of a new shopping complex on the Prospect Street Lot. Around 35 people attended the meeting, held at Georgetown Visitation School.
The restaurants requesting alcohol licenses were J. Paul’s on M Street, along with Yummi Crawfish and two as-yet unnamed restaurants, all on Wisconsin Avenue.
A one new establishment will move into the space currently occupied by an antiques store at 1515 Wisconsin Ave., while the second establishment will be a pizza shop located at 1419 Wisconsin Ave. These three Wisconsin locations will be located directly adjacent to residents, prompting hesitation from the neighborhood residents.
“The neighbors are coming off some bad experiences,” ANC 2E Commissioner and Treasurer Jeff Jones said.
The ANC negotiated and unanimously passed agreements with each of the establishments to require early closures of the restaurants by 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and 10 p.m. on all other days.
“The neighbors came to our meeting in August with some serious concerns,” District 2E Commissioner and Vice-Chair Tom Birch said. “There is nothing unreasonable in this agreement.”
J. Paul’s, a restaurant located at 3218 M St., currently serves alcohol but was submitting its agreement to renew its alcohol license and obtain permission to house live entertainment. The rules stipulated in the agreement would require J. Paul’s to close all its windows during a live performance and prevent the restaurant from using outside promoters to garner performers.
Though District 2E Commissioner Bill Starrels expressed his support for the agreement to start the discussion, the lack of any regulation on the use of “disc jockeys” or other amplified performances led to a heated debate about more extensive regulations. Without resolution on the issue, the commission postponed a vote.
The commission then discussed the proposal for a new retail complex on Prospect Street in a parking lot opposite Cafe Milano and Mai Thai. Located at 3320 Prospect St., the old lot will be reconstructed into a retail space with a large underground garage. The original proposal in September called for 27,600 feet of retail space with a 101-space parking garage. The updated proposal includes 103 parking spaces, a 10 percent reduction in height for the whole complex, a shorter wall facing the adjacent residence and four main fronts for retail windows.
Project architect Kevin Sperry noted that the additions to the design would limit the impact of the project on the neighborhood.
“You don’t see that parking bay at all from Wisconsin Avenue,” Sperry said.
Starrels had concerns about trucks stuffing up traffic around Prospect Street, but Jones reported that other business on Prospect Street were supportive of the new retail project. Sperry estimated the project would most likely take between 14 and 15 months of work.
The ANC2E meets the first Monday of every month at the Georgetown Visitation School on 35th Street. The next meeting will be on Dec. 1.
