Just as students have left campus, the Office of Facilities has revved up for the summer.
In addition to relocating the School of Continuing Studies downtown and beginning construction on the Healey Family Student Center, Facilities will undertake 12 construction and renovation projects this summer in locations including the Magis Row townhouses, Dahlgren Chapel, the Calcagnini Contemplative Center in Clarke County, Va. and an art studio in the Edmund A. Walsh Building.
“Generally during the summer we have a higher percentage of projects that people want to do that can only be done in the summer when either the faculty is not at their peak or the students are not here,” Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said.
The Calcagnini Contemplative Center has been under construction in the Blue Ridge Mountains since fall 2011 and is set to be completed over the summer. The center is a gift from the Calcagnini family, who also fully endowed the ESCAPE First Year Experience in 1991.
The new complex will be used for Campus Ministry retreats, including ESCAPE, starting this fall.
“[The center] expands the footprint of Georgetown geographically by 55 acres, and I think it just opens a new chapter for Georgetown in terms of our retreats program, really extending our sense of community beyond the hilltop here,” ESCAPE Program Director Bridget Sherry said.
The center will also provide Georgetown programs with more flexibility, as the retreats will now take place at a Georgetown-owned location rather than the Shepherd’s Spring Outdoor Ministry Center in Sharpsburg, Md., where ESCAPE currently take place.
“When we were [at Shepherd’s Spring] for [ESCAPE leader] training we had to share the center with a group of 50-year-old women who were there to do crafts and puzzles,” Livia Matteucci (COL ’16) said. “It gets annoying sometimes because we don’t always have access to the lodge, whereas with the new center, we’ll be given primary access to it.”
ESCAPE has booked Shepherd’s Spring for all retreats next fall in the case of a construction delay.
The facilities department will also convert a lecture classroom on the third floor of Walsh to a drawing studio for the art department. A laboratory in Walsh will be converted into a lecture classroom to compensate for the lost space. David Hidalgo (COL ’74, MED ’78), a plastic surgeon, is funding the studio renovations.
Currently, the art department occupies the first and second floors of Walsh, which art professors say is not enough to accommodate the 350 to 500 students in studio classes each semester.
“We’re pressed for space, which often creates a situation where multiple disciplines within the arts are sharing the space, … and it makes it difficult to offer more courses to students but also to just smoothly run the art classes,” Art Department Chair John Morrell said.
“Being able to have a larger room with a set-up that’s appropriate for drawing only where there’s space for still-life objects, model stands, things like that, will make it a more useful space for drawing teachers,” Gallery Director Evan Reed, who has taught both drawing and design, said. “It will be a nicer space all around, and it will also free up space down below for more studio room for 3-D.”
The exterior renovations of Dahlgren Chapel will be completed early this summer, at which point interior renovations will begin. Renovations of the interior, which involve replacing half of the existing floor, basic refurbishing and installation of new seating, will be completed by the fall, according to Director of Liturgy and Music James Wickman. A new organ will be installed in January 2014.
“[The renovation] is going to take the beautiful liturgies that we already have and enhance them even more and make participation better and make people’s prayer experiences better,” Wickman said.
Dahlgren Chapel will be closed for part of the summer during construction. Sunday Mass and weekend services will be held in St. William’s Chapel between June 21 and Aug. 25, while weekday Mass will be held in Copley Crypt Chapel between June 3 and Sept. 6.
The construction projects will not significantly impact campus activity this summer, according to Morey.
“There are going to be impacts, but I would say, by and large, it’s going to be transparent to most people,” he said.
Facilities projects will also include repurposing 18 Magis Row Townhouses as faculty housing and administrative space in accordance with the 2010 Campus Plan, replacing the roof on McDonough Gymnasium, converting a computer lab in St. Mary’s hall into faculty offices and renovating three classrooms in White Gravenor.

Georgetown’s Heyden Observatory lost out on a $100,000 grant from Partners in Preservation after a three-week campaign by Georgetown College to encourage support for the site. The observatory did, however, receive $10,000 for participating in the contest that lasted from April 24 to May 10.
The Washington Cathedral earned the most points through online voting and social media to win the full $100,000, which will be used to repair nave vaulting.
An advisory committee from Partners in Preservation — a partnership between the National Trust for Historic Preservation and American Express — allocated a further $785,000 among 12 sites. The remaining 11 locations, including the Heyden Observatory, received $5,000 each. The observatory received an additional $5,000 for putting together a concerted effort in the Partners in Preservation campaign.
“[The money] isn’t enough to do any major renovation, [but] we were pleased to see how proactive the College was in pushing this,” Georgetown University Astronomical Society Vice President Daniel Dylewsky (COL ’15) said. “Now, [the observatory] is a higher priority.”
The Heyden Observatory was one of 24 finalists in the contest, chosen through two application processes from 200 government- or nonprofit-owned sites identified by the National Trust in need of repair that could be completed within 14 months. Washington, D.C., was the eighth city to play host to the competition.
The College submitted the applications and organized the campaign materials, including a short film depicting a couple’s romantic night at the observatory.
“Georgetown College, which used to host the department of astronomy, took the lead on the project since Heyden Observatory was primarily used by that department,” Arts and Sciences Communication Officer Maggie Moore said.
The College sought funds to restore the observatory exterior, which is currently covered in lead paint, but the Astronomical Society is pushing for further renovations.
“There’s a variety of things that need to be done … to restore it to its peak condition, when it was used for astronomy,” Dylewski said. “That means, first of all, repairing or replacing the dome, which is falling apart.”
He also hopes to replace the telescope steering system, which is currently motorized, with parts to evoke the historic analog system.
The observatory is now used as the host of the entomology and biodiversity laboratory and Astronomical Society meetings. The site was completed in 1844, making it the third oldest observatory in the country. In 1846, the observatory was used to determine the geographical coordinates of Washington. Light pollution currently inhibits its further use in astronomy.
“When it was used as an observatory, it was part of some important scientific discoveries,” National Trust’s southern field office Director Rob Nieweg said to The Hoya. “It is also connected to the contemporary campus. … The National Trust for Historic Preservation, we evaluate the past … but also what’s happening today.”
He added that the contest had two goals: to award money for preservation and to increase public support and awareness of preservation projects.
“We were very impressed with the social media response and we know the students love it,” Niewegsaid.
Nieweg suggested that Georgetown and other unsuccessful contest participants continue to highlight the historical sites in need of renovation. The National Trust holds a follow-up workshop for competitors to provide tips on how to capitalize on participation.
“We plan to revisit our plans for the observatory in light of the funding we received and continue to look for opportunities to preserve the observatory and heighten awareness of this historic building,” Moore said.
Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of money the Heyden Observatory was granted in the Partners in Preservation contest. It was $10,000, not $5,000.

Four students who earned the highest GPAs in their respective schools will be honored at graduation ceremonies this weekend.
Steven Waldorf (COL ’13) and Russell Kreutter (MSB ’13) will be named valedictorians and will speak at the Georgetown College and McDonough School of Business, respectively, Tropaia ceremonies Friday. Though the
 
School of Nursing & Health Studies and the School of Foreign Service do not have valedictorians, the NHS Dean’s Medal will be awarded to Lindsey Mahoney (NHS ’13) and the SFS Dean’s Medal will be awarded to Yiting Li (SFS ’13) for having the highest cumulative GPAs in their respective schools.
All four seniors will carry their respective college’s banner at commencement.
Waldorf, who is graduating with a 4.0 GPA, will deliver the Cohonguroton Address at the College’s Tropaia awards ceremony Friday. He said that recently retired professor Fr. James V. Schall, S.J., was one of his great personal and intellectual mentors during his time at Georgetown.
“I am excited about speaking at the same podium in Gaston Hall from which Fr. Schall spoke to give his last lecture,” Waldorf said. “I regard it, first and foremost, as a great blessing of which I am, in a sense, undeserving because the gifts that I have were given to me, and I’m not necessarily deserving of them. I am both honored and deeply humbled to receive this award.”
Waldorf, a government major and theology minor, said he was able to achieve his high grades because of his discipline but said he was also able to find a balance between work and other activities. To focus, Waldorf would turn off his cell phone and music. He said, however, that it was sometimes a challenge to ignore distractions, and that religion also helped him to maintain focus.
“One important strategy, I think, for me as a Catholic, is the idea of offering up work as a sacrifice to God,” he said. “That has a way of, I think, focusing the mind much more.”
Waldorf will be pursuing a master’s degree in theology at the University of Notre Dame after graduation.
Kreutter, a marketing and accounting double major, will speak at the MSB Tropaia Ceremony on Friday morning. He will focus on five major lessons that he learned during his time at Georgetown. He said he was nervous but excited for the speech.
“[I will] try to make it somewhat applicable to other people in the audience but also kind of look forward past Georgetown,” Kreutter said. “I think Georgetown students and high-achieving students in general have a tendency to plan two, three, four, five, 10 years in the future. One of the lessons I’ve learned is that probably the most happy I’ve been at Georgetown have been times when I’ve been able to stay in the moment.”
Kreutter, who is graduating with a 3.979 GPA, expressed appreciation to his professors and peers for their support during the past four years.
He also emphasized that the valedictorian award is based solely on GPA and that work outside the classroom is more important.
“It wasn’t something that I consciously set as a goal. I guess the way I study and the way I work is something inherent within me. One goal was to learn and take advantage of classes,” Kreutter said. “Even if I was told from day one that I wasn’t going to win this award, I would have studied exactly as I did.”
Kreutter received an A- in two courses, “20th Century African Literature” and an advanced Spanish class. He will be working for Monitor-Deloitte consulting group next year.
Mahoney, who is graduating with a 3.96 GPA, said she is honored and did not expect to be named as the NHS student with the highest cumulative GPA.
“I’ve definitely worked really hard throughout my Georgetown career, but it’s an amazing honor. There are so many incredibly smart people in the NHS, and I was actually really surprised when they told me, to be honest,” she said. “It’s really nice to see that a lot of my hard work is paying off.”
Mahoney, a human science major with a certificate in population health, said she would always study ahead of time and was careful with her time management. However, she was not always studying and left time for socializing and extracurricular activities.
Mahoney said she received an A- in four courses: physics, organic chemistry lab, Spanish and theology.
Since the NHS does not officially name a valedictorian, Mahoney will not give a speech at an awards ceremony.
“Honestly, I think that it is great to be recognized and everything and this is a really big honor for me to get this award, but at the same time, there are so many incredibly talented people in the NHS, in all the schools really,” she said. “I don’t necessarily think that putting me on some sort of pedestal is necessary.”
Mahoney will be a research assistant at Children’s Hospital in Boston and will apply to medical schools next year.
Li, who has earned the highest GPA in the SFS and majored in international economics, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The university is looking at several options for graduate student housing, potentially for fall 2013.
Georgetown does not currently provide housing for graduate students. In November 2012, however, the university issued a request for information on metro-area options.
The Washington Business Journal reported that the JBGCompanies’ Slate apartment building in Rosslyn is being considered. The building, located at 1530 Clarendon Blvd., is currently under construction and contains 203 units. That location, a 10-minute drive from the university, is also near the Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle stop near the Rosslyn metro station.
JBG Senior Vice President Matthew Blocher and university Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey both declined to comment on any possibility of partnership.
According to Morey, the committee is looking into five or six locations in Rosslyn, Arlington and Washington, D.C., all of which would be leased rather than purchased. These locations were all chosen due to their Metro access and relative proximity to the university. The university will provide a shuttle system to whichever location is chosen.
“Really, it’s proximity, and then secondary is what we can charge for it,” Morey said.
Morey declined to comment on pricing for graduate students, adding that it would be dependent on the price of the lease.
Graduate student housing would likely follow the same guidelines and restrictions governing undergraduate student housing, requiring students of the same gender to live together. Provisions would be made for married couples, while unmarried couples would likely not be permitted to live together, according to Graduate Student Organization President Paul Musgrave (GRD ’16). There is uncertainty about how university policy would treat same-sex marriages or civil unions not recognized by the Catholic Church or if same-sex couples would have access to housing benefits provided to other married couples. Musgrave said he would support equal treatment.
These discussions coincide with undergraduate discussion of gender-neutral housing on campus, an issue highlighted by Georgetown University Student Association President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) during his campaign.
Musgrave emphasized the importance of housing options to the graduate student community.
“We’ve been advocating for this for a long time. Lacking graduate student housing has put Georgetown at a disadvantage,” Musgrave said. “Especially for people moving in from far away, the D.C. real estate market is really tough to navigate for an outsider. Having housing available is an amenity that many students look for.”
The Office of Student Affairs has solicited graduate student input through a survey covering amenities, price range and housing options, while the university has also utilized graduate student focus groups for input.
“Our goal is to provide housing that meets our students’ needs and further supports their learning experience while enrolled at Georgetown,” university spokeswoman Rachel Pugh said.
Musgrave said that the university asked graduate students about preferences between dormitories and apartments, studio apartments and multi-bedroom apartments, and price points and provisions for married students. The question of gender-neutral housing was not addressed.
Graduate students prioritized differentiating between the housing needs of undergraduates and graduate students in these discussions, pushing for apartment-style housing over shared townhouses or higher-quality dorms.
“There’s a difference from being 18 to 19 and being told that you’re living [in poor conditions] for a year or being 25 or 30 and trying to find the sort of housing that’s appropriate to your needs,” Musgrave said. “Having access to safe, reliable housing is a high priority for many young adults in the D.C. area.”

There was a slight uptick in the admissions yield this year, with 47.4 percent of accepted students in the Class of 2017 enrolling at Georgetown compared to last year’s rate of 47 percent.
Of the 3,293 students admitted in early action and regular decision, 1,561 submitted deposits by the May 1 deadline, according to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon.
“This year has been, by the numbers, the best,” Deacon said. “The yield is about the same, but we won more of our top students. We know that by the way we code them in the system.”
The yield for Georgetown College was 43.5 percent, while the School of Foreign Service had a yield of 47.2 percent. The McDonough School of Business and the School of Nursing and Health Studies had higher yields of 53.6 percent and 53 percent, respectively.
The MSB, which had the highest yield, had a 15.7 percent acceptance rate this year, the lowest among the schools for the first time.
According to Deacon, students from 70 countries and all 50 states have submitted deposits. More than 1,000 high schools are represented.
The enrolling class is the first in university history to have an average score above 700 in both the SAT critical reading and math sections.
According to Deacon, the university usually aims for a 45 to 47 percent yield, putting this year at the higher end of the range.
“We’re pretty much right where we want to be,” Deacon said. “But that will change as people get off on other waiting lists and as we take some students off of our waiting list.”
Although the university is still waiting on late deposit slips, 50 students have already been accepted from the waitlist. Deacon expects about 45 of those students to submit deposits.
While this would bring the number of deposited students over the goal class size of 1,580 students, Deacon said the waitlist acceptances would account for attrition over the summer.
“How many withdraw is hard to predict,” Deacon said. “It depends on how many waitlisted students get off at the other top schools or how many people might defer for a gap year.”
According to Deacon, approximately 40 students withdraw each year, while about 25 students decide to take a gap year.
Georgetown and Ivy League schools all stop waitlist acceptances on June 30, at which point the university must estimate how much attrition will occur in July and August. Furthermore, while many other universities can accommodate over-enrollment, Georgetown must stay below 1,580 students to comply with the component of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement that caps total enrollment of undergraduate and graduate students on the main campus.
“We won’t go over, and we will hopefully fill up close to the real number,” Deacon said. “The waitlist numbers will pretty much offset the people who withdraw.”
There are 100 students still on the waitlist, down from the 2,000 originally waitlisted. Deacon said as many as 25 people may receive acceptances in the coming weeks.
“It’s a domino effect. It starts at the top,” Deacon said. “If Harvard takes somebody, Yale loses somebody, then Yale takes from another school. Fortunately, we’re high enough on the chain that we don’t lose that many.”
Deacon attributed the higher yield rate for the MSB and the NHS to the two schools’ specializations.
“Those are the schools that directly seem to confer jobs at the end,” Deacon said. “The yield has been higher for the last seven years for those schools.”
Although the SFS has a similar benefit, Deacon attributed its comparatively low yield to its competition with other top schools.
“It’s surprising that the SFS’ rate is under 50 percent,” Deacon said. “It reflects where we’re losing them to. There’s a higher rate of crossover between accepted students there and other top schools. They’re in more direct competition.”
Deacon stressed the importance of refraining from excessive comparisons with other universities.
“Yield is an elusive number. If we were like a lot of places with early decision where yield is 100 percent, our yield rate would be in the 60s,” Deacon said, referring to other schools’ binding admissions policies. “We choose early action in the students’ interest really, and we’re really looking to compare our numbers to our numbers, and not to others’ numbers.”
Overall, Deacon expressed satisfaction with the outcome of this year’s admissions process.
“We met all of our goals,” Deacon said. “We purposefully kept our early admissions rate low so we could look at the diverse pool of regular decision candidates.”

Georgetown University Law Center professor Howard Shelanski was named President Barack Obama’s nominee to head the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the nation’s chief regulation review body, April 25.
Shelanski, currently on leave from Georgetown and serving as the director of the Bureau of Economics at the Federal Trade Commission, must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. As of press time, no date had yet been set for Shelanski’s confirmation hearing.
“Our nation will be greatly served by the talent and expertise these individuals bring to their new roles,” Obama said in a White House press release announcing Shelanski’s nomination, which was part of a batch of nominations. “I am grateful they have agreed to serve in this administration and I look forward to working with them in the months and years ahead.”
OIRA, an agency within the Office of Management and Budget in the Executive Office of the President, is responsible for vetting all government regulations and provides feedback on a host of different policies ranging from transportation to healthcare.
“OIRA’s mission is to make sure regulations are not overreaching or fail tests of economic rationality,” Law Center professor Steven Salop said. “It helps the executive branch remain up to date in the best thinking about how to formulate good regulations.”
According to Salop, regulation is a combination of law and economics, and Shelanski’s experience within both fields as a law professor, chief economist for the Federal Communications Commission and a senior economist on the President’s Council on Economic Advisers makes him an ideal candidate for the position.
“I can’t imagine someone who is better qualified for the job,” Salop said. “It does not surprise me that the president would want someone like Shelanski for this job.”
Salop noted that Shelanski appeals across party lines as Obama’s nominee and a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonio Scalia (CAS ’57).
“He sees both sides,” Salop said. “He is cautious, rigorous and progressive. … He is a person who can communicate cogently to people across the political spectrum and be considered reasonable by everyone.”
Economics professor Robert Cumby, however, said that other political factors could potentially stand in the way of the confirmation process.
“It can have absolutely nothing to do with whether he’s the guy or not,” Cumby said. “These things can be slowed up for reasons that have nothing to do with the nominee. It all depends on what other issues are on people’s minds and whether there’s been a negotiation with a package of appointments that it will be considered and moved ahead speedily.”
If confirmed, Shelanski would succeed Cass Sunstein, who stepped down in August 2012.
