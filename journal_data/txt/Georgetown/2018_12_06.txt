Policymakers must ensure their efforts to combat human trafficking prioritize victims of both sex and labor trafficking, School of Foreign Service centennial fellow Ambassador Mark Lagon said at an event in the Old North Building on Monday.
Sex trafficking and labor trafficking are two equally important subcategories within human trafficking; however, large companies may neglect to take measures to address the issue of labor trafficking as comprehensively, Lagon said at an event hosted by Georgetown University College Republicans. 
“Moving forward, there will be a rebalancing so that sex traffic is not marginalized, but one also hopes that the labor issue is not de-prioritized because it is found less attractive, or frankly that the business community finds complicated to deal with and its supply chains,” Lagon said.
Lagon, who served as the ambassador-at-large to monitor and combat trafficking in persons under former President George W. Bush, is currently the CEO of the Polaris Group, a Washington, D.C.-based nongovernmental organization focused on the eradication of global slavery.
In 2016, approximately 24.9 million people were victims of forced labor, according to the International Labor Organization. In 2000, the United States passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, a comprehensive federal law that seeks to prevent trafficking, protect victims and prosecute perpetrators. Yet tension between prevention of both categories of trafficking still characterizes current efforts to end human trafficking, according to Lagon.
“The emphasis early on was on sex trafficking,” Lagon said. “My predecessor really hammered the issue through and made it a frontline issue, but truth be told, at least a majority of the number of the victims are focused on labor rather than on sex workers.” 
Though Lagon spent his time as ambassador-at-large focusing on preventing labor trafficking, the balance between the two sides of human trafficking has shifted during the tenures of different administrations.
“Often there is heavy emphasis on sex trafficking, with many not wanting to go near the issue of labor trafficking per se,” Lagon said. “So as the Trump administration came in, there’s an expectation that there will again be rebalancing of the two issues, and my hope is that there will be a balance between the two issues.”
President Donald Trump and his administration have taken serious measures to combat human trafficking, Lagon said. Trump issued an executive order in December 2017 sanctioning individuals connected to human rights abuses and signed a bill into law in April 2018 making websites liable for any human trafficking that occurs through their platforms. 
The American Bar Association has written on the ways that the Trump administration’s immigration policies may actually reduce the protections available for victims of human trafficking.
Victims of human trafficking who are without documentation may not seek legal recourse because of their status, yet victims with documentation warrant just as much protection, according to Lagon. 
“There is a certain category of undocumented migrants who isn’t at fault, who were lied to, who was so brutally exploited that they deserve to be treated as a victim of human trafficking and be protected,” Lagon said.
The illegal movement of people is not the most significant aspect of human trafficking despite what the name may suggest, Lagon said.
“It is the exploitation and not the movement that is the distinctive thing, and that is why Republicans and Democrats alike have referred to this as modern slavery,” Lagon said. 
The United States pressures countries that face a large number of sex trafficking cases to change their policies using a rating system that gives countries a rating of one to four based on whether they meet the Trafficking Victims Protection Act’s requirements for trafficking prevention, according to Lagon. 
The instability and desire for improved quality of life are major factors that put individuals at risk of human trafficking, Lagon said.
“Where there is conflict and chaos, there is a danger of people being exploited,” Lagon said. “Parents will be told that their children will have a better life if they’re moved to a different place.”

The number of children without health insurance in the United States rose for the first time in at least a decade, according to a report by the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families released Nov. 21.
The study estimated that the number of children without insurance in the United States rose by 276,000 in 2017, bringing the total number to 3.9 million. The number of uninsured children rose for the first time since 2008 last year, according to the report, which analyzes data the U.S. Census Bureau releases annually.
The report found that three-quarters of children who lost coverage live in states that did not expand Medicaid services available under the Affordable Care Act, a policy signed by former President Barack Obama in 2010 that expanded Medicaid eligibility and offered cost assistance for the uninsured through health insurance marketplaces.
The report found that the number of uninsured children rose in all 50 states because of loss in coverage or possible decreases in signups. Washington, D.C., saw the only increase in children with health insurance in 2017, after the number decreased in 2016. The percentage of children without health insurance in D.C. decreased from 3.1 percent to 1.2 percent. In a list of all 50 states and D.C., the city jumped from 13th to first in the number of children with insurance.
The discrepancy between the growing U.S. economy and the increase in number of uninsured children is concerning, said Olivia Pham, CCF research associate and co-author of the study.
“I think that it is really alarming, especially when we’re in a time when we have a strong economy,” Pham said. “Why are we seeing this increase in uninsured kids?”
The report suggests recent federal policy changes may have influenced the uptick in uninsured children. While the majority of children from low-income families are eligible for Medicaid or the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program, doubt regarding the programs’ futures may discourage enrollment, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank in D.C.
Congress did not fully fund CHIP for over three months in 2017, prompting some states to freeze enrollment in the program.
Additional efforts in 2017 to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its individual mandate, which required almost all U.S. citizens and permanent residents to have health insurance, could have also affected the number of families with health insurance, the study says.
The report found one in four uninsured children has at least one parent with immigrant status. The rhetoric of President Donald Trump’s administration on immigration policy also may have contributed to fewer sign-ups, according to Pham.
In September, the White House proposed adding Medicaid to a list of public services that could prevent legal immigrants from receiving green cards if they had applied for public assistance.
“That kind of policy takes away the welcome mat from Medicaid and CHIP,” Pham said. “It has the potential to discourage families from applying for coverage and may give them fear about applying for Medicaid and CHIP when it could endanger other members of the family or their status.”
The report also documented a pattern of uninsured children in states with high percentages of Native American and Alaskan Native populations. Indian Health Services, a division within the Department of Health and Human Services, provides health programs to Native Americans in the continental United States and Alaska.
However, these populations still have high levels of uninsured children because the IHS does not provide insurance coverage, Pham said.
“The IHS is a provider of health services, but they are not a source of health coverage,” Pham said. “That is still important, because there are not IHS facilities everywhere, and kids can’t always access an IHS immediately when they need care.”
The study found Texas had the most uninsured children in the country in 2017, while South Dakota witnessed the largest increase in uninsured children from 2016 to 2017. Both states are among the 14 that have not authorized an expansion of Medicaid for low-income families.
In order to limit the increase of uninsured children, policy changes must be implemented, Pham said.
“I think the big concern with this report is that this upward trend in uninsured children continues,” Pham said. “If there are not changes in policy, if people don’t feel like it’s safe to access services, we’re going to see more and more children uninsured.”

Former Supervisory Investigator at the Washington, D.C. Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration Shawn Townsend is set to become the inaugural director of the Office of Nightlife and Culture later this month.
Townsend’s appointment ended a job search that saw a record number of applications for a mayoral cabinet position in the District, according to The Washington Post.
Under Townsend’s leadership, the new office, which Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) signed into legislation in October, will act as the intermediary between residents and D.C. businesses that operate between 5 p.m. and 2 a.m.
Bowser anticipates the office to start running mid-December, according to associate press secretary Zachary Leibell.
D.C. Councilmember Brandon Todd (D-Ward 4) expressed his support for Townsend because of his former experience serving in D.C.’s public sector and working with nightlife venues.
“With Shawn Townsend, Mayor Bowser has found an individual with the experience and perspective necessary to lead the mayor’s Office of Nightlife and Culture in pursuing this important mission,” Todd said in a Nov. 28 news release.
Todd introduced legislation establishing the Office of Nightlife and Culture in 2017 with the expressed purpose of balancing the growth of the city’s nightlife industry with the needs of residents affected by the opening of new bars and clubs in their neighborhoods.
The full-time position was listed on Bowser’s Office of Talent and Appointments website as an Expected Service Grade 8 public sector job, which will entitle Townsend to a $97,434 to $118,000 yearly salary, according to DCist.
During his time at the ABRA, Townsend managed the issue and renewal of liquor licenses and the investigation of potential violations of liquor law. Before joining ABRA in 2014, he worked at D.C.’s Office of Police Complaints and within D.C. Public Schools, beginning in 2009.
Before working in the public sector, Townsend opened and managed a bar in Charleston, S.C., according to the news release.
Townsend is set to conduct quarterly meetings with a 15-member Commission of Nightlife, which will include voices from business and residential and government interests, according to the Nov. 28 news release. The office will also include five volunteers who will work under Townsend.
The National Restaurant Association reports that there are 2,267 bars and restaurants in the District, bringing in $3.8 billion in sales and employing 68,900 people. Townsend’s office will be responsible for resolving issues related to the expansion of the District’s growing nightlife industry, according to Todd.
“This new office will help ensure that all stakeholders are working together to address concerns such as parking, noise and litter, and that new and existing establishments have help cutting red tape as they seek to expand opportunities in neighborhoods across the District,” Todd said in the Nov. 28 news release.
The office will be central to maximizing the nightlife experience for both D.C. residents and visitors, Bowser said.
“The Office of Nightlife and Culture is going to ensure that we’re working across D.C. government, with our residents and businesses, to ensure a vibrant D.C. nightlife that works for everyone,” Bowser said in the Nov. 28 news release.
Bowser expressed hope that the office will allow the District to promote equitable growth in its nightlife economy.
“Together, we’re going to work with the community to overcome challenges, create new opportunities for Washingtonians and spread prosperity across all eight wards,” Bowser said.
