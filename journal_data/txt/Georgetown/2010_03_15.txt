A burglary and an attempted burglary in the 1200 block of 37th Street were reported to the Department of Public Safety this morning, according to a public safety alert sent to the university community this afternoon.
In a report of the burglary that was issued at 11:15 a.m., the resident said he found the first floor of his university-owned townhouse house ravaged. Nothing of value was stolen from the resident, who is not a student, according to DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith.
The attempted burglary was reported to DPS in the same approximate location at about 6:30 a.m. A student in the home awoke to an unknown male attempting to gain entry through a back door. The student turned on the light at her porch, and the suspect fled through the backyard.
The suspect in the attempted burglary was described as a tall man in a white shirt.
There were no physical injuries sustained.
PD responded to both crimes and is continuing its investigation of the incidents.
When asked for comment, Smith said DPS had no update but hoped to gather more information.
