The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS) has launched Onward for Afghan Women, which will provide Afghans in exile with a network of resources and opportunities. The program was launched earlier this month. 
Spearheaded by GWIPS Executive Director Melanne Verveer, the initiative draws upon years of partnerships with Afghan leaders, journalists, NGO heads, parliamentarians and activists, many of whom are under active threat from the Taliban, ranking high on their kill list. The initiative is centered around supporting Afghan women leaders in their advocacy efforts on the behalf of women and girls in Afghanistan. 
Verveer said the initiative supports women in Afghanistan after the fall of the government to the Taliban last August.  
“They have either arrived halfway towards their final destinations, or they are in their final destinations, until pray to God, they get to go back to their country one day,” Verveer said in an interview with The Hoya. “But right now that seems far off. And so Onward for Afghan Women is a way in which we can continue to support them, so that they can be contributing in all the ways that they would like to the future of Afghanistan.”
Project Onward is committed to promoting the education of its hundreds of female members, according to Verveer  
“We have enabled many of them to get to other colleges and universities complementary with their skill sets so that they can have gainful employment that is commensurate with their skills, their experience and their education,” Verveer said. 
Roya Rahmani, a former diplomat and Afghanistan’s first female ambassador to the United States, is one of the initiative partners living in Washington, D.C. She works at the Walsh School of Foreign Service where she is an expert on issues of foreign policy, security and women’s rights. 
Rahmani joined GIWPS as a distinguished fellow in July 2021, shortly after completing her mandate as ambassador and just weeks before the Taliban took Kabul in August 2021.  She is pursuing her own research on the application and history of Islam and Sharia law, Rahmani said.  
Project Onward increased awareness about the complex challenges facing people in Afghanistan today, through a series of public events led by Afghan experts, according to Rahmahi.  
“These are very deep and important lessons for students in Georgetown and around the country, for those who will be leaders and policymakers in the future,’’ Rahmahi said. ‘‘There is always room for students to come forward. And if they want to discuss their interest, to take on roles and support, be part of research, be part of developing different initiatives, they have the opportunity to learn hands on some of the challenges that we discuss.’’
The panels are meant to help students better understand the perspectives of Afghan women who have worked in advocacy for years, according to Rahmahi. 
The panels reached thousands of people in over 100 countries, covering policy, the future of female education under Talibal rule, the rapidly growing humanitarian crisis in the country and what peace talks and negotiations should look like, Rahmahi said. 
Onward for Afghan Women supports Afghan women leaders who have already done advocacy work in support of women and girls in Afghanistan through engaging with GWIPS to conduct research, host global convenings and support the future generation of leaders. 
Allie Smith, director at Onward for Afghan Women, said that although Afghanistan now finds itself in a dark place, a hopeful future is possible. 
“To evacuate them from their home country, and to have them into the United States is heartbreaking,” Smith said in an interview with The Hoya. “To be able to facilitate opportunities for these women to continue to be the leaders that they are and to continue to contribute to peace and security and equality for Afghanistan, for the women and girls that were made in Afghanistan, is a privilege.”
Rahmani said she hopes the resettlement of experts abroad will sustain their work for the reconstruction of Afghanistan. 
“And then also to think of how to help them resettle, how to help them continue their work, how to make sure that the connection to the ground is not lost,” Rahmani said, “And how to continue the advocacy so that as soon as a new issue comes up and absorbs the entire attention of the international community, the Afghan women would not be forgotten.”

Georgetown University announced plans to raise its undergraduate tuition by 3.5%, increasing the cost from $59,784 to $61,872 for the 2022-23 academic year.
The university notified students about the annual tuition increase in a Feb. 14 email from Provost Robert Groves. In accordance with the higher tuition cost, the total cost of attendance will increase by approximately 3.3%, citing inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and providing more resources for academics and student programs as the reason for the increase. 
The tuition increase was unnecessary, and the university should look toward alternative means of funding its operations, according to Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate Speaker Leo Rassieur (COL ’22).
“I understand that the university is going through some hard times financially and that inflation has impacted everyone in this country,” Rassieur said in an interview with The Hoya. “But I also know that the university’s top executives are paid obscenely large amounts of money and that the university is looking for ways to cover those costs. Maybe they should start looking at the salary of their top executives, not at the pockets of low-income students who are already struggling to pay tuition.”
The tuition increase will hurt low-income students, especially those who rely on external scholarships — for which the university only takes off $3,000 maximum from a student’s family contribution — to help cover the cost of tuition, according to GUSA President Nile Blass (COL ’22).
“It’s going to negatively impact a lot of students who have outside scholarships because of the way Georgetown calculates aid,” Blass said in an interview with The Hoya. “This just seems like creating a bigger chasm between how students, especially those with aid, are going to be able to meaningfully support themselves and to maintain some level of stability in the academic environment.”
The university aims to minimize the amount by which tuition increases every year, while taking into account economic conditions that impact the school’s finances, according to a university spokesperson.
“Difficult decisions have to be made with regard to providing for our students, updating infrastructure, improving teaching practices and meeting growing student services-based needs,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Balancing these competing demands is an ongoing process and includes consideration of the rising costs of providing services and attracting strong faculty.”
For the 2021-22 academic year, the total cost of attendance increased by 4% from the previous year, while tuition increased by 3.5% for the 2020-21 academic year. 
The projected distribution of undergraduate expenses for fiscal year 2023 includes 30% of tuition dollars allocated to instruction and 21% of tuition dollars allocated to financial aid, according to the Feb. 14 email.
GUSA will meet with various university organizations, like the Georgetown Scholars Program (GSP), which provides support for first-generation and low-income (FGLI) students at Georgetown, to gain a better understanding of how the tuition increase will affect different communities before meeting with the administration, according to Blass.
During the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters, which took place online, the university instituted a 10% tuition discount for all undergraduate students. Despite beginning the spring 2022 semester virtually, students were not given a discount. 
The university currently has no plans for offering tuition refunds for the spring 2022 semester, according to Rassieur, but will reconsider if the university goes back to virtual learning. 
The tuition increase announcement itself is a significant source of stress for the student body, Rassieur said. 
“It’s really worrying to me,” Rassieur said. “I know a lot of students who saw that announcement and are already having very tense conversations with their family, their parents to see how we’re going to be able to adjust to this and how this is going to impact us.”

The Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative welcomed three new entrepreneurs-in-residence (EIRs) to its industry mentorship program as part of its twelfth cohort. 
The Entrepreneurship Initiative at the McDonough School of Business (MSB) provides students with opportunities to learn about entrepreneurship and apply those skills through pitch competitions and events with distinguished visiting speakers. The new EIRs are Karima Ladhani, David Goldberg (GRD ’94) and Nkechi “Payton” Iheme, all of whom will advise and mentor students, alumni, faculty and administrators in the Georgetown community.  
The EIRs’ diverse expertise is a valuable resource to the Georgetown community, according to David Lange, the initiative’s program manager. 
“We have assembled a team of incredible entrepreneurs from a wide variety of backgrounds and industry experiences who together have combined experience of hundreds of years spanning everything from health to tech to finance to real estate to consumer packaged goods,” Lange said in an interview with The Hoya. “They are here to help our students with any questions that they may have.” 
Students can connect with EIRs by attending weekly Chalk Talks or by browsing through entrepreneur biographies and messaging directly through the initiative’s website, Lange said. 
Ladhani is the founder and chief executive officer of Barakat Bundle, a nonprofit that works to provide health and education packages to mothers and newborns in South Asia. Although it primarily partners with communities in India, Barakat Bundle also has a branch called Giving Cradle, which sells cribs in North America to expand the organization’s market. 
Ladhani developed Barakat Bundle when she was a student and encourages students to take advantage of the resources available to them in college. 
“Knowing how to leverage those opportunities is really important, and as an entrepreneur, you don’t know what you don’t know,” Ladhani said in an interview with The Hoya. “As an entrepreneur-in-residence, I hope I can shed some light on those things that students may not even know to ask about or have the foresight to see. Hopefully that can allow them to be even more prepared as they move forward with their ventures or ideas.”
Ladhani’s goal as an EIR is to advise each individual student with entrepreneurship projects that they are passionate about. 
“My role as an entrepreneur-in-residence is in many ways directed by students. I’m here to be able to advise students on thinking through the ideas they may have to solve a particular problem, whether that is creating a startup or facing a community-based challenge,” Ladhani said. “We’re here to be able to provide advice based on our experience.”
Iheme is the head of public policy for North America, Latin America and the Caribbean for Bumble Inc., a social network for dating, looking for friends or growing one’s professional network, and will also serve as a new EIR. 
Goldberg, who has leadership experience in the education, hospitality and franchise industries, recently retired from his position as president, chief executive officer and board member of Cadence Education, the fourth largest provider of early childhood education in the nation. 
The scope and convenience of the EIR program for aspiring entrepreneurs is a testament to Georgetown’s prominence in education, according to Goldberg. 
“In my short time with the program, I have been incredibly impressed with the faculty, the entrepreneurs-in-residence that I have met, and the program itself, which is incredibly well-organized, expansive and accessible,” Goldberg wrote to The Hoya. “This is an incredible resource for students and alumni of smart, experienced, dedicated people who are giving their time and expertise back to the Georgetown community. It’s a great example of what makes Georgetown such a special place.”
Mike Malloy, who is in his seventh year as an EIR, said that EIRs play an important role in assisting students with entrepreneurial research and implementation of ideas. 
“EIRs give students advice on how to navigate the lean startup methodology to bring their ideas to reality,” Malloy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We help students identify hypotheses about the problems they wish to solve, and then encourage them to conduct customer discovery interviews to (in)validate their hypothesis. We also help students pitch and present their ideas.”
Goldberg aspires to support students as they realize the potential of a variety of entrepreneurial opportunities. 
“The most important skill for young people to develop is the skill in being able to ‘figure it out’, which means finding a way to solve a problem or take advantage of an opportunity – through research, seeing advice from the right people, trial and error, or just being persistent,” Goldberg wrote in an email to The Hoya.
