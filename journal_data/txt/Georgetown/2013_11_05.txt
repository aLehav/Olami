Actor Kevin Spacey and Ron Klain (CAS ’83), former chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden, roused a packed Gaston Hall on Monday evening in a discussion about ethics in politics.
Most of the event, in which Klain, currently an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, asked Spacey questions about his career and personal views, centered on the ethical commentary in Spacey’s TV show “House of Cards.” The Netflix series, which stars Spacey, is the work for which he is most famous.
Spacey amused the audience by appearing in a Georgetown crewneck sweater, cursing unsparingly and demanding a Starbucks coffee from an aide in the middle of the event, alluding to his pompous “House of Cards” character, Frank Underwood. He said that the show, which depicts American politics as ruthless and ethically shady, carries special relevance at a time when the United States is enduring what he called “one of the most paralyzed governments” in years.
“There are … politicians who were viewed as ruthless, very difficult, in your face and [who] would do dirty, dirty nasty things, who are being re-examined. Lyndon B. Johnson is being reexamined as a politician. A lot of people thought he was the toughest son of a b – – – – in the world, but he got three civil rights bills passed,” Spacey said.
Spacey drew on his experience filming “Recount,” a 2008 political drama in which he played Klain, to affirm that the macabre portrayal of American politics in “House of Cards” is accurate.“The s – – – that went down in that experience was some of the most extraordinary mind-boggling manipulation. I watch what’s going on in Washington and I think to myself, ‘our scripts aren’t that f – – – – ing crazy,’” Spacey said.
To provide an example, Spacey argued that the ambiguity surrounding the validity of promises in the series is reflective of their impotence in today’s political climate.
“We’ve just been through a situation that began, or was at least spearheaded by, a promise that was made and couldn’t be delivered on: Boehner saying it was, ‘Yes, we have a deal, Oh, I can’t deliver on the deal, Oh, let’s shut down the government.’ We do seem to be existing in a time where that is happening. Welcome to the world of human contradiction,” he said.
Despite these grim realities, Spacey reminded the audience that effective public service has the potential to make seismic progress.
“I believe in public service, and I think it’s an extraordinary thing when people decide they want to become involved in their communities or state or country … and help those who are in a more difficult situation. A lot of [politics] turns people off … but there are a lot of incredible things that can be done,” he said.
Klain drew on his lengthy career in government to argue that ethics still have a prominent place in U.S. politics.
“I understand why there are political figures who disappoint and disenchant us,” Klain said, “But I believe people on both sides are in politics for the right reasons and do things in an ethical way every day.”
Spacey agreed, suggesting that to deem a politician either unethical or ethical is too simplistic.“Life is not black and white, and sometimes it is very easy for us to say, ‘This is bad,’ and, ‘This is good,’ whereas we all generally live in a world that’s a little more gray. It’s the gray that’s interesting — where we find common ground,” he said.
The event’s lengthy question-and-answer period allowed the audience to ask Spacey and Klain about modern politics and aspects of their careers. Notably, Spacey lamented the way in which the 1980s decision of media organizations to prioritize profitability has compromised the integrity of modern news outlets.
“When you make it have to be profitable, it can no longer be news. When it competes against entertainment, it’s entertainment,” he said. “People tune into a channel to hear their own opinions voiced back to them again and again.”
In counterpoint, Klain argued that the rise of social media has played a pivotal role in democratizing news. He recounted that once the “Twittersphere” affirmed that President Obama performed poorly in the 2012 presidential debate in Denver, Obama’s team of “news spinners” were left powerless to influence popular opinion.
“People in your generation have the power to shape the news,” he told the audience, earning loud applause.
The most thunderous applause, however, was in response to a student’s question to Spacey about the likelihood of a female president being elected in coming races.
“If Congress isn’t ready, they better f – – – ing get ready,” Spacey said.

While construction on the Healey Family Student Center continues, the Center for Student Engagement is establishing a planning and advisory committee to facilitate student input.
The committee will consist of appointed administrators as well as students who will represent both individual organizations and the student body as a whole.
“It’s going to be a combination of students appointed through their group area and through an open application process,” Director of Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr said. “My vision was that it would be a combined group of students reflecting both specific perspectives and general interests.”
Cohen Derr expects the committee to begin meeting in November, with committee members helping to screen potential staff members for the center.
“They’ll be involved in all aspects of planning the program launch of the space. Part of this will be the search for the full-time program director and full-time director of the HFSC and will include resume screening [and] interviews,” Cohen Derr said. “They’ll help set policies and priorities that’ll maximize student space.”
Additionally, members will provide input to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson on how to use space in the center, including helping to choose furniture and decorations and suggesting areas to be designated free-speech zones.
Students of Georgetown Inc., Interhall Council, the Georgetown Programming Board, the Performing Arts Advisory Council and the Georgetown University Student Association will all have representatives on the committee. Students not affiliated with campus groups were also invited to apply.
“I think the idea behind that is to make sure that stakeholders have representation,” GUSA Director of Student Space Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) said. “They’re really keeping it a student-focused space and helping to plan some of the policies and organizing the launch to really help get that space fully operational.”
Many dance and performing arts groups were displaced by HFSC construction. PAAC Chair T. Chase Meachum (COL ’14) expressed appreciation that his group is represented on the planning committee.
“It’s a terrific gesture that the performing arts have been asked to put forward an appointee onto this body,” Meachum wrote in an email. “Though the Department of the Performing Arts has done a tremendous amount of planning and coordination to try and mitigate as much as possible the strain on these groups, it has certainly been tough.”

The D.C. Council heard Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie’s (D-Ward 5) campaign-finance reform bill, a legislation package to close loopholes and increase transparency nearly two years in the making in response to several high-profile corruption cases, last week.
The bill would close the LLC loophole, which allows certain business owners to contribute more money to campaigns by donating through multiple corporations. It would also increase transparency in donation-bundling, through which individuals collect contributions from their personal or professional networks, according to The Washington Post.
“There have been certain issues in the District’s campaign finance system that are long overdue for legislative attention,” McDuffie told The Hoya. “I set my sights on these reforms to help restore the public’s trust in District elections.”
However, that trust has been affected by the ongoing federal investigation into Mayor Vincent Gray’s 2010 campaign on corruption charges and the conviction of former Councilmember Harry Thomas Jr. for embezzlement in 2012, which led to his resignation.
McDuffie hopes closing the LLC loophole will level the playing field for businesses and individual donors.
“By closing the loophole, business owners and ordinary campaign contributors will be on relatively equal footing,” McDuffie said. “The LLC issue is really about fairness and combating the appearance that businesses have more weight in the political process than regular people.”
D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson believes the transparency aspect of the bill is critical.
“What is more important is that the public knows who’s contributing,” Mendelson told The Hoya.
However, D.C. mayoral candidate and Councilmember Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) thinks the bill’s reforms should be more restrictive.
“There is no reason any D.C. mayoral candidate should accept a campaign donation that isn’t from an individual,” Wells stated in a press release.
Other councilmembers, including Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3), Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), Vincent Orange (D-Ward 5) and David Catania (I-At Large), agreed that the reform could be stricter. Bowser, for example, expressed concern that the $100 limit the bill establishes for cash and money-order donations is too high.
However, the councilmembers said they would still support the bill at the hearing.
“I’m hopeful that the bill will go through, and at this point, I see no reason why it wouldn’t,” Mendelson said.
But Mendelson maintains that true change in D.C.’s ethically questionable campaign-finance history will come from the voters, not the laws.
“What’s more important is the ethical fiber of the people elected,” Mendelson said. “What’s important is that we not only outlaw bribery, but we also elect people who will not accept bribes.”
“We can’t legislate how people vote,” he added. “But it needs to become a part of the dialogue.”
