As the D.C. Zoning Commission’s June 25 hearing on the 2010 Campus Plan approaches, it appears that the university and neighborhood groups are close to reaching an agreement.
At last night’s monthly Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, the university, the Burleith Citizens Association, the Citizens Association of Georgetown and the local ANC announced that they were requesting a one week extension of the Zoning Commission’s filing deadline to allow the groups to submit a joint proposal.
The approval process for the plan was last extended in early April after the university, the BCA, theCAG and ANC 2E requested a 60-day postponement in order to conduct private talks outside the often combative Zoning Commission hearings.
According to ANC 2E Chair Ron Lewis, the extension will enable participants in the campus plan process to submit a mutually-agreed upon proposal to the Zoning Commission.
“[This extension] could provide sufficient time to finalize an agreement,” he said.
He added that the he believes that the extension is likely to be approved.
Lewis, D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray and Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia will make an announcement regarding the proposal tomorrow afternoon.
According to Lewis, after the proposal is announced a public meeting will be held to allow for community comment and discussion before the proposal is filed with the Zoning Commission.

Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E released the details of Georgetown’s revised 2010 Campus Plan on its website Thursday afternoon, including more information about the proposed Georgetown Community Partnership.
The revisions, which are the result of two months of private negotiations between the university and its neighbors, include commitments from Georgetown to house 90 percent of undergraduates on campus by fall 2025, establish a satellite campus of up to 100 acres and place a renewed emphasis on on-campus student life.
Georgetown also pledged to address neighbors’ quality of life concerns  by setting stricter standards regarding off-campus student behavior and implementing measures to relieve congestion and noise pollution in the neighborhood caused by traffic to and from the university.
The GCP, an element of the revised plan that was announced Wednesday afternoon, will be key to maintaining the accord reached through the private negotiations of the past two months.
According to a joint submission to the D.C. Zoning Commission filed by the university, ANC 2E, theBurleith Citizens Association and the Citizens Association of Georgetown, the GCP will be co-chaired by a member of the university’s senior leadership and a person designated by ANC 2E.
The partnership will have a committee structure to address key issues, with a steering committee composed of representatives from ANCs 2E and 3D, the BCA, CAG, the Foxhall Community Citizens Association and university leadership.
In addition, the university will now fund a consultant, to be selected jointly by Georgetown, the ANCs and neighborhood groups, to analyze and deliver annual reports on the GCP’s progress.
It is not clear from the submission what role students will play in the new partnership.
The submission also includes further details on planned changes to quality of life initiatives, undergraduate and graduate housing and the university’s total enrollment cap.
Chief among these is a new policy eliminating the current registration system for on-campus parties. According to the submission, this will “assure that the environment for students to host social gatherings … is at least as welcoming on campus as off campus.”
In addition, Georgetown will begin implementing measures to shift undergraduate housing back on campus. Magis Row will be moved from 36th to the block of 37th street facing the front gates and townhouses on the 1400 block of 36th street will be repurposed for faculty and staff housing and daytime administrative usage.
The university also agreed to cap its enrollment at 14,106 students, more than 2,000 fewer than the 16,133 proposed when the Campus Plan was originally submitted in December 2010.
The agreement also involved shortening the span of time covered by the Campus Plan. This particular plan will encompass seven years and will expire Dec. 31, 2017. According to a long-term plan posted on the ANC 2E website, the university aims to then extend the timeline of main campus development by designing 20-year, rather than 10-year, plans for expansion.
ANC 2E will hold a public meeting to consider the university’s revisions on June 14.

Walter Rankin, the senior associate dean for academic affairs and compliance, will become the new dean of the School of Continuing Studies on July 1.
Rankin will replace current Dean Robert Manuel, who announced in early April that he would be leaving to become president of the University of Indianapolis.
During his time in the Office of Academic Affairs and Compliance, Rankin was responsible for ensuring that Georgetown met key accreditation standards, including those necessary for membership in the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.
The change was announced in an email sent by University President John J. DeGioia to the Georgetown community Wednesday afternoon.
In his email, DeGioia also announced that current Senior Associate Dean James Parenti will serve as the SCS’s interim chief administrative officer.
“I know Walter and Jim will provide the outstanding leadership during this time of transition for SCS,”DeGioia wrote in his email. “I want to express my sincere appreciation to them for taking on these important responsibilities.”

D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray, University President John J.DeGioia, Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans and ANC 2EChair Ron Lewis formally announced the creation of the Georgetown Community Partnership Wednesday afternoon.
The partnership, which will operate on a committee structure and will include representatives from the university and local neighborhood groups, aims to provide a forum for negotiating and resolving key issues between Georgetown and its neighbors.
This development comes about a year and a half after the first submission of the university’s 2010 Campus Plan, which has been under review by Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E and the D.C. Zoning Commission. The back-and-forth over the campus plan led the D.C. Zoning Commission to charge the university and its neighbors to find a compromise that would benefit the entire community.
“I’m proud today to be here … and be able to say I think we’ve reached an agreement,” Gray said.
DeGioia and Lewis both emphasized that the larger Georgetown community will use the partnership to address all future problems. Lewis also stated that the initiative will address immediate concerns, such as developing a more residential on-campus environment, and longer-term goals, including recognizing the university’s need for growth and creating more satellite campuses.
“This is an extraordinary event in the life of our community, and it is very promising,” he said.
Gray added that the negotiations between the university and community representatives and the resulting partnership can serve as an example to other D.C. universities in their campus plan processes.
“What they have done is develop a prototype,” he said.
The afternoon announcement followed separate emails from DeGioia and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson sent to the university community earlier on Wednesday.
According to Olson, the partnership will balance neighborhood concerns with the needs of the students and Georgetown’s long-term plans for growth. He also wrote that the initiative will help make campus a social hub and provide more late-night dining options, including on-campus food trucks.
“Making our campus a more comfortable and inviting place to live and socialize is a win both for students and for the local community,” he wrote. “This agreement will allow us to provide more opportunities for students to live and socialize on our campus.”
According to Georgetown University Student Association President Clara Gustafson, the partnership can directly benefit students by giving them a voice in further development of the campus.
“Since students weren’t involved in the negotiation process, it’s important that the policies implement a more vibrant, on-campus life,” she told The Hoya.
Jake Sticka (COL ’13), the current student representative on ANC 2E, also expressed concerns about students’ limited role in the negotiations over the 2010 Campus Plan.
“I believe students should have been represented at this table,” Sticka said of the private negotiations that led to Wednesday’s announcement. “Unfortunately, that was not deemed appropriate.”
According to Lewis, ANC 2E will announce more details about the partnership and the date and time of a community meeting tomorrow.
