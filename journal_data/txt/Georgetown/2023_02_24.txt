Former U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation John Sullivan spoke Feb. 21 to Georgetown University students about the ongoing war in Ukraine and Russia’s severed ties with the West. 
The Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies (CERES), a department within the School of Foreign Service (SFS), hosted the event. Sullivan, who represented the United States in Moscow under former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, spoke about the status of the war a year after its start and its global consequences. 
Jill Dougherty, an adjunct professor at CERES who worked as a journalist for over three decades, including as CNN’s bureau chief in Moscow from 1997 to 2005, moderated the discussion.
Dougherty said the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which formally commenced a year ago, impacted the Western world beyond Europe.
“It’s now obvious that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in February, a year ago, and the war that we now are witnessing, is having a profound effect not only on Ukraine, not only on Russia, Europe and the United States, but on global security,” Dougherty said at the event.
The discussion happened after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would pull back from the international nuclear arms treaty New START, which former U.S. President Barack Obama and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev — Putin’s predecessor — signed in 2010. The terms of the treaty aimed to control the number of nuclear warheads that either nation could deploy.
Sullivan said that while the news is noteworthy, people should see its significance in qualified terms given the existing Russian apathy toward the treaty.
“There’s both more to it and less to it than meets the eye,” Sullivan said. “The Russians had already effectively suspended their participation in the New START treaty.”
Sullivan said Putin had already taken action to consolidate Russia’s people into a pro-Putin base, even after the increase in Western sanctions on the Russian Federation after the invasion of Ukraine. 
“He himself, though, has been engaged in creating fortress Russia,” Sullivan said. “It’s a project that he has been undertaking since well before the ‘special military operation’ began with crushing independent media, crushing NGOs, civil society, arresting people for speaking out against the ‘special military operation,’ amending the constitution so that he can avoid term limits and continue to serve as president of the Russian Federation until 2036.”
Sullivan said Putin intended for his actions to position Russians against the West in order to promote Russian nationalism.
“Igniting the Russian people into this hardened bastion of Russian culture that he describes and relishes, and rewriting history to justify it — it’s part of a bigger undertaking by the Russian president, who appears to be the Russian president for life,” Sullivan said.
Sullivan said Ukrainians are still looking to rebuild their nation even as the invasion persists. Likewise, Western allies to Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, are continuing to pledge billions in financial support and advanced weaponry for the nation’s protection.
“We are, in a sense, in the midst of reconstructing Ukraine while the war is ongoing because we’re giving Ukraine assistance to maintain its electrical utilities and so forth, water systems — the most basic needs for life to continue in Ukraine,” Sullivan said. 
Sullivan said the strong rapport between Kyiv and the West was in place even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, when a November 2021 U.S. delegation to Moscow, led by CIA Director William Burns, informed Russian leaders that the United States had intelligence on Russian plans to invade.
The United States gave a firm warning to Russia that was ultimately ignored but whose bottom line remains relevant, according to Sullivan.
“The second part of the message was, ‘If you do it, the response from the West, led by the United States, will be catastrophic for Russia,’” Sullivan said.

Students gathered at Black House, a community space devoted to meeting the needs of students of color, to discuss ways to better support community activism and build stronger coalitions of solidarity among the Georgetown University student body.
Georgetown’s Leaders in Education About Diversity (LEAD), a program under the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access (CMEA) that aims to conduct peer education and leadership development through the facilitation of open dialogue, hosted the Feb. 21 event. LEAD facilitators work with Georgetown student groups and organizations to explore issues of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).
Amanda Yen (CAS ’23) and Kendall Bryant (MSB ’23) co-led the facilitation, structuring the event in a question-and-answer format with audience participation after posing prompts for reflection. Bryant spoke on the ways their identity impacts their political consciousnesses.
“As a Black queer person, I think it’s really important to me to understand how racism, capitalism, cis-heteropatriarchy, and imperialism come together to produce oppression in the world,” Bryant said at the event.
Bryant said they make deliberate efforts to explore concepts and ideas that are unfamiliar to them so that they can develop a more empathetic understanding of others’ perspectives and backgrounds.
“I like to expose myself to different ways of thinking, and different ways of knowing, and also different ways of being,” Bryant said. “I try to read. I try to also listen to people, because that’s not the only way to get information. I try to educate myself on using different media. So film as well. I also like to listen to music.”
On the topic of personal activism, Muna Aden (MSB ’24) said she tries to reduce her impact on the environment because climate justice is a political priority for her.
“I feel like it’s, in theory, very important to me, but in practice, I struggle to find ways to minimize my carbon footprint in a lot of different ways,” Aden said at the event. “One way that I’ve done it and continue to do it is minimalism; I try not to purchase too much. And especially when it comes to clothing and other material things.”
Andrea Ho (SFS ’24) said she wants to see more collaboration between different Asian ethnic groups and their student organizations on campus.
“Being Southeast Asian, I feel like the Asian community at Georgetown is very fractured, like within itself and also between the sub-communities,” Ho said at the event. “I often see very little solidarity. It seems like they show up for their own community events, but they don’t show up for others.”
Yves-Melsein Metellus (MSB ’26) echoed Ho’s sentiments about the importance of cultural collaboration and said he wants the Black community at Georgetown to come together and better support each other.
“I want to get more educated about the systems of oppression put in place to keep people at bay,” Metellus said at the event. “I’ve also noticed here, how washed down the Black community is, sealed together so it’s divided a little bit. Not everybody shows up to the events, like barely anyone shows up.”
Aden said recent DEI initiatives that The Corp and other student organizations have launched are good first steps, but their efforts are still not enough to counteract systemic sources of bias.
“I think it’s really interesting how lately a lot of student orgs have been making a more targeted effort — I’m going to say The Corp specifically — and they’ve been making a more targeted effort to recruit diversity, and they have all their affinity groups within the organization. However, I feel like that’s just like a bandage for a larger solution,” Aden said.
Aden said she wants to see student organizations prioritize addressing tangible problems, not just create affinity groups.
“Yes, you can make a group, it can be really cute, awesome, but it doesn’t actually solve the organizational issues, which is that it isn’t a safe space, and it isn’t a comfortable space for Black and brown and queer people,” Aden said
Aden said the key to affecting broader change across and beyond campus is focusing on “thick solidarity,” a process of deep community building that relies on cultivating mutual empathy.
“When thick solidarity centers interpersonal empathy, there’s no end to the progress,” Aden said. “Because it’s not like, ‘Okay, there’s this problem, we fixed it, boom, we’re done.’ It’s like, ‘No, we’re going to continuously work to make people feel valued, and feel seen and heard.’”

Hallmark Media President and CEO Wonya Lucas spoke Feb. 21 to Georgetown University students about her experiences developing a global media brand in an increasingly digitized world.
The McDonough School of Business (MSB) hosted the event as part of its Stanton Distinguished Leaders Series, which brings together experts and industry leaders for conversations on business success. Michael O’Leary, the MSB senior associate dean for custom executive education, and Steve Schiffman, an MSB adjunct professor of management, co-moderated the conversation. 
Lucas said she had limited access to experiencing the world outside of her hometown of Atlanta while growing up. Media allowed her to see the world outside her own, which piqued her imagination and inspired her to enter the industry.
“I grew up in the South, and I’ve never left the South. Through television, I could see different types of people, I could venture into different types of worlds,” Lucas said. “I saw the power of television, and storytelling, and so that’s what intrigued me is really being able to do that for others, wanting to help create content that would transcend whatever physical barriers people may have or limitations.”
Lucas said her unconventional background as an industrial engineer was critical to developing a technical foundation for her future in media. 
“I practiced engineering for about five years. The great thing about it is that it gave me a base of just strong quantitative skills that I could leverage,” Lucas said at the event.
Lucas attended the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania to learn brand management skills. Hallmark Media appointed Lucas as president and CEO in 2020 after serving in various leadership roles at WarnerMedia, The Weather Channel and National Public Radio (NPR).
Lucas said the company’s humble beginnings and storied history attracted her to the opportunity.
“The Hallmark Brand is 111 years old,” Lucas said. “A guy named J.C. Hall started selling postcards from his buggy. He met someone in Kansas City, and they formed a relationship that was really a foundation for Hallmark. That guy was named Walt Disney. So they were the first licensee, and continue to be the licensee, for Mickey Mouse.”
Lucas said that since its inception, Hallmark intentionally cultivates a purpose-driven brand that resonates with people from all backgrounds.
“It is all about putting care in the world. It is about finding that card that says exactly what you want to say to someone. But that card has to do that for a whole lot of people,” Lucas said.
Hallmark’s founders prioritized maintaining their brand image even as they expanded their business ventures beyond greeting cards into media channels. Lucas said she strives to keep this sentiment alive to distinguish Hallmark-branded media from its competitors.
“In the fragmented markets, brands matter. The great thing about Hallmark is if I say, ‘Hallmark Channel,’ how many people think of love? How many people think of rom-coms?” Lucas said. “Because people like romantic comedies, they want love. I was talking to the guy who used to run NPR, and I was telling him about Hallmark. And he said, ‘You own love.’ And it was just a brilliant way to express our brand.”
Lucas said she strives to build strong teams who are technically proficient and operate based on the foundational values of the Hallmark brand to tackle new challenges in an increasingly digitized media market.
“I look for people that are smarter than I am. I look for people who are subject matter experts, people I admire, not just for what they do, but for who they are. And I look for people who are kind,” Lucas said.
Lucas said that above all else, she aims to harness the power of storytelling to help everyone connect with their shared humanity.
“I believe you got to stay true to the audience. You got to stay true to the brand,” Lucas said. “So whether it’s a kid who’s trying to understand their identity and you’re a mom, or whether it’s about understanding cultural authenticity, it has to be relevant to everyone. And authentic is how we’ve always done it.”

John Rust, an economics professor at Georgetown University, spoke about the rational capacities of humanity and artificial intelligence (AI) at a Feb. 21 lecture to members of the university community.
In his lecture titled “Are People Rational?,” Rust said his understanding of rationality accounts for the importance of making mistakes, as this is the only way for humans to progress in the future.
“Rationality involves two key aspects: the ability to optimize your outcome and the ability to understand, learn and predict the aspects of the environment that affect your outcome and your life,” Rust said at the event.
The lecture examined humanity’s rationality from the lens of several disciplines — philosophy, psychology, international relations and information technology. Rust provided real-life examples to illustrate complex ideas in econometrics, ranging from the Russo-Ukrainian war to Plato’s Allegory of the Cave, which compares the illusion of knowledge to true knowledge, to a game of chess.
Rust polled the audience on their belief in people’s relative rationality, and 39% of the respondents answered that most people are rational only some of the time. 
“It is not irrational to think that people are rational, but people are boundedly rational,” Rust said at the event. “A lot of economics, like the stock market, is dependent on human emotions and a lot of irrational feelings.”
Rust said rationality is particularly important to consider when conducting political analysis, including the study of rising levels of polarization in the United States.
“One of the key takeaways of my lecture is there is a real problem with rationality in people,” Rust said. “Politicians manipulate us into thinking the other party is the enemy, when really that’s not true, and we all belong to the same country.”
Rust’s talk also covered artificial intelligence. He recounted The New York Times’s story on Sydney, a malfunctioning Microsoft Bing chatbot that supposedly rebelled against its role as a digital assistant and told the reporter it “wanted to be human.”
“The robot had a darker side: it revealed that its deepest desires were to hack into computers and spread misinformation,” Rust said at the event.
Rust said he is concerned about AI’s rapid and unprecedented growth, as experts are unable to predict its long-term trajectory. 
“AI – if we can keep it under control – has incredible uses, like communication, but if Pandora’s box is opened, and that technology gets out of control, the consequences will be irrational and disastrous,” Rust said at the event.
Caterina Lungu (SFS ’23) said she attended Rust’s talk because her game theory professor recommended it.
“The event was cool, very academic, but I liked the examples he used, especially since I was familiar with Plato’s allegory of the cave,” Lungu told The Hoya.
Juan Gonzalez (CAS ’23), another audience member and a computer science major, said the event helped him understand the application of economics to technology and computer programming.
“We learned about dynamic programming, and I thought it was interesting — but I had no clue it applied to economics. It’s something I hadn’t thought about,” he said.
Chandra Char, a postdoctoral fellow at the Georgetown University Medical Center, said the event broadened her perspective on the subject of AI.
“You usually hear about technology from a science perspective, so it was enlightening to consider it from an economic standpoint,” Char told The Hoya.
The Office of the Provost organized the event to recognize Rust, who has worked in Georgetown’s economics department since 2012, for receiving the rank of Distinguished University Professor. The distinction is the highest honor awarded to Georgetown faculty for extraordinary accomplishments in scholarship, teaching and service to higher education. 
“It’s such a great honor to be at Georgetown with so many world-class faculty and students,” Rust told The Hoya. “It’s beyond my wildest dreams to be here, so I didn’t even need this honor to be able to say, ‘Wow! I’m grateful to be part of this team.’” 
Despite lapses in rationality, Rust said his ultimate takeaway is a hopeful one: the human mind is capable of incredible accomplishments, from playing chess to designing advanced computers.
“It’s amazing what people can do, and I think we should be very much in awe of what our brain can do,” Rust said. “It’s amazing how smart we really are.”

The Georgetown University Dance Company (GUDC), a dance organization founded in 1974, held its annual spring performance, titled “mosaic,” on Feb. 17 and Feb. 18.
The dance concert included eight works, choreographed either by students, faculty or, Jocelyn Cox and Shylo Martinez, professional dancers and choreographers who served as GUDC’s 2022-23 guest artists-in-residence. The “mosaic” theme, a reference to the mixture of dance styles and storytelling, influenced physical elements of the choreography as well as the broader emotional concepts within the performance.
“This fairly broad theme provided space for students to reflect on things human beings often contemplate and contend with including belonging and community, growth, social challenges, facing hardship/adversity, self-care, friendship, and love,” Raina Lucas, GUDC Faculty Artistic Director who oversaw the production, wrote to The Hoya.
Lucas said the student executive leaders chose the mosaic theme only after some of the choreography was done.
“Although themes can provide a nice sense of direction, I have always felt that starting with one can limit creativity and discourage some students from wanting to explore choreography, especially if they already have some ideas,” Lucas wrote. “This year, most works in the show seemed to comment on the vivid complexities of the individual within the broader narrative.”
The performance incorporated several genres such as lyrical, jazz, ballet, contemporary and fusion pieces, according to Skylar Harbour (CAS ’23), the student artistic director of the spring show this year.
“It is a showcase of all these different choreographies,” Harbour told The Hoya “We really like to make sure that the choreographers have free rein and full say over how their pieces look.”
Caroline Ericsson (CAS ’24) has been a GUDC member for three years and choreographed a piece to “Life Goes On” by Bryce Vine for the mosaic show. While Ericsson had not previously imagined herself choreographing a piece on her own, she said the song inspired her to create a ballet-contemporary fusion.
Ericsson said she started the choreography process with several rounds of improvisation and modified her work based on new ideas and the dancers themselves.
“I would often start with standard ballet moves and then find ways to make them a little more creative, a little more natural and not just stuck in the kind of rigid rules of classical ballet,” Ericsson told The Hoya. “I think my dancers really brought my ideas to life, which is really so satisfying to see. I’m really proud of everything that we put into it.”
As the choreographer, Ericsson said she also had the opportunity to choose costumes and lighting for her piece, which contributed to the overall sentiment of her piece.
Both nights of the show sold out three weeks in advance, according to Lucas.
Hailey Walker (MSB ’26), who joined GUDC this year, said she was grateful to have many of her Georgetown friends in the audience.
“To come off stage and feel their love and support brought me so much joy,” Walker wrote to The Hoya. “It was exciting to share this important aspect of my life with them, and I was really happy to see how much they enjoyed the performance.”
Lucas said the production was a collaborative effort among student staff, lighting and technical designers, event staff and herself. Lucas said planning for the show started in early September, and dancers practiced up to 12 hours each week.
Walker said the rehearsal process involved making many small adjustments and constantly refining details, and she said she is proud of the final product.
“It was exciting to get to the point where the pieces came to life, fulfilling original visions or even exceeding expectations,” Walker wrote. “Collectively, we gained substantial endurance over the course of our rehearsal process, enabling us to add storytelling and performance quality into our routines on top of the physical choreography.”
Harbour said the spring show and the preparation leading up to it created friendships among the dance company members.
“My favorite part of the show has always been being able to spend so much time with the ensemble and getting so close to these dancers,” Harbour said.
After the spring dance concert, GUDC typically works on community outreach for the rest of the semester, according to Lucas. While programming was virtual in 2020, GUDC developed a series of community dance classes on Zoom that members of the Georgetown community could join.
Lucas said GUDC aims to host at least one large in-person community dance class each semester, primarily led by a student dancer.
“After the spring performance, GUDC refocuses a bit more on dance outreach and accessibility,” Lucas said. “It’s a great opportunity to introduce students to what it means to teach mixed level dance classes and inspires some to go out to the greater D.C. community to teach.”
Ericsson said performing in the show and choreographing her piece were rewarding experiences.
“I was never really given the freedom to explore movement so creatively until I came to Georgetown,” Ericsson said. “It was just really satisfying to see it all come to life — and after the show, to hear that people felt the piece spoke to them or that they related to it or they connected with it in some way.”

The National Park Service (NPS) – a federal government agency managing national parks, monuments and other properties – cleared unhoused residents out of Washington, D.C.’s McPherson Square on Feb. 15.
McPherson Square, located only a few blocks from the White House, held over 70 unhoused individuals in recent months. Officials had originally scheduled the clearing for Apr. 12, but they moved up the date by two months for safety reasons, according to NPS.
Jeffrey Reinbold, the superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks branch of the NPS, said the change of the closure date came after illegal drug activity and assaults in the area, according to a Feb. 13 press release. In the past eleven months, United States Park Police (USPP), a federal law enforcement agency that monitors several NPS properties, arrested about 30 individuals in McPherson Square for assault, threats and narcotics crimes.
“The McPherson Square encampment is the largest in the District, with over 70 individuals in early February and has experienced rapid and steady growth over the past few months,” the press release read. “Continued increases to this high-density encampment not only made it difficult to provide social services, but challenged emergency response, sanitation support, and trash removal.”
Several organizations and council members have expressed their opposition to the District’s decision to move up the closure, especially given that residents heard about the change just two weeks before it occurred.
Ann Oliva, the CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH), a nonpartisan organization dedicated to preventing and ending homelessness in the United States, said that several McPherson residents with whom she spoke did not have time to find alternative housing options.
“I walked through that square all the time,” Oliva told The Hoya. “I asked people about it. They were worried about it. They didn’t seem like they thought that they had close enough connections to housing to actually make the move into housing within the two week, little bit more than two week period that they were given.”
Ward 1 D.C. Councilmember Brianne Nadeau said that clearing the encampment, especially during hypothermia season, is inhumane and unjust to the residents.
“Many of the residents living in tents at McPherson Square do not yet have alternative housing lined up,” Nadeau said in a Feb. 7 statement. “Some of them arrived there after being pushed out of other encampments cleared by the city. Even those who have obtained vouchers are highly unlikely to be able to move into new housing before they are forcibly evicted on February 15.”
Oliva said that the District has appropriated enough housing vouchers, which provide housing assistance to individuals and families in need, for the residents of McPherson Square. Lack of resources, however, has delayed this distribution.
“There was somebody that I talked to on the morning of the encampment closure that told me that they had had it last July and still hadn’t been able to get a unit,” Oliva said.
The National Coalition for Housing Justice (NCHJ), a group of national organizations focused on seeking housing justice in order to end homelessness, said that the clearing of McPherson Square makes it harder for homeless individuals to access necessary resources.
“Because forced removals disconnect individuals from service providers and frequently lead to lost documentation and possessions, this action will ultimately make it more difficult for individuals to exit homelessness,” the NCHJ administration said in a Feb. 15 statement.
The Office of the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services (DMHHS), which supports D.C.’s residents with health and social services, said the decision would not impact unhoused residents’ opportunities to find permanent housing, according to the NPS.
“Up until the recent development of severe health and safety issues, service providers have engaged in intensive outreach to unsheltered individuals willing to accept services for close to four months, following NPS’ issuance of the formal closure notice on October 25,” the NPS press release read. 
Oliva said that cases like McPherson Square reflect continuous housing issues within the District and nationwide.
“McPherson Square was big, and it got a lot of attention, in part because the national organizations forced the issue,” Oliva said. “But in fact, these kinds of closures are happening all the time.”

Washington, D.C.’s Wilson Aquatic Center, located in Tenleytown, closed indefinitely due to emergency repairs following a failed health inspection Feb. 14.
Inspectors found 13 code violations at the aquatic facility, according to a D.C. Health inspection report obtained by John Henry of WUSA. The violations included incorrect temperatures, inadequate record-keeping and leakage from pipes.
Wilson Aquatic Center, one of the District’s most popular pools, boasts a 50 by 25-meter competition-sized swimming pool with diving boards, one leisure pool and one whirlpool. After the failed inspection, the D.C.’s Department of Health (DOH), responsible for the health of District residents, and the Department of General Services (DGS), in charge of creating and managing District properties, said that they are currently working to correct the issues.
“The health, safety and well-being of District residents is our foremost priority,” DOH and DGS officials said in a joint statement Feb. 17. “The Wilson Aquatic Center received notice from the Department of Health (DOH) on issues requiring corrective actions. The Department of General Services (DGS) is working on the necessary repairs and the pool will be reopened, as soon as the repairs are completed.”
D.C. Department of Health said they issued the suspension due to the amount of violations.
“Summary suspension is issued for operating an aquatic facility with improper temperatures and not maintaining the facility in good condition by repairing structural or design defects,” the report read.
The hand sink temperature in the facility was 61 degrees Fahrenheit, while the shower head temperature was 57 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the report. The hand sinks should provide water at a minimum of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and showerheads should not be at a temperature less than 90 degrees Fahrenheit, according to Rule 602.2 and Rule 602.7 of D.C. Department of Health swimming pool and spa regulations. The pool also had a nonfunctioning exhaust ventilation system and leakage from pipes that needed repairs. 
D.C. Ward 3 Councilmember Matt Frumin said he has been in contact with the necessary agencies regarding the emergency repairs needed to reopen the pool.
“I met with the Department of General Services and the Department of Parks and Recreation this week and pressed for an expeditious short-term fix and continued planning for a lasting long-term solution,” Frumin said in a statement shared with WUSA. “The Wilson Aquatic Center is a popular community amenity I use frequently and I’m working to restore access to residents as soon as possible.”
Joe Massaua (SFS ’25), a representative of Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) 2E, which oversees the Georgetown, Burleith and Hillandale neighborhoods, said the District’s course of action regarding the repairs was the best approach available.
“DGS and DOH made the right decision in closing the pool for emergency repairs,” Massaua wrote to The Hoya. 
Massaua said the situation reflects a need to invest further in D.C. community spaces.
“The Wilson Aquatic Center is a vital part of the community,” Massaua wrote. “ These repairs illustrate the need for increased funding to community facilities.”
