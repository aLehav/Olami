A proposal by student group GU Fossil Free calling on the university to avoid investments in tar sands oil has received the support of about 200 members of the Georgetown community.
The proposal was submitted to the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, which advises the university on socially responsible investing policies, on November 6 . The CISR has received the proposal and is expected to discuss GUFF’s proposal at its next meeting, according to Rachel Pugh, the university’s senior director for strategic communications.
GUFF’s proposal argues that investments in tar sands oil extraction are inconsistent with the university’s Socially Responsible Investing policy, approved by Georgetown’s board of directors last June, which requires the university to take social and environmental impacts into account when making decisions concerning the university’s endowment investments. GUFF worked closely with administrators to establish the SRI last summer.
The greenhouse gas emissions associated with the process of extracting and refining tar sands oil are significantly greater than that of conventional crude oil, according to a 2009 report by the Department of Energy. Advocates argue that tar sands oil, primarily extracted in Alberta, Canada, contribute to climate change and environmental degradation in parts of Canada and the United States.
In its proposal, GUFF provided a list of 16 companies that receive most of their revenues from tar sands that Georgetown should avoid investing in.
The proposal is the latest divestment push for GUFF, which successfully lobbied the Board of Directors to divest the university’s funds from coal companies in 2015. The board also approved a student proposal to avoid direct investments in private prisons last month after three students submitted a broader proposal in January, bolstered by a three-month promotional campaign launched by the student group Georgetown University Forming a Radically Ethical Endowment.
The environmental implications of tar sands extraction make divestment from the industry a crucial step toward fulfilling Georgetown’s
commitment to social justice, according to Samantha Panchèvre (SFS ’19), a GUFF member.
“Georgetown is educating its students to be leaders in the world, to fight for a better political and social environment, and climate change is throwing all of that into disarray,” Panchèvre said. “So, by funding climate change, it’s very counterintuitive for an institution like Georgetown to fund climate change and also tell its students to go out and fight climate change.”
If CISR approves the proposal, it would be presented to the Committee on Finance and Administration within the board of directors for approval.
Pugh said the university takes non-investment proposals seriously.
“Georgetown University takes seriously matters related to social responsibility and its investments,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
GUFF argues the production and refinement of tar sands oil in Canada and the United States is a social issue as well as an environmental one. The group’s proposal notes the extraction process damages tracts of land sacred to indigenous North Americans, and also contaminates their drinking water and harms animal populations culturally significant to the First Nations groups.
Proponents of the tar sands extraction process argue that tapping North America’s vast reserves could reduce the United States’ dependence on oil sourced from Middle Eastern states.
GUFF member Celia Buckman (SFS ’21) said the university has a moral obligation to divest from an industry with such environmental and social problems.
Panchèvre said GUFF enjoys a close relationship with administrators after having worked closely with the administration to develop the SRI.
“We’ve had a really good relationship with administrators, and I think that’s evident by the passing of the Socially Responsible Investment Policy. We had one-on-one meetings with administrators,” Panchèvre said.
GUFF argues in its proposal that Georgetown cannot negotiate a change in tar sands oil companies’ production strategies or policies to make investment morally acceptable. At the heart of the unchangable problem are the production methods and products themselves, not the company policies, according to Buckman.
GUFF’s push for divestment from tar sands oil is a part of its greater effort to end Georgetown’s investment in fossil fuels, Buckman said.
Universities and institutions in both the United Kingdom and the United States have divested from tar sands oil, including Oxford University, the University of California system and the Church of England in 2015,and Boston University and Cambridge University in 2016.
Panchèvre said accepting the proposal would reaffirm Georgetown’s support for environmentally conscious policies.
“It’s just good press for Georgetown. It’s really a no-brainer,” Panchèvre said.

The Institute of Politics and Public Service’s celebration of the political legacy of former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) received generally positive bipartisan feedback from student leaders, despite the symposium’s lack of critical policy analysis and scrutiny of the former president’s alleged sexual misconduct.
In a keynote speech Monday to conclude the three-daylong celebration, Clinton focused on promoting cooperation between parties. Emphasizing that the responsibility falls on all Americans to start dialogue with those of opposing opinions, Clinton encouraged the audience not to further an “us-versus-them” mentality.
“The only way to think about it in a country as great as ours, the only sensible way to work toward a more perfect union, is to work toward inclusive economics, inclusive societies, inclusive cultures and inclusive politics,” Clinton said. “And that includes people who don’t vote with us — and may not even like us.”
In an interview with The Hoya, Allie Williams (SFS ’19), president of the Georgetown University College Republicans, and Larry Huang (COL ’19), chair of the Georgetown University College Democrats, said both groups recognized Clinton’s history of sexual misconduct despite their appreciation for the event and Clinton’s message.
Clinton has faced heavy allegations of sexual misconduct and has been accused by three women of unwanted sexual advances.
Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, accused Clinton in 1994 of harassing and exposing himself to her; Kathleen Willey, a former White House aide, accused Clinton in 1998 of groping her; and Juanita Broaddrick accused Clinton in 1999 of rape. Clinton has never been found guilty of sexual misconduct, but did admit to extramarital sexual relationships with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern in the Clinton White House, and Gennifer Flowers, a model and actress, both in 1998.
Huang said the GUCD board does not condone Clinton’s misconduct, but the board viewed the event as a rare opportunity to see a former president speak in person.
“As an organization, we are doing very concrete advocacy work to support sexual assault survivors,” Huang said. “We really want to highlight that, and if you take a look at how our organization is approaching Bill Clinton and the issue holistically, we prioritize survivors, and we try to be a survivor-centric organization, and in this case, it was just the fact that he’s a president, and we had the opportunity to meet him.”
Williams said she and the GUCR board had a conversation to analyze Clinton’s sexual misconduct allegations, and came to the same decision as the GUCD board to go to the event while keeping the issue in mind.
“Under my leadership, I’ve really tried to emphasize the fact that supporting sexual assault survivors is not a partisan issue,” Williams said. “We had the conversation like you did with [the GUCD] board. Obviously, it’s probably more of a topic you guys bring up, because my board isn’t 100 percent behind supporting survivors, unfortunately, which I think is something our party needs to work on, but something I think under my leadership we have been focusing on.”
While “Clinton 25” did not address more contentious aspects of Clinton’s presidency like the 1994 crime bill which disproportionately punished people of color or allegations of sexual misconduct, Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), GU Politics’ executive director, said the events did aim to delve into the ideas that got him elected.
“The goal of the Clinton 25 symposium was to reflect on the vision of President Bill Clinton — the vision that helped elect him president in 1992 and the vision that drove his time in office,” Elleithee wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While a lot of major policy issues came up during the course of Clinton 25, our goal was to host a conversation focused on the themes and vision of the Clinton administration, as opposed to focusing on a litany of policy decisions.”
Aaron Bennett (COL ’19), a member of the GU Politics Student Advisory Board, said events did not aim to take a deep dive into policy issues.
“To my understanding, this whole event was framed as sort of a reflection on not just the presidency of Bill Clinton, which was multifaceted, but how Georgetown specifically impacted that administration and those around him,” Bennett said.
Both Williams and Huang said Clinton’s bipartisan rhetoric is important for students to absorb.
Williams said GUCD and GUCR have already been working together to fight the “us-versus-them” sentiment through bipartisan dialogue, debates and policy forums.
As a Republican, Williams said she appreciated that Clinton was as open to speaking with her at the reception dinner as he was to speaking with Democrats.
“He’s very approachable; he’s the kind of politician that isn’t going to say to you, ‘if you’re a Republican, I don’t want to talk with you.’ He was equally interested in talking to me as he was to Larry,” Williams said.

Startup Hotel, an installation in Lauinger Library, is giving aspiring entrepreneurs a new opportunity to show off their startup projects.
The about 8-foot-tall translucent tower with shelves holding the products opened in mid-October in Midnight MUG, a Students of Georgetown, Inc. storefront on the second floor and first floors of Lauinger in the Maker Hub of the Gelardin New Media Center.
Georgetown alumnus Ryan Merlini (COL ’14) created the Startup Hotel to encourage student entrepreneurship. The project serves as a space for students to display and sell their invented products, which Merlini said can be a significant obstacle for startups in their early stages.
“When you first make something, it is really hard to get it out into the market. You either have to know somebody that is well-connected or has a big network and big box stores,” Merlini said. “There’s really no quick connection from local community, local D.C. product to a retail space.”
Items currently on sale in the Startup Hotel include are iPhone breathalyzers, miniature succulent plants and Merlini’s own project, a book entitled “Dogs That Can’t Even,” which features photos of apparently exasperated dogs.
Merlini oversees all the projects that receive spaces in the Startup Hotel and decides which ones make it to the shelves based on an application process. As interest increases, Merlini said he hopes that products will share the space on a rotating schedule to display a broader range of projects and give more opportunities to local and student entrepreneurs.
“The goal is to make space for local products, sort of inspire the same love and drive that people have around farmers markets around startups,” Merlini said.
Another Startup Hotel is set to be installed in Saxbys coffee shop, which is also slated to feature new products. U Apparel, an athletic clothing company founded by Ethan Rosen (MSB ’19), and Helping Hand Journal Series, activism-themed journals, that donatesome of the proceeds to social justice groups, are planned to be on sale at the upcoming installation in Saxbys.
The Journals’ co-founders Noah Martin (COL ’17, GRD ’19) and Jesse Flores (COL ’16) heard of the Startup Hotel and got in touch with Merlini through the Gelardin New Media Center and the Maker Hub.
Sonja Erchak (COL ’18), the director of Midnight MUG, said that though the project has only been in Midnight MUG for a few weeks, it has garnered significant attention.
“On all of my shifts and every time I’m in the store, I see people checking it out,” Erchak said. “When you tell people there’s a Startup Hotel, they don’t really know what you’re talking about. I think the curiosity of the name has been a big selling point.”
Erchak said she felt strongly about the being able to boost entrepreneurship at Georgetown as a member of Corp leadership.
“The financial component isn’t as significant as what it represents in our community, which is just that I think everyone on campus is constantly looking for a space to get their voice out there, get their passion projects out there, and that’s really important for me to be able to provide that for people,” Erchak said.
Merlini hopes his project can help students learn more about the financial and logistical resources available to them, adding that Georgetown has become a more supportive place for student startups over the last few years.
“When I was here in 2014, there was no way to sell anything you made before going to Red Square, and it made it impossible because you needed to have the time to sit out,” Merlini said. “I was extremely surprised at the entrepreneurial infrastructure that’s been built. Now there’s some serious funding; if you have an idea you’re able to get it started.”

A student health advisory board is set to launch next semester as a platform for students to voice health concerns on campus.
Administrators originally planned to establish the board this semester, a plan that was announced in February but did not come to fruition. The university now plans to get the board running by the spring, announced Assistant Vice President of Student Health Vince WinklerPrins, at a graduate student health care roundtable Tuesday.
The board is slated to be comprised of 20 student members from organizations including the Georgetown University Student Association and the Georgetown University Graduate Student Government. It will also include students elected to the board, a representative from Yates Field House and deans from the undergraduate and graduate schools.
Members of the board are to propose plans of action to university health care officials, including WinklerPrins, to address recurring issues.
Although WinklerPrins did not specify which issues would be prioritized, he expects mental health discussions and the university health care policy to be priorities for the board upon its launch.
The board will provide a platform for students to discuss a range of health issues on campus, according to WinklerPrins.
Director of the Student Health Insurance Office Laura Hardman Crosby encouraged graduate students to voice their concerns regarding their health insurance so that they can be addressed.
“If you’ve actually gone through the process and you have an appeal that you feel frustrated about or if you have received services that you feel frustrated with, we want to know about that. There’s no way for us to really know that there are problems out there unless you call us,” Crosby said at the event.
Several graduate students attending the event, including members of the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees, a labor union for graduate teaching assistants, voiced their discontent with the Premier Plan the university offers to undergraduate and graduate students.
Most full-time Georgetown students are mandated by the university to purchase the university-provided Premier Plan unless they fill out a waiver demonstrating they have other health insurance that meets the university’s coverage requirements.
Many graduate students purchase the Premier Plan because they are no longer eligible to be considered dependents under their parents’ plans and lack the funds to purchase a different plan, according to GAGE’s website. Approximately 43 percent of graduate students enroll in the Premier Plan, according to Crosby.
Members of GAGE and other students expressed discontent with the out-of-pocket premium rates included in the Premier Plan. In an intense exchange with a graduate student, Crosby said the mandate allows the university to keep prices low.
“We rely on the fact that we have a lot of people insured to keep costs down. That was Insurance 101 for me,” Crosby said.
In a letter to University President John J. DeGioia, GAGE demanded recognition of their labor union on Nov. 1. The group began preparing their proposal to unionize over a year ago. Securing a healthcare plan to better suit their needs is one of the group’s top priorities, according to GAGE’s website.
Contraception subsidization was another source of tension between students and health officials. Students asked if Georgetown would enact a similar policy to one at the University of Notre Dame, whose recent decision to stop covering birth control under their health insurance plan affected some undergraduate students. Notre Dame unexpectedly reversed its decision Tuesday after student backlash.
Georgetown will continue to cover contraception under the health care law requirement through the end of this insurance year, WinklerPrins said.
“Beyond that, this is an active question,” WinklerPrins said.

The historic United States-Mexico relationship faces an existential threat as public perception of both countries shifts and threatens diplomatic cooperation, a panel of experts argued Tuesday.
The speakers examined political and economic factors stressing the relationship between the two countries, including the ongoing renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement and President Donald Trump’s abrasive rhetoric toward Mexico.
Ambassador José Antonio Zabalgoitia, the representative for the Mexican Embassy in the United States and Deputy Chief of Mission, said the future of U.S.-Mexican relations is dependent on how both nations approach issues like trade, immigration reform and border security.
The United States, Canada and Mexico are in the process of renegotiating the terms and agreements of NAFTA, which went into effect in 1994. The deal eliminated trade tariffs and reduced trade barriers between the three North American nations.
“We are at a turning point in our bilateral relations, one in which, if we are able to move forward positively and collaboratively, we will really get into a great new stage,” Zabalgoitia said. “But otherwise, if we are unable to surmount the negatives and difficulties we are having and misperceptions on both sides, we’re in danger of moving backwards several decades in the relationship.”
Trump has routinely questioned the value of NAFTA, repeatedly calling the agreement the “worst trade deal ever made” during his 2016 presidential campaign, and ordering the U.S Trade Representative to renegotiate the deal July 2017.
Mexico is the United States’ third-largest trading partner, with trade in goods and services amounting to $579.7 billion in 2016 alone, according to data from the Congressional Research Service.
Antonio Ortiz-Mena, a Georgetown professor of Latin American Studies, said that, should NAFTA negotiations fail, the bilateral relationship would be seriously harmed.
“I think we might be reaching, rather than a turning point, a tipping point,” Ortiz-Mena said. “Should NAFTA go off the rails, and that’s a metaphor, it will be very difficult to get the whole bilateral relationship on track again, and it has to do partly with public opinion.”
Many Americans, however, have maintained a favorable perception of Mexico and its citizens according to Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute.
“Almost two-thirds of the United States, people in the United States, are trusting; [they] have a strong, favorable opinion of Mexico,” he said. “Nonetheless, it’s complicated.”
Trump has argued that NAFTA and an increase in Mexican migration have prompted companies to divert their resources to other parts of the world like Mexico and have hurt American workers.
Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, said Americans sometimes project fears of economic anxiety on Mexico.
“Some of the conversation is about our own anxieties and fears and also our hopes and dreams,” Selee said. “Mexico is a proxy for other things that are going on in this country.”
The panel proposed increased engagement with Mexico through tourism and academic exchange programs as a means to reconcile the lack of knowledge and distrust displayed by some U.S. citizens.
The Center for Latin American Studies, the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute, the Embassy of Mexico in the United States and El Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas, an independent Mexican research center, all sponsored the seminar.
Ortiz-Mena said Americans must strive to better understand Mexican culture.
“Something that has to be done is to bring the level of awareness of Mexico in the U.S.,” Ortiz-Mena said. “The level of awareness, the quality of knowledge and of debate has to be raised, regardless of what happens.”
Wilson said U.S. political leaders should propagate constructive perspectives about Mexico.
“We need strong, thought leadership expressed from the top levels in the United States,” Wilson said. “What we’re seeing right now is a great deal of skepticism about the value of the relationship being expressed from high levels, and so that’s not conducive to improve public opinion, which provides a framework for future cooperation.”
Gerardo Maldonado, a scholar from the Mexican Center for Economic Research and Teaching, said this relationship with the United States is a key issue in the 2018 Mexican presidential election.
The current front-runner in pre-election polls, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, is running on a Mexican nationalist agenda and has called for the scrapping of NAFTA. A López Obrador presidency could result in a hostile relationship between two populist leaders in Mexico and the U.S., according to experts.
“For many years, the United States has not been part of the election, of the discussion in different candidates,” Maldonado said. “Next year, the U.S., the Trump administration, is going to be part of also the election, is going to be part of how people will elevate different candidates and different parties.”
