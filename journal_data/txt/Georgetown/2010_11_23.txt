With pushes to scale back on penalties for marijuana use gaining ground nationwide, the student body has warmed up to use of the drug over time – even if the number of students inhaling has not risen considerably.
 
According to a 2009 Gallup poll, 44 percent of Americans favored legalizing marijuana – up from just 12 percent in 1970.
 
At Georgetown, a number of students seem to be taking a more liberal view on the subject, according to health experts.
 
Patrick Kilcarr, director of Health Education Services’ Center for Personal Development, has worked at Georgetown for 20 years. He said on-campus attitudes have shifted as of late.
 
“People would really, in the early years, in the ’70s and ’80s, have a strong opinion one way or another about marijuana,” he said. “And [now] I think even if people don’t smoke marijuana and have no desire to, their opinion of marijuana has very much softened.”
 
But while attitudes about marijuana have shifted, students at Georgetown do not appear to be using marijuana more than before.
 
James Welsh, assistant vice president for student health, said that the rate of marijuana use on campus has not changed significantly in the past 10 years.
 
“The perception of marijuana use far exceeds the actual use,” he added.
 
The Office of Student Affairs declined to release statistics from student health surveys about marijuana use that it gathered over the past decade, as it keeps the numbers confidential for internal planning purposes.
 
But Kilcarr, who used data from the student health surveys, said that they show that the rate of marijuana use is fairly close to the national average.
 
“It doesn’t say to what degree, so it could be a student who smoked once a week or a student who smokes four times a day but about 13 percent of our students at any point in time would say that they had smoked marijuana within the last 30 days,” he said.
 
According to its official crime log, the Department of Public Safety dealt with 16 drug crimes in September and October. Eight involved “suspicious smells” and seven involved an unidentified drug. In the last, the drug was explicitly identified as marijuana.
 
And for many users, the availability of marijuana on the Hilltop has been subject to circumstance.
 
One Georgetown sophomore who uses marijuana occasionally said that many of the drug’s users and dealers on campus took a step backward after three freshmen were arrested in October on drug charges – two for attempting to produce Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a hallucinogen, in their Harbin dorm room and one for possession with intent to distribute marijuana.
 
“Everyone got very hesitant to sell to anybody new, or just use it in general,” he said. “When you have [Drug Enforcement Agency] agents walking around on campus, that’s usually kind of intimidating.”
 
But, he added, the drug’s presence on campus is already on its way back to normal availability. “I’ve already seen it easing up,” he said.
 
In Kilcarr’s capacity as director of the Center for Personal Development, he meets with many student drug users involved in disciplinary proceedings. Kilcarr added that while the number of students he sees about marijuana has increased slightly in the past few years, the numbers of students with more serious problems has not.
 
“The problems that students are coming in with, they haven’t increased,” Kilcarr said. “There isn’t an increase in problems, or an increase in students that really have this psychological need to continue to use.”
 
Kilcarr said he worries most about the students who use marijuana every day, or who use it as a crutch to deal with everyday problems. According to him, however, the majority of the students he sees do not fit that description.
 
But occasionally he sees students who challenge his expectations.
 
“I’ve had a student sit on my couch who said, `You know what, I have a 4.0, I’m a junior at this college, I smoke every day, and how can you tell me it’s wrong to smoke?’,” he said.
 
The growing acceptance of marijuana in American culture is also reflected by D.C. law. The penalties for a first offense of marijuana possession in Washington are low – Kilcarr compared the penalty to that of a traffic ticket. In June, medical use of marijuana became legal under District law to treat some chronic illnesses.
 
The D.C. government is still finalizing the regulations for licensing marijuana dispensaries, but some businessmen are already scouting the scene. One, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid hurting his chances of a successful application for a dispensary permit, said he is considering setting a dispensary up in the neighborhood of Georgetown. He said, however, that some in the area remain skeptical.
 
“The local community in Georgetown has been receptive but not overly so,” he said. “A lot of the landlords in Georgetown will simply not allow their property to be used for this purpose.”
 
But, he said, marijuana has always had a presence in the neighborhood.
 
“Having lived about 10 miles west of Georgetown since 1977 in the same house, I can remember visiting Georgetown as a kid to go to the bars and the head shops,” he said. “Cannabis has always been around Georgetown and always will be.”
 
The anonymous sophomore who smokes occasionally believes that in the long run, laws on marijuana will change to respond to the society’s growing openness toward the drug.
 
Referring to this year’s failed California ballot initiative to legalize marijuana, he said: “It didn’t pass, but the side that was in favor of it still had more votes than Meg Whitman, the runner-up for governor. The acceptance level is obvious.”

I will refrain from any Cold War cliches as best I can, but talking about the United States, Russia and arms control is going to make that harder than hiding missiles in Cuba. The Senate is currently threatening to stall debate on the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) legislation, which poses some enormous diplomatic problems. If they fail to ratify such an important treaty before the end of the year, Congress risks not only disappointing Russia, but also lowering American credibility around the world, because they will have inadvertently cast a spotlight onto how partisan and gridlocked our political system has become.
The first START evolved from the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) and SALT II; treaties that Presidents Ford and Carter signed with the Soviet Union. Over the years, arms control has been one of the few issues that American and Russian leaders have found common ground on. In 1980, presidential candidate Ronald Reagan was privately against arms control in fear that it would weaken the United States’ ability to respond to nuclear war, so he campaigned on missile defense expansion as an alternative to nuclear weapons. Instead of signing treaties that controlled how much the two sides could build up, Reagan wanted to be the one who rid the world of nuclear weapons altogether. In 1987, he signed a treaty with the USSR banning intermediate-range ballistic and nuclear missiles; Republicans hailed him for it, and his successor, Bush Sr., rode that momentum to get START approved in 1991.
It is because of these agreements that the United States and Russia have reduced their missile count by 17,000 over the last 40 years. The GOP, who hold arms control so dear because of the patronage of Reagan and Bush Sr. cannot and should not let it expire because of partisan politics. Senator John Kyl (R-Ariz.) said last year, “For the first time in 15 years, an extensive set of verification, notification [and] elimination … measures will expire. The United States will lose … its ability to understand Russian strategic nuclear forces.”
Sen. Kyl is now leading the Republican obstruction to reaching an agreement; it is perplexing as to why they are abandoning their conservative icon Ronald Reagan when a chance to do something he would do is staring them in the face. Republicans are so afraid of appearing on the same piece of paper with President Obama that they have concluded doing nothing is the best option. They should listen to fellow Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), who said, “Every senator has an obligation in the national security interest to take a stand, to do his or her duty.” That’s why he is asking Democrats to vote anyway – he understands the larger consequences.
If Congress does not do its duty, Russia won’t even entertain the idea of such a deal again for a long time. President Dmitri Medvedev risked a lot to get his government to support the treaty and won’t be happy if Obama fails on his promise. Republicans should realize hurting their own president comes at the risk of undermining a powerful international diplomatic ally. Is that worth having the satisfaction that they defeated an Obama policy goal? Furthermore, failure to renew this deal will discredit the United States’ dedication to future negotiations with other nations; if we couldn’t deliver on this, will next time be any different?
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pointed out a further ramification of putting negotiations on hold: American inspectors haven’t been allowed into Russian military installations in over a year. One would think everyone could agree that not knowing where Russia’s nuclear arms are is not a good thing. And it’s unbelievable that Republicans also ignored Sen. John Kerry’s (D-Mass.) point that there is high bipartisan support for the treaty. This is an opportunity for Republicans to come out against the status quo of petty partisanship in Washington, but it’s as if they have selective amnesia that causes them to forget everything they’ve previously said about the Obama administration.
Democrats should follow through on Lugar’s proposal. It’s far better for a few Democrats to lose their seats in Congress in 2012 because they did the right thing than have the whole Russian Parliament, along with the rest of Europe, laughing at our dysfunctional domestic politics. Democrats are trying to draw just one positive achievement from the empty, all-consuming petty void that our politics have become, and it’s about time the GOP lend a hand.

Georgetown students brought home both the Mitchell Scholarship and the Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship this year, but for the second year running, no students were named Rhodes Scholars.
The Mitchell Scholarship, a one-year fellowship to pursue post-graduate studies at an Irish university, was awarded to Derick Stace-Naughton (COL ’11), an English and physics double major. By producing its 10th Mitchell Scholar since the program launched in 2001, Georgetown boasts the most Mitchell scholar winners among U.S. universities.
Sarah Gardiner (SFS ’11), a staff writer for THE HOYA, was named a Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellow last week while she was studying abroad in Cote d’ Ivoire. The fellowship, which is funded by the U.S. Department of State and administered by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, requires its participants to serve as foreign service officers after graduating and passing the Foreign Service Officer Test.
The winners of the Rhodes and Marshall Scholarships, two of the most prestigious
fellowships, were also announced recently. This year, however, Georgetown did not produce a winner for either award, though 23 students have been named Rhodes Scholars since 1984. Over the years, Georgetown students have also won 18 Marshall Scholarships.
“We see far fewer potential candidates than we should,” said English professor John Glavin, university fellowship secretary. “I think people just don’t think enough about it. Georgetown should have more people in these races.”
In 2010, a total of 19 Georgetown students applied for at least one of the four post-graduate fellowships that Glavin oversees – the Rhodes, Churchill, Marshall and Mitchell – fewer than in years past, according to Maryam Mohamed, associate director of the Office of University Fellowships.
“Perhaps it has something to do with the current financial crisis. Students don’t want to take a gamble on something that’s not a sure thing. And in terms of sheer statistics, [applying] is a pretty hard argument to make,” Mohamed said. “But I think there’s a lot that can be learned from the process of applying, in particular the writing and the practice interviews.”
The application process for students interested in pursuing the Rhodes, Marshall, Mitchell or Churchill Scholarship in 2011 begins at the end of this month.
The Mitchell scholarship, which is sponsored by the U.S.-Ireland Alliance and awarded to just 12 American students per year, will send Stace-Naughton to the University of Ulster, where he plans to pursue a master’s degree in health communication.
Inspired by the Science in the Public Interest class he took as a sophomore, Stace-Naughton decided to investigate the relationship between scientific research and public policy. Ultimately, this led him to work with Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.) and propose the Bleeding Disorders Screening, Awareness and Further Education Act of 2010. The bill calls for an educational campaign about bleeding disorders for health professionals and programs to ensure that patients are referred to the correct doctors, among other proposals.
For Stace-Naughton, government-sponsored medical research has personal implications. He suffers from a genetic condition that prevents his blood from clotting properly. His mother and sister, for reasons science has not been able to identify, have much more severe cases of the same condition to the point where they are physically debilitated.
“I have chosen to commit my time, my knowledge and my energy to support those with bleeding disorders who have not enjoyed my good fortune,” he wrote in the personal statement he submitted with his Mitchell Scholarship application.
As a Mitchell Scholar, Stace-Naughton will have the opportunity to travel the country and meet with Irish government officials. He is also looking to learn more about the Irish health care system.
Speaking from across the Atlantic Ocean, Gardiner, like Stace-Naughton, was first inspired by a class she took early in her Georgetown career.
“I took a culture and diplomacy class once I got here,” Gardiner said in a university press release. “The more I studied in the Institute of Diplomacy, the more I considered it as a potential career path.”
Since 2009, Gardiner has interned at Amnesty International, the American Society of International Law and Sister Cities International. She also spent studied abroad during her junior year in western and central Africa.
With the new fellowship, Gardiner will receive funds toward her senior year tuition and expenses and her first year of graduate school.
The 2010 Churchill scholars have yet to be announced.

After a four-year legal battle, the popular file-sharing website LimeWire has been shut down for good.
A New York federal court ruled against the website last month, saying that its file-sharing process had assisted in an enormous amount of copyright infringement. The ruling came at the end of a four-year battle between LimeWire and the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents a number of record labels.
Founded in 2000 by Wall Street trader Mark Gorton, LimeWire allowed its 50 million users to search for and share copyrighted material. The website remains functional, but on Oct. 26 it posted a notice citing the court order that had restricted it from distributing its file-sharing software.
Georgetown students were still surprised by the verdict.
“I guess I probably could have expected it would happen eventually, after Napster years ago and everything else that’s being shut down,” Andrew Levine (COL ’11) said. “But I didn’t see it coming anytime soon.”
For Mike Garza (COL ’12), the shutdown also came as a surprise, since he had assumed that the website would have worked out its legal issues by now.
“I figured with the whole Napster situation that LimeWire and other downloading hosts would have had all their bases covered,” Garza said.
Napster, the grandfather of MP3 sharing, was created in 1999 by Northeastern University student Shawn Fanning. At its height, it claimed over 100 million users. After a court order, the website went offline, and its name and logo were bought after the company went bankrupt. Since 2004 it has resurfaced as an online MP3 store.
For music lovers, sites like LimeWire and its predecessor, Napster, made it easy to find and acquire singles but not necessarily whole albums. Still, some former users said they had stopped using file-sharing sites like LimeWire years before the lawsuit because the programs had caused problems with their computers. For many, the ease with which the files could be acquired seemed to be a cause for nervousness.
“At least with iTunes you have a sense of where the songs come from,” Levine said. “On LimeWire, it’s just all from a jumble of cyberspace, and probably from some Russian hacker who’s making a fortune on this.”
Several students were shocked by the shutdown. Most were not worried about downloading music in the future, since they can still get music from other places like FrostWire.
Another file-sharing software program, FrostWire was actually designed by members of the LimeWire open source community, and it functions similarly to LimeWire. As of right now, the site has not been shut down.
Artists contend that they lose money from such sites as FrostWire, while fans say that the artists simply gain more popularity. According to Garza, he can see both sides of the issue.
“I understand file-sharing from both standpoints. As a sharer you really don’t want to purchase an entire album for one song, so you download it. But as an artist and record company, you lose a lot of money with sites like LimeWire and FrostWire,” Garza said. “So, I guess I am undecided because I know I don’t want to pay for an entire album and listen to one song, but I completely understand it’s a business for the guys on the other side.”

Over 100,000 people, ranging from university students to executives to those facing homelessness gathered on the National Mall Saturday for the 23rd annual “Help the Homeless Walk.”
The walkathon raises money for the more than 12,000 people in the District who are living without shelter of their own. Since its beginning in 1988, the walk has raised $80 million toward relief efforts.
Hoya Outreach Programs and Education was joined by other Georgetown student groups to march for the cause. Women’s club soccer, Knights of Columbus and College Democrats, among others, composed the group of Georgetown students that boarded the two buses funded by The Corp Philanthropy Committee, according to HOPE co-chair, Victoria Glock-Molloy (COL ’11). The Saxatones also sang at the event.
“All HOPE board members who could make it were there and many others had helped to plan and advertise the event. We also had a number of regular volunteers attend the walk as well,” she said. “What was even better, though, was seeing so many people I don’t know – over the past few years HOPE has tried especially hard to make this an event where students from every part of campus life show up together to help mitigate a serious problem in our larger community.”
Adelfi, Catholic Daughters of America and GU Right to Life also raised funds for the walk in advance. Georgetown students raised at least $1,500 according to Glock-Molloy.
Individuals could choose an organization to which they donate registration fees and funds.
“We participated in the walk and, with registration fees, raised $80 to benefit Back On My Feet, an organization that works to promote confidence and self-sufficiency in the homeless,” said Katie Mercuro (COL ’12), community service director for the College Democrats.
“Along with GU Right to Life, we walked to raise money for the Northwest Pregnancy Center, whom we work very closely with,” said Kevin Kuehl (SFS ’11), chancellor and head of community services for the Georgetown Knights of Columbus. “The Northwest Center provides resources and assistance to impoverished women in order to help them raise healthy children.”
Bright Beginnings, Inc., a child and family development center for homeless families with young children, also gathered on the Mall to raise awareness for the 150 students it serves, representing their needs and challenges during this year’s walkathon.
“We believe every homeless child should have a bright beginning,” Executive Director of Bright Beginnings Betty Jo Gaines said in a press release.
ore than 6,500 people in the District are homeless. The number of homeless people in the area has increased by approximately 5 percent over the last year. It includes about 800 families and 1,500 children under the age of 5.
This year big sponsors and supporters included organizations such as Friends of Samaritan Ministry of Washington and Accenture. Organizations benefiting from this years walk included Georgetown Ministry Center and local soup kitchens.
Although soup kitchens were among the various organizations aided by the walkathon, D.C. area soup kitchens are still experiencing the highest demand in years for Thanksgiving dinners, as reported by The Washington Post.

A student body referendum on a possible shake-up to the Student Activities Fee – a $100 charge included in tuition dollars – is slated to take place Dec. 7 to Dec. 9 via an online ballot.
Members of the Georgetown University Student Association Senate, which officially set the terms of the general vote at its meeting Sunday, said at least 2,000 students must participate in the referendum in order for the bill to pass.
If approved by student voters, the measure would earmark the entirety of the Student Activities Fee toward student groups. The fee would also be increased from $100 to $150 by the 2012-2013 school year.
Greg Laverriere (COL ’12), chairman of GUSA’s Finance and Appropriations Committee, which launched the reform this fall, said he was hopeful participation rates would be high enough to grant passage.
“I am cautiously optimistic that we will be able to get the 2,000 votes necessary to validate this referendum,” Laverriere said. “While it is not an easy task to get 2,000 votes, there are a lot of students and clubs motivated to see this plan pass.”
Laverriere made it clear that committee members will do everything they can to ensure they reach their 2,000 vote goal.
“We will be reaching out to students by all means necessary. Flyering, tabling, dorm storming we will be doing everything to raise awareness for [Student Activities Fee Endowment] reform,” he said.
“If you are on campus it will be hard not to notice our efforts about the upcoming referendum,” Fin/App Vice Chairman Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) said.
Though September’s GUSA Senate elections did not yield a large student voting turnout, with as little as 5.5 percent participating in the Village A E-H district, for example, Malkerson said he was optimistic students would mobilize – so long as senators work to publicize the issue.
“The senate elections didn’t have huge turnout, true. However, in last year’s executive election more than 3,000 students participated,” he said. “For this referendum we are planning an unprecedented effort at getting students to vote. I am fully confident we will have at least 2,000 students participate and many more,” Malkerson said.
For Laverriere, the potential impact of the changes will be essential in overcoming voter apathy problems.
“I think voting on SAFE reform will get a larger turnout because it affects every student,” Laverriere added.
If the changes are implemented, the Student Activities Fee will be increased gradually over the course of two years – from $100 to $125 in the 2011-2012 school year and then to $150 during the 2012-2013 year. Beginning in the 2013-2014 school year, the fee will be raised to match the standard rate of inflation. With 100 percent of the fee allocated to student activities, half of the fee would no longer go toward the Student Activities Endowment, which saved the money for an eventual investment back into Georgetown.
The GUSA Senate passed this referendum with a vote of 22 in favor and two opposed. Many members of the Senate voiced their strong endorsement of SAFE reform.
“SAFE reform will do more for the student body than anything GUSA has ever done,” Fin/App member Chris Pigott (COL ’12) said. “Once the funding is allocated and the groups learn how to spend the extra money, students will see a much better Georgetown. There will be more concerts, speakers, events, practice equipment, et cetera. It will affect everything on campus.”
Fin/App Committee members said they took the student body’s needs into account when crafting the bill over the past month.
“In putting this [referendum] together we have talked to clubs, advisory boards, people who this affects – this bill was well thought out, well-constructed, and everyone is on board,” Fin/App member Tyler Sax (COL ’13) said.
So far, student reaction has been varied.
“This fee increase is way too much. GUSA should just allocate all of the current $100 fee to student activities,” Anastasia Baran (COL ’13) said. GUSA decided to augment the fee to deal with the ever-rising inflation of costs, the increase in the number of student groups, and budgetary needs of the six advisory boards it serves.
With these concerns in mind, some students said it was time to put the issue to a referendum.
“I support the fee increase because a lot of student organizations, especially club sports, are under-funded and could benefit from SAFE reform,” Caroline Burns (NHS ’13) said.

Due to the recent crime surge on campus, which has included multiple burglaries and laptop thefts, the Department of Public Safety is bolstering its on-campus security with a lineup of new preventative measures.
In response to the increase in laptop thefts at Lauinger Library, DPS is meeting with library staff next week in order to discuss the risk factors for Lauinger. One problem, according to Smith, may be the inadequate library space, which students try to reserve by leaving their laptops as place markers.
“I know that library study space is limited, but leave your coat and take your laptop. The thief isn’t after your coat – he is after the laptop,” Joseph Smith, associate director of DPS said.
Ultimately, Smith said, the goal is to prevent crime, not just to catch criminals after the theft. Though making arrests is an integral duty of law enforcement, the ideal solution is to lessen the opportunity for crime, he said.
“If we can change the underlying conditions, we can prevent it in the first place,” Smith said. “To me, it’s a partnership between DPS and the students, and they can help us out by not leaving doors open and laptops out.”
Earlier this month, DPS introduced new nightly security checkpoints at both the Canal Road and Prospect Street entrances to campus. At the checkpoints, which will be operational between 10:30 p.m. and 6 a.m., DPS will determine whether or not drivers have a legitimate reason to be on campus and provide instruction and directions to drivers who may be lost.
According to Smith, the added security measure is part of an overall security intensification that has also included an increase in uniformed security personnel, especially in Village A.
“We felt it was important that we strengthen our visual presence,” Smith said.
According to Smith, measures have been taken to improve the lighting at Village A and to strengthen the security of doors and windows in the upperclassmen apartments. DPS is also working on a program to educate students in best security practices in order to prevent future crimes.
“The vast majority of our losses are because of unlocked doors and windows and unattended property,” Smith said. “I think that there’s a social aspect [in leaving doors unlocked], but there’s kind of a time and a place for everything.”
Students have reacted well to the new security measures, saying that the greater DPS presence has given them a little more presence of mind.
“If I come home from [Lauinger] at one in the morning and see three security officers, I definitely feel safer,” Village A resident Nikhil Lakhanpal (MSB ’13) said.
Brett Harris (MSB ’13) agreed, adding that the decrease in the number of email alerts achieves the point of the increased security around Village A.
“There was a week a few weeks ago where we had [many] alerts, and now we haven’t had nearly as many,” Harris said.

The Philodemic Society opened a new library last Saturday on the fourth floor of the Leavey Center. The new collection features books donated by past members and supporters of the society to aid Philodemicians in their research.
“The library will be a resource for all Philodemicians to find books and multimedia relevant to their debates [and] academic work, and also for personal enjoyment,” said Philodemic Society Librarian Sam Dulik (SFS ’13).
“The library space can be used for Officer Corps meetings, mentor meetings, keynoter meetings, speaking workshops and a variety of other Philodemic-related events,” Dulik added.
On Saturday, Dulik lectured fellow society members on the history of the Philodemic Society, the oldest student organization on campus. Dulik said that he will also lead a field trip to the space for society members and friends on Wed., Dec. 1.
The library’s opening fostered a sense of pride among society members.
“The library is a great asset in the society’s efforts to institutionalize the society and have a permanent presence on Georgetown’s campus,” said Greg Miller (SFS ’14), who aims to be inducted into the society. “It made me proud to learn that I am joining such a prestigious and deep society.”
Through the library, which is open to all students, the society hopes to invite more Georgetown students into the society’s affairs.
“Many titles that we hold in the Philodemic library are not even in circulation at Lauinger,” Miller said.”
