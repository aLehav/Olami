Over the weekend, the department of biology accidentally sent congratulatory e-mails to 30 regular decision applicants who have not been officially accepted to Georgetown University for the undergraduate Class of 2014.
The error occurred when the Office of Undergraduate Admissions sent to the biology department a list of students who had been accepted under the early action admissions cycle and indicated an interest in majoring in biology, according to Senior Associate Director of Admissions Melissa Costanzi. Unintentionally included in this list were the names of 30 students who had not applied during the early action cycle, but had been flagged by the admissions office as likely to be accepted.
The biology department sends e-mails to students accepted to the university through early action each year to congratulate them on their acceptance, detail the offerings of the biology department and encourage them to come to GAAP weekends, according to Steven Singer, chair of the biology department.
The Georgetown Office of Undergraduate Admissions does not inform students of application results online or via e-mail, relying solely on letters. These e-mails were only meant to be sent to students who had already received their letter of admission, Singer said.
In response to the accidental congratulatory e-mails, the admissions office sent out a second e-mail to the 30 students explaining that while they had not officially been accepted yet, they had been sent the e-mail because they were likely to be admitted at the end of March.
“We saw this as a perfect opportunity to give these highly qualified students a `heads-up’ about their decisions,” Costanzi said in an e-mail. “While we don’t normally send out these types of `likely’ admit letters, many of our colleagues at other schools, including some of the Ivies, regularly send them out.”
The students are not guaranteed admission, despite the e-mails.
“Students who receive likely letters are told they have a 95 percent chance of being accepted, and we would like them to know that now,” Costanzi said. “They are not guaranteed because something could happen between now and April 1 that could change this, such as a disciplinary issue or decline in academic performance.”
Singer expressed concern about the situation, but said that the admissions office had responded appropriately.
“I asked the admissions office to let us know the fates of these students. We will contact those who are admitted,” Singer said. “I will encourage the admissions office to contact those who are rejected, if there are any, to explain the situation and circumstances.”
Singer was hopeful that if the students affected by the e-mail are accepted, they will consider Georgetown’s response to the mishap in their decision.
“I hope Georgetown’s speedy way of dealing with this in a positive manner will end up influencing them in a positive way, but it will probably have little impact on their final decision: that will depend more upon financial aid and their results from other schools,” Singer said.
Costanzi said that while applicants who received the e-mail initially showed confusion, they were pleased with the way Georgetown handled the situation.
“Best news of all is that we have received many happy and excited e-mails and phone calls from these applicants and their parents thanking us for clarifying the situation in such a positive manner,” Costanzi said.
According to Singer, there was no precedent for such an error in the biology department. He was unable to comment on any such incident in other academic departments, but said it was unlikely that such an error had occurred in undergraduate admissions before. In 2007, the McDonough School of Business’s MBA admissions office accidentally sent out an e-mail to all applicants telling them that they had been waitlisted. Over 300 of those applicants had already received an admissions decision.
Similar errors have also occurred at other universities nationwide. In February, The George Washington University’s Office of Undergraduate Admissions accidentally sent congratulatory e-mails to all prospective students who applied to the early decision II program. According to The GW Hatchet, the early decision II applicants numbered over 800 students. Last spring, the University of California, San Diego’s admissions office accidentally sent acceptance e-mails to all of its 46,000 applicants.

Philly Pizza & Grill will appear in D.C. Superior Court Friday for a hearing that will likely result in the establishment’s closure the same day, marking the final straw in the owner’s struggle to stay open despite a Feb. 19 order enforcing the removal of its certificate of occupancy, according to Vice Chairman of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission-2E Bill Starrels.
Owner Mehmet Kocak has been subjected to fines while his business has remained open illegally, Starrels said. The local late-night favorite among college students has been open daily for limited business hours, until midnight, according to a Philly Pizza employee.
The D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs had issued Philly Pizza a notice to end illegal use of the location on Feb. 19.
“Philly’s is in violation of the orders of the DCRA. There’s not much we can do but follow the rules here of the District and let the law take its course,” Starrels said.
While Philly Pizza continued to operate as of press time, some students said they were unaware its doors were still open.
“I originally thought Philly’s was closed this weekend and then found out later it was open,” Lindsay McDonnell (NHS ’11) said.
The confusion regarding the Potomac Street business’s operating status led to a shift in student traffic in the area this weekend, according to local business owners.
Sam Wazzeh, the manager of Quick Pita, located across the street from Philly Pizza, said, “The student traffic [on the street] was less than before.”
At Tuscany Café, a late-night eatery located on Prospect Street between Potomac Street and Wisconsin Avenue, the daytime manager has noticed an upswing in business.
“I think this weekend’s [number of customers] was significantly better than the weekend before,” he said.
Some Georgetown students capitalized on the perceived absence of Philly Pizza by selling pizza and baked goods at Healy Gates late at night this weekend. Nick Joosten (COL ’13), the treasurer of the pledge class for Alpha Kappa Psi, a business fraternity with a Georgetown chapter, organized the event, which garnered an overall profit of over $240 by selling baked goods and Domino’s Pizza on Friday and Saturday nights from 11 p.m. until 2:30 a.m. Joosten said he intends to sell pizza again in the coming weekends, yet plans to begin selling at midnight and stop selling at 2:30 a.m.
“People didn’t know if Philly’s was closed or not,” Joosten said. “They are supposed to be closed, so I used that to advertise – `Philly’s is closed, get your pizza here.'”
Kocak, and his lawyer Patrick Brown Jr. declined to comment on the situation.

A 2009 study by financial lender Sallie Mae found that today’s college students are spending more on credit than at any point in history: 84 percent of college undergraduates have at least one credit card – an increase of 8 percent since 2004.
But following the Feb. 22 national implementation of the Credit CARD Act, which was passed in May 2009, some students might change the way they view spending on credit.
This legislation includes provisions that are intended to protect younger spenders from falling into a credit trap. It bans credit card issuers from providing cards to consumers who are under the age of 21, unless the consumer has an adult co-signer or can present proof that they have a stable enough income to repay any debt.
Additionally, the act prohibits lenders from advertising with free merchandise on campus – including pizza, T-shirts and beach towels – as a means of enticing students to sign up for a credit card.
According to Phillip Swagel, who directs the Center for Financial Institutions, Policy and Governance at McDonough School of Business, the legislation is government’s way of preventing younger consumers from being fiscally irresponsible.
“It’s sort of trying to protect people from themselves,” Swagel said. “[Credit cards are] a great tool, but they can be a positive thing or a negative thing, depending on [people’s] use [of] them.”
A 2002 study by Georgetown’s now-defunct Credit Research Center found that among all age groups, people aged 18 to 24 were more likely to spend on credit than members of other age groups.
The study also concluded that while the average balance of a student credit card account is about one-fourth the size of the average credit account of an active, older adult, students had higher delinquency rates.
Swagel, who got his first credit card while in college, said that smart spending is a matter of planning.
“Spending on a credit card is, in a sense, spending on their future incomes,” Swagel said. “There’s no such thing as a free lunch – spending is spending.”
But Justin Lo Iacono (MSB ’10), outgoing chief executive officer of Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union, said that a bit of spending on credit can be positive for students.
“College is the first time many students become financially independent. There are certain advantages to having a credit card – most notably, it is a convenient way to build credit,” he said in an e-mail.
While the legislation will make it more difficult for profit-seeking credit card lenders to market on campus, it will not have a large effect on GUASFCU, according to Lo Iacono.
As the nation’s largest student-run credit union, with more than 11,000 total accounts, GUASFCU is different in that its members are shareholders who enjoy the company’s profits through lower banking fees, higher savings rates and lower loan rates, Lo Iacono said.
“GUASFCU does not currently offer an in-house credit card, so the legislation will not impact our organization,” Lo Iacono said. “GUASFCU will still be able to market on campus.”
Swagel said that the legislation could be positive or negative for student consumers, depending on their spending habits.
The act would make it more difficult for students to get a credit card, which might prevent irresponsible students from overspending, but it would also delay responsible spenders from building a positive credit score.
“Imagine someone who graduates at age 21 . and wants to rent an apartment. Having a credit card and having a credit history would make it easier to rent,” Swagel said. “That kind of building up a credit history and showing one’s financial responsibility – those are good things.”
But even with the provisions in the Credit CARD Act, it will not be enough to protect foolish spenders from falling into the credit trap, Swagel added.
“Someone who really wants to ruin themselves with debt, I guess, will still find a way,” Swagel said.
As an alternative to buying on credit, Lo Iacono said spend-wary students should use a debit card, which allows users to pull directly from an existing account, rather than delaying payment on a future bill.
“A debit card is a great way to manage one’s assets, especially since students can only spend the money in their account,” Lo Iacono said. “[This will help] them develop sound financial habits of not spending beyond their means.”
Representatives from the Chevy Chase Bank in Leavey Center were unable to be reached for comment.

The SFS Academic Council established a Map of the Modern World working group about two weeks ago, a move that followed earlier recommendations put forth in the council’s report on this year’s changes to the School of Foreign Service’s core requirement.
James Reardon-Anderson, senior associate dean and director of undergraduate programs in the SFS, introduced an overhaul of the Map of the Modern World course this academic year, modeling the course on the syllabus he followed when he taught the course at SFS-Qatar, and thereby shifting the course’s emphasis to the influence of physical and environmental factors on human, social and political organization.
According to Drew Peterson (SFS ’10), chairman of the working group, “[the SFSAC’s] report recommended the creation of a standing review panel for the purpose of examining the changes and how they fit into the broader context of an undergraduate education in the SFS.”
Peterson said that the initial report came in part as a result of students’ concerns regarding the changes to the course, which was formerly taught by Keith Hrebenak, professional lecturer in the SFS.
The working group represents efforts to gather student opinions on the new course, which will later be considered in conjunction with the viewpoints of administrators, professors, alumni and other members of the Georgetown community. The student members include three current SFS undergraduates as well as two SFS alumni.
“The working group is, in that respect, aimed at giving a voice to the community that has had the most exposure to geography education at Georgetown and has the greatest stake in its quality – the students,” Peterson said. “Alumni also provide a compelling perspective because they have the wisdom of hindsight and can offer understanding of how the education they received in Map has served them in their lives after graduation.”
The working group is currently in its first phase, in which its members are to review the syllabus and course materials, attend classes and gather reflections on the course from students, teaching assistants and others associated with the course in order to synthesize these sources into individual evaluations.
According to Peterson, the working group will hold its first meeting in April to integrate the panelists’ independent findings into a unified assessment of the new Map course. The working group will then meet with the course’s teaching assistants and then again with Dean Reardon-Anderson and potentially additional administrators. Upon completion of the meetings, the working group will publicize its conclusions and recommendations concerning the future of Map of the Modern World.
The student members of the working group include Peterson, Carlos Hernandez (SFS ’11), a member of The Hoya’s Board of Directors, and Kimberly Fernandes (SFS ’11). Frank Vargas (SFS ’06), a former TA and currently an emergency logistics planner at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Parag Khanna (SFS ’99), a fellow at the New America Foundation, comprise the alumni segment of the group.

Former Georgetown student William Thiele pleaded guilty in D.C. Superior Court Friday to carrying a pistol without a license and was sentenced to 18 months probation after he shot a toilet during Midnight Madness last October.
Thiele, who goes by Alex, will serve his probation in California, his home state. He must also give $100 to the District of Columbia’s Crime Victims Compensation Fund and is required by law to register as a gun offender in the District. He faced up to five years in prison and/or a $5,000 fine for the charge, which is a felony.
Should Thiele successfully complete his probation, his record will be cleared. The Federal Probation Service will set the terms of his probation upon his return to California; Thiele was scheduled to fly back to his home state on Saturday.
Thiele, who is no longer affiliated with Georgetown, said during the hearing that he planned to re-enroll in college in the fall, but he was not sure where.
Thiele was a freshman when, at about 10:20 p.m. on Oct. 16, 2009, he fired one shot from a handgun at a toilet in a men’s bathroom at McDonough Gymnasium while Midnight Madness was taking place in the same building. Thiele, who was intoxicated at the time, was arrested in Village C West about 40 minutes later.
According to police reports, the gun belonged to U.S. Park Police Officer Sherice Clanton, who was off duty in the gymnasium when her gun went missing. According to Thiele’s attorney, Mark Schamel, Clanton left her purse on the bleachers and turned around at one point to find the contents of the purse scattered and her gun missing.
Following a preliminary hearing in October, a judge ordered that Thiele be placed in his parents’ custody in California.

At the first-ever Georgetown University Student Association Budget Summit held Sunday by the GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee, the five advisory boards, the Georgetown Program Board and the GUSA Executive presented their budget proposals for fiscal year 2010.
Almost all groups present requested an increase in funding for the upcoming year, except for the Performing Arts Advisory Council, which requested the same amount as last year.
The total amount requested by all groups that receive funding from the Student Activities Fee exceeded the amount of funds available for Finance and Appropriations Committee allocation by $57,213.
Before the sweeping club funding reforms passed by the GUSA Senate in February took effect, the advisory boards, GPB and the members of the Finance and Appropriations Committee would meet to draft and vote on a budget for the upcoming year.
The legislation, which was passed on Feb. 8, stripped the advisory boards and GPB of their votes in the funding process and the allocation of the Student Activities Fee, requiring the boards to present their budgets separately in front of the seven members of the Finance and Appropriations Committee throughout the course of the day; the summit lasted from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
According to Sen. Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), a member of the Finance and Appropriations Committee, the committee plans to release a complete budget before spring break. After a period of public comment and appeals hearings, the senate will vote on the budget, after which it will go to the GUSA Executive for approval.
Most of the advisory boards receive their funding from a combination of the Student Activities Fee, which is a $50 fee that all students pay each semester, and funds from tuition money and the university’s contract with Coca-Cola. Some boards, such as Club Sports, receive almost all of their funding from the Student Activities Fee, while others, such as the Student Activities Commission, receive only a portion from the fee.
After each board presented its budget proposal, the committee reviewed a six-point funding reform plan with each of the groups, which required boards to hold open votes and meetings, lower excessive reserve funds through spending, implement an appeals process for groups dissatisfied with funding allocated, allow clubs to request lump-sum funding, increase accountability of advisory board members to their constituents and allow student organizations to retain any funds they raise autonomously.
Most of the boards were receptive to the reform plan and agreed to adopt at least some of the reform suggestions, including cutting down on reserve amounts by spending to the amount recommended by Associate Vice President Jeanne Lord of the Office of Student Affairs.
In order to reduce the amount of their budget request, the senate voted Sunday evening to transfer $150,000 from the GUSA Fund to the Student Activities Fee general reserve account, an action that reduced the amount of money the GUSA Fund can allocate for the year by half but increased the amount available to the advisory boards and the Georgetown Program Board and the Student Activities Commission for their budget proposals next year.
Representing the Student Activities Commission, the only group present that expressed firm opposition to the reforms, Chair Ethel Amponsah (NHS ’11) said that the changes to the club funding process would not allow SAC to operate properly.
Amponsah refused to consider open votes, citing the public’s sensitivity to the funding issues being addressed and SAC commissioners’ heavy involvement in the organizations they represent. She declined to put in place a concrete plan for reducing close to $215,000 in SAC reserves to the recommended amount of $150,000, stating a need for high reserves so that SAC could protect clubs from liabilities and contribute to capital improvements such as improving the quality of student space in spaces such as Riverside Lounge.
In response, the senators said it was unfair for SAC to diverge from the example of the other boards and to expect to be granted its requested funding, since the amount of money requested by clubs exceeded the amount available and most boards were willing to spend their reserve funds or had already significantly dug into their reserves to accommodate new goals.
“Money shouldn’t be going to boards that have enough fees to sustain themselves,” said Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair Nick Troiano (COL ’11).
On the topic of open votes, Amponsah was candid.
“There are small instances that become controversial and I won’t have commissioners’ names put next to votes,” she said.
All of the other boards, except for the Media Board, agreed to have open, published votes. The Finance and Appropriations Committee agreed to allow the Media Board to have closed votes because unlike the other boards, for which members submit applications and freely run for positions, each of the four major media outlets on campus choose a member of their organization to be their representative on the Media Board.
Malkerson said that the new reforms will increase fairness in the budget process, especially in a year in which the advisory boards requested more money than is available.
“Our votes are open and our meetings are public,” Malkerson said. “All of our actions will be scrutinized. We will be forced to defend any decision we make. This is a good thing. We should be able to stand by anything we do, and this is the same principle we are asking all the advisory boards to follow.”
During the summit, each board presented their budget proposal, which included a summary of past budgets for the prior two years, a written overview describing how the funding benefited students and any significant changes that impacted funding in the budget proposal.
Correction: This article originally stated that the GUSA Senate voted to transfer $150,000 from the GUSA Fund to the Student Activities Fee general reserve account. The senate voted to transfer $15,000.

Georgetown University’s undergraduate tuition will rise by 3 percent for the 2010-2011 academic year as the budget for undergraduate financial aid will increase by 8 percent, according to a university press release published yesterday.
“An increase was necessary in order to fund the rising operating costs of maintaining our facilities, supporting our faculty and enhancing our academic programs and services,” Andy Pino, director of media relations, said. “This increase is among the smallest percentile tuition increases of the last 40 years.”
The increase approved by the Board of Directors last year for the 2009-2010 academic year was 2.9 percent, which was the smallest percentile increase since 1973.
Current tuition for undergraduate students is $38,616, an amount that will increase to $39,768 next fall. The total cost to attend Georgetown as an undergraduate, including the average cost of room and board, which is set to increase by 2 percent under the new measures, will be $52,443.
“We understand that the lagging economy is having a real impact on our students and their families,” said University Provost James O’Donnell in the press release.
He added, “We expect the need for financial aid will continue to grow, and we are prepared to help.”
According to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon, this increase does not cause any concern for his office. Georgetown admits applicants based on a need-blind policy.
In November 2009, [Forbes listed Georgetown’s cost of attendance as the second most expensive in the country](https://saxaspeak.thehoya.com/2009/11/09/in-for-a-penny-in-for-a-pound/). Sarah Lawrence College was listed as the most expensive, with total cost at $55,788 a year.
“I think that a 3 percent [increase] is significant because we were already ranked number two in the list of most expensive colleges,” Ruiyong Chen (SFS ’13) said.
Graduate program tuition will also increase, according to the press release.
Some students said they believe that as long as the funds are used effectively, the tuition hike is permissible.
“If the increase is because of an increased demand for financial aid, then it’s understandable,” Ben Mishkin (SFS ’13) said. “The school should be committed to financial aid. As long as the increase is commensurate with other peer institutions, then it shouldn’t have an effect on the applications and admissions field.”

A new online service to be released this August by publishing giant MacMillan will provide professors with unprecedented control over textbook content for their classes.
Through a software called DynamicBooks, MacMillan will make many textbooks editable online and available to students in the altered version. Professors may change the order of chapters, paragraphs and even individual sentences without consulting the authors or publishers of the text. According to the DynamicBooks Web site, professors may also highlight text, upload links and comment on passages.
DynamicBooks’ Web site highlights many advantages to this technology, such as a reduced price tag compared to print versions. Students have editing tools as well, which allow for highlighting parts of the text and interactive learning through simulations, animations and self-tests.
Many students are excited by the opportunity for more interactive learning.
“I think professors including their own sentences in the text will allow students to be more engaged in the reading and really focus on the more important aspects of the chapters,” John Madore (COL ’11), a neurobiology major, said. “The online quizzes and animations should also help to focus studying and allow for faster mastery of the material.”
Other students agree that the interactive nature of the online text will be beneficial, but only for specific types of classes.
“I think these types of textbooks would be better suited for courses which deal with very dynamic fields of sciences,” Alex Tai (COL ’11), a biology major, said. “Though given the broad range of topics covered in introductory classes, it may make things too complicated for these classes.”
Although the idea of online editable text seems promising, past problems with the implementation of online software make some students question the functionality of these types of sites.
“I don’t really like the online textbook because the Web site is often down, and I have to constantly reload the pages,” said Bridget Dooley (NHS ’11), who uses an online simulation course with her pediatric nursing textbook.
Classmate Caroline Round (NHS ’11) agreed with Bridget’s sentiment.
“The combination of staring at the screen for hours, the Web site logging you out and general software malfunction makes the online textbook not only unhelpful but frustrating to use,” she said.
Matthew Hamilton, an associate professor in the biology department, does not find the text-editing feature of DynamicBooks useful. Hamilton has written his own textbook, “Population Genetics,” reviewed chapters for major introductory biology textbooks and is an adviser for the development of a new biology textbook.
He indicated that many texts are currently available in an e-book format that has many of the interactive features offered by DynamicBooks such as chapter reordering, online quizzes and other resources. The main difference between DynamicBooks and the e-books Hamiltion cited is that the text of these e-books is not alterable by an instructor. Hamilton indicated that the text modification feature seems unnecessary if a professor properly prepares his students to comprehend the material.
“I regularly give chapter supplements to students with clarifications and questions that help students with reading comprehension,” he said. “Do I need to have the publisher insert that in the text itself? Not really.”
Although it is too soon to determine the effectiveness or popularity of this software by either students or professors, this new service provided by DynamicBooks may possibly make its way on to campus next year as professors strive to enhance the classroom experience to adjust to technological trends.

After an 8.8 magnitude earthquake shook Chile at 3:34 a.m. local time Saturday, Anne Meriwether (COL ’11) was thankful to be in the safety of her bed and eager to let her family know she was out of harm’s way.
Meriwether, one of two Georgetown students studying abroad in the capital city of Santiago, was sleeping at the time of the earthquake and did not immediately realize the extent of the damage.
“As a safety precaution [the Chilean government] cut the power, so I didn’t have Internet, which is my primary way of communicating with my family,” Meriwether said. “I was afraid they’d hear the news before hearing from me and be really worried. I also didn’t have cell service for a while and couldn’t get in touch with anyone around here.”
Meriwether said she considers herself lucky that her apartment building did not sustain much damage and maintained access to water and power throughout most of the day.
“A lot of people I’ve talked to in the city and around it are without power and water, so I feel pretty lucky [and am] also thankful that my friends are all safe.”
Chilean student Nicole Jullian (SFS ’12), who expects to arrive in Santiago today to see her family, commented on the debilitating effects of the earthquake on her home country.
“The central regions of the country suffered a lot of infrastructural damage. Several buildings in Maipú – poorer area of the capital – collapsed, the airport has received considerable damage, and a couple bridges and highways are in very bad shape,” Jullian said in an e-mail. “Fortunately, Chile overall is used to having tremors and earthquakes, so the majority of buildings are designed to withstand seismic shifts, but then again 8.8 is really strong.”
Jullian was unable to contact her family for eight hours in the earthquake’s aftermath because of the power outages.
“People that lived closer to the epicenter are really traumatized by the whole event and many of them lost their homes,” Jullian said.
At press time, at least 723 people have been confirmed dead following the earthquake, according to CNN.
The two Georgetown students participating in the Council on International Educational Exchange study abroad program in Santiago, including Meriwether, were told to stay put and observe safety precautions when the earthquake struck.
According to Assistant Director in the Office of International Programs Magdalena Chica-Garzon, who advises for study abroad programs in Latin America, students studying in Santiago were nearing the end of orientation and were scheduled to start classes this or next week, though classes have now been delayed.
“CIEE students, including those from [Georgetown], are accounted for and are safe with their host families,” Chica-Garzon said.
Students participating in the CIEE program in Valparaíso were scheduled to arrive on-site yesterday; however, the start of the program has now been delayed until ground conditions are fully assessed and Universidad Católica de Valparaíso adjusts its academic calendar.
Chile has sought to recover amid aftershocks, and President Michelle Bachelet has said the country is in a “state of catastrophe.” The Chilean government first asked for foreign aid on Monday, according to The New York Times.
“Obviously the earthquake will have an impact on the economy,” said Barbara Kotschwar, adjunct professor of Latin American Studies. “I think it is early yet to be able to assess the impact on the infrastructure and the populace – but not nearly so much as, for example, in Haiti, as Chile has done much better in terms of meeting and enforcing building codes and planning for such a disaster. The fact that the quake hit so close to two major metropolitan areas increases the impact on the economy.”
Although restoration efforts will pose a challenge for the nation, Kotschwar noted that the Chilean government is very organized in its reponse and that it has established reliable bonds with other countries that will prove assets in the process.
“The professionals in charge of Chile’s trade promotion strategy work very closely with Chilean business and diplomats and forge close links and establish ties of trust with the local community,” Kotschwar said. “I am sure that this will help them garner targeted assistance of the type that could best help them in this case. I would look for some very well-organized initiatives very soon.”
An earthquake of this magnitude is capable of producing deadly tsunamis, such as the one that followed the Indian Ocean earthquake in 2004. This 8.8 magnitude quake, the epicenter of which was near the city of Concepción, south of Santiago, triggered tsunami warnings throughout Latin America and as far away as Hawaii, Japan, Australia and Russia.
Sierra Jansen (NHS ’11), originally from Maui, feared for the safety of her family in Hawaii.
“While my immediate family is not on-island, [Saturday] was a bit nerve-wracking,” Jansen said. “My family’s house is upcountry, thus our house was safe. However, many of my friends live near the beach and if anything had happened, everything would have been destroyed. I was just hoping that they were able to get to higher ground, especially those who lived in rural areas.”
Jansen said people prepared for the potential tsunami by stocking up on groceries and gasoline. “The tsunami sirens were going off and making everyone acutely aware of what they were waiting for. People who lived upcountry took in those who lived in the flood zone,” she said.
Due to the severity of the quake, CIEE, which operates the study abroad programs offered to Georgetown students, was unable to comment on the current state of its programs.”

*While most students easily grow accustomed to Georgetown’s campus, many never venture out into the community. Where campus tours are used to introduce prospective and new students to the campus, Beyond the Hilltop provides tours of areas outside the gates. Last fall, Matt Duffy (SFS ’10) founded the organization, which provides tours of Washington, D.C., to students and faculty that cost between $15 and $35 depending on length and area. He runs the company with Erin Kilbride (COL ’12) and Erin Claire (MSB ’12), and most of the profits are donated to cancer research. The company is filing to be recognized as a tax-exempt, nonprofit organization, and is constantly growing and expanding. The three students sat down with The Hoya to discuss the founding and growth of their new organization.*
 
**How was the company founded?**
 
 
 
D: I founded the company last semester, and it didn’t start out in its present reincarnation. It started out as just a tour company. I wanted to add a personal experience with cancer. I wanted to raise money to give back to a treatment center where my close family friend was treated, and so I thought that I didn’t have a lot of expertise.
 
 
 
But I kind of had some business expertise working at Midnight Mug and I had some expertise of living in D.C. because I lived here four years, so I thought I would combine the two of those together and start a tour company and see if that would work. And I just started telling friends about it and trying to get some materials together.
 
 
 
**Are there others involved in your business endeavor?**
 
 
 
EK: Right now we have a lot of potential tour guides – people who think it’s really cool and want to be involved in the founding and establishment in a 501 C3 [a tax-exempt, nonprofit organization]. We’re hoping that will feed into those who are really committed and will become officers and be in charge of the tour, be in charge of whatever new service that we do – but right now it’s us.
 
 
 
EC: With accepted students weekend coming up – I think the first GAAP weekend is in March – with the early admissions and also because we are filing as a 501 C3 with the government, we’re going to need a board of directors. So after spring break, we’ll begin doing the application process for that, looking for the board of directors.
 
 
 
**How many tours have you given so far?**
 
 
 
D: Four. All of them to Georgetown University professors, actually, who bought them for their freshmen and incoming students. One of them was chair of the linguistics department or some sort of coordinator in the linguistics department, he was actually the first one to buy a tour for incoming freshman linguistics students and then all linguistic students who might be interested.
 
 
 
**Where do you usually give the tours?**
 
 
 
D: It depends. The most popular location is Adams Morgan and U Street. We’ve also given tours in Eastern Market, and we proposed a tour but never actually gave it to the Open Air Fish Market, which is down south of the Food and Drug Administration [building]. The tours are supposed to be personalized. The information on D.C. is out there – you can go to the library and do research, we can do a tour of anywhere anyone wants to go. But those are the areas that have been popular so far. Adams Morgan is especially one of them.
 
 
 
**Why do you donate the money to cancer research?**
 
 
 
D: That was, I guess, my personal choice when I first started, just personal opinions, personal connections that I had to cancer research that I wanted to give back to. That’s what started the idea. So that was an impetus.
 
 
 
EK: I think the cool thing is that as more services are founded and students come up with their own ways to generate money in a really sustainable and effective way, they can decide where that money goes. So if they have something that is really close to them, if it’s a different kind of cause, whether it be [for] education or whatever it is, then they channel money from their own service that they’ve started into that. That’s why I wanted to get involved, and why I thought that it was really cool. Because it’s not just, `I want to save the world, but I don’t have any money to do it,’ . it’s a really effective way to get involved.
 
 
 
EC: We’re starting with Beyond the Hilltop. So the tours will generate money, sustainable money that we know is coming in. We can count on the revenues, and then we give that money to charity – for these tours it’s to [benefit] cancer research and other services can be to other organizations. The plan is that 70 percent of the money from the tours goes to cancer research and the other 30 percent will be saved for starting new services, other ideas that students come up with. So obviously the growth is exponential because if each service follows this model, you have more services contributing their 30 percent of the profits, which gives more money to start new services, and the growth is huge.
 
 
 
**What kind of response have you received since you started?**
 
 
 
D: We’ve gotten a lot of great responses … We just gave a tour this weekend, a free sample tour, and I could tell that there was one girl on it who was kind of hesitant to the idea but by the end, she was like, `This is the coolest thing I’ve ever done. I should’ve checked out Adams Morgan before.’ We went and got tamales afterward and it was just a really fun experience. I think people start out [hesitantly] because they go, `Here’s a student telling me about a different area,’ but I think it’s the city itself that really wins them over. And just people who are getting involved, like you said it’s commendable, I think a lot of people recognize the potential of something like this, and they’re excited by it.
EK: It’s fun because it’s a fellow student. You’re not getting a tour from someone wearing a dorky jacket and telling you stuff about what you don’t really care about – about D.C. They’re like, `This is a cool place that I went when I was a sophomore.’ It’s just a really fun, Georgetown student perspective of what is going on beyond our little Healy gates.”

On March 26, the Whiting-Turner Contracting Company will receive Craftsmanship Awards for its work on the Rafik B. Hariri Building from the Washington Building Congress.
In addition to the Craftsmanship Awards it won last year for work completed in 2008, the Rafik B. Hariri Building “will receive awards for its ornamental and glass railing work in the Simone McDonough Atrium and Lohrfink Auditorium by Tate Ornamental; the woodwork in the atrium, auditorium and case rooms completed by Fetzer Architectural Woodwork; the terrazzo floor and steps in the atrium completed by David Allen; and the painting and wall-covering work throughout the building completed by Precision Wall Tech,” according to a press release on the McDonough School of Business’s Web site.
The Washington Building Congress, a commercial trade association that has been holding its Craftsmanship Awards annually since 1950, is not alone in recognizing the new building’s merit. Many members of the Georgetown community appreciate its innovative design and use of space.
Patricia Fairfield, associate professor in the MSB, said she enjoys the new variety of classrooms and study spaces, which includes 15 classrooms, 34 breakout rooms, 15 conference rooms, 11 interview rooms, a 400-seat auditorium, two large lounges and 120 offices for faculty members.
“I like the case style classrooms – it makes it easier to interact with the students,” Fairfield said in an e-mail. “It is [also] great for the students to have so much space to hold group meetings and to study.”
Many students cite the glass atrium as their favorite part of the building for a variety of reasons.
“Unlike Lauinger [Library], the new business school building has a much brighter feel because of its open atrium and the fact that it has lots of windows letting in natural light,” Kaitlyn Neuberger (SFS ’10) said.
“My favorite part of the business school building is the auditorium on the fourth floor, since the glass walls showcase beautiful views of Georgetown,” Kelly Skowera (COL ’13) said. “I especially loved studying in the business school around finals time,” she added, mentioning the difficulty in finding open study space when the library is full.
Other students said they appreciate the unprecedented technological features of the 179,000-square foot structure, including data ports, flat-screen monitors, videoconferencing capabilities and Wi-Fi in the breakout rooms and lounges around the building.
“It’s the most modern building on campus, and the classrooms are second to none,” Jonathan Rabar (MSB ’13) said in an e-mail. “It was $82.5 million well spent.”
