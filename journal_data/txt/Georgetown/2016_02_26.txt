Boosted by a $10 million donation from the Braman family, Georgetown University officially launched the Center for Jewish Civilization, announced by University President John J. DeGioia in a campus-wide email Wednesday.
The CJC serves as an interdisciplinary teaching and research unit within the School of Foreign Service, with a focus on Jewish history, culture and civilization. The center will replace the Program for Jewish Civilization, which was originally launched in September 2003 under the leadership of Rabbi Harold White in an effort to promote an increased understanding of Jewish civilization at the university.
CJC Director Jacques Berlinerblau, who previously led the PJC, said the center will act to facilitate the study of Jewish civilization on campus.
“We see ourselves as a hub. We want to encourage and make possible the study of Judaism on the Georgetown campus, and we view ourselves almost as like the convener,” Berlinerblau said.
The center is the result of 12 years of a fundraising effort by Georgetown faculty and administrators, in which the university raised almost $11 million in endowed funds for the center from more than 500 families, and another $10 million from the Braman family to establish the Braman Endowed Professorship of the Practice of the Forensic Study of the Holocaust, a new position within the center that will be filled by Rev. Patrick Desbois, previously an adjunct professor.
The Braman family is personally connected to the study of Jewish civilization and the Holocaust, as donor Norman Braman of Miami, Fla., is the son of Holocaust survivors.
“I have decided to make this gift, now, and to Georgetown, in part as a sign of my appreciation for the leadership of Pope Francis and the priority he so clearly attaches to fostering closer relations between
Jews and Catholics,” Braman wrote in a statement to The Washington Post.
The center will primarily focus on American-Middle Eastern foreign policy as it pertains to Israel, the Holocaust and genocide and Jewish literature.
According to Berlinerblau, the focus on American-Middle Eastern foreign policy is a result of the center’s setup in the SFS.
“The first initiative, because we were in the SFS, is we wanted to become the pre-eminent school in the world that studied American-Middle Eastern foreign policy as it pertained to Israel,” Berlinerblau said. “And that of course implies that we have to also know about energy policy, oil prices, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, that’s all enfolded within Middle Eastern geopolitics.”
Berlinerblau said the university has made strides in the field of Middle Eastern studies in recent years by hiring professors such as Ambassador Dennis Ross, former Deputy National Security Advisor Elliott Abrams and Michael Oren before he became Israeli ambassador to the United States.
The center will focus heavily on research into the Holocaust, in part through the work of Desbois, according to Vice President for Advancement Bart Moore.
“It’s based on Fr. Desbois’ groundbreaking research that has established the full extent and murderous impact the Nazi’s ruthlessly effective mobile killing squad that was used in East-Central and East Europe to kill previously uncounted tens of thousands of people, in places where they did not have established concentration camps,” Moore said.
Berlinerblau said the CJC will provide a center for the experience of Jewish culture and Judaism’s role in Georgetown’s campus life.
“I would say there was a perception in the Jewish community prior to Jack DeGioia creating the CJC that Georgetown was at best indifferent and at worst not really interested at all in Jewish civilization, and whether it was right or wrong, that perception existed,” Berlinerblau said. “Well that perception doesn’t exist anymore, because everyone sees Georgetown as a friend, as an asset, as a neighbor and everything is good here.”
Moore said it has always been important to the university to increase education about Judaism.
“Fr. Healy often spoke publicly about the importance of any great university knowing and teaching the intellectual, religious and cultural traditions of the Jewish people, and I think it was, in part, a desire to complete a project initiated by Fr. Healy that this became so important to President DeGioia,” Moore said.
Berlinerblau said establishing the CJC helps ensure that the center’s work is on an equal and long-lasting footing.
“But also there is a solidity, a perpetuity, since this is $21 million of endowed money, we now know that we’re around forever,” Berlinerblau said.
According to Berlinerblau, the CJC also hopes to establish a major and master — a major in the college in Jewish civilization and a master’s program in Holocaust studies — at the university. Berlinerblau said a master’s program could be formed in two years, while the CJC is ready to move ahead with developing a major this year once it receives approval from the administration.
“We’re locked, ready, loaded and ready to go, and we need to see if we get pushback, but generally Georgetown is good with these things so I would hope that by the end of this semester we have a signal from Chet that this is something he wants to explore,” Berlinerblau said.
Moore said donors appreciated Georgetown’s commitment to Judaism.
“I think there’s a great appreciation for the respect that the university is paying to the Jewish people and their history and culture and tradition and religion by making it a priority in President DeGioia’s presidency that we have a properly funded, permanently endowed center dedicated to Jewish studies,” Moore said.
John Davison (GSB ’87), who donated to help establish the PJC in 2003 and then the CJC, said the reasons behind his donations have changed over the past 12 years.
“I feel like I’m no longer giving to something to alleviate a problem, I’m giving to something to make the center more substantial and to attract greater teaching talent, would be how my perspective has changed,” Davison said.
Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner added that there is a significant level of interest for Jewish education on campus.
“From my perspective as the rabbi on this campus, I can say that there is a thirst for more Jewish knowledge in our Jewish student community and there is an interest in learning about Judaism among students from other backgrounds as well,” Gartner said. “So I think this center serves a need and will be met with terrific enthusiasm among the students.”
Professor Ori Soltes said he was excited about the prospect of expanding the understanding of Jewish civilization at a Catholic university.
“All those kinds of cross-communications that the greater visibility will hopefully make it even more effective as an instrument to serve that purpose, from at least the angle of Judaism and its relation to Catholicism, Christianity at large, Islam and what have you,” Soltes said.
Maddy Budman (COL ’18), a GUish intern at Georgetown University Campus Ministry, wrote in an email to The Hoya that she hopes the center will help advance the curriculum relating to Jewish studies.
“I hope that the center launch will bring more attention to the CJC, leading us to things like a better physical office space and more administrative support,” Budman wrote. “I’ve seen a shift recently in the PJC from purely Israel-Palestine and Holocaust classes to literature and theology and more creative humanities classes, and I think that the center launch will help encourage the continuing of this diversity in curriculum.”
Adam Shinbrot (COL ’18), who is a member of the Georgetown Israel Alliance and Alpha Epsilon Pi, wrote in an email to The Hoya that he is also excited for the center.
“I think that the launching of the CJC will promote Jewish life on campus for both Jews and non-Jews. At a school like Georgetown, I think that offering students a way to learn about Judaism, anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, and Israel (although the Holocaust and Israel can be seen in a “non-Jewish context”) is the best way to promote Jewish life and allow students to engage in Semitic studies,” Shinbrot wrote.

In light of this year’s rise in protests on college campuses nationwide, the University of California at Los Angeles’ annual campus survey, “The American Freshman,” found the highest number of students who said they expected to participate in protests in the 50 years since the report’s conception.
The survey, a national study of the American higher education system, which began in 1966, is conducted in the fall by UCLA’s Cooperative Institutional Research Program of the Higher Education Research Institute. For this year’s report, “The American Freshman” was conducted at 200 universities, including Georgetown, with around 140,000 participants. Universities were self-selecting, and the survey only applied to freshmen.
In 2014, 5.6 percent of students stated that they were likely to participate in a student rally while in college. That number jumped to 8.5 percent of students in 2015, an all-time high. Black students surveyed were most likely to participate in a protest — with one out of six responding affirmatively. Areas of particular interest for students include high tuition costs, race, student debt and sexual assault.
Additionally, students’ political inclinations have shifted. A third of students identifies as liberal or far left, the most since 1973. Approximately one in five said they were conservative or far right, a decline from one in four in 2006. Of all students surveyed, 60 percent indicated they were likely to vote, an increase of 10 percent from last year’s findings.
Reported interest in global involvement along with a desire to help others has also increased sharply., with 74.6 percent of students stating that helping others was a personal objective, 39.8 percent responding that becoming a community leader was an essential life objective and 59.2 percent stating they aimed to deepen their understanding of other countries and cultures.
CIRP Director Kevin Eagan said the findings are an indication of increased student community engagement.
“What’s encouraging to me and what was somewhat surprising, given how drastically these numbers increased, is just a genuine interest students seemed to be taking in the world around them, and in particular issues affecting their local community,” Eagan said.
Eagan added that though the report indicates a rise in interest in campus student protests in the coming years, this does not necessarily indicate that students will act on these interests.
“I think that having an interest in these kind of issues is one thing, and I will be very interested in following these students during their college careers to understand whether any of these interests actually lead to action,” Eagan said. “Given that the students tell us that they’re incoming freshmen, that they were very likely or they thought they were very likely to protest in college, do those students actually end up going to participate in a protest while in college?”
College campuses across the country saw student demonstrations this past fall, including the University of Missouri, Harvard University, Yale University, Ithaca College and Claremont McKenna College.
At Georgetown, students organized a rally and a sit-in outside the Office of the President in November 2015 in solidarity with University of Missouri students, who began protesting against racial injustices at their institution last September. One day after the sit-in began, the Georgetown Board of Directors and President John DeGioia approved the renaming of Mulledy and McSherry Halls to Freedom Hall and Remembrance Hall, respectively.
Additionally, DeGioia proposed an African American studies department and major as well as a center for racial injustice research Feb. 4, addressing some of the demands of the students who conducted the sit-in.
Georgetown’s Black Student Alliance member Symone Wilson (COL ’19), who took part in last fall’s sit-in, said protests are more effective in initiating action than conventional discourse.
“If you just talk and talk and talk and never do anything and never exert pressure on the authorities, which you want to change, they will take it that you’re not serious and that they can disregard your demands,” Wilson said. “So I think that protests are super effective.”
Wilson cited the rally and sit-in as an example of a protest that successfully facilitated change.
“The Working Group on Slavery and Reconciliation at Georgetown, which had been in effect for a couple of months, they had had meetings and promised to change the names of things like Mulledy Hall, but it hadn’t happened yet,” Wilson said. “But then after the sit-ins at the president’s office, a day afterwards, the names were changed.”
Campbell James (SFS ’17), president of GU Pride, which hosted a solidarity event during the counter-protests against Westboro Baptist Church last April, emphasized the importance of campus protests as a means of making positive progress.
“Protests are fantastic ways of gaining attention for a specific cause if students have a plan of action that they want to implement already, not just protesting campus climate without something to change,” James said.
Charles Johnson (SFS ’19), member of Georgetown University Fossil Free, which has organized numerous protests for university divestment from fossil fuels over the past year, agreed that protesting garners the attention of administrators, an important component of enacting change. Johnson highlighted this as a central aim of GUFF’s annual Earth Day rally held in April.
“We definitely feel that this rally will have a tangible effect in getting our message across to the administration,” Johnson said. “Whenever students are showing to be in solidarity it definitely makes the administration feel like they have more incentive to actually act in the best interest of the students.”

United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict Zainab Bangura advocated for the increased participation of women in international affairs and presented strategies to combat sexual violence in conflict zones during an address in Gaston Hall on Monday.
The Office of the President, the Institute for Women, Peace and Security, the Global Futures Initiative and the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs hosted Bangura. During the event, Bangura also received the Hillary Rodham Clinton Award for Advancing Women in Peace and Security, an award established by GIWPS and Clinton in 2014, during the event. The New York Times Paris Bureau Chief Alissa Rubin moderated the discussion.
Bangura began her conversation by outlining her role in the U.N. and her work addressing the misconception of sexual violence as an unavoidable consequence in conflicts.
“My mission is to make sure sexual violence is no longer sidelined as a stigma to be borne in silence but is brought into the center of international relations,” Bangura said. “We all know that rape in war is as old as war itself. Historically the issue has been framed as a byproduct of war — merely collateral damage and simply boys being boys.”
Bangura argued that sexual violence is used deliberately by terrorist organizations as a means to control and subjugate local populations during conflicts. Bangura said such violence is a form of terror that is ineffectively addressed by institutions seeking to combat terrorist groups.
“When we think of terrorism, we tend to think of destruction, killing, kidnapping and abduction. Rape and other forms of sexual violence are not mentioned in any national counterterrorism [agendas],” Bangura said.
Sexual violence is also used to instill fear in conflict-torn communities. Bangura said women and girls in contemporary conflicts often find themselves constantly under assault, whether at border crossings, checkpoints or in places where they seek refuge. She cited examples of atrocities committed by military forces in South Sudan.
“For instance, in South Sudan in July 2015 military offenses by the national army resulted in at least 30 women and girls being raped, gang-raped and burned alive in their homes. One survivor of this atrocity reported to the United Nations, ‘If you look them in the eye when they are doing it they will kill you,’” Bangura said.
Bangura highlighted the multitude of current global conflicts in regions ranging from the Middle East to Africa to South Asia.
“More than 30 active armed conflicts, levels of civilian displacements not seen since the second world war … threatens to stall or even reverse the progress of recent decades towards the developments in human rights,” Bangura said. “In addition, war has unleashed a wave of sexual violence, sexual slavery, forced marriage and trauma both to individual and collective that will take generations to heal.”
Bangura said she recognizes the atrocities of sexual crimes at a global level and understands the long road ahead in the process of healing and remediating ongoing sexual violence.
“Against this bleak backdrop, my mandate to steer a global effort to end the scourge of conflict-related sexual violence has become more urgent than ever,” Bangura said.
“Over many months and years of working on this issue it has become crystal clear to me there can be no security without women’s security and no peace without peace of mind for women and their families.”
Bangura visited the Middle East in April 2015, and since her trip she has formulated a multifaceted strategy to combat sexual violence in the region. Bangura expressed hope about recent progress made to fight sexual violence on a global level.
“Over the past five years, we have seen a dramatic evolution in serious [attempts to combat] conflict-related sexual violence including by security stakeholders [and] military institutions,” Bangura said. “To date, over 2,000 survivors of sexual violence have received reparations, including economic compensation, rehabilitation, land restitution [and] employment opportunities.”
Bangura concluded by emphasizing the important role women must play in international relations to ensure their own security.
“It is also clear to me that women’s protection is indivisible from their participation in peace, security and justice processes. Wartime rape has been a condition of history because women have never held the pen with which official records of war and peace are written,” Bangura said.
Rachel Palmer (GRD ’15) said she appreciated Bangura’s past and current efforts to bring the issue of sexual violence to the international community. She hoped attendees understood the unsatisfactory attention the issue receives at both domestic and international levels.
“It’s people like Zainab who have been pushing and pushing and pushing against all odds and against an international community, against domestic communities that don’t believe that rape is actually a strategic move,” Palmer said.
Rebecca Marrow (SFS ’16), who also attended the event, said Bangura’s explanation of sexual violence used as a method to instill fear in populations is still not as accepted and discussed in the international community as it should be.
“I still don’t think we adequately address the fact that rape and sexual violence toward women in times of war is not just an ugly byproduct of violence; it is a systematic systemic tool used frequently and purposefully and I think that’s something we’re very easily blind and deaf to,” Marrow said.
Miranda Tafoya (SFS ’18) also praised Bangura’s talk, adding that she hoped communities will continue to address the fact that women still lack a voice when it comes to sexual violence.
“The main thing that I took away was that these stories aren’t really told because women don’t get to hold the pen,” Tafoya said. “Women don’t get a lot of agency in sharing their stories with the world, and [Bangura] said that women need to have a bigger role in telling these stories of peace and these stories of war so that you can hear all sides of the story.”

Georgetown University Law Center Dean of Admissions Andrew Cornblatt announced that the center’s Early Assurance Program will not be terminated, but instead continued under a modified format, at an event hosted by the Pre-Law Society in White-Gravenor Hall on Wednesday.
Since 1984, GULC has allowed Georgetown undergraduate students to apply to the law school during the spring of their junior year without having to first take the Law School Admission Test, a standardized exam used by many law schools in the admissions process. In past years, the program typically accepted 15 to 20 students from an applicant pool of up to 60 students.
The Cawley Career Education Center initially announced the GULC’s termination of the program in an email Jan. 20, stating that Georgetown students would now need to apply to the law school along with the general applicant pool. However, in a letter sent to undergraduate students Feb. 25, Cawley Career Center Pre-Law Advisor Victoria Turco said the program will continue, with one key change to the testing requirements.
“Georgetown juniors may apply to the Law Center without taking the LSAT, but must submit their ACT or SAT scores. Admissions decisions will be made without an LSAT score, as has been the case since the program was instituted in 1984,” Turco wrote. “However, admitted students must sit for the LSAT and submit their scores to the Law Center prior to matriculation. While students are now required to take the LSAT prior to entering the Law Center, the actual LSAT score will not be grounds for revoking an acceptance that was extended pursuant to this program.”
As before, students may apply March of their junior years and will be notified of decisions by late April.
At the event Wednesday, Cornblatt explained to prospective applicants that he fought to maintain the Early Assurance Program in its original form, but that the ultimate compromise with the American Bar Association was to require all accepted students to take the LSAT before matriculation.
“The ABA is making us have you take the LSAT. They are making us do that. I can’t get around that anymore,” Cornblatt said. “I fought the good fight, I promise. I was by your side, you were by my side.”
Cornblatt noted that Georgetown’s program had originally begun to encounter difficulties five to eight years ago when other schools began emulating its structure by accepting students without taking into account their LSAT scores.
According to Cornblatt, this allowed law schools to prevent their students’ LSAT results – which were possibly lower than those desired – from being counted in annual considerations made to determine the U.S. News and World Report Law School rankings. The ABA eventually realized many schools were using this system to boost their rankings.
Because Georgetown’s program was created three years before the U.S. News and World Report Rankings existed, Cornblatt said it could not have been designed to cheat the system.
“We could not be gaming the system – there was no system to game. There were no rankings then, that’s not why we did it,” Cornblatt said.
Cornblatt emphasized his resolve in continuing the program, noting that he brought evidence of its effectiveness to the ABA five years ago in an effort to defend it after other universities started imitating it. The ABA allowed the program to continue, provided Georgetown could prove its necessity and usefulness on a year-to-year basis. Cornblatt did not elaborate on whether or not other institutions were able to similarly negotiate their programs.
Cornblatt placed the responsibility of the decision on the ABA, underscoring GULC’s continuous attempts to act in students’ interests.
“Understand they wanted us to be done and we didn’t want to be done. Believe me, we are the good guys in this,” Cornblatt said. “We kept trying to talk to them about this and then they shut this thing down.”
Cornblatt emphasized that the modification of the program should have a negligible effect on potential applicants, with the exception that they will now be obligated to sit for the LSAT.
“The program is in place and alive and well,” Cornblatt said. “Nothing has really changed from your point of view except in the end you have to take the test.”
GULC now risks seeing a lower median LSAT score and as a consequence, an effect on its ranking because of the newly implemented changes. However, Cornblatt said GULC is willing to make this sacrifice, and expressed confidence that current undergraduate students at Georgetown will still perform highly.
“I think that’s a small price to pay, number one,” Cornblatt said. “Number two, I think because it’s Georgetown, because it’s your law school, I figure you guys, you may not maybe get intense about it. That’s okay with me. I don’t blame you a bit, but you’re not going to blow it off. I hope you won’t do that, but I think for your own pride you’ll want to do as well as you can.”
Roey Hadar (SFS ’18) said that though he was disappointed upon receiving news of the program’s discontinuance, he was hopeful after hearing Cornblatt speak.
“The pre-law program was actually part of the reason why I chose Georgetown and it was very disheartening to read the original email, but it was definitely encouraging to hear that the program is just being only slightly marginally changed,” Hadar said.
Anne Marie Hawley (COL ’19), who is also considering applying to the program, said she was happy to see the care taken by the law center to clarify the initial announcement.
“Hearing that the people at the law school really care about the students here and keeping the pipeline is good to know,” Hawley said.
Prospective applicant Aaron Silberman (SFS ’18) expressed his appreciation of the directness with which Cornblatt addressed student concerns and emphasized that this news will bring relief to prospective applicants.
“I think the talk was engaging, and I appreciate the veracity with which he approached this issue,” Silberman said.

Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. took center stage at the Third Annual Dean’s Lecture to the graduating class at the Georgetown University Law Center this Tuesday, where he discussed topics ranging from career advice to the vacant Supreme Court seat.
Alito did not address the heated debate among Georgetown law professors and students surrounding late Justice Antonin Scalia’s legacy.
Alito completed his undergraduate degree at Princeton University before attending Yale Law School. GULC Dean William Treanor moderated the conversation.
“I am absolutely delighted that today we will be hearing from Justice Alito. It should be a great treat,” Treanor said in his introduction. “Particularly as a New Jersey native I am delighted that another New Jersey native is joining us.”
GULC constitutional law professor Randy Barnett formally introduced Alito and stressed the event’s importance as a means of providing guidance to the graduating class.
“The purpose of the conversation that you are going to hear today, as it has been in prior years, is to provide the graduating class with guidance from someone who stood where you now sit, and are thinking about how to use his or her own legal education to make a difference,” Barnett said. “As you prepare to embark on your own careers, there could be no better person to share how his values have shaped his own experiences, is today’s honored guest, Justice Samuel Alito.”
Alito emphasized in his remarks the shock that he and the rest of the Supreme Court felt upon learning of Scalia’s Feb. 13 passing. His comments offered the public an early look into the inner workings of the court since Scalia’s death.
“What’s happened in the last week has been a great shock to us,” Alito said. “We just started back in business hearing arguments yesterday. We’ll see what develops.”
With the prospect of an eight-member bench for a contentious Supreme Court term approaching, the justices are set to hear cases on abortion, union rights and affirmative action. Although a four-to-four decision results in automatic deference to the lower court’s decision and does not set legal precedent, Alito noted that the Supreme Court has functioned well in the past with an even number of justices, including during the early 1970s and in the late 1980s. Alito joked that there may even have been less discord within the entity.
“We will deal with it,” Alito said. “There’s nothing in the Constitution that specifies the size of the Supreme Court. There were times in the history of the court when the court had an even number of justices. They must have been more agreeable in those days.”
When asked directly, Alito declined to speculate on who President Barack Obama would nominate to succeed Scalia, instead emphasizing that as a Supreme Court justice, he has enough on his plate that demands his judgment.
“We don’t choose our colleagues. The presidents choose the justices and the judges and the Senate confirms them,” Alito said. “I have enough trouble with the questions that I have to decide.”
Alito also spoke to the graduating class about his experiences throughout law school and early in his legal career, the confirmation process in the U.S. Senate and his nomination to the Supreme Court by President George W. Bush in 2005.
“The one piece of advice that I give to law students or undergraduates that are thinking about going to law school is that they should get to know what lawyers really do,” Alito said.
Other topics brushed on Alito’s self-declared originalist philosophy, an ideology to which Scalia was also famous for adhering.
“I do think the Constitution means something,” Alito said. “I think that meaning does not change. I think it means the same thing now as it did when it was adopted.”
When speaking about his time working for the U.S. Attorney’s Office under Maryanne Trump-Barry, the sister of current presidential candidate Donald Trump, Alito showed off his sense of humor.
“She’s a very good friend,” Alito said. “Whether she’s like her brother or not, I won’t get into.”
Following Alito’s remarks, he answered questions submitted by graduating law students that focused on the relationships between justices and his vision for the nomination of the future Supreme Court justice.
Laya Varansi (LAW ’17) said that she was inspired by Alito’s comments on his legal career, adding that she found them relatable to the concerns of law students who are soon to graduate.
“It was really great to see how his career trajectory took him to where he is. It was inspirational in a lot of ways because I know a lot of students here, we have short-term aspirations, but we don’t necessarily know where it is going to lead us,” Varansi said. “For somebody like him to have such a similar story to how we are feeling — it’s really inspirational, and leads us to believe that we could end up there too.”
Bridget Stubblefield (LAW ’17) echoed Varanisi’s sentiments.
“It’s always such an honor to hear any of the justices come and talk to us in such a personal space,” Stubblefield said.

The Georgetown University Student Association President- and Vice President-elect Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Chris Fisk (COL ‘17) will form an unofficial Greek Council to connect student government and the university’s unrecognized fraternities and sororities. According to Khan, the council will be a common meeting place for Greek organizations to communicate, exchange ideas and organize co-sponsorship activities.
“Because Greek life isn’t recognized, it’s tough to coordinate between the different Greek organizations,” Khan said. “What we see is that there’s a really common trend with objectives that different organizations on campus have and it’s tough to organize certain efforts or commitments to service our community when they are disjointed.”
The formation of the council is part of GUSA’s overall goal to support unrecognized student groups on campus. Past efforts to support unrecognized groups include the addition of dedicated storage space for unrecognized groups in Regents Hall, updated classroom reservations and available printing services in November 2014 under the administration of former GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15).
The council, which will form in March, will most likely consist of two representatives from each Greek organization, along with GUSA representatives in a supporting role.
Executive Officer of the senate Kotryna Jukneviciute (COL ’18), who served as co-director of outreach and chaired Greek policy on the Khan-Fisk campaign, is leading efforts to create the council.
Jukneviciute, who is a sister in Kappa Kappa Gamma, said the goal of the council is not to consolidate the different Greek organizations, but instead to open a forum for collaboration.
“This is going to be a place for them to just share ideas and support each other and each other’s efforts,” Jukneviciute said. “If one organization is hosting an event for example, it’d be a great way for other organizations to find out about it and support each other and increase turnout.”
Khan said GUSA would play a role in the council by supporting the organizations and offering assistance when needed. The benefits GUSA has provided to unrecognized student groups on campus include printing, tabling and booking rooms
“A big part of what GUSA would be there for is to highlight the fact that the student body recognizes the existence of Greek life and what we’re there for is a resource, in terms of co-sponsorship, which is a way to gain access to certain benefits,” Khan said.
GUSA Secretary of Campus Planning Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), who was co-director of policy for Khan and Fisk’s campaign and worked alongside Jukneviciute on Greek policy, said another goal of the council is to foster a culture of respect around Greek life.
“They don’t want recognition but they do want respect, and I think that they deserve respect especially given that almost a thousand students are in Greek life on campus,” Goldstein said.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson reaffirmed Georgetown’s opposition to Greek life in a campus-wide email in September.
“And as you make these decisions, we want you to be aware that Georgetown does not support a social Greek system; social fraternities and sororities are not eligible for access to University benefits and do not have University oversight,” Olson wrote.
Goldstein, who also is a brother in Alpha Epsilon Pi, said GUSA is committed to sending out an email in response to Olson’s email at the beginning of the 2016 academic year.
“Enushe and Chris are committed to sending out an email after that saying that we represent students and that means every student, and if you choose to join a Greek organization, we support you in that choice as an individual,” Goldstein said.
Khan said the council would align with Georgetown University’s values and show university administration the positive philanthropic activities in which Greek life organizations participate.
“What you see is that almost all of these organizations’ objectives are very much in line with what Georgetown University as an institution supports and likes to maintain amongst its student body,” Khan said. “So one thing is helping these organizations exist without unnecessary interference from the administration.”
President of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity Devin Baker (MSB ’17), who has yet to decide if SigEp will join the council, said GUSA’s efforts serve an important role if the council’s mission lines up with the fraternity’s values and practices.
“I think there is a level where everyone benefits, but we all are different and we stand for things that others don’t,” Baker said. “We all stand for generally good things but again, we operate differently.”
Kappa Kappa Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta and Alpha Phi Omega denied requests for comment as of press time.

Georgetown University will partner with the United Nations HeForShe campaign and pursue initiatives to advance gender equality on its campus and in society, University President John J. DeGioia announced at a launch event Tuesday.
HeForShe is an international movement that encourages men and boys to advocate for gender equality. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and U.N. Women Global Goodwill Ambassador Emma Watson launched the campaign in 2014.
In a university statement, DeGioia wrote that Georgetown is proud to support HeForShe and its mission.
“Georgetown is proud to stand with HeForShe and its work to empower women and girls worldwide,” DeGioia wrote. “Many in our world community, and especially women, are faced with significant challenges to the basic right to social justice and to the conditions that allow for human flourishing.”
As a partner, the university will use its Institute for Women, Peace and Security to publish and exhibit articles on issues that relate to peace and security studies, launch a new study on the impact of women’s roles in resolving political conflict and pursuing sustainable peace and expand its international consortium, which brings together academics and peace workers.
Georgetown will also strengthen its response to sexual assault issues on campus using information gathered from this year’s campus climate survey and expand its sexual assault prevention training programs as part of the partnership, such as “I Am Ready,” “Think About It” and “RESPECT.”
Finally, Georgetown will encourage an academic and professional culture tailored to promoting female students, faculty, staff and alumni through the Georgetown Women’s Alliance.
DeGioia wrote in a university press release that Georgetown has a responsibility to work to improve gender equality.
“Universities have the unique capacity — and responsibility — to both model a commitment to gender equality within our own campus communities and to contribute to the movement globally through research and public discourse,” DeGioia wrote.
Executive Director of U.N. Women and leader of the HeForShe Initiative Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka spoke about Georgetown’s role as a champion for gender equality at the event Tuesday.
“Universities have the intellectual power, vision and optimism necessary to achieve gender equality,” Mlambo-Ngcuka said.
Georgetown was one of the only two U.S. universities selected, along with Stony Brook University in New York. Corporate partners include Twitter, Barclays and Tupperware Brands.
Jonathan Dromgoole (SFS ’16), who attended the event, wrote in the press release that he is proud to see Georgetown support the movement.
“I am proud to say that I am a HeForShe,” Dromgoole wrote. “Georgetown’s commitment to gender equality and the HeForShe campaign illustrates the university’s understanding of the importance of not just being men and women for others but humans for others.”

The Georgetown University African American studies program brought together scholars and activists to shed light on civil rights leader Malcolm X’s influence on racial and gender equality in Copley Formal Lounge on Monday.
The Black History Month event, titled “Malcolm X Through the Feminist Lens,” featured department of African American studies Chair Kimberly Brown, professorial lecturer Emerald Christopher-Byrd, Chair of critical race, gender and culture studies at American University Theresa Runstedlter and Black Lives Matter co-founder Erika Totten. Assistant professor of sociology Leslie Hinkson moderated the discussion.
Totten began the discussion by outlining how Malcolm X inspired her own dedication to addressing racial injustice.
“His legacy to me is one of defiance, body exposing the insidiousness of white supremacy and the DNA of America, and making that knowledge accessible to the most marginalized folks,” Totten said. “He had a way of speaking that struck your soul. His metaphors were brilliant.”
The panelists praised the work, life and legacy of Malcolm X initially, but quickly asserted the need to analyze the civil rights leaders in a realistic light. Runstedlter noted how, for all of Malcolm X’s successes, he still suffered from shortcomings, especially related to black feminism and female empowerment.
“It doesn’t behoove any of us to deify and calcify people,” Runstedlter said. “We really have to historicize [Malcolm X]. We have to critique him at the same time, and one only needs to read the writings, speeches, and articulations of black feminism among his contemporaries and people who have engaged with his work since then.”
Totten complemented Runstedlter’s remarks by asking audience members to understand Malcolm X’s faults while also internalizing the context of his work and his development as a leader.
“He doesn’t get a pass, but let’s have a full conversation about where ideologies come from and how the things that showed up in Malcolm are actually within us as well,” Totten said.
As the conversation continued to develop, panelists raised points about Malcolm X’s overarching development as a thinker, highlighting both his time within the Nation of Islam movement and his journeys abroad.
Runstedlter said his ideals and plans to tackle racism during his time were unique and that the institutional racism he fought against still remains today.
“He and his contemporaries were trying to imagine something totally new and to imagine what the world would be like without these forms and structures of oppression,” Runstedlter said. “I think there is something hopeful to take away from this, even if we found the resiliency of those structures in our present moment.”
Though discussions on Malcolm X’s legacy contributed to the early parts of the discussion, the panelists soon moved to examining the role of black women and feminism both in the civil rights era and in the present day.
Byrd said the stereotypical view of the role of black women in families has hardly evolved since the civil rights era. Without any progress on this front, she maintained, real progress toward racial and gender equality cannot be reached.
“We have this legacy of ‘white women want get out of the house and work’ without the conversations on how women of color always had to work. Such a political thought process continues today,” Byrd said. “It’s the black woman’s fault that the condition of the black community is the way that it is because they are not mirroring what is the acceptable dominant idea of family and structure.”
Brown soon engaged with a question about what it means to be a black feminist in the 21st century. She highlighted her experience with feminism as an idea and explained how women should not associate only empowerment with feminism’s purpose.
“I’ve gotten a lot of pushback from people telling me I’m not doing feminism right because I come from a different vantage point and I don’t foreground white women in my analysis,” Brown said. “I try to teach my students the difference between being empowered as a woman and being a feminist. You can have a lot of power as a woman, but that doesn’t automatically make you a feminist.”
Attendee Amin Gharad (COL ’17), while appreciative of the panelists’ knowledge and dialogue, said the event’s title was misleading. Gharad said he felt as though not enough time was spent on Malcolm X and his relationship with feminist dialogue and ideas.
“In no way am I claiming that Malcolm X hasn’t done or said things that could be considered problematic by, say, engaging his life as part of a feminist dialogue, in fact that could’ve made for an enlightening exercise and was why I decided to attend, but this event definitely wasn’t a meaningful exploration of his life in that regard,” Gharad said.

The Services Employee International Union, Local 500, which represents part-time faculty, has strongly defended its position at Georgetown University, though questions still remain about the sudden resignation of adjunct computer science professor Matthew Devost on Feb. 8.
Devost claims he had no choice but to resign after being told he was out of compliance with the collective bargaining agreement between the university and the SEIU Local 500. Devost did not pay union dues after he alleged that union representatives harassed him to join the process of unionization that occurred two years ago.
Adjunct faculty member and longtime member of the original union negotiating team Kerry Danner-McDonald said the process of running a union is an ever-evolving act. She condemned any coercive tactics and regretted that the situation had been allowed to escalate to the level at which Devost resigned.
“Whenever a union comes in there’s going to be some changes. I think what happened in that situation is really unfortunate,” Danner-McDonald said. “I don’t condone any type of coercive tactics.”
Danner-McDonald also said in order to avoid similar situations, the union is working on establishing better communication with its members. She added that the first priority is ensuring that clear information on what being part of the union entails for faculty members is readily available.
“We would like the contract letter that goes out to part time faculty to be a little more explicit,” Danner-McDonald said. “People would know exactly what it means before they join. Right now there’s [only] a link to click on.”
Danner-McDonald defended the ability of the SEIU Local 500 to force adjuncts and part-time faculty to pay an agency fee to the union, even if it goes against the part-time faculty member’s wishes.
The agency fee entails paying 80 percent of current full-time union dues, but this monetary amount can be donated to charity if a conflict of interest arises. According to Devost, the union rejected his appeal to get exemption status based upon ideological grounds.
Danner-McDonald said part-time faculty members still receive the benefits the union negotiates for the part-time professors, even if they are not part of the union, and therefore should acknowledge that fact.
“Whatever benefits we gain, it affects everyone,” Danner-McDonald said. “The agency fee is about addressing the issue of free ridership. There can’t be free riders who say, ‘I don’t want to pay, but I get all the benefits.’”
SEIU Local 500 Political Director Anne McLeer declined to comment on Devost’s specific situation. McLeer noted that the agency fee and Union dues are based on an independent audit of the union’s finances. McLeer also defended the agency fee as a necessary step to ensure the union can continue to function.
“The rationale behind the agency fee, which was ratified by a majority of Georgetown adjuncts, is that everybody is represented so everybody should pay a fair share of the costs,” McLeer said. “The way the agency fee is calculated is based on an independent audit.”
McLeer did criticize the professors who refused to pay the agency fee, noting they have had multiple opportunities to reject the unionization process when it first came about in 2014.
According to McLeer, even if some adjuncts did not want a union, they would still be welcome to work with the organizing team or local union leadership.
“The contract was sent out to every adjunct who was teaching at the time. It was ratified by a majority of adjuncts who voted,” McLeer said. “The adjuncts had two opportunities to say no to a union. The majority of them didn’t.”
The idea of adjuncts and part-time faculty deciding to form a union came about after the number of part-time university professors increased. During previous decades, Danner-McDonald said, 75 percent of the faculty was on a tenure track at a university. Now, that number has been reduced to a third, with another third of all professors being part time.
“There’s been a lot of expansion of management and a lot of corporate mentality,” Danner-McDonald said. “There’s a lot of growing pressure on departments to keep costs low and faculty as flexible as possible.”
Danner-McDonald said since its inception, the union has raised the minimum rate for professors to be paid for their courses to at least $200, established a professional development fund for part-time faculty members to be reimbursed to further their research and established a just-cause consideration so that faculty members cannot be let go without explanation.
McLeer encouraged any part-time or adjunct faculty members with misgivings to come to union meetings and voice concerns. She said the union exists to benefit the part-time faculty, who need a voice in the political process.
“I would encourage adjuncts to come to meetings, to get involved, to call us, to be active and really to try to make the union as vibrant and strong as it could possibly be,” McLeer said. “It’s about having a voice and a platform to address issues.”
The union represents around 400 to 450 part-time professors every year. Around 35 percent of part-time faculty members voted to ratify the collective bargaining agreement between the union and Georgetown in 2014 when it was proposed. Only around 50 percent in total voted.
“Through our continued work together, part-time faculty members in our community will feel as welcomed and valued as other faculty members,” the Office of the Provost’s original announcement of the union read. “We want to honor what each individual brings to his or her work.”

This is a perfect example of The Hoya’s liberal bias.  It’s like an SEIU press release in the guise of a news article.  The only people they quote are the SEIU official and the adjunct whose coercive organizing tactics were part of the reason we no longer have a great professor who is a huge thought leader in his field.  And there is no representation of the other side, ergo no balance.  
Poor “journalism”.
[…] bring unexpected problems for academics, upon arrival — sometimes even before they're voted in. At Georgetown University, the SEIU faced claims of coercion during the campaign process and harassme…. Once a union gets in, there's no guarantee that they'll be able to make good on the promises […]

Despite Georgetown University’s relatively low endowment, the Georgetown Board of Directors announced its approval of the university’s largest-ever increase in financial aid for students in the coming academic year Feb. 16.
Georgetown will invest over $177 million next year in financial aid, a record increase of eight percent from this year’s investment of $166.6 million. The increase corresponds with a rise in the cost of tuition for the university, which will grow four percent from $48,048 to $49,968 for the 2016 to 2017 academic year.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon highlighted the increase — the largest-ever annual increase in financial aid — as an indication of Georgetown’s commitment to supporting its students.
“As a need-blind, meet-full-need institution, the projected financial aid costs will rise on a annual basis so long as costs increase,” Deacon said. “There will be an annual increase in financial aid to meet these costs for those receiving financial aid.”
Dean of Student Financial Services Patricia McWade stressed that financial aid increases have become a regular feature of Georgetown’s budgetary process in recent years.
“The increase came as no surprise to me,” McWade said. “I’ve been here 25 years and the board has always approved the adequate amount of resources to meet the needs of our undergraduates.”
McWade explained that the additional eight percent, besides being allocated toward undergraduate financial aid, will also benefit other members of the university community.
“The eight percent number includes money for graduate students and professional students as well. It is a university-wide number,” McWade said. “We will have adequate funding to cover the needs of our undergrad students.”
Georgetown Scholarship Program Director Missy Foy noted that as the cost of attending university has increased, the number of students who can afford to cover tuition without assistance has evidently decreased. As a result, in order to provide equal opportunities to all who apply, Georgetown’s significant supplement to financial aid is a necessity.
“Only about three percent of Americans can afford a Georgetown education without a scholarship,” Foy said. “Unless we limit ourselves, you dilute the quality of the student body and the diversity of opinions.”
Foy stressed the importance of increasing the university’s financial aid in order to remain competitive with peer institutions. In order to attract the best students, Georgetown must be willing to spend large amounts on financial aid packages.
“The university has been meeting the full financial need of admitted students for over 30 years and that’s been central to getting us to the place where we want to be as a competitive institution,” Foy said. “On a competitive basis, it’s really important.”
According to McWade, if Georgetown seeks to continue living up to its Jesuit values, it will need to increase financial aid in accordance with changing education costs. She noted that providing comprehensive and need-blind aid remains an integral part of the Georgetown admissions process.
“It’s a wonderful thing that the board of directors and president have agreed to commit,” McWade said. “It means that it’s a high priority for this Jesuit, Catholic university because it allows us to have the socioeconomic diversity that everyone benefits from.”
Foy praised the willingness of the board to continuously allot a large amount of funding from its budget for financial aid. Other institutions are able to completely fund their financial aid through endowment money but because of Georgetown’s relatively low endowment, it must find other sources for financial aid. As of June 2014, Georgetown’s endowment was $1.4 billion, compared to Harvard University’s $35.9 billion.
Foy praised Georgetown’s commitment to maintaining its financial support of students despite its small endowment.
“We’re competing against schools like Harvard, who has an endowment that’s much greater than the size of ours,” Foy said. “With a very modest endowment, I think it’s impressive that Georgetown has prioritized this.”
Foy encouraged students to donate to the university after they graduate, emphasizing that doing so will enable future generations of students to continue to attend Georgetown.
“We don’t have the endowment to fund aid, so I hope that students reading this article understand that this is all the more reason to donate after you graduate,” Foy said. “If you like half the people sitting around you in any given class, you should donate to the Georgetown fund.”

Georgetown’s Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics and the Theater Communications Group launched the Global Theater Initiative Feb. 12, a program to increase internationalism in the U.S. theater community.
The Initiative will be headed by Teresa Eyring, executive director of TCG, and Professor Derek Goldman, co-founding director of the lab.
Georgetown’s Davis Performing Arts Center will host the inaugural gathering of the Global Theater Initiative in June, a conference that will bring together performing artists from around the world to discuss challenges they face in spreading their art.
The initiative will work to connect the performing arts community with resources, advocate collaboration and strategize ways to help internationalize the U.S. theater community. The initiative will also help lead the U.S. Center of the International Theater Institute with the TCG in assisting international theater professionals looking for work in the United States.
Informed by past collaborations with groups such as Belarus Free Theatre, who operate in secret in their home country, and the Syria Trojan Women, who were prevented from coming to the United States by the Bureau of Consular Affairs, conference attendees will discuss how the spread of performing arts is largely determined by diplomacy.
“Very often theater becomes a pawn in international disputes,” Georgetown adjunct professor Cynthia Schneider, former U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands, said. “We may have a discussion about the challenges of theater being a prisoner to political tensions while at the same time trying to humanize those tensions and show them in a way that people can relate to and understand.”
In the past, Schneider and Goldman have co-taught a course at Georgetown entitled “Diplomacy and Culture: Performance, Film, Media,” which examined the intersection between theater and diplomacy. The course covered a variety of topics, including drama, ethnographic poetry and the exploration of the ways in which arts and culture inform how people and nations interact. Many of the ideas taught in the course will be essential for the initiative.
Goldman said that the arts can play an important role in raising awareness, something the lab has focused on.
“The success of the lab has been that it’s tapping into an awareness,” Goldman said. “Culture, and performance in particular, has a really important role to play in humanizing, creating empathy and making it impossible to deny the humanity of other human beings.”
Devika Ranjan (SFS ’17) who took the course, said art can represent the state of international politics and can inform citizens about its implications.
“International politics is a field in which you have to represent yourself and where you come from.” Ranjan said. “Art is a very good tool for politics. [It] can transcend language and cultural barriers in order to understand other people: understand other cultures.”
Alex Prout (COL ’19), a theater and performance studies major, stressed the importance of diversity in theater.
“Diversity is so important. Exclusion is not what the theater’s about at all. American theater is fantastic, but acting as a profession can take on a whole other level in other countries,” Prout said.
In conjunction with TCG’s annual conference in Washington, the initiative will arrange a pre-conference entitled “Finding Home: Migration, Exile, and Belonging,” which will explore the issue of international migration through a series of performances, dialogues and conversations with theater companies from around the world.
“Xenophobia is something that exists all the time for migrants,” Camille Bangug (SFS ’19) said. “Knowing that the cultures [of migrants] are beautiful and that they can produce beautiful art in ways that we can all appreciate can create a powerful conversation.”

ABC “Nightline” former anchor of 25 years Ted Koppel argued that the United States electrical grid is vulnerable to external attacks and the United States should take countermeasures to prevent this threat while discussing his new book “Lights Out” with University President John DeGioia in Riggs Library on Tuesday.
Koppel, who currently serves as a senior news analyst for National Public Radio, began the discussion by describing conversations with multiple military and intelligence officials who corroborated his convictions that a cyberattack on electrical grids could take place.
Additionally, Koppel expressed his alarm at the lack of coverage this issue has received on the national stage.
“It’s not a question of if this happens, it’s just a question of when. And that was the message I kept getting repeated and I think it’s significant that here we are and this still isn’t being talked about. None of the presidential candidates — except Jim Webb — have had anything to say about this,” Koppel said.
Koppel contended that a hack of the nation’s electrical system would entail a national or regional blackout that may cause the deaths of millions.
The United States has focused more resources on less effective security measures, according to Koppel. Koppel cited the $7 billion spent on the Transportation Security Administration every year following the 9/11 attacks, despite the agency’s 5-percent success rate, as an example of the reactionary nature of the United State’s defense mechanisms.
“When we talk about being a reactive society, that’s sort of understating the case. We are an over-reactive society,” Koppel said.
Koppel also expressed concern with the fragmented national efforts to remedy any sort of crisis state by state.
“We like to think that we’re one country under God, but the fact of the matter is that we are one country made up of 50 separate states, each of which has its own regulations,” Koppel said.
Koppel said the hacking of the United States electrical grid could be similar to the Cold War era threat of nuclear war, and claimed the effects would be similarly destructive. He added that our current dilemma cannot be dealt with in a manner comparable to our Cold War solution of mutually assured destruction, since it is not a viable countermeasure to cyberterrorism.
Koppel said smaller-scale radical entities that seek the absolute destruction of the United States will eventually possess the capabilities to orchestrate a hack that will leave the United States powerless.
“The problem is, at the moment, those who have the greatest capability have the least motivation, and those who have the greatest motivation often have the least capability,” Koppel said. “But, entities like [the Islamic State group] and North Korea do not have the capability, but their motivation tells us that it is only a matter of time before they get the capability.”
Koppel said the electrical power industry’s noncompliance with efforts to scrutinize and better protect its computer systems would compromise companies’ ability to make a profit.
“They [the electric power industry] fear re-regulation more than they fear the danger of a cyberattack,” said Koppel.
Koppel maintained a stance of safety over privacy and recognized the hardships and moral ambiguity involved in Internet defense mechanisms given the nature of the technology.
“The Internet was never designed to be defended. It was first designed so that professors could share information across great distances in a matter of seconds,” Koppel said. “Nobody ever imagined, when the Internet was first created, that the time would come when we would be as dependent upon it as we are and that people would try to take it down.”
Maddie Vagadori (COL ’19) and Roey Hadar (SFS ’17), who attended the event, expressed their concern at the issue of cyberterrorism and the lack of attention it is given in the United States.
“Even in the bombardment of media we are faced with every day, this never comes up. To me, this brings to mind the question of why we haven’t heard about this,” Vagadori said.
“He did an excellent job of highlighting an issue that is completely overlooked, yet is one that is still so important to us,” Hadar said. “Like he said, an attack like this could happen any day and we’re not prepared for it. It’s really something I think our leaders should prioritize a little more.”

Georgetown University Medical Center researchers introduced a possible anti-cancer therapy in the form of two drugs sourced from the plant hormone strigolactone in a study published Feb. 16.
The two drugs have been found to cause DNA breakage and turn off a major DNA repair mechanism in cancer cells, thereby inhibiting the ability of more aggressive cancers to repair themselves once damaged.
The synthetic plant compounds, also known as MEB55 and ST362, have only recently been introduced into the realm of human health. Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center researcher and professor Ronit Yarden, along with a team of researchers, was the first to publish the role of strigolactones in mammalian rather than plant cells.
The team included researchers from Georgetown, the Agricultural Research Organization in Israel, the University of Turin in Italy, the National Cancer Institute and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
In a previous study, Yarden and her team reported that strigolactones induce apoptosis, or programmed cell death, and cell cycle arrest. In this most recent study, Yarden and her team investigated the processes by which these agents cause cell death.
Cancer cells rely heavily on DNA repair mechanisms, which are necessary for cell survival. The two hormones studied were found to trigger a DNA damage-like response.
According to Preclinical Imaging Research Laboratory Director and founder Christopher Albanese, specific pressures are too much for cancer cells to handle, which leads to damaged DNA. Once DNA becomes damaged beyond repair, the cell will die.
“Cancer cells are very smart, smarter than us. Certain stresses, though, are too much for them to handle, like damaged DNA,” Albanese said. “The hormones in the study induced a DNA damage-like response, which leads to inevitable cell death mode. The hope is that cancer will be become much more manageable.”
The researchers found that strigolactones halt the DNA repair process after the cell’s DNA is copied and before it divides. However, even if one repair mechanism is shut down, the cancer cells have the capacity to rely on a second repair mechanism and still survive.
The team is currently experimenting with the compound in mice studies. If the mice studies are successful, the drug will move to a phased clinical trial. The researchers hope to eventually begin testing on humans, and ultimately receive a drug company investment in their compound.
Yarden said she conceived the idea of using plant compounds to combat cancer cells in an unconventional way.
“It was very random. I have a friend, who is now my collaborator, and she is a molecular biologist but of plants. We discussed our research at a social event and she told me she was working with those compounds and that they have some properties that inhibit cell cycle and stem cells in plants,” Yarden said. “It was a long shot, a very long shot. We thought that if they inhibit stem cells in plants, maybe these universal systems would also be applicable for cancer cells.”
Though the study initially focused on breast cancer, Yarden said she soon realized the compounds could battle other types of cancers as well.
“We started with breast cancer because that was my main research before this project, but now we have tested many different cancer cell lines and we know that it’s effective toward prostate, lung and color cancer cell lines,” Yarden said. “In both prostate and breast cancer we noticed that it’s very effective toward the more aggressive types of cancer cells.”
Albanese said the hope is if these drugs are applied to humans, the same therapeutic activity will occur.
Albanese highlighted the important role of drug companies in drug research, saying that corporations are primarily interested in investing in certain drugs that will have large payoffs.
“Drug companies need to see that the drugs in vivo work with the same mechanisms as in cell culture,” Albanese said. “In order to get a drug to market, you need money and interest. Drug companies are looking for blockbuster drugs to pay for expenses.”
Albanese added that the drugs are a long way from going on the market, in part because of the high costs of putting a drug through the process of obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.
“The failure rates are huge, the costs are even more huge,” Albanese said. “It takes up to one billion dollars to get from the stage we are at now to FDA approval.”
The research primarily focused on breast cancer, but the team also tested many different cell lines, including prostate and colon cancer cells. In prostate and breast cancer, the drugs were more effective against the more aggressive types of cancer cells.
Yarden stressed that because the drug is in such an early stage, the researchers cannot guarantee the drug’s ability to fully treat cancer.
“It’s a long way. We just started the studies in May,” Yarden said. “It’s just such an early phase.”
Jefferson Haake (NHS ’16), one of the primary researchers published in the study, said that despite the strigolatones’ aggression toward cancer cells, they do not harm normal cells, which is a problem often associated with chemotherapy treatments. Haake added that the lack of damage inflicted on normal cells could alleviate the side effects that typically accompany anti-cancer therapeutic treatments. This would allow a higher dosage of drugs in chemotherapeutic regimens and enable a more aggressive attack on the cancer cells.
“The two main takeaways from this study for the educated layperson are that, the compound is something that is toxic toward cancer but not to, as far as we know, non-cancer cells,” Haake said. “You are actually killing the cancer as opposed to getting your own cells caught in the crossfire. That’s a big issue with chemotherapy today, is that you are essentially pumping someone full of toxins and hoping that it takes the cancer faster than it takes the person.”

Georgetown University will expand its research on mobile money in East Africa and its effect on the Kenyan and Ugandan populations after receiving a $3.5 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced Feb. 12.
The Georgetown University Initiative on Innovation, Development and Evaluation, also known as gui2de, created the project as part of its research to evaluate the effects of policies implemented in developing countries. This specific project will involve two years of field research and data analysis on mobile money platforms and their effects on low-income populations in East Africa.
The project, which is a joint operation conducted by the McCourt School of Public Policy and the economics department, has yet to begin, but will be based in gui2de’s new office in Nairobi, Kenya.
Co-director of gui2de and Georgetown economics professor Billy Jack defined mobile money as a means of transferring money through the technology found on mobile phones and computers.
“All you have to do is write a text message and you can transfer money across a country,” Jack said.
Jack said that the grant will be used to study this technology in an attempt to further develop platforms that utilize it.
“This grant is to facilitate the speculative innovation on the mobile platform,” Jack said. “We’re going to work with a mobile platform, a bank and an IT platform in Kenya and Uganda to look at ways that we can actually create new services on the mobile platform.”
McCourt School of Public Policy Dean Edward Montgomery stressed the importance of conducting this research not only in East Africa, but internationally.
“It’s part of our mission to think about the best way to improve people’s lives around the world,” Montgomery said. “This technology is changing conditions on the ground and allowing people to have access to important financial markets. We want to do some research to see if it’s working well.”
Jack highlighted the various uses of mobile money and the implications this has for safety and convenience in financial transactions.
“Even at an individual level, finance is really important. It can mean just the ability to pay someone — and to do that, you have to have cash on you. In some places, that can be dangerous,” Jack said. “Someone else could steal it. Having money on your mobile phone is less dangerous and you can send or use money not just with someone right in front of you, but with someone on the other side of the country. It can also be expanded to include other financial services such as credit, insurance and savings.”
Jack emphasized that the aim of the project is to assist lower-income populations in East Africa.
“A lot of people think of Wall Street and rich people when they think of financial services. Poor people need these services too,” Jack said. “Virtually every single adult in Kenya now has a mobile phone. Ninety percent of them have access to the mobile money platform. We’d like to build innovative progress on the platform that is already established.”
The gui2de program also encourages students to become involved in its research. It hosts a summer internship open to rising seniors and Masters students that allows them to spend at least two months in developing countries. The initiative expects to have eight summer interns this year.
Montgomery emphasized the program’s aim to allow students to conduct hands-on research.
“This is an exciting way for both McCourt students and undergraduates at Georgetown to get involved with field research or to work with faculty members here to apply what they’ve learned in their economics classes or computer science classes or business classes to see how this technology is changing people’s lives,” Montgomery said. “Research is a great complement to what you’ve learned in the classroom and apply it to the real world. For our students who are thinking about going on to grad school or continuing with these studies, this program offers a unique opportunity to gather experience.”
Max Magerman (SFS ’16), who previously worked in Tanzania with gui2de, said he valued the opportunity to gain insight into international developments.
“It’s a really incredible opportunity that allows you to travel to and work in a part of the world that you may not be able to otherwise. The work you do is important and the feedback is definitely appreciated back home,” Magerman said. “It was really interesting to see how an idea can be conceptualized and implemented into a country. It’s the best way I can think of to get real experience in the field.”
