Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Jessica Andino (COL ’18) won the Georgetown University Student Association election early this morning, narrowly defeating Garet Williams (COL ’18) and Habon Ali (COL ’18) by 34 votes, the closest margin in recent electoral history.
Mack and Andino received 50.74 percent — 1,160 votes — in the final round, with Williams and Ali receiving 49.26 percent — 1,126 votes.
The Mack-Andino ticket, which ran with the vision of “A Fresh GUSA,” focused on making a Georgetown education more affordable, improving mental health resources and spurring entrepreneurship on campus.
Both Mack and Andino joined GUSA two semesters ago in the spring of 2016. Mack was the only sophomore candidate in a race of three other junior presidential candidates.
Mack currently serves as secretary of Local Education Affairs within the Federal Relations Committee while Andino is the chair of the Undocumented Student Policy Team.
Upon hearing the result, Mack and his campaign headed to the White House after a short celebration in Ryan Hall and Freedom Hall.
At Monday evening’s GUSA presidential debate, John Matthews (COL ’18) and Nick Matz (COL ’18) announced their ticket and Mack-Andino had cross-endorsed one another. Matthews and Matz were eliminated in the third round of voting last night, after earning 686 votes.
The election was competitive through all four rounds of voting, with Williams and Ali leading through the first three rounds of voting. The Williams-Ali ticket led with 958 votes, followed by Mack and Andino with 829 votes at the end of the third round.
Jenny Franke (COL ’18) and Jack McGuire (COL ’18), who did not participate in either of the GUSA debates and did not have an official platform, were the first official ticket to be eliminated with 94 votes. Williams and Ali led with 929 votes, followed by Mack and Andino with 808 votes and Matthews and Matz with 658 votes.
Thirty-eight percent of the student body voted in the election, with a voter turnout of 2,557 votes cast, surpassing the 2,388 votes in 2016. The all-time election record is 3,733 voters from the 2013 election.
Mack said he is ready to start working as GUSA president after a challenging campaign.
“I’m feeling really good. We’ve gone through a lot as a team. We’ve faced a lot of challenges but we came out on top and it feels good,” Mack said. “There’s a lot we have to do. The work starts now.”
Current GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said Mack and Andino’s policy has the potential to create real change at Georgetown.
“The three major campaigns ran bearing in mind a lot of policy, and changes they wanted, and regardless whatever happens next is going to be exciting,” Khan said. “Kamar and Jessica have some really cool ideas on student health in particular, and I hope to come back as an alum and see some of the things they’re proposing be implemented.”
Ali said despite her ticket’s loss, the inclusive message of their ticket will have a lasting impact.
“I tell to every single person who voted for us, ‘Don’t forget what you wanted, you believed in that message, going to every community that you come from and really making that difference,’” Ali said. “It’s about grassroots work and it’s really putting that effort in from the start.”
The polls opened at 11 p.m. Wednesday, following two weeks of campaigning starting Feb. 9. The campaign season was marked by GUSA outsider candidates in Matthews and Matz and a focus on affordability issues at Georgetown.
The Hoya conducted a door-to-door poll of 535 students Tuesday evening, with Williams and Ali holding a 13.8 percent lead over Mack and Andino. 42.2 percent of likely voters said they planned to vote for Williams and Ali, followed by 28.4 percent saying they planned to vote for Mack and Andino.
Matthews said he is happy for Mack and Andino, especially in light of the tickets’ cross-endorsement.
“Our cross-endorsement worked,” Matthews said. “Great to see they came out on top.”
The GUSA election commission hand-counted all votes after the license for the software they used expired. However, according to GUSA Election Commissioner Grady Willard (COL ’18), the election proceeded normally.
“Write-ins always affect the procedure, it’s so much easier to count without them. It always takes more time, but there wasn’t anything unusual about write-ins,” Willard said.
According to current GUSA Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17), he and Khan are committed to a smooth transition between executive leadership.
“Regardless of who would have won tonight, Enushe and I are going to spend the next month doing our very best to prepare them to take on the role for the next year,” Fisk said.
Looking forward to the next year, Mack said he hopes his and Andino’s vision for GUSA can bring the university together.
“We want to make everyone feel like they’re welcome,” Mack said. “We want to bring resources for all. We want to deliver on what we’ve been talking about and rally the people around our vision.”

Congratulations Mack!  
As for Williams/Ali, you have only yourselves and Enushe + Chris to blame.  You probably lost 34 votes with that stunt she pulled at the the debate (not to mention Chris’s extended commentary at the VP debate).  What probably worked against you too were those stupid Heckler questions at the VP debate.  If GUSA can’t take itself seriously then other people won’t either.
You were also the insider candidates and instead of caring about affordability which you never addressed until the very last minute after the other two tickets had made it a priority from the beginning you actually said the administration deserved to be “applauded” in regards to tuition despite the fact it keeps going up and up and up.  
Crenushe’s botching of the referendum and not doing anything substantial during their term and also defending the administration for tuition increases and calling the campus plan which imposed a three-year housing requirement as a “success” caused a lot of anger toward GUSA which affected you.  
But you also didn’t have anything innovative in your platform and your identity politics hurt you because it was obvious you wouldn’t unite the campus.  You kept complaining about “straight white men” and Habon couldn’t muster any valid reason to vote for your ticket during the VP debate except that she’s a refugee and Muslim.  Mack played the diversity card too but he wasn’t alienating the way you two were and he actually said some nice things about white people and has been more of a uniter than a divider in regards to identity politics.
Perhaps GUSA will get better now that we have some new blood in-charge who actually appear to care more about fighting for student interests than being the administration’s representative to students.  
Mack, remember, your job isn’t to be friends with the administration.  If you’re like the current GUSA and care more about getting invited to events and letters of recommendation from the administration you will be a poor president.  Instead, fight for student interests, call them out when appropriate, and do everything you can to lower costs and return power back to the studentry.  You’re a tech guy, so set up a way where students can allocate 50% or more of their student activities fee to the clubs of their choice.  It’s easy, but bureaucrats in GUSA would rather have that power to themselves.  
And implement some of the Matthews/Matz proposals.  The fact is you YOU WOULD NOT HAVE WON had this been a race b/w you and Williams alone.  They rallied their supporters to you with the cross-endorsement and made affordability the main issue.  If anything, this race tipped when Matthew’s called out Enushe and destroyed her during the debate after the stunt she pulled to help Garet.  It’s fair to say you owe them and their supporters the election because they made up the difference.  So remember their issues and concerns.
Good luck with the new administration.  You can’t be any worse than the last one.

Did you guys use Ranked-Choice-Voting in your poll? If not, that explains a lot.

The United States should strive to be a welcoming place for both diversity and the freedom to express one’s views, argued U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at a promotional event Thursday evening for her book, which was co-written by two Georgetown University Law Center professors.
At the event, Ginsburg shared the stories behind her court decisions and her career experiences alongside contributing authors and biographers of her book “My Own Words,” professors Mary Hartnett and Wendy Williams.
Jeffrey Minear, counsel to Chief Justice John Roberts and executive director of the Fellows Program introduced Ginsburg, Hartnett and Williams along with moderator Nina Totenberg, a National Public Radio reporter who covers the Supreme Court.
Totenberg began the discussion by asking about the justice’s health and famed workout routine, which she does at the Supreme Court gymnasium for one hour twice a week.
“Do you still do the medicine ball?” Totenberg asked.
“Oh, I do various-sized balls,” Ginsburg replied after inquiring about the definition of a medicine ball.
Totenberg asked the biographers for their favorite stories about the justice and excerpts from the book.
Williams cited Ginsburg’s writing on the 1967 Loving v. Virginia decision, which ruled the prohibition of interracial marriage unconstitutional.
“It’s one of the shortest ones in there and it’s a little piece on the Loving marriage and Loving case, which she said is one of the most important cases decided by the Supreme Court,” Williams said. “Ruth wrote this quite a bit before there was ever a movie coming out about it.”
Ginsburg argued that the Loving case, along with the Kirchberg v. Feenstra decision overturning Head and Master law — which permitted a husband to have final say about all household decisions — were integral in setting the precedent for the later decision to effectively legalize same-sex marriage in the 2013 United States v. Windsor case, which deemed the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional.
“Marriage had to become a relationship between equals before there could be any thought of same-sex marriage,” Ginsburg said.
Hartnett followed that up with a lighthearted story about Ginsburg going parasailing in Nice, France, in 2002 with former Hofstra Law Dean David Yellen.
Ginsburg said her favorite excerpts from the book were those written by her late husband and fellow lawyer, Marty Ginsburg, who was a professor at GULC until his death in 2010.
Totenberg asked Ginsburg to share a piece of marital advice.
“When my late husband died and I remarried, she performed the ceremony, so I wonder if I could get her to tell the story of her wedding and the advice that her mother-in-law gave her,” Totenberg said.
“She told me, ‘Sometimes, it helps to be a little deaf,’” Ginsburg recalled. “And I have followed that advice assiduously, not only in my marriage but in every place I work.”
Totenberg quickly segued into a discussion of more current concerns, specifically focusing on Ginsburg’s opinions of the process of filling a seat on the bench formerly occupied by the late Justice Antonin Scalia (CAS ’57).
Ginsburg pointed out that the U.S. Senate confirmed Scalia unanimously and that she was confirmed by a 96-vote majority. When Totenberg later pressed her for an opinion on President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, she recalled befriending him on a justice exchange program in the United Kingdom.
“I think he’s very easy to get along with. … He writes very well,” Ginsburg said.
The remainder of the discussion centered on Ginsburg’s legacy of feminism within the judicial system. Among other topics, she spoke about the importance of defending principles and the mentorship she received from the first female justice on the Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor.
When asked about the stupidest question she had ever received, Ginsburg spoke about former Chief Justice William Rehnquist and how he asked about her willingness to settle for Susan B. Anthony’s face on the new dollar coin.
“That was still okay to say in 1978. Then, flash-forward many years; it was the same man who wrote an opinion that so well understands what working women encounter that when I brought the decision home to show it to Marty, he asked me if I wrote it,” Ginsburg said. “So that’s one of my best examples that as long as we live, we can learn.”
The event was sponsored by the Newseum and the Supreme Court Fellows Program in their eighth consecutive year of partnership.
Ginsburg said the United States should be a society open to dialogue and cooperation, and that the United States is “not experiencing the best of times.”
“Our history has been so long I think that we will preserve both of those: the right to think, speak and write as we believe and not as big brother government tells us is the right way to think and welcome our neighbors,” Ginsburg said.
Following that, she ended on a note of optimism and progress when Totenberg asked about the differences made by having three women on the court.
“Because of my seniority, I sit toward the middle of the bench. Justice Sonia Sotomayor is on my left and Justice Kagan is on my right. We look like we are there to stay,” Ginsburg said. “Now when people visit the Supreme Court, they can say, ‘Women are justices, and that’s something I can aspire to. I can aspire to be a lawyer or a judge.’”
[…] Sotomayor is on my left and Justice Kagan is on my right. We look like we are there to stay,” Ginsburg told the Hoya this […]

Last December’s Georgetown University Student Association club funding referendum, which was later invalidated, would have been approved by more than a two-third margin, according to the results released by the Election Commission early Friday morning.
The results were voided by the GUSA Constitutional Council Jan. 20 on the grounds that the GUSA senate violated GUSA bylaws by failing to present the details of the referendum to the student body within 14 days of the vote.
The referendum, which would have replaced the senate with a proposed assembly, passed with 69 percent in support of club funding reform and 31 percent against, with a 37 percent turnout. The referendum received support from 25.5 percent of the total undergraduate student body, just over the 25 percent necessary to pass. However, the results remain null and void, and were released only for informational purposes.
The petitioners in the original case argued that supporters of the referendum within GUSA mounted an electioneering campaign to influence votes and failed to inform students according to the constitutionally mandated timeline.
“While to some people it might seem like a technicality, to me and some other people I’ve talked to, it’s just emblematic of this greater problem of unintentionally misinforming students and not giving them the opportunity to be most informed that they could be before voting,” Jasmin Ouseph ’19, who filed the appeal, said.
The constitutional council rejected the petitioners’ electioneering complaints but ruled in their favor that the referendum was not presented to students in a timely way as required by GUSA bylaws. The council declared the results null and void, and prohibited the election commission from revealing the results to any other members of GUSA or the public.
However, GUSA senators Scott Lowder (COL’17) and Owen Hayes (SFS ’18), chair and vice chair of the Finance and Appropriations Committee of GUSA, filed an appeal to overturn the original opinion. In its second opinion released Feb. 18, the council upheld the decision to invalidate the results, but also overturned their earlier order prohibiting the release of the results.
“This council withheld the release of the December 1st Constitutional Referendum Vote based on a balancing of competing interests: those of the public’s right of transparency, against the potential that the results could bias a second referendum vote,” the second opinion reads. “The potential for bias, which is small and practically eliminated given the Council’s final order, is outweighed by the demonstrative call for transparency.”
In a tweet shortly after the second council opinion was released, the election commission announced it would release the results of the nullified referendum Friday morning, along with the results of Thursday’s executive election.
Lowder maintained that the results should not have been invalidated, but said he approved of the decision allowing the results to be released.
“If the results are released on Thursday, and it shows that it would’ve been approved had it not been invalidated, that puts a mandate on either this session of the senate or the next GUSA executive to present this again to the student body because it shows a desire for club funding reform and restructuring going forward,” Lowder said.
Ouseph, who opposed the referendum, expressed concern that the release of results would do exactly that.
“I’m worried that GUSA might use that to push a second referendum onto the student body or get this restructuring club funding reform package passages again,” Ouseph said.
GUSA senate speaker Richie Mullaney (COL ‘18) said the lengthy course of the referendum points to larger problems in GUSA’s structure.
“The fact that this saga took 85 days to complete proves there are structural problems in GUSA that need to be addressed. Long processes that aren’t transparent like these are exactly what alienates students from GUSA,” Mullaney wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m glad that we finally get to see the results because students deserve that transparency.
The electioneering case was filed by GUSA senators Jasmin Ouseph (SFS ’19), Isaac Liu (COL ’20) and Charles Hajjar (MSB ’20), GUSA Free Speech Policy Team chair D.J. Angelini (MSB ’17), GUSA Dining and Auxiliary Services Policy Team chair Mark Camilli (COL ’19) and Dylan Hughes (COL ’19), who is unaffiliated with GUSA.

Georgetown University was included in a list of the 10 worst colleges for free speech compiled by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education based on free speech cases the foundation has worked on during the previous year.
In a report released Wednesday, FIRE — a nonprofit focused on defending individual liberties at educational institutions — citied an incident last year at Georgetown University Law Center in which students were blocked from campaigning for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on campus.
During the September 2015 primary season, GULC’s Office of Student Life rejected students’ request to table for Sanders outside GULC’s McDonough Hall. The group instead used tables inside the McDonough cafeteria to campaign, but Oct. 13, 2015 — the day of the first Democratic debate — the group was asked to leave by university officials.
The university cited that because of its tax-exempt status as a nonprofit organization under the 501(c)(3) category of the Internal Revenue Code, it could not engage in partisan political campaign activity.
FIRE Director of Litigation Marieke Tuthill Beck-Coon cited the status of the student group H*yas for Choice, which is not formally recognized by the university, as an additional reason behind Georgetown’s position on the list.
“Georgetown has made some efforts to improve its policies on speech and expression in recent years, but its execution has not always been great, as I’m sure H*yas for Choice can attest, considering they are still not a recognized student organization,” Beck-Coon wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Law Center’s confusing and overly restrictive handling of student partisan political speech this election year is another example of that.”
FIRE wrote an open letter to Georgetown University Law Center Dean William Treanor on Feb. 1, 2016, on behalf of Alexander Atkins (LAW ’17) and other students who were tabling in  support of Sanders.
Additionally, the group spoke on behalf of Atkins at a subcommittee hearing of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight, entitled “Protecting the Free Exchange of Ideas on College Campuses,” on March 2, 2016.
Georgetown’s Office of Federal Relations wrote in a letter to the subcommittee hearing on “Protecting the Free Exchange of Ideas on College Campuses” that it was changing its policies to better protect Georgetown Law students’ right to political expression.
The Office of Federation Relations wrote in a letter to the Chairman Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) and Ranking Member of the subcommittee John Lewis (D-Ga.) on Feb. 29, 2016, to further explain changes in its policies.
“We are adjusting the policies to make very clear that individuals as well as groups are able to reserve tables for organized activity and that all members of our community are able to make reasonable use of University resources to express their political opinions,” the letter reads.
Treanor stressed the importance of free speech at GULC in an email to The Hoya.
“We share Georgetown’s commitment to the fundamental right of members of our community to free expression, dialogue and academic inquiry and are aware of the concerns expressed by our students,” Treanor wrote. “We are currently exploring the best ways to respond to these issues.”
Despite these changes in university policy, some groups still say they encounter restrictions.
2017 marks the second year Georgetown has appeared on FIRE’s list. Georgetown was first listed in 2014 because of a free speech incident regarding H*yas for Choice in which the group was removed from tabling in Healy Circle and was relocated outside of Georgetown’s front gates.
Additionally, two condom envelopes were removed Sept. 23, 2016, from the doors of students who volunteered with H*yas for Choice on the fifth floor of Village C West.
According to a September email interview with Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber, the envelopes were removed because GUPD had received a report of vandalism on the fifth floor of VCW and interpreted the envelopes as part of the vandalism.
Georgetown University Student Association and H*yas for Choice cited the incident as a violation of the free expression policy at Georgetown.
H*yas for Choice Co-President Brinna Ludwig (NHS ’17) said she believes there has been little policy change in recent years, and free speech restrictions are still a major problem for the organization.
“H*yas for Choice has encountered a number of issues related to free speech,” Ludwig wrote. “We are also restricted by the tabling zone policy, which limits where we are allowed to set up our table.”
Georgetown College Republicans President Allie Williams (SFS ’19) also highlighted the importance of expanding free speech areas on campus. Williams wrote in an email to The Hoya that because the student body tends to be more liberal, free speech issues occur particularly in regard to GUCR and the speakers the group invites to campus.
“As a college campus with a student body that inevitably leans left, Georgetown has had its fair share of free speech issues and, as a conservative organization that often invites controversial speakers, we have absolutely suffered from closed dialogue at GUCR,” Williams wrote. “The limited areas for free speech on campus is concerning and something that the University should definitely work on going forward.”
GUSA free speech policy team chair D.J. Angelini (MSB ’17) wrote in an email to The Hoya that students should see the ranking as motivation to continue to fight for free speech improvements across campus.
“I look at that rating not as an indication of what Georgetown’s doing wrong, but rather to show that we need to constantly regard speech and expression as one of the most important pieces of campus life today,” Angelini wrote. “I believe Georgetown’s administrators and students are committed to these ideals and I hope the rating energizes more students to get involved in promoting a culture of free speech on campus.”

The leaking of classified information is in the national interest, according to Daniel Ellsberg, the former Pentagon employee responsible for leaking the Pentagon Papers, at a symposium discussing the leaks and their legacy Feb. 16 and 17.
“More people ought to be revealing this secret information,” Ellsberg said. “The public needs to know. Congress needs to know. Lives depend on it. The Constitution is being violated.”
The symposium, “Free Speech Legacies: The Pentagon Papers Revisited,” featured a series of panel discussions on the leak and its legacy.  Martin Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post, and Bob Woodward, the Washington Post journalist who broke the Watergate Scandal with journalist Carl Bernstein, spoke at the symposium.
Sanford Ungar, a professor at the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, organized the symposium; it was sponsored by the President’s Office, the Journalism Program and the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs. Ungar wrote about the legal and political battles pertaining to the Pentagon Papers in his book, “The Papers and the Papers.”
While working as a strategic analyst at the RAND Corporation in 1967, Ellsberg worked on a top-secret study commissioned by then-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara regarding U.S. policy and decision-making in Vietnam from 1945 to 1968. The report revealed extensive dishonesty from four different administrations, including President Richard Nixon’s secret expansion of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.
In 1971, Ellsberg leaked the classified 7,000-page report to The New York Times. Ellsberg was tried on 12 felony counts under the Espionage Act and theft of government property for revealing the documents, charges carrying a possible sentence of 115 years. The case was later dismissed as a mistrial on the grounds of illegal and unethical conduct by the prosecution.
Thomas Banchoff, who is Georgetown’s vice president for global engagement, and introduced the keynote speaker, said the issue of government leaks today is just as important as it was in 1971 when Ellsberg first leaked the Pentagon Papers.
President Donald Trump has accused the intelligence community of making a series of leaks to the media, including information leading to the resignation of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn Feb. 13.
“Now, given where we are today, with the great tension between the White House and the mainstream media, this is indeed the ideal moment to look back at the multiple legacies of a case from 1971, which had the country and the whole world on edge,” Banchoff said.
Ellsberg said the leaks conducted by Chelsea Manning, who leaked almost 1 million classified documents to WikiLeaks in 2010, and Edward Snowden, who leaked a series of documents from the National Security Agency to The Guardian and The Washington Post in 2013, are in the national interest. President Barack Obama commuted Manning’s 35-year sentence Jan. 13.
“Manning and Snowden and I all were in the same situation. No one else was going to do it, someone had to do it, so I did it. That is what I would like people to hear,” Ellsberg added. “There is no guarantee at all that it would have any effect. However, as Snowden said, there are things worth dying for.”
Ellsberg said he was motivated to leak the documents after he learned the Nixon administration had no intention of pulling U.S. military out of Vietnam as it had claimed. Ellsberg said he hoped releasing the report would assist in putting a stop to U.S. involvement in the war.
“The real decision was primarily in 1969 when I became aware that President Nixon didn’t have in mind ending the war as he had campaigned on,” Ellsberg said. “I felt a responsibility to go beyond what I otherwise would have done to try and end it, and liberate us from that war. I felt that I should do what I could and that included putting out those 7,000 pages of history.”
Ellsberg first delivered the papers to members of Congress, hoping they would spark Congressional hearings. However, after his efforts to release the information through official channels failed, Ellsberg decided to take the material to The New York Times reporter Neil Sheehan in 1971.
Ellsberg said he believed at the time he might go to prison. However, he felt that the opportunity to potentially end U.S. involvement in Vietnam was worth the risk.
“I wanted to generate an effect – for the war to end. And it didn’t do that,” Ellsberg said. “It was a miraculous set of circumstances that happened together which kept me from going to prison.”

Unsung Heroes is expanding nationwide from its Georgetown roots to include more than 10 different chapters at universities across the country starting at the end of March.
Schools including Syracuse University, Emory University, the University of California, Los Angeles and American University, will all start Unsung Heroes chapters.
Unsung Heroes was launched at Georgetown in April 2016 as an initiative to spotlight university staff to spread awareness of their backgrounds and help them achieve their goals.
The group’s founder, Febin Bellamy (MSB ’17), started working with schools in the fall to ensure the successful rollout of new Unsung Heroes chapters. According to Bellamy, the process of expanding the organization is akin to franchising, as each chapter is required to be follow the same structure and guidelines, but is allowed to help workers in different ways.
“Even though they’re a chapter, they’re another arm, they represent our brand. We give them our handbook,” Bellamy said. “It’s like Starbucks or Subway — the same concept, same model. Maybe a different sandwich if you get approval, but relatively the same concept.”
Director of Expansion for Unsung Heroes Elizabeth Nalunga (SFS ’19)  said while each of the other chapters will have a certain degree of autonomy, current leadership of Unsung Heores at Georgetown is planning on staying connected with each of the chapters to provide advice and materials to create a community of those involved.
“That’s one of the beautiful things about working on the expansion part of Unsung Heroes,” Nalunga said. “We’re really part of a community where people are able to stay in touch, students are able to communicate with other students.”
Each chapter must receive club recognition from their school administration before they are invited join Unsung Heroes. Bellamy said the requirement will help ensure each chapter remains open more than one or two years.
“We’re making sure the official chapters will be here to stay,” Bellamy said. “The way we confirm an official chapter is through club recognition. Once they receive the recognition from the school saying Unsung Heroes is now an official club, then they get the stamp of approval.”
While Unsung Heroes received interest from at least 40 schools, only 10 were able to clear the application process, which requires applicants to complete an online questionnaire.
Nalunga said the organization is still working to create future partnerships with students from the schools that did not meet the initial application requirements.
“We have 10 schools we are working with closely and intensely right now to start their chapters by middle to late March,” Nalunga said. “Then we have another 20 or so schools we are working with, but they are in the beginning stages of getting their chapters on board.”
Unsung Heroes CFO Precious King (SFS ’20) said that she and Bellamy were working on creating a national board of directors to help the organization grow further. The board will help coordinate a national fundraising campaign for workers, in which Unsung Heroes will require each affiliate chapter to do two fundraising campaigns for workers at their universities.
“Every national chapter needs a board of directors,” King said. “If you looked at past companies that were started and moving up, they need to have an advisory group that can guide you, that’s there for advice and support — someone to go back to.”
King said she hopes Unsung Heroes is able to develop greater appreciation for workers at universities across the nation.
“Our goal is to make it a lifestyle for people to recognize the world around you and interact with workers you see on a daily basis, not disregard them,” King said. “To be able to expand that vision around the nation, we’re looking forward to that.”

The Washington, D.C. Council is considering proposals to reform the Youth Rehabilitation Act after a series of investigations conducted by The Washington Post found that the policy failed to prevent young criminals from committing crimes in the future.
The Youth Rehabilitation Act gives convicted criminals younger than 22 the opportunity to have their criminal record erased if they serve their sentence or complete their probation. In some cases, the act is used to grant eligible defendants a shorter sentence, given the crime is not a homicide or a second act of violence committed while armed.
Criminal justice reform advocates argue the intended effect is to give inexperienced offenders the opportunity to turn their life around and have a second chance.
The Washington Post found that at least 750 offenders have been sentenced more than once under the Youth Act in the past decade, and that since 2010, judges have given approximately 2,300 Youth Act sentences to accused individuals with weapon offenses or violent crimes.
Reform efforts have received support from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine and the D.C. council. Bowser has asked the council to finish its review of the act by July 2017 and recommend changes to make it more efficient in reforming young offenders and keeping the D.C. community safe.
Implemented in 1985 under former Mayor Marion Barry, the act aims to protect black youths from the stigma attached to lengthy prison sentences. At that time, the District controlled its own prison.
In 1997, the Federal Bureau of Prisons took over responsibility for all long-term offenders in the District in the 1997 Revitalization Act.
The District is still home to the D.C. Jail, a correctional facility that houses pre-trial offenders, sentenced and convicted felons awaiting transfer to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Only male offenders are housed at the D.C. Jail. Female offenders and juveniles being adjudicated as adults are housed at the Correctional Treatment Facility in southeast D.C.
In an interview with The Hoya, Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) said the Youth Act is not as successful as it should be and should be reformed because it can push District residents out of the city.
“Youths are put into prison in a way that is inhumane,” Grosso said. “We then expect them to miraculously be productive, engaged, law-abiding members of society when we put them through that tremendous challenge.”
While The Washington Post focused on the Youth Act as the main stumbling block in keeping District neighborhoods safe from young criminals, Grosso said many councilmembers find fault with the lack of preventative measures that would keep said offenders out of prison in the first place.
“We should be investing in our residents upfront — early in their mental health, early in their physical health — in order for them to be successful, not turning a blind eye to their needs and then wondering why they commit a crime, go up and become worse in jail and then come back and commit more crimes,” Grosso said.
Currently, the Youth Act does not require prisoners to undergo rehabilitation programs before re-entering society.
In an interview with The Hoya, Georgetown’s Prison and Justice Initiative Director Marc Howard, who is also a government and law department professor, echoed Grosso’s issue with the split in local and federal authority and its consequences for young offenders.
“That’s a huge handicap for them, which makes their re-entry really difficult. They’re really far away, they’re completely disconnected, they don’t have lasting ties, plus there’s very little programming and opportunity for rehabilitation inside,” Howard said. “They come back and unfortunately they’re not prepared, they’re not ready to re-enter society successfully and safely and the consequences are really clear.”
Previous Youth Act offenders have accounted for 1 in 5 homicide suspects since 2010, and there have been multiple examples of previous Youth Act offenders going on to commit rape, armed robbery and shootings — according to the Post’s findings.
One case highlighted in The Washington Post’s investigation was that of Youth Act offender Antwon Pitt. While spending two years in Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Florida for armed robbery, he committed 20 documented sexual offenses, which could have added 10 years to his prison sentence.
However, due to a lack of communication between the prison authority and the D.C. government, he was sent on a bus back to the District the same day he was found guilty of the said sexual assault charges. Two months after returning to D.C., he raped a woman at her home on Oct. 15, 2016, having cut off his GPS bracelet days before.
Pitt was considered to have completed his Youth Act sentence successfully, despite the infractions in prison.
One solution proposed by the D.C. Council includes building a new jail that would keep inmates closer to their support systems, therefore improving their chances of re-entry success after completing a Youth Act sentence.
“I firmly believe that we should bring home all D.C. residents that are in the Bureau Prison System,” Grosso said.
Grosso pointed to initiatives like the Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results Act, passed March 2016, which addresses violent crime within the D.C. community by assisting those most likely to commit violent acts with finding a job, suitable housing and treatment for mental and physical health problems.
However, Grosso said this plan has not been funded, which suggests any reforms could face a struggle in receiving city budget funding.
“There is an appetite here in the council to work on these issues and a small appetite in the mayor’s office to work on these issues. It’s just hard to get people to focus on those amongst us who are having the toughest time in life and it frustrates me,” Grosso said. “We’ll see; the Mayor sends down her budget on April 4, and on April 4, we’ll know.”

Students have launched the Tombstone Restoration Initiative to raise $1,200 in the next two months to restore the identifiable tombstones of members of the 272 slaves whom Georgetown sold in 1838.
Ayodele Aruleba (COL ’17) and Milan Chang (COL ’17) launched the project in conjunction with the Georgetown Memory Project, which helps to identify living descendants of the 272 slaves.
The funds are devoted to restoring the grave of Lucy Merrick, one of the 272 slaves sold in 1838, which has been damaged and neglected. Merrick was sold at age 10 and lived until 1903, but has no direct descendants to help with the upkeep.
Any money raised beyond the stated goal of $1,200 will be used to help restore gravestones of other slaves besides Lucy Merrick. The gravestones set to be restored are located at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church Graveyard in Maringouin, L.a .
Students are selling wristbands provided by the Georgetown Memory Project for $2.72 each starting yesterday.
Aruleba, a member of the Working Group on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation, said buying a wristband to pay for the tombstone restorations is a way for students to contribute to the reconciliation of the university’s history with slavery.
“One of the things I recognized was how students came to me, a member of the working group, and said, ‘How can I get involved? I` read the report and it was moving, but as a student, what can we do now?’” Aruleba said. “This is part of the answer.”
Aruleba said he anticipates the approximately 500 wristbands required to reach the fundraising goal will be sold quickly with help from faculty and students.
“We expect it to take about a month and a half, but with the help of faculty and staff and campus outreach, we think it could take a lot shorter,” Aruleba said. “We’re already getting a lot of people excited about it and putting it into club newsletters.”
Richard Cellini (COL ’84, LAW ’87), founder of the Georgetown Memory Project, said the idea for the Tombstone Initiative came from his discussions with descendants of the 272 slaves, many of whom live in Maringouin.
“Of the 1100 people who live in Maringouin today, about 900 are descendants of the Georgetown slaves,” Cellini said. “It’s a whole town, the whole town is basically direct descendants of Georgetown slaves.”
Cellini said student engagement is key to the effort’s success.
“Any member of the Georgetown alumni could write a check for $1,200, but that’s not the goal here,” Cellini said. “The goal is to raise it in small amounts and with a large number of participants.”
Chang, who originally reached out to the Georgetown Memory Project to see if students could help raise money, said that coordination with the Georgetown Memory Project was a student run effort.
“The university is not involved; part of the significance of this initiative is its student-led nature,” Chang wrote in an e-mail to The Hoya. “By working from the ground up, this project is meant to demonstrate the student body’s support of and dedication to an issue that is deeply personal to this community.”
According to Chang, buying a wristband helps shows understanding of the role slavery played in Georgetown’s success.
“Student engagement and community support show that Georgetown students recognize the university’s role in history, and strive to build upon this history in a constructive and meaningful manner,” Chang wrote. “This effort goes beyond a university statement.”

About 300 students have signed a petition to make Georgetown the first U.S. Catholic university to sponsor a family of refugees as part of new refugee advocacy group Heed the Call.
The petition, launched Feb. 21, has been endorsed by the Georgetown University College Democrats, Georgetown University College Republicans, Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition, and former Georgetown University Student Association candidates Garet Williams (COL ’18) and Habon Ali (SFS ’18).
Max Rosner (COL ’18) founded Heed the Call in September 2016 as a grassroots, student-led effort to organize a university sponsorship of a refugee family.
The organization’s name references Pope Francis’ 2015 call to followers to take in a refugee family. In September 2015, the Vatican sponsored a refugee family and has since taken in more families.
Heed the Call at Georgetown is also part of the nationwide “Every Campus a Refuge” movement, which aims to echo Pope Francis’ message.
Rosner first began working with the Georgetown administration last year, but gained traction this year after the signing of President Donald Trump’s January executive order banning all refugee admissions into the United States temporarily and Syrian refugees indefinitely.
“Going through that process takes a long time, and, sadly but luckily, with the executive order, much more attention on this issue emerged,” Rosner said.
According to Rosner, the administration had raised questions about whether it would be possible for an institution like Georgetown to take on a refugee family. Rosner said nine institutions sponsoring refugees, including Guilford College and Wake Forest University, have proven it is.
Holy Trinity Catholic Church, located blocks from the university on 36th Street NW, recently took in a refugee family. The family arrived last week after a monthslong effort by the church community to bring them to the United States. The church worked with an organization called Lutheran Social Services to match with a refugee family. Holy Trinity pastor Fr. Kevin Gillespie, who was involved in bringing the refugee family to the United States, said bringing the family took a concerted effort.
“There were around six committees organizing around transportation, food, law, diapers — all sorts of things. Our students got involved, the children at the school. Girl Scouts were in charge of diapers for the 1-year-old. It takes a village to adopt a family,” Gillespie said.
Although the sponsorship has worked well so far for both the Holy Trinity community and the refugee family, Gillespie said such an undertaking may be more difficult for an educational institution like Georgetown.
“Certainly, we welcome students to get involved and advocate and sponsor programs. It’s pretty complicated in terms of financial resources. We have immigration lawyers, we have state department people rallying, we have people donating. I think we’ve raised over $70,000. For students, I think the student call may be in a different direction,” Gillespie said.
Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., director of the Center for Latin American Studies, has worked with many of the Jesuits involved in Holy Trinity’s refugee efforts, and expressed his concern for the level of commitment it would require from the university.
“Holy Trinity has an advantage. It’s a parish that is stable that can be there over the long haul, and even though pastors come and go, there’s a way where the community stays for a long time,” Carnes said. “I would want to make sure that every last detail was worked out before you take it on because it would be unfair to the family to not be absolutely sure that you can accompany them for the long haul.”
Like Gillespie, Carnes also stressed the importance of students getting involved.
“We have a huge moral responsibility to be doing this and I think it’s great that students are doing it,” Carnes said.
Ali called on students to come together in solidarity for refugees.
“From the Women’s March we saw that when we stand in solidarity, regardless of your religion or sexuality, any background that you come from, it really makes a stand,” Ali said. “Standing up for refugees, living in a community in the Jesuit values, it’s our job to do so and it’s our job to be there. We are men and women for others; let us not just say that, but really be there for people.”
She called on more student organizations to advocate for the petition.
“It’s time for an organization such as GUSA to really take a stance on this,” Ali said. “Collectively, Georgetown students really understand the need to do something, and I am so happy that these groups came up with this initiative and are pushing for it.”
GUCD President Meredith Forsyth (SFS ’19) said the initiative is an opportunity for Georgetown to make a difference on an international issue.
“It’s a really, really important issue and it’s a great opportunity for Georgetown to take a stand and really live up to our Jesuit values here and heed the call of Pope Francis back from last September,” Forsyth said.
Ali said it falls upon the entire community to support refugees.
“As a refugee myself, at the end of the day we are all privileged,” Ali said. “I am privileged to be here, and it’s realizing that when you’re privileged with something it’s time to give back.”

The Georgetown University Medical Center’s Institute for Reproductive Health partnered with Cycle Technologies to conduct a yearlong study in real time, the first of its kind, on a fertility tracking smartphone app to determine its effectiveness and accuracy in determining a woman’s chance for pregnancy, announced Feb. 7.
The app, called Dynamic Optimal Timing, or Dot, aggregates information without external equipmemt from thousands of women to provide users their likelihood of becoming pregnant on any given day. Preliminary trials conducted over 13 menstrual cycles showed that app to be approximately 96 percent effective in identifying a woman’s fertile window.
The study is funded by a grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development. A previous study published June 2016, in which Georgetown’s department of obstetrics and gynecology participated, found that Dot is theoretically 96 to 98 percent effective at avoiding unintended pregnancy when used correctly.
According to the study protocol written by IRH Director Dr. Victoria Jennings, IRH Senior Research Officer Dominick Shattuck and IRH senior research professor Rebecca Simmons on Jan. 18, about 222 million women worldwide want to avoid pregnancy but are not using a contraceptive method.
These contraceptive needs could potentially be met by providing information about the days in a woman’s menstrual cycle that she is most likely to become pregnant.
“Making these methods available to women through their mobile phones can facilitate access,” the study reads.
The effort plans on recruiting as many as 1,200 women to participate in the study, and will follow them over the course of 13 menstrual periods. Recruitment began in January of this year, and preliminary results are expected in September 2018.
Dot was developed by Cycle Technologies to help women who seek to either prevent or plan a pregnancy. Cycle Technologies released the app in the Apple App Store in August 2015.
Jennings, who is leading the research, said the study will be the first efficacy study of a fertility app that aims to meet the standard criteria for typical contraceptive efficacy studies.
“We decided to work on something that was very evidence-based and to apply the same standards for an efficacy trial that would be applied to any other method of birth control,” Jennings said.
Cycle Technologies President Leslie Heyer said she believes this type of study is crucial to the development of effective fertility planning apps.
“Doing an efficacy study like this is critical,” Heyer said. “You really want to be able to compare the efficacy and understand how women are using it.”
Simmons said she believes the app increases reproductive education accessibility for those who are low-income or do not have access to reproductive health education.
“By creating an app that’s easily accessible by women all over the world inside and outside of the health system, we’ve essentially increased the availability — and hopefully the uptake — for women who don’t want to use hormonal methods but also don’t have the time or funds or education levels to really learn from an instructor who might teach them about natural methods of family planning,” Simmons said.
According to Jennings, her research team will also collect information on any social factors that may be related to an individual woman’s use of Dot, such as how the app might affect a couple’s relationship and if a woman tires of using the app.
Jennings said participants will be interviewed four times in the yearlong study, and will be prompted to answer survey questions on the app.
Cycle Technologies is a social impact company focused on women’s health. They have already developed two other fertility planning tools, Cyclebeads and 2Day Method.
According to Heyer, simplicity is the focus of all the company’s apps.
“We are very focused on providing couples with simple, effective tools that will help them manage their fertility,” Heyer said.
Heyer said Cycle Technologies hopes to use technological advances to both personalize fertility tracking and make it more accessible to women across the globe.
With Dot, Heyer said she hopes Cycle Technologies will be able to tailor information to each woman based on her menstrual cycle.
Heyer also mentioned that the development of smartphone technology makes fertility planning more accessible to women living in areas of the developing world.
“Being offered via smartphone means that we are able to access a lot more women,” Heyer said.
Simmons added that studying the app will provide information to women trying to decide on a method of birth control.
“It’s important that you evaluate it and test the efficacy of it because when a woman is deciding if she wants to use a method of family planning, she wants to know how effective it is in preventing pregnancy,” Simmons said.

Overcoming obstacles to achieve success is the most valuable aspect of competition, according to Olympians Charlie Buckingham (COL ’11) and Michelle Konkoly (COL ’15) in a talk in Copley Formal Lounge on Feb. 16.
Konkoly won four medals at the Rio 2016 Paralympics, including two golds in the 50 meters and 100m freestyle, while Buckingham placed 11th in the Laser sailing division at the Rio 2016 Olympics. The pair constitutes two of 47 Georgetown alumni who have competed in the Olympics.
Buckingham said that while success is temporary, the lessons learned in the experience leading up to Olympics are permanent.
“You experience that result for one second,” Buckingham said. “And when that’s gone, you feel pretty empty, so if the journey leading up to that has been all about the result, I think you’ve missed something.”
Konkoly was originally recruited to be part of Georgetown’s swimming team. But at the beginning of her freshman spring semester, she fell out of her dorm window on the fifth floor of Village C West, abruptly halting her collegiate swimming career. Rather than giving up on  swimming, Konkoly decided to try out for the Paralympics, which she said allowed her to work through her disability alongside others facing similar challenges.
“Georgetown offers so many things, but when I got to the Paralympics, I found this community of other athletes who did have physical disabilities,” Konkoly said. “So, it kind of filled that one little niche that was harder to find here.”
Instead of competing in another Paralympics, Konkoly plans on attending medical school and hopes to be able to work with children with disabilities after she graduates.
“I’d really like to do something with kids with disabilities,” Konkoly said. “Meeting my Paralympic teammates has really shown me that they are some of the most incredible people in the world, and I’d love to continue working with that patient population.”
Konkoly said although she will not be continuing to train and compete full-time, her time at Rio — like her time at Georgetown — is an experience that she will carry with her for the rest of her life.
“You’re an Olympian for life, just like you’re a Hoya for life, and being able to translate those lessons to your next step allows this to be such a more lasting experience,” Konkoly said.
Buckingham said his time on Georgetown’s sailing team provided him with the skills and inspiration to qualify for the Olympics.
“I always looked up to Olympic sailors, but it became a reality at Georgetown for sure,” Buckingham said. “When I came here and I learned what it took to become a better athlete, that’s when I feel I moved to the next level.”
Buckingham said that he is getting ready for the 2020 games in Tokyo.
“I’m already training for Tokyo,” Buckingham said. “When you are in the environment and you see what’s possible, I am driven to get that gold medal. I’m going to go for it until I get it.”

Georgetown University Medical Center students launched a group last fall to raise awareness among medical students and administrators about the experiences of students without documentation.
The group, known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Undocumented Student Awareness Club, plans to educate medical students about the DACA program and their fellow students without documentation. The organization has accumulated 31 members since its creation.
DACA, a program launched by an Obama Administration executive order in 2012, permits some individuals without documentation who entered the country before their 16th birthday to be protected from deportation through a deferral in the deportation process.
Elaine Li (MED ’19), a student without documentation, was born in Hong Kong and immigrated to the United States as a child. Li said undocumented students were often denied entrance into medical schools as well as financial aid before the implementation of DACA.
“When I got the acceptance for Georgetown I was very happy, but at the same time it was quickly replaced by ‘Oh, how am I supposed to afford this?’ I don’t have money, I don’t have federal aid,” Li said.
However, Li said GUMC tried to help with this issue by providing her with institutional loans for which all GUMC students are eligible.
Undocumented Student Adviser Arelis Palacios, whom the university announced Nov. 2016 would replace part-time liaison Cinthya Salazar, said Georgetown is dedicated to providing resources to all students, regardless of legal status.
“This university has been committed to undocumented students for a little bit over a decade, and has been really supportive of students who are wanting to get this education,” Palacios said.
However, Palacios added that despite the university’s resources for students without documentation, their citizenship statuses still add day-to-day pressures.
“The challenges for this population are truly greater than your average student,” Palacios said. “The reality is that most students aren’t worried about being deported, most students aren’t worried about their families being deported, perhaps their families being detained indefinitely.”
Still, Aya De La Rosa (GRD ’20), an executive board member of the student group, said Georgetown can do more to support students without documentation, especially by informing prospective students what resources the university provides.
“They didn’t know you could actually go to graduate school, that you could go to medical school [or that] you could even get financial aid because, for example, at Georgetown it’s not publicized,” De La Rosa said. “They don’t make it public that that’s a thing that happens, but other schools do.”
According to Danny Flautero (GRD ’20), another executive board member of the organization, students themselves currently have to reach out to administrators to receive information about receiving financial aid or other information from the GUMC.
“Right now, students have to email the offices directly and say ‘Can I apply? What kinds of resources are there for me?’” Flautero said.
Flautero said the club also aims to share personal stories of struggles faced by students without documentation, especially in light of President Donald Trump’s promises to expand deportations of immigrants without documentation.
Li said the status of DACA and of older family members are a significant concern to club members.
“We have DACA, but our families don’t have [it.] A lot of us right now worry about our parents or adults who couldn’t qualify for DACA,” Li said.
De La Rosa said if Trump were to revoke the DACA program, many medical school graduates would be deported, despite their degrees or residency positions.
“One of the fears that I think I would have, especially now with the current government, is that you’re doing the whole medical school for nothing,” De La Rosa said. “You have DACA status right now — let’s say you finish medical school — but if you don’t have DACA status it might be like you just did medical school for nothing. What do you do after that?”
Flautero said the group has struggled to gain traction during its first few meetings, but is increasing outreach efforts.
“We’ve been a little bit frustrated with some of the turnout at our events. We try to publicize them pretty openly and early on,” Flautero said. “We put a lot of effort in. We’ve had events where like one person has shown up before, and for other events it’s the same people that keep coming, but we feel like we’re not reaching out.”

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, a private organization offering grants in part to colleges and universities, granted Georgetown University $1.5 million to help establish new racial justice initiatives on campus.
The grant, announced by Georgetown on Feb. 13, was received Dec. 8.
Starting in 2017, the grant will help fund two faculty positions, two postdoctoral fellows for two-year appointments, two five-year Patrick Healy Graduate Fellowships to graduate students in the humanities and a lecture series on racial justice.
Provost Robert Groves, professor Gwen Mikell and associate professor Robert Patterson, who are all co-chairs for the Working Group on Racial Justice, submitted the proposal.
Groves said the grant will help Georgetown achieve its goal of researching racial justice.
“Georgetown is committed to expanding scholarship to address the persistent, enduring legacy of racism and segregation in the American experience,” Groves wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Mellon Foundation, by this grant, helps us advance this work to support new faculty positions, funding for graduate students and further scholarship and engagement.”
According to Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh, the money will also support the university’s efforts to address its history with slavery. The university benefitted from the sale of 272 slaves to a Louisiana plantation in 1838.
“A center for racial justice could also include an academic home for researching slavery and its legacies, as recommended by the Working Group on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation and is something the racial justice working group is exploring,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
These advances come at a time of increased discussion of racial justice in the political sphere and renewed attention regarding the university’s historical relationship with slavery. Last year, University President John J. DeGioia announced the university would remove the names of two campus buildings, named after University President Fr. Thomas Mulledy, S.J., who authorized the sale of 272 slaves to a Louisiana plantation in 1838, and former University President Fr. William McSherry, S.J., who served as Mulledy’s lawyer during the sale.
The structures are now named for Isaac Hawkins, one of the slaves sold in 1838, and Anne Marie Becraft, the founder of a school in Georgetown for black girls in the 19th century.
The Mellon Foundation has a long history with Georgetown University. Its mission is to promote the humanities for diverse and democratic societies. The foundation gave its first grant to the university in 1970, and has given over 30 grants since then. This most recent grant was the largest ever — at three times larger than the second-largest grant.
The foundation’s co-chairs will coordinate the use of its funds.
The Mellon Foundation categorized the grant to Georgetown as part of its Diversity Program, which aims to support initiatives that diversify the faculty of higher education institutes and to help universities that strive to expand the attainability of education for historically underrepresented groups.
Vice President of Advancement Bart Moore (SFS ’87) said the grant symbolizes a potential for future methods of funding new academic programs.
“We’re very pleased to have received this grant, mainly because it will support very important work on racial justice,” Moore wrote in an email to The Hoya. “But also because it embodies the increasing role we anticipate institutional philanthropy will play in funding specific strategic ambitions that advance the academic mission of the university.”
