The university will present a proposal for redevelopment of Walter Reed Army Medical Center at a community open house July 18, Chief Operating Officer Christopher Augostini, Provost Robert Groves and School of Medicine Executive Dean Howard Federoff announced in a campus-wide email Friday.
Walter Reed, located at 6900 Georgia Ave., NW, was the largest military medical center in the country before it ceased operations in August 2011. In January 2013, the District announced it would open 66.57 acres of the site for development into a community containing a town center, new offices, homes, shopping, housing and arts and entertainment venues. The U.S. Department of State will use the remaining 43.53 acres as a Foreign Missions Center.
The university partnered with architectural firm Forest City Washington to create a proposal that incorporates graduate education, research and collaboration with nonprofits and other organizations.
The university is one of nine design teams competing for the bid and will also consider the former St. Elizabeths Hospital at 1100 Alabama Ave., SE, as another area for possible expansion.
“While recognizing that our historic main campus has limited space, we believe that future growth is necessary for our institutional health and sustainability,” Augostini, Groves and Federoff wrote.
