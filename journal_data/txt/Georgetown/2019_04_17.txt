Dylan Hughes (COL ’19), former chair of the Georgetown University Student Association Ethics and Oversight Committee, challenged the constitutionality of GUSA Constitutional Council Chief Justice William Morris’ (COL ’19) extended tenure in an email April 17. 
Hughes was one of two parties named in a suit filed by Rowan Saydlowski (COL ’21) and Chris Castaldi-Moller (SFS ’21) to the Constitutional Council on April 14 seeking to overturn the results of last week’s GU272 referendum. (Full Disclosure: Saydlowski currently serves on The Hoya’s editorial board.) The Constitutional Council, GUSA’s interpretive body, is set to hear arguments from all parties named in the complaint in a meeting Wednesday evening. 
Justices sitting on the Constitutional Council during their graduation year must immediately tender their resignations once the results of that year’s executive elections are certified, according to GUSA bylaws. President Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Vice President Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) were sworn in March 16, and thus Morris is holding the position of chief justice illegally, according to Hughes. 
While the Constitutional Council will reach a decision on the case after Easter break, that decision might be illegitimate because of Morris’ wrongful position, according to Hughes. 
“We fear any decision on this case could be held as invalid because the quorum on the Council may be illegal,” Hughes wrote in the email. “We want to make sure this situation is remedied before the hearing and drafting and publication of the opinion.” 
Students voted overwhelmingly in favor of a referendum to establish a semesterly fee that would go toward a fund allocated to descendants of the GU272, the 272 enslaved people sold by the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus in 1838 to financially sustain the university.
Morris sent a three-page response email defending his position as chief justice an hour after Hughes’ email April 17. Morris volunteered to resign in March but reached an agreement with former GUSA President Juan Martinez (SFS ’20) and Francis that he would maintain his position until the conclusion of the senate election and GU272 referendum, according to his email.
A consensus was reached among Martinez, Francis and Hughes that Morris would extend his term until the end of the semester, according to Morris.
“Collectively, we determined that it would be best for me to stay on as Chief Justice to handle any issues that would arise, with the understanding that I would resign following the conclusion of all election/referendum issues this spring,” Morris wrote.
Morris planned to resign April 14 when the new senate was sworn in but decided to stay after Saydlowski and Castaldi-Moller filed their suit, according to Morris. He is now committed to overseeing the rest of the suit and and does not intend to resign, Morris wrote.
“If I legitimately believed that I was unfit to hold this office, I would still resign immediately. Yet as I have outlined, I have no biases, no questions of competency, and no ignorance of this situation,” Morris wrote. “Up to Saturday, I was prepared to resign at a moment’s notice. But since accepting this case, I have become committed to seeing it through.”
Continuing the delay or undermining the hearing of the case on technical questions of his position would be unfair to students, according to Morris. 
“I know that this case touches a lot of issues that people are very passionate about; as such, regardless of our decision, many students will be unsatisfied with the outcome,” Morris wrote. “But they still deserve an outcome. This case should not be delayed or postponed based on technicalities.”

One doesn’t tenure their resignation. One tenders their resignation.

After months of negotiations, Georgetown University food service workers reached a tentative contract agreement with Aramark, the university’s food service provider, on April 15. 
Student activists and other community members celebrated at a victory rally in Red Square on Tuesday in honor of the tentative agreement between Aramark and Unite Here, the labor union representing Georgetown food service workers. Rally attendees included members of the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees, Georgetown Solidarity Committee and Georgetown students, among others. Unite Here union members at Georgetown voted unanimously to ratify the contact in a 105-0 vote, according to Joshua Armstead, vice president of the D.C. chapter of Unite Here.
Before the agreement, GSC, a student group dedicated to promoting workers’ rights, had planned a protest for justice outside O’Donovan Hall in support of Georgetown food service workers with the goal of calling attention to the ongoing negotiations. But the event was reorganized as a rally following a tentative agreement between Aramark and Unite Here at the Georgetown Hotel and Conference Center on Monday night. The full details of the agreement have not yet been released.
Contract renegotiations began after the labor contract between Aramark and Unite Here expired in December. The workers first attempted to appeal their contracts through Unite Here in January, but Aramark returned their proposal without meeting their demands. Following a second failed appeal in February, the workers protested Aramark on Feb. 27 and April 4, citing low wages, short break times and disrespectful management.
Georgetown workers’ experience will improve because of the new contract terms, according to Armstead, who spoke at the rally.
“We wanted to get a real deal that propelled ourselves to a future where we can live in D.C., where we can work with pride, in the face of a multibillion dollar company, and we got that last night,” Armstead said in an interview with The Hoya.
The new contract terms include worker raises, affordable healthcare and civil rights protections, according to Armstead’s April 15 statement in the “Victory Rally!!!!!” Facebook event. 
Unite Here workers on Georgetown’s campus had the opportunity to vote on the terms of the contract in Leo’s April 16, and in the Leavey Center on April 17. The results of the ratification vote were not counted by the union until all the votes were cast, Armstead said.  
Union members acknowledged the role student activists played throughout the process of reaching a new contract agreement, according to Armstead.
“We, as workers, are proud to have won this, and even more humbled that students answered our calls for solidarity, demonstrating that workers and students are united in demanding justice,” Armstead wrote in the Facebook event.
Fr. Raymond Kemp, a D.C. community fellow at Georgetown’s Center for Social Justice and adjunct theology professor, spoke at the end of the rally. As April 16 also marks the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” Kemp recognized the connection in his remarks at the rally. 
The contract agreement came about as a result of pushback by union members, according to Kemp. 
“We need to give thanks to all the activists, all the radicals, all the organizers in our life,” Kemp said in his speech. “We need to understand that by creating tension around things that are right and good and true, and especially getting rid of unjust situations and unjust causes, we’re walking in the footsteps of those people.” 
This is a developing story. This post will be updated as more information becomes available.

The Blommer Science Library will close permanently and its materials will be relocated to Lauinger Library within the next six to 12 months, the dean of the Georgetown University Library announced in an email to faculty April 8. 
The transfer of materials from Blommer to Lau is in preparation for the planned renovation of the Reiss Science Building, according to Katherine Thomas, the library’s communications and marketing coordinator. 
“Planning and Facilities Management will address maintenance needs and renovate the Reiss Science Building, so Blommer Science Library materials and services will be permanently relocated to Lauinger Library by June 2020,” Thomas wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Blommer has suffered from flooding and damaged materials, largely attributable to the building’s poor condition, according to Blommer student worker Rebecca Hollister (COL ’21). Plans to renovate Reiss have existed since at least 2013, when university officials discussed the future of the building at an Old Georgetown Board meeting. 
Blommer, named after alumnus Henry Blommer (C ’26), contains 66,000 books and bound periodicals, which make up the majority of Georgetown’s science reserves, according to the library. Located in Reiss, the library opened in 1962 as the second university library, following Riggs Library. 
Details of the planned relocation are still being developed, Harriette Hemmasi, dean of the library, wrote in the email sent to faculty. 
“We will share more information about this as it becomes available, but please know that the Library’s highest priority is providing excellent resources and services to the University community,” Hemmasi wrote. “The intent of this plan is not to reduce either of these, but to streamline our efforts to provide a high-quality research environment.”
The university is still determining which collections will remain on campus in Lau and which will be stored off campus at the Washington Research Library Consortium’s Shared Collections Facility. The library plans to field input from several faculty members and university representatives during the upcoming months to determine which materials to keep on campus, Thomas wrote. The library will also host an open forum early this fall to address concerns, according to Hemmasi.
Although the relocation should not cause any significant disruption to the student population as a whole, concerns remain regarding its effect on the students who frequently use Blommer, according to Hollister.
“Often there will be Blommer ‘regulars’ who I see in the library daily, so they will certainly be the most impacted,” Hollister wrote in an email to The Hoya. “However, I think that the impact on the community at large will be relatively small.”
While the number of students using Blommer may be limited, it provides important resources to students, according to Hollister. The library’s reference librarians are available for students with science related inquiries, and Blommer has hosted science creativity projects, such as a haiku competition.
While students may be unable to access library materials during the transition period, the library plans to ensure as few students are hindered by the transfer as possible, according to Thomas.
“During the transfer of items, certain materials may be unavailable for a brief period of time. The Library is working to schedule this transfer carefully to ensure minimal disruption,” Thomas wrote. “This project is still in the development stage, and additional communication will be forthcoming as more information about the impact of this transition is available.”
While some have expressed concerns over the availability of these STEM resources, they will still be accessible via request in HoyaSearch, the library’s search engine, according to Thomas.
Student workers were told that the relocation of materials from Blommer to Lau intends to increase efficiency, according to Hollister. As scientific materials are currently located at both libraries, the transfer aims to facilitate and centralize the process of acquiring research materials.
“We were told that this process would eventually help streamline research processes, not reduce any amount of materials available,” Hollister wrote.

Seven women were among the 18 students officially sworn in as newly elected senators of the 2019-20 Georgetown University Student Association in a weekly meeting Sunday, marking a rise in representation for women compared to previous elections.
The female senators sworn into the 2019-20 GUSA senate represent a significant demographic shift from the 2018-19 senate makeup. During the last GUSA senate elections, which filled 14 senate seats in October, the student body elected only one woman, Hayley Grande (COL ’21), who lost reelection this term. Additionally, the 2018-19 senate included an all-male freshman class.
Newly elected rising sophomore senator Olivia Kleier (SFS ’22) hopes to improve campus inclusivity and well-being during her tenure. Female representation in student government is important because it more accurately reflects the makeup of the campus community, according to Kleier.
“It is really amazing just because it is representing more of the student body on campus and that women will be able to have a voice for the senate as well,” Kleier said in an interview with The Hoya. “It is really a momentous occasion for me to be a part of.” 
Female representation in the GUSA senate will also provide valuable new perspectives on a variety of  issues, according to newly elected rising sophomore senator Zev Burton (SFS ’22). 
“When you have women being elected to the senate being able to voice their concerns, it does two things: First, it offers a perspective that a lot of men can’t have,” Burton said in an interview with The Hoya. “Additionally, it serves as a sense of empowerment.”
A student referendum to establish a semesterly fee to benefit descendants of the GU272, which passed with 66.1 approval, was attached to the senate elections held by the GUSA election commission April 11. Last week’s election broke GUSA election turnout records, with 57.9 percent of undergraduates voting.
GUSA Vice President Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) will serve as senate speaker until the senate votes to replace former speaker Eliza Lafferty (COL ’21) and vice speaker Patrick Walsh (SFS ’21) on April 16, according to GUSA executive press secretary Harper Thomas (SFS ’22). The vote will determine a transition chair and transition vice chair to serve for the transition period over the summer. The transition positions will be vacated in the fall and replaced by a speaker and vice speaker elected in the first meeting of the senate following the swearing in of the fall class of senators.
Walsh, who served in the GUSA senate for the past year, did not run for reelection. Looking ahead, the incoming senate class should look to pursue meaningful, achievable policy goals, according to Walsh. 
“I am hoping that the senate continues to try to focus on tangible issues that are working towards helping people on campus, supporting people on campus, supporting advocates on campus,” Walsh said in an interview with The Hoya.
Among the senators reelected was former GUSA president Juan Martinez (COL ’20). Martinez served as the speaker of the GUSA senate in fall 2018 until he assumed the role of GUSA president after the resignations of former President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19), Vice President Naba Rahman (SFS ’19), Chief of Staff Aaron Bennett (COL ’19) and nine other members of the GUSA executive. Nair resigned Sept. 11 amid sexual misconduct allegations.
No complaints had been filed against Nair through the Title IX office or the Office of Student Conduct, he wrote in a May 28 email to The Hoya. A university spokesperson confirmed that, as of May 2019, Nair was not the subject of any complaints through either office nor had he been found responsible for any violations of the Student Code of Conduct.
The five new rising sophomore senators sworn in include Daniella Sanchez (COL ’22), Zev Burton (SFS ’22), Layla Weiss (MSB ’22), Olivia Kleier (SFS ’22), Julia Moreno (SFS ’22) and Leo John Arnett (SFS ’22), who won reelection. 
Newly elected rising juniors Natalie Kim (SFS ’21), Mikail Husain (COL ’21), Joshua Marin-Mora (SFS ’21) and Leo Teixeira (COL ’21) were sworn in on Sunday, joining reelected senators Sam Dubke (SFS ’21) and Samantha Moreland (MSB ’21). 
Rising seniors Jessica Richards (COL ’20), Peter Lee Hamilton (COL ’20), Miguel Zambudio (COL ’20) and Martinez also officially joined reelected senators Harrison Nugent (SFS ’20) and Matt Buckwald (COL ’20).
The elections also come after the formation of Abolish GUSA, a movement seeking to replace GUSA with a more efficient and inclusive system of student government, emerged during the GUSA executive elections in February. Three of the senate candidates in last week’s elections publicly affiliated themselves with the Abolish GUSA movement throughout their campaign, though none of them won their senate races.
The 2019-20 GUSA senate should work to rebuild trust in GUSA by bridging the gap between GUSA and student constituents, according to Burton. 
“I really like to take notes whenever I have conversations with people about what they want, so I’m doing that and trying to put that into policies and maintaining open and constant communication,” Burton said. “That’s how you restore trust, by not making GUSA on some elevated pedestal which some people have in the past.” 
This article was updated July 2 to indicate the absence of Title IX or Office of Student Conduct complaints against Nair and to include comment from Nair.
