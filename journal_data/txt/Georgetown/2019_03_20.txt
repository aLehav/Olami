Georgetown University Student Association President Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Vice President Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) are emphasizing approachability and student engagement as they begin their term in the GUSA executive.
The pair were sworn in March 16 following the GUSA senate’s confirmation of the election results Feb. 10. Francis and Olvera were elected Feb. 8 by a margin of 40 votes, narrowly defeating solo candidate Nicki Gray (NHS ’20) in an election that saw the lowest voter turnout in seven years.
Francis and Olvera’s priorities for the semester follow their campaign pillars of diversity, transparency and academic accessibility. 
The executives said they will increase opportunities for students to engage with GUSA during their term.
“That’s one thing that we really want to do is make sure we are as approachable as possible,” Francis said. “So another thing that we want to start implementing is town halls that we’ve seen from other executives, most recently the last elected executives, that was one thing that they wanted to implement and that’s something that we’re looking to as well.”
Francis and Olvera are replacing former GUSA President Juan Martinez (SFS ’20) and former GUSA Vice President Kenna Chick (SFS ’20). The biggest challenge facing the new executives is translating their plan for incorporating student voices into action, Martinez said in his March 14 exit interview with The Hoya.
Francis and Olvera, who ran on a platform of transparency, reform, accessibility and progress, abbreviated as T.R.A.P., hoped to prioritize outreach to student groups and focused on diversity while assembling their senior staff over the past couple of weeks. 
“One thing that we really tried to make a thing was trying to reach out to as many student groups as possible,” Francis said. “Also, we tried to message out to different student groups, especially cultural groups, so that they knew that this was an option that they could look into and that they were able to apply.” 
The pair hopes to promote diverse candidates to run for the April 11 elections to the GUSA senate during their term, according to Olvera.
“Especially when time for senate elections comes around, we’re going to encourage people to run that probably wouldn’t have ran previously because they see how the majority demographic is represented,” Olvera said. “But with us as executives, we’re really pushing to make sure that we’re as inclusive as possible because we know what it feels like to be alienated in these white spaces.”
As vice president, Olvera plans to collaborate with members of GUSA’s policy teams to prioritize academic accessibility in the pair’s term.
“I want to work very closely with the academic affairs chair to make sure that we’re thinking of everyone’s walk of life and make sure we are building a team that is once again inclusive of as many students as possible,” Olvera said. “So I’m going to be closely monitoring that policy chair because that’s something that’s really close to my heart.”
In response to concerns about a lack of stability and trust in GUSA, the pair plans to focus on connecting with student constituents, according to Francis.
“A big part of trust is also just sort of a lack of knowing someone, so I think that’s what a big push that we want to make this year with our communications team is definitely getting ourselves out there and basically integrating ourselves with the community,” Francis said. “That’s a big thing that we tried to stress during our interviews with our senior staff is basically how well are they going to be able to integrate themselves with students.”
GUSA has experienced instability in recent history with multiple executive resignations. Former GUSA Vice President Naba Rahman (SFS ’19) and 10 other executive cabinet members resigned Sept. 11 as part of a push to remove then-GUSA President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) from office. Nair officially resigned later that morning. 
More recently, vice presidential candidate Sam Appel (COL ’20) stepped down from the executive race and the GUSA senate Jan. 28. 
Francis and Olvera hope to hold the university administration to its word by choosing not to stand down on issues students deem important. 
“The way I’m going to hold administration accountable is I’m not afraid to make them feel uncomfortable with questions,” Olvera said. “I want them to know this is something we’re thinking about, and if we push them and put pressure on them in this way, even if they don’t feel comfortable with us pushing a certain agenda, we want to make sure that they’re hearing students want this.”
Francis looks forward to getting to know more students and increasing his visibility on campus so he can build trust with the Georgetown community. 
“I want folks to feel comfortable reaching out to any aspect of GUSA and feeling like work is going to be done that they can trust,” Francis said. “I realize that we might not be at that place right now, but I want to try to be there by the time that we finish.”

President Donald Trump’s fiscal year 2020 District of Columbia budget, released Monday, threatens to eliminate funding entirely for the D.C. Tuition Assistance Grant Program for the second year in a row.
The D.C. Tuition Grant Assistance Program provides educational grants for Washington, D.C. residents to attend universities around the country. After its funding became jeopardized under Trump’s requested FY 2019 budget, DCTAG ultimately received $40 million from Congress in the enacted budget. 
The requested 2020 D.C. budget once again seeks to end DCTAG, but Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) announced her opposition to the budget and continued support of the program in a Monday news release.
“Like last year, the President’s budget is dead on arrival in Congress,” Norton said. “We defeated most of these proposals last Congress and will do so again.”  
D.C. residents should not worry about the existence of grants that help them afford their college tuition, Norton said.
“DCTAG has always been funded every year by Republican and Democratic congresses alike and, until President Trump, Republican presidents as well,” Norton said. 
Currently, students can receive up to $2,500 in grants to cover tuition for private institutions and HBCUs in the D.C. area and up to $10,000 for public institutions across the country. As a nonprofit private university in D.C., Georgetown University is a DCTAG-eligible school.
The program has received $40 million in funding for the past four years, even as Trump has proposed eliminating the grants and as Congress initially proposed $30 million for DCTAG for FY 2019.
The program was enacted to help D.C. residents afford a college education, as they do not benefit from in-state tuition through state university systems. DCTAG is no longer necessary because of D.C.’s financial growth in the past 20 years, according to the budget. 
“While this program has helped many D.C. residents afford college, the financial position of the D.C. government has significantly improved since 1999 providing D.C. with flexibility to allocate local funds to support its residents,” the budget reads.
The proposed budget also contains four provisions which limit D.C.’s ability to self govern. These provisions, however, are down from the seven included in the 2019 proposed house budget. 
These provisions would restrict the District from spending its local funds on abortions, commercializing recreational marijuana, the death with dignity act, which allows terminally ill patients the decision to end their lives and the reproduction non-discrimination act. 
The proposed budget, however, leaves the potential for the District government to use funds not appropriated by this budget to pursue the commercialization of marijuana, according to Marijuana Moment. This provision was included in the 2019 budget, and Congress altered the language to restrict the district it from using any funds, eliminating this possibility.
Trump’s proposed cuts to DCTAG came the same day as Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) promised to increased spending to continue improving the district’s affordability and accessibility at her State of the District on Monday.
“These have been and continue to be very good times for Washington, D.C.,” Bowser said in her address. “To keep D.C. a city that works for both residents and businesses, in the coming fiscal year, we’re asking our commercial property owners to share some of the upside.”

Washington, D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) was reprimanded by a council vote after using his government email to solicit corporate deals March 19.
Beyond the reprimand, D.C. Council Chair Phil Mendelson (D-At Large) removed some of the responsibilities Evans holds as chair of the Committee on Finance and Revenue, but did not strip him from his position as chair of the committee. The additional changes will be voted on by the council in April, according to The Washington Post.
The punishment came after several organizations — such as the D.C. Democratic State Committee and D.C. Working Families, a progressive advocacy group that seeks to raise living standards for working families, — published open letters and petitions calling on Evans to resign.
The reprimand sends a clear message about the values of the council, according to D.C. Council Chair Phil Mendelson (D-At Large).
“The Council is acting swiftly and clearly to condemn the action by any member who uses government resources for personal business and who knowingly advertises the prestige of his office for private gain,” Mendelson said at the council’s March 19 legislative meeting.
The decision to reprimand Evans came after a grand jury subpoenaed documents relating to legislation benefiting Digi Outdoor Media, a digital commercial advertising firm, last September, as part of a federal investigation. Evans, the longest-serving member of the D.C. Council, allegedly used his influence and connections as councilmember to help solidify client deals, according to The Washington Post.
Mendelson announced he would introduce a resolution to reprimand Evans in a March 5 news release, but did not call on Evans to resign.
“Our Code of Conduct states explicitly that a Councilmember ‘may not knowingly use the prestige of office or public position for [his] private gain,’ and that government resources shall not be used for personal business,” Mendelson said. “This reprimand will send a clear message that Mr. Evans’ actions are not only unacceptable but are inconsistent with the Council’s ethical standards.”
As chair of the finance and revenue committee, Evans will retain his oversight of the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority and the D.C. Lottery, which regulates the recently approved mobile sports betting program. Changes to his influence in these agencies will be decided in a vote scheduled for April, according to The Washington Post. 
Evans, who faces the threat of a recall election if a recall petition receives 10 percent of the approximately 52,000 registered voters in Ward 2, should not be stripped of his chairmanship, according to Mendelson.
“I am not recommending that, for the primary reason that the council has never removed a member from his chairmanship without an investigation,” Mendelson said at the March 9 meeting. “To remove a chairmanship based only on allegation will set a precedent that we will not only regret someday, but that disregards due process.”
However, an additional council investigation into Evans’ alleged wrongdoings is unnecessary and would be hindered by the current federal criminal investigation, according to Mendelson.
“First, I believe fundamentally that we must express our disapproval quickly, and an investigation takes time. Second, I believe an investigation would be hindered by the ongoing federal criminal investigation,” Mendelson said. “I don’t believe that our own investigation at this time would be viable.”
Evans will work toward restoring the trust of his constituents, councilmembers and D.C. residents, he said at the hearing.
“I have brought embarrassment to this council, to myself and my family, that being the most painful part of all of this,” Evans said. “Going forward, I will work tirelessly to restore the trust of my constituents, of my colleagues here on this council and of the residents of the District of Columbia.”

Amazon is set to receive $23 million in incentives after a unanimous vote by the Arlington County Board on March 16.
Amazon’s second headquarters will occupy over six million square feet of office space in Northern Virginia through 2035 in exchange for the approved local and state subsidies, according to The Washington Post.
The incentives package is a new model for economic development, according to Arlington County Board Chair Christian Dorsey.
“This performance agreement is really just the beginning of what I believe will be a long and productive partnership between Arlington and Amazon,” Dorsey said in a March 16 news release. “Our vote today reflects our strong belief that Amazon will bring significant benefits to our community, to neighboring Alexandria, the region and the state.”
Crystal City earned one of two winning bids in Amazon’s HQ2 contest in November 2018, with cities from across the nation competing to host the online merchant’s second corporate headquarters. Amazon cancelled its plans for the second headquarters, planned for New York, in February after local leaders opposed providing approximately $3 billion of tax incentives, according to POLITICO.
Supporters of the new headquarters say Amazon’s presence in the region will bring economic benefits, but opponents believe the influx of high-paying jobs and residents could drive up housing prices for current residents. Some residents were opposed to Virginia winning the bidding war, which included 238 cities, because Amazon has a large number of employees in Northern Virginia already, according to Business Insider. Additionally, incentives demanded by the company would come at a cost to taxpayers.
Amazon executives attended the vote and hearing March 16, but their testimony was interrupted by shouts from protestors, eventually forcing them to leave the room, according to The Washington Post. 
Amazon’s expansion into Alexandria and Arlington will result in mass displacement of nearby low-income communities of color in February, according to a Feb. 11 report by the New Virginia Majority, a group that mobilizes minority communities to address economic, social and environmental issues. The company’s high salaries will cause housing prices in the area to increase, pushing out local residents, according to the report.
Local activists, including the group “For Us, Not Amazon,” organized to fight the move and have continued their opposition to the ruling. The group has called for the county board to hold a hearing with Amazon in attendance, but the board did not comment on such a meeting and went ahead with its vote, according to The Washington Post.
The focus should remain on area residents who would be negatively impacted by HQ2, according to Bethany Davis, an organizer of “For Us, Not Amazon.”
“We oppose HQ2 because its arrival will hasten displacement and gentrification already happening,” Davis wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The state and county have made no concrete plans with dedicated funding to prevent this.”
The board’s vote to approve the incentive package was disappointing but not surprising, according to Davis.
“The county board members acknowledged the legitimacy of our concerns and in several places noted where Amazon has failed to meet their own expectations,” Davis wrote. “Nevertheless, they chose to side with corporate class against the people.”
Amazon has engaged in outreach and promised to invest in the local community, according to the Washington Post. Amazon HQ2 is expected to bring roughly 25,000 workers with a $150,000 average annual salary to Crystal City and the surrounding area, according to PC Magazine. 
The majority of  residents in Northern Virginia – 72 percent – supported Amazon HQ2, with businesses, universities and nonprofits especially favoring the deal, according to a December 2018 poll conducted by Christopher Newport University. Schools including Virginia Tech and George Mason University supported the move because Amazon could provide more opportunities for their STEM programs and students, according to The Washington Post.
The NVM report also criticized Amazon’s involvement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Amazon provided ICE with the technology to identify immigrants for deportation, profiting $600,000 a month off this technology, according to MIT Technology Review.
“For Us, Not Amazon” will continue to push for increased transparency from public officials and protection for low-income communities, according to Davis.
“Our concerns do not disappear after the vote,” Davis wrote. “We will continue meeting and organizing to hold the board accountable, demand transparency as the process continues and to work towards protecting the communities most at risk by this decision.”
