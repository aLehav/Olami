After a months-long selection process led by the deans of each Georgetown school, commencement speakers for tomorrow’s undergraduate ceremonies include former Defense Secretary Robert Gates (GRD ’74), former AOL CEO Steve Case, Vatican astronomer Br. Guy Consolmagno, S.J., and American Association for the Advancement of Science CEO Alan Leshner.
Consolmagno will speak at the College commencement ceremony on Healy Lawn at 9 a.m., followed by Leshner at the School of Nursing & Health Studies ceremony at 12 p.m. Gates will address School of Foreign Service graduates at 3 p.m., and Case will speak to McDonough School of Business graduates at 6 p.m.
George Thibault (CAS ’65), president of the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, which works to improve health care in the United States, will address the Georgetown University Medical Center graduating class at 11 a.m. Sunday. Longtime adjunct law professor Kenneth Feinberg, who served as special master for the Federal September 11 Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 and administrator of the BP Deepwater Horizon Disaster Victim Compensation Fund, will be the final commencement speaker at the Georgetown University Law Center ceremony at 2 p.m. Sunday.
All commencement speakers will receive honorary degrees, and none will be paid for their lectures.
Many commencement speakers have past connections with Georgetown. Gates, Thibault and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew (LAW ’83), who addressed McCourt School of Public Policy graduates Thursday, attended the university, and Feinberg taught at the law school from 1978 to 2010 and plans to return in spring 2015.
Consolmagno is a member of the Jesuits’ Maryland Province, which includes Georgetown, and he knows several Jesuits at the university, including Fr. Dave Collins, S.J., and Fr. John Langan, S.J.
Leshner, who will address the NHS, is a long-time associate of NHS Dean Martin Iguchi. Case visited campus in April to participate in Georgetown University Women in Leadership’s Own It Summit as a panelist, and the Case Foundation committed $100,000 to the MSB’s Global Social Enterprise Initiative.
In Georgetown’s traditional vein of seeking commencement speakers, each of this year’s guests’ history and career relates in some way to the specific school he or she will be addressing.
Graduation ceremonies began Thursday with Lew’s McCourt School address, in which he discussed the importance of public service in the face of partisan gridlock.
Dodgers owner Frank McCourt Jr. (CAS ’75), who donated $100 million to found the school in September, attended the ceremony.
“When Americans choose a divided government, they expect us to work out our differences, and that’s where you come in,” Lew told McCourt School graduates. “If any generation can break down those walls, it’s yours.”
Gates, who served as secretary of defense from 2006 to 2011, said he will discuss public service and the importance of international engagement in his speech to SFS graduates.
After earning his doctorate from Georgetown in Russian and Soviet studies “40 years ago this week,” Gates originally planned to pursue a career in academia.
“My plan once I got my Ph.D. was to go out and teach. I had no intention of making CIA or government a career, and literally within a matter of days or weeks of getting my degree, I was invited by [Henry Kissinger and former national security advisor Brent Scowcroft] to take the Soviet job on the National Security Council staff,” Gates said. “I told my wife I’d do that for a couple of years and then I’d go teach, and then they kept offering me interesting jobs and all of a sudden it was decades later.”
As the SFS Class of 2014 graduates, Gates compared foreign service today to when he entered.
“I think that service is more dangerous in more places than it was in 1966. We were at the height of the Cold War and we were at the height of the Vietnam War, but the rest of the world was relatively calm at that time,” Gates said. “I think that whole environment is much more challenging now. I think another aspect that has remained the same, I think unfortunately, is that congressmen don’t understand the importance of our non-military parts of our national security and foreign policy, and so funding for the State Department and [the Agency for International Development] and other such agencies continues to be a struggle.”
In his lecture to College graduates, Consolmagno will talk about the importance of joy and surprise in scholarly endeavors.
“If you don’t have any joy in what you’re doing, if you don’t have any joy in being a scholar, what’s the point of it all?” Consolmagno said via Skype from Rome.
That sense of surprise, he said, relates to his work at the Vatican Observatory, where he curates the Vatican meteorite collection, among other research.
“A lot of people are delighted to know that astronomy, which in one sense seems utterly useless — you’re not going to be rich doing astronomy — and yet it is something everybody’s fascinated by,” Consolmagno said. “I think there’s a deeper message there that it’s important for us as human beings to have things that are more than what’s going to get you a job or put food on the table, but something that feeds your soul.”
Leshner said his address to the NHS will cover what makes a rewarding career, as related to his own experience, which he said has followed a non-linear path.
Case hopes that MSB graduates will capitalize on unique opportunities to make a difference.
“I am confident they will take the skills and knowledge they’ve gained from their time at Georgetown and use it to solve the world’s biggest challenges — and am hopeful that many will choose an entrepreneurial path, as business (and startups in particular) can be an important agent of change,” Case said in a statement.
In his lecture to School of Medicine graduates, Thibault will discuss his father, who was also a doctor, and the changes in medicine that have occurred since he practiced.
“I think the prospects for helping people have never been better,” Thibault said. “A lot has changed in medicine, but that represents a lot of opportunity for the next generation to participate in medicine, to make the health care system even better and continue to make improvements not only in the science of medicine, but also how we go about delivering better care more efficiently.”
At the Law Center, Feinberg will honor the school’s former dean, Robert Pitofsky, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission who brought Feinberg to Georgetown in 1978 and will be in attendance Sunday.
“I’ll be talking about the communitarian ethic, the idea that public service is a noble calling and that serving the public interest is very important, that every individual can make a difference in their own way and that we have to get over this polarization that now grips the country and prevents progress,” Feinberg said.
When the university released its lineup of commencement speakers May 1, student reaction varied, with some students expressing disappointment with the choices through social media and elsewhere. Beth Anne Kadien (COL ’14) was one of a few students to respond to these complaints with her own post.
“I saw not a ton, five or six statuses, being like, ‘Oh cool I get an astronomer who, cares about that,’ being sarcastic and whiny about it,” Kadien said. “It made me write my Facebook post because people were being ungrateful and not seeing the bigger picture, not looking into what the speaker has done. I think the general consensus was people need to stop complaining and this could be a really cool thing.”
Other commencement speakers include Seyla Benhabib, the Eugene Meyer professor of political science and philosophy at Yale University, for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences ceremony; Roger Ferguson, CEO of financial service company TIAA-CREF, for MBA graduates; and University of Pennsylvania School of Design Dean Marilyn Jordan Taylor at the School of Continuing Studies.

Each year, a few hundred students venture into the mountains to reflect, bond and sing songs as part of the ESCAPE retreat. After nine years at Georgetown, the man largely responsible for shaping the retreat into its current success, Fr. Patrick Rogers, S.J., will depart to enter the tertianship program of the Society of Jesus.
Tertainship, a period of reflection, is the last step before a Jesuit takes his final vows.
“I’ve been called to finish my formation as a Jesuit priest. … Every Jesuit has to do it and you do it post-ordination,” Rogers, the current director of Catholic chaplaincy, said. “And I’ve been talking about this with my superiors and for various reasons we decided that it would be the time now to finish the process. I knew this was coming years ago, in some sense, but it was finalized back in December.”
Having entered the Society of Jesus 22 years ago, Rogers, 50, a professional musician by trade and education, was ordained in 2002. He worked in a parish and at Xavier High School in New York City before coming to Georgetown, his longest assignment.
He was originally hired to work with the ESCAPE program and conduct part-time ministry on the medical campus. Within six months, Rogers was asked to assume the position of director of Campus Ministry on the main campus, with the aim of reorganizing the department.
“When I first got here, there was just a lot of confusion in our own department … about who reports to whom, what’s our budget,” Rogers said. “I think what I’m proudest of is the fact that we have a really professional department.”
Under his leadership, Campus Ministry strengthened its integration with the rest of the university by engaging with a broader tapestry of departments, particularly the McDonough School of Business. Rogers worked with MSB deans on immersion programs that entailed working with poor businesses in Latin America.
The priest held the position of director for seven years, before the appointment of Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J. (C ’88) as vice president for mission and ministry allowed for a reimagination of the department, including the creation of a Campus Ministry managing director position. Rogers subsequently stepped down as director in order to concentrate on his coursework for a doctorate of liberal studies, which he recently completed. He will work on his doctoral thesis after tertianship.
O’Brien and Rogers have known each other for 18 years, when the former joined the Jesuits.
“Pat joined the Jesuits before I did, so in a sense, I looked up to him,” O’Brien said. “Pat is a pastor above all. He has a very engaging dynamic and welcoming personality. He is well-known among students, faculty and staff and well loved. He will be greatly missed because of his always friendly and uplifting presence.”
O’Brien described Rogers’ commitment to the ESCAPE program, which was echoed by Imam Yahya Hendi, the director of Muslim chaplaincy.
“I don’t know if we can understand the ESCAPE retreat very well without him. The ESCAPE retreat has become very known, very outreaching because of him. He has been able to help the retreat engage more [non-Catholics] than before,” Hendi said.
Rogers supervised former ESCAPE director Bridget Sherry for over three years.
“He’s a wonderful musician. … We do a lot of singing on ESCAPE and that’s a real gift of Fr. Pat’s. He really has a lot of exuberance and love of life that really comes through,” she said. Rogers extended this love of music to the larger campus community, with “Jammin’ Jesuit Java” nights.
Rogers also founded the LGBTQ Catholic Prayer Group, which predates the establishment of the LGBTQ Resource Center.
“The students that I’ve had the chance to work with in this group have changed and strengthened my faith in so many ways. Many of them live in the painful tension between their sexuality and their faith,” Rogers wrote in an email. “I always sought to deepen the students’ faith through the lens of Ignatian principles and to help them navigate that tricky road of faith that every person must walk regardless of one’s sexual orientation. The robust faith of these students continues to humble me.”
Sherry currently serves as special projects coordinator at the LGBTQ Resource Center and has borne witness to the prayer group’s effect on students.
“Fr. Pat is someone who has been an ally and caretaker for students. I think he’s brought a lot of joy,” she said. “I think Fr. Pat’s prayer group is a really real way that Georgetown and Campus Ministry can show there’s a real place for these students and that they don’t have to turn away from their faith because of who they are. … And I think that’s really healing in immeasurable ways.”
Another focus of Campus Ministry during Rogers’ time in the department has been interfaith collaboration, with programming featuring members of the Jewish, Muslim, Orthodox, Protestant and Catholic chaplaincies.
“The fact that he comes to Friday service and sits on the floor and prays with Muslims, that opened so many doors between him and the Muslim students. That made it easier for him to engage and be engaged,” Hendi said.
Hendi and Rogers led an interfaith trip to the Middle East to explore the Holy Land. The imam described the priest as the ideal travelling partner, pointing to his humility, honesty and humor, a reflection agreed upon by many of Rogers’ associates.
“I met Fr. Pat when he first arrived on campus. I remember seeing this imposing figure with a smile that welcomed everyone,” Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Jeanne Lord wrote in an email. “Fr. Pat has a generous heart, that’s matched by his wisdom and kindness. He’s one of the first people we turn to when there’s a student in need, and we can always count on him.”
Rogers’ last day at the university is June 10 and he will leave for Portland, Ore., in August to embark on tertianship, which lasts between six months and one year. During this time, the Jesuit undertakes direct ministry with the poor, a silent retreat and study of the society’s founding documents, fostering a deeper connection to the order. The stages of a Jesuit formation are directed by the Jesuit’s provincial.
“Typically, five to 10 years after theology, men do enter tertianship,” Maryland Province Communications Associate Sheila Welton said. “I do think there is a kind of typical process, and it’s mutual. It’s designed so that it is an individual experience. … [The decision] is mutual between the Jesuit and the provincial through conversations and prayers.”
After tertianship, Rogers will complete his doctoral thesis from Georgetown, but his future destination remains uncertain at this point. He expressed a deep admiration and adoration of the Georgetown community and his time here, which was slightly atypical in its length.
“Usually you would do this four to five years after ordination,” Rogers said of tertianship. “At one point I just kept my head down, hoping they’d forget.”

Graduation ceremonies for the Class of 2014 kicked off as graduating seniors presented a class gift of $155,640.40 to the university during the convocation ceremony Thursday afternoon.
This record gift included both funds raised by the Class of 2014 and a percentage-match donation of $73,000 from the Board of Regents, which donated $1,000 for each percentage point of seniors that gave.
The Class of 2014 exceeded the Class of 2013’s $147,004.54 gift in both size and participation rate. Seventy-one percent of seniors contributed to their class gift last year, while a record 73 percent of graduates donated this year.
Senior Class Fund Co-Chairs Elizabeth Abello (COL ’14) and Peter Brigham (SFS ’14) presented the check to University President John J. DeGioia. “The [Regents’] Challenge has magnified the impact of senior class giving over the past several years and we’re grateful that they decided to do it again this year,” Brigham said.
While past years have focused on the percentage of the senior class that donated to the Class Fund, special emphasis was placed on breaking the record for the number of individual student donors this year.
“We decided to structure [the fundraising] a little bit differently this year. For the Regents’ Challenge this year, when we hit a given numbers of donors, we would unlock a gift from the Board of Regents,” Abello said. “We’re more interested in creating relationships between individuals and the university. We’re more concerned with the number of unique donors.” 1,249 seniors ended up contributing to this year’s class gift.
Marketing for donations to the senior gift this year focused largely on the impact that the donations would have for Georgetown’s posterity.
“This year, we’ve really focused on using every tool that we can — from social media to a presence on campus — to reinforce to seniors the impact of giving back to Georgetown and the importance of building our philanthropic legacy as a senior class,” Brigham said.
In recent years, the senior gift changed to a cash donation from physical landmarks around campus.
“When a senior class donates a bench or a tree, that’s it. You’ve given a gift, it’s a one-time thing, and you’re done,” Abello said.
Under the cash donation system, seniors can donate to any academic department, student organization, athletic team or other group of their choice. The $73,000 donated by the Board of Regents will go to the 1789 Scholarship Fund.
The convocation ceremony, held in McDonough Arena, also featured an address by Steve Silvius (COL ’07), co-founder and chief education officer of an education technology startup called Three Ring. His speech focused on forging unique paths and never shying away from a challenge.
“Seven years ago, I sat exactly where you are sitting,” Silvius said. “I was feeling good, like pop-your-collar kind of good, and I hope you’re feeling that way today.”
The presentation of the senior class gift followed the convocation address, after which Alumni Association President Mary Beth Connell (MED ’89) led seniors in affixing class pins to their graduation robes to represent the Class of 2014’s official induction into the Georgetown alumni network.
Tropaia ceremonies for the four undergraduate schools will occur Friday in Gaston Hall, during which awards will be presented to honor the achievements of students, faculty and staff. The valedictorians from the College and the McDonough School of Business will speak at their respective ceremonies. The School of Nursing and Health Studies and the School of Foreign Service do not have valedictorians.
The Senior Ball, which will be held Friday evening at Union Station, will conclude Senior Week, a period of festivities organized by the Senior Class Committee. Other events from the week included a class barbecue, a toga party, a field day on Kehoe Field, a keg party on Regents Lawn and the President’s Picnic at Smokey Glen Farm in Maryland.
“The President’s Picnic is the biggest, and I think most of our favorite, event,” Senior Class Committee Chair Cody Cowan (SFS ’14) said. “It’s nice to just get away, and to have all of us together.”
According to Cowan, planning for Senior Week has been underway since Disorientation 2.0 ended in January, with special attention devoted to alcohol-related events.
“The keg parties always have the biggest potential for disaster, just because they have alcohol, are giant and there are always worries about noise,” Cowan said.
After a fire alarm disrupted last year’s senior keg party in O’Donovan Dining Hall, this year’s two major parties have been moved from McDonough parking lot and O’Donovan Hall to the Leavey Esplanade and Regents Lawn.
For many seniors, the Senior Week festivities serve as a transitional period between life as students and life as college graduates.
“It’s the week between finals and graduation, so it’s a celebration of being done, but also a time to get together and both reflect and celebrate,” Cowan said. “It’s not just partying, there’s a lot of prepping for life after graduation.”
Undergraduate commencement ceremonies will be held Saturday. According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, 1,429 seniors have applied to graduate. This number includes students graduating from the School of Continuing Studies and the School of Foreign Service campus in Qatar, which held its commencement ceremony last Sunday.

As the academic year comes to a close, the university is preparing to advance several campus construction projects this summer, some of which will have noticeable impacts on the campus community come fall.
Preliminary work is scheduled to begin this summer for the construction of both the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall and the John R. Thompson Jr. Intercollegiate Athletic Center, as well as the conversion of Ryan and Mulledy Halls into student residences.
Construction on the Healey Family Student Center began last August and will enter its final stages this summer, with a completion date set for the beginning of the fall semester.
Currently, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems are being installed, electrical work has begun and live wall construction has commenced. Later in the summer, hard interior finishes — such as floors, restroom fixtures and furniture — will be installed.
“By and large, a lot of the heavy demolition and some of the new construction work is finished. They’re starting to do interior finishes right now and we’re on schedule to open up in August,” Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said.
Preliminary stages of the conversion of Ryan and Mulledy Halls, the former Jesuit residence, into a student residence will begin May 19. The housing materials abatement and demolition stages of construction will be completed this summer.
“There’s lead paint and asbestos in those buildings, so we have to go in there and properly abate those according to [Environmental Protection Agency] standards, and then the demolition of walls that we’re not going to use as part of the design, old utilities systems that we’re not going to use,” Morey said. “That’s just really demolition. There’s nothing exciting about that work other than that’s what you need to do in order to get the new stuff in there.”
After these regulatory processes are completed this summer, exterior construction will commence in the fall. The conversion of the residence, which will house 160 students, is scheduled to be complete by fall 2015.
The university received Old Georgetown Board concept approval for the Northeast Triangle in March and will go before the OGB for design development approval in June. If the university receives OGB approval, it will begin site utility relocation later that month, Senior University Architect Jodi Ernst said in an interview with The Hoya last month.
“The site had all of the existing utilities running underneath the footprint, so we need to relocate them underneath the new walkway, which means putting in new pipes and switching over the electrical and the sewer and the plumbing. … That’s about a four-month project,” Ernst said.
Morey said that he hopes to break ground for the Northeast Triangle in August. The residence hall is scheduled to open in fall 2016.
In order to accommodate the construction of the Northeast Triangle, which will be located south of Henle Village, pedestrian traffic will be rerouted to the east side of Reiss Science Building beginning in the fall semester. Morey said that he does not anticipate that this change will have a major impact on pedestrian traffic.
“It’s one of our most [used] pedestrian paths, but the width of the path is no different than the width of [the detour] on the east side [of Reiss]. It’s a minor inconvenience at best,” Morey said.
Although this walkway is among the most popular pedestrian paths on campus, some students agree that the detour will not pose a major inconvenience for them.
“I think that it will be slightly inconvenient, but I don’t think that it will add any more than one or two minutes to wherever you’re going,” Marla Abadilla (MSB ’17), who will be living in Henle Village next semester, said.
The construction of the Intercollegiate Athletic Center will also impact pedestrian traffic. Due to changes in the routes of the Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle buses, pedestrian traffic will be rerouted to the sidewalks closer to Wolfington Hall and the Southwest Quad, instead of going by the tennis courts, which will be removed during the construction of the IAC.
The construction of the IAC, which is expected to take about two years, will follow a similar schedule as that of the Northeast Triangle.
“We’re doing it in two phases. The first phase would be breaking ground and doing the site work and the excavation, and then the second one would be when you see it coming out of the ground,” Morey said. “We anticipate to start that in the summer, when we get board approval and all the permits.”

Sure, Georgetown needs to promote underage drinking ON-campus and the revenues need to go back to the school (or an entity paying the school rent)… I mean, why have a pub on-campus at the Healey “Family” Student Center when the vast majority of the student body is UNDER the legal drinking age?  Hypocritical of our school’s values or small interest-pork barreling–which is worse, I don’t know.

Georgetown saw a slight decline in its admissions yield this year, with 46 percent of students accepted to the Class of 2018 enrolling at Georgetown compared to last year’s rate of 47.4 percent.
Of the 3,232 students admitted to Georgetown this year, 1,525 chose to enroll and submitted deposits by the May 1 deadline, according to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon.
In spite of the slight decrease, Deacon highlighted the consistency of the yield and cited the figure as an improvement in comparison to the rate during the recession.
“Our yield has ranged from 43 to 49 or 50 percent over the last 15 to 20 years,” Deacon said. “We were down around 43 percent the year after the recession when financial matters were a big deal and it’s been moving back upward since then.”
The Class of 2018 has a record number of students from California, and no students from South Dakota, although four students from the state were accepted.
As of fall 2014, the Class of 2018 will be the only class at Georgetown without representation from all 50 states. The graduating Class of 2014 also only enrolled students from 49 states, missing North Dakota.
Deacon said that geographical diversity remains a priority for Georgetown, and that the university is pursuing a student from South Dakota who is currently on the waitlist.
“It’s great to be able to say we have students from all 50 states,” he said.
Shilpa Chandran (MSB ’15), who is from Sioux Falls, S.D., noted the lack of South Dakotan presence at Georgetown, attributing it largely to geography.
“The majority of students from my high school actually went to schools in the Midwest. … A lot of students just don’t go that far,” she said. “It seems like the majority of students [at Georgetown] come from either coast.”
Chandran also pointed to the lack of available information about Georgetown as a factor that contributes to the deficit of students from less common areas of the country.
“Most students perceive those schools to be so far away geographically and culturally that they feel more comfortable applying to schools within the Midwest,” she said. “There’s just a lack of information on what these schools actually are and what they could offer students from the Midwest.”
Justin Chapman (MSB ’15), president of Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program, agreed.
“The best way for us to get a wide range of students at Georgetown is to make [the school] known throughout their area, so we have winter receptions, high school visits over winter break or Thanksgiving break so that people from all areas of the country can learn more about Georgetown,” Chapman said. Although California has provided the highest number of applicants of any state for a number of years, this year represents the first time that enrolled Californians have outnumbered students from any other state.
Deacon attributed this increase to Georgetown’s nationwide cachet and shrinkage in the applicant pool from the Northeast.
“We’re lucky, being a national university and located in D.C., we continue to see that national appeal. If you are simply located in the northeast and your pool was from New York or New Jersey, you’d be quite worried because that pool is going down quite rapidly and you can’t offset it by people coming from California,” Deacon said.
Jordan Neman (MSB ’16), from Beverly Hills, Calif., attributed the high number of Californians at Georgetown to a lack of options at home.
“If you think about California itself, especially southern California, you’re choosing between the [University of California campuses] and [the University of Southern California] and Stanford. It’s just limited,” he said. “It seems like every school besides those is on the east coast.”
The 1,525 enrolled students who are currently enrolled represent a deficit of 55 below the enrollment cap of 1,580 put in place by the 2010 Campus Plan agreement. In meeting this target enrollment, Deacon stressed the importance of careful planning and utilization of the wait list.
“Under no condition can we go over and the only way we can avoid that is by artificially lowering the number we admit. Our enrollment plan always includes enrolling 70, 80, 90 [students] from the waiting list,” he said.
The university has initially admitted 60 students off the waitlist to fill out the Class of 2018 and 190 students remain, according to Deacon. Deacon expects to be able to offer spots to a total of 75 to 100 students from the waitlist.
The McDonough School of Business had the highest yield rate of the four undergraduate schools at about 57 percent, followed by the School of Nursing and Health Studies at 49 percent, the School of Foreign Service at 47 percent and the College at 42 percent.
Deacon attributed the higher yield rate for the MSB to the current economic climate.
“There are people who would have been in the College or School of Foreign Service who are in the business school now because they still see this liberal arts-based program, but they also see that [the MSB] has that degree that they think will give them some leverage,” he said.
This year, Georgetown looks to accept about 140 transfer students, compared to 170 to 220 in past years, Deacon said. Decision letters to transfer students will be sent June 1.
Overall, Deacon expressed optimism for the Class of 2018.
“I think it’s going to be a great class,” he said. “People seem to be really enthusiastic about coming and they come from even more diversity overall than they have been because the country continues to shift little by little.

As if “being limited” to UCs, USC, and Stanford is bad. What a stupid comment.

Peter says 
May 16, 2014 at 7:17 pm
As if someone admitted to Stanford would choose Georgetown…

TSC says 
May 17, 2014 at 10:59 am
Actually, many students choose Georgetown over Stanford, including me.

Bill says 
May 21, 2014 at 8:56 am
Stop it. I can’t believe many, if any, would make that decision. Does GU think that alums really care about having kids from all 50 states too?

Alex says 
May 21, 2014 at 5:06 pm
Yes, most students admitted to Stanford will choose it over Georgetown, but plenty do pick Georgetown over HYPS, especially for specific programs like the SFS or MSB, since Stanford and the Ivies either don’t have comparable programs or don’t have the geographic networking and internship advantages of being in Washington. Georgetown isn’t exactly known for its computer science programs, and I would certainly advise someone to go to Stanford if they wanted to work for a tech startup, but if your interests are in government or anything related to it, Georgetown is definitely the way to go.
I really don’t see the point of trying to make sure we can slap “With all 50 states represented in our student body, we are a diverse campus with many backgrounds!” on an admissions pamphlet. It certainly shouldn’t determine which of two similar students we decide to admit for the 1580th spot in the class.

Bill King says 
May 22, 2014 at 1:43 pm
Alex, I agree that SFS is unique but MSB is not in the same category as evidenced by the lastes Bloomberg/Businessweek rankings (#18). I would think that attending Stanford and studying econ would be a better decision than finance at MSB, for instance. I think our admissions dept is out of touch with what our campus and alums care about.

Peter says 
May 22, 2014 at 6:03 pm
TSC, you are a dyed in the wool contrarian for having chosen Georgetown. Stanford’s yield rate was 78.9%  this year versus 46% for Georgetown. Stanford has the lowest admit rate of any top mainstream university in the country at 5.07%. That’s lower than Harvard for the second straight year. Georgetown’s admit rate was 16.6%- like Stanford (maybe) in the mid 1970s in a really, really off year. Top law and business and med schools are chock full of Stanford grads every year, while Georgetown with similar class size barely cracks the top 20- if that.  No one in Cambridge, MA writes forlorn articles about “Gee, life would be so great if I would have just gone to/gotten into Georgetown.” Meanwhile, articles in The Crimson about  what life would be like at Stanford are now an annual ritual. Go check for yourself. The Academic Ranking of Global Universities ranks Stanford as #2 behind Harvard. Georgetown is ranked between 301-400 (!!!). That all said, I know of one clown who turned down Stanford for a free ride at Pitt. So you’re not alone. But at least Pitt was ranked #61.

This year’s five valedictorians and dean’s medal recipients, with a tie in the College, will be honored this weekend for their GPAs — four 4.0s and one 3.97.
Jenny Hammer (COL ’14) and Blair Vorsatz (COL ’14), both with 4.0s, are valedictorians of the College, and will speak at the College’s Tropaia ceremony Friday. Michael J. Lee (MSB ’14), who earned a 3.97, will give the valedictory address at the McDonough School of Business Tropaia ceremony on Friday.
The School of Nursing and Health Studies and the School of Foreign Service do not appoint valedictorians, but Caroline Cotto (NHS ’14) and Michael Reher (SFS ’14) are awarded their respective school’s dean’s medal for their respective 4.0 GPAs. They will not speak at their schools’ Tropaia ceremonies.
Each honored student will carry his or her school’s banner at commencement Saturday, leading the processional.
Hammer majored in psychology with minors in business administration and art history. She said that becoming valedictorian was never a goal that she set for herself but that self-motivation earned her that honor.
“I always just wanted to do the best that I could. I always put my best into everything that I do, and I think that persistence drove my focus throughout college,” Hammer wrote in an email.
Hammer will work at a consulting firm in New York City after graduating, and plans to pursue an MBA or a law degree in the future. Her speech Friday will focus on opportunity and persistence.
“I’m going to talk about how uncertainty is an opportunity, how it’s important to maintain composure in the face of a door that has closed, because the next open door might be right around the corner,” Hammer wrote.
Vorsatz double-majored in Chinese and economics and will pursue a master’s degree in regional East Asian studies at Harvard after graduation.
“I’m torn between economics and international relations, and the graduate program is really flexible so I can kind of test out both and find out what I want to do after that, probably [pursue] either another master’s or a Ph.D. in one of the two fields,” Vorsatz said.
Vorsatz, who served as the captain of the Georgetown Boxing Club for two-and-a-half years, said that his involvement with the team influenced his academic success.
“With all of the hard work that you put into boxing, you’re going to be able to persevere and work through adversity. That work ethic really goes over into the classroom,” he said. He plans to talk about perseverance and hard work in his address.
Lee, a finance major, completed his course of study in the MSB in December and is currently working as an investment banking analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York City.
“It’s a lot of fun. I’m very tired, but I have no complaints and I’m glad that I did it,” Lee said.
For Lee, having a successful career after graduation was a motivating factor in his academic life.
“When I went to college, I realized that if I wanted to have the career that I wanted, then ultimately I’d have to have the right background, so I decided to work really hard,” he said. “Something that I believe in is that there are a lot of things in life that you can’t control, but there are some things that you can, and one of those things is how hard you work.”
Cotto, a human science major, said that she did not set out to be valedictorian, but rather aimed to explore her academic interests and take classes that were appealing to her.
“I don’t feel like I took classes with the goal of trying to get valedictorian of the NHS. I took classes that really interested me and that I was passionate about and that ended up translating into good grades because I was interested in the work I was doing,” Cotto said.
Cotto, who studied abroad in Shanghai last spring, will spend a year in Taiwan teaching English to elementary or middle school students through the Fulbright U.S. Student Program following graduation.
She was two courses short of completing a pre-medical track, but decided instead to take classes that seemed more interesting to her.
“I’m very much a type A planner. I think that much of my success in high school and college has come from the fact that I manage my time very well and prioritize,” Cotto said. “But when it comes to my life, I haven’t really planned beyond this year. I’m trying to be OK with that and just sort of see where it takes me.”
Reher, an international economics major, said that earning the SFS Dean’s Medal was a goal that he set for himself during his freshman year.
“As a freshman, I kind of had a vague sort of desire to achieve something like this, so it was somewhere in the back of my mind,” Reher said.
He will pursue a Ph.D. in economics at Harvard following graduation and hopes to eventually have a career either in academia or with the Federal Reserve System.
Reher ran middle distance on Georgetown’s varsity track and field team and said that the skills that he developed on this team contributed to his academic success.
“There’s difficulties in terms of logistics sometimes, in terms of travelling for meets and having to reschedule exams and homework, but I think on the whole it keeps me very regimented and organized,” Reher said. “I cultivated a drive to succeed that I can bring to other areas of life.”

At age 21, Rashawn Davis (COL ’14) was the youngest candidate in the race for the West Ward of Newark City Council on Tuesday, joining seven other candidates vying for two-term Councilman Ron Rice’s spot.
On Election Day, May 13, Davis earned 5.87 percent of the vote with 37 out of 39 precincts counted, placing him sixth out of the eight total candidates.
Since no one candidate won over 50 percent of the vote, Patricia Bradford and Joseph McCallum, who won 21.25 percent and 25.84 of the vote respectively will meet in a run-off election June 10.
Davis said that he was initially motivated to run by a desire to help, citing his hometown’s $90 million deficit and laying off 150 uniformed police officers, but was surprised to see his campaign grow at the rate that it did.
“I think initially when we started this, I wanted just to be sort of a voice to add to the conversation. I don’t think we necessarily knew it would grow into this,” Davis said.
Born and raised in Newark, N.J., in 2009 Davis was accepted into the New Jersey Scholars, a competitive, free summer program for rising high-school seniors in the state, making him the only African-American student in his class of scholars and the first student from Newark public schools to be accepted in decades. He also served on the Newark Youth Council and volunteered on President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign.
At Georgetown, Davis majored in government with a concentration in justice and peace studies and served as the vice president of the university’s NAACP chapter.
Before the election, Davis said that his young age could be an asset toward his campaign because it would better allow him to bring a new perspective to a city council containing members who have been in place for over a decade.
“If you look at our leadership, a lot of people who are leading have been leading for 20, 30 years … so we need a new generation of leaders,” Davis said. “I think the reality is that with the millennial generation, there comes a sense of innovation and a sense of new and fresh ideas.”
However, with youth also came a lack of experience, name recognition and funding.
“We just don’t have as many of the networks as someone who is 40 or 50 years old, so I think what you have to do is sort of be innovative in how we kind of circumvent those problems,” Davis said.
Georgetown government professor Hans Noel agreed.
“Politics is about alliances and being in the right faction and connecting people, and having a support team and so forth, and you take time to build that, and it’s hard to build that when you’re also getting an education three hours away,” Noel said.
Davis added that his young age allowed him to make better use of social media, a tool he relied heavily upon to spread information about his campaign.
“A lot of other candidates didn’t know how to use social media like that,” Davis said.
Running on a platform of fresh change for Newark, Davis proposed starting a mentoring program, creating more block associations to encourage neighbors to join together, and launching a “city hall on wheels” initiative, an idea borrowed from Boston in which city hall officials would drive to different neighborhoods in a truck, thus promoting increased communication between city hall officials and Newark residents.
According to Noel, Davis’ loss should not be attributed to his age, but rather to his position as a challenger to the long-standing social structure in Newark city politics.
“It takes time to break in to shake things up and that, more than age, is the challenge,” Noel said.
Davis experienced this opposition to change and innovation firsthand, notably through the vandalization of his property and the property of his staff.
“People tearing down your signs, and vandalizing some of your property. … You just kind of got to learn … that’s what happens when you try to make serious change,” Davis said.
Noel compared Davis to former Newark councilman and mayor and current New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, a young, energetic politician known for positively using social media and introducing changes to the city.
“I think there are a lot of parallels between the Cory Booker story and the Davis story in that he too wants to make some changes … and that’s a hard thing to do, to come from the outside and try to make changes, for anyone,” Noel said.
Julie Hutchinson, a student in Georgetown’s Semester in Washington program who worked in Newark City Hall with a prisoner re-entry program, said that she thought Cory Booker’s term as mayor has paved the way for more young people to enter politics.
“I think it’s really special to see young people want to invest in the future of Newark again, and I think that that in large part was due to the way Cory Booker ran Newark,” Hutchinson said.
She added that, even though Davis lost the election, it has benefitted his political career to increase his name recognition.
“For Rashawn Davis to run, in a lot of ways, is going to be incredibly important even though he didn’t win, because I think it’s going to show that there is just a lot of incredibly competent people coming out of Newark who are just really proud to be from the city,” Hutchinson said.
After graduation, Davis plans to work at the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey before attempting to run again for city council in 2018.
Public policy professor William Gormley, whom Davis cited as one of his favorite professors, has high hopes for Davis’ future political career.
“I think that Rashawn has a great future in politics if he persists. … A lot of very famous politician have lost big races early in their careers: Barack Obama, Jeb Bush, Bill Clinton — they bounced back and I think Rashawn can too,” Gormley said.
Tuesday also saw Ras Baraka, a strong critic of Booker, elected mayor of Newark in a race against Shavar Jeffries.
Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Rashawn Davis was accepted to the Harvard Kennedy School.  He was accepted to a program at the Kennedy School, not to the school.

Executive MBA student Justin Gandino-Saadein (GRD ’15) announced his candidacy for the House of Representatives, representing Virginia’s third congressional district, on May 5.
Gandino-Saadein is running as an Independent against incumbent Bobby Scott (D-Va.), who has occupied the seat since 1993. Scott has carried the district with over 70 percent of the vote since 1992, even taking 98 percent of the vote in 2000. The third district, which spans from Norfolk to Richmond, is Virginia’s most Democratic district.
“We have a congressman who’s a nice guy, and he’s been there for 22 years, but he’s not a leader,” Gandino-Saadein said. “We have to have a leader. … I think he’s comfortable in his position, and he’s not aggressively fighting for what he needs to in the District — jobs, better wages.”
Shawn Williamson, Scott’s press contact, said that Scott is withholding comment until after all candidates are officially certified from the Democratic primary June 10 and the Republican convention May 3.
“I hope people embrace the need for leadership and are willing to step away from the status quo and only vote for one party,” Gandino-Saadein said. “We need to embrace open-mindedness.”
Gandino-Saadein stressed the importance of independent candidates and voters in today’s heavily partisan political environment.
“I’m not against large parties, but the two parties are not talking right now,” Gandino-Saadein said. “When you talk with someone, and you say you’re from a party, there’s a 50-50 chance that person will shut down because everything is so polarized right now.”
Gandino-Saadein, who served for over 10 years in the Armed Forces, cited his previous military background as a testament to his leadership abilities. Gandino-Saadein said he believed that his negotiation skills, in particular, would help address the current gridlock in Congress.
“My military service and that negotiation ability and leadership will allow me to bridge the gap and open the gateways of communication between the two parties,” Gandino-Saadein said.
Gandino-Saadein’s platform focuses on raising the standard of living, primarily by increasing the minimum wage and ensuring that military veterans have access to vital services.
According to Gandino-Saadein, the minimum wage has not kept pace with the cost of living over the last few decades, which has reduced the standard of living for working-class families. As a result, he wants to raise the minimum wage from $7.24 an hour to $16.
While Scott and Gandino-Saadein agree on raising the minimum wage, however, Gandino-Saadein criticized Scott’s lack of explanation for how he would make the hike profitable for businesses. Gandino-Saadein, who founded a digital media firm in 2013, stressed the importance of supporting small businesses.
“What are you doing for the businesses? You’ve got to offset that with tax incentives, allow these businesses to circulate that through their employees and through the community,” Gandino-Saadein said. “That combined with the health care law is putting a lot of pressure on business, and I’m not sure we’re setting them up to succeed.”
Furthermore, as a veteran, Gandino-Saadein said that ensuring vital services for veterans is one of his top legislative priorities.
“It is absolutely deplorable that we are even in discussion of cutting military benefits when we are still at war,” Gandino-Saadein said. “There are no words. … There is waste in our government, but our waste is not with our service members, and they should receive the benefits they were promised.”
According to Georgetown Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, while the university does not endorse any candidates because of its tax-exempt status, the university is proud that so many alumni engage in public service.
Currently, Gandino-Saadein is still collecting signatures from District voters for his candidate petition; the minimum number is 1,000. Overall, he said he was happy with the state of his campaign and the support that he has received.
“I didn’t expect the overwhelming support that I have been receiving. … I wish there was more constructive criticism,” Gandino-Saadein said. “Money is [a challenge] because I know Congressman Scott has quite the war chest, but I have confidence in our ability to run a grassroots campaign.”

On April 22, the Supreme Court ruled to uphold Michigan’s 2006 decision — which was supported by 58 percent of voters — to ban consideration of race or sex in public education and employment, a victory for states’ rights.
In a 6-2 vote, the justices ruled in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action that a lower court did not have the power to overrule Michigan’s affirmative action ban, upholding Michigan’s ruling that colleges may not give “preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin.”
The foundation of the Michigan case rested on the assertion that affirmative action is discrimination against white people and thus a violation of the 14th Amendment.
Since the 14th Amendment applies only to state laws, private universities like Georgetown are exempt from any legal basis that threatens affirmative action in admissions. Georgetown Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon identified a clear correlation between the prohibition of affirmative action and a reduction in diversity.
“I think the evidence is very clear. In the states that have adopted these policies, the number of African-American and Latino students enrolled in state universities has shrunk significantly,” Deacon said.
McCourt School of Public Policy professor Harry Holzer explained that the ruling focused more on whether or not a popular referendum has the power to make those kinds of decisions, rather than on the fairness of affirmative action as a practice.
“This ruling was not about whether affirmative action at the University of Michigan should be allowed to exist,” he said. “The issue was whether a popular referendum is allowed to ban affirmative action.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor publicly spoke out against the decision as a step back for equal rights in a 58-page dissent.
“Today’s decision eviscerates an important strand of our equal protection jurisprudence,” Sotomayor wrote in a dissent.
Ada Meloy, General Counsel for the American Council of Education, also disagreed with the decision. The ACE submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court stressing their hope that the Supreme Court would respect its 2009 decision in University of Texas v. Fisher, which maintained that the University of Texas had the right to consider race in its admissions process.
“We were pleased that the court did not take away that ability of institutions, but disappointed that it allowed the ban to survive in Michigan,” Meloy said.
Holzer expressed concern over the decision, as it relates to the future of affirmative action as well as the power of popular referendum to make decisions.
“You know you could make a case that it’s important to respect the popular majorities, but if you had done that in the South, you never would have gotten rid of Jim Crow laws and all that,” Holzer said.
Deacon agreed that the future of affirmative action in public universities is beginning to look grim.
“You could say it has a chilling effect on the idea of affirmative action overall,” Deacon said.
Now that eight states including Michigan have placed restraints on affirmative action in public higher education admissions, state universities will begin to look at other ways to create a more diverse student body other than looking at race.
Holzer, who supports affirmative action as a policy in higher education, addressed the psychology behind the voters’ call.
“A lot of middle-income white people think that — they know that minority kids can get in with lower grades and lower test scores, and that makes them really angry. They feel that they’re the victims of discrimination. It’s sort of a narrow view,” Holzer said.
As schools now barred from consideration of race in admissions must alter their methods to include more socioeconomic diversity, Deacon said that Georgetown’s admission process has also begun to change to focus more on leveling the playing field for students who had access to fewer resources but does not neglect lower-income white students, a demographic that is left out from affirmative action.
“The way we think about affirmative action began to shift back in the [2004-2006] period, especially when we began starting to expand what I consider our affirmative action, to socio-economic as opposed to race … how do we think about putting the thumb on the scale to level the playing field as best we can for everyone,” Deacon said. “It has an ability to respond in a wider way but it also doesn’t leave people behind.”

The percentage of students choosing to enroll in college from high school has steadily declined since the end of the recession in 2009, sparking concerns about demographic changes in the national student population.
On April 22, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a report on college enrollment that found that the proportion of students from the high school class of 2013 was lower than the previous year, continuing a trend of decline from a 2009 peak.
According to the press release from the BLS, 65.9 percent of 2013 high school graduates were enrolled in colleges or universities in October 2013.
That number was down from 66.2 percent in 2012, and showed a significant decline from the all-time peak of 70.1 percent in 2009.
The recovery from the financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 is one of the primary driving forces behind this recent shift of choosing employment over college, according to Nora Gordon, associate professor of public policy at the McCourt School of Public Policy.
“If it’s a recession, and if you’re not enrolled, you’d be unemployed, so the opportunity cost of your time has gone down, and your likelihood of enrolling has gone up,” Gordon said. “That explains why you would really see, in an economic recovery, the likelihood of finding employment with just your high school diploma is going up, so the opportunity cost of your time has gone down.”
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said it would be unlikely, however, that most applicants to Georgetown would be faced with a decision between university enrollment and employment. Although Georgetown saw a 2.6 percent drop in applications and a 1.4 percent decline in yield rate for the Class of 2018, the applicant pool has remained relatively consistent.
“I think what this [statistic] would reflect is the bottom of the applicant pool, affecting people who are maybe in a more difficult financial decision, wondering whether they might have difficulty affording the cost of college if they have an opportunity for a job,” Deacon said. “We don’t see … that particular statistic as affecting schools at the high end of the applicant pool.”
Tamara Jayasundera, research professor and senior economist for Georgetown’s Center on Education and the Workforce, agreed, expressing concern that those who really could benefit from the added earnings of college were often the ones choosing not to enroll.
“Over the lifetime, a four-year graduate worker, on average, earns $2.3 million compared to the $1.3 million earned by a worker with a high school diploma. Thus, it is troubling that young adults from poor and disadvantaged households are unable to afford the high price tag of college tuition [and] are opting out of a college education,” Jayasundera wrote in an email.
Though Gordon agreed, pointing to declines at two-year colleges as the key indicator driving the BLS statistics, she hypothesized that students considering Georgetown also face a challenging decision as a result of the recession and the subsequent recovery.
“It’s people who are on that margin. It’s such a big and segmented market. I don’t think any of the students at Georgetown were deciding, ‘Should I go to Georgetown, or should I get a job?’ They’re thinking, ‘Should I go to Georgetown or my flagship state university that’s giving me a scholarship?’ Other people are on the margin between two-year and four-year college. Other people are on the margin between two-year college and working full time,” she said.
The administration thus appears to face the challenge of reaching out to students who may not apply because of increasing tuition costs or the fear of not graduating.
“Places that are selective are, by definition, at capacity: They’re rejecting applicants. Their number of enrolled students is not going to change; the composition of those students might change,” Gordon said. “They might have a harder time recruiting … students who don’t apply because they’re deterred by the sticker price.”
Deacon recognized this issue and pointed to joint efforts carried out by top universities specifically aimed to offset this problem and encourage on-the-fence students to apply.
“Many, many students who have the right credentials don’t even try getting into college. The problem is, there’s no way of specifically identifying them. … Our best effort is done through the joint recruitment program, with four other major universities [Stanford University, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, and Duke University], which literally goes to all corners of the country,” Deacon said.
Deacon also highlighted efforts such as the Georgetown Scholarship Program, which offers resources and networks to students regardless of socioeconomic status, as crucial to maintaining high graduation rates, which, in turn, would incentivize students to attend Georgetown.
“If you can get into Georgetown, the predicted outcome is that you can graduate at a 95 percent rate, and that changes the whole dynamic, in terms of your opportunity. If you’re going to a school where it’s predicted that only 30 percent of you will graduate, you’ll have second thoughts about whether that decision is right for you,” he said.
Jayasundera stressed the need to keep tuition costs manageable for students, as well, especially with increased media attention to the issue and state schools becoming less affordable for students.
“Though Georgetown and other selective private universities are not affected by the declining enrollment, mounting pressure can lead them to have to take steps to moderate their tuition increases. … As state budgets thinned during the recession, many states cut higher education support dramatically, and more of the burden of paying for college transferred from the state to the student,” she said.
