The ReImagine Georgetown Grant program received 14 applications this year, four fewer than last year’s total.
According to Ryan Muldoon (COL ’13), chair of the philanthropy committee of Students of Georgetown, Inc. and RIG board member, those on the board struggled to effectively advertise and encourage applications.
“We already have a lot on our plate as board members, so it’s really an effort to put the due diligence into the legwork that really makes RIG feasible and effective,” Muldoon said.
Applications for the 2012 RIG grants were due Sunday, and the board will announce the winners no later than Nov. 12.
Sponsored by The Corp, the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union and The Hoya, the RIG program grants a maximum of $10,000 to fund student proposals that help shape life on campus. Programs started via RIG grants include the Georgetown University Farmers’ Market, Breaking the Bubble — a program that allows students to participate in the community outside the front gates — and The Georgetown Conversation, an online forum where students and faculty can post video lectures
“RIG is really a place for people with big ideas and projects that might otherwise be cost-prohibitive. RIG is an opportunity for those projects to come to life,” Muldoon said.
The Corp and GUASFCU each donated $5,000, while The Hoya contributed marketing and advertising resources. The board is not required to award the entire amount each year and sometimes splits funding among multiple proposals.
Justin Kwan (MSB ’13), treasurer for both GUASFCU and RIG, cited a lack of continuity between current and past boards as an obstacle to bolstering the number of applications.
“We only met with the old RIG board once,” Kwan said. “So to be honest, I don’t really know. We don’t really know a lot about what happened last year.”
Before the application deadline, the RIG board held three open houses throughout the month of October.
“A lot of people came with questions about the budget or about their projects and to get feedback,”RIG Secretary and Chair of The Corp Service and Outreach Committee Meg Cheney (NHS ’13) said.
She also commented on the open houses.
“It’s just a very different application process than other competitions for grants on campus.”
The application was posted online on The Corp’s website and consisted of three questions and a budget plan.
All applicants will be interviewed by the RIG board to discuss their plans and their budgets.
There is no limit on the amount of money an applicant can request, but Kwan said that the board maintains a high standard.
“We’re not required to give out the $10,000 every year, so we’re really looking for the ideas that will truly benefit the students at Georgetown,” Kwan said.
Cheney also emphasized the flexibility the board has in determining grant awards.
“It’s a really open-ended process,” Cheney said. “It’s really based on the applicants and what we see in their ideas.”
After the winners are announced, the RIG board maintains contact to ensure that all proposals are completed.
“Each member of the board is assigned [to] winners to be their mentor,” Cheney said. “We also have people checking in with people who have won past years’ awards. Also, their money is managed inGUASFCU accounts, so they have to deal with someone from our board always to access the money.”
According to Kwan, the mentorship program aims to prevent initiatives from dying out once funding has been granted.
“The responsibility is really on us,” Kwan said. “In the past, some organizations have kind of fallen off and died out, but we’re really making it a priority this year.”
In addition, the board is considering methods of increasing awareness of the program. One option involves changing the application deadline from the fall to the spring, which would enable the board to focus on advertising and raising awareness during the fall and launch the application and deliberation process in the spring.
“Ultimately, I think it will lead to more applications, and I also think the lack of marketing has really led to the smaller applicant pool,” Kwan said. “I really think that RIG is so underutilized, and it could really make such a difference in students’ lives.”

According to Peter Beinart of The Daily Beast, neither President Obama nor Governor Romney won the recent foreign policy debate. The real winner was George W. Bush because “the framework for understanding the world that he put in place after Sept. 11 still holds.” He describes this framework as the viewing of foreign policy almost through an exclusively military lens.
I would actually argue the opposite. The reason why there was so little conflict in the debate is because both candidates envision a world where American power is driven more by economics and relationships than boots on the ground.
While much of the debate was focused on Afghanistan and Iraq, what stood out was the level of agreement between the two candidates on significant military withdrawals.
For instance, both Obama and Romney support keeping the United States out of Syria as well as removing an American military presence from the country by the end of 2014.
On the issue of China, both candidates appreciate that the country is quickly becoming a global superpower, if it is not already. Moreover, Obama and Romney both understand the increasing sensitivity on the issue of China in many parts of the United States.
For his part, Romney has pledged to label China a “currency manipulator” and to generally push a tougher line. Obama has responded by using the power of incumbency to press trade cases against China at the World Trade Organization.
Most of Romney’s criticisms of Obama’s foreign policy are relatively broad, centering on the theme that the president has apologized too much for the United States’ actions. These relatively minor grievances are just another indication of how the differences between the two candidates are sometimes more based on tone than actual policy.
Even though the GOP has been dominated for most of my own life by neoconservatives who support military interventions internally by and large, the Republican Party also has a substantial isolationist component embodied in some ways by Rand and Ron Paul.
The era when Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) were emblematic of the GOP foreign policy establishment are fast dissolving. In its place are an increasing number of Republicans who are asking whether Americans can afford as many commitments abroad, especially as the deficit becomes a greater and greater risk to long-term American vitality.
The reality is that it is difficult for Republicans to criticize the president’s record, as under the Obama administration the United States has had a slew of victories abroad, such as bringing Osama Bin Laden to justice. Obama has also finally ended the disastrous war in Iraq and set a timetable for American soldiers leaving Afghanistan.
At the same, the United States has worked to shift its focus towards Asia, which is fast becoming the center of global geopolitics. Obama has worked to expand upon historic relationships with countries such as South Korea and Japan while broadening American military presence in the region to countries such as Australia.
While foreign policy is traditionally an issue that benefits Republicans, it appears to be the opposite in this election. In the instant CBS polls after the recent debate, viewers selected Obama as the winner by as much as 30 points. Couple this with the fact that Secretary of State Hilary Clinton has a stratospheric 66 percent approval rating, her highest in almost 15 years.
These relative successes have resulted in the GOP and Romney adopting policies similar to those of the president.
In the end, regardless of who is elected president, the United States will end up with a roughly similar foreign policy. In contrast to what Beinart argues, this country will increasingly view the world through an economic, rather than military, perspective.

As the oldest and perhaps best-known Catholic and Jesuit university in the country, Georgetown has a unique opportunity to represent the tenets of that heritage. One of the founding ideals of that Jesuit tradition is that one must use one’s talents not simply to enrich oneself, but to enrich the lives of others. As the university states on its website, educating “men and women in the service of others, especially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of the community … [is] at the core of Georgetown’s identity.” One way in which students use their talents for society’s benefit is through community service. From Habitat for Humanity to D.C. Reads and Alternative Spring Break, Georgetown students participate in a wide variety of service activities. But should the school be doing more? As it does with general education or foreign languages, the university ought to consider making community service a mandatory component of the Georgetown education. There are several ways in which a community service requirement would benefit the Georgetown community. First, it would fit with the Jesuit tradition of being socially conscious and willing to sacrifice for those who are less fortunate. Making community service mandatory would show that Georgetown is committed to inculcating the values of service and responsibility in all its students. The university has requirements in the curriculum that stem from its particular mission, and those prescriptions could reasonably extend to other aspects of campus life as well. Such a requirement would also strengthen Georgetown’s identity in relation to other universities and provide a unique example of how the university’s Jesuit principles actively inform its policies.In addition, placing more emphasis on community service could bolster the Georgetown community. For many students, doing community service is meant to be a punishment — assigned because of violations of the Code of Student Conduct. Having all Georgetown students participate in community service as part of their education would introduce service in a positive light, rather than a negative one. This could promote more students doing service above and beyond the requirement, as their initial experiences would be enriching and constructive. Students would also have the opportunity to build new relationships and strengthen the on-campus community through their shared experiences with helping those in need.Students can make an impact on the greater D.C. area by donating their time and energy in several ways. We are privileged to live in a comfortable neighborhood on a vibrant and growing campus. With that privilege comes a responsibility to use our resources to aid those who live in dire need — often only a short distance from the front gates. Increasing the number of Georgetown students performing community service would provide much-needed assistance to the organizations that address issues of poverty and public health every day. Implementing this requirement would not be very onerous, from either an administrative or an educational standpoint. Given that service is already an integral part of Georgetown’s identity, it is not a radical decision to solidify that service requirement as part of a Georgetown education. The obligation need not be an extremely burdensome time commitment, simply long enough so that students may gain a full appreciation of the value of community service. A service requirement would emphasize the connection between the principles that one learns in a classroom and the realities of life in a major city, and Georgetown would be well served to ensure that students have an opportunity to exercise the values that it seeks to instill in them.

Natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina still haunt the nation’s memory, and it would be irresponsible to take the threat of another large storm lightly.
As the torrential rains and violent winds of Hurricane Sandy slam the East Coast, it’s important to remember that the risk of underpreparation is much graver than that of being too prepared.
The national media have been giving Sandy a huge amount of attention. Some criticize news outlets for playing off hype and exploiting people’s fears to boost ratings. The constant stream of news updates, however, is necessary to make viewers aware of the consequences of the storm and compel them to stay safe and informed. Letting people spend too much time in front of the television and too much money stocking up on groceries is an acceptable price to pay when the alternative is vulnerability to a preventable disaster.
In keeping with this perspective, we feel the university has taken the necessary, proactive steps to brace itself for Hurricane Sandy. Although cancelling classes is a big decision, there was nothing to be gained from holding out and putting members of the Georgetown community at risk.
The university’s preparations have been helpful and timely. The HOYAlert system notified students about class cancelations on Monday and Tuesday through text messages, email and phone calls, proving itself to be an effective tool for mass communication with the student body.
The administration did more than simply cancel classes. As early as last Friday, the university sent out emails with information on ways to prepare for the hurricane. The backup generator stationed by the Southwest Quad on Monday morning is a testament to the university’s level of preparedness.
Georgetown also took steps to ensure access to food during the storm, a major concern for students. Students were notified that there would be expanded Grab ‘n’ Go options and were encouraged to go to O’Donovan Hall before 3 p.m. to pick up food before a “shelter in place” alert was issued. Unfortunately, around 1 p.m., the shelves at Grab ‘n’ Go were virtually bare.
The university has had to take rapid steps to prepare for the hurricane, and as of press time, it looks to have acted effectively. While the administration’s eagerness to capitalize on photo ops that showed a ready response — having a photographer accompany President John J. DeGioia to his appearance in O’Donovan Hall, for example — may have been unnecessary, it doesn’t seem to have detracted from the work that has been done to prepare.
Many remember the buildup for Hurricane Irene in August 2011 and the aftermath that didn’t live up to expectations. But we should not live out the story of the boy who cried wolf. When storms turn out to be less severe than anticipated, it doesn’t mean that our precautions were unwarranted or that we should become complacent when the next storm approaches.
In such cases, it’s always better to be safe than sorry.

A penalty kick stopped cold. A free kick crossing the line without a whistle. Another penalty kick miss.
For 83 minutes, the No. 6 Georgetown men’s soccer team (15-2-1, 6-2-0 Big East) couldn’t catch a break with a divisional title on the line against Seton Hall (6-11-0, 2-6-0) on Senior Day.
Go figure that it’d be a freshman that would end up delivering the win.
Striker Brandon Allen — who leads the Hoyas in both points and goals in his rookie campaign — provided the breakthrough in the 84th minute of regulation, collecting an unselfish ball in the box from senior midfielder Andy Riemer and burying it into the bottom-right corner to seal his team’s second Big East Blue Division title in three years.
“It’s awesome,” senior defender and co-captain Jimmy Nealis said afterward. “This is the second time around that I’ve been through this feeling, and Senior Day is awesome, but winning the trophy is better. I’d rather do that every time.”
“It’s no small feat,” Head Coach Brian Wiese said. “It’s just validation for the quality [team] that they are and the character they have, and I’m really happy for them.”
Wiese and Nealis were hardly the only ones that were riding high in the wake of the victory, as thepostgame trophy presentation aptly demonstrated.
It was a trophy that was hard earned, and, was it not for a late-season turnaround, one that never would have actually made it to the Hilltop.
Following back-to-back losses in early October to then-No. 2 UConn and then-No. 10 Notre Dame — their first two defeats of the season — the Blue and Gray needed a serious reversal of fortune. A hardening of mentality did the trick.
“We had five games [left], and we said, ‘Look, we have to be perfect,’” Wiese explained. “We knew we could win every single one, and it was then just a matter of lining each one up individually and take care of it.”
The last of those regular-season dominoes fell on Saturday at home, but the Pirates didn’t go down easily.
Dominating possession as usual in the early going, Georgetown looked to have gotten itself on the board in the 15th minute, when Allen drew a foul in the Seton Hall box. Senior midfielder IanChristianson stepped to the spot to take the ensuing penalty, but his shot to the goalie’s right was easily turned aside.
Less than two minutes later, junior forward Steve Neumann appeared to have scored on a free kick, but the referee made no call. Wiese proceeded to furiously appeal the call on the sidelines to no avail, and the game somehow remained scoreless in spite of that incredibly hectic stretch.
“I heard from a lot of people that it did cross the line, people that were close to it, but the ref said he didn’t see it, so there’s nothing we could really do about that,” Neumann said.
A Riemer header straight at the Pirate goalkeeper from point-blank range in the 24th minute constituted the Hoyas’ last decent chance of the half, as the two sides went into halftime scoreless.
Allen had a near-post rip soon after the intermission that was parried wide by the keeper, and what followed soon afterward was a serious dose of deja vu.
Ten minutes into the half, freshman midfielder Melvin Snoh became the second Georgetown player to be taken down in the area, and Wiese opted to give the kick to Neumann this time after Christianson’smiss. Despite the change in personnel from the first, though, what resulted was nearly identical, as Neumann again shot to the goalie’s right and was likewise denied.
It was the visitors who then began to threaten, forcing sophomore Tomas Gomez into three big-time saves around a half-hour from time in order to preserve his clean sheet.
Finally, with less than six minutes in the match, Riemer found Allen to secure the Blue and Gray’s second win over Seton Hall in as many games.
“We created plenty of chances, and it was just a matter of finishing them,” Wiese said. “[There were so many times] that it was skirting across the line, and we’re getting a foot on it, but it somehow doesn’t go [exactly] in the right direction.
“We knew the first goal was going to be hard today, and it just took a little longer than we would’ve liked.”
Flashy or not, Georgetown’s performance nonetheless brought the three points that it needed to gain a share of the Big East title.
As a two seed in the Big East tournament, the Hoyas will now have a bye to the quarterfinals, where they will face a tough opponent at home in No. 18 St. John’s (10-3-4, 4-3-1 Big East).
The Red Storm is 7-0-1 in the last eight games of the series, having knocked the Blue and Gray out of last season’s tournament in their most recent meeting.
“The boys worked hard, but we know we still have work to do,” Neumann said. “One of our goals [the entire season has been] getting to Red Bull Arena for the semifinals, and that’s definitely something that we want to achieve.”
“We’re feeling good,” Nealis echoed. “We can’t let down, can’t take anything else as given to us. We’ve got to keep working.”

The Georgetown field hockey team (2-17, 0-6 Big East) finished its season with a whimper, losing its final two games last weekend to Villanova (7-12, 2-4 Big East) and No. 11 Lafayette (15-1, 5-0 Patriot League) by scores of 5-3 and 7-0, respectively.
Sunday’s defeat marked the career finale for 10 Georgetown seniors, the largest senior class that Head Coach Tiffany Marsh has ever had.
The weekend began with a tense clash with the Wildcats, where the Hoyas twice threatened to close a three-goal deficit but failed to complete the comeback, with Villanova sophomore forward Leah High scoring four of her team’s five goals.
The Wildcats jumped on the Hoyas early, scoring three goals in the first nine minutes of the game.
After quickly falling behind, the Blue and Gray staved off several Villanova shots with the help of two saves from senior goalkeeper Briana Pereira. Georgetown then struck back, as senior midfielder Caitlin Hickey scored off of a penalty corner from freshman midfielder Emily Weinberg.
The Hoyas continued their comeback attempt at the beginning of the second half, when senior forward Annie Wilson scored just 20 seconds in. However, Georgetown could not tie the game, as Villanova’s High added another goal to her tally to restore her team’s advantage.
After another flurry of Villanova shots, the Blue and Gray staged one last comeback attempt with a goal by freshman forward Sarah Butterfield in the 64th minute. High erased any doubt of the game’s final outcome, though, by scoring a fourth goal during a fast break with seven minutes remaining.
If the Hoyas considered their close loss at Villanova to be any kind of moral victory, their first half destruction at the hands of Lafayette erased the lingering good feelings.
The Leopards came into the game shooting and recorded a remarkable 20 shots in the first half, while the Hoyas could not attempt a single one. Thanks to superb goalkeeping by Pereira — who finished the game with 14 saves — Lafayette could not score until the game’s 15th minute. After that, unfortunately, a goal from senior forward Deanna Dicroce opened the floodgates, as Lafayette scored three goals at the end of the first half.
In the second half, the Hoyas turned much of the momentum, attempting the same number of shots as Lafayette in the period. However, this shift was not reflected in the score, as Lafayette scored four goals in the first 20 minutes of the second half, including two in the 51st minute. Although Georgetown threatened to score in the final minutes, it was ultimately shut out for the fourth time this season.
Along with Pereira, Hickey and Wilson, Georgetown seniors who played their final games were midfielder Claire Mittermiller, forward Catherine Shugrue, forward Charlotte Tierney, midfielder Laura Thistle, midfielder Kimberley Keating, forward Molly McShea and midfielder Katy Wingo.

It’s funny how we look at history.
We sneer at the barbarians and stick our noses up in the air as if the present moment in time is far superior. How brutal those ancients were! Naked wrestling matches? Gladiators dueling in the Coliseum? Fights to-the-death against lions and bears? It is amazing how people actually found these gruesome competitions entertaining.
Or is it?
We think so highly of ourselves, proudly applauding the “progress” of the human race. We call our society “civilized” and “cultured” without even knowing what these terms really mean or to whom exactly we are comparing ourselves. We think we have tamed our society, overcoming the barbarism of the past. Such foolish pride.
“Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose,” my high school English teacher used to say. The more things change, the more they stay the same.
This simple phrase reveals the grim reality of human sport. Two thousand years after naked wrestling and gladiator duels, we remain captivated by the fierce, barbaric passions of athletic competition. Admittedly, we no longer strangle each other with bare hands or stab opponents with swords. With rulebooks, penalties, jerseys, and instituted leagues, our passionate desire for combat is more concealed than in the past. We show occasional expressions of sportsmanship for the sake of civility.
But these regulations remain nothing but a mask. A brutal viciousness remains at the heart of sports. We scream for hard hits and filthy I-just-destroyed-you facials. Even baseball, one of the most passive sports ever invented, is dominated by a superbly violent act: a ball whizzing through the air like a missile, flying at you at speeds up to one hundred miles per hour. Talk about scary.
But of all sports, nothing better demonstrates the dynamic of violence than football. The players are today’s equivalent of gladiators. They perform in giant coliseums in front of thousands of wild fans. Jacked 250-pound giants run at each other at full speed, armed with metal helmets that transform the players themselves into weapons. Their goal is a fiercely carnal one: to force the opponent onto the ground against his will, by any means necessary. They tear at arms, trip legs, and smash into each other like battering rams for three straight hours.
It is a brutal war of attrition. There are no intermediaries; it is man against man, and his only instrument is himself.
Physical trauma naturally follows. They may not be fighting to the death, but they get awfully close. Concussions, broken bones, torn ligaments, and even paralysis are the price that our gladiators pay. All of this, for the sake of advancing a leather ball a few yards at a time.
Doesn’t sound very civilized, does it? Players are getting faster and stronger every year, and despite new rules that seek to prevent helmet-to-helmet contact and other dangerous plays, it is impossible to completely eliminate risk on the gridiron. The sport is just too fast and unpredictable. Some players get caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.
The inherent danger of football is jeopardizing the future of the sport. While we love watching players get “jacked up,” we also cringe at the rawness of the violence. It becomes less entertaining and more revolting.
Parents are more hesitant about letting their children play football, encouraging relatively safer sports like baseball and basketball. In addition, more than 2,000 former players filed a massive lawsuit against the league this summer, arguing that the NFL “exacerbated the health risk by promoting the game’s violence” and misled players about the long-term effects of concussions. Bad public relations threaten the reputability of the league.
Fearing a generational decrease in interest, the NFL recently launched an effort to rebuild interest in the sport from the bottom up.
Commissioner Roger Goodell visited a youth league practice this October to preach about changing the culture of the game. He spoke to players and coaches about proper tackling techniques and safety concerns. The NFL also released a thirty-second commercial featuring Tom Brady and Ray Lewis, in which they stress new on-the-field rules that encourage safety, as well as the off-the-field initiatives like new medical research and better equipment.
However, there are questions about how effective the new initiatives will be. The league can tweak how the game is played, but it can never change the nature of the sport itself. It will always be physical and violent game, and the NFL can only do so much before football no longer resembles football. It may suffer a decrease in popularity at the grass-roots level, but there will always be people crazy enough to pick up the brutal sport.
Our gladiators march on, and we remain transfixed by our secret love of barbarity.

Culture and athletic identity are always related. In New Zealand, they play rugby; in Canada, hockey. These implanted allegiances to certain sports and certain teams aren’t necessarily based on winning — in Dallas, you’ll see more fans watch the Cowboys take to the gridiron than the Stars hit the ice, no matter the teams’ records.
The Los Angeles Kings won the Stanley Cup last season, and media outlets responded by mispronouncing the names of stars Anze Kopitar and Drew Doughty as “Kopidor” and “Brad Doty,” respectively, and mistakenly presenting a logo of basketball’s Sacramento Kings on a news broadcast. Considering that the Lakers and Clippers had long since been eliminated from their respective playoffs, one would have thought the Kings would have been given some respect. It didn’t happen.
This discrepancy in popularity is exhibited at the college level to an even greater extent,. Despite the fact that the team hasn’t won more than one NCAA tournament match in a year since 2007, Georgetown men’s basketball gets all the fan attention on campus.
This is a product of culture and tradition, just as it is with Notre Dame or Michigan football — both of which have struggled in recent years.
“Growing up, my family — my dad being an alum — always had season basketball tickets,” Mike Oliver, a Washington native and current Georgetown sophomore, told me. “[My passion for basketball] did not translate to other Georgetown sports. If I had to speculate, I would say it’s mainly because of a lack of exposure at the time and a lack of alumni interest.”
Meanwhile, the Hilltop features two of the top soccer teams in the country, but, at least as far as attendance goes, few people have seemed to notice. When the then-No. 3 men’s team played then-No. 2 Connecticut, there were plenty of empty seats to see the men’s team at North Kehoe Field, which boasts a capacity of only 1,474. Meanwhile, the Huskies themselves regularly sell out their 5,100-seat stadium.
The Blue and Gray men’s team sits No. 6 in the country; the women’s team is No. 14. Meanwhile, the men’s basketball team isn’t expected to be a top-25 team this year — although the same was said before last season — yet the Verizon Center will be rocking on opening day nevertheless.
There are those that will claim that this is just the way things are and cite sports such as sailing, at which Georgetown thrives. Regattas will probably never be highly attended, but soccer isn’t sailing.
Soccer is the most popular sport in the world — the most played and the most attended. Even North America’s Major League Soccer has been growing in popularity, recently surpassing the NBA and NHL in attendance per game. It’s the beautiful game, and it is an exciting spectacle to watch, even if — or maybe because — there isn’t scoring every 30 seconds.
Georgetown has the American U-20 national team keeper in sophomore Tomas Gomez and one of the best freshmen in the country in striker Brandon Allen. It’s a team that will compete for a national title, and it’s a lot closer for students than Verizon Center.
Allen, who leads the Big East in goals, will undoubtedly be a top MLS draft pick in 2014, at which point he will likely see crowds as large as 50,000 people. Sophomore midfielder Daphne Corboz, the star of the women’s team, may have a future with the US women’s national team and may compete at future Olympics.
It’s a shame, however, that we can’t prepare these incredible talents for their careers to come with the kinds of crowds they — and their entire teams — deserve. They may not be as well known on campus as basketball players like sophomore forward Otto Porter and junior point guard Markel Starks, but they should be.
There is a chance to turn this around. If either of these teams manages to come close to a national title this season, we can hope the whole campus will be behind them.

Georgetown has the 17th-best value of American private colleges, according to an Oct. 24 ranking byKiplinger’s Magazine.
According to a Kiplinger’s press release, the ranking of more than 600 private institutions throughout the United States considered a wide variety of factors, including admissions rates, tuition, fees and graduation rates. The study also reflected the percentage of financial aid needs met, a figure that is 100 percent at Georgetown.
While Georgetown’s cost of attendance, which includes tuition, room and board, textbook expenses and other fees, is $57,282 — higher than all but five other institutions included in the ranking — its graduation rate of 90.1 percent, the second highest on the list, is topped only by the University of Notre Dame.
Yale, Rice, and Princeton Universities fill the first, second and third spots in the Kiplinger’s ranking, respectively.
Georgetown’s value is the top ranked of all private universities in the District of Columbia. The George Washington University ranked 49th, American University 59th and Catholic University of America 99th. According to Katherine Sisemore (MSB ’15), however, the ranking helped legitimize the tuition she pays to attend Georgetown.
“When I told my dad about it, it definitely made him feel better about our tuition, and I think that in all honesty, that is bolstered by the starting salaries especially with the business school students. It shows how this institution prepares us to compete in the job market,” she said. “People do well out of every single major here.”

All Georgetown campuses in the D.C. metropolitan area have been closed Monday and Tuesday as the city readies itself for the worst of Hurricane Sandy.
The university issued a shelter-in-place warning around 5:30 p.m. Monday. The notification, which was sent out via HOYAlert, urged members of the campus community to stay indoors as the full force of the Category 1 storm hits the District.
“DANGEROUS CONDITIONS EXIST OUTDOORS,” a text sent to HOYAlert subscribers read. “DO NOT GO OUTSIDE UNTIL AN ‘ALL CLEAR’ IS ISSUED.”
Hurricane Sandy, which has increased in intensity as it travels up the East Coast, is expected to bring heavy rains and wind gusts of up to 70 miles per hour to the D.C. area. Federal and D.C. government offices are closed through Tuesday, and Metrorail and Metrobus services are canceled.
The university closures were announced in broadcast emails sent to the campus community Sunday evening and Monday morning. In addition to cancelling classes, the university has taken several steps to prepare for the oncoming storm. An emergency command center was put in place 8 a.m. Monday. The center is staffed by members of the Department of Public Safety, the Office of Student Affairs, the Office of Residence Life, University Information Services, the Office of Risk Management, University Facilities, Auxiliary Services and the Office of Public Affairs and will be running 24 hours a day for the duration of the storm, according to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr.
Kerr added that emergency response teams and DPS have been monitoring data about the storm and are subscribed to information services not available to the general public.
In the meantime, the storm has prompted a wave of building closures throughout campus. Lauinger Library closed at noon Monday, the Leavey Center Grab ʻnʼ Go closed at 3 p.m. and Yates Field House and university food services will close at 4 p.m. today, concurrent with the shelter-in-place notification.
The broadcast email that announced the shelter-in-place policy urged students to take food from OʼDonovan Hall and Grab ʻnʼ Go before the facilities close. According to Kerr, the amount of food available in OʼDonovan Hall is running low.
In addition, Georgetown has set up an emergency generator outside the Southwest Quad to deal with the possibility of a power outage.
“Based on all current weather forecasts that we are monitoring and the advising of local utility companies, we are preparing for the possibility of a loss of power,” Kerr wrote in an email. Our emergency generators will power life-saving services like alarms and emergency exists in the event of a loss of power. … Students are encouraged to make preparations to be without power.”
Students of Georgetown, Inc., services were also affected by the hurricane. More Uncommon Grounds and Midnight MUG are both closed, and Vital Vittles will close early so that employees don’t have to walk home after dark.
According to Chief Operating Officer Stephanie Wolfram (MSB ’13), shelves at Vital Vittles have been wiped clean.
“Yesterday, we had a huge influx of customers,” she said. “It started around 1 p.m. All of a sudden everyone wanted to get stuff. … Average purchases have been over $20.”
Wolfram also expressed concern about Corp locations losing electricity in the case of a power outage.
“[The university] really wants to make sure Leavey doesn’t lose power,” she said. “If they do, that becomes an issue for the university. We would have to work through it because there would be spoilage.”

Several services in the District of Columbia remained suspended Monday evening, with disruptions expected to continue on Tuesday and later in the week as Hurricane Sandy worsens.
An alert from the D.C. government sent around 9 p.m. warned that the storm is expected to enter its strongest phase this evening, with winds gusting up to 60 miles per hour and rainfall continuing steadily.
The alert advised residents to avoid driving and urged them to keep roads free for emergency vehicles.
According to The Washington Post, the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority has announced that Metro and bus services, including the DC Circulator, will remain suspended Tuesday morning while WMATA determines damage done to the system.
The Federal Government also announced that it will remain closed on Tuesday. All federal government workers, except for emergency workers, those required to telework and those on business outside the District, will be excused from work tomorrow, according to The Washington Post.
The D.C. government is also expected to be closed on Tuesday.
An article in the Georgetown Patch cited a National Weather Service post that high flooding from the Potomac River can be expected by Thursday, as water levels are expected to exceed 15 feet. Water levels stood at 3.7 feet at 5 p.m. Monday, according to Georgetown Patch.
“Residents and businesses along the Potomac River … including [in] Washington, D.C., should prepare for a flood not seen since the floods of 1996,” a press release from the service said, referencing flooding caused by Hurricane Fran in August, 1996.
The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority reported Oct. 26 that it expects its drinking water treatment facilities to remain open despite the hurricane.
Pepco, which supplies electricity to the District of Columbia, reported that close to 3,000 customers are without power as of 9 p.m. Monday. According to an Oct. 29 press release, Pepco has arranged for an additional 1,500 staff from as far away as Texas and Mississippi to assist in restoration efforts. Citing a high volume of outages, the company has suspended its estimated time of restoration feature until further notice.
Several local Georgetown business were also boarded up and closed on Monday in anticipation of hurricane damages.

MTV filmed students asking questions of President Barack Obama live in Healy Circle Friday afternoon.
MTV News correspondent Andrew Jenks interviewed nearly 40 students, who were selected by the MTV production crew through an application process Wednesday. The student questions were filmed concurrent with a televised live interview with President Barack Obama.
Jenks invited students to ask questions during the online show, which were then relayed to MTV News Correspondent Sway Calloway so he could incorporate them into his interview with the president that was aired on TV.
Students’ questions focused on the economy, renewable energy, women’s issues and gay rights.
“I think it’s really great that we can have a president go on MTV and talk about marriage equality, but the Defense of Marriage Act is still on the books, and we shouldn’t just leave this to states,” TuckerCholvin (SFS ’15), a student participant said after the event. “This is a civil rights issue.”
Energy was also a hot button discussion topic during the event.
“We’re not moving as fast as we need to be,” President Obama said during the interview. “That said, we doubled fuel efficiency on cars and trucks and doubled clean energy production.”
Scott Ruona (MSB’ 15), another student participant, was impressed by Obama’s answer.
“In my opinion, the president was most clear in his response to new energy resources. He was specific and outlined a plan he could be accountable for,” he said.
MTV spokesperson Janice Gatti said the network was immediately drawn to Georgetown when trying to choose a location for the filming.
“The university [plays host to] a diverse range of incredibly talented, bright students, and the campus itself offers a great backdrop for the special,” she said.
The university’s Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said that Georgetown was approached earlier this week to play host to the event. MTV explored the other universities in the District as well.
“It represents a unique experience for our students to continue to engage in our political process as they make decisions about whom to support in the presidential election,” Pugh said.
Jenks echoed Pugh’s sentiments.
“I was impressed at how articulate everyone was,” Jenks said. “They knew the issues and were very specific in what they wanted to hear from the president.”
Branden Oliver (SFS ’15), another student who was interviewed by Jenks, said that the event was interesting but not particularly informative.
“Obviously it’s a great thing for a president to take time out to answer the questions of a bunch of college students, but it definitely wasn’t hard-hitting enough to bring me to any conclusion,” he said.
