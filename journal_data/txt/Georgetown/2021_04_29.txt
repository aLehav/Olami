Georgetown University students are calling on the university’s South Asian Society to initiate structural reforms to increase board representation, transparency and inclusivity. 
Georgetown University Students 4 South Asia, an unaffiliated student-led campaign, published a petition April 20 calling on the South Asian Society to change the board selection process to be more accessible and representative of the Georgetown community. The petition has garnered over 100 signatures from Georgetown community members as of April 28.
The changes for which the petition advocates will strengthen the South Asian community on campus and expand the South Asian Society’s reach, according to the petition.
“By actively encouraging greater inclusion of the general body through these key points, we can promote greater representation and facilitate a learning, welcoming environment for all South Asian students at Georgetown University,” the petition reads.
Currently, the SAS board is selected through both a general body vote and interviews conducted by a committee of SAS members, with both processes sharing equal weight. The petition calls for SAS to eliminate board candidate interviews in favor of adhering to a general body vote in line with other cultural clubs on campus to reduce board selection based on personal relationships and increase representation.
Many students involved in drafting the petition have felt culturally excluded while involved with SAS, according to Nirvana Khan (SFS ’24), an active member of the South Asian community at Georgetown and a part of the GUSFSA campaign. 
“A couple weeks ago I started getting very frustrated because I’m from Bangladesh, and I felt like I was really missing the Bengali community at Georgetown,” Khan said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “I thought that the South Asian Society would fill that void for me, but I don’t feel engaged by them at all.”
SAS programming has historically been India-centric and Hindu-centric, including SAS’s flagship event, Rangila, a philanthropic showcase of South Asian dances, according to Khan.
“I was really surprised that they don’t have a Bengali dance at Rangila. There are 12 dances and not one of them is Bengali,” Khan said. “As a Muslim, I definitely don’t feel super included by the fact that there are often lots of recognition of big Indian holidays like Holi, Diwali, Garba, but no recognition of Ramadan or Eid.”
Alongside their petition for structural reform, GUSFSA’s campaign is collecting and publishing anonymous testimonials about social and cultural issues within SAS. Testimonials reference casteism, anti-Black racism and a lack of accountability around sexual assault.
According to an anonymous testimonial, SAS does not sincerely attempt to understand the complexities and dynamics that affect all of South Asia.
“Coming from eastern India, I see little to no representation of my culture, cuisine, practices, or even the realities of what it means to be from somewhere that is NOT Gujarat or Punjab,” the testimonial reads.
SAS recognizes the concerns the testimonials have raised and plans to work to foster inclusivity through changes within the organization, according to SAS President Nethra Viswanathan (SFS ’22).
“Obviously it was very disheartening to see because we want the South Asian Society to be as inclusive and a home for everybody and make sure that it’s a space where everyone feels comfortable,” Vishwanathan said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “We are an imperfect organization, just like every other organization on this campus, and we have tons of work to do in terms of the way that we can be inclusive.”
Following GUSFSA’s advocacy, the SAS board announced reforms in response to the petition during an April 26 town hall aimed at gathering feedback and discussing SAS’s future. The proposed reforms meet some of the petition’s demands, including improved election transparency and greater diversity and representation within the club. However, the board selection process will still require an interview component, according to SAS board members who spoke at the town hall.
The interview prevents board positions from being awarded unfairly and paves a way for minority groups and first-year students to have a more equal chance of being selected, according to Vishwanathan.
“The reason that the interview was created for the SAS board to begin with was because people felt that the general body vote became a popularity contest,” Vishwanathan said at the town hall. “People would vote for their friends, and they wouldn’t reflect on what the community actually wants.”
In response to GUSFA’s criticism, SAS published a new online form for community members to list holidays that are important to them. SAS will use the results to create better cultural representation within the club, according to Vishwanathan. 
“I know that there is so much cultural and religious diversity within South Asia, and we need to do a better job of addressing all of it,” Vishwanathan said in a Zoom interview with the Hoya. 
Although SAS has yet to initiate all of the petition’s reforms, the town hall and proposed reforms to elections and structure are still signs of progress, according to Khan.
“Overall, I believe that the board is trying to do better. I think this is an important stepping stone to our final destination,” Khan said.

Georgetown University students are calling on the university to lessen sanctions for marijuana violations in an effort to reflect marijuana legalization in Washington, D.C., and changing attitudes nationwide.
Georgetown’s Student Advocacy Office, a student-run resource center that helps students navigate the university’s disciplinary system, shared its proposal via Instagram on April 20. The proposal, which had over 130 student signatures as of April 29, is advocating for a marijuana policy separate from those for other drugs and pushing for equal sanctions for both marijuana and alcohol violations. 
The university’s policy should mirror the District’s legislation and consequences, according to Daniel Shlayen (SFS ’21), a member of SAO.
“D.C. is a very progressive area with progressive new laws on marijuana,” Shlayen said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “To me, it was kind of ridiculous that people were getting into so much more trouble for smoking weed than they were getting in for drinking alcohol when it was equally legal outside of Georgetown’s campus.”
Recreational marijuana use was legalized for adults 21 and older under D.C. law in 2015, but the university’s drug policy and sanctioning guidelines do not distinguish between marijuana and other drugs. 
Under current university policy, student infractions involving marijuana are considered drug policy violations and are subject to more severe sanctioning guidelines than alcohol policy violations. Second and third alcohol violations result in apartment living suspensions and disciplinary probations, a warning status that allows students to return to the university if they adhere to certain conditions. However, a first violation for any drug use or possession carries the same consequences. Second and third drug violations result in disciplinary suspensions, which dismiss students from the university until they are placed back on disciplinary probation. 
The SAO’s suggested reform would still prohibit marijuana use for all Georgetown students, but punishments for marijuana use would be less severe than punishments for other drugs such as narcotics, opiates or unauthorized prescriptions. 
The proposal calls on Georgetown to create more equitable solutions to address the criminalization of marginalized communities.
“The Committee believes that Georgetown University, an institution that espouses progressive initiatives and social justice values, must follow suit,” the proposal reads. “Although rescinding the prohibition on marijuana is difficult, the least that Georgetown can do is make the sanctions for marijuana more equitable.”
Marijuana sanctions have had a larger impact on communities of color. Black individuals in America are more than three times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white individuals. 
In addition to disciplinary probation or suspension, students disciplined for marijuana violations also have to complete a certain number of work sanction hours supervised by the university and pay fines ranging from $50 to $150, posing greater consequences for low-income students, according to the SAO proposal. 
During a April 25 GUSA Senate meeting, Senator Leo Rassieur (COL ’22) advocated for the university to increase work sanction wages from $10 per hour to $15 per hour and work to mitigate or eliminate the implementation of disciplinary fines in a resolution that passed unanimously.
“Right now, if you want to work to pay the fine you have to work at $10 per hour which is much lower than the D.C. and Georgetown minimum wages — that’s a particularly big inequity,” Rassieur said during the GUSA meeting.
D.C. legalized the possession of minimal amounts of marijuana in Feb. 2015 following the passage of Initiative 71, a measure to legalize recreational marijuana use, by about 65% of D.C. voters in Nov. 2014. However, the sale of any amount of marijuana or the possession of more than two ounces of marijuana is still illegal under D.C. law. In March, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D-At Large) introduced two different bills that would permit the sale of marijuana in the district, a step towards fully legalizing the drug.
As support for the federal legalization of marijuana grows, it is likely that attitudes toward marijuana will change, even at the university level, according to Shlayen.
“Codes of conduct and laws are going to change,” Shlayen said. “I think it’s probably this broader acceptance of marijuana and this newer perception that it is not as bad of a drug as it was made to seem in the past.”
As a recipient of federal grants and funding, Georgetown is subject to the federal Drug-Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, legislation that requires the university to prohibit the possession, use, manufacturing or distribution of drugs in connection with university activities. Under this legislation, federal law takes priority over local law in determining Georgetown’s policies, according to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson. 
“While the District of Columbia has changed marijuana laws in recent years, possession, use, or distribution of marijuana, including medical marijuana, remains illegal under federal law,” Olsen wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown’s policies and enforcement for both alcohol and drug violations have remained consistent.”
Since the SAO proposal only asks that the university lessen sanctions and not end the prohibition of marijuana on campus, however, the university would still be in compliance with its federal grants, according to Alex Seitel (COL ’23), a SAO member.
“It’s not different from the federal law,” Seitel said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “You would still get a sanction if they found you with marijuana or you were giving it to someone else, it just wouldn’t be to the same extent as another drug.”
Several other federally-funded universities in states where marijuana is decriminalized have independent marijuana policies with sanctions identical or similar to their alcohol policies, including Williams College, Syracuse University and Bates College.
SAO members are hopeful the university will be receptive to the proposals, even if it is not fully accepting of all of the SAO’s current ideas, according to Shlayen.
“I think we can start a conversation about it and be able to discuss the support we’ve been seeing,” Shlayen said.

Georgetown University community members are sending letters to their U.S. representatives to advocate for the return of Austin Tice (SFS ’02), who went missing over eight years ago while working as a freelance journalist in Syria.
Over 1,500 people have requested their representatives sign a letter asking President Joe Biden’s administration to prioritize Tice’s safe return. So far, nearly 600 Georgetown community members have sent letters. The constituent letters, sponsored by Tice’s family and other supporters, have already prompted 80 members of Congress to sign and send a bipartisan open letter addressed to Biden, according to Julie Moos, executive director of the National Press Club Journalism Institute, a nonprofit organization that supports journalists and advocates for independent press. 
“It’s important for the public to keep Austin’s name in front of their Members of Congress, who can ask for briefings on his situation, discuss him during committee meetings, draw attention to his situation on the floor while in session, and let the President know that his return home is important to the Member and their community,” Moos wrote in an email to The Hoya. “They have leverage and influence that they can use to help bring Austin home.”
In 2012, Tice was kidnapped in Syria while working as a freelance reporter covering the Syrian civil war. Five weeks after he disappeared, an anonymous YouTube user posted a video, titled “Austin Tice is Alive,” showing Tice surrounded by unidentified armed men. Tice is believed to be alive, and his case is being pursued by the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, a team of experts based in the FBI headquarters that works to recover American hostages abroad, according to the FBI National Press Office. 
The #FreeAustinTice campaign, organized by the National Press Club Journalism Institute to bring awareness to Tice’s kidnapping and promote his return, provided students with a prewritten message to send to their representatives.
“We are asking you to help once again. This time, we are asking Members of the House and Senate to sign a letter to President Biden reiterating the urgency of finally securing Austin’s return home so that he can reunite with his family immediately,” the letter reads.
Constituent letters are an effective method of pressuring the Biden administration to prioritize pushing for Tice’s release, according to Joel Hellman, dean of the School of Foreign Service.  
“There has been clearly a lot of activity at the White House level, and we think part of that is because of the pressure being put from within Congress and from others,” Hellman said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We will use every opportunity and every lever that we have to keep pushing for his release, and this one I think is an important one.”
In February, just days into the Biden administration, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with the families of Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. The Biden administration will continue to negotiate on behalf of all U.S. citizens who are being held as hostages, a U.S. Department of State spokesperson wrote in a Feb. 9 email to The Hoya. 
Tice and community members who have demonstrated support for Tice’s safe return embody and exemplify service, one of the SFS’s core values, according to Hellman.
“We feel especially obligated to keep keeping the pressure up for Austin Tice’s return because we think it’s partly the values from the SFS that led Austin to do what he did,” Hellman said. “I think that says a lot about him, and the fact that the community has continued to raise their voice in support of him shows that we feel this is a set of values that are very important to defend.”
Sending constituent letters is another method for the Georgetown community to advocate for Tice’s safe return, according to Doyle McManus, director of Georgetown’s journalism program.
“It seems to me this is a very useful way to reraise the profile of this case and to let the White House know that there are lots of constituencies out there that care deeply about Austin Tice,” McManus said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
Beyond the recent letters, the Georgetown community has been active in the #FreeAustinTice campaign, advocating for Tice’s safe return on social media, launching petitions and participating in peaceful demonstrations since 2015.
In 2019, the SFS honored Tice as a Centennial Honoree, an award presented to SFS graduates who have embodied Jesuit values throughout their lives. Tice was recognized for his commitment to and motivation for understanding the world and sharing the truth, according to an April 13 email from Hellman to SFS undergraduates.
“In going to Syria, his mission was to bring to others an understanding of the world. His motivation was to serve those who could not tell their stories,” the email reads. “And he was willing to do it all at great personal risk.”
According to McManus, continued advocacy for Tice’s safety is an obligation owed to journalists who take risks to keep audiences informed.
“When reporters and journalists are under attack, then reporters and journalists have to speak up for them,” McManus said. “This is a case where journalists have grown to see it not only as justified but as a moral imperative.”

Georgetown University collaborated with Washington, D.C. officials to organize a vaccination clinic April 25, administering second doses of the Moderna shot to eligible D.C. residents. 
The temporary clinic was held in the Entertainment and Sports Arena in D.C.’s Ward 8, hosting dozens of clinical volunteers. Medical and nursing students, as well as additional volunteers from the university, helped administer the vaccine and direct guests to the correct locations.
The clinic was an excellent opportunity for volunteers to be involved in important public health work, according to Ricardo Rendon Cepeda (GRD ’21), an on-site non-medical assistant at Sunday’s clinic.
“It was very nice to help and see so many people getting vaccinated,” Cepeda said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “All of us who volunteered were very passionate about it and the organizers did a fantastic job.”
With availability opening up, Georgetown students living in the area are eager to get vaccinated, according to Grace Bianco (COL ’24).
“Everyone is rushing to try and get it now, and it seems to be going quickly,” Bianco said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “A lot of my friends say it is really easy to sign up now.”
This clinic marks the third time Georgetown partnered with the city to vaccinate D.C. residents. The previous clinics also took place at the arena, as its large capacity allows for the smooth flow of traffic, according to Cepeda. “The arena lent itself very well because it was very spacious, and it was clear where to go from one station to the next, Cepeda said.
So far, the District has administered almost 500,000 doses of the vaccine, with numbers climbing each day. Beginning May 1, the city will transition to the use of 11 high-capacity clinics, where residents can get vaccinated without an appointment. 
The District has maintained one of the lowest infection rates in the country throughout the pandemic. Cooperation of the community has been crucial to keeping cases low, according to Mayor Muriel Bowser (D).
“D.C. residents, thank you for all that you’re doing to adhere to health guidance and to get vaccinated because it is making a difference,” Bowser said in a press conference Monday. “The way we get open is to crush the virus and to get people vaccinated.”
The rise in vaccine availability signals a long-awaited return to normalcy, according to Bianco.
“I was really excited when I first heard I was able to get the dose,” Bianco said. “When I went, it was very crowded. It was an atmosphere of excitement.”
Volunteers and patients alike felt a sense of excitement in the clinic, signaling a sense of hope as vaccination numbers rise, according to Cepeda. 
“People showed up and were very happy to get their second dose,” he said. “There was a feeling of completion.”

For travelers to and from Washington, D.C., future flights might gain a little extra sparkle. That is the hope, at least, of a Georgetown University student who launched an online petition to rename Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport after “Dance Moms” personality and teen sensation JoJo Siwa. 
The change.org petition, created by Georgetown student Dylan Long (SFS ’24), has garnered over 5,000 signatures since it was first posted last week. The page features a colorful photo of the teen singer and dancer followed by a short petition description related to Ronald Reagan, which reads, “Why on earth is there an airport named after this war criminal.”
Given her status as a popular figure in the LGBTQ+ community, Siwa is a good choice for renaming, according to Long. 
“I really did not put too much thought into who it was, but my reasoning for picking JoJo Siwa was related to the fact that Reagan in his presidency did a lot of really terrible things with regard to the LGBTQ communities, specifically with the HIV and AIDS pandemic,” Long said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I decided to pick JoJo Siwa because she’s been this recent rise as a new LGBT figure.”
Siwa did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.
Airport officials do not have jurisdiction over a name change, according to Christina Saull, a spokesperson for Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. 
“Since Reagan National Airport is owned by the federal government, any change to the name would be done by Congress,” Saull wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The Reagan administration has been criticized for failing to prioritize HIV/AIDS research, enacting budget cuts to major health organizations during the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and making joking comments regarding the condition. The airport was named after Reagan in 1998, a divisive move at the time. 
Other signers of the petition expressed support for the name change on the webpage. 
“I don’t know who JoJo Siwa is,” one signee wrote, “but I know she didn’t fire 11,000 striking air traffic controllers.” 
The comment referenced the 1981 strike by the Professional Air Traffic Controllers union over wage disputes. Reagan took to TV, calling the strike illegal, and stated workers who did not return to work within 48 hours would be fired. When the 48 hours had passed, 11,000 workers were fired. 
Long said the petition has gained a surprising amount of attention so far. 
“I was messing around and just decided to create a petition,” Long said. “Within the next few days, it kind of just erupted. I was not expecting it whatsoever.”
Commenters on the petition praised Siwa, for being a positive role model for kids. Multiple signers vouched for Siwa as a better choice for the airport’s namesake. 
“JoJo Siwa is a positive icon to people of all ages, especially LGBTQ+ youth,” a comment wrote on the petition. 
“JoJo Siwa is a gay icon and Ronald Reagan is ugly,” another commenter wrote. 
The petition may serve as a small step in creating more awareness of Reagan’s discriminatory policies, according to Long. 
“If people are not super okay with JoJo Siwa as the new name, I am okay with that,” Long said. “I just really hope to get people talking about making some sort of change to the airport name just to get Reagan’s name off of it.”
This article was updated to include a response from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.

Wow. So this is what a $60k/yr Georgetown “education” amounts to, nowadays, huh?
Pathetic.
Just imagine what this uneducated social justice simpleton would do if he were to find out that the founders of his own university used the mass sale of almost 300 slaves in order to fund his “institution of higher learning”.

This is an incredibly biased article in that it fails to mention any of President Reagan’s positive accomplishments while in office and/or his popularity with a majority of the American public to date (both of which go a long way to explaining why the airport was named after him in the first place).     The student who wrote this needs to do better if she wants to be an ethical journalist some day.

Jim Pagels (GRD ’19), 29, died while cycling in Washington, D.C., following a five-car chain-reaction crash April 9. 
Pagels, originally from Dallas, Texas, graduated from Georgetown University with a master’s degree in mathematics and statistics. He was enrolled in his second year of a doctoral program in economics at the University of Michigan, completing coursework virtually from D.C. at the time of his death. 
Just hours before the accident, Pagels tweeted about his experience biking through a traffic circle to receive his COVID-19 vaccination. 
“Had to bike through a roundabout over a highway to get my Covid jab. Lifespan maximization function is clearly perfectly well-calibrated,” he wrote. 
Pagels had a passion for learning in all aspects of his life, according to Ken Shaw, former director of Georgetown’s graduate program in mathematics and statistics, who recruited Pagels to Georgetown in 2016.  
“Jim was a brilliant and happy person who seemed to be interested in more or less everything,” Shaw wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He always seemed happy and excited about something or other. I liked the way he became animated about whatever was on his fertile mind at the time.”
Despite his undergraduate background in English and American studies at Columbia University and his interest in sports journalism, Pagels set out to pursue economics in 2016, which he wrote about in an October 2020 tweet. 
“After reaching out to every math graduate program in the D.C. area that was offered part-time in the evenings after work, only one, Georgetown, was willing to even entertain the possibility of someone as profoundly unqualified as me being admitted to their program,” Pagels wrote in another tweet last October. “However, they were still incredibly wary of admitting a guy who hadn’t taken a math class since sophomore year of high school.”
Even though Pagels was a latecomer to the field, he remained eager to learn and enthusiastic about his studies, according to professor of statistics Mark Meyer, who taught Pagels in Bayesian Statistics.
“He had this idea in mind. He really wanted to look at economic modeling, housing affordability, and really wanted to use his newly found mathematical statistical knowledge and study that,” Meyer said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
During his time at Georgetown, Pagels applied his interest in economics and mathematics beyond the classroom. As a graduate student, he completed a fellowship as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the main governing body of the Federal Reserve system, which oversees monetary policy in the United States. 
In addition to his academic pursuits, Pagels was passionate about tennis, urbanism and board games. He also worked as a freelance sports journalist and frequently wrote on his personal website about topics that range from maximizing property values in Monopoly to fixing fantasy football scoring using statistical methods. 
Pagels’ passion for learning was infectious and inspired many, according to Selina Carter (GRD ’19), Pagels’ former classmate and fellow teaching assistant.  
“He is someone I thought of as a peer and someone who I looked up to because he had recently applied and had started a Ph.D. program,” Carter said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It came as a huge shock that suddenly he’s gone. It kind of woke me up to how lucky I am just to be able to do the things I want to do.”
Pagels’ dedication to his studies remains memorable, according to Meyer, who still uses Pagels’ final project on the application of logistic regression models to 2016 voter data as an exemplar for current students. 
“After I found out he had passed, one of the things that came to mind is I have not had a lot of students like Jim who would really want to stop by my office and talk,” Meyer said. “I just realized how lucky I was to have had him as a student and to have had him as a TA.”

The U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation April 22 that would grant Washington, D.C., statehood.
H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, was passed in a 216-208 vote. The bill, however, needs support from 60 senators to advance past the filibuster. Democrats currently have the majority in the Senate with 50 senators and Vice President Kamala Harris, who could cast a tiebreaker vote. 
The current Democratic majority in both chambers of Congress is an opportunity for action, according to Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.). 
“Now that I’m in the majority, the first thing I’ve done is to get the D.C. statehood bill passed, and, in fact, we now have the majority in the Senate and the presidency,” Norton said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I’m trying to make hay while the sun shines.” 
Norton introduced H.R. 51 to the 117th Congress on Jan. 4. Norton has advocated for D.C. statehood since the first time such a bill went to the House in 1993. 
The Biden administration formally backed H.R. 51 on April 20. The more than 700,000 people in D.C. should have equal representation in the U.S. democracy, according to a statement from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.
“Washington, D.C. has a robust economy, a rich culture, and a diverse population of Americans from all walks of life who are entitled to full and equal participation in our democracy,” the statement reads.
The bill would make the District the nation’s 51st state, renaming it “Douglass Commonwealth” in honor of Frederick Douglass, the notable writer and abolitionist. An area of two square miles including the Capitol and the White House would remain the federal district and would not be a part of the Douglass Commonwealth. 
There is a real possibility D.C. statehood will become reality, according to Norton. 
“I’m feeling very optimistic with the support of the president, a very strong statement of support, which means that we have an extra two strong hands, or I always call many hands, from the White House helping us to get this done,” Norton said. 
Georgetown University, as a part of the D.C. community of elected officials, leaders and residents, is in full support of D.C. statehood and equal voting representation, according to President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95).
“We are thankful for the efforts and advocacy that helped to make this historic vote possible and will continue to support and advocate alongside Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton and our city leaders to achieve full representation for Washington, D.C.,” DeGioia wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Last week’s vote marks the second time the House passed a D.C. statehood bill. In June 2020, the D.C. statehood bill died in the Senate despite House support, since the Senate requires the support of 60 members to move to a vote. The Senate may pose a similar challenge to the 2021 legislation: Support for H.R. 51 is mostly divided along partisan lines and the bill will require some Republican support in the Senate to pass. 
Statehood advocates note D.C. has a larger population than Wyoming or Vermont but lacks congressional voting power. The District also pays more in federal taxes per capita than any state.
In pushing for statehood, D.C. residents are demanding their rights as guaranteed by the Constitution, according to D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D). 
“The issue of taxation without representation was settled more than 200 years ago through the Declaration of Independence, and disenfranchising more than 700,000 taxpaying Americans is wrong no matter our politics or demographics,” Bowser said in a June 26 press release. “Who we elect is our business, and denying us statehood based on who we might send to Congress is both undemocratic and un-American.”
Granting D.C. statehood would also address a variety of other injustices, according to the Georgetown University College Democrats Executive Board. 
“Statehood would resolve inequities in federal funding for disaster relief, give DC residents power over our own city budget, help reform the criminal justice system and empower local rather than federal judges, give DC residents fair voting representation in Congress, and more,” the GUCD Executive Board wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Statehood is long overdue and we call upon all Georgetown students to commit themselves to this exceptionally important cause.”
Constituents from other states can help make D.C. statehood a reality by reaching out to their elected officials, according to Norton.
“Those who live in other states can help a lot by writing their senators and saying, ‘Support D.C. statehood,’” Norton said.

White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain (CAS ’83) and Chief of Staff to the Vice President Harina Flournoy (CAS ’78, LAW ’84) reflected on President Joe Biden’s first 100 days in office and how their Georgetown experiences prepared them to serve as public servants at an April 22 virtual event.
The Zoom event, held in celebration of Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service’s fifth anniversary, featured Klain and Flournoy in their first joint public appearance. In a conversation moderated by GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), the two White House officials paid homage to their Georgetown educations before outlining the most important policy issues the Biden administration has prioritized in its first 100 days, including the COVID-19 pandemic, racial equity and the surge of immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Former President Barack Obama helped introduce the speakers while congratulating the work GU Politics has achieved in the past five years through engaging students with politics.
“Keep the faith, especially the work you’re doing to break through the filters and bubbles to help us come together. Your work couldn’t be more important,” Obama said in a prerecorded video message.
Klain and Flournoy echoed Obama’s remarks, voicing their appreciation for Georgetown and the GU Politics program. As someone who experienced Georgetown life as both an undergraduate and graduate student, Flournoy said she made some of her happiest memories as a Hoya. 
Flournoy said the values she cultivated while at Georgetown played an integral role in shaping her interest in public service and eventual career path.
“It was always the sense that you should lead a purposeful life, that you need to do something that matters. You need to do something that impacts someone other than yourself,” Flournoy said at the event.
When discussing the policy moves of the new administration, Klain and Flournoy touted COVID-19 vaccinations, economic recovery and progress on climate reform as Biden’s main achievements of his first months in office. Biden’s signature accomplishments include vaccinating 200 million Americans as well as signing the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, a stimulus package meant to provide economic relief for families in light of the pandemic.
Bipartisan support for the American Rescue Plan and vaccination efforts are signs of the willingness of both parties to work together in Congress under the Biden administration, according to Klain. 
“The kind of unity of purpose and unity of effort that is involved in that I think is very impressive to see,” Klain said. “We’re also seeing — on a more political level — broad bipartisan support in the country for initiatives that the president and vice president brought forward.”
Issues of racial justice were brought to the forefront of the nation’s attention in the past weeks with the trial and conviction of Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer whose murder of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd, launched global protests for racial justice. Biden and Harris called Floyd’s family following the news of the conviction, and the president referred to systemic racism as “a stain on our nation’s soul,” according to a White House press release following the verdict.
Tackling issues of racial justice is an urgent priority for the nation, according to Flournoy.
“It has to be a whole government approach,” Flournoy said. “The way that the president and vice president spoke to that family, which said so much about them and so much about what they believe this government should be standing for and doing, and I think people hear them, and it makes a difference.”
One area in which the Biden administration has struggled to make inroads is immigration. The U.S.-Mexico border has seen a surge in families trying to enter the United States since Biden took office, and the administration has recently faced backlash for failing to develop a robust plan to help newly arrived immigrants. 
Flournoy said that Vice President Kamala Harris is currently focused on handling the immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border but stressed that the administration would need more time to introduce reforms to the immigraiton process.
“No one who’s studied the history of this region or seen what has happened thinks that this will be a quick fix,” Flournoy said. “Where we think that we can possibly help is by making some changes in those regions by investing in the acute and root causes.”
Looking ahead to the future, Klain said that Biden hopes to further accelerate economic recovery in the wake of the pandemic by lobbying Congress to pass the American Families Plan and American Jobs Plan, which are intended to provide jobs and tax breaks to boost economic growth. Biden also plans to push forward a George Floyd police reform bill and reforms to gun control despite early signs of opposition from moderate Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, according to Klain.
All White House policy staffers recognize that overcoming divisiveness between political parties will be critical to realizing Biden’s agenda, according to Flournoy.
“We’ve gotten tied up by so much that was built to divide us. What we’re trying to get back to is getting away from those things, and this administration has had a big hand in making people see what we can be, what it was at one time and what it can be again,” Flournoy said.
