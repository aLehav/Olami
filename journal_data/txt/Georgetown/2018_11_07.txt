Money from student tuition will fund financial aid, expand mental health resources and improve student housing, university administrators said at the Hoya Roundtable on tuition rate-setting in the Healey Family Student Center Great Room on Nov. 5.
Provost Robert Groves and Chief Operating Officer Geoff Chatas hosted the roundtable in an effort to increase transparency in the tuition rate-setting process. It aimed to address how undergraduate and graduate student tuition rates are decided and how tuition dollars are spent.
Hoya Roundtables enable students and administrators to discuss issues of interest to students including construction projects, housing and transportation for students, according to the Office of the Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer website.
The goal of this year’s tuition roundtable was to educate students about the tuition-setting process and tuition use, according to Groves.
“If this is a successful session for you, you will understand a little bit more about how tuition is set, why the amount of tuition is what it is, what we’re doing to invest in the university, what we’re doing to cut costs, and how the whole machinery works over time,” Groves said.
The tuition-setting process begins in the fall semester when the university gathers information from the community about desires for new initiatives, demand for new student services, the anticipated need for financial aid and administrative costs, according to Groves. The Board of Directors then reviews new budget materials in the winter and in the spring semester, the University decides and announces the tuition plan for the following year.
Georgetown is committed to maintaining undergraduate admissions as need-blind and meeting full need and is one of only about two dozen colleges and universities to do so, Groves said.
“We want to allow the brightest undergraduates to come here, regardless of their ability to pay,” Groves said.
About 40 percent of Georgetown’s undergraduate student body received need-based scholarship aid in the last fiscal year, with the University investing $194 million into financial aid in 2018. More than $200 million annually is planned for fiscal years 2019 through 2021.
A priority for the university in the coming years is to increase its funding for developing sexual assault and mental health support services, according to Todd Olson, vice president for student affairs.
“We have added significant funding and significant new staff positions both in CAPS and in the main campus. We’ve also grown in the Law Center and are now growing in the Medical Center as well,” Olson said. “We’ve also staffed up in a related area in Health Education Services, where they do a lot of work on sexual assault, Title IX, alcohol issues, eating disorders, nutrition and health.”
Amid complaints of mold and outdated facilities, the university will also invest more in renovating and updating buildings, dormitories and classrooms, according to Chatas.
“We have to make a continued effort to invest in the deferred maintenance across all of our facilities in the coming years,” Chatas said.
Administrators attempt to address the needs of students, faculty, administrators, financial affairs, and the Office of Advancement as they set tuition each year, Groves said.
“You can think of this as balancing our desires. All of us have more aspirations to build new programs, to build better facilities, to offer more services for students and faculty,” Groves said. “Our aspirations always exceed our ability to pay for them, so we’re constantly juggling what we want to do to make Georgetown even better than it is and what we can do given our resources.”
In order to improve its programs in a cost-effective way, the university will develop a more long-term budget plan, invest in technology and increase fundraising efforts, according to Groves.
“We’re actually being very robust at looking at all of our costs and making sure that every cost is legitimate and needed and managed appropriately,” Chatas said.

Maintaining a luxury brand requires passion and innovation to deliver an effective customer experience, Alessandro Farmeschi, CEO of Lamborghini Americas said at an event, hosted by Georgetown Retail and Luxury Association, in Lohrfink Auditorium at the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business Tuesday evening.
Farmeschi became CEO of Lamborghini Americas in April of this year. Prior to that, he served as the company’s Chief Operating Officer. Farmeschi has worked in the auto industry since 2001, starting with BMW and moving to Lamborghini in 2006.
Italian businessman Ferruccio Lamborghini founded Lamborghini in 1963 as a luxury sports car company.
Since then, Lamborghini has maintained its status as a luxury sports car company by adapting to changes in the auto industry, Farmeschi said.
“If you want to maintain your competitive advantage, since things are changing around you, you need to change,” Farmeschi said.
Futuristic designs and advanced technology are at the forefront of the brand’s marketing strategy, Farmeschi said, while showing videos that portrayed Lamborghini’s role as an innovator and pioneer in the sports car industry.
An important aspect of the company is Lamborghini’s tailored service, the Ad Personam program, which allows buyers to customize their car, Farmeschi said. Buyers can work with designers and engineers to perfect how their car looks.
“We offer our clients, who are peculiar, really special products, produced in 20 units, 40 units,” Farmeschi said. “So in terms of luxury, in terms of uniqueness, they basically have no price.”
Lamborghini operates in 49 markets worldwide, which include 145 total Lamborghini dealers. The U.S. market is the largest for the company, which had almost 1,100 sales in the country last year. Japan was second, with around 400 deliveries made in 2017.
Decisions about the company’s present and future come from its base in Sant’Agata Bolognese, Bologna, Italy, Farmeschi said. Sant’Agata Bolognese is a municipality that is part of the “motor valley,” a region in Italy that is home to many luxury car manufacturers, such as Maserati, Ferrari and Ducati, he said.
The location of Lamborghini’s headquarters situates the company in a place of innovation, according to Farmeschi.
“This is where passion is translated into excellence,” Farmeschi said. “Quality and attention to details is an element that makes Lamborghini a great international company despite small volume.”
Lamborghini stands out compared to its competitors because it invests in the future, according to Farmeschi. The company invests more than 10 percent of its revenue in research and development, whereas the industry as a whole invests on average five percent of its revenue in development.
Lamborghini is currently working on a long-term investment project called Terzo Millenio, which aims to improve sports cars’ energy storage capacity, make their engines more sophisticated and reinvent the sound of Lamborghini’s cars.
Lamborghini’s focus on delivering an experience rather than just a commodity will protect the company from new changes in the auto industry such as the advent of ride-share services like Lyft and Uber, Farmeschi said. According to Farmeschi, Lamborghini will persevere because it sells a type of lifestyle and experience that customers desire.
Farmeschi encouraged students to work hard at what they are passionate about to achieve their goals.
“For me, the key is passion,” Farmeschi said. “If you have passion and engagement and push hard to achieve what you want, you will succeed.”

After the Georgetown University Law Center began mandating students to install an essay examination software, students launched a petition asking the university to halt the requirement, raising concerns about the privacy and accessibility of the software on Oct. 9.
The petition, now closed to signatures as of Oct. 23, garnered 595 Law Center students’ signatures. The petition requests that the administration address technical difficulties and other issues related to the software, Exam4, which is used for all take-home and in-class examinations, according to the Law Center Registrar.
When the Law Center announced the new requirement over the summer, Exam4 was incompatible with the latest versions of Windows and macOS. Assistant Dean and Registrar Simone Woung attempted to address the stated concerns with Exam4 in an Oct. 23 email to Law Center students.
“Due to extenuating circumstances, we were required to implement Exam4 sooner than expected in Summer 2018,” Woung wrote in the email. “Unlike our peer schools who use Exam4, Georgetown Law is unique in having exams mid-semester, and the issue of OS updates did not arise during the due diligence process.”
The Student Bar Association, which functions as student government, initially supported the petition. However, after meeting with officials from the registrar’s office, the SBA informed students in an Oct. 24 email that their concerns were sufficiently addressed during the meeting and they currently support the administration’s implementation of Exam4.
Woung expressed confidence that Extegrity, the company which produces Exam4, would release a new, compatible version of the software before exams began. As of Nov. 5, the latest iteration of Exam4 works with macOS and Windows, according to the Exam4 website.
“Two weeks ago the vendor updated the software to work with the latest Mac and PC operating systems, and Law Center officials met with students to discuss additional questions and concerns,” wrote Tanya Weinberg, the director of media relations for the Law Center, in an email to The Hoya. “The meeting was productive, with agreement that many of the key issues had been resolved.”
The Law Center’s decision to move from the previous online examination system to Exam4 was prompted by the university’s discontinuation of internal examination systems, Woung wrote in her email to Law Center students. Woung specified 10 different criteria the Law Center considered when selecting a new examination software; however, none of these criteria included operating system compatibility or student privacy and security issues.
“The Exam4 software is able to access and lock parts of students’ hard drives. It has monitoring functions. There is no documentation on how these functions work or what they can access,” the petition reads. “This is a massive violation of student privacy and may cause issues with students that have data protected by NDAs.”
Woung attempted to reassure students worried about data breaches in her email, saying that Exam4 does not access any non-exam-related data, Extegrity has assured the Law Center that it does not send any student data elsewhere and that the software is bound by the Law Center’s data security requirements and passed security testing in early 2018.

Georgetown University is set to construct a ramp to the entrance of White-Gravenor Hall to increase accessibility to the academic building.
An upcoming renovation initiative aims to make White-Gravenor Hall more accessible by constructing a ramp to the front entrance of the building. The goal of the project is to create a “barrier-free, [Americans with Disabilities Act] accessible entry while meeting best historic preservation practices,” according to a university spokesperson. The project’s design is expected to be completed by early 2019, and construction is set to start in the summer of 2019, the spokesperson said.
The main entrance to White-Gravenor currently requires the use of stairs, which presents challenges for students who use mobility aids. White-Gravenor’s only current ramp is at a far corner of the building and leads into the basement.
Anna Landre (SFS ’21), who is the chair of Georgetown University Student Association’s accessibility team and uses a wheelchair, has experienced difficulty with White-Gravenor’s current layout.
“I’ve had issues with not being able to get into certain club meetings because a lot of times they lock the accessible entrance after hours and they don’t lock the front door — I don’t know why,” Landre said. “And then at night [the accessible entrance is] not very well-lit because it’s not, you know, a well-trafficked area of campus. It’s a place that — you’re only there at night if you need to get into White-Gravenor at night and you have a disability.”
The Old Georgetown Board, a committee of architects appointed by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, an agency that oversees the design of all construction in D.C., granted concept to the project in February 2018 after the university filed for an application with Washington, D.C.’s Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. All proposed projects in the Old Georgetown historic district, which encompasses the entire Georgetown neighborhood, must receive design review from the OGB.
The OGB  approved the permit application at its meeting in November after having previously returned it to the University for design review. The design will now go to the CFA for review at its Nov. 15 meeting before Georgetown can begin construction of the ramp.
The planning for this project required more consideration than the university’s other concurrent projects because of White-Gravenor’s prominent role in the appearance and history of Georgetown’s campus, according to CFA Secretary Thomas Luebke.
“It involves changes to historic building fabric in one of the most sensitive contexts of the university,” he said.
White-Gravenor, built between 1932 and 1933,  has been a prominent feature of Georgetown’s campus since its construction and stands noticeably as one of three collegiate gothic buildings, along with Copley and Healy Halls, at the front of Georgetown’s campus.
Evan Farrara (COL ’19), vice chair of the GUSA accessibility team, addressed these concerns about preserving Georgetown’s history.
“Is the entrance to this historical building what is really historical?” he said. “It needs to be accessible, and the needs of people to actually easily access it outweigh the concern of needing to be historical.”
Student activism and input have been crucial forces in prompting the university to update their accessibility standards and policies, according to Farrara and Landre. Input from students with disabilities and GUSA members was considered in the construction of the ramp, and both Landre and Farrara have helped to advise the university on how best to improve accessibility in White-Gravenor and across campus more generally.
Though she believes Georgetown still has much progress to make, Landre is optimistic about the signal that this latest project sends to students.
“We can’t underestimate the symbolism of something like the front entrance to a building, in terms of inclusion.”

Healy Hall is not a collegiate gothic building. It’s an amalgam if architectural styles, the main one being Flemish Romanesque.

Cheers erupted from Democratic students in the Healey Family Student Center as CNN projected that Democrats would win a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives after hours filled with doubt that the promised blue wave would arrive.
Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service co-hosted a watch party for the 2018 midterm elections with Georgetown University College Democrats and Georgetown University College Republicans in the HFSC on Tuesday night.
There was a strong consensus among pollsters before the polls closed Tuesday — including Quinnipiac University, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight and The New York Times in collaboration with Siena College — that Democrats would gain the 23 seats necessary to take control of the House. Going into Election Day, Republicans held 51 Senate and 241 House seats, and Democrats held 49 Senate and 194 House seats.
After official forecasts came in at 11 p.m. announcing the Democrats’ victory in the House, GUCD Chair Maria Cornell (SFS ’20) said she was excited Democrats prevailed in the face of reported efforts to create structural barriers to voting.
“It’s incredible to see with such rampant voter suppression and just the extent of control that the GOP has had over local and state governments and how they’ve been able to write election laws and gerrymander districts,” Cornell said. “To see us taking so many seats under those conditions and being so close to many other districts that you wouldn’t have even thought of — that’s beyond anything I would have expected for sure.”
Cornell said she was particularly excited about the number of women who won election Tuesday night. At the time of publication, 115 women have won their respective races, 42 of whom are women of color.
“Representation matters,” Cornell said. “It’s not everything, but it matters so much, and being able to change the demographics of the United States Congress is really historic and meaningful.”
Joseph Gomez (SFS ’19), resident director of La Casa Latina, said he was pleased with tonight’s results, despite multiple disappointing outcomes for Democratic hopefuls, including Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s (D-Texas) narrow loss to incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).
“While I’m disappointed about the way the senate race in Texas turned out and the way Florida turned out in general, Democrats have flipped some key house seats which, although expected, is still nice to see,” Gomez wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Several Republican incumbents lost their seats in competitive House elections Tuesday night; however, reactions from conservatives varied, with some acknowledging that this outcome, though undesirable, did not come as a surprise.
GUCR President Jake Lyons (COL ’20) said that he hopes Democrats will use their newfound power in the House responsibly.
“Honestly this has been my expectation, the numbers and states were always in republicans’ favor and I’m very happy we retained control of the senate,” Lyons wrote in a message to The Hoya. “I would hope that the house will hopefully work in the next Congress to form bipartisan, principled compromises that advance the best interest of the American people with the administration – and I fully expect that they do so.”
Other conservative students hoped that a Democrat-controlled House would encourage more cooperation or, at the very least, limit the authority of President Donald Trump.
Donning apparel displaying the GOP’s emblematic elephant, Michael Lundgren (SFS ’22), who had volunteered for Republican Knute Buehler’s campaign for governor of Oregon, said he wanted Republicans to lose the House.
“I’m not a Trump supporter, so I was hoping Democrats would take the House to provide an extra check on the President’s power,” Lundgren said in an interview with The Hoya. “But I was hoping Republicans would hold the Senate.”
AJ Williamson (COL ’21), vice president of Georgetown’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the crowd’s spirits faded in the face of initially discouraging results for Democrats, but that he was relieved Democrats gained momentum as the night progressed.
“The path to get there was a little wonky, but in the end we’re actually pretty much where we expected to be at the start of the night,” Williamson wrote in a message to The Hoya.
Despite strong predictions that Democrats would flip the 23 seats needed to win a majority in the House, hopes of Democratic victories began to diminish as early results from the polls came in around 9 p.m.
Alec Camhi (COL ’20), host of the GU Politics podcast “Fly on the Wall,” though concerned about the Democrats’ performance, said at the time that he still believed that the Democrats would manage to win control of the House.
“It doesn’t look like quite as good of a night for Democrats as I had hoped, but we might still take the House,” Camhi said. “I still think at this point we have a chance there.”
Morale returned to initial levels once results indicated that Democratic hopes of taking the House were not lost, Cornell said.
H*yas For Choice President Angela Maske (NHS ’19), watching from a watch party hosted by HFC, cautioned against only considering the Democratic victory in the House on Tuesday night when determining the party’s success in the midterms.
“It’s important to also realize that a lot of where the key battles on reproductive health care and reproductive justice take place is at the state level, and so we can’t ignore the governors races at all in this, so that’s something we’ll be watching for as well,” Maske said.
