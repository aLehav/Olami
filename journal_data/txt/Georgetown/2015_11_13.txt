Students activists began staging a sit-in outside the office of University President John J. DeGioia today at 9 a.m. to pressure the administration into meeting a series of demands that address racial injustice at Georgetown.
As of press time, around 30 students remain seated outside DeGioia’s office on the second floor of Healy Hall. The activists will continue the sit-in until 12 a.m., and expect to stage daily sit-ins until administrators meet the demands, which include changing the names of Mulledy Hall and McSherry Hall, revising university tours to include information on the history of campus sites, placing plaques on the known unmarked graves of slaves and establishing an annual program focused on education.

DeGioia interacted with the protesters briefly in the morning, and the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation held a meeting at 12:30 p.m. At around 7 p.m. students from American University joined Georgetown students outside DeGioia’s office.
The retention of Mulledy Hall’s name sparked ire earlier this semester and drew attention to former University President Fr. Thomas Mulledy, S.J., who authorized the sale of 272 slaves to a Louisiana plantation in 1838. McSherry is named after former University President Fr. William McSherry, S.J., who served as Mulledy’s lawyer during the sale. Student activists are using the hashtag #BuiltOn272 — the number of slaves sold — on Twitter.

Other demands include creating an endowment for recruiting black professors — equivalent to the net present value of the profit from the 1838 sale — and mandatory training for professors on diversity and identity issues.
Black student activists announced the sit-in yesterday at a demonstration at Red Square, held in solidarity with students of color experiencing racism at the University of Missouri, Yale University and the University of the Western Cape. Multiple other universities, including Syracuse University, Howard University and the University of California, Los Angeles have held similar demonstrations in solidarity with these movements.
At the sit-in, students expressed their frustration with the university administration.
Alejandra Baez (SFS ’16) said the ongoing struggle is important to the black community at Georgetown.
“The black student struggle is my struggle because this community, if we’re not in it to support each other, is not a community. That’s just the opposite of what a community means,” Baez said.
Baez also criticized the retention of Mulledy Hall’s name.
“Personally, I think that naming a building after someone who sold slaves to build up the institution is a disgrace,” Baez said. “How can we build a legacy on an institution that disprivileged a huge portion of our country’s people and that continues to disprivilege students at Georgetown, just in the aftermath of it?”
According to Latazia Carter (COL ’17), a student participating in the sit-in, the movement began before the student demonstrations at Mizzou.
“As a black student at Georgetown, we frequently deal with micro-aggressions everyday. This discussion didn’t just start with Mizzou. … This has been an issue that we’ve been dealing with because, as black students, we don’t feel comfortable with the name of that building,” Carter said.
Carter said she hopes the administration will recognize the community’s demands through the sit-in.
“I don’t want this to seem like a new movement because it’s not. But we’ve had to take this action because the university fails to hear us, and recognize our thoughts on the matter,” Carter said.

LOL. 
I had slaves too, and no one is trying to change the name of my memorial or erase me from history because people feel “uncomfortable”. Slavery is a part of our country’s history and will always be that, history. 
In who’s mind does it make sense to erase a name because it’s reminiscent of slavery, and in the same document demand that information about slavery be included in campus tours? How can a modern discussion of racism in America or on campus take place if these ridiculous arguments about slavery continue to be brought up again and again? 
Changing names is easy, folks, especially in this protected community of GU. Go out there and try to do real change. Stop whining and stark working.

Student-athletes and other members of the university community are calling attention to the unethical business practices of Nike by launching an awareness campaign.
The movement, seeking to put pressure on the department and company’s partnership, marks a turning point in the relationship between Georgetown Athletics and Nike, which began in the 1970s. Currently, the athletics department provides student-athletes with Nike apparel.
The students were motivated by a discussion led by anti-sweatshop activist Jim Keady on Monday, which addressed poor working and living conditions at the company’s factories in Southeast Asia.
After the event, audience members, including student-athletes, participated in a discussion on how to raise awareness about Nike’s practices, which culminated in the formation of an informal student group focused on the issue. The group held its first meeting to discuss strategy Thursday night and will announce its initiatives soon.
Sports Information staff were unable to provide comments from the student-athletes at press time.
On Tuesday, Keady shared a photo on Facebook showing the Nike logo covered with tape on the university-provided sneakers of three Georgetown student-athletes. The picture has received 496 likes and been shared 388 times as of press time.
According to Keady, the tentative goal of the movement is for the Georgetown community to partner with a specific factory or factories and serve as a voice for workers’ rights. He said students need to further increase awareness about the issue on campus as part of the campaign.
“[Students] need to take provocative public action so that they will have the support of the community because the community understands what they’re doing and why they’re doing it,” Keady said.
According to the Student-Athlete Equipment Agreement, to which all student-athletes must adhere upon joining the university, student-athletes are not allowed to alter university-provided apparel.
“Never cut, tape or alter any issued equipment or apparel,” the agreement states. “Any unauthorized altered equipment or apparel will result in a bill to the student-athlete to replace the item.”
Justice and peace studies professor Eli McCarthy worked to bring Keady to campus. McCarthy said that an important aspect of the movement will revolve around how Georgetown, as a community, can work together in solidarity with workers, in light of the university’s relationship with Nike.
“A lot is going to depend on passion of students and their creativity and wisdom,” McCarthy said. “As a school in the nation’s capital and as a Jesuit school with a good reputation for intellectual thinking and social justice, there is definitely potential within the system to broaden this out.”
Nike’s relationship with Georgetown Athletics has come under scrutiny in recent years. An article in The Washington Post from October 2012 detailed the relationship between men’s basketball Head Coach John Thompson III and Nike. Thompson sits on the Nike board and is a friend of Nike CEO Mark Parker.
Jacob Maxmin (COL ’17), the founder of Wearable Justice, a socially conscious clothing company on campus, attended the event Monday. He said he is eager to join the movement and work with student-athletes rallying behind the cause of anti-sweatshop labor.
“I believe that our Jesuit and Catholic identity should be the driving factor for everything we do,” Maxmin said. “I think students are really looking to make a statement, and they want to raise awareness on campus about Nike’s labor practices. This lines up perfectly with Wearable Justice’s mission.”
The Georgetown University Bookstore committed to the anti-sweatshop movement when it began to sell apparel from Alta Gracia, a clothing factory that provides fair wages to workers, in 2014.
Keady said the eagerness he has seen from students is unprecedented.
“The swift and excited response I got from student-athletes on Monday night at Georgetown is very unique,” Keady said. “They are potentially putting their spots on the team or their scholarships in jeopardy. … It takes a tremendous amount of courage, and I am going to support them every step of the way.”
Keady was a graduate assistant soccer coach at St. John’s University in the late 1990s. After Nike approached the team to negotiate a flagship endorsement deal, Keady expressed opposition upon learning about low wages and abuse at Nike factories. The university forced him to resign, and since then, he has worked as an advocate for workers.
In the summer of 2000, Keady lived on workers’ wages with Nike employees at a slum in Indonesia.
“In the time I was there, I met all of these mostly young women workers who made the stuff that as a college athlete and as a coach that I had worn for years,” Keady said. “I had never thought about who they were or what their lives were like. I promised them I would go home, tell their stories and advocate for them.”
Theology professor Kerry Danner-McDonald asked a number of her students to attend Keady’s talk. She emphasized the degree to which the movement against sweatshop labor aligns with the university’s Jesuit mission.
“The Catholic Church has had a consistently strong statement about the economy needing to work for the dignity of the person.” Danner-McDonald said. “We want students to be men and women for others. We talk about faith and justice, and even more so we about ‘ad maiorem Dei gloriam’ or ‘for the greater glory of God.’”
Keady urged students who wish to become involved to educate both themselves and the campus. He said the Jesuit community has a moral responsibility to rally behind students who choose to protest the contract Georgetown has with Nike.
“They should put those coaches in line and let them know that the Jesuit mission and the commitment to developing women and men for others supersedes any contract that Georgetown has with an athletic company.” Keady said. “If young women and men are willing to stand up and be a voice for the voiceless … the full weight of the Jesuit community should be behind those student athletes.”
Clarification: An earlier version of this article stated that the group planned to boycott Nike. Student-athletes have since clarified their goal as raising awareness of Nike’s business practices. The article has been changed from its original title “Calls for Nike Boycott Mount.”

Georgetown fell 19 spots, from 93 to 112, in the 10th Annual Trojan Brand Condoms’ 2015 Sexual Health Report Card, a study that ranked 140 colleges and universities based on the accessibility of sexual health resources and information available to students on campus.
The report card, released Nov. 4, graded schools on services across 11 categories including quality of resources and information, HIV and STI testing, condom and contraceptive availability and sexual assault programs and resources. In 2013, Georgetown ranked 96.
Trojan Brand Condoms partnered with Sperling’s BestPlaces, an independent research company, to conduct its survey. Bert Sperling, the survey’s creator, said the drop indicates a lack of improvement rather than a decline in services.
“It’s not what I would call a significant drop,” Sperling said. “It could be a matter of Georgetown not having really any less services than last year. It could also have a lot to do with how a lot of the schools around it changed their positions.”
Sperling also said the lack of information about both male and female contraceptives online contributed to Georgetown’s low ranking. Currently, the website only lists common first signs of pregnancy and directs students to Health Education Services.
“How to keep from getting pregnant, how to be safe from sexually transmitted illnesses … that kind of information is not available at all,” Sperling said. “If students want that kind of information, they have to look elsewhere.”
Director of Georgetown’s Student Health Center James Marsh said he is surprised by the university’s drop in the ranking.
“We have not changed anything regarding how we offer access to sexual health services,” Marsh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am puzzled as to why we fell in the rankings.”
According to Marsh, the university’s relatively low ranking may be attributed to its religious affiliation.
“As a Catholic institution, we do not offer or discuss abortion services or offer free contraceptive devices, such as condoms,” Marsh wrote.
Maddy Moore (SFS ’17), a member of the Sexual Assault Peer Educator program, said the university’s Catholic identity hinders access to adequate sexual health resources.
“This lack of resources is mitigated by unofficial student groups, such as H*yas for Choice, but the need is not fully addressed,” Moore wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It often seems like the conversations around sexual health are not being addressed on an institutional level through offices and programs.”
H*yas for Choice Events Coordinator Dani Reardon (COL ’18) said that the group faces obstacles in its work to fill the gaps in sexual health resources.
“Because of our lack of resources and funding, we cannot always meet student need,” Reardon wrote in an email to The Hoya. “For example, H*yas for Choice cannot provide birth control and, in general, students are unable to get birth control at Student Health unless they explicitly state they are using it for hormone regulation and not for the purpose of birth control.”
Researchers collected extensive data via student health center representatives, along with follow-up secondary research on those centers and services they provide on campus.
Assistant Director of the Student Health Center Roanna Kessler said that while the Student Health Center at Georgetown does not provide contraception, it does provide certain resources pertaining to sexual health.
“We provide comprehensive screening, testing and treatment for the entire array of sexually transmitted infections,” Kessler wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We also prescribe hormonal contraceptives for medical indications such as irregular periods [and] severe cramps.”
In addition to the services provided by the Student Health Center, HES offers free pregnancy tests and has a special phone line for sexual health questions and pregnancy concerns.
HES Director Carol Day said the program addresses a variety of issues beyond health and pregnancy.
“Our office is also the best first stop for students who are impacted by sexual assault, relationship violence [and stalking],” Day wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Marsh agreed that certain aspects of the Student Health Center could be improved.
“We could examine our approach to sexual health education offered during private office visits to ensure we are offering the most accurate and current information” Marsh wrote. “We could also strengthen our relationship with the department of health education.”
Moore said the addition of programs that address sexual health and healthy relationships could greatly improve the university’s standing.
“We have programs that encourage authentic discussion around sexual violence, but those issues are undoubtedly linked to the collective silencing around consent and what it means to engage in a healthy sexual act,” Moore wrote.
Top ranked schools including Oregon State University, Stanford University, the University of Georgia and the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor boast extensive online resources and a network of student peer groups.
OSU was named the best school in the country for sexual health for the second year in a row, earning perfect scores in nearly every category.
Sperling highlighted the importance of the report card for both students and administration in opening a dialogue about student sexual health.
“It provides documentation for dialogue, a sort of evidence,” Sperling said. “Students have, in the past, gone to their administration and said ‘Look how we’re doing. Why aren’t we doing better than other schools? Why aren’t we getting the information that other people have?’”
Sperling also touted the rankings as a resource for parents interested in learning what resources and information are being offered to their children.
“This is the first time for a lot of students leaving home and it’s great to know that the college is providing this information so students can make the transition into adulthood in the best way possible,” Sperling said.
According to Moore, conservative alumni and outside organizations have pressured the university to avoid providing information and resources surrounding sexual health.
“As a Catholic institution, the university is tied to moral teachings and understandings around sex that might not always prioritize the well-being of students,” Moore wrote. “It’s crucial to understand that our Jesuit messages of cura personalis apply to addressing students’ sexual health decisions.”
Reardon said that the unversity’s religious affiliation is no excuse for its lack of resources.
“While I understand that Georgetown’s Catholic identity is deeply entrenched, it is unhealthy for Georgetown to not be realistic about the sexual health needs of its students,” Reardon wrote.

A D.C. Office of Human Rights report published Nov. 3 found that transgender citizens in Washington, D.C., face significant barriers in seeking employment amid discussions regarding transgender discrimination on campus and at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital.
The data revealed that transgender individuals are less likely to be hired than cisgender individuals. The OHR conducted its research by filing two groups of applications with a variety of D.C. employers, the first with applications perceivably from transgender women and the second perceivably from cisgender women. The first group of applications had more work experience and higher college GPAs. Researchers controlled other perceived differences in ethnic, economic and academic backgrounds.
In 10 of 21 sets of applications, employers contacted at least one or more less-qualified cisgender individuals over more-qualified transgender individuals. Employers tested in the study included universities, groceries, hotels, retail stores and restaurants.
According to OHR Director Monica Palacio, transgender individuals face particular challenges other minority groups do not because of changes in their physical and legal identification.
“They have to go through long difficult medical procedures and sometimes don’t have health insurances to cover this procedure,” Palacio said. “Their legal names change and that can create difficulty.”
In 2011, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for through the collaboration platform. Transgender Equality reported that the unemployment rate for transgender individuals was 14 percent, twice the national level of 7 percent at that time. Unemployment rates of transgender individuals who are Latino, black or of mixed race were 18, 28 and 18 percent, respectively.
Bobbi Strang, a transgender woman who is a member of the D.C. Center for the LGBT Community, said it is common for individuals to go through an extended period of unemployment after gender transition. In her own case, it took more than a year for her to find a new job after transition, even with 10 years of management experience, a master’s degree, fluency in Spanish and a teaching certificate.
Strang recounted an experience where the interviewer suddenly stopped the conversation immediately after she revealed her transition and never followed up.
“[Employment discrimination] is much worse for transpeople that have limited skills and education and experience,” Strang said.
Palacio emphasized how discrimination occurs not only in employment but also in housing, medical benefits and legal protection for partner privileges.
“We are still binary when we think about gender: boy and girl, male and female,” Palacio said. “I don’t think that we are culturally ready to adapt to [gender nonconformity], even though D.C. is one of the most LGBT- friendly [areas] in the United States.”
Even with the OHR’s findings, D.C. provides the nation’s strongest districtwide employment discrimination protection for the LGBT community. The D.C. Human Rights Act explicitly prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in housing, employment, public accommodations and educational institutions.
As of 2015, D.C. joins only 18 states that have statewide legislation outlawing employment discrimination against both gay and transgender individuals. Many states do not provide full protection for both groups. For example, Massachusetts ensures legal protection for all LGBT individuals in employment and housing, but not for transgender individuals in public accommodations.
According to Lexi Dever (COL ’16), a transgender student who works at the LGBTQ Resource Center, Georgetown provides support to LGBT students in the realm of employment. After Dever’s transition, she held four different jobs on campus without experiencing problems.
Transgender students may also request to use a chosen first name in lieu of their legal name through MyAccess.
Dever stressed that it is still difficult for gender nonconforming students to find gender-neutral residences under the current housing policy, which requires that students live only with others of the same gender.
“When you’re the third gender that the university does not recognize, that makes everything much more difficult,” Dever said. “While some people might not find this as discrimination, I do. They definitely inhibit one’s ability to work and live in Georgetown, in D.C., in the U.S. or in the world.”
According to GU Pride President Campbell James (SFS ’17), there have been several incidents this year in which Yates Field House employees removed students from locker rooms based on their perceived gender identity. James also added that there are no gender-neutral restrooms in several older buildings on campus.
“There are always issues in bathrooms and locker rooms where people may not look how others would expect them to,” James said. “So that ends up leading to a lot of discrimination and discomfort.”
In terms of university policy, Dever expressed the belief that increased student engagement and transparency would contribute to future changes for LGBT students.
“[The school needs to ask,] ‘What are your experience as students? How have you struggled or thrived? What is working and not working? What do we need to fix that?’ And [the school should be more] open about the process ongoing,” Dever said.
Transgender patients accused MedStar Georgetown University Hospital of denying treatment to multiple transgender patients in June. One of the patients filed a complaint to the OHR about the hospital’s alleged refusal to treat transgender individuals. The case is still pending.
MedStar Director of Media Relations Marianne Worley maintained that the hospital does not discriminate in an email to The Hoya in June.
“We see and diagnose anyone who presents to us,” Worley wrote. “Quality always drives our decision in determining what is best for patients and we continually evaluate our services and programs to ensure the highest quality outcomes. A gender transition program is very complex requiring an array of specialists with expertise in hormonal therapy, surgery and psychological services, to name just a few. Our conclusion has been that a high quality gender transition service is best delivered in the context of an integrated program rather than in a fragmented manner.”

Several faculty members are collaborating with the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor to develop an undergraduate Labor and Working-Class Studies, which they aim to begin offering in fall 2016.
English professor Sherry Linkon, sociology professor Brian McCabe and John Russo, a visiting researcher at KILWP, are leading the development of the minor. The group initially began considering the curriculum last winter and recently completed the proposal.
The minor will be an interdisciplinary course of study focused on the implications of urbanization on a variety of fields. The minor’s courses will be taught by faculty from fields including sociology, psychology, anthropology, English, history, justice and peace studies, international health and the culture and politics program in the School of Foreign Service.
For the new minor to be implemented, it must first be approved by the Core Curriculum Committee in the Office of the Provost, a group of 13 faculty members from various departments that approves all curriculum proposals. The proposal may also have to be reviewed by the main campus Executive Faculty, a legislative body including representatives from each academic unit of the Main Campus, including department, program, faculty, senate and student representatives.
The KILWP was founded in 2009 to establish projects that explore workers’ rights policies, coalition-building between labor and community groups and student engagement in local advocacy.
Linkon explained that the cluster acts as a foundation for the minor to build upon in structuring its curriculum.
“We’re trying to decide if there will be any specific courses required or if there will be a structure to the kinds of things we want students to do,” Linkon said. “But that cluster helps make clear to us and make clear to our colleagues across campus as this proposal develops that there is a genuine interest and we’re building on a strength that already exists at Georgetown, simply making it more visible and organized.”
Linkon also emphasized the practical components of the curriculum as a chance for students to become more actively engaged in the Washington, D.C., community.
“I think it’ll have a really strong hands-on element that will let students take the experiences they’ve had through things like all the various programs offered through the Center for Social Justice and develop those and make them deeper, make them richer, and do some research but also do their own grant writing and project development and hands-on work in the neighborhoods of D.C.,” Linkon said.
Linkon highlighted the educational benefits participants can gain from the program, which aims to supplement the community work students currently already take part in.
“It’ll provide an opportunity for those who are interested in the problems and challenges that cities present us with, everything from poverty and gentrification to how economic growth happens,” Linkon said. “We’ll really treat this city as a lab and engage our students in trying to address the issues in this city. It will go beyond all of the kinds of volunteer work that students already do in D.C. to ask students to think about how you would solve the problems that this city faces.”
Linkon expressed optimism about the implementation of the minor, but noted that the upcoming administrative approval process for the curriculum may be lengthy.
“It’s a really exciting opportunity, but we also have a long way to go before we’re ready to do it,” Linkon said. “I want people to get excited, but I don’t want people to think that this is going to happen instantly. These things can take some time.”
Hoya Staff Writer Margaret Heftler contributed reporting.
Correction: An earlier version of this article indicated that the professors were establishing a minor in urban studies. While the urban studies minor is currently in development, the professors were speaking in reference to the labor and working class studies minor.
[…] A group of faculty at Georgetown University is developing a “Labor and Working-Class Studies” minor in collaboration with Georgetown’s Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor.  The group is led by sociologist Brian McCabe and by WCSA founders Sherry Linkon, now an English professor at Georgetown, and John Russo, now a visiting researcher at Kalmanovitz.   The minor will be an interdisciplinary course of study drawing on existing Georgetown curricula in the social sciences, English, history, justice and peace studies, international health, and the culture and politics program in the School of Foreign Service.  For more see Georgetown’s student newspaper The Hoya.

The university celebrated Veterans Day with a ceremony featuring speeches from veteran students, faculty and administrators on the integration of veterans into the wider community on White-Gravenor Lawn on Wednesday.
The ceremony also posthumously honored alumnus Charles Rand (MED 1873), who received a Medal of Honor following the Civil War.
The Georgetown University Student Veterans Association and the Office of University President John J. DeGioia organized the event, which included a reception in Riggs Library after the ceremony.
Students in the McDonough Military Association, a group of student veterans in the McDonough School of Business, also led a wreath-laying in Arlington Cemetery on the day.
In his keynote address, GUSVA President James Perkins (GSB ’16) praised how Georgetown paves the way for students to pursue their own paths of service.
“As one of the most elite universities in America, Georgetown is in a unique place where we transform many youth into the future leaders and policymakers,” Perkins said. “Standing here, you will also see how many of us transition into the exercisers of policy.”
Perkins also said the university could do more to better integrate veteran students into the community, calling for more dialogue between the two.
“We simply cannot thank our veterans until we appreciate what they’ve done,” Perkins said. “In order to do so, we need to bridge a gap. I ask all of you to just listen, and embrace the opportunity … to engage and have meaningful interaction with someone from the military.”
At the event GUSVA Undergraduate Liaison Nick Broussard (COL ’17) also agreed that the university community would benefit from improved discourse between student veterans and the rest of the student body.
“I actually view Veterans Day as a catalyst for nonmilitary and military-connected individuals to interact in a way they may not under other circumstances,” Broussard said. “Getting thoughts and ideas in the open, establishing relationships and conversation — all these things can only create a better environment for learning and broaden understanding of our experiences.”
At Georgetown, the Hoya Battalion serves as a Reserve Officers’ Training Corps battalion that has commissioned more than 4,100 officers over the past two centuries. The battalion also includes cadets from five local institutions, including Georgetown, American University and The George Washington University.
Alumnus Lieutenant General David Barno (SFS ’87) also delivered an address on how veterans are distinguished from civilians.
“Call it a spirit or ethic that veterans take from their time in uniform out into their lives, a deep-down belief that animates them to want to continue to serve and keep giving back to the nation,” Barno said.
Following Perkins’ speech, Barno delivered an address on the importance of overcoming elitism among active and former service members.
“I reject that notion that veterans are intrinsically somehow better than our fellow citizens,” Barno said. “Such an elitism, which suggests that somehow [service members] are such a special breed above others … is something I don’t think is right.”
Barno also stressed that returning service members should focus on contributing to the country in a positive way.
“The spirit of selflessness and commitment that our veterans bring with them, from flight deck and operating bases to their churches and homes … is truly what unites all our veterans,” Barno said. “Their spirit is what makes them especially valuable resources for America.”
Chief of Staff to the Office of the President Joe Ferrara received a flag from Lieutenant Colonel Michael Donahue of the Hoya Battalion onstage that symbolized the link between the university community and military service members.
Veterans Office Director LeNaya Hezel, who was involved in planning the ceremony, expressed her respect for the day’s celebration of veterans’ accomplishments.
“Veterans Day, in my view, is about honoring and celebrating those who have made many sacrifices for the sake of our nation,” Hezel said. “Whether it was the ultimate sacrifice, or the sacrifice of being away from their homes and family, it’s important to acknowledge their service and the way they made our country better.”
Navy ROTC member Audrey Fordham (NHS ’18), who attended the ceremony, said it is important to consider the impact veterans can have on wider community discourse.
“I think it’s important for people to see how veterans come back and contribute to the university,” Fordham said. “The more we celebrate their experiences, the more we can learn from their perspectives, and the better a community we can be

The Washington Metro Area Transit Authority board of directors unanimously named Paul J. Wiedefeld the next Metro general manager and chief executive officer Nov. 5.
Wiedefeld, who formerly served as CEO of the Baltimore Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, will replace Interim GM/CEO Jack Requa, who has now served for 10 months after a formal WMATA board vote to officially appoint him Nov. 19.
Additionally, the House of Representatives introduced a bipartisan amendment to approve the Federal Transit Administration’s takeover of the Metro on Oct. 9.
This selection follows former defense and airline products executive Neal Cohen, rumored to be the WMATA’s first choice, leaving negotiations Nov. 2, reportedly due to an unwillingness to undergo public scrutiny.
WMATA board of directors Chairman Mortimer Downey emphasized the board’s support of Wiedefeld’s appointment and expressed the belief that the new leadership will improve Metro operation.
“This Board is very pleased to have a senior executive of Mr. Wiedefeld’s caliber who will help us build a new standard of safety, reliability and financial stability for our system,” Downey said in a Nov. 5 WMATA press release. “The board will continue in our governance and oversight role in a manner that helps Paul succeed in running the day-to-day operations of Metro to better serve our riders, rebuild faith in management and restore credibility with stakeholders.”
The press release also noted that Wiedefeld is declining further comment until after his official appointment next week.
“I am humbled and excited to learn of the Board’s unanimous support, but believe it is inappropriate to comment further until the Board takes its final action at the November 19 meeting,” Wiedefeld said in WMATA’s press release.
According to the Washington City Paper, the Metro’s consumer satisfaction is at its lowest point since 2013, with 82 and 67 percent satisfaction rates for the bus and rail systems, respectively.
Wiedefeld’s leadership comes after other efforts to improve WMATA’s rider satisfaction. WMATA launched Amplify, an online forum for rider feedback, Oct. 15.
WMATA Riders’ Union spokesperson Graham Jenkins expressed hope that Wiedefeld’s appointment will mark the start of a new phase of leadership for the Metro.
“The number one thing is to have some leadership that’s stable and seems permanent,” Jenkins said. “Hopefully he will bring with him a new sweep of leaders and upper-level managers to implement his vision.”
Jenkins cited a number of issues he hopes Wiedefeld will address, including frequency of trains, fares, safety and communication. Midday frequency on weekdays for all rails is 12 minutes.
“At the very least [this] is a waste of this expensive infrastructure,” Jenkins said.
Jenkins said the Riders’ Union would like to see a more reasonably priced monthly pass. Currently, WMATA’s only offer is a rail-only 28-day pass for $237.
Jenkins also highlighted the need to prioritize Metro rider security. Jenkins noted that this would require improved communication between upper management and line-level employees responsible for construction, as well as riders.
“The safety culture is a real thing that the agency should be striving for,” Jenkins said. “Much more informative notices of pending track work, of disruptions, and why we’re being disrupted and what’s being done to prevent future instances of it would be ideal.”

Washington, D.C., Councilmember Vincent Orange’s (D-At Large, LAW ’88) yearlong petition in support of District of Columbia statehood launched July, with policymakers discussing the merits of the petition’s demands during a public hearing in the council’s Committee of the Whole on Oct. 27.
Orange’s petition, “Statehood or Else,” aims to garner one million signatures in support of statehood. Orange will deliver the petition to President Barack Obama and Congress at the Democratic and Republican conventions in July 2016. The current number of signatures is undisclosed.
Orange declined to comment on the petition.
According to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973, any piece of legislation passed by the D.C. Council must undergo a 30-day Congressional review, during which time Congress can prevent the legislation from becoming law. However, Congress has only used this power three times in the past 40 years.
Additionally, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), the District’s nonvoting member of the House of Representatives, is D.C.’s only representation in Congress.
Councilmember Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1) has vocally supported the petition and said the rest of the country is unaware of D.C.’s lack of representation.
“Many residents around the country don’t realize that the 660,000 residents of the District don’t have control over their own budget, that Congress can come in and decide which laws they like and don’t like, and that’s something that no other state has to face,” Nadeau said.
Nadeau is asking all visitors to her office to sign the petition and aims to generate enough awareness and activism around the issue to get legislation regarding statehood passed in the House of Representatives and the Senate.
“The most important part of statehood is that we will be able to fully realize our autonomy, that we will have full representation in the House and Senate, that we will be able to enact our own laws without fear of how Congress will react, and we will be able to set policies that are best for the people of the District of Columbia,” Nadeau said.
Councilmember Elissa Silverman (I-At-Large) said that after years of failed attempts, the movement is gaining traction today because of a more mature government and increased social media engagement.
While registered District voters are most affected by the campaign, residents elsewhere can lobby their representatives to support the bill.
According to Silverman, statehood would affect key issues in D.C. today, such as marijuana legalization, access to family planning resources and budget allocation.
“When you’re talking about family planning and abortion rights, we wouldn’t have disputes with Congress about whether we can use local dollars for that,” Silverman said. “I am fully, enthusiastically in favor of that.”
In November 2014, D.C. voters overwhelmingly approved Initiative 71, which legalized limited possession and cultivation of marijuana for residents 21 and older. However, the legislation brought the issue of D.C.’s lack of autonomy to light.
Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) included a policy rider that said the city could not enact any law that legalizes marijuana in a December 2014 spending bill. Despite these efforts, legalization officially went into effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, Feb. 26, at the end of a 30-day Congressional review period.
Silverman added that she believes college students would benefit from involvement in the statehood campaign and the implications it would have for registering to vote in D.C.
“Georgetown has actually had a reputation for having undergrads who have gotten involved in local politics and have become [Advisory Neighborhood Commission] commissioners and been very influential in campus planning,” Silverman said. “I would say, as a college student, your vote is much more important on the local level than it would be on the federal level.”
According to the District’s Board of Elections’ October report on voter registration statistics, 431,746 of D.C.’s 660,000 residents are registered to vote. Among all 18-24-year-olds in the nation, only 41.2 percent are registered to vote, representing the lowest participation rate among voting-eligible age groups, according to the Census Bureau.
Madeline Taub (COL ’18), who has lived in D.C. her entire life, said it is unfair that D.C. residents who are citizens cannot vote on laws that affect them.
“When I vote I want to be voting for a real representative who can vote on things I believe in, not a shadow representative who can only speak on my behalf,” Taub said. “D.C. citizens are citizens of the United States just like any other American, yet they cannot vote on laws that directly affect how they are run.”
GU College Democrats board member Scott Lowder (COL ’17) said he is surprised that statehood is not a particularly prominent issue in the campus community.
“Georgetown students are very politically engaged, but for a major university in D.C., it is surprising to me that there isn’t more activism around this issue,” Lowder said. “If we wouldn’t accept this status for our own cities and states, we wouldn’t accept it for D.C.”

The Gelardin New Media Center in Lauinger Library began offering the Oculus Rift, a virtual reality software, to students Wednesday.
The Rift, a software developed by technology company Oculus VR, allows users to fully immerse in a virtual reality through its head-mounted display.
Students can sign up on the library website for a 15-minute session with the Rift until Dec. 18. As of press time, the next available slots are on Dec. 2.
Gelardin purchased two Rift headsets for $350 in May using funds donated by the Caroon family. One headset will remain in the library, while the other will be available for checkout by faculty and students.
Gelardin Department Head Beth Marhanka said she advocated for the Rift at Georgetown after trying the program firsthand at the University of Virginia.
“I was blown away,” Marhanka said. “This is something that I want Georgetown students and faculty to experience, to see what they might come up with [and] to see what ideas they might develop.”
There are a variety of programs available on the virtual reality headset, each offering a different experience. Two of these programs, GE Neuro and Titans of Space, have a scientific focus, while the others, such as Doors of Silence, No Limits and Project Cars, are more recreational.
GE Neuro, the world’s first-ever animated virtual reality neuro experience, takes the user on a tour of the human brain. Viewers can explore the mind’s thoughts, ideas, fears and memories. Titans of Space is a guided informational tour of planets and stars shrunk down to one millionth of their actual size.
Doors of Silence is a horror experience in which users attempt to escape a shadowy series of haunted rooms. No Limits takes the viewer on a wild roller-coaster ride, and Project Cars is a popular automobile racing title.
Marhanka said purchasing the Rift is in line with Gelardin’s mission to expose students to different media and inspire experimentation with new technology.
“You might think of some application in your discipline that could change everything, but you have to have those tools available in order to come up with that idea,” Marhanka said.
The ability to realistically mimic reality may prove useful in education. Marhanka said she hopes faculty and students will be inspired by their experiences with the Rift.
“What I hope is that someone comes in and experiences it and says, ‘Wow, I’ve been looking for a way to teach people,’” Marhanka said.
According to Marhanka, other proposed applications for the Rift include making a virtual classroom to train educators and a virtual audience to practice public speaking. There are currently no plans to use it with university courses, although Marhanka said she is open to the possibility.
Moving forward, Marhanka said Gelardin’s next endeavor is to create a “makers’ space,” where faculty and students will be encouraged to make projects with tools that they might not normally have, like 3-D printers and sewing machines. Gelardin installed a 3-D printer in 2014.
Jane Doyle (COL ’18), a student who engaged in a session with the Rift, said her experience with Titans of Space offered an enlightening perspective on the solar system.
“You get a sense of how big things are and the scale of things that you wouldn’t normally get,” Doyle said.
Deja Lindsey (COL ’18), who also participated in a session, said although the software has some flaws, she enjoyed her overall experience with the Rift.
“I think it has a long way to go. … Just in general, it does [need] some work,” Lindsey said. “But for the first round, it was really, really good.”

Five representatives from faith-based nongovernmental organizations stressed the implications of climate change on poverty and justice around the world at a gathering in the Healey Family Student Center on Nov. 9
The second part of the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs’ Symposium on Religion and Climate Change brought together American Jewish World Service President Ruth Messinger, Vice President for Government Relations at the National Association of Evangelicals Galen Carey, Lead for the Faith-Based Initiative at the World Bank Adam Taylor and associate professor of politics at the Catholic University of America Maryann Cusimano Love.
Panelists discussed the efforts each has made in his organization to raise awareness about climate change and aid marginalized groups in the context of their faith traditions.
Katherine Marshall, a senior fellow at the Berkley Center, moderated the discussion. Marshall stressed a strong common interest between social justice, fighting poverty and climate action before segueing into a conversation on the role of religious social justice organizations.
“The world of international development and the world of climate change have many synergies … which include an emphasis on sustainability, and … the challenges of inequality in the world, as well as the challenges of poor governance,” Marshall said. “The anger and grievances are sparking a third pillar, conflict resolution and peace building.”
Carey also emphasized the importance of recognizing the disproportionate effects of climate change.
“Climate change is already impacting the poorest people among us, and we know that climate change will affect all of us,” Carey said. “The poorest suffer most in disasters, which will be intensifying in years to come.”
Carey said since the poor live in the most vulnerable places and have the fewest resources, they are less able to adapt to changing climates and are more prone to displacement by the growth of deserts or the rise of sea levels. Such displacement contributes to the increase of violent conflicts.
Messinger also spoke about her organization’s work in Mexico to secure land and water rights for indigenous populations, who are often exploited by mining and agriculture corporations intent on resource extraction.
“We are supporting groups that are advocating for their land against the incursions of outside interests, helping them become parts of larger social movements that are advocating across countries and continents for the right to food sovereignty,” Messinger said.
Messinger also explained the link between deforestation and health, citing last year’s Ebola virus epidemic as proof that climate change can intensify the spread of deadly disease.
Love then spoke about the obligations Catholics have, as laid out in Pope Francis’ recent encyclical on the environment, “Laudato Si.”
“Francis really talks about the connections between … people, poverty, the planet and peace,” Love said. “He says that it cannot be emphasized enough that these are interconnected and that if we seek only a technical remedy to each, then we are masking the true and deepest problems of the global system.”
After speaking about how financial help through U.S. Agency for Internatinoal Development has helped to provide technical fixes through funding for new farming techniques, Love described the work she has done with Catholic Relief Services in Ghana to determine the detrimental effects climate change has on the poor, particularly in regards to malnutrition as a result of extensive drought and the disenfranchisement of women.
Taylor shared the efforts of the Faith Initiative at the World Bank to revitalize its ties with religious groups around the world to provide funding and research so that nongovernmental organizations can more effectively help disadvantaged groups.
“Climate change poses one of the most quintessential and paradoxical challenges the world faces around the commons itself,” Taylor said. “We wouldn’t be in this conundrum if the crisis of the commons was at the heart of this issue.”
Taylor emphasized the World Bank’s most recent research findings on climate change and poverty, which report that unless concerted effort focuses on resolving humans’ impact on the environment, 100 million more people around the world will be pushed into extreme poverty by 2030. The number of people exposed to severe drought is also predicted to increase from 9 to 17 percent by 2030 and from 50 to 90 percent by 2080. Additionally, a 2-degree rise in temperature could increase the number of people at risk from malaria by 150 million.
Taylor stressed the role of religious leaders in educating their congregations on the responsibility religious individuals have to act on climate change.
“We see peaks in awareness and concerns when major disasters strike, but that concern dissipates far too quickly,” Taylor said. “Religious leaders can help sustain it by putting that in the context of their entire Bible study or engaging churches, mosques and synagogues in a long-term fashion.”

The Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs fined Len Salas and Max E. Salas, the owners of the Dupont Circle house where Georgetown graduate Nina Brekelmans (GRD ’15) died in a fire June 3, $6,000.
The men received three infraction notices of $2,000, charging that the house was not properly licensed.
Both owners have the opportunity to respond to the infractions. If they deny them, DCRA will hold an administrative hearing.
Resident Michael Patrick McLoughlin, 24 years old, a University of Maryland graduate, also died in the fire.
The families of both victims have also filed $10 million unlawful-death lawsuits against the property owners. The families alleged that the Salases failed to properly maintain the property; they claim that faulty smoke detectors, windows that were sealed shut and missing fire escapes made it impossible for Brekelmans and McLoughlin to escape the fire, which was caused by an electrical short.
The suit also claims that the building had faulty wiring, which authorities said caused the fire.
Brekelmans graduated May 2015 with a Master of Arts in Arab Studies. While at Georgetown, Brekelmans ran with the Georgetown Running Club, was treasurer of Georgetown Women in International Affairs and interned at the Muslim Chaplaincy.
