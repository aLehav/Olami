An accident at the chiller plant located between McDonough Gymnasium and Yates Field House resulted in the injury of a worker and power outages in multiple buildings on campus at about 11 a.m Thursday.
University spokeswoman Julie Bataille said that a university worker had fallen off a ladder while doing some work at the plant and hit a power switch as he fell, triggering the outage.
According to Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Services, which arrived on the scene at 10:58 a.m., the worker was immediately transported to the Georgetown University Hospital.
“The patient self-extricated from the area where the electrical incident occurred,” GERMS President Colin Brody (COL ’11) said in a statement.
According to Bataille, the worker did not sustain life-threatening injuries.
Pete Piringer, spokesman for D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services, said that crews were called to the scene of a reported “explosion” at about 11 a.m. Piringer said that the emergency crew found no signs of a fire upon arrival, and the worker had already been taken to Georgetown University Hospital’s emergency room.
The power went out in Lauinger Library, White-Gravenor Hall, Copley Hall, Reiss Science Building, New South Hall, Gaston Hall and Healy Hall at around 10:52 a.m. this morning and was restored shortly before 11:40 a.m., according to University Information Services.
“All power has been restored to the affected locations,” Bataille said. “The university’s [emergency-response] team was notified of the situation and appropriate responders handled the incident. All operations have returned to normal.”
The outage affected several classes that were in session. Chris Halwig (COL ’14) said he was in the midst of a probability and statistics midterm exam when the lights went out in his windowless classroom. Halwig said his professor added 15 extra minutes to the allotted time for the exam once emergency lights activated.
“It was pretty difficult to see my calculator,” he said. “I don’t know if [the professor] would have given us 15 extra minutes if the power hadn’t gone out.”
University workers and Department of Public Safely officials standing in front of the chiller plant, which cools water to effectively decrease the temperature in multiple buildings on campus, declined to comment on the situation once power had been restored.
Workers were also in the process of fixing an electronically retractable door to the plant that had been jammed on one side.
Vice President for University Safety Rocco DelMonaco could not be reached for comment.

The GUSA Endowment Committee heard four more allocation proposals for the $3.4 million left in the Student Activities Fee Endowment on Tuesday, voting to keep talks of performing arts space renovations and a database for community service options on the table.
The most popularly received presentation was the proposal to revamp Riverside Lounge, which many performing groups use as a rehearsal space.
Catherine Razeto (COL ’13), a member of Georgetown’s Irish American Society’s dance group, presented images of the damaged walls in the space and discussed a possible addition of hardwood floors and mirrors.
“It’s a nice big space, it’s just really not up to par for our dance groups,” she said.
Razeto also presented a cost estimate, emphasizing that the renovations would only require 0.6 percent of the endowment. However, commission members said they were reluctant to set aside funds for a space that is already slated for a revival as part of the 2010 Campus Plan’s New South Student Center proposal.
The commission voted not to table the proposal, as the endowment can allocate funds to up to five different projects, according to Committee Chair Andrew Curtis (MSB ’11).
Two other proposals included funding for community service based projects. The committee voted to table a proposal for expanded funding for Alternative Spring Break trips, but said they would consider creation of a service database that would consolidate information from various student groups.
“Many of the groups that presented may fit under the section of an alternative recommendation should the primary recommendation of the committee not work out,” Curtis said.
Emily O’Connor (CED ’14), a student in the School of Continuing Studies, proposed a designated place to serve as a storage and gathering space for students who live off campus.
“We just feel disconnected from the campus,” she said. “It might help us connect with the university and other non-traditional students.”
Melissa Miller (COL ’12), who represents the Performing Arts Advisory Council on the committee, said she thought storage space was a great idea.
“I think lockers would be a huge benefit. I fortunately have access to an office here. I leave the house with eight bags and drop four of them in that office,” she said.
Many committee members said they did not feel that undergraduate funds should be dedicated to non-traditional students and voted to table the proposal.
At next Tuesday’s meeting, presentations will be heard for two highly anticipated proposals, the Healy Pub project and the Social Innovation Public Service fund, which aims to provide seed money to student-led social enterprises.
“I feel like this opportunity may never happen again for Georgetown students to have this much control over where money actually goes. I think this is important because whatever we decide to do, will certainly benefit students for years to come,” Curtis said.

Each year, applicants to Georgetown are asked to check a small box next to the name of one of the undergraduate schools.
They write essays explaining their interest in that specific school: the dream of being the next Secretary of State, a love for the liberal arts, a passion for entrepreneurship and bringing health care to poor regions of the world among them.
But for some, the courses they take in their freshman year inspire them to seek an alternate path.
Hence, they choose to fill out another application, this time an internal one.
In order to transfer to a different undergraduate school, students have to complete an application that consists of an essay explanation of the request, along with an approval from the student’s dean.
Georgetown’s four undergraduate schools receive a majority of their transfer applications in the spring semester as students can only transfer before arriving on the Hilltop or after the completion of the freshman year.
Jessica Ciani-Dausch, an academic counselor for the College, said that many students transfer into the College because they want more freedom in their curriculum or have chosen a different field of study. Students are often apt to select a specific major too early, according to Ciani-Dausch.
“Pretty much all the other schools are specialty schools, so the students came in thinking that’s what they were attracted to, and through their first year they realized either they don’t know or they know it’s not the thing,” she said.
Georgetown College welcomes all students who wish to apply and reviews applications on a case-by-case basis, according to Ciani-Dausch.
“We consider [Georgetown College] as sort of the home-base of the university. We don’t want to turn people away from a good Georgetown experience,” she said.
Internal transfers to Georgetown College have a high acceptance rate, and there are no specific academic requirements as long as students are not on academic probation. Ciani-Dausch declined to provide exact statistics, however.
“There’s the good standing issue, but otherwise we’re going to be pretty lenient in terms of accepting,” Ciani-Dausch said.
The McDonough School of Business accepts about 30 percent of students who wish to transfer into the institution. Nicole M. Houle, associate director in the Undergraduate Program Office of the MSB, said that applicants are required to have a minimum 3.0 grade point average to apply. Students are further evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
“Our acceptance rate depends on space, so it varies each semester. We accept as many students as possible based on the number of seats that are available,” Houle said in an email. Applications to the MSB are rated as more competitive if students have taken business and accounting courses and can transfer credits. Catie Barile (MSB ’13), who transferred from the College to the MSB at the end of her freshman year was notified of her acceptance the summer before returning for her sophomore year.
“I showed interest in the classes the MSB provided, and I had a pretty good GPA. It’s not difficult at all,” Barile said. “I’m glad I transferred — I think it’s a better fit. Since I had already taken some of the core classes the MSB offered, I’m not behind in the curriculum.”
Transferring into the School of Foreign Service is comparable to the MSB’s process. Interested students are encouraged to begin the transfer process early in the fall semester, however, to ensure that they will be able to meet the school’s extensive degree requirements and graduate on time. The SFS was unable to provide internal transfer statistics.
Sara Moufarrij (SFS ’12) initially applied to the NHS but then transferred to the SFS after becoming enamored with international politics in government professor Andrew Bennett’s international relations course her freshman year.
“I always wanted to combine international politics and pre-med,” she said. Assistant Dean in the SFS Kendra Billingslea helped Moufarrij throughout the transfer process, ensuring that she did not overload her schedule.
In pursuing an international politics major along with the pre-med program, Moufarrij said she has discovered the best path for her at Georgetown, adding that any student in the SFS can find a way to combine his or her divergent passions.
“As long as you have enough space in your schedule, you can do it,” Moufarrij said.
Applications to the School of Nursing and Health Studies require more specific criteria than the processes for the other undergraduate schools, according to Marianne Cardillo Lyons, assistant dean for Enrollment Management at the school. The requirements for the NHS depend on each student’s respective program, but the advising staff of the NHS is available to discuss the necessary criteria with potential transfer students.
“Last year, 12 students transferred to us.  This year, we have approximately the same number that have expressed an intent on applying for transfer,” Lyons wrote in an email.
She added that students who transfer earlier are more likely to graduate on time.
“NHS has a strong and comprehensive advising system. Developing an academic plan as early as possible and maintaining open lines of communication are important in helping students achieve their academic goals,” she said.
Nancy Oduro (NHS ’13) transferred from the College into the NHS as a sophomore. Although choosing to study heath care and management was a far cry from what she originally planned to study at Georgetown, she described the process as quite simple.
“They really care about you, and they made the process really easy,” she said.
Oduro purposely chose classes that would strengthen her application and raved about how helpful the NHS deans were throughout the transferring process.
Oduro nevertheless emphasized her satisfaction with her initial experiences in the College as well as her gratitude for the multitude of academic options she has discovered at Georgetown.
“I think a lot of people do use the College as a place to figure out what you want to do,” she said. “I think that’s great. I love the fact that we have all these different schools.”

When Carly Silverwood (MSB ’14) toured Georgetown as a prospective student in the spring of 2010, a dietitian mentioned a gluten-free student group she could join, but by the time she enrolled in the university in the fall, no such group existed.
So, she decided to start her own.
Gluten Free Foodies held its first meeting on Feb. 27 and currently has seven members, according to Silverwood. The group aims to form a supportive community for students who choose to follow a gluten-free diet or who have medical conditions forcing them to do so, as well as advocate for improving gluten-free options from Georgetown University Dining Services.
“Members enjoy one another’s company, eat meals, share information and advice, create recipes, advocate, et cetera” Silverwood wrote in an email. “I know that I would have loved to have this group’s support at the beginning of my freshman year in college.”
According to Silverwood, one in 133 Americans has Celiac disease, an allergy to gluten.
Jillian Ugol (MSB ’12) was diagnosed with the condition the day before she got to Georgetown last fall and faced many challenges living as a college student without gluten.
“Often, I felt like I was battling this thing myself, trying to learn on my own because most of the people around me could not really relate. I cannot begin to tell you how nice it is to meet people that know exactly how I feel and what I go through every day for every meal,” Ugol wrote in an email.
Georgetown offers a gluten-free refrigerator and appliances, according to Silverwood, but Ugol said that every person in Gluten Free Foodies has had at least one allergic reaction from eating at O’Donovan Hall, generally as a result of cross-contamination. The group aims to advocate for improved university facilities as well as a wider gluten-free selection at The Corp’s locations.
Other upcoming events include handing out samples from gluten-free food provider Udi’s at Relay For Life, participating in an effort by nonprofit group 1 in 133 to create the largest ever gluten-free cake to draw the attention of lawmakers and the Food and Drug Administration;  efforts to mandate gluten-free labeling, and attending group dinner outings, according to Silverwood.
Silverwood is currently an intern at Udi’s, an experience that inspired her to form the group. The company offered to provide free food for events if Georgetown had an organized gluten-free group, according to Ugol. A representative from Udi’s is flying into D.C. to distribute the samples at Relay For Life.
Gluten Free Foodies has also been working with the existing student group Gastronomes, according to Silverwood.
Silverwood said that she is optimistic that the group’s size and influence will increase in the future.
“We expect that our group’s numbers will grow as awareness of gluten sensitivity, gluten intolerance and Celiac disease increases,” she wrote. “As our numbers increase, we will have a stronger voice to effect change in the dining hall. By coming together to compile our concerns, we can better work with dining services to implement change.”

The student-led drive for the reform of the Student Activities Commission’s funding guidelines continued in a town hall hosted by the commission Tuesday night.
At the town hall, student leaders reiterated many of the criticisms that they have leveled against SAC during the course of the semester for problems created by the new bulk allocation system. But they also proposed concrete reforms that they would like to see carried out.
SAC announced the town hall after more than two dozen campus groups and student leaders signed two open letters criticizing the bulk allocation system implemented at the beginning of the semester and demanded an opportunity to formally voice their concerns.
Andrew Koenig (COL ’12), chairman of the commission, opened the town hall by emphasizing the importance of student feedback to the allocation process.
“It’s really critical for this model to work,” he said, adding that he understood that the lack of opportunities for feedback when the new system was first put in place was problematic.
The biggest complaint voiced by attendees dealt with the bulk allocation model, which predetermines the amount of overall funding awarded to a group for the semester. Because groups can redistribute the funds they are allocated under this system, some groups redirect funds received for small events towards bigger events. Some group leaders said this system encourages them to schedule more small, casual events than members would typically want.
Emma Green (COL ’12), the treasurer of the Philodemic Society, criticized the system for penalizing groups that attempt to put on ambitious, large scale fundraising events while over-allocating for events like casual members-only dinners.
“Why is it that chairs are less valuable than hamburgers?” Green asked, in reference to Philodemic’s struggle to secure funds to rent chairs for weekly debates. She said that the system imposes value judgments on groups.
“That’s just a failure in your core purpose,” she said.
Koenig acknowledged that the skewed incentives created by the system have become a problem.
“The impact has been that it discourages groups — or at least disincentivizes them — to go for the big stuff,” he said.
Aman Shahi (COL ’13), co-captain of GU Jawani, also criticized SAC for forcing the group to focus on events outside of its core mission. For GU Jawani, a bhangra dance team, securing funding for costumes has become more of a worry despite an increase in funding for low-cost social events.
“SAC is essentially making judgments on what the [priorities] of groups are,” he said.
SAC Commissioner Ruiyong Chen (SFS ’13) said that revamping the incentive structure created by the event type categories would be an important long term goal for the commission.
Eitan Paul (SFS ’12), chairman of the International Relations Club and a leading critic of the new funding guidelines this past semester, was the first student to speak.
After reiterating some of the criticisms of the two open letters, Paul proposed a series of concrete steps that he said SAC could implement to reform the system, saying some could go into effect as early as next fall.
One of his central proposals was that SAC groups be allowed to suggest amendments to the funding guidelines. SAC recently revised their constitution to allow for commissioners to propose amendments that can be voted on during the course of the fiscal year, but Paul believes student groups should be a part of the process.
Paul also said he wanted the opportunity for SAC and the groups its represents to meet next year to plan a long-term complete overhaul of the funding guidelines.
“We think we can make a better system,” he said. “We want to help and engage in the process.”
Students also emphasized suggestions for an ad hoc funding process, the freedom to add events that do not require any funding to their programming schedules during the semester and calls for increased transparency.
While commissioners acknowledged the need for greater communication, they also emphasized that SAC meetings have always been open to the public.
Koenig said he could not commit to a schedule yet but said that the group would consider some reforms that might be feasible for the upcoming semester. He added that he would be open to considering the possibility of SAC groups submitting amendments through their commissioners.
GUSA Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) said he thought that the town hall was an important start to the process.
“It was a great first step,” he said. “Beyond that, you need to actually sit down with clubs.” SAC will begin a preliminary
discussion of how they will incorporate the feedback at their upcoming meeting on Monday.
“This isn’t the end of the conversation,” Koenig said.

If exercise and rest were not enough to mitigate stress, Yale Law School students can now rent a “therapy dog” for 30-minute periods.
According to Blair Kauffman, the law librarian at Yale, there is proof that therapy dogs lead to reduced stress and greater happiness.
Students at these universities greeted the program with enthusiasm.
“[The program] has been very well received by the students,” Jan Conroy, director of public affairs at Yale Law School, said in an email.
A handful of other schools across the country have launched similar programs to Yale’s, including New York University, Tufts University and the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh.
“Research reports lowered heart rates, increased engagement in treatment, lowered depression, decreased anxiety,” Kim Charniak, clinical social worker at University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh, said in an email.
While Georgetown does not currently have a therapy dog, Carol Day, director of Health Education Services, called the rental program a “wonderful idea.” However, she stressed that the introduction of a therapy dog would require a lot of training and paperwork for clearance.
Georgetown students displayed mixed reactions to the idea of having a therapy dog available for rent.
Alexandra Moran (SFS ’13) supported the concept based on her own experience with pets.
“That sounds awesome. I have a dog, so I would use it,” she said.
Others questioned the usefulness of such a dog.
Allen Nawrocki (MED ’14), for one, said he would probably not use a therapy dog.
“I love puppies. I just think it’s weird in a school environment, but other than that it’s pretty cool,” he said.
Rachel Pugh, director of media relations at Georgetown University, said that students can visit Jack the Bulldog for a similar experience.
“While Jack the Bulldog is not here for stress relief, on most days he can be found in the lobby of Wolfington Hall, and students are welcomed to visit Jack there,” she said.
Marc Berardi (MSB ’14) said that Jack the Bulldog is a good substitute for a therapy dog.
“Whenever we get to see Jack around it’s really nice,” he said.

While Obama’s security pinned down the west side of campus Tuesday morning, black SUVs lined Healy Hall for the arrival of Latvian President Valdis Zatlers.
In an intimate speech and question-and-answer session in Riggs Library, Zalters addressed the issues facing Latvia’s role in the transatlantic world.
Along with discussing security, economy and energy, he stressed a common approach with countries to the east of the European Union, as well as with the United States.
“Latvia firmly stands for the same values as our strategic partner the United States of America,” Zatlers said. “By the way, there was a combat unit formed by Latvian-American soldiers in the operation in Afghanistan. It is highest level of trust and partnership with each other. The son of the general said ‘It’s brotherhood.'”
President Zatlers emphasized his commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the EU, making note of his country’s adherence to the democratic ideals espoused by the larger organizations despite Latvia’s modest physical presence in these organizations. He also defended the strength of the euro by citing its sustained public deficit and long-term stability.
Zatlers carefully dealt with Latvia’s relationship with Russia, reminding the audience of the cooperation that resulted from his official visit to Moscow last December, the first of its kind since the Soviet era. During their meeting, Zatlers and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev discussed easing the remaining tension between the countries, caused by factors like the undocumented Russian population living in Latvia.
Latvia is now eager to collaborate more with Russia and the EU, according to Zatlers.
“We have to maintain the intensity of our political dialogue,” he said. “Latvia is ready to be an active member [of the] NATO-Russian dialogue cooperation.”
While the Japanese nuclear crisis was not addressed directly in his speech, Zatlers discussed what Latvia could offer in terms of their nuclear safety policy. The president, who in 1986 helped in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, shed light on the transparency of the crisis in Japan.
“With my expertise being there in Chernobyl I can stand behind the lines of the newspapers,” said Zatlers. “They are managing it in a very good way. It doesn’t mean that the trouble is over, but I think we have to understand what scale problem they are facing.”

Security cameras will be installed at the entrances and exits of all student residences, the Department of Public Safety announced in an email to the Georgetown community on Wednesday.
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh cited continued university efforts to keep safety measures up to date as the reason for this decision.
“Georgetown is installing additional security cameras on campus as part of its ongoing efforts to enhance safety and security,” Pugh wrote in an email. “Georgetown personnel use security cameras as one of many measures to deter and detect criminal activity on campus.”
The placing of the cameras follows a string of property crimes in residence halls and other university buildings. Since the beginning of the school year, DPS has reported more than 123 incidences of theft and 23 burglaries on campus and in the surrounding area.
Caroline Garity (COL ’12) said she hopes that the cameras will help deter criminals.
“I think it could be useful. I got my laptop stolen last year in McCarthy. Increased security would be good for the school right now,” she said.
Olga Alexeeva (MSB ’11) said she thought that Village A’s large number of break-ins in the complex last semester are cause for security cameras.
“I think Village A needs them the most,” she said.
As a matter of convenience, the timing of the camera installation was coordinated to coincide with the setup of wireless in residence halls.
“We are able to create efficiencies in time and construction costs by having work for this project be done at the same time,” Pugh wrote.
In order to maximize the effectiveness of the cameras, Pugh could not disclose where the cameras would be located. She said that they would not compromise students’ privacy, however.
“Cameras are not directed at private residence hall living spaces and are purposefully installed in ways that are consistent with students’ reasonable expectations of privacy,” Pugh wrote.
There are currently cameras located in some buildings on campus, but the devices will be the first to appear in residence halls.
While Lin Chen (SFS ’11) is not concerned about privacy, he said that he is unconvinced of the necessity of cameras.
“I don’t really feel strongly either way. It does seem a little redundant since there are security guards at each of the residences,” Chen said.

In an effort to go beyond coffee-making and catering, The Corp has expanded their philanthropic efforts with two new scholarships for members of the Georgetown community.
On Thursday night, The Corp’s Board of Directors selected the winners of the Kaleidoscope scholarship, which is given to five students who embody the spirit of cura personalis, and the Student Group Scholarships, which recognized the contributions of five campus organizations. Each student or group winner was awarded $500.
“We really wanted to engage students and groups about the Georgetown community and Georgetown experience,” said Tom Lipinsky (MSB ’11), the outgoing chairman of The Corp’s Philanthropy Committee.
The Student Group Scholarship emerged from the board’s desire to continue to reinvest The Corp’s profits in groups that improve and enhance life on the Hilltop.
“Our thought was, what better way to do so than by giving financial thank yous to some of the groups that have made substantial improvements to the Georgetown experience over the past year,” Lipinsky said.
DC Students Speak, One World Youth Movement, the Georgetown Phantoms, WGTB Radio and the Grassroot Hoyas were each recognized for their service.
Several of the groups were recognized for their work in the larger Georgetown community. DC Students Speak was awarded the scholarship to support their plans for a “silent concert” to raise awareness of the new DC noise ordinance, while One World Youth Movement was honored for their work in training undergraduate students to volunteer in D.C. public schools. WGTB, who will use the award to fund their upcoming spring concert, was recognized for their efforts to expand their focus to the greater D.C. community.
The Grassroot Hoyas, a group of student athletes, were awarded the scholarship for their work to raise money for AIDS research, while the Phantoms received the award to help release a new CD of their work for the campus community, Lipinsky said.
The only requisite for winning the Kaleidoscope Scholarship was that the person had really embraced all aspects of the Georgetown experience.
“We played up the idea that each person’s time at Georgetown is unique,” he said, adding that the scholarship committee was not looking to honor specific accomplishments.
The Kaleidoscope Scholarship will be awarded to Emily Durfee (SFS ’11), Ryan Muldoon (COL ’13), Ceyda Erten (SFS ’13), Meghan McCormick (MSB ’11) and Arianna Pattek (SFS ’12).
Lipinsky said that in order to attract the most applicants, the committee decided to cap the Kaleidoscope’s application at one question. The board of directors and four other members of the campus community read the applications and deliberated Thursday night before deciding on the five winners for each scholarship.
Lipinsky said The Corp, which also runs a textbook scholarship for freshmen at the beginning of the year, will announce one more scholarship in April.

In an increasingly social-media savvy world, both doctors and law enforcement officials are warning against the dangers of “Facebook depression” and sexting among teens and young adults.
The term “Facebook depression” is used by doctors’ groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, to refer to the low self-esteem the site may cause in some teenagers.
Gwenn O’Keefe of the American Academy of Pediatrics said that the exaggerated images some teens attempt to portray on the site lead to jealousy and depression among less socially adjusted adolescents, though researchers disagree about whether the site facilitates depression or actually causes it, according to the Associated Press.
Tommy Petriccione (COL ’14) said that he has seen a number of people try to manipulate their images through Facebook.
“There are kids who put up statuses like ‘partying tonight’ just to look cool,” Petriccione said. “One of my Facebook friends is apparently drinking heavily Wednesday to Saturday every week, according to his status updates.”
According to the Associated Press, teenagers lacking self-esteem often feel as if they cannot match up to social standards set by Facebook friends, creating low self-confidence and even depression.
Samuel Streitweiser (COL ’14) said that flamboyant statuses can be misleading.
“Some people like to get attention through these statuses and pictures. I think some people act this way to make themselves feel better,” Streitweiser said.
Jockeying for social position can take a much more sinister tone with malicious cyber-bullying that can result from the competitive social atmosphere. Consequences as severe as suicide have been associated with Facebook bullying, according to the Associated Press.
In addition to Facebook, doctors, prosecutors and educational administrators have put a priority on increasing awareness of sexting, the act of sending lewd photographs, videos or messages by phone or Internet. The media’s acceptance of sexual expression as a social norm convinces teenagers to distribute photos and videos before thinking of the potential consequences, according to The New York Times.
The growing rate of sexting has led to arrests for the possession of child pornography and distribution throughout high schools nationwide, but the social humiliation from viral photographs and videos can also have a negative emotional effect. In one case in Lacey, Wash., chronicled by the Times, a girl who sent out a nude photograph was not charged while the distributors were because the prosecutor believed she had already served her sentence through social humiliation.
Streitweiser agreed that sharing private content via technology could be a risky move.
“Once it’s on the Internet, it stays with you forever,” he said.
However, educators and doctors believe that these trends can be reversed with increased teen awareness of the dangers of social media. Adolescent medical specialist Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin said that the positive aspects of Facebook as a site can be used to socially connect teens, according to the Associated Press. Educators in Lacey and around the country have attempted to begin countering sexting by increasing awareness and addressing the legal consequences of photo distribution, according to the Times.

Property crime has surged in the Georgetown area during the first three months of 2011 relative to the same period last year.
According to the Metropolitan Police Department, property crimes in Ward 2, which includes the university and surrounding neighborhoods, are up 49 percent from last year. Since Jan. 1, Ward 2 has seen 117 cases of burglary — the most common type of crime in the area — and one case of arson. Overall, property crime in the District has increased by 16 percent for the year-to-date.
John Wiebenson, director of operations for the Georgetown Business Improvement District, said that Georgetown has been hit especially hard by office theft and shoplifting.
“It’s more of a snatch-and-grab deal,” he said. “People walk by and see a laptop, and they take it.”
Though Wiebenson said that Georgetown has not experienced as much crime as other areas have, he said the statistics are cause for alarm.
“I think when you look at the numbers there’s always concern,” he said. “I’ve heard some pretty bad stories from other parts of the city,” he said.
Students have felt the effects of this trend as well. The Department of Public Safety reported 42 instances of property crime, including theft, burglary and property destruction, for the first two months of 2011.
Juman Khweis (SFS ’13) said this trend is very concerning.
“I think it’s awful,” Khweis said. “[The statistics] are really startling, and I wonder why it’s happening and what is going to be done
about it.”
DPS officers caution students not to leave property unattended, creating opportunities for thefts.
“For the students at Georgetown, the important thing to take away from this is that nearly all of our property crime involves unattended property,” Associate Director of DPS Joseph Smith wrote in an email. “Students can dramatically reduce property crime on campus by never leaving their valuables unattended in public places, such as their laptops at Lauinger [Library].”
Beyond Georgetown’s gates, the BID is working with law enforcement to inform business owners and residents about the issue.
“Crime in general is really not good and we make every effort to advocate for more coverage. But we also communicate with law enforcement and use some of our resources to prepare our folks as best we can,” Wiebenson said.
Students agree that the best way to avoid becoming a victim of a property crime is to be alert.
“You have to be smart about how you carry yourself,” Khweis said.
Khweis added that she believed his property is safe within the Georgetown community.
“On campus I generally don’t worry. When I need to get up for something I just leave my laptop or my bag and I don’t think anyone will take it,” Khweis said.
Janice Shon (SFS ’11) said that she believes the population of Georgetown is not the source of local crime.
“I would like to think that it’s not people in our community who are committing these crimes,” Shon said.
The original version of this story misidentified Juman Khweis (SFS ’13) as a male.
