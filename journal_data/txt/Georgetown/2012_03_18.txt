Ignite Georgetown, a speaker series to be held this month, hopes to up the intensity of lectures with fast-paced presentations on topics from university history to Batman.
The program brings together 20 students and faculty members who will give five-minute lectures on topics of their choosing. The event is unique, however, in its format — each presentation consists of 20 slides that auto-advance every 15 seconds.
Although Ignite talks are held in more than 100 cities, Georgetown became the first university to hold Ignite talks last spring. Alex Henderson (COL ’12) organized the series last April after attending an Ignite talk in his hometown of Charlotte, N.C.
Henderson said more than 150 people attended the university’s first Ignite event last year, a much higher number than he anticipated. Topics presented ranged from Norse mythology to Ecuadorian gang violence.
Twenty speakers will take the stage again at 8 p.m. on March 21 in Reiss 103 to share their knowledge on a variety of subjects.
Evan Monod (COL ’14), who has cerebral palsy, will talk about the portrayal of disabilities in pop culture.
“I’m very prone to conversation, so being able to condense what I want to say was challenging, but I think it’s rewarding,” Monod said.
Michael Fischer (SFS ’13), a columnist for The Hoya, participated in last spring’s Ignite talks and will lecture on the history of the university this years.
“I feel personally, having been on campus for over three years, that one thing that Georgetown lacks is the opportunity for students to share their passions, particularly their academic passions,” he said.
Other presentations this year will include an overview of the nonprofit organization Invisible Children by Kirsten Harris (SFS ’14), a talk on the history of Batman and the character’s cultural significance by Nick RisCassi (COL ’13) and a discussion about composing and producing hip-hop songs by Tate Tucker (COL ‘14).
The event’s four-person executive board hopes to add another speaker series next fall. Henderson would like to eventually integrate the program with academic departments and student organizations as a platform for presenting the results of research projects or raising awareness about social issues.
“What’s nice about Ignite is that it is essentially a format rather than an organization,” Henderson said. “It’s a forum for conversation that can be used for a wide variety of purposes.”

Two suspects were arrested early Monday morning in Burleith for allegedly burglarizing St. Mary’s Hall. The Metropolitan Police Department is still searching for other suspects and the investigation is ongoing.
According to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, members of the Department of Public Safety’s community action team noticed unknown persons departing St. Mary’s late Sunday night with computer equipment and other items.
The officers, who were wearing plain clothes and in unmarked cars, were on patrol as part of efforts to step up security at the Georgetown University Medical Center. The Med Center has seen eight burglaries since late January.
DPS officers contacted MPD and followed the suspects as they left campus and headed toward a vehicle on 37th Street. One of the suspects was arrested in the vicinity at 11:07 p.m.
A second suspect was detained by DPS officers near the intersection of 38th and T Streets around 11:00 p.m. and arrested when MPD officers arrived on the scene shortly thereafter. MPD officers left the scene around 1:20 a.m.
Working with MPD, DPS searched Burleith for other suspects. An MPD helicopter assisted in the search for about 20 minutes, and some residents said they were told to stay inside and lock their doors.
MPD officers at the scene this morning said that they suspected four individuals were involved in the incident. A public safety alert emailed to the campus community at 1:53 p.m. stated that additional arrests in the case are expected.
According to Kerr, DPS will continue to work closely with MPD on the ongoing investigation.

Georgetown University Student Association President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) were inaugurated Saturday, ushering in a new staff and a new set of initiatives.
The pair chose to maintain a similar cabinet structure to that of their predecessors, but altered some staff positions to better reflect the unique goals of their campaign platform. The roles of Director of Strategic Development and Director of Career Services were replaced with Directors of Social Justice, Academic Affairs and Special Initiatives.
According to Gustafson, these positions are aligned with new projects, such as the creation of an academic research symposium and the implementation of a permanent director for the Center for Social Justice.
Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount also appointed directors to continue many of former President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Vice President Greg Laverriere’s (COL ’12) initiatives.
GUSA Senator Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), the chair of the Finance and Appropriations Committee, will resign from his senate seat to serve as director of student activities fee and endowment implementation.
Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), chair of the Student Activities Commission, will serve as Director of Student Life Report Implementation. According to Appelbaum, fulfilling every recommendation by the end of his term is not a realistic goal, but smaller recommendations can be implemented quickly and publication of the report is as important as its execution.
“It’s about implementing the recommendations but also creating a larger conversation on campus about the importance of student engagement,” he said.
Appelbaum plans to first prioritize the recommendations listed in the report and then delegate them to other members of the executive cabinet. He emphasized centralizing the space reservation system and increasing student access to the administration as important goals.
Gustafson also highlighted the necessity of a single space booking system as advocated by the Student Life Report 2012, listing the initiative as part of her administration’s top three priorities along with the creation of an undergraduate research symposium and finding a permanent director for the Center for Social Justice.
Hiring a permanent CSJ director was a central focus of Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount’s campaign, as the search has stalled over the last two years. One complication that GUSA faces is that the position reports to the Provost, and the search for a replacement for current Provost James O’Donnell, who is leaving at the end of the semester, is ongoing.
Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount also hope to add a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and/or Questioning check box to the CHARMS questionnaire for freshmen.
The GUSA senate approved the staff and cabinet structure unanimously Sunday.
Jake Sticka (COL ’13) was appointed chief of staff. Senator Yupang Chang (MSB ’15) will serve as director of special initiatives, while other cabinet positions will be announced this week.
The finalization of the executive cabinet and staff leaves five senate seat vacancies.
At the inauguration ceremony, Gustafson expressed her excitement about her term.
“Vail and I have an incredible opportunity to really make a meaningful change here at Georgetown and hope that we will serve all of you well in the next year,” she said.
