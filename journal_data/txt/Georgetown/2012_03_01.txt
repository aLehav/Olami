While many local Georgetown businesses are increasingly using LivingSocial as a way of boosting sales, business owners described mixed experiences with the site.
Launched in 2007 by Georgetown alum Tim O’Shaughnessy (MSB ’04) and three others, LivingSocial is a social buying website that offers discounted vouchers for restaurants, movies and other activities.
Most Georgetown businesses that use LivingSocial are small-scale local takeout and delivery restaurants. Avocado Cafe, Wisey’s, Kitchen No. 1 and Wingo’s are among the restaurants that have chosen to place their menus on LivingSocial, often at heavily discounted prices.
According to Joey Chen, owner of Kitchen No. 1, a Chinese restaurant on O Street that offers takeout and delivery, LivingSocial has helped improve business significantly. “We needed more business … and LivingSocial made a positive contribution overall. More and more people have started looking at our great deals on LivingSocial, especially Georgetown students,” Chen said. “It has helped us a lot.”
But across the street at Wingo’s, Assistant Manager Bold Obi said that LivingSocial lacks the customer service and experience provided by online ordering sites such as GrubHub and Campusfood.
“LivingSocial is trying to do too much at once. They are trying to compete with Campusfood, but they haven’t been in the field as long as Campusfood has, so they don’t have as much experience,” Obi said. “To us, the system is too complicated, inconvenient and not user-friendly.”
Several D.C. businesses were upset by LivingSocial’s recent construction of a “pop-up” hosting venue at 918 F St., featuring such events as art classes and temporary restaurants.
“LivingSocial bases its business off of smaller businesses … but now they’re cutting out the merchants,” Michael Clements, chief creative enabler at Dupont Circle’s ArtJamz, said. “We wouldn’t have given them money or helped them build up their demographics if we knew that a year later, they would be our competition.”
But Doug Miller, LivingSocial’s senior vice president for new initiatives, told The Washington Post that the website’s goal is to foster local companies.
“Our space supports area business,” he told The Post in response to the criticism. “It’s really designed as a platform to bring local merchants together with members in a new way to create unique experiences.”

Georgetown Law School faculty and staff took to a different kind of court Wednesday night, facing off against members of Congress in the 25th annual Home Court basketball game.
The charity event, held at Trinity Washington University, pitted the Hoya Lawyas against the Hill’s Angels, which is comprised of members of Congress.
The event’s proceeds will go to the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless, an organization made up of more than 200 attorneys who volunteer their services to help homeless clients.
According to Patricia Fugere, executive director and co-founder of WLCH and a graduate of both Georgetown College and Georgetown Law, proceeds from the game account for between a quarter and a third of the organization’s annual budget.
“I can’t imagine that we would even be here now had we not had the support of Home Court over the years,” she said.
This year’s event raised $941,532.86 for WLCH, more than double the $414,000 raised last year. Most donations come from members of the District’s legal community.
WLCH provides legal services for D.C.’s homeless, helping them gain access to public benefits, shelter and permanent housing. The attorneys also act as advocates for long-term solutions to the issue of homelessness in D.C.
“Tonight’s game is a great opportunity to help provide a voice to those who are voiceless in the legal system,” said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), a member of the Hill’s Angels.
The Angels edged out the Hoya Lawyas to win the game, 50-47.
Laura Donohue, an associate professor of law at Georgetown Law and a member of the HoyaLawyas, has participated in Home Court for three years and said that the game is a way of demonstrating Georgetown’s Jesuit value of service.
“We have this mission of social justice and this game shows how [the students] live that,” she said.
The event also included a silent auction set up in a space adjacent to the basketball court, and spectators this year were treated to a performance by Lawcappella, the Law School’s student a cappella group. Jack the Bulldog also made an appearance.

Two students, Joanna Foote (SFS ’13) and Shea Houlihan (SFS ’13), have advanced to the final round in this year’s competition for the Harry S. Truman Scholarship.
The juniors are two of 191 finalists for the award, which provides students who demonstrate a strong record in public service with $30,000 toward graduate studies. This year, more than 580 students nationwide applied for the award, which was created to honor former President Harry Truman.
Houlihan, who is currently studying politics, philosophy and economics at St. Peter’s College of Oxford University, has always anticipated a career in public service. He believes that his academic focus has made him particularly competitive in the selection process.
“I work in migration studies, which offers ample opportunity to earn scholarship and service experience. Equally important, I received intensive feedback and support from Georgetown’s Office of Fellowships and Awards,” Houlihan wrote in an email.
Foote’s passion lies in immigration law and reform, a field she hopes to study at Stanford University after graduating from Georgetown. She took a leave of absence during the fall of 2011 to advocate for immigrant rights along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Foote originally became interested in applying for a Truman Scholarship after receiving several recommendations from faculty and peers in the Carroll Fellows Initiative.
“They said that the person the program is looking for sounded a lot like me,” she said.
Georgetown has produced 25 Truman Scholars, with the last recipient, Sebastian Johnson (COL ’10), winning in 2009.
The scholarship’s selection committee will ultimately award 60 scholarships after interviewing all of the applicants this month.
“I’d be perfectly happy losing at this point because the application process has taught me so much about myself and my passion for immigration reform,” Foote said. “That is more important to me than winning.”

Members of the local arm of the International Church of Christ, an international group that critics characterize as a cult, have been barred from campus, according to Protestant Chaplaincy Director Rev. Bryant Oskvig.
Oskvig would not specify when the group was barred but said that the organization and a number of other non-affiliated religious groups have been operating on campus in violation of university policies.
Georgetown requires all religious groups that operate on campus to become affiliated with the university, meaning that they must function under the auspices of the Office of Campus Ministry.
“We want these groups to agree to the essential principles and ideals of the university,” Oskvig said.
Georgetown is among several universities that have banned the International Church of Christ, which often recruits members on college campuses.
The university sent a broadcast email to the campus community Tuesday informing students about the presence of such groups. The email, which was signed by Vice President of Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, warned students about the negative influence these groups could exert.
“When engaged with any religious group, no student should feel any undue pressure to join or remain in the ministry or to sacrifice their primary academic commitments or alienate themselves from family and friends,” the email read.
The email also invited students to a discussion event with Jenny Hunter (COL ’93), who joined the ICOC during her senior year at Georgetown but has since separated from the church.
Hunter said that she doesn’t blame the university for her negative experience with the ICOC, but feels that Georgetown needs to make students better aware of its existence and that of groups like it.
“I was 21. I was young. I was naive. I never would have believed that there were these predatory groups on campus,” she said. “Had I been informed that there were groups that you should be very careful about … I think I would have never gotten involved with them.”
Hunter first encountered members of the group at a meeting held at an on-campus apartment. Drawn to the companionship and spirituality she perceived in the church, Hunter began attending daily Bible studies and spending four to five hours each day trying to recruit new members.
“I hate to even think of the number I could put on how many hours I spent with them,”” she said. “”I had been a very good student, very passionate about what I was studying, but that just became secondary.”
Three days after graduating from Georgetown, Hunter moved to California — against her parents’ will — to join the group’s ministry there.
“I threw away everything for this one dream that they had. I was totally willing to do anything for this group,” Hunter said.
During Hunter’s 12 years with the church, its leadership controlled every aspect of her life: whom she could marry, where she could work, whom she could contact.
“I totally, completely bought in to what we were doing,” she said. “I was so under their influence that I thought anything they wanted to do was God’s will.”
In 2004, Hunter left her position in the church’s ministry and cut herself off from the church completely the following year. She divorced her husband and moved to Virginia, where she runs a nonprofit called the Alliance for Cult Recovery and Education.
Drew Bratcher, a reporter for Washingtonian Magazine who wrote a July 2008 feature about Hunter’s experiences, will also speak at the event, which is slated for March 20.
Hunter said she hopes the discussion will prevent other students from having the same experience she did.
“The biggest gift I could ever do for someone is share my sad story, and if I could help any young 21-year-old not walk down the path I went down, then that’s made my 12 years [in the ICOC] worth it,” she said.
