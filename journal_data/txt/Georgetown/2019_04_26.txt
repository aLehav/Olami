Students face new party-hosting regulations and modified definitions of conduct violations ahead of the 19th annual Georgetown Day, at the same time as the Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service has seen an above-average number of calls on the holiday in previous years in comparison to typical days.
For the first time, students were required to register parties for the day a week in advance, and party hosts are required to wear a wristband during the event, according to an email sent to LXR Hall residents April 25. The email states that public intoxication can result in the Metropolitan Police Department administering a 61D Field Arrest Citation, a ticket that leads to an arrest on students’ public records.
Students found breaching the Student Code of Conduct from April 26 to 28 will also not have their violations expunged from their disciplinary record unless they complete an additional 15 work sanction hours on top of regularly assigned sanctions — a change from previous university policy, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill. Regularly assigned sanctions vary based on Residential Judicial Council discretion. 
Failing to comply with university officials is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct, according to an email sent by Provost Robert Groves, Chief Operations Officer Geoff Chatas (CAS ’85) and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson. 
Safety concerns come after an increased number of calls to GERMS on Georgetown Day in recent years. GERMS received approximately five times as many calls on the 2018 Georgetown Day than on an average day, according to GERMS President Brendan Rooney (COL ’20). 
“Last year, GERMS received 15 calls on Georgetown Day,” Rooney wrote in an email. “On a typical day, GERMS receives an average of 2 or 3 calls, with a few more than that on weekend nights.”
Calls to GERMS on Georgetown Day in 2018 also surpassed all other campuswide celebrations, including six calls on St. Patrick’s Day and eight calls during homecoming in 2018, according to Rooney. The group received 15 calls in 2012, 16 in 2013, 15 in 2014, 11 in 2015 and 2016 and 13 in 2017.
University and neighborhood authorities will be active on campus throughout Georgetown Day, including the Student Neighborhood Assistance Program teams, the Georgetown University Police Department, MPD and university officials. 
The Georgetown University Student Association also sponsored a Georgetown Day town hall with administrators April 15. Students were able to submit anonymous comments and questions ahead of time about Georgetown Day for the town hall, which administrators could answer through Google Forms.
Previous regulations failed to deter student misconduct, motivating the implementation of new policies for expunging student records, according to Olson.
“Approach from previous years was not fully effective. Staff are willing to help students who are in trouble,” Olson said in his response to student comments at the town hall. “This is a balancing act and the university is working hard to find that balance.”
Georgetown Day began in 2000 to increase community morale after a series of violent campus incidents, including a student’s death from injuries sustained in an on-campus fight. 
For the 2019 iteration, the Georgetown Program Board organized official Georgetown Day events from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. Such programming has instilled a recommitment to the initial intentions of the event, according to Hunter Estes (SFS ’19), chair of the GPB Georgetown Day Planning Committee. 
“GPB is committed to putting on high quality, low cost events that are open to the entire Georgetown community,” Estes wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have seen a renewed commitment to the original spirit of the day, as we expand the institutional programming that occurs.”
Club-sponsored Georgetown Day events exclude many students from the celebrations, according to former GPB President Zac Schroepfer (MSB ’19), who was not speaking on behalf of GPB. 
“Rather than students splitting off into club-based, or organization based social functions, we could focus attention around centralized programming where every Hoya can participate, regardless of identity affiliation,” Schroepfer wrote in an email to The Hoya.   
Students should attend official GPB programming open to all students in order to promote a more inclusive community, according to Schroepfer. He recommended that club leaders move their events to later in the day so that students can first attend GPB events.
“The goal of asking students to push parties back was the hope that more student leaders, and members of their clubs, would attend the official programming,” Schroepfer wrote. “By creating this shared experience of a centralized Georgetown Day, we can ensure that every Georgetown Student will feel a part of a community of Hoyas, wherever this programming might take place.”
This article was updated April 28 to include GERMS statistic from previous Georgetown Days.

Georgetown University is set to ban the use of tobacco products on campus in August 2020, more than two years after students voted in a student government referendum to create a smoke-free campus. 
Smoking and other tobacco use will be prohibited within Georgetown University owned buildings and grounds, according to an April 25 campuswide email announcing the policy. Prohibited items include all e-cigarettes, according to Charles DeSantis, associate vice president for Benefits, Payroll and Wellness. Juuls and vape both fall under the category of e-cigarettes, according to The New York Times. This policy will apply to all students, faculty, staff and university visitors. 
Smoke Free Georgetown, a student-led group advocating for a smoke-free campus, petitioned the Georgetown University Student Association in October 2016 to hold a studentwide referendum on banning smoking on campus. After three years of advocacy leading up to the referendum in December 2016, the student body voted in support of the tobacco-free movement, with 49.6 percent of the entire student body voting in favor of the ban.
Mac Williams (NHS ’17), a campaign leader for Smoke Free Georgetown, said the administration’s message demonstrated a major improvement in prioritizing campus-wide health. 
“This announcement is a positive step toward transitioning the campus to being smoke and tobacco free, and sends a clear message that Georgetown takes health and wellness seriously,” Williams wrote in a message to The Hoya.  
The 2016 referendum results were intended to inform GUSA’s advocacy to the university and did not mandate university action or policy. Students had not received an update on the ban following the vote until the email from DeSantis on Thursday.
The administration’s response, however, lacks sufficient policy information and has failed to incorporate all of student advocacy suggestions, according to Williams.
“After reading the full statement however, I am left with several unanswered questions, and I hope the university provides greater detail in the very near future,” Williams wrote. “Ending the sale of tobacco products on campus and providing resources and medication for cessation were key pieces of our proposal, and the recent statement does little to provide specific information on these points. I urge the administration to offer more detailed communication.” 
This transition to a smoke- and tobacco-free campus comes after several years of planning by the university, according to the Thursday email. 
Any student with multiple infractions of the smoke- and tobacco-free policy may be considered in violation of the Code of Student Conduct and will be subject to disciplinary action. Repeat violations by any faculty or staff member will be handled through normal university processes, according to the smoke- and tobacco-free policy.
Georgetown will join thousands of smoke-free and tobacco-free colleges and universities nationwide, according to DeSantis. Peer institutions that have implemented similar bans include Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania.
Other locations within Georgetown have transitioned to being tobacco-free over the last 10 years such as MedStar Hospital, the Georgetown University Medical Center and the Georgetown University Law Center, according to the university website. 
In accordance with Washington, D.C. laws, smoking is prohibited in all indoor locations, including residence hall rooms, apartments and townhouses and allowed only in designated outdoor areas, which must be 25 feet away from building entrances to reduce the risk of secondhand smoke. The ban would extend the prohibition on smoking to all other areas of campus beyond those named in D.C. laws.
This new policy may affect the sales of Students of Georgetown, Inc., commonly known as The Corp, as the student-run organization still sells tobacco products in its Hoya Snaxa and Vital Vittles locations.
In recent efforts to reduce tobacco usage on campus, Casey Kozak (NHS ’20), GUSA policy chair for student health, advocated for The Corp to eliminate sales of tobacco products in their storefronts last October.
Kozak attempted to arrange a meeting through a message to the personal email of former Corp CEO Alex Gong (SFS ’20) last October to discuss the organization’s sale of tobacco products. However, The Corp was not planning on ending tobacco product sales as of that time, former Chairman of The Corp Ricardo Mondolfi (SFS ’19) said in an October interview with The Hoya. 
The Corp did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.
GUSA will continue pushing for a healthier campus and supporting the needs of the student body, according to GUSA press executive Harper Thomas (SFS ‘22).
“The Norman-Aleida administration’s first priority is always the well-being of the student body,” Thomas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “GUSA will continue to monitor the roll-out of this new policy and engage in dialogue with the student body to seek out ways of addressing any concerns or challenges that may arise.”
The ban reinforces Georgetown’s commitment to Jesuit values like cura personalis, which calls for individualized attention of the needs of others, according to DeSantis.
“This important initiative forward is an expression of who we are as a University and how we live out one of our most central values: care of the whole person,” DeSantis wrote.
The Office of Faculty and Staff Benefits is also providing comprehensive support to individuals attempting to quit smoking through online links and direction to on-campus resources, according to DeSantis.
“This is a change that may significantly impact many members of our community,” DeSantis wrote. “We hope to create a supportive transition by providing individuals with more than a year’s notice and access to a variety of tobacco and smoking cessation resources.”

The military can counter domestic social injustices and correct foreign policy mistakes by increasing accountability and responsibility within its leadership, former Secretary of Defense and former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) said April 24.
Hagel spoke at a fireside chat, an informal conversation sponsored by the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs and moderated by Cristine Pedersen (SFS ’16, GRD ’20), its graduate editor-in-chief. Hagel spoke highly of the military’s ability to promote American interests in the face of challenging issues, albeit by emphasizing commitment to American values over making brash military decisions.
The U.S. armed forces frequently involves itself in conflicts without considering the nuances of different backgrounds, according to Hagel, who served in the U.S. army infantry in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968.
“We didn’t understand the people,” Hagel said. “We didn’t understand the culture. We didn’t understand the dynamics in play.” 
Hagel identified mistakes in the American foreign policy of previous administrations toward countries like Afghanistan and Iraq, explaining the importance of culturally appropriate diplomacy to avoid unwanted consequences. 
Future alliances in international relations will be as necessary to American foreign policy as they have been in the past, according to Hagel.
“Alliances are critical, if you work with people. That’s why we built the world order we did after World War II,” Hagel said. “We weren’t going to be able to fix every problem and bring everybody to the table and let’s all now agree.”
Before the Trump administration, the military led the way with inclusion of the LGBTQ community, demonstrating that the military has the power to set the precedent for cultural change and acceptance in the future, according to Hagel. 
President Donald Trump announced a ban in July 2017 on transgender people serving in the military. Trump tweeted that there are “tremendous medical costs” associated with services like hormone therapy, sex-reassignment surgery and legal processes involved with transitioning to justify the ban. Amid litigation over the policy in U.S. courts, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the ban to go into effect in January 2019.
To uphold the military’s commitment to American values, politicians must put a greater emphasis on ethics, according to Hagel.
“If you have a leader without character, it’s not going to end well. Character embodies integrity, ethics — not because it’s the law, but because it’s the right thing,” Hagel said. “Unfortunately, in our politics today, I think we have really blown through ethical politics in the U.S.”
The U.S. armed forces is dedicated to respecting the dignity of every individual, which sets an example for the rest of the United States to follow on issues like racism and sexual misconduct, said Hagel.
“You have a job to do in the military, and you’re not confused by that job,” Hagel said. “And you don’t care, if you’re in combat especially, if the people around you are gay, transgender, black, white, Hispanic — not when you’ve gotten bullets coming at you.”
The U.S. armed forces must take initiative in addressing sexual harassment, since reporting has increased beginning in 2013, according to Hagel. From October 2012 through June 2013, reports of sexual harassment in the military increased nearly 50% over the same period a year earlier.
Pedersen experienced sexual harassment while serving in the U.S. Marine Corps as an Arabic translator, which she detailed in The New York Times Magazine. In one instance, an inebriated officer publicly kissed Pedersen on the cheek while she was in uniform. None of her harassers faced repercussions. 
Despite current problems with the military and political polarization, the new generation of political leaders will have a positive effect on the country, according to Hagel.
“I think there are very good people in politics, thank God for that,” Hagel said. “And I think the young generation that’s coming into politics are even better.”

Students will be able to donate unused Flex dollars to help stock the Hoya Hub food pantry this summer through a program co-hosted by Students of Georgetown, Inc., commonly known as The Corp.
Individuals can participate in the Swipe It Forward Flex Donation Drive from April 28 to May 11 at two Corp locations, Vital Vittles and Hoya Snaxa. The drive will allow students to apply their Flex dollars toward purchasing bundles of $5, $10, $20, $50 or $100 associated with a variety of nonperishable food items. 
The Corp will purchase nonperishable food items with the proceeds and donate them to the Hoya Hub, an initiative of the Georgetown University Student Association that launched in October 2018 as an on-campus pantry offering free, nonperishable items to the Georgetown community.
The initiative will enable the Hoya Hub to increase opportunities for individuals on campus to get involved in the program, according to Hoya Hub Co-Chair Julianne Licamele (COL ’21).
“Currently, the Hoya Hub is run by students and was established because of student advocacy,” Licamele wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We thought that this drive would be a great way for us to engage our community and make people feel like they are contributing to a resource that helps their peers.”
The idea for applying Flex dollars in the initiative arose when a student asked the leadership of The Corp and the Hoya Hub whether they could use their additional Flex dollars that they had received as a result of their housing relocation to help the initiative, according to Leila Meymand (COL ’20), director of Hoya Snaxa. Students can also donate to the food drive through other payment methods, including debit dollars.
Earlier this semester, 84 students received $200 Flex dollars each after being relocated from their top-floor apartments in Alumni Square to the Georgetown Hotel and Conference Center because of potential structural issues in the apartment roofs. Students were also upgraded to the All Access 7 meal plan by the university, with the option to to convert the plan entirely into Flex dollars for an approximate worth of $2,950.
The Hoya Hub will likely benefit from the donations of students who have wanted to give back to the community but have been constrained by their finances, according to Meymand.
“I imagine that many students would want to donate to Hoya Hub to support its mission of mitigating the effects of food insecurity, but may be deterred because they do not have the financial means to support the organization,” Meymand wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This new system, though, provides an easy way for those students to give back to members of the Georgetown community.”
In addition to participating in the Swipe It Forward Flex Donation Drive, anyone inside or outside of the Georgetown community can contribute to the Hoya Hub by donating on the university’s website.
The Hoya Hub hopes the drive will bring attention to the fact that the pantry will stay open over the summer and remain functional during all breaks going forward, according to Licamele.
“The drive also cuts down on waste, which the Hoya Hub has been trying to figure out ways to do,” Licamele wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Each semester, flex dollars that could be used on food, expire and do not roll over to the following semester.”
Although this is only the first year of collaboration between the Hoya Hub and The Corp, this initiative serves as the beginning of future service-related partnerships between the two organizations, according to Lille Brown (SFS ’20), philanthropy chair of The Corp.
“We anticipate a great turnout from the entire Georgetown community,” Brown wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As we engage with our Corp motto of students serving students, we are so looking forward to seeing the Swipe It Forward Food Drive come to fruition, and we look forward to growing our partnership with Hoya Hub in the future.”

Multiple Georgetown club sports teams expect obstacles to financial accessibility for students after the Advisory Board for Club Sports saw its funding decreased for the 2019-20 school year.
The budget decrease for ABCS, which supervises the overall administration and policies for the 34 club sports on campus, was approved by the Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriations Committee on March 17. Even though ABCS appealed the original draft budget, FinApp still reduced the group’s requested $309,755 budget by $88,755, granting ABCS $10,000 less than its 2018-19 allotment.
The ABCS budget cuts will most directly affect club athletes who may now confront increased membership fees, which currently average $140 per year, according to ABCS treasurer Eric Diestelow (MSB ’19). 
However, ABCS plans to offer financial support for affected students to remedy this issue, Diestelow said.
“Unfortunately, I believe the funding cut will be felt by individual athletes the most, as ABCS was forced to raise dues for many clubs to cover deficits,” Diestelow wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “Despite these dues increases, ABCS remains committed to financial inclusivity and will again offer dues assistance for any athletes indicating need.”
Some club sports, like Club Rock Climbing, already require significant financial commitment for equipment and participation. Club Rock Climbing members paid $125 in club dues during the 2019 spring semester, a sum that did not cover additional equipment such as harnesses or climbing shoes, according to a Club Rock Climbing email.
The budget cuts could signal even greater costs for students on the team, according to Club Rock Climbing co-captain Rachel Angle (COL ’20).
“The Club Climbing Team was disappointed with cuts to our budget for the 2019-2020 school year. Climbing is a costly sport, and we have been working over the past years to alleviate some of the financial burden for our members,” Angle wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The new budget will hinder our efforts towards reaching our goal of making the sport more accessible to the Georgetown community.”
The recent renovation of Kehoe Field impacted GUSA’s funding decision for ABCS this year, according to GUSA Senator Harry Clow (MSB ’19), ABCS’ liaison to FinApp. The current renovations to Kehoe influenced GUSA to provide increased funds for club teams attempting to find alternative playing spaces for last year’s budget, but the scheduled end of renovations in August 2019 will allow teams to return to the field.
The Georgetown women’s field hockey team plays on Kehoe Field, though numerous club and intramural sports teams also use the space. 
The completion of these renovations and demands from other club boards led to GUSA’s decision to cut funding for ABCS, according to Clow.
“These cuts were made in large part due to Kehoe Field coming back online this coming fall,” Clow wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While I would have loved to see ABCS receive the same level of funding as last year at a minimum, I understand that we are working with limited resources and it is impossible to please everyone.”
Club Hockey has seen an increase in dues from $450 during the 2015-16 academic year to $700 during the 2018-19 year. Club Hockey leadership is also in budget negotiations with ABCS for the 2019-20 year, according to Club Hockey President William Bukowski (COL ’19).
Club Hockey dues have risen, in part, because of the ABCS has not kept up with the growing needs of its teams, according to Bukowski. 
“It feels like club sports has grown massively, creating a need to stretch the same amount of money over more students,” Bukowski wrote. 
The ABCS budget cuts come despite two new club sports teams in the past two years including Club Wrestling and Club Table Tennis and the addition of Club Skiing for the upcoming year, according to Diestelow. Club Fencing also faces uncertainty in the coming weeks as the team continues to negotiate its budget with ABCS, according to Club Fencing Treasurer Mark Massa (SFS ’20).
“We will have to ask for more money ad hoc, and we can’t be sure ABCS will have the funds,” Massa wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While it doesn’t necessarily compromise our operations, it does increase uncertainty and make leadership’s job harder.” 
Club Fencing has transitioned to a new budgeting model in which they receive their budget in a lump sum at the beginning of the year, according to Massa. 
“It does make it harder for club sports teams to adjust spending based off of unexpected needs, membership growth,” Massa wrote.
Other student organizations including Outdoor Education, the Performing Arts Advisory Council and GUSA also saw budget cuts March 17 despite appeals. Outdoor Education received a 43% budget reduction from the group’s initial request. The final performing arts council budget was 33.3% less than originally requested, and GUSA received an allotment 93% less than requested.
ABCS worked to curb the negative impacts of the budget cuts by funding over 70% of all club teams requests instead of cutting funding for any 2019-20 competitions, according to Diestelow. 
“While I was disappointed in the reduction of funding, I understand that FinApp is working with limited funds and must make difficult decisions to meet the needs of many different organizations,” Diestelow wrote. “ABCS went to great lengths to minimize the impact of budget cuts on the teams we oversee.”

Renovations are planned in the next year for both the Reiss Science Building and the Intercultural Center on an unreleased timeline to address structural and functional concerns in the two buildings.
The renovations in Reiss and the ICC mark the first time the Office of Planning and Facilities Management has organized large-scale changes to address facilities concerns in academic buildings this year. Plans to renovate Reiss have existed since at least 2013, when university officials discussed the future of the building at an Old Georgetown Board meeting.
Dean of the School of Foreign Service Joel Hellman held an event in February 2018 on the school’s upcoming centennial in 2020 that included a discussion on improving the ICC. At the event, Hellman said his team has worked with an architectural firm to develop three draft plans for ICC renovations that correspond with different levels of fundraising success for the school’s centennial push, ranging from about $30 million to as much as $150 million.
The Reiss renovations, which are expected to be completed in the next year, will include revamping academic spaces, according to a university spokesperson.
The renovations include a lab for the Georgetown Environment Initiative scheduled to be completed by fall 2019 and a new student study space in the Blommer Science Library area scheduled to be finished by summer 2020, according to the university spokesperson.
In preparation for the intended renovation of Reiss, Blommer, located on the third floor of the building, will close permanently, and its materials will be relocated to Lauinger Library within the next six to 12 months. 
“Planning and Facilities Management is working closely with the Library to ensure the Blommer Library materials are relocated in a safe and secure manner as renovations commence,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The library has suffered from flooding and damaged materials in the past, according to Rebecca Hollister (COL ’21), a student worker in Blommer. Blommer reportedly experienced water issues over winter break because of problems with pipes and cold weather, according to Hollister.
“The periodicals and journals took the biggest hit—a lot of those were absolutely destroyed,” Hollister wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Some of the books were destroyed as well, but we were able to recover a good amount of materials.”
In February 2019, a $75 million maintenance plan to alleviate building maintenance issues was approved by the Georgetown University board of directors. The plan comes after 85 students were relocated from their top-floor apartments in Alumni Square to the Georgetown Hotel and Conference Center over concern relating to potential structural issues in the apartment roofs. 
The deferred maintenance plan aims to improve the conditions of Georgetown’s existing infrastructure and would allocate an additional one-time $50 million attachment, as well as a phased increase in annual spending from $5 to $25 million over the next five years. The funds are set to be allocated to the university’s deferred maintenance budget, which includes projects that repair existing buildings instead of constructing new ones. 
In addition to renovating Reiss, facilities is asking administrators and students for feedback prior to conducting renovations in the ICC, according to an email sent to students April 11. No timeline or details have yet been given, but the renovations are expected to improve the galleria and other common spaces in the ICC, according to the email.
The SFS Academic Council developed plans for short-term ICC renovations in collaboration with the SFS Dean’s Office, the provost’s office, the MUG coffee shop, architects and other independent parties, according to the April 11 email.
“Our goal is to improve the Galleria, the elevator bays, and other common spaces in the ICC, in order to make it a more functional and usable space,” the email said.
Georgetown has experienced an increasing number of housing problems in student residences since the beginning of the 2018-19 academic year. Facilities responded to 361 mold-related work requests in residences between August and October of last year, more than double the number reported during that time frame in 2017, and students in Darnall and Reynolds Halls reported malfunctioning elevators last fall. 
While the renovations of Reiss include two projects that are currently scheduled for completion in fall 2019 and summer 2020, facilities will assess whether sustained renovations will be necessary, according to the university spokesperson.
“Planning and Facilities Management is continuing planned renovations within the Reiss Science Building and will continue evaluating longer-term renovations in conjunction with academic and masterplanning efforts,” the university spokesperson wrote.

A center to promote public health and equal access to health care worldwide announced the appointment of its first directors April 15, as the Georgetown University Medical Center continues to expand its divisions focused on global health.
The Center for Global Health Practice and Impact will aid countries in improving public health while providing Georgetown students opportunities for health research and practice, according to the center’s website. In particular, it will focus on supporting regions facing HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases. 
Dr. Deus Bazira and Head of the Center for Global Health and Quality Dr. Mark Dybul will serve as co-directors of the center, which will expand Dybul’s past work in global health with Georgetown. Bazira is new to Georgetown, having departed from the University of Maryland, Baltimore, where he led a program focused on global health and biosecurity.  
Bazira chose to join Georgetown to lead the center because of the university’s potential to advance the program and its historical connection to social justice, according to Bazira.
“Every person regardless of their individual context and circumstance should enjoy good health and that all of us should work towards creating conditions that make global health equity a reality for all populations,” Bazira wrote. “Georgetown is best positioned to support our center make valuable, lasting and impactful contribution towards achievement of health equity as a noble goal.”
The center, which will work with interdisciplinary schools, faculty and students, will focus its work in supporting marginalized groups, according to Dr. Edward Healton, executive dean of the Georgetown School of Medicine.
“The Center’s programs focus on increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of public health interventions that seek to alleviate major causes of illness for millions of people around the world,” Healton wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The center, which advances GUMC’s work in global health, will involve Georgetown students and faculty from across a broad range of backgrounds in its work, according to an April 15 news release. Georgetown’s location in Washington, D.C., provides a unique opportunity to collaborate with those studying areas like public policy or business. 
“We bring unique experiences and extensive networks in different countries that will allow broader GU community to get more involved in field level work to support the above mission of achieving global health equity,” Bazira wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
These opportunities will include research positions and internships for Georgetown students and students of other academic institutions in countries where the center works. On campus, the center will make its research accessible to students, according to Bazira. 
“Every project we design will as much as possible provide opportunities for learning and research to students at GU with interest in global health,” Bazira wrote. “The data we will generate will be available to students for their individual or team research projects.
The School of Nursing and Health Studies’ department of international health will utilize the research produced by the center in its own work, according to NHS Dean Dr. Patricia Cloonan.
“The capacity that this new center will bring to Georgetown’s work in global health, such as our school’s Department of International Health and other university-wide programs, is exciting,” Cloonan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We look forward to working together with center leadership to [identify] areas of intersection for our faculty and students.”
The center’s opening is a part of a larger Georgetown Global Health Initiative that saw the creation of the Center for Global Health Science and Security, a biosafety and biosecurity program, in May 2018.
The center will continue to develop the mission of the former Center for Global Health and Quality, which launched in 2017 to support countries facing health epidemics in building their own sustainable systems. This expansion will increase the capabilities of both the new center and the Center for Global Health and Quality, according to Healton.
“The work is complementary and collaborative, and Center brings great depth and reach,” Healton wrote.
CORRECTION: This article was updated on April 27 to correct the name of the Center for Global Health Practice and Impact.

Arrested in a New York City hotel on April 11, Georgetown alumnus Mustafa Abdel-Wadood (MBA ’96) faces fraud charges for misappropriating millions of dollars at The Abraaj Group, the largest private equity firm in the Middle East.  
Abdel-Wadood, former Abraaj Group managing partner, pled not guilty, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Griswold (COL ’03) said at a federal court hearing April 11. With his trial currently set for Nov. 4 in New York, Abdel-Wadood sought bail Tuesday according to The National. While Abdel-Wadood is awaiting a decision next Monday over whether he will be allowed to leave southern New York jail, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan said Abdel-Wadood is a “palpable” flight risk.
An Egyptian national with dual citizenship in Malta, Abdel-Wadood and two of his former coworkers, Arif Naqvi and Sev Vettivetpillai face charges of fraud in the United States after a health fund within the company overvalued the company’s investments by more than half a billion dollars, according to Abdel-Wadood’s indictment. Before the private equity fund’s collapse, the $1 billion Growth Markets Health Fund invested in healthcare in emerging economies around the world.
After having earned his BBA from American University in Cairo in 1991 and MBA from Georgetown in 1996, Abdel-Wadood was an executive in the field of investment management, corporate finance and business development throughout the Middle East region. 
Abdel-Wadood’s attorneys did not respond to a request for comment. 
The U.S. case against Abdel-Wadood includes “millions” of documents and computer files, secretly recorded calls and messages and a geolocation tracker placed on his phone, according to Griswold. 
Beyond his involvement in Abraaj, Abdel-Wadood is listed as a speaker at a past event with the City Alliance, a London-based organization for Georgetown alumni in financial services, and the 2016 Georgetown University Africa Business Conference. 
The Growth Markets Health Fund not only invested in healthcare in growing economies but also raised money for U.S.-based philanthropic organizations and investors including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Gates Foundation alone invested $100 million in the fund, while attracting over $900 million of private sector investors, according to a Gates Foundation spokesperson.
The Gates Foundation supported the philanthropic goals of the fund before its end, a Gates Foundation spokesperson said in an interview with The Hoya.
“The fund itself—what it was focused on and what it still is focused on—it was really kind of a new approach for improving healthcare for folks living in Sub-Saharan African and South Asia,” the spokesperson said.
Abdel-Wadood was previously represented by Benjamin Brafman, a well-known criminal defense attorney who represented Sean “P. Diddy” Combs and briefly Harvey Weinstein, but he no longer represents Abdel-Wadood, Brafman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Abraaj’s founder Naqvi was arrested in London’s Heathrow Airport on April 10, and a court hearing to extradite him to the United States was postponed until April 26, according to The New York Times. Former managing partner Vettivetpillai was also arrested in London and faces an extradition request. 
While the McDonough School of Business confirmed Abdel-Wadood was an alumnus, they declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.
Abraaj was founded in 2002 and over the next 16 years became an influential investor in emerging economies. The company held an esteemed position in global development and received the Oslo Business for Peace Award.
Abdel-Wadood joined the firm in June 2006 and departed in March 2018, around the same time that rumors began to swirl about Abraaj’s alleged mismanagement. The firm has since become insolvent and now owes creditors over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg.
Abraaj’s decline is the largest ever private equity insolvency case, according to Arabian Business. Currently, a range of investors are seeking to acquire Abraaj’s various funds in its portfolio, and TPG Capital was in talks to acquire the healthcare fund, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Fostering connections between incarcerated people and the outside world must be a key feature of criminal justice reform, panelists agreed at a discussion on the free speech rights of incarcerated Americans on Tuesday. 
The event, co-sponsored by the Georgetown Prisons and Justice Initiative and Georgetown’s Free Speech Project, was titled “Inside Voices: The Free Speech Rights of Incarcerated Americans” and moderated by Marc Howard, a government professor and the director of the Prisons and Justice Initiative, and Sanford Ungar, director of the Free Speech Project.
Present on the panel was Joel Castón, a participant in Georgetown’s Prison Scholars Program through the Prisons and Justice Initiative. Castón has been incarcerated for nearly 25 years and has been studying under Marc Howard through the Prison Scholars Program.
Dialogue between incarcerated residents and policymakers is crucial in ensuring the rights of those who are detained, Castón told Tuesday’s audience via Skype from the D.C. jail.
“We must be able to know that our voices are not only being heard, but our perspectives are being taken under consideration, and it’s a two-way dialogue that ebbs and flows,” Castón said. “These things right here will help with safety in the prison.”
Castón mentors younger residents in the D.C. Jail through “Young Men Emerging,” a program he founded which pairs inmates typically serving life sentences with incarcerated men between the ages of 18 and 24.
The connections that YME helps create are crucial in making the transition from incarceration to the outside world successful, according to Howard.
“If you are engaged, if you are connected, as he was, as Joel is, you are ready,” Howard said. “If you are separated, if you are cut off, if you have no voice, if you have no opportunity, no technology from society, it’s going to be very, very hard.”
The Prisons and Justice Initiative has seen multiple success stories with its participants recently. Halim Flowers, a participant in the Prison Scholars program and imprisoned at 17, was released early from jail March 21 after 22 years in prison as a result of his personal growth while incarcerated. “Making An Exoneree,” a Georgetown course offered by Howard, has also worked to exonerate wrongfully convicted individuals in the past including Valentino Dixon, who spent 26 years in prison after being found guilty of murder. 
Another member of the panel was Sekwan Merritt, a paralegal for Arnold and Porter who was formerly incarcerated. Merritt was sentenced to 25 years in prison for intent to distribute 2.4 grams of heroin in 2012. Through his own research, he discovered a Supreme Court case, Lafler v. Cooper, that invalidated his sentence in 2016. 
While in prison, Merritt was temporarily moved to solitary confinement in 2015 after asking to post an image with a quote he read in a book in the prison library, he shared on Tuesday’s panel. Merritt had not yet posted the quote when he was detained by five officers, moved to solitary confinement and told that he was attempting to incite a riot. 
The free speech rights of incarcerated Americans should not be unrightfully restricted by the corrections system, according to Merritt.
“So when we speak about people incarcerated being able to write or, as I said, just at the minimal level, just even be able to think of change, it can be stopped at any given moment with the excuse that you’re trying to incite a population against the overregulation of the truth,” Merritt said.
In most prisons, incarcerated Americans are never briefed on the rights they have during their sentences, according to panelist Amy Fettig, deputy director of the ACLU Prisons Project.
“We should be doing everything we can to make sure that people who are incarcerated are as close to the population on the outside as possible,” Fettig said.
In most prisons, incarcerated Americans are never briefed on the rights they have during their sentences, and increased accessibility to incarcerated citizens could help protect their rights, according to Fettig.
“We should be doing everything we can to make sure that people who are incarcerated are as close to the population on the outside as possible,” Fettig said.
Free speech rights also include voting rights, which are almost universally denied to incarcerated Americans against international norms, according to Howard.
“The U.S. is actually exceptional in denying people the right to vote while they are incarcerated, and it is completely exceptional beyond every measure in denying 6 million people the right to vote, and this is state-by-state, after they have served their time,” Howard said.
Today, Maine and Vermont are the only two states where felons maintain the right to vote during their sentences. Incarcerated Americans have a strong desire to be involved in the political process, according to Castón. 
The perception of incarcerated people as active citizens is crucial in the reform process, Castón said.
“I think that the way we excel is when you see us as concrete people, whether we are detained or incarcerated, you see us as a person, you see us as a human being, and I think that’s tied directly to the voting rights,” Castón said. “That we are still citizens, we just happen to be currently incarcerated, so our voices matter, our opinions matter.”

In a celebration honoring over 140 graduating members and allies of the LGBTQ community Thursday, speakers and attendees at Georgetown University’s 11th annual Lavender Graduation emphasized work the university can continue to do to support the community on campus.
The ceremony, hosted by the LGBTQ Resource Center and the Tagliabue Initiative for LGBTQ Life, featured keynote speaker Joshua Guzmán (SFS ’10), an assistant professor of gender studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, and was held in the Healey Family Student Center Great Room. Three undergraduate students, a faculty member, a staff member, a medical student and a law student were given awards for their contributions to the Georgetown community.
Lavender Graduation sends an important message to the Georgetown community given the university’s previous history of overlooking its LGBTQ students, according to English professor and Department Chair Ricardo Ortiz.
“It welcomes everyone at Georgetown to celebrate the important milestone of graduation for students who identify either as LGBTQ or as allies of the LGBTQ community,” Ortiz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “That’s a really powerful statement of recognition, solidarity and support for a community that had historically been at best neglected, at worst violently marginalized throughout the University’s history.”
On-campus discrimination against LGBTQ students has historically been a frequent issue for the community. Following a string of hate crimes against LGBTQ students in 2007 that were not addressed publicly by the university, students responded by petitioning the administration for action through demonstrations in Red Square and sit-ins in the office of University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ‘79, GRD ‘95). The actions eventually led to the establishment of the LGBTQ Resource Center in 2008.
Diego Tum-Monge (COL ’19) won an award as Champion for the LGBTQ Community, Harry Clow (MSB ’19) as Bridge Builder and Angela Maske (NHS ’19, GRD ’20) for the Beyond the Gates award. Associate English Professor Christine So received the award for Faculty Commitment to the LGBTQ Community and Assistant Director for Residential Education Eileen Rodriguez was awarded Staff Commitment to the LGBTQ Community.
Tum-Monge was recognized for his work with the LGBTQ Resource Center and Georgetown Scholars Program. Winning the award serves as motivation to continue working for the Latinx and LGBTQ communities, according to Tum-Monge.
“For me, this award just accumulates everything that I’ve done and brings it in a space where I can say that I’ll keep fighting beyond this award that I share with the LGBTQ community here at Georgetown,” Tum-Monge said. 
The Lavender Graduation was first established in 2009, one year after Georgetown’s LGBTQ Resource Center formally opened its doors. Georgetown’s past committment to the LGBTQ community was disappointing, and the university was belated in establishing the necessary resources and support centers for its LGBTQ students, according to women and gender studies professor and Academic Director of the Community Scholars Program Elizabeth Velez.
“I think that Georgetown came late to even having an LGBTQ center, and it’s so important for students to have this space where they feel like they’re understood and they’re honored,” Velez said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think Lavender Graduation is important in terms of celebrating them for the four years they’ve been here doing this work.”
There is still more that can be done to increase the visibility of and support for the LGBTQ community on campus, and the university should increase support for LGBTQ studies research by expanding supp, according to Ortiz. 
“There is no field of the arts, humanities, or social sciences, including law and policy (and even some natural sciences), where the study of gender and sexuality doesn’t have central relevance, and that fact should be more fully represented by Georgetown given its mission as a teaching-centered research institution,” Ortiz wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Graduating students can take the values emphasized at Lavender Graduation with them as they transition into their lives after Georgetown, according to School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman, who was present at the event.
“I hope that spirit is something that continues to drive students in their professional lives as they graduate,” Hellman said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is a great transition for them into the next stage of their lives, and I hope they take the lessons of this Lavender Graduation, which is an important feature on campus, and put that into the next stage of their lives.”

A degree from Georgetown College will no longer require a minimum number of courses in an effort to alleviate the academic burden placed on students.
Previously, students needed to take at least 38 courses in order to earn a College degree. Students must still complete 120 credits — a typical course is three credits — to graduate, but the minimum has been removed.
This curriculum change affects all students graduating in fall 2019 or later, according to an April 23 email from the Georgetown College Dean’s Office informing College students of the update. 
The proposal passed April 15 in a unanimous vote of the College Executive Council, the College’s governing body comprised of faculty, deans and students, according to Jacqueline Crispino (COL ’19), a College Academic Council student representative.
The College’s decision to amend degree requirements intends to achieve fairness across majors and eliminate unnecessary confusion in degree tracking, according to the email announcing the update.
The previous course minimum was especially stressful for students pursuing degrees in the sciences, biology major Amelia Smith (COL ’22) wrote in an email to The Hoya. Smith, who is also on the pre-veterinary track, has requirements for her biology major, the College core requirements and the pre-health studies course recommendations. With the former 38 course minimum, meeting all these requirements entailed an overwhelming course load, Smith said.
“This is the best news I’ve gotten all month,” Smith wrote. “As a pre-vet student myself, I can attest to the daunting academic rigor between vet school prerequisites, major requirements, and the college’s previous requirement for minimum course load. With five-to-six credit science courses and intensive languages, you basically have to be at 20 credits [per semester] constantly to meet the previous course requirement.”
The course minimum was separate from the credit minimum to graduate, causing some students to take costly summer courses to meet the minimum, according to College Vice Dean Sue Lorenson. Tuition for undergraduate summer sessions is $1,496 per credit, according to the summer sessions website. The change aims to eliminate this unnecessary financial hardship.
“We were concerned about the potential financial hardship the course count might create for students who arrive at Georgetown without advanced credit,” Lorenson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We notified all students who will be affected by the change, recognizing that it may affect some students’ plans.”
The College Academic Council found through research that exceptions to the course number requirement are given to one-third of students in the College, which was a strong indication that the requirement should be removed, according to Crispino.
“The 38 course minimum therefore was only a requirement for some of the students in the College,” Crispino wrote in an email to The Hoya. “How can a rule only be a rule two-thirds of the time?”
Managing course count adjustments and requests for exemptions placed a heavy administrative burden on the deans, according to Lorenson. Students who transfer from or study abroad at schools with different academic systems, Georgetown programs that entail courses with credits lower than the typical three credits, or other unique situations complicated the 38 course minimum for both students and faculty.
“We make adjustments for transfer students who come from ‘4/4’ schools, for students who study abroad in different systems, and for students who take lower-credit classes which can be ‘bundled’ (like Core Pathways courses or music/theater performance courses),” Lorenson wrote. “These manual adjustments to the count are administratively time consuming and potentially error prone.”
The curriculum change will give College students more scheduling flexibility and standardize Georgetown’s requirements with other universities’ requisites, according to Lorenson.
“We recognized that the College’s degree requirements were anomalous,” Lorenson wrote. “A review of requirements at peer institutions revealed that we were were the only school to deal in the currency of courses and credits, instead of credits alone.”

Student advocacy groups and residential organizations partnered to promote environmental awareness and the importance of sustainability at Earth Day events across campus April 23.
Georgetown’s celebrations occurred the day after the annual Earth Day, a global movement featuring political action and advocacy that began in 1970. 
This year’s on-campus programming focused on promoting practical ways that Georgetown students can live sustainably.
The main Earth Day event took place on Harbin Patio, put on by a collaboration between residential organizations and environmental groups including the Georgetown University Student Association sustainability policy team, Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network and Harbin Residential Living. 
Representatives from the groups informed students about opportunities to get involved with sustainability initiatives on campus at the two-hour event. Interhall Council provided free vegan chicken nuggets, burgers and cookies from HipCityVeg, a vegan restaurant chain, according to Interhall Council Vice President Katelyn Barr (SFS ’22).
“I wanted to make sure the event provided accessible information and was geared towards the average college student,” Barr wrote in an email to The Hoya. “After all, we don’t want to seem like we are asking people to change their entire lives. Instead, we want to provide easy and simple ways to be more environmentally conscious every day.”
Showcasing plant-based alternatives for foods can help reduce an individual’s carbon footprint and combat climate change, according to Barr.
“Animal agriculture adds a significant amount of carbon emissions to the atmosphere every day,” Barr wrote. “If everyone reduced their meat and dairy intake, even just through a simple goal like ‘Meatless Mondays,’ we could reduce carbon emissions and slow climate change.” 
The GUSA sustainability policy team, a student government subcommittee tasked with addressing environmental issues on campus, participated in the event by passing out sets of bamboo utensils as a green alternative to plastic utensils as part of their “Go Plastic-Free” campaign. Launched in February, the initiative includes semesterly training sessions for the leaders of student organizations and a pledge for those groups to reduce their reliance on single-use plastics.
The policy team hoped to gain support and momentum for the campaign by tabling at the Earth Day event, according to GUSA Sustainability Chair Rowlie Flores (COL ’22). 
“Most of our focus for the last year went into our Go Plastic-Free campaign where we pushed to get clubs to depend less on single-use plastics,” Flores wrote in an email to The Hoya. “People were curious about Georgetown’s current recycling and compost situation and I was able to get more signatures for the Go Plastic-Free campaign that I mentioned earlier.”
In addition to the event held on Harbin Patio, the Students of Georgetown, Inc., commonly known as The Corp, held their first ever two mile Earth Day run in the Georgetown neighborhood April 23. The event was in collaboration with Outdoor Voices, an athletic apparel store in Georgetown, that provided free hats to participants.
The Earth Day run highlighted the benefits of exercising outdoors, according to Lille Brown (SFS ’20), philanthropy chair of The Corp. 
“The Corp’s goal in partnering with Outdoor Voices was to encourage students to celebrate Earth Week by being outside and being active,” Brown wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The run served as a kickoff to other Earth Day promotions and activities The Corp will hold through the end of April.
In addition to the run, The Corp has been promoting sustainability throughout the school year through a punch card promotion where students who use a reusable cup ten times at various Corp store fronts will receive their eleventh drink free of charge. Participating locations include Uncommon Grounds, The Midnight Mug, More Uncommon Grounds and Grounded. 
By encouraging community members to use reusable cups and by providing strawless lids, The Corp hopes to promote environmentally friendly habits among students, according to Brown. 
“We hope this promotion encourages greater sustainability and cup reuse habits among the student body,” Brown wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
On-campus Earth Day events serve as a way to celebrate the progress that has been made in protecting the environment but also to remind individuals of the work that still has not been completed, according to GREEN Vice President Henry Congdon (SFS ’21). 
“Creating a more sustainable future is going to require all of us, and Earth Day is an important time to celebrate what has been accomplished so far, and raise awareness of what still needs to be done,” Congdon wrote in an email to The Hoya.

After users experienced multiple injuries because of brake issues, Capital Bikeshare is temporarily pulling its electric bikes from Washington, D.C.
Capital Bikeshare’s parent company, Lyft, announced the change on the Capital Bikeshare website April 14 in a statement responding to rider reports of excessively strong bike brakes. Lyft has pulled its e-bikes from Washington, D.C., San Francisco and New York City after dozens of riders reported injuries within the last few months, according to The New York Times.
Capital Bikeshare is offering exclusively nonelectric bikes until the electric bikes are evaluated for safety, according to a company spokesperson.
“We just wanted to make sure everybody was safe,” the spokesperson said in an interview with The Hoya. “I assume during that time we are also going to be looking at the mechanics of the bike, making sure that each mechanic on the bike is safe for the customer.”
Capital Bikeshare is owned by the United States’ largest bike-share system operator Motivate, which is a subset of the ride-sharing company Lyft. Motivate designed the bikes to use battery power to assist riders as they pedal. The company also operates Citi Bike in New York City and Ford GoBike in San Francisco, both cities where the company has also pulled e-bikes off the streets.
All three companies released identical statements on their websites, acknowledging the strong brakes without mentioning the injuries.
“We recently received a small number of reports from riders who experienced stronger than expected braking force on the front wheel,” Capital Bikeshare wrote in the statement. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are proactively removing the electric bikes from service for the time being.”
Lyft was aware of reports of injuries but a spokesperson for the parent company would not say how many, according to The Washington Post.
An initial round of e-bikes was rolled out in September 2018 as part of a pilot program in D.C. called Capital Bikeshare Plus that ran through the month of November, according to The Washington Post. Unlike normal Capital Bikeshare bikes, the Plus bikes are battery powered and capable of reaching up to 18 mph, according to The Washington Post.
Capital Bikeshare launched in 2010 when Arlington and D.C. made the decision to combine their bike-sharing systems. The operator has since grown in size and moved into more counties, with 500 stations and a fleet of over 4,300 bikes throughout the DMV area, according to the company’s website.
The company announced March 18 that it was adding an additional 500 e-bikes to its fleet along with an additional $1 per ride charge for e-bike users.
Public perception of e-bikes is evolving as the method of transportation gains popularity, according to Christopher Jewell, a representative for Biking at Georgetown, a division of the sustainability office at the university that provides information about bicycling options for students.
“We’re at the beginning stages of the e-bike revolution, and there’s no going back,” Jewell wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The ‘cheating’ stigma of e-bikes is starting to fade, and e-bikes will put to rest the notion that you have to be super fit and all geared up to be on a bicycle.”
However, road accidents may slow the growth of e-bikes, according to Jewell. Cycling activist David Savolesh and a pedestrian were killed by drivers over Easter weekend. Salovesh, 54, previously advocated for protected bike lanes and safer roads for cyclists, according to the Washington City Paper. D.C. lawmakers introduced a bill Tuesday in response to these incidents that would expedite road safety improvements to Florida Avenue NE, where Savolesh was killed.

The Rite Aid store at 2255 Wisconsin Avenue is set to close May 18 following the purchase of thousands of Rite Aid stores by Walgreens in 2017, according to The Georgetowner.
The Rite Aid pharmacies will close ahead of the store closing May 13. Walgreens originally planned to close 600 underperforming Rite Aids but could now close up to 750, according to Forbes. No business has been announced as a replacement yet. 
The Rite Aid employees were given little notice about the closure, according to the Georgetowner. However, Walgreens plans to relocate workers to other storefronts in comparable jobs, according to a Walgreens spokesperson. 
“We are committed to taking care of our team members throughout this process, and expect to have positions at other locations for the majority of store employees who are impacted. We will be making every effort to find the same or similar positions for team members,” a Walgreens spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The location is one of 1,932 Rite Aids nationwide that the company sold to Walgreens, according to a Walgreens spokesperson. Walgreens bought the stores and three distribution centers from Rite Aid for approximately $4.4 billion in March 2018 after an earlier merger deal fell through because of federal antitrust regulations, according to Forbes. 
Walgreens will transfer customer pharmacy records to their location at 3301 New Mexico Ave and customers have been notified of the change, according to the Walgreens spokesperson. 
Until the Rite Aid closes, most of its inventory is 50 percent off. Glover Park resident Thomas Shaw said he was a regular at Rite Aid because of the store’s competitive prices. 
“I would come here all the time because I had a Rite Aid card and they had really good deals,” Shaw said in an interview with The Hoya. “I’m going to go to CVS now.” 
The 2255 Wisconsin Ave. Rite Aid location opened in 2016 and competes with a CVS across the street, which will remain open. Despite the 2016 Rite Aid opening, Glover Park resident and Georgetown history professor Judith Tucker has remained a loyal CVS customer.  
“The new one opened, I didn’t change my habits. I still come here,” Tucker said in an interview with The Hoya.
The Safeway at 1855 Wisconsin Ave. offers consumers another option to purchase food and miscellaneous items. The Wisconsin Avenue Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle bus stops at the Safeway on its route through Glover Park, making the location accessible to students. 
Several Georgetown students were unaware of the Rite Aid location and instead frequented competitors. CVS and Safeway meet shopping needs according to Georgetown student, Alena O’Connor (COL ’22). 
“I didn’t even know there was a Rite Aid so I’ve never been to that. I’ve gone to CVS and Safeway about an equal number of times but CVS is always for smaller stuff whereas Safeway is more like actual grocery shopping,” O’Connor wrote in a statement to The Hoya. 
The Wisconsin and O Street CVS location is the closest pharmacy to Georgetown’s campus. 
Six Rite Aid locations in Washington, D.C., remain open and are operated by Walgreens, according to the Walgreens’ website.  
The Rite Aid shutdown comes after a series of recent closures in Glover Park. A Starbucks across the street also closed in March 2018 and the neighborhood’s Whole Foods closed in March 2017 after a rat infestation. 
The Whole Foods had helped bring new residents and young families to the neighborhood, but its closure has hurt local businesses and decreased foot traffic, according to BisNow, a digital media company. In response, local residents have petitioned to bring it back.
ReEnvision Glover Park, a neighborhood task force that has dedicated itself to revitalizing the Glover Park section of Wisconsin Avenue, said the closures have hurt small businesses in the area.
“The recent vacancies of our anchor tenants (Rite Aid, Starbucks and more importantly Whole Foods) along the Glover Park portion of Wisconsin Avenue have been challenging not only for the community but also for the local mom and pop shops that have depended on the foot traffic that these national stores bring to the retail corridor,” the group wrote in a statement to The Hoya.
