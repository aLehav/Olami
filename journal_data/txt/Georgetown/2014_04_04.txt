Carol Lancaster (SFS ’64) has stepped down as dean of the School of Foreign Service, as announced in an April 2 email to the Georgetown community from University President John J. DeGioia. SFS Acting Dean James Reardon-Anderson will remain in place until Lancaster’s replacement is announced in fall 2015.
Lancaster took a leave of absence in late November after being diagnosed with a brain tumor. Georgetown University Medical Center doctors removed the mass December 2.
“Carol has decided now to step down as Dean to devote her full attention to her recovery,” DeGioia wrote.
Lancaster will assume the position of dean emerita and will serve as an SFS professor upon her return to campus, the time of which is yet undetermined.
According to Reardon-Anderson, who has served as the SFS acting dean since November, Lancaster submitted her resignation to DeGioia “in the past few weeks.”
“In terms of returning to professor, that would really depend on the pace of the recovery,” Reardon-Anderson said. “She’s effectively resigned as dean, and she has been named emerita. Instead, there’s an acting dean, and I will be the acting dean until the new dean is in place.”
Reardon-Anderson estimated that Lancaster’s permanent replacement would take office in summer 2015, when her term was scheduled to end. A search committee convened by the president will most likely assemble this spring and organize during the summer, with a formal announcement of her replacement made in the fall. The search process will take six to nine months, with formal recommendations most likely forthcoming in spring 2015.
For now, Reardon-Anderson’s focus lies in shepherding Lancaster’s projects forward.
“All of the things she started are now well underway,” he said. “While she was dean, I was the senior associate dean, so I worked quite closely with her, so I was quite familiar with all her goals and plans. Taking temporary responsibility was very easy. I have been seeing her on a fairly regular basis and reporting to her.”
Lancaster, one of the first female SFS graduates, returned to the university as a professor in 1981, after earning a masters and doctorate at the London School of Economics and stints in the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development. At Georgetown, she served as a professor of politics, the director of the African Studies Program, the director of the Master of Foreign Service Program and the director of the Mortara Center for International Studies, before assuming the deanship in 2010, after serving as interim dean the previous year.
During her tenure, Lancaster oversaw the addition of the Global Human Development and Asian Studies masters programs, as well as the establishment of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security.
“She’s just been a huge asset to the university,” Reardon-Anderson said. “She’s really served the school and the university in many different ways.”
The SFS Dean’s Office spearheaded a drive for well wishes in December, following Lancaster’s surgery, with a digital card. In his email, DeGioia thanked Lancaster for her service and anticipated her return. Provost Robert Groves also expressed admiration for Lancaster.
“When I arrived at Georgetown last year as a new provost, Carol Lancaster welcomed me with genuine support. Over the early weeks, I learned how devoted she was to building a strong SFS and how committed she was to Georgetown,” Groves wrote in an email. “I look forward to her return as a colleague and thank her for her service.”
Similarly, BMW Center for German and European Studies Director and SFS Faculty Chair Jeffrey Anderson described Lancaster’s commitment to the school.
“I started as Faculty Chair this past summer, so I was able to work with her closely, and I’ve known her for over a decade. It has always been a pleasure and honor to work with Carol, and she did the impossible, balancing the needs of the provosts above her and the faculty under her charge,” Anderson said. “Her vision as a leader to build upon our solid foundations at SFS, and her ability to resist the temptation to start from scratch was very impressive.”
SFS Academic Council President Kyle Zhu (SFS ’14) highlighted his appreciation for Lancaster’s dedication to students.
“Dean Lancaster was really caring about finding out the student perspective on a lot of issues and she was really proactive in making sure she got basically the full support of the vote of students. With Dean Lancaster, we built a really good relationship between the Academic Council and the Dean’s Office,” Zhu said.

Muriel Bowser, an upshot D.C. councilmember representing Ward 4, won the D.C. Democratic mayoral primary Tuesday with 44.2 percent of the vote, bringing the administration of Mayor Vincent Gray to a close and catapulting Bowser to the position of presumptive mayor in a city where winning the Democratic primary is almost always akin to winning the general election.
The lowest voter turnout in 30 years, dipping below 32 percent, coupled with slow election returns Tuesday night prevented Gray from conceding the race until after midnight. Up until a few months ago, the race seemed firmly within his grasp.
With a 12-percent edge against Gray’s 32.3 percent, Bowser has earned a strong endorsement from D.C. Democrats heading into the November general election. In large part, Bowser was able to soundly defeat Gray by racking up large margins in the voting precincts Gray lost in the 2010 elections. Ultimately, Bowser won 28 precincts that Gray had carried in 2010, most of them in Bowser’s home turf in Ward 4, which encompasses the north corner of the city.
Additionally, Gray’s vote total in Ward 8, considered his strongest area of support, decreased by 6,590 votes from 2010. As his support waned in the campaign’s closing weeks, Gray made a last-ditch effort to rally voters east of the Anacostia River, travelling to Ward 7 to cut the ribbon at a subsidized housing complex on Minnesota Avenue, NE and visiting a church in Ward 8, whose pastor, C. Matthew Hudson, praised Gray as the “best mayor this side of heaven.” However, despite his success in Wards 7 and 8 in his last election, Gray’s efforts this year could not stem the rising tide against him elsewhere in the city.
Bowser was able not only to defeat Gray, but also to separate herself from a field of six candidates, including three other councilmen, Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) and Vincent Orange (D-At Large), by distinguishing herself as a fresh, energetic politician able to gain traction across the District’s disparate eight wards.
“All eight wards is not a slogan. We’ve tried to demonstrate that physically by where we chose to have our election night rally [at Imagine Southeast Public Charter School in Ward 8] and where we chose to open campaign offices. We’ll be out there again before the general, in all eight wards across the city, knocking on doors and listening to voters. It will be a focus on the entire city, and that’s also how Muriel intends to govern, and I think that’s the most important thing,” Bowser’s campaign manager, Bo Shuff, said.
Shuff attributed the support for Bowser’s campaign to her clear vision for D.C., including more efficient school reform, increased vocational training and stronger protection for the middle class, as well as honesty in government.
“I think other candidates’ supporters realized that they had far more in common with Muriel than they did with Mayor Gray and wanted to see those types of changes and reforms brought to city hall,” Shuff said.
In his concession speech, Gray praised the work he and his staff have done over his 3 1/4 years as mayor, a period viewed as a continuation of the robust — albeit uneven — economic progress the District has seen over the past decade. In an attempt to fulfill his promise to bring more jobs, housing and shopping into struggling areas of D.C., Gray successfully pushed Wal-Mart to agree to open a fifth store in southeast D.C. in Skyland Shopping Center. Additionally, Gray actively encouraged real estate deals and promotions involving technology, higher education and healthcare in more underdeveloped areas of the District.
“I think the work that we have done over the last 3 1/4 years has been nothing short of phenomenal,” Gray told a small crowd of loyal supporters during his concession speech Tuesday evening.
However, new construction has come with high price tags, including an $8.3 million food pavilion on the grounds of the former St. Elizabeth’s hospital in southeast D.C. The pavilion, designed for the nearly 4,000 U.S. Coast Guard employees who work across the street, has ended up going $3 million over its original budget.
For Gray’s supporters, the disappointment was palpable. Much of his campaign was run under a cloud of suspicion stemming from the federal investigation in his 2010 campaign, in which he allegedly received illegal campaign contributions in order to fund a “shadow campaign” to smear his opponents, including then-Mayor Adrian Fenty, whom Gray eventually defeated.
While Gray was able to hold a steady lead in the polls, his campaign was dealt a heavy blow March 10 when Ronald Machen, the U.S. attorney investigating Gray’s 2010 campaign, held a press conference announcing the guilty plea of Jeffrey Thompson, the man who claims he met with Gray prior to the race and agreed to funnel money illegally into his campaign.
One of Gray’s most prominent supporters, Councilmember and former Mayor Marion Barry (D-Ward 8), summed up what seems to be the sentiment among many of Gray’s supporters.
“Ron Machen decided this election,” Barry tweeted on Election Day as it became clear that Gray would not be re-elected.
What follows is yet another period of uncertainty, as Gray finishes out the last nine months of his term still facing the possibility of a federal indictment. If indicted, Gray has made it clear he will fight all charges against him to clear his name of any wrongdoing.
“I will see this through,” Gray said in one of the campaign’s most heated debates Feb. 26.
For Bowser, who fought criticism that she was inexperienced and lacked the knowledge to manage a city of D.C.’s size throughout the race, the next seven months will likely be spent shoring up Democratic support for the November general election against longtime Councilman David Catania (I-At Large) (SFS’ 90, LAW ’94).
Based on the District’s electoral history, Catania, a white, gay ex-Republican would normally be considered at least a long shot, but with four citywide electoral victories under his belt, Catania has demonstrated that he is not a candidate to be taken lightly.
But Catania, a member of the D.C. Council since 1997, has a long way to go before he has any chance of besting Bowser, who will likely have the full resources of the Democratic Party in the District behind her. Recent polls by The Washington Post have Bowser up by more than 30 points in a head-to-head matchup against Catania.
Georgetown University Student Association Undersecretary for D.C. Relations Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17) expressed her frustration with the candidates’ lack of outreach to the student voting population.
“We are a huge voting block, and with the possibility of same-day registration, there is no reason why students shouldn’t be targeted by campaign efforts. To my knowledge, very few students voted. I don’t think many students even knew there was an election going on,” Hinerfeld said. “Come November, it will be important to try to gauge student interest with the election as these policies will directly affect us.”
GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), a former president of the College Democrats, hoped that Bowser would engage with the university if elected the District’s next mayor.
“While Muriel Bowser has not returned repeated requests to speak at Georgetown University, we hope that, if elected, her term as mayor brings a new attitude toward student engagement in District politics,” Tezel said.

When the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival, taking place from March 20 to April 13, announced its eight 2014 Goodwill Ambassadors, Sarah Santana (COL’16) was among those chosen to serve as a liaison between D.C. university students and the festival.
A double major in Japanese and Linguistics, as ambassador, Santana serves as a cultural liaison elaborating on the history and significance of the gift of 3,000 cherry trees from Mayor Yukio Ozaki of Tokyo to the city of Washington, D.C. in 1912. Other responsibilities include organizing festival events such as Family Days, the Blossom Kite Festival, the South Waterfront Fireworks Festival and the Youth Education Program.
“The Youth Education Program involves us going into various public and charter schools in the D.C. area in order to teach a special class about the gift of the trees, Japanese culture and the importance of Japanese-American relations,” Santana said.
Apart from the celebratory festival events, Santana emphasized the importance the festival places on the promotion of international relations and cross-cultural awareness. Through its sponsors and organizers, the festival aims to bring together talent from both Japan and America, including chefs, artists and performers.
“From the big-scale efforts put together in deciding on the events all the way to volunteers from various backgrounds who donate their time to the various activities, the festival really hinges upon the ability of people to lean into discomfort and learn something new about others and themselves,” she said.
Miyu Fujita (NHS ‘15), who participated in the Festival last year as a Goodwill Ambassador, praised the Festival for its cultural union of American and Japanese culture.
“Everyone comes to D.C. to see the cherry blossoms. It’s become a local yet international event where different nationalities come together to celebrate the new spring and friendship. Overall, the experience was very rewarding as I got to learn about D.C. and the culture of cherry blossoms,.” Fujita said.
Fujita also lauded the festival for its response to the 9.0 earthquake that struck off the coast of Japan in March 2011, as it carried out events to donate to the Japanese cause.
“What’s great about Cherry Blossom Festival is not just about celebrating the Japanese and American friendship, but it’s more about connecting all different kinds of people around the world and bringing them together.” Fujita said.
Danielle Davis, Communications Manager for the National Cherry Blossom Festival, assured readers that the unusually cold weather this past winter would not affect festival scheduling and confirmed that the peak bloom would occur around April 8-12.
“Although we did have to cancel the Blossom Kite Festival this past week due to inclement weather, the blossoms are predicted to be fully bloomed by next week which would be in line with the National Cherry Blossom Parade that will be held … April 12,” Davis said.

Students from Georgetown will take to the streets this Saturday as part of a nationwide protest of the Obama administration’s deportation of undocumented immigrants, encompassing 40 cities in a National Day of Action.
Hoyas for Immigrant Rights and the Georgetown University Immigration Coalition, two student groups advocating immigration reform, in coalition with Movimiento Estudiantil Chican@ de Aztlán, or MEChA, will lead a march to the rally from Georgetown’s front gates starting at 12 p.m. Approximatly 200 people are expected to attend the rally in front of the White House.
“Halting deportations is extremely important because, as we wait for progress on legislation, thousands of people are being deported, and this is simply unacceptable,” President of Hoyas for Immigrant Rights Citlalli Alvarez (COL ’16) said.
Since taking office in 2009, President Obama’s administration has deported 1.5 million undocumented immigrants, the highest during any presidential term. Every day, approximately 30,000 individuals are held in the U.S. immigration detention system, the largest in the world.
Associate Vice President for Federal Government Relations Scott Fleming (SFS ’72) noted that the displeasure leveled at the White House for its stance on immigration has not fallen on deaf ears.
“The issue of deportations is very much on the White House’s mind,” Fleming said. “It has been raised to the White House by Hispanic leaders, who represent various Hispanic organizations, and also by members of the Congressional Hispanic caucus.”
While members of Hoyas for Immigrant Rights organized and attended a similar march in October to call on the House of Representatives to take action on immigration reform, according to Sophia Sepp (SFS ’14), a student coordinator for the Day Laborer Exchange at Georgetown’s Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and Working Poor, the march Saturday more directly targets the administration’s immigration policy.
“There is a lot of discontent because the platform that he ran on was that he was going to fix the immigration system, and now he is the most hawkish,” Sepp said. “A lot of the debate in Congress also is about national security and needing to enforce the laws that we have.”
The rally, which will take place at 2 p.m. in Lafayette Square, is sponsored by Trabajadores Unidos in partnership with the National Day Labor Organizing Network, the D.C. Immigration Coalition and the Virginia Coalition of Latino Organizations. A national coalition of immigrant laborers, Trabajadores Unidos developed the slogan, “Not One More Deportation” for the rally.
According to NDLON Campaign Coordinator Salvador Sarmiento, supporters of the rally are asking Obama to use his executive authority to cease deportations. The NDLON assembled a list of six things that Obama could do without Congressional approval to reduce deportations including expanding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act and ending Operation Streamline in which groups migrants are sentenced before judges in border states such as Arizona in a matter of minutes.
“We’ve been very vocal about the very misguided programs that have created a deportation machine to basically round up immigrant workers,” Sarmiento said.
Last year, Obama took executive action to allow young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children to apply for work permits and avoid deportation. However, the program, entitled Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, does not alter the immigrants’ status or provide a path to citizenship. The protesters are calling for an expansion of the executive order to include adults with no criminal history and strong ties to the United States.
“Trying to navigate that balance between maintaining the legal things that you have set up in society and also acknowledging the human aspect is important,” Sepp said.
Protesters are also calling for Obama to end the Secure Communities program which disseminates informations about individuals’ immigration status when they are fingerprinted in a local prison, because, rather than upholding its original goal of deporting criminals, the program is currently used as a general deportation facilitation tool.
“I think this is an ongoing conversation,” Sarmiento said. “Immigrants have really put themselves out there, sometimes risking their livelihoods and their well-being, by telling their stories and by committing acts of civil disobedience to stop deportation.”
Sepp, who co-led an Alternative Spring Break Border Awareness trip to the Mexican border in El Paso, Texas this year, stressed the need for face-to-face interaction in bringing about reform and the power of conducting the march in the nation’s capital.
“You get this face-to-face interaction with people that really brings home the human dimension, which is something that was lost a lot in the national debate about immigration reform,” Sepp said. “Especially in D.C., we have a lot of social capital and the opportunities to bring more attention to the issue.”
According to Fleming, Georgetown is a strong proponent of immigration reform legislation and the Dream Act, which has the potential to affect students on campus.
“We are very much involved in the immigration debate more broadly,” Fleming said. “[University President John J. DeGioia] has weighed in on several occasions, some of them going back many years at this point, in support of comprehensive immigration reform and in support in particular of changes that relate to the Dream Act.”
Although comprehensive immigration reform is unlikely to pass in the House this year, Georgetown’s participation in the rally has increased student interest in taking a more active role in the conversation on immigration reform.
“We are happy to see that there is a lot of interest and support coming from Georgetown students and faculty,” Sarmiento said.
Alvarez echoed Sarmiento’s thoughts, emphasizing the prescient nature of Saturday’s march for Georgetown’s immigrant community.
“Our communities, our families cannot wait,” Alvarez said. “This issue may seem miles away on the Hilltop, but it directly affects the lives of immigrant Hoyas.”

The Marver H. Bernstein Symposium brought United States Supreme Court Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor to Gaston Hall on Wednesday for a conversation entitled “A Life in the Law,” sponsored by the Office of the President and the government department.
After introductions by University President John J. DeGioia and Robert Katzmann, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Georgetown University Law Center professor Eloise Pasachoff — who clerked for Sotomayor as her first year as justice — took over to guide the conversation.
Sotomayor opened with a few anecdotes about her initial encounters with Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and Justice John Paul Stevens, as well as her mission to introduce herself to every elevator clerk on day one.
Sotomayor emphasized that even though the court seems obtuse and divided, it is still important for the public to recognize the unique burden it faces. Her appearance in Gaston coincided with the day’s announcement of the Supreme Court’s decision to lift limits on private donations to political campaigns.
“You have to believe that this group of nine is passionate about finding the right answer. No matter what we all think the right answer is, we’re all filled with the same passion and that’s how I can stand to be on the losing side,” Sotomayor said. “We are the highest court. If you get it wrong, you are affecting people’s lives. If not forever then for a very long time.”
Throughout the event, she referenced her most recent book, her memoir, “My Beloved World,” of which every GOCard-holder in attendance received a signed copy. The book ties her childhood, growing up in a Spanish-speaking home in the Bronx, to her time at Princeton, Yale Law and her career in the New York Circuit Court, leading up to the confirmation process to the Supreme Court. Although now she is entrenched in her position in the Supreme Court for life, her New York ties still run deep.
“The Supreme Court would be perfect if I could cut it out and put it in lower Manhattan,” Sotomayor said.
When the session moved into answering student questions, submitted in writing at the beginning of the event, the discussion shifted to focus on her life as a Latina and how working in law as a minority woman was both vitally important and intensely difficult.
“I know that I used my minority status and people’s expectations of me to my advantage,” she said. “And I still do that.”
Her stories of the dismissive lawyers and disrespectful treatment that peppered her entire career on the bench clearly illustrate that, for many, it is hard to separate the stereotypes associated with her background from her reputation as an esteemed judicial scholar.
“Someone told me I only got into Yale because I was Latina,” she said. “I told them that may be true, but that it didn’t hurt that I graduated summa cum laude, Phi Kappa Alpha from Princeton.”
Sotomayor’s words resonated with members of the audience.
“I think it was really important for a lot of people to hear that, especially as a Chinese-American student here I think a lot of that stuff is relevant to me as well, especially hearing about different challenges that minorities have in society today,” Daniel Choy (SFS ’15) said.
“I thought she was really engaging and it was great to hear a firsthand perspective and even how she had her own fears and doubts as a Supreme Court justice,” Eric Sheets (SFS ’17) said.

Students have created a petition to make the main campus of the university tobacco smoke free, coinciding with the convening of a nonsmoking campus working group March 25 regarding the university’s smoking policy.
After the working group’s formation in February, spurred by Assistant Vice President for Benefits and Chief Benefits Officer Charles DeSantis, it held its first meeting March 25.
The meeting comes in the wake of the Georgetown University Medical Center’s campus smoking ban, mirrored at The George Washington University.
“[GWU] has gone smoke free but does not do any enforcement,” Director of Health Education Services Carol Day said. “Essentially, that just means making a statement for where the university stands on the matter. The medical campus is another model, but they’ve been very strict with enforcing standards regarding nonsmoking.”
Students in a Health Promotion and Disease Prevention class at the School of Nursing and Health Sciences, including smoke-free student advocates Kelly Kimball (NHS ’16) and Cailin Grant (NHS ’16), said that they believe the issue deserves more attention on campus because of the health risks associated with tobacco usage.
“We feel that a smoke-free campus would exemplify the Georgetown values of cura personalis and being men and women for others.” Grant said. “Smoking is a huge public health issue. It not only harms those who smoke, but also those who are subjected to it.”
The movement to ban smoking elicited backlash from some students, prompting vigorous debate on the “Petition to Make Georgetown a Smoke Free Campus” Facebook event page, which garnered 244 attendees.
“I would be really disappointed if they decided to ban smoking on campus.” Andrew Shaughnessy (SFS ’16) said. “It’s a personal choice, and I don’t think that the university should go so far as to ban smoking.”
Others recognized the dangers of smoking in certain situations, but also stood by the smokers’ rights to continue doing so.
“Obviously smoking cigarettes inside isn’t allowed because of secondhand smoke, but if you want to smoke outside and not blow smoke into other people’s faces, then that should be allowed,” Juan Luis Tirado (COL ’16), who smokes e-cigarettes because they are less damaging to lungs and vocal chords, said. “I would totally be for support groups for people to stop smoking, but not anything that makes it mandatory, that’s counterproductive.”
Petition organizer Sonya Nasim (NHS ’16) put the emphasis on students enacting positive chance on campus.
“Can we as public health advocates watch the campus allow smoking to negatively impact our community?” Nasim said. “I don’t think banning smoking is the panacea, but it’s a step in the right direction that lots of universities and college campuses have taken.”
Currently, smoking on the main campus is not allowed inside buildings, or within 25 feet of entrances, windows or outdoor air intakes, in accordance with Washington, D.C. laws. There are also no designated smoking areas on campus.
“Georgetown is committed to maintaining an environment that is reasonably free from tobacco smoke,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said. “We are always exploring new ways of promoting a culture of wellness at Georgetown.”
In the past three years alone, a host of other D.C. schools have moved toward banning tobacco or smoking on their campuses. American University and the University of Maryland at College Park joined GWU in going smoke free.
GU Center for the Environment Director Edward Barrows has been involved with anti-smoking efforts on campus for a number of years. He said that his interest in the project stemmed from his desire for clean air and healthy students.
“I’ve been pushing for a smoke-free Georgetown for a number of years now, but up until now there hasn’t really been much progress,” Barrows said. “Last month, I sent a long email to Provost [Robert] Groves. I wonder if this finally started the ball rolling for the formation of the Smoke-free Campus Working Group.”
Despite being confident that smoking will eventually be banned on campus, Day recognized that smoking at Georgetown is a complicated issue.
“I think for the most part, people will be on board with this, but it is a human rights issue.” Day said. “It deals with individual choices, and smoking is not illegal. We’re trying to make it a sensitive campus and not wanting to impede on people’s rights to do that.”

In a simple declaration of feeling and national pride, Yulia Marushevska looks at the camera and declares, “I am a Ukrainian” before explaining why the Ukrainian people finally decided to rise up against their government leadership led by former president Viktor Yanukovych.
The two-minute YouTube video clip, published on Feb. 10, garnered three million hits within a week and made Marushevska the face of the Ukrainian Revolution for many in the west.
On April 2, Marushevska shared her experience in the Euromaidan and her hopes for Ukraine’s future in the Intercultural Center Auditorium. The uprising in Ukraine officially broke out in early February when a group of pro-Western protesters took to the streets in the capital city of Kiev to protest Yanukovych and his support of a pro-Russian economic agenda, in lieu of an attempt to join the European Union and reduce the country’s reliance on Russian energy and economic support.
Ben Moses, the film editor behind “I Am a Ukrainian,” weighed in on the role of social media in the protests.
“The police shut the Internet down before they moved to repress the small group of students that started the movement. They shut down the Internet five minutes before it [the crackdown] started,” Moses said.
The groups were brutally repressed by the police, and the following day, the crowd swelled to over 20,000. In the following days and weeks, the Ukrainian people took a stand against their government and succeeded in overthrowing Yanukovych, who in turn fled to Moscow.
Despite Russia’s subsequent invasion of the predominantly Russian-speaking Crimean Peninsula and Crimea’s immediate referendum affirming its annexation to Russian Federation, Marushevska views the uprising as a success.
“Ukraine is a young democracy that was born three months ago in the Euromaidan. Before that we were only the facade of a democracy with Soviet officials [making the decisions].”
Marushevska recalled a pre-revolution government riddled with corruption that negatively impacted average citizens.
“People had to pay to open their business, had to pay to close their business … every step of the way. That was very humiliating,” Marushevska said.
Marushevska, a doctoral candidate studying Ukrainian literature at Taras Shevchenko University in Kiev, hopes that her simple video and her speaking tour of American universities encourages the international community to support the cause of the Ukrainian freedom movement.
“Freedom is not only staying on the street, it’s taking a responsibility … it means to work for your community. You’re not only doing it for yourself, that’s living a very small life … you have to care about your country, politics, social life,” Marushevska said.
Marushevska is confident that Ukraine will remain strong in the face of pressure from both Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin. While she places her faith in the people rather than the new government that has recently emerged in Ukraine, she is certain Ukraine will develop into a strong, independent nation. Nonetheless, she does emphasize the importance of the international community’s support in realizing this goal.
“If you want to help, stay with us and come to Ukraine as a student, a tourist … we need people to see it with their own eyes and share,” Marushevska said.
Attendees came away impressed by Marushevska’s poise in delivering her message, and her ability to convey the emotions felt by everyday Ukrainians.
“Sometimes when you hear about things it doesn’t really hit you, but the fact that there’s someone in front of you who’s talking — who you can see and relate to — that changes things. It seems like we’re really seeing the actual problems and issues in a way that we really can’t on the news,” attendee Laura Catherine McCrary (COL ’16) said.
While Marushevska focused on the protesters’ success in the Euromaidan, many students asked for her views on the unfolding crisis between Ukraine and Russia. She partially credited the strong sense of unity that has emerged within Ukraine to common alignment against Putin and Yanukovych. Despite the crisis in the Crimea and uncertainties about Russia’s next step, Marushevska emphasized the deep historic and cultural connection between Ukraine and the former Soviet Union.
“Even though Putin is currently driving the people of Russia and Ukraine apart, we’re close neighbors and in the future we will be good partners,” Marushevska said.
Marushevska does not believe Russia will succeed moving further east into Ukraine proper. While she dreads the possibility of war, she trusts Ukrainians will stand strong since they have tasted freedom.
“[Ukrainians] are ready, but I don’t want this fight. It means war,” she said. “I hope nothing will happen, but we will defend ourselves.”

As research, recruitment, and faculty and student interest from China continues to grow at Georgetown, administrators are looking to build greater ties with China through Weibo, a Chinese social media site that works much like Twitter.
“Georgetown University is the leading university in Washington, D.C., and in the country in terms of its focus on China,” Supervisor of Academic Programs at the Asian Studies Program Robert Lyons said.
Aside from academic ties, Georgetown additionally holds strong community ties with China. Students from China make up the largest international population at Georgetown. China also serves as one of the top 10 destinations for student study abroad.
Georgetown first established its Weibo page in 2011, becoming one of the first universities in the United States to do so. Associate Director of International Initiatives Tuoya Wulan is heavily involved in the page’s development and continues to work on social media outreach in China.
“Engagement with Chinese social media is to build the university’s brand in China, to reach out to prospective and current students, parents, alumni and other interested visitors and to increase awareness of the student life on campus as well as teaching and research of Georgetown faculty,” Wulan wrote in an email.
According to School of Foreign Service Asian Studies Program Assistant Director Kat Harrington, the connection augments student learning as well as the university’s engagement with China.
“Through these social and academic initiatives, Georgetown is diversifying opportunities for its students interested in China. They provide ‘real world’ learning to complement the textbook learning on China,” Harrington wrote in an email.
The page also provides a space for Georgetown students and alumni to share personal stories.
The group also fosters connections among Hoyas abroad. For instance, a McDonough School of Business alumnus who is a food critic living in Shanghai, reached out to visiting MBA students through Weibo in order to take them out on a local food tour during their Global Residency Program in Shanghai.
Since the launch of Georgetown University’s account, the Law Center’s Graduate Admissions Office, Chinese Student Alliance, Chinese Student and Scholar Association and Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs have established their own Weibo pages.
While the Chinese government blocks social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, the domestic Chinese-language network offers an uncensored platform.
“Neither the Berkley Center’s Weibo page nor the university’s page has encountered any issues with censorship thus far,” Wulan wrote.
The center has little cause for worry anyway, as its page’s content is far from controversial. The Berkley Center’s Weibo page first launched in order to share a resource page that the center developed on religion in China and the United States. It continues to post news links, faculty research and relevant publications.
Director of the Berkley Center and Vice President for Global Engagement professor Thomas Banchoff believes Georgetown’s location and value system make it an ideal institutional partner for Chinese students and universities, but the Georgetown community stands to learn just as much from China.
“There is a lot that Georgetown students and faculty can learn about history, culture, religion, politics, science, business and other topics in China. … We look forward to continuing the two-way flow of students between Georgetown and universities across China,” Banchoff wrote in an email.
The university is looking to develop even more Chinese and foreign language pages outside of Weibo. Currently, a general university Chinese intro page and a Chinese info page for the Master of Science in Foreign Service program exist.
“A lot can be lost in translation in terms of meaning, significance,” Lyons said. “I think it’s useful that the university’s keeping up with trends that are currently going on in China and just because having an insight of culture, having experts in the field really helps us engage better.”

Georgetown University Debate Team captains Andrew Markoff (SFS ’14) and Andrew Arsht (COL ’14) won their second national debate championship title at the University of Indiana Bloomington on April 1.
After a long tournament that began on March 28, Markoff and Arsht were notified of their win at 2:30 a.m.
“The first person I see is [Arsht] and just the smile on his face, and then all of our teammates were gathered there right behind us, kind of tackle us, and everyone is celebrating,” Markoff said. “It’s just euphoria because of just how hard we’ve worked and how much it takes to get to that point.”
Coach Jonathan Paul also expressed pride in the win.
“I was just completely elated. I was proud of everyone on the team and coaching staff that worked so hard. I was just immensely excited for [them] that they were able to win their last debate and leave the debate team and Georgetown on top,” Paul said.
To qualify for one of the tournament’s 80 spots, a partnership had to be ranked in the national top 16 teams, win regional debates or be directly offered a spot. In addition to Markoff and Arsht, the pair of Andy McCoy (SFS ’16) and Tyler Engler (SFS ’15) also qualified. Markoff and Arsht are ranked third in the nation, while McCoy and Engler are ranked 12th. Going into the tournament, Georgetown overall ranked as the 10th best team.
This year’s National Debate Tournament topic was the reduction of presidential powers. The debaters said that this year’s topic proved especially difficult because of its contentious legal nature.
“The core question of the topic was about legal authority, but the vast majority of the literature wasn’t really about who has control over something like drone strikes — legally. It was more just ‘Are drone strikes good or bad,’” McCoy said. “It was really challenging, but it was good to force a very technical debate over a tough legal issue.”
Markoff and Arsht also won the championship title in 2012; together, the pair holds more championships than all but eight out of the 286 schools that attended the National Debate Tournament. Despite their previous win, however, Markoff and Arsht placed third in last year’s tournament.
“They won a national championship as sophomores, and it happened so fast and was so surreal — it was such a fairytale — that we kind of walked away with it with this unnatural understanding of how hard it was,” Assistant Coach Seth Gannon said. “Last year, they were even better at debate, and they were working so hard and yet didn’t win.”
According to Paul, Markoff and Arsht’s hard work, recruitment and mentorship strengthened the team to its current position as one of the nation’s top debate teams.
“They set the tone for other people on the team with their hard work, their preparation, and we had a great deal of success their first year,” Paul said. “It helped us a lot with recruiting good high school debaters to come to Georgetown and debate.”
Gannon agreed and praised their teamwork.
“They are a finely tuned machine. They kind of read one another’s minds, [and] they work together hardly having to talk,” Gannon said.

The School of Foreign Service’s 89th Annual Diplomatic Ball, held tonight at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, has resurrected old traditions and is also seeking to establish new ones.
As the 90th Diplomatic Ball and the School of Foreign Service centennial approach in the coming years, the 2014 Dip Ball Planning Committee Co-Chairs Victoire Carrasco (SFS ’15) and Isobel Blakeway-Phillips (SFS ’16) decided to go through university archives to bring back old traditions in a fresh way.
“Georgetown is a great place to do innovative things, to do innovative projects, to set up student groups, but what we like and what we’re trying to bring back is the fact that Georgetown also has a great history,” Carrasco said.
Most notably, the committee revived the turtle hunt, where wooden turtles with a voucher for subsidized ball tickets around their necks are hidden around campus for lucky students to discover.
“It was kind of a way to include campus also,” Carrasco said. “We found an ad in one of the archives and so we thought we’d change it up a bit and do something different.”
Turtle finders posted photos to the Georgetown University Diplomatic Ball Facebook page, where other archived material, including news clippings dating back 50 years, has been posted in the past few weeks.
Mixing the old with the new, the committee changed up the guest list with help from the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy. The ISD worked with the committee to invite mid-level foreign service officers and other professionals in the fields of international relations and government to encourage more interaction between students and professionals.
“We thought that inviting mid-level officials or professionals would be a good chance for students to actually get that real networking opportunity because sometimes with the older diplomats it’s a bit hard,” Carrasco said.
Many aspects of the ball, however, remain unchanged. Tickets for the event are, as is typical, sold out. Over 750 Georgetown students, State Department workers, professors and diplomats will attend. This year’s diplomats hail from 45 different countries, including Ukraine, Afghanistan, Egypt and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The Corcoran offers a venue appropriate for the specific capacity, financial needs and excitement of Dip Ball, according to SFS Special Programs Assistant Benjamin Zimmerman.
“Venue decisions come largely down to availability first, then size to accommodate enough guests for us to cover our costs — this is a non-profit venture — and then the factor of the most exciting venue for the guests comes into play,” Zimmerman said.
Some galleries will be open for viewing the night of the ball, including “Loop,” by Jennifer Steinkamp and Jimmy Johnson, an installation at the gallery until April 20.
The event traditionally draws high attendance from SFS and College students, while numbers from the School of Nursing and Health Studies and the McDonough School of Business lag. Similar demographics are expected this year, which Carrasco says is common sense.
“Yes, it’s mainly SFS and College because we do invite diplomats. … So, it’s a big party, everyone dresses up, it’s a formal, but it’s also a chance to network,” Carrasco said.
“People who want to come usually find a way of coming, so we don’t feel the need to kind of greatly go about diversifying. I think we always try to make it a campus-wide event.”
However, students may be deterred by the high price tag of the nonprofit ball.
Anna Stone (COL ’15) has attended Dip Ball since her freshman year, but only gratis courtesy of her boyfriend’s involvement in the SFS Academic Council. She says having to pay full price for tickets would definitely deter her.
“Especially because Dip Ball happens so close to Senior Ball, and a lot of seniors go to Dip Ball, you’re buying basically two $100 tickets. … Especially when you think about girls, they don’t want to wear the same dress twice,” Stone said.
Though Dip Ball may face challenges such as a high price tag and competition with attendees to the Spring Kickoff Concert, which is being held on campus the same night, it certainly isn’t a Georgetown tradition that is going anywhere.
“The Diplomatic Ball is a great chance to network. You go, it’s very formal, but at the same time it’s informal. You get to meet people that you wouldn’t normally meet,” Carrasco said.

The Global Human Development program, one of eight master’s programs in the School of Foreign Service, will establish its first endowed chair after receiving a $4 million donation from The Coca-Cola Foundation, announced April 2.
The GHD program, founded in fall 2012, will graduate its first class of 21 this spring.
The first occupant of the chair will be Steven Radelet, who is currently Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Development at Georgetown University. Radelet formerly served as Chief Economist for the U.S. Agency for International Development.
“[Radelet] will occupy the chair, and he will teach courses primarily in the Global Human Development program. And he’s quite a prolific scholar, so he will also publish,” SFS Acting Dean James Reardon-Anderson said.
The Coca-Cola Foundation has made a large impact on the SFS over the last 20 years: from supporting minority students in the Master of Science in Foreign Service program to supporting the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.
Anne DeVine (GRD ’14) spent last summer in Istanbul working for various partnerships in development, including Every Drop Matters — a partnership between The Coca-Cola Company and the United Nations Development Programme.
“Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola’s CEO, established the concept of the Golden Triangle, the idea that civil society, government and the private sector need to work together in order to make development initiatives work,” DeVine said. “And I think that resonated with me and I saw that happening on the ground.”
DeVine, who spent seven years working with NGOs on education and youth issues, was excited about the newly established GHD chair.
“It’s valuable to academia in general, but I think the thing that’s really important about this specific chair is the recognition for the need for this type of program,” DeVine said.
The program addresses current global development issues and aims to produce the next generation of policy leaders and activists. Reardon-Anderson emphasized Dean Carol Lancaster’s (SFS ’64) role in both the founding of the GHD and the creation of the chair, which will be one of 12 to 15 endowed chairs across the master’s programs in the SFS.
“This is entirely Dean Lancaster’s project. She was really the creator of the Global Human Development program,” Reardon-Anderson said of Lancaster, whose resignation was announced this week following a medical leave of absence. “And then she went out and arranged for this very generous gift from The Coca-Cola Foundation. … So this was really her project from beginning to end and unfortunately she was not there to witness the celebration.”
SFS Director of Outreach Gail Griffith, who served as lead writer on the grant proposal, also credited GHD Director Ann Van Dusen for the program’s overall success.
“The persons who deserve all of the credit for the creation of the chair and the establishment of the program in Global Human Development are Dean Carol Lancaster and professor Ann Van Dusen, respectively,” Griffith said.
Reardon-Anderson added that the chair will be named for former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and current Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy Donald F. McHenry after his retirement.
“Our SFS faculty, Ambassador Donald McHenry, who is on the Coca-Cola Board, was instrumental in shepherding this grant application through to fruition,” Griffith said. “Ambassador McHenry himself donated funds, along with SFS alums Amre Youness (SFS ’84) and Caroline Heinz-Youness (SFS ’84), to complement the monies needed to establish the chair.” Youness and Heinz-Youness also serve as members of the Campaign for Georgetown Executive Council.

The Georgetown Program Board’s Spring Kickoff Concert — featuring Big Sean, White Panda and two student DJs, Tate Tucker and Keylow — starts tonight at 10 p.m. in McDonough Arena. The concert is open to the general public, but Georgetown students earn a $15 student discount.
The GPB concert will be the kickoff to Big Sean’s college tour, which includes events at the University of Maryland and Pennsylvania State University. Calvin Harris and Wiz Khalifa performed during the last two spring concerts, respectively.
The planning process for the concert began in early November when the concert committee received the concert’s official date and budget.
“We tried to get Harbin Field, but the only date that we could do it, Relay for Life had already booked the field,” GPB Vice Chair Kevin Phelan (MSB ’16) said. “Between various athletic activities, this was the only weekend available for McDonough Arena.”
The committee reached out to a middleman, who presented a list of artists available at the time of the concert. According to Phelan, the committee looked for artists who would be interesting for students and active in the spring. GPB Vice Chair Andrew Minkovitz (SFS ’17) said the board looked into holding the concert at 2 Chainz’s 9:30 Club performance, which was scheduled for two weeks before the GPB concert.
However, a clause prevented GPB from having an open concert that allowed attendees other than Georgetown students at the 2 Chainz venue.
“We need to sell out to break even, so restricting our attendance would not have been ideal,” Minkovitz said.
The committee chose hip-hop artist Big Sean, who released his second studio album “Hall of Fame” in August 2013. Minkovitz also had the idea to reach out to White Panda, an electronic duo that is known for mashups and remixes like “Midnight City.”
“I’ve heard a lot of good things about either Big Sean or White Panda,” Minkovitz said. “People are usually interested, if not in one, then the other. I thought White Panda would be good because they’re not a pure electronic act. They’re mashup artists who deal with hip-hop and other genres as well.”
According to Phelan, student interest in the concert is high, although some students are unfamiliar with the performers.
“Big Sean would be cool to see, but I hadn’t heard of White Panda until now,” Joshua Davis (COL ’17) said.
However, even students who are unfamiliar with the artists are still interested in attending.
“I don’t know that many songs by Big Sean, but I know him, and it would be fun,” Jennifer Holloway (COL ’16) said.
Others expressed disappointment with ticket costs: $20 for Georgetown students and $35 for non-students. Last year’s concert required a valid GOCard for entry.
“We deserve more of a student discount, though, since most concerts with artists like [Big Sean] are $20 anyway,” Davis said.
A date conflict with the Diplomatic Ball has also posed problems for GBP during the planning process.
“Unfortunately, the date conflict was unavoidable [dependent on the availability of McDonough Gym]. Obviously, we were never planning on having that happen,” Phelan said. “I think I’ve seen people say both ways, that they’re missing Diplomatic Ball for the spring concert and vice versa, and overall, there’s enough interest in both.”
Despite these roadblocks, the concert is almost sold out.
“We have some more tickets to sell, but not that many anymore, after this past week,” Minkovitz said.
Overall, planning has gone relatively smoothly in light of last year’s challenges. During the fall of 2012, GPB conducted a poll to gauge student interest in prospective artists; the eventual performer, Calvin Harris, was not on the list.
“The way we got Calvin Harris was so hectic and last-minute, so we tried to revise things this year,” Phelan said. “Even before we got our budget, we looked at interest within the [GPB] group. By joining, you were able to have a say and express your interest for genre and potential artists.”
However, this year’s logistical challenges remain formidable.
“We’ve had multiple meetings with a lot of heads of departments going over details that I hadn’t even considered, like where to put DPS, how many porta-potties to place and how to coordinate a potential evacuation,” Phelan said.
For those on GPB, the day of the concert will certainly be a long one.
“Our day on Friday starts at 7:15 in the morning, and we’ll be volunteering until 4 a.m. on Saturday,” Minkovitz said.

The generalization of colleges as being bastions of liberalism is a stereotype that’s here to stay at 37th and O streets.
A March 28 Gallup poll indicated a growth in youth identifying an affinity for the Democratic Party, currently resting at 53 percent. The Democratic Party’s attraction to students is no novelty, with Georgetown boasting a robust presence of college Democrats. But with the stuttered rollout of the Affordable Care Act’s and President Obama’s apparent mishandling of environmental issues, the poll flies in the face of critics claiming that Democrats are losing touch with their largest demographic: young voters.
By the measure of emails sent out to interested students, the College Democrats, which sent out emails to over 2,000 students, is the largest group on campus. The group also over 100 leadership positions. In comparison, the College Republicans’ Listserv numbers around 1,000 students.
According to the College Democrats, the size of these groups reflects the overall political alignment of Georgetown students.
“I think the fact that we do have the largest group on campus does tell a lot about where people’s political beliefs lie,” College Democrats Treasurer Anirudha Vaddadi (SFS ’16) said.
College Republicans members attribute the discrepancy in popularity to the character of a university.
“I think by nature, universities are liberal institutions. … That’s been a trend forever, as long as I know of. It doesn’t surprise me in that way that Georgetown is liberal,” College Republicans Vice-Chair Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16) said. “In general, I think the university as an institution often times has a liberal population, whether that’s undergraduates, graduates, professors.”
According to McNaughton, the university’s Jesuit identity additionally adds to its perceived liberal atmosphere.
“I would say that, if anything, Georgetown being Jesuit — not specifically Catholic, just Jesuit — has an influence just because of the Jesuit focus on social justice issues that often steer people more to the left,” McNaughton said.
However, according to College Democrats Chair Chandini Jha (COL ’16), this perceived liberal atmosphere is because of progressive ideas that align with changing social values among students.
“I think the issue really is just the social construction of things like marriage equality and women’s rights that attract more people to the Democrats as being the more progressive party on those issues,” Jha said.
Although College Republicans recognize the predominance of liberals on campus, members see a potential shift in the campus’s alignment.
“I think that college students on margin will always trend toward the more liberal persuasion; however I expect there to be a resurgence in young conservatism in the next few years, as we see the effects of the current administration,” College Republicans Chair Patrick Musgrave (COL ’16) wrote in an email.
McNaughton additionally felt that the effects of current political occurrences may shift political alignment in the future.
“When implications of Obamacare and the Social Security structure that is going to hurt our age group the most right now, I think that when those realities start to hit in, certainly the young republicans will definitely expand,” McNaughton said.
However, if the political alignment of members on campus grows in the future, College Republicans do not necessarily feel the size of the group would accurately reflect the conservative presence on campus.
“Maybe our particular group won’t grow, but across campus it will be more common to run into conservatives,” McNaughton said.
For both groups, size causes difficulties. For example, the large size of the Democrats leads to some difficulties in keeping a close-knit atmosphere.
“Our big issue in the club is just making sure that we can connect all our members in a way that makes it feel like a community,” Jha said. “A byproduct of our success is that we want to have the community feel of a smaller club.”
College Democrats are also careful about not speaking for their diverse and large group.
“We don’t want to speak for all of our members, given that we are such a big club, so that’s something that we are very aware of and try to be careful of,” Jha said.
For the College Republicans, the small size of their group does not restrict their liberty in programming and presenting their views.
“I don’t think there’s any substantial inequality in terms of what we are able to program for or in terms of being able to hold enough events,” McNaughton said.
However, as the smaller group, College Republicans face more voices ready to challenge their policies.
“I think maybe there’s more outspoken disagreement with some of our policies with the Republican Party on campus, but it doesn’t affect my engagement in the organization,” McNaughton said.
Students did seem to identify a lean toward the left among the student body.
“I think the College Democrats are probably more present on campus just because I feel like the student body itself is composed of more liberal leaning students,” Joey Shive (COL ’17) said. “College students are very focused on social atmosphere, and I feel that liberals tend to put that out there a lot more so it’s just a very activist atmosphere and a lot of those people are fighting for, it’s not necessarily a financial perspective, it’s more like a social opinion.”
Thomas Massad (COL ’17) concurred, attributing this appearance to marketing.
“I feel the College Democrats more on campus through the means of social media and through the means of more extensive flyering around campus, and in that way they are more visible to me in my day-to-day activity,” Massad said. “We have such a young population and I think peoples’ political views are more outwardly expressed and I see in my day-to-day interactions with other people and day-to day activity around campus, generally more liberal outspoken viewpoints as opposed to outspoken conservative viewpoints.”
