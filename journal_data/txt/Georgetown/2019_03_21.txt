An online petition calling for Georgetown University to revoke the degrees and admission of all current and former students involved in the college admissions bribery scheme has gained 16,691 signatures as of press time.
Georgetown alumnus and admissions interviewer Mickey Lee (COL ’05) tweeted the petition March 13. The petition refers to a U.S. Department of Justice indictment of 50 parents and athletic coaches involved in an admissions bribery scheme, where parents bribed athletic coaches at eight selective universities to secure their children’s admission. 
The March 12 indictment charged former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst with accepting $2.7 million in bribes for fraudulently recruiting 12 applicants for competitive tennis teams. The indictment also named five Georgetown parents. 
The scandal reveals the inequality in the admissions process, according to Lee.
“People can definitely buy their way legally into the school or make it very favorable to the admissions process by donating enough money to buy a building and having it in their name,” Lee said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I think it sucks, but that’s just the nature of it, but this is so obviously and blatantly illegal.”
The petition comes after the University of Southern California rescinded the admission of six students implicated in the scandal March 14, according to The Washington Post. Georgetown has the opportunity to lead other institutions involved in the scheme by quickly revoking admission and the degrees, according to Lee.
“If we take action, I think we can set the standard instead of just waiting for Stanford to do something or USC to do something. I think that we should be the first to do it to show that, you know, we are serious about this and we want to clear our name and we want to show the world that our university means business and we’re clean, you know, to the extent that we can be,” Lee said. “The world is really watching.”
The university will not comment on any disciplinary action against the students who were allegedly admitted to Georgetown with fraudulent applications because of protections offered by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill. FERPA is a federal law that protects the confidentiality of student education records.
The university is committed to equitable admissions and will take action if necessary, University President John J. DeGioia wrote in a March 15 campuswide email.  
“Now that the government’s investigation has detailed the extent of the alleged fraud, we are reviewing the indictment and will take appropriate action,” DeGioia wrote. “We have no indication that any other Georgetown employees were involved.”
The university also disclosed that it had enacted measures in December 2018 to mitigate fraud for student-athlete applicants, including restrictions on gifts and fundraising as well as audits to determine whether recruited student-athletes appear on rosters, according to a FAQ page posted on the university website. The university has also hired a third party to conduct an audit of athletic recruiting and make recommendations about how to adjust admissions policies. 
Georgetown said it discovered irregularities in Ernst’s recruitment practices and put him on leave in December 2017, but that the university did not know of his criminal conduct until it was contacted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in November 2018.
Ernst received a positive recommendation from the university’s athletic director, Lee Reed, in July 2018. Any statements following Ernst’s resignation only endorsed his athletic performance, according to university spokesperson Meghan Dubyak.
“It was widely known that Mr. Ernst had been on leave since December 2017 and had not been permitted to coach students since that time,” Dubyak wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Any statement Georgetown made after asking him to resign focused on his athletic record only.”
Enrolled students Isabelle Henriquez (COL ’20)  and Adam Semprevivo (COL ’20), whose parents are charged in the indictment, are currently not listed in the student directory. Hill did not specify why Henriquez and Semprevivo are no longer included. (Full disclosure: Semprevivo formerly served as the cartoonist for The Hoya.)
“The university strives to protect the privacy of community members, so there are a variety of reasons personal information may not be visible in the contact directory,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Appearing in the directory is optional.”
Henriquez and Semprevivo were not available for comment at the time of press.
Though Lee’s petition calls for the university to rescind the admissions and degrees of all students involved in the scandal, different disciplinary action should be taken against students who knew of their parent’s fraudulent acts and those who were unaware of their parents involvement in the scam, according to Laura Arenas (COL ’22), who signed the petition.
“For the people who already graduated and whether they knew or not, I think it’s harder to say, because they did complete the work that is necessary to gain a degree from Georgetown, and if they didn’t know their parents were doing that, then they’re not really at fault,” Arena said. “It’s kind of complicated when it comes to rescinding degrees, but I think at the very least there should be some sort of definite action against the girl who was still here and knew about what her parent’s actions were.”
Students involved in such schemes deprive others who might better deserve admission from the opportunity to attend selective colleges, according to admitted student Yalda Zarrabi, who currently attends Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Md.
“People work for these specific universities so hard for four years to get into them and they’re some really deserving people, and kids who were involved in this scandal are kind of taking away the spots of people who have worked really, really hard,” Zarrabi said.

Student group Outdoor Education appealed for $3,800 more in funds after expressing safety concerns over training during the Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriations Committee’s deliberations on the final budget plan March 17.
The committee held a public appeals session on March 13 and 17. Of the 13 student groups or boards FinApp funds, six appealed their allotments for the upcoming academic year. These groups included the Center for Social Justice advisory board for student organizations, the Student Activities Commission, Georgetown Program Board, the advisory board for club sports and performing arts advisory council.
FinApp, which is made up of 12 GUSA senators, allocates money to seven advisory boards, the Georgetown Program Board, the Georgetown University Lecture Fund and the GUSA executive. Each of these applicants had the opportunity to present proposed budgets in front of the committee at the Feb. 24 FinApp summit.
At the March 17 session’s end, where FinApp approved the final budget, the most significant percentage cuts were experienced by Outdoor Education, the performing arts council, GUSA and SAC. Outdoor Education ultimately received a final budget of $7,000, a 43 percent reduction from the group’s initial request. The final budget for the performing arts council was 33.3 percent less than requested, and GUSA received an allotment 93 percent less than initially requested.
The decision is still pending approval by the full senate and GUSA President Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) at a meeting scheduled for March 24, according to FinApp Chair Hayley Grande (COL ’21). 
After tabling budget discussions on March 13, senators reconvened Sunday. As most of the $1,092,000 budget had already been drafted during Feb. 27 deliberations, the March 17 discussion focused mainly on an appeal for a budget increase by Outdoor Education, a student group that holds trips throughout the year including skiing, hiking, biking and backpacking.
Representatives from Outdoor Education Ellen Bannon (SFS ’19) and Will Thacher (COL ’19) attended the committee session to appeal for more funding. While Bannon and Thacher agreed to cut their funding request for gear, including replacing hiking packs, tents and water filtration systems, by 50 percent, they made several cases for an increased budget to fund training for guides and subsidization for trips.
Funding would prohibit guides from being properly licensed and trained, raising safety concerns for students, Thacher said. 
“Training is just a cost that we can’t get around, but the guides need to be trained to lead kids in the field, mostly for reasons of safety,” Thacher said. “If we don’t get the money that we requested for training, it’s just going to impact other parts of the program.”
GUSA senator Karan Chauhan (SFS ’22) advocated for meeting at least part of Outdoor Education’s appeal for $3,800, citing the funding’s ability to promote equal access to the climbing team and making the activity safer.
“We’re also looking to make sure that activities aren’t cost-prohibitive to people who participate in them, and what I got from their presentation is more that the cuts would fall on the guides who need to go through these trainings,” Chauhan said.
Chauhan suggested allotting an additional $1,500 to Outdoor Education, moving $500 from the performing arts council, SAC and GUSA to Outdoor Education,. Though this represents an increase from the initial draft, Outdoor Education ultimately still saw its requested budget decrease by 43 percent.
Outdoor Education’s budget cuts come amid significant cuts to the Georgetown Opportunities for  Leadership Development and performing arts council. The $4,000 more dollars granted to club sports at the first appeals meeting drew $1,000 from the GOLD budget and $3,000 from that of performing arts council.
The CSJ advisory board also gained $14,980 during appeals that came from cuts to media board, the performing arts council, GUSA and GOLD. The committee cited CSJ advisory board’s cut into reserve funds in previous years and the need for funds to expand programming for the group.
The performing arts council lost 17.8 percent of its allocation between the draft budget and the end of appeals.
To provide Outdoor Education with the $1,500 increase, senators suggested drawing from other organizations, including the performing arts council, SAC, GUSA, GPB and the Campus Ministry Student Forum.

Two college students and two parents filed a class action lawsuit against Georgetown University on March 15, alleging monetary harm after revelations that applicants were fraudulently admitted to the university.
The suit follows an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice uncovering a service that parents used beginning around 2011 to bribe athletic coaches and administrators of standardized tests to guarantee their children admission to elite universities. The investigation’s findings, which indicted 50 parents and athletic officials, were announced March 12.
Gordon Ernst, the former Georgetown men’s and women’s head tennis coach, was charged for accepting bribes to fraudulently designate select students as athletic recruits to fast-track their admission.
The lawsuit, which targets the eight universities involved in the larger bribery scheme, claims an unfair admissions process emotionally and economically damaged the students who were rejected from Georgetown. Students paid application fees, for which Georgetown charges $75, to join an unequal application process, according to the complaint.
“Each of the admissions processes at these universities was tainted by corruption, such that those parents with children who had mediocre grades and test scores were allowed admission based upon the amount of bribery money they paid university insiders,” the complaint reads.
Georgetown is invested in ensuring a fair admissions process, according to University Spokesperson Matt Hill.
“While we do not comment on pending litigation, Georgetown University takes the integrity of our admissions process seriously and is committed to a fair, holistic process whereby each application is carefully reviewed,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We review all applicants without consideration of a family’s financial consideration or ability to pay.”
The operation was spearheaded by William Singer, a college consultant who used his nonprofit, the Key Worldwide Foundation, to pay bribes, according to the indictment.
In addition to Georgetown, the college students are suing Stanford University, Yale University and Wake Forest University. Singer, who allegedly received $25 million from 32 parents to facilitate the scheme, is also named a defendant.
The lawsuit is unlikely to win settlement funds from Georgetown because it has a high bar to prove the university was complicit, according to J. Peter Byrne, a professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center.
“This case can prevail against Georgetown only if higher ups at Georgetown knew or should have known about the cheating,” Byrne wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The plaintiffs’ lawyers reveal no knowledge of this and likely are fishing for lucky evidence and a settlement to make them go away.”
Should the college students win the case, all individuals who were rejected from any of the colleges involved in the alleged scheme between 2012 and 2018 would be eligible to receive the funds, according to the complaint. 
Stanford students Erica Olsen and Kalea Woods originally filed a class action suit against the universities on March 14. The case was voluntarily and permanently dismissed without prejudice on March 15, meaning it could be refiled, and was done so without Woods as a plaintiff.
The argument of the new case is largely similar to the previous case, but different individuals are suing the universities. The lawsuit no longer alleges that the value of academic degrees for students who were admitted to the universities named in the indictment have been devalued.
Georgetown is committed to fairness in its admissions process, University President John J. DeGioia wrote in a campuswide email March 15.
“Our longstanding policies of need-blind admissions and meet-full-need financial aid, our partnerships with programs such as the Cristo Rey Network, a network of Catholic high schools in underserved communities, and our programs that provide opportunities and support to our first-generation and low-income students advance a foundational commitment to equity and access for all members of our community,” DeGioia wrote.
The suit comes after a petition by Micky Lee (COL ’05), a former instructor for Georgetown’s Tae Kwon Do club, called for the university to rescind all degrees granted to students involved in the admissions scheme. The petition, which has earned 16,252 signatures as of press time, requests the university take such action to maintain its reputation.
“I implore the administration to rescind admissions and any degrees conferred to all students involved in this scandal,” the petition reads. “In addition, a written public apology needs to be made to all university alumni and students as well as applicants/families of those who were deferred or not admitted at these cheaters’ expense.”

While there are many reasons to sue Georgetown, I have a hard believing the current plaintiffs aren’t anything but hypocrites after attention and money considering they never sued the university for the unequal and unfair admissions process related to affirmative action.  It’s a fact that if you’re of a a certain racial group, you don’t have to achieve the grades and test scores other racial groups have to achieve to gain admissions.  That is even more worth suing over.  So I don’t care if they win.  But I hope it costs them and the university a lot of money.

If anyone should be suing for unfair processes, it should be ATHLETES who were snubbed by the corrupt coaches during their recruiting processes.  The plaintiffs of this lawsuit demonstrate their complete and utter lack of reading comprehension abilities, as this scandal has nothing to do with any student who was “unfairly rejected”.  No “normal” student spot was lost due to those bribing their way in; the spots were already reserved for athletes who would have contributed to, in Georgetown’s case, the tennis team.

Daughter applied. Daughter denied entry. I suspect rejection was base on her “supporting writing” that identified her as living/growing as a military children. Hard to believe  that her acceptance into the school was probably lost to someone bribing their way in.

A bill raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 passed the Maryland House of Delegates and Senate this week and awaits the approval of Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R). 
The proposed legislation intends to raise the minimum wage initially to $12.50 from the current $10.10 by 2022, and later increase the wage to $15 by 2025. 
The initial bills, sponsored by Del. Diana Fennell (D-Prince George’s) in the Maryland House and Sen. Cory McCray (D-Baltimore City) in the Maryland Senate respectively, were resolved into a single bill after the convention of a conference committee. The resolved House bill passed in the Maryland House 96-44 on March 1 and in the Maryland Senate 32-15 on March 14.
Before voting on final passage of the bill, both chambers voted on several different amendments to the legislation. Amendments ranged from making geographical tiers for implementation of the bill to easing requirements for small businesses. In the end, none of the proposed amendments were adopted, according to The Washington Post. 
An increase in the minimum wage will help local workers support themselves and their families, but may pose difficulties for small businesses, according to Maryland resident and Georgetown student Zahraa Hotait (NHS ’22). Policymakers should work to strike a balance between the interests of business owners and Maryland employees, Hotait said. 
“I worked in a restaurant throughout high school and witnessed many of the hardworking servers struggling to support themselves or their families, even while holding multiple jobs,” Hotait wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “However, the community where I live in Maryland deeply values its small town cafés and independent shops, and it may be difficult for these establishments to survive at such a significant increase in wages for their staff.” 
The bill’s passage in both chambers also came after negotiations with Hogan (R), who wants to raise the minimum wage to just $12.10 by 2022, according to the Washington Post.
In a letter to the Maryland House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert), Hogan asked to delay the measure past 2022 in order to allow the neighboring states to increase their minimum wages and offset Maryland losses if the bill were to be enacted, according to The Washington Post.
Critics of the bill, along with Hogan, argue that the increase in the minimum wage would reduce Maryland’s competitiveness with surrounding states, according to Capital News Service, a University of Maryland College Park news agency. Currently, both Virginia and Pennsylvania have $7.25 minimum wages and West Virginia and Delaware have $8.75 minimum wages. In contrast to its neighbors, Washington, D.C., has a minimum wage of $13.25, though the minimum wage is supposed to rise to $14 on July 1, 2019, and again to $15 in 2020.
Despite Hogan’s request to wait for the surrounding states to meet a combined 80 percent of Maryland’s wage to implement the second phase of the bill, both chambers of Maryland’s state government passed the measure. 
Hogan’s stance on the bill’s current form and whether he intends to veto it remain unclear. Democrats do, however, hold enough seats in both chambers to override a veto, should Hogan decide to reject the legislation. Under Maryland’s constitution, Hogan has 30 days to choose to veto the legislation, or the bill will be implemented.
Roughly two out of three Marylanders wanted to raise the minimum wage to $15, according to a recent Goucher College poll. The same poll also found a majority of Maryland voters supported legalizing marijuana recreationally, raising the minimum age for tobacco sales to 21, banning the use of styrofoam in the state and passing the proposed “aid-in-dying” legislation. 
The push to increase minimum wage comes amid other progressive policies in Maryland chambers, such as legalizing recreational marijuana and banning 3D printed guns, as Democrats were able to increase their majorities in both chambers in the most recent elections in 2018, according to The Baltimore Sun. 
Maryland’s efforts to raise the minimum wage comes after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) push to raise the minimum wage to $15 in 2016. Critics of Bowser’s proposal cited the complicated system of wages for employees who receive tips in the District. Despite these criticisms, the District passed legislation to raise their minimum wage to $15 by 2020.
If implemented, Maryland would join a growing number of states who have recently raised their minimum wages to $15. In addition to D.C., California, Massachusetts and New York all have measures to raise their minimum wages by 2022, 2023 and 2021, respectively.

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority plans to double the number of trains at approximately 12 stations to increase service amid historical lows in Metro ridership.
There will be no fare increases or service cuts in other areas despite these extended service proposals. The proposal is part of a preliminary $3.4 billion budget for the fiscal year 2020, beginning in June, that was preliminarily approved by the Metro board on March 14.
The goal of the budget is to increase service on the Red and Yellow lines and promote use of the metro, which is at its lowest ridership level since 2000, according to WAMU, Washington, D.C.’s primary NPR station. The Metro averaged 595,000 users per week in the second half of 2018, a significant drop from almost 752,000 average weekday rides in 2008, according to WAMU.
The Yellow line would also be extended to Greenbelt, currently the last stop on the Green line, instead of Fort Totten or Mount Vernon Square. The Red line would cease turnbacks at Silver Spring, instead extending the line from Glenmont to Shady Grove.
Though extending the Yellow line will cost upwards of $8 million, the agency expects costs to be somewhat offset by 1.7 million new trips annually, according to The Washington Post. Similarly, the Red line extension would cost approximately $3.1 million, while leading to about 600,000 new trips per year. 
The drafted budget is set to be voted on during Metro’s full board meeting March 28. 
Under the new budget, the price of SelectPass, the current unlimited monthly rail pass option, would drop from $17.50 to $15. Of the proposed budget, $2 billion is set aside for operating costs, while the other $1.4 billion will be used for capital funding and system improvements, according to a Jan. 16 news release by Metro, which contained a draft of the budget proposal.
Metro is committed to investing money into improving equipment and Metro stations to improve safety and reliability, according to the news release.
“Metro’s Capital Budget invests $1.4 billion into safety and reliability improvements, rebuilding the Metro system, and improving the effectiveness of the current rail and bus network,” the news release said. “This includes modernization of the fare collection equipment; station renovations like brighter lights, new platforms and escalator replacements; parking garage rehabilitations, and other customer improvements.” 
A potential proposal for the budget would have restored late night services, which were abolished after the agency’s SafeTrack construction effort in 2016, an accelerated building program which sought to renovate railways after numerous safety lapses.
The proposal was ultimately left out of the budget because the Federal Transit Administration threatened to withhold federal funding if Metro restored late night services. Additionally, adhering to current service times will allow preventative maintenance work to continue. 
To compensate for the lack of late night services, Metro proposed to subsidize ride-share services such as Uber and Lyft for late night city workers.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) criticized the idea during her March 18 State of the District speech. Ride-share subsidies are not an adequate substitute for reinstituting late night services, Bowser said in the March 18 speech.
Other proposals missing from the budget include an effort to increase trains to their maximum length of eight cars at all times to boost capacity and an expansion of the peak fare hours during weekdays, according to The Washington Post.
Originally, board members also proposed a $2 flat-fare on Saturdays and Sundays, fixing the cost for all regardless of distance, according to The Washington Post. This action, however, did not make the proposal that was voted last Thursday.
