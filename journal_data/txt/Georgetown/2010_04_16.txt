Despite an ever-changing climate for the news business, an old mainstay – print journalism – was in the spotlight Sunday, when four Washington Post writers received Pulitzer Prizes, the most awards of any American newspaper.
Gene Weingarten won his second Pulitzer Prize in feature writing. He writes a humor column for the Post, but he won the Pulitzer for a feature about parents forgetting their children in cars, thereby causing premature death.
“You feel very lucky, because the process is a complicated committee process and sometimes you feel as though winning is a crapshoot,” Weingarten said of winning twice.
He last won in 2008 for “Pearls Before Breakfast,” a feature story in the Post that reported on a famous classical violinist who played at L’Enfant Plaza as an experiment to see if people would stop and recognize beautiful music in their busy morning commute.
“I write a lot of different things. There could be nothing more different between a humor column and the one [that] won this year,” he said. “They are [different], but they address [a] fundamental part of the human condition.”
Three other Washington Post writers earned recognition in a variety of categories. Anthony Shadid won for international reporting for a series about U.S. troops leaving Iraq, his second award in the category. He also garnered a Pulitzer in 2004 for coverage of the U.S. invasion into and subsequent occupation of Iraq. Kathleen Parker was awarded a Pulitzer in the commentary category for her long-running conservative-leaning column. Sarah Kaufman received recognition in the criticism category for her dance column, which she has written for the Post since 1996.
Other prizes in journalism were given to The Seattle Times staff for breaking news reporting, Michael Moss and members of The New York Times staff for explanatory reporting, and Matt Richtel and members of The New York Times staff for national reporting, among others.
The Pulitzer Prize is awarded nationally each year for excellence in journalism, letters, drama and music at the recommendation of the Pulitzer Prize Board.

Following the example set by their West Georgetown counterparts, many of the university’s Burleith neighbors banded together in an effort to chip away at the possible passage of Georgetown’s 2010 Campus Plan.
In an editorial featured in this month’s Burleith Bell, members of the Burleith Citizens’ Association called residents to action and established the “Burleith Community Fund” as a way of dissuading the D.C. Zoning Commission from giving the Campus Plan the green light.
The editorial expressed particular concern over Georgetown’s plan to increase the size of the graduate and professional programs by 3,000 students. The university does not plan to add more on-campus undergraduate housing, although the university’s planners have located sites on campus where 800 more students could live. The university also plans to build a new and expanded hospital, which will affect traffic.
The plan outlines how the university and the hospital should expand in the next 10 years. It states that 120 of the new graduate students will reside in a housing complex within the block of 37th and 36th Streets between N and Prospect Streets, but the BCA believes that many more will likely live off campus in Burleith.
The Citizens’ Association of Georgetown has also voiced concerns over the Campus Plan, primarily over the disruptive behavior of students living off campus. Last month, CAG launched a campaign called “Save Our Neighborhood” targeted at the number of Georgetown students living off campus. Neighbors are angered by the excessive noise, trash, vandalism and safety violations committed by students.
The BCA, on the other hand, recognized that students play a constructive role in the community in its editorial, and is grateful for their contributions. The editorial also stated, however, that there have been displeasing incidents regarding students living off campus and that the university should provide more on-campus housing.
“As a community, we cannot ignore the well-documented incidents of irresponsible behavior by some university students who have lived or currently live in Burleith,” the editorial said. “We must also recognize the university’s ongoing failure to provide adequate on-campus housing options or incentives for many of its students, as well as adequate instruction and support to its students living off campus about property maintenance and noise control.”
Allie Barry (SFS ’12), a student who will be living off campus next year, said she believes that additional on-campus housing will not stop students from going off campus.
“I understand the concern of homeowners in Burleith, and I am glad that they recognize that not all students are the same,” Barry said. “That being said, the university is an integral part of the neighborhood, and with the university comes students who do not stay within the campus gates. Students will continue to go out on weekends regardless of a new housing plan or not, so there has to be some compromise here between the residents and the university.”
The BCA plans to hold a community meeting about the Campus Plan on April 21, and a meeting with Georgetown officials on April 26.”

Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) addressed the College Democrats and other members of the Georgetown community on the prospect of D.C. residents obtaining a voting representative in the near future Tuesday evening.
Currently in her 10th term as the District’s congressional representative, Norton has put the fight for voting rights in D.C. at the top of her agenda during her time in Congress.
The District of Columbia does not currently have a vote in either congressional chamber, similar to that of the U.S. territories such as Guam and Puerto Rico, with the exception that the citizens in D.C. pay federal taxes.
Norton, like her counterparts from U.S. territories, is a recognized member of the House of Representatives where she is able to be a voting member of the various committees in the House; she cannot, however, vote on the floor when the House convenes. She announced Tuesday that the struggle for representation was almost over.
“We are on the verge, and this time we really are, of finally getting this bill through both houses,” Norton said.
The bill Norton refers to is the D.C. Voting Rights Act of 2009 that has already passed through the Senate and now waits for a vote in the House. As of late, the legislation has been stalled by debate over the Ensign Amendment, introduced by Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) in February 2009, which proposes to alter the gun laws in the District. Despite this setback, Norton insisted that the time to achieve representation is now.
“We have got to go to the House floor soon. We have what can only be called a dwindling majority. We lost our 60 votes. We may lose more in the Senate,” Norton said.
Invoking the history of the American Revolution, Norton went on to describe the District’s long struggle for representation and how this struggle has centered on the same slogan that first sparked the fight for American independence – “no taxation without representation.”
In addition, the congresswoman expressed strong dissatisfaction that men and women from D.C. serve in the U.S. armed forces and lose their lives overseas while at the same time lack representation at home. She told of the continued “indignity” that her constituents are paid as people in Baghdad have received representation before citizens of D.C.
A native of Ward Six and a graduate of the D.C. Public School system, Raahiyl Briscoe (COL ’12) attended the event to hear Norton speak about an issue that affects her more than most Georgetown students. Voicing support for Norton’s efforts, Briscoe insisted that many reforms need to take place in the District, especially in the education system.
“Having been a graduate of D.C.’s public schools, a lot needs to be done. I’m all for [Norton] and her efforts,” Briscoe said.
Norton spent the latter half of the event calling for Democrats to re-examine their position and to prepare for a battle at the polls in November. Citing the recent Democratic losses in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races and Massachusetts Senate race, Norton advised Democrats to recognize the reality of the fight at hand.
“The votes in Virginia, New Jersey and even progressive Massachusetts – all Obama states – should sober drunk Democrats, drunk still with the inauguration, still flying balloons. If those three losses don’t sober us before 2010 there will not be a Democratic House, and there will not be a Democratic Senate,” Norton said.
Norton went on to discuss the electoral run of President Obama and praised the efforts of students across the nation as being the backbone of support for his campaign. Terming Obama’s rise to the Oval Office the “Obama movement,” Norton maintained that November’s midterm elections would reveal whether or not the movement was real and vital or just a passing phenomenon.”

Georgetown administrators and faculty members are taking a new approach in their efforts to seek mandatory university re-accreditation, focusing on topics such as institutional and student assessment.
Although Georgetown has been an accredited institution since 1921 through the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the MSCHE requires its 522 members to renew accreditation every 10 years. Accreditation is a quality-assurance mechanism for educational institutions in which they undergo evaluation by a third-party agency.
Despite a lengthy assessment process, accreditation is worth the effort because it enhances the worth of a Georgetown degree, according to Marjory Blumenthal, associate provost for academics, who co-chairs the steering committee for Georgetown’s re-accreditation.
“How did I know you didn’t just buy that diploma? It’s quality assurance, in that sense,” she said. “It is the Good Housekeeping stamp of approval for universities.”
Re-accreditation in 2012 guarantees continued federal financial aid for students.
“Financial aid [is] a big issue for getting the best students, some of whom don’t have the means,” Blumenthal said. “[Re-accreditation is] a mechanical set of tasks, but it’s very important.”
The MSCHE – one of the nation’s seven nonprofit accrediting agencies that is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education – outlines 14 standards that all member institutions must meet in order to be accredited. Among them are institutional integrity, student support services and educational offerings.
While most MSCHE member institutions opt to do a “comprehensive self-study” of all 14 standards for their re-accreditation, Georgetown administrators are instead concentrating on four.
“What we’ve decided to do was more focused,” Blumenthal said of the university’s self-study. “We’ve determined that [after studying] other institutions that are like us in important ways . we would do something that wasn’t comprehensive.”
Blumenthal said the process, called “Selective Topics,” is a relatively new approach to re-accreditation. After Georgetown submits initial documentation that the university meets 10 of the 14 requirements and it is confirmed by MSCHE officials and administrators from other member institutions, the steering committee can move to its study of the four remaining standards: planning, resource allocation and institutional renewal, institutional assessment, general education and assessment of student learning.
“It lets us focus the self-study itself on four instead of 14, and we can make it a more interesting and more useful self-study process,” Blumenthal said.
The institutional planning study will focus on connecting planning mechanisms to resource allocations, which will involve information about the economy, leadership changes and the university’s second capital campaign fundraising program, which is set to launch this fall.
Both institutional assessment and assessment of student learning deal with collecting and analyzing data. While institutional assessment focuses on long-term university reports, assessment of student learning focuses on creating methods of improving the academic environment.
“This is where you get into interesting discussions with the faculty about, `How do we know that students have learned what they should be learning?'” Blumenthal said.
As part of this initiative, the steering committee asked that all academic programs develop and post their learning goals by the end of the spring semester. The committee is also considering the possibility of restructuring course syllabuses as a long-term project.
Blumenthal pointed to James Sandefur, chair of the math department, as an example of a professor who used creative methods to quantify student learning.
A few years ago, Sandefur hosted a series of “talk-alouds,” during which he filmed students working through math problems aloud. Sandefur moved away from the lecture-based style of teaching and reorganized the class into a dialogue- and presentation-based format.
“He learned that students were not approaching problems the way he expected them to do, so he totally transformed the approach of the class,” Blumenthal said.
She also cited a potential pilot program of keeping electronic student portfolios as another means of student assessment.
The accreditation process began in November 2009 after a MSCHE conference in Philadelphia, when a group of 21 Georgetown administrators and faculty from across the four undergraduate colleges, the Law Center and the Medical School formed the steering committee. The steering committee will publicize its findings this summer with the launch of an accreditation Web site. In the fall, the committee plans to hold town hall-style meetings to invite community input, she said. This group will then present its findings to the MSCHE, which will review its recommendations and finally determine Georgetown’s re-accreditation status, likely at MSCHE’s June 2012 commission meeting.
Should any university lose accreditation, the university would lose its federal financial aid for students, and likely, state aid as well. According to MSCHE Director for Communications and Public Relations Richard Pokrass, it would be would be detrimental to the institution’s reputation.
In August 2009, the MSCHE revoked accreditation for Southeastern University in Washington, D.C., after finding that the small private college lacked academic rigor and had financial stability. The university – which had been operating for 130 years – soon closed.
“The loss of accreditation is pretty much the death now to an institution,” Pokrass said.
He said it is rare for a university’s accreditation to be revoked; it has occurred twice in the past 25 years at MSCHE schools.
Pokrass said the MSCHE is more interested in bringing member universities into compliance with its 14 standards rather than revoking accreditation.
“We will walk the school through the process and really help them along,” he said.
Despite the recent accreditation removal of a D.C.-area school, Blumenthal is confident that the MSCHE will again grant Georgetown’s accreditation.
“I think there’s no chance that we will not be accredited,” she said, noting that that the MSCHE would likely send a follow-up committee if it found problems with the university.
Georgetown’s accreditation was last affirmed in November 2007 as part of a mid-cycle review, when the MSCHE requested a progress update that highlighted actions to strengthen university finances. “

For Newt Gingrich, conversion happened naturally.
“I feel like what happened was I became Catholic over time and then realized. It wasn’t like one morning I woke up and said, `You know, I think I’ll be Catholic,’ but rather the process surrounded me, absorbed me,” Gingrich said in an exclusive interview with The Hoya on his official switch to Catholicism last March.
Rep. Gingrich (R-Ga.), former speaker of the House of Representatives, joined by his wife Callista, spoke over the phone about the development of their new documentary on Pope John Paul II. Titled “Nine Days That Changed the World,” the film will be screened during the Gingrichs’ visit to campus on Monday.
Gingrich, a long-time Baptist before his highly publicized conversion last year, said producing “Nine Days” was the intellectual precursor that brought his spiritual journey full circle.
The documentary examines John Paul’s landmark 1979 visit to his home country of Poland while citizens were subject to communist rule.
The Gingrichs’ maintain that some aspects of communism – namely a vice-grip on freedoms of religious expression – still resonate today, especially in Western democracies.
“I think many Americans can identify with having a state which is anti-religious and which is seeking to create an entirely secular square,” Gingrich said, drawing a comparison between a 21st-century United States and a Soviet-era Poland, when prohibition of school prayer was the norm.
Callista agreed. “We’re seeing a growing secularism in this country, and we see it when we see opposition to school prayer and when crosses are taken down or covered. Even in Western democracies, the basic right of religious liberty is often threatened,” she said.
Last April, Georgetown was subject to similar threads of criticism. When the Obama White House requested the covering of the “IHS” symbol that adorned the backdrop of the Gaston Hall stage where the president was set to speak, the move spurred a torrent of backlash from students, faculty and alumni. Gingrich voiced his objection to the administrative call.
“When you go back to the founding of Georgetown and you look at the way in which for years, people scrimped and saved to find the pennies to launch Georgetown as a center of faith,” Gingrich said, invoking the university’s roots. “It was truly trite of their memory to allow an anti-religious White House to cover up the symbol of the cross.”
Gingrich said he believes the pope’s subtle undermining of communism in the 1970s shown in the documentary should set the example for the next steps in eliminating what he perceives as rampant secularism.
“Just as the Pope proved in nine days that changed the world in 1979, you don’t know in fact, when there’ll be a sudden catalytic moment and people will rediscover the depth of their belief in God and decide they don’t want the state to drive God out of their lives,” Gingrich said.
Callista said John Paul’s visit packed a punch, “creating a revolution of conscience that transformed Poland and reshaped the spiritual and political landscape in the 20th century.”
For the couple, last Saturday’s plane crash was personal. The fatal accident that wiped out a large swath of Poland’s political leadership cut short the lives of two figures the couple interviewed in their documentary: the chief of staff of President Lech Kaczynski, who was also killed, and Anna Walentynowicz, one of the founding leaders of Solidarity, the group that resisted communist rule in Poland partly due to John Paul’s role as an inspiration for the movement.
“Nine Days That Changed the World” premiered on April 9 at a theater in Mount Vernon, Va., and the Gingrichs stopped at the Catholic University of America on Tuesday to screen the film. Before coming to Georgetown, the couple will travel to Naples, Fla. for a Sunday showing at Ave Maria School of Law. International locations for future screenings include Warsaw and Krakow, Poland, as well as Rome. Gingrich said in the interview that there are plans to show the film at Harvard, an institution he said was “hardly a bastion of deep religious activity.”

A group of faculty and staff met yesterday to address the future of student research in the university’s curriculum.
Nick Healey, an education expert from the University of Gloucestershire, led the discussion, which resulted in suggestions ranging from increasing salaries for faculty who mentor undergraduate researchers to creating more campus journals and conferences to showcase student projects.
Healey focused on strategies for integrating research in regular classes. In Georgetown’s case, he praised the School of Nursing and Health Studies for its initiatives to involve students in research.
“They may not have called it research, but they’re engaging students as producers rather than consumers of knowledge,” Healey said.
The workshop is evidence of a wave of interest among Georgetown’s academic leadership in promoting student research.
“Everyone in the administration … thinks that elite universities have strong undergraduate research components. I think the question is, how do we fund its expansion, and how could it be better connected to the curriculum?” said Randy Bass, director of the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship.
Although the working group is only beginning its discussion, any reforms would likely include an expansion of the Georgetown Undergraduate Research Opportunities Project to create a broader Center for Student Research. The program, which currently assists about 150 students each year to take on research projects with faculty mentors, may also seek its own endowment in the future.
ore broadly, according to Sonia Jacobson, assistant for academic affairs in the Office of the Provost, the university must decide research should be emphasized for all undergraduates at Georgetown. If it is decided that research methods should be incorporated more closely into the standard curriculum, a possible outcome might be the requirement that each student take a certain number of research-intensive classes.
In any case, Bass hopes the university will move quickly.
“By next year, I hope we have a very clearly articulated vision for what the expansion of research here could look like … and we’re putting on something like a campus-wide undergraduate research conference that’s broadly attended by the community,” Bass said.
Sweeping changes may not occur any time soon, but Bass said that the research should be a high priority.
“We … believe that a school like Georgetown that thinks of itself as being in a certain elite company needs to have more resources spent on undergraduate research … and that this work is really trying to catch up to our peers,” Bass said.
This inquiry into undergraduate research comes as the university begins a process of self-study to prepare for its reaccreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in the spring of 2012. Other working groups will consider issues such as measuring student learning, allocating university funds, and collecting data on university activity. Jacobson promises that the administration will seek student opinions throughout the process. “

A longtime faculty member of the French department and the greater Georgetown community, Dorothy Betz passed away on Tuesday morning from a ruptured aorta.
According to Andrew Sobanet, chair of the French department, Betz did not feel well Monday evening and was rushed to the hospital. She died in surgery at about 6:30 a.m. Tuesday.
“[Betz] was a delight to work with. She was supportive, collegial, dedicated to her students and a great champion of the French language and French literature,” Sobanet said. “She also had a terrific sense of humor and was integral to the life of the French department. She will be sorely missed.”
First joining the university’s faculty 38 years ago, Betz became an influential member of the community.
“We are all shocked and saddened by this sudden, unfathomable loss. But what seems even more unimaginable is our department, indeed, Georgetown without [Betz],” said Miléna Santoro, associate professor in the French department.
Betz was an expert in 19th century French poetry, and she regularly published on the topic. Aside from her tenure in the French department, Betz very active in university affairs, serving as secretary to the faculty senate from 1983 to 1991, and was once more re-elected in 1995.
“[Betz] was one of the most dedicate faculty senate members I’ve ever known. She rarely, if ever, missed a meeting, and nearly always had a pithy and pointed comment,” President of the Faculty Senate Wayne Davis said. “It is hard to imagine the Senate without her.”
She also sat on the executive committee of Phi Beta Kappa, holding the position of vice president at the time of her death.
“Dorothy Betz was truly one of the most devoted citizens of the university,” Deborah Lesko Baker, professor and former chair of the French department, said.
According to Lesko Baker, Betz had been instrumental in the continuation of the Phi Beta Kappa chapter at Georgetown. At the time of her death, she had been planning this year’s reception for new inductees and their parents for graduation.
Betz had also pushed for the addition of a French floor in a student residence hall or a French house for students to be immersed in French and improve their language skills, Santoro said.
Santoro reflected on Betz’s generosity toward her colleagues.
“When I myself arrived at Georgetown in 1996, [Betz] went out of her way to make me feel welcome, inviting me to lunch and filling me in on life in the department on many occasions,” Santoro said.
Betz would also stitch items such as hand-crocheted shawls and curtains for her colleagues, Santoro said.
Pierre Taminiaux, associate professor in the French department, agreed with Santoro on Betz’s welcoming presence in the department. According to Taminiaux, Betz would hold a Christmas party in her office each year.
“It was a wonderful occasion to chat, eat and drink with colleagues from other departments who were also invited. She created a warmth and friendly atmosphere that enabled us to interact with one another in a casual way,” Taminiaux said.
“She loved everything social about the department. She was a real social animal,” Lesko Baker said. “She had wonderful stories. She loved to tell stories.”
Betz was also known for her sense of humor – the door of her office was covered with comic strips and humorous quotations.
“With me, she made a point of sharing comics that lampooned Québécois French and Canada more generally, since that is where I hail from. It was the kind of ribbing we both enjoyed,” Santoro said.
This semester, Betz taught Intermediate French 2 as well as Reading Texts in the French-Speaking World: Literatures. Other members of the French department will be taking over her classes for the remainder of the semester.
Some past students said that she was extremely knowledgeable and her passion for French language and literature came through her teaching. Betz had an extraordinary dedication to her students. Her students and their work were always at the top of her list, Lesko Baker said.
“She had that sort of quirky personality that kept things interesting and fun. She was also extremely brilliant. I took her French literature course, and her passion for the subject and the materials covered was highly evident,” Ridge Blanchard (COL ’11) said.
Kate Reilly (COL ’12), currently enrolled in Betz’s French literature class, reflected on how the class was much more than just a survey course as Betz would bring in artistic, social and political context from her own personal experiences.
“She was incredibly intelligent and cultured, and could recite French and English poetry and verses by memory. She was also able to connect her education to her daily life, calling them her digressions,” Reilly said. “She would share these connections with us, for our own cultural and intellectual benefit.”
Reilly said that Betz was unlike many of her other professors.
“She was a professor from a different generation of French. She taught my parents French,” she said.
Betz is survived by her husband Paul Betz, professor emeritus in the English department, who was unavailable for comment.
A Memorial Mass will be held on April 20 in Dahlgren Chapel of the Sacred Heart.

Potential measures addressing issues of diversity at Georgetown took center stage at open forum events this week, with a second town hall for the Diversity Initiative’s academic working group on Wednesdsay and a Thursday panel discussion with faculty and administrators.
The academic working group town hall convened for feedback about the proposed African-American studies major and potential curriculum diversity requirement for students.
To start the meeting, professor Eusebio Mujal-León of the government department said, “[It’s] very important we get a conversation generated about these things. We think Georgetown has not and does not do enough to expose its students to the pluralism that American society has and will have, that the world has and will have.” 
Mujal-Leon also said that the different opinions of the members of the working group led to a better understanding and discussion of diversity and the recommendations as a whole.
Students present at the town hall questioned the group’s interpretation of diversity. According to some, the working group failed to agree on a concrete definition for the term, leaving a hole in its recommendation to implement a diversity requirement in the academic curriculum.
According to professor Aviel Roshwald, chair of the history department and member of the academic working group, the diversity requirement would draw on current courses. Of the two courses that fulfill the diversity requirement, one class would cover diversity in the United States while the other would have a global diversity focus.
Marilyn McMorrow, visiting assistant professor in the School of Foreign Service, said at the meeting that she “was happy to see it was grounded in courses they [the students] are taking already.”
Several students asked, however, if keeping the same classes just maintained the status quo and did not truly promote any conversations of diversity.
“We don’t want it to become an avoidance mechanism for the institution,” Mujal-León said.
Some, including Ryan Wilson (COL ’12), chair of the Student Commission for Unity, were concerned with the timeline in which these changes would take place. The academic working group met this question with uncertainty, agitating several of the students present.
“As the founding director of the African-American Studies program, I understand this [academic] process. I am suggesting the committee implement a timeline in their recommendation,” professor Angelyn Mitchell said at the meeting. 
Another recurring topic of debate was hiring new faculty and the creation of ethnic studies majors.
But according to Mujal-León, the university will vote with its dollars, making faculty hiring the most crucial endeavor. Faculty hiring is under the authority of academic deans that run the search committees for such faculty.
“Of course I support the initiative, and every department chair will tell you that they favor increased funding for new professors or courses,” Jordan Sand, chair of east Asian languages and cultures department, said in an e-mail. “Personally speaking, I would like to see greater engagement between east Asian languages and cultures and curricular and research initiatives in other units in the university.”
The addition of an African studies major could potentially draw more prospective students and further institutionalize the program.
“One of the things that deterred me originally from Georgetown was how new the African studies program was,” John Matthew Hopkins (COL ’13) said. “In comparison [to peer institutions] there is a level of accountability . It would be irresponsible for the university to not consider the competition after graduation.”
Overall, many recognized that more feedback and the academic working group’s consideration of the feedback will be necessary to move forward.
“I was surprised there weren’t more faculty members here. I had hoped more faculty members would have been in this room,” Wilson said.
“I feel as if though the committee is very resistant to the opinions of the students . a lot of us are very invested. I feel like we are coming against so much opposition,” Ellie Gunderson (COL ’10) said.
Others present at the event included Veronica Salles-Reese, associate professor in the Spanish and Portuguese department, and Associate Academic Provost Marjory Blumenthal.
The discussion of increasing the diversity of Georgetown’s faculty continued Thursday night as various administers discussed diversity on campus.
Present were Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny, Interim Dean Carol Lancaster, associate professor Ricardo Ortiz and associate professor Maurice Jackson.
Each speaker identified his or her views on the presence of diversity at Georgetown.
Kilkenny spoke about the African American Studies program at Georgetown.
“It’s a shame that I can name [the African American professors]. It tells you that we are talking about small numbers of people,” Kilkenny said.
According to Kilkenny, it is important to continue to hire faculty from minority backgrounds. In order to do that, she said that it was necessary to create a climate where those hires can be successful and comfortable.
Lancaster discussed the relatively low number of female professors at Georgetown and attributed this phenomenon to an issue of comfort.
“I don’t think anyone [is] being mean to anyone else – and I see this in government,” Lancaster said. “But I suspect that people are more comfortable with people that look like them and seem like them and that kind of reverberates.”
Jackson told those present that he was concerned about the lack of a timeline for the institution of programs like African American Studies. He predicted current Georgetown students would have grandchildren before that became a reality.
He stated that his two goals for Georgetown were the immediate hiring of a more diverse faculty and increased efforts to recruit minority students of all ethnic and racial backgrounds.
Ortiz said that he had seen progress, but that it was slow.
“I’m basically the only person who Georgetown has ever hired to teach about what is now the biggest cultural minority in the country,” said Ortiz.
