Last Thursday, the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts voted against putting stone labels on the major memorials on the National Mall, reported the Associated Press. The National Park Service proposed the installation of the signs last spring in response to complaints from tourists who did not know what they were viewing, according to The Washington Post.
Some local residents and tourists from out of town agreed with the decision, citing a lack of need for the labels.
Ben Tyler, a resident of Virginia, said the CFA’s decision was a sound one.
“[The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts] should leave them the way they are and not put signs on them,” Tyler said.
Nathalie Gilly, a tourist from Belgium, said she was able to recognize the memorials without any labels since she had looked them up before she came to D.C. for a 10-day vacation, but she said putting signs on the memorials could be a good idea.
Robert Foy, an employee at the Smithsonian’s Freer Gallery of Art, said the signs were unnecessary because the name of the monument is not as important as the monument itself.
“You can know what it is without knowing the effect that it has on you. But just knowing the name of something doesn’t give the impression of what it is,” he said. “You have to feel the memorial itself and feel what it is before you can understand what it is called.”
The CFA was unavailable for comment.

The Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Foundation of Los Angeles granted the university $6.9 million to support the development of Catholic programs in the Office of Mission and Ministry, a need-based scholarship for students from Jesuit high schools and greater recruitment and retention of Jesuit faculty members.
“Not only will this gift strengthen our world-class academic offerings and advance our mission and ministry programs, it will also advance our efforts to ensure that Georgetown remains accessible and affordable to all students through scholarship support,” University President John J. DeGioia said in a university press release.
According to the university press release, $5 million of the gift will be allocated for supporting Catholic programs on campus to deepen understanding of and increase participation in the Catholic and Jesuit traditions.
“Georgetown’s Catholic and Jesuit traditions are what distinguish the institution and keep it vital. We are honored to play a part in strengthening these core values and to help students, faculty and staff put their faith into practice during their time at Georgetown and beyond,” said Kathleen McCarthy, daughter of the late Leaveys and chair of the foundation.
The gift will also create a new position to provide greater religious and educational opportunities for members of the Georgetown community.
“With this gift, I will be able to expand the programs of the Office of Mission and Ministry and better serve our faculty, staff, students and alums. I couldn’t be more grateful for this transformative gift,” Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Philip Boroughs, S.J. said.
$1 million of the gift will support a need-based scholarship for high school students matriculating into Georgetown from Jesuit schools, such as those eligible in the Cristo Rey Network of Catholic high schools in particular, according to the university press release.
The remaining $900,000 will be allocated to the Leavey Distinguished Jesuit Scholars Fund with the purpose of hiring Jesuit faculty members to continue to enhance the university’s academic programs.
The Leavey Foundation, named for the late Thomas Leavey (LAW ’23) and his late wife, has supported the university in the past, including the naming gift for the Leavey Center, support for a three-year visiting position as Leavey Chair in the Foundations of American Freedom within the department of government and the funding of a residence hall in the Southwest Quad, according to the university press release.
“[McCarthy] has been an extraordinary friend to Georgetown and with this gift continues a long legacy of Leavey family contributions to the university,” Boroughs said.

Despite a failed initial attempt to gain the university’s support, H*yas for Choice and United Feminists continue to pool efforts to sustain the goals of their newly established group, Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justice.
The group was formed this semester in an effort to improve access to material resources, access to information and free speech.
“All of these expectations are reasonable, necessary and urgent if we are to end the pattern of marginalization of the health and safety of the student body,” H*yas for Choice Vice President Erica Slates (SFS ’10) said.
The group wrote a letter to University President John J. DeGioia on Feb. 5 outlining their concerns, and on Feb. 24, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson responded in a letter.
“Through its Speech and Expression policy, the university provides students the opportunity to participate in a dialogue on a wide range of issues,” Olson wrote. “As a Catholic and Jesuit institution, however, Georgetown cannot support organizations whose stated purpose conflicts with Catholic moral teaching.”
Olson said in his letter that all D.C. residents have access to the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner service at the Washington Hospital Center. The Washington Hospital Center, located in North D.C. is the only site in the District that is authorized to provide this service.
He added that students can receive human papillomavirus vaccines from the university hospital’s outpatient pharmacy, which is located across the street from the Student Health Center.
“Georgetown’s policies and practices rest on the strong underpinning of Catholic social and moral teaching and its affirmation of the dignity of all persons from the beginning of life to its natural end,” Olson wrote. “I recognize that these are complex questions and that there are divergent points of view on the issues that you raise; that is why our policies and practices encourage debate and conversation.”
“Nonetheless,” Olson concluded, “as a Catholic and Jesuit university our policies must reflect our identity and our values.”
embers of Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justice believe these policies are unacceptable.
“Georgetown needs to answer to its students, and Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justice is hopeful that President DeGioia and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson will listen to the voices of its concerned students and take the necessary steps to end its hypocrisy,” Marion Cory (COL ’10) of United Feminists said.
The group has drafted a petition to ask the administration to continue to take their concerns into consideration. The petition currently has more than 100 signatures online.
“We have already received overwhelmingly positive and supportive feedback from many students and believe that the majority of students ultimately agree that the university’s current services are inadequate and will at the very least understand why it is important to bring up these issues at this time,” Slates said. “Ultimately, these are reasonable expectations that will bring Georgetown in line with the majority of schools of our caliber in the nation.”
According to Denise Yu, a sophomore at Columbia University who attended Boston College, a Jesuit university, last year, condoms are not available for sale on campus at BC. Additionally, students cannot use their flex dollars at an off-campus convenience store to purchase condoms either.
Students at the University of Notre Dame, a Catholic university, are also unable to obtain condoms on campus, according to Nick Goode, a junior at the institution.
Yet some other schools without religious affiliation are more willing to address the issues Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justice finds so important. According to Elizabeth May, a sophomore at Wake Forest University, the student health center at Wake Forest provides students with free condoms.
According to the group’s Web site, “Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justice is a coalition of students dedicated to changing the way that Georgetown University approaches issues of reproductive justice and choice.”
The group cites flaws in the university’s policy on reproductive issues such as the administration’s refusal to sell contraception on campus, the unavailability of rape kits in the campus hospital, the lack of sex education and the administration’s unwillingness to offer financial support to pro-choice student groups, such as H*yas for Choice.
“United Feminists and [H*yas for Choice] are operating as a unified coalition in solidarity with each other,” said Cory. “Although we are coming from two distinct groups, we are one coalition of students committed to engaging in this cause together.”
According to Slates, Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justice is currently working to plan events for this semester.”

Few Georgetown students are not familiar with the inconvenience of purchasing bottled water, whether they lug cases from CVS or spend the money to buy bottles individually from a Corp location on campus.
Four Georgetown students decided to do something about this problem. New this semester, H2Bro Delivery is a student-run service that delivers beverage orders to residences on campus and in the surrounding area on Sunday afternoons. The service offers a wide variety of drinks available for one-time delivery or for a recurring subscription.
“The basic premise of our operation is to hydrate the entire Georgetown campus,” said Andrew Pence (SFS ’12), one of the founders of H2Bro.
Pence and the other founders of H2Bro, Brian Kim (COL ’12), Peter Hadjipateras (COL ’12) and Bowen Williams (SFS ’12), first thought of the idea during their freshman year, and have spent the past two semesters working out the logistics of their brainchild.
“It took a long time to get things started, but we’re really glad that we actually pulled through with it,” Kim said.
Since their company launched in 2009, the group says their average volume of customers has been around 10 per week. The number fluctuates because some students place a one-time order of 10 cases, while others have weekly orders.
An appealing aspect of this operation is that students can place their orders online conveniently without leaving their rooms. Their Web site has a variety of beverage options.
Payment options include by credit card, secured by the online payment system PayPal, cash or check. The company’s goal is to make it as easy as possible for students to place their orders and receive their beverages.
“We hope to save the time and hassle it takes for students to bring back beverages in bulk from local places such as Wisey’s, [Vital Vittles] and [Hoya Snaxa],” Pence said.
In the future, the students say they are looking to expand their service to include snacks. H2Bro is soliciting suggestions on its Web site for other beverages and items that students would like to see made available.

Students gathered in Healy Hall’s Philodemic Room Wednesday for a student-led discussion of the DREAM Act, immigration-related legislation that, if passed into law, will have a significant impact on the lives of undocumented students in the United States, including members of the Georgetown community.
In an event sponsored by the Georgetown University College Democrats, Rev. Charles Currie, S.J., the president of the Jesuit Association of Colleges and Universities, addressed the audience and was joined by Juan Gomez (MSB ’11), an undocumented student whose parents are from Colombia, and Matias Ramos, an immigrant from Argentina and board member of the United We Dream network.
The three speakers advocated for the safe passage of the DREAM Act. The bill would grant undocumented students that arrived in the United States at or before the age of 15 the opportunity to gain conditional residence to attend college or serve in the military for two years, and then gain permanent residence.
“The idea of immigration reform is being discussed in campuses throughout the United States, and appears to be the defining question of this generation,” Ramos said.
Currie spoke of the symbolism behind the name of the legislation.
“As the name recognizes, higher education is essential for achieving the American Dream that immigrants to this nation have sought since the foundation of this nation,” Currie said.
Gomez spoke of the embarrassment he felt as all of his friends applied and were accepted to elite colleges in the United States.
“I realized that the situation had caught up to me,” Gomez said. “I didn’t even have a [driver’s] license, and felt like I had to lie to my friends, so they wouldn’t know I was undocumented.”
Currie provided the perspective of a documented citizen.
“You can read all about detention centers, what happens, but it passes over your conscience,” Currie said. “When you meet people, it becomes so much more real.”
The speakers then acknowledged the difficulty of passing the bill in Congress. Due to the fact that the DREAM Act is most likely to be packaged with comprehensive immigration reform, the legislation is likely to fail due to the current political atmosphere in Washington, they said.
Both Gomez and Ramos informed the audience that they had been given orders of deportation from the government.
“They haven’t carried them out yet, and luckily, our friends in the Senate have passed six-month reprieves, but should anything happen to that, I would have to leave, which is a scary thought,” Gomez said.
Ramos plans to lobby Congress to pass the DREAM Act with the United We Dream network. The United We Dream network sponsored the DREAM Action Week from Feb. 22 to Feb. 27 to raise awareness among Americans.
“This is stage one. There are marches going on in Los Angeles, Chicago and Wisconsin,” Ramos said. “The second stage is a march in D.C., starting on March 10.”
Ramos also spoke of a plan to declare March 10 “Coming Out of the Shadows Day.”
“[People can] show who they really are, to encourage people to reveal their status to the people they know,” Ramos said.
Currie concluded the discussion by warning against a quick fix for the problem.
“Be in this for the long haul. These issues are complex – you have to be willing to stay at it,” Currie said.
GUCD organized the forum as part of its Immigration Week.

Sponsored North Face climber, skier, adventure photographer and one of People’s most eligible bachelors in 2003, Jimmy Chin discussed his unconventional career path, the thrill of his job and the need for an open-minded attitude toward life, in White-Gravenor Hall Thursday evening.
Chin, who has been featured in magazines such as National Geographic, Adventure, Outside, Men’s Health and ESPN Magazine, engaged the crowd of about 65 attendees, who listened attentively to anecdotes from his climbing adventures. Known for crossing Tibet’s Chang Tang Plateau on foot and skiing down the North Face of Mount Everest, Chin traverses the globe for more than eight months of the year – climbing, skiing and taking photos.
The event, co-sponsored by the Lecture Fund and Georgetown Program Board, featured over 50 photos of his adventures, including climbing Mount Everest in 2006 and 2007, the previously unclimbed towers in the Kakakoram and the peaks in the Himalayas.
Without any predetermined postgraduate plans as he neared the end of college, Chin said he opted to spend a year pursuing his passions for climbing and skiing. His year of exploration soon evolved into a career of adventure photography.
“Because that’s where my heart was and that’s where my passion was,” Chin said.
Travis Smith (MSB ’13) was particularly struck by Chin’s personal motto to follow one’s passion.
“I loved that he kept that college philosophy of being open to new things throughout his life, [since] I feel many people lose that philosophy [after they graduate].”
“I think his perspective is something every college kid needs to hear,” Bettina Bergöö (COL ’11) said.
Chin fell into a photography career after living off of a variety of jobs for a year while climbing in Yosemite, the “mecca of rock-climbers,” he said.
“It became my role to work with these world-class athletes so people could see [their talent] . The athletic prowess and mental capacity to do that is unthinkable, so bringing back stories like that is what I got involved with,” Chin said.
Chin was paid $500 for his first photo (he has never taken a photography class), which he then used to buy his first professional camera. He kicked off his adventure photography career on his next trip to Pakistan.
Chin often takes his photographs while he is in the middle of the action. The views he captures in photo form are often visible only from high-risk altitudes and in “no-fall zones.”
“The biggest challenge for me is shooting in really uncontrolled environments and many difficult situations . my job is to shoot under physical, mental, and environmental stress,” Chin said.
Chin also discussed his respect for the climbers and skiers with whom he works regularly. “I realized a lot of the people I was shooting were world-class athletes, and if they were in a well-known sport, they would be making millions of dollars, as we love seeing the human potential and what people can do under the pressure,” Chin said.
Addressing the extreme physical stress on the body during his adventures, Chin said one can be gone for over two months on one particular climb, working in the earliest hours of the morning, intensely rationing food and bearing with severe, freezing temperatures.
He explained that all the team’s supplies are weighed to the ounce in order to accommodate weight and space considerations, adding that he and his team are constantly seeking to lessen the weight of their packs.
Despite such challenges, Chin said he loves his lifestyle.
“Climbing is one of those things where you enjoy it afterwards . it gives you a sense of insignificance, a good perspective,” Chin said.
When asked about his next steps, Chin said he would be headed to Turkey, Chad and Antarctica.
“You never know where things will lead you,” Chin added.
Onni Irish (SFS ’12) first heard Chin speak at a National Geographic workshop for college students. Afterward, starting in October, she began working with the Lecture Fund and GPB to bring Chin to Georgetown.
“We have so many speakers from politics and international relations, and this is international relations in a totally different form . it’s the wild world,” Irish said.

American University recently launched a pilot program to integrate SmarTrip fare card technologies into university identification cards, according to AU Student Government President Andy MacCracken.
MacCracken distributed 20 cards to students, staff and faculty for a testing period that began in mid-February. The SmarTrip cards – nearly the same dimensions of a GOCard – allow patrons to enter the Metro rail system and pay Metro bus fare by tapping the card on a reader. The SmarTrip fare on Metro buses, at $1.25, is 10 cents less than the cash fare.
The cards combine the SmarTrip wireless functionality with the typical magnetic strip swipe function, which allows students to access residence halls, meal plans and debit dollars, MacCracken said. Metro provided blank card stock to the university, which printed student ID information onto the card surface, he said.
Georgetown attempted a similar program last academic year, but the card stock that Metro provided to the university was not durable enough to handle extensive use, Roman Fahrmann, director of GOCard Services, said.
“There were too many card failures,” Fahrmann said. “The cards produced by Metro had about a 50 percent failure rate.”
The failure of Georgetown’s program came after a three-year period that saw multiple obstacles to the program. The university could not agree with WMATA officials on a price for the card, and the program was again halted when the firm that manufactures the SmarTrip cards had previously trademarked the name “GOCard” for one of its brands of fare cards.
Nick Troiano (COL ’11), GUSA senator and liaison to the District of Columbia Metro University Student Alliance, said a successful test at American could mean the first step in achieving discount fares for university students. If a fare card already demonstrates that the rider is a student, it would be more feasible for Metro to program a discount into these cards, he said.
According to Troiano, and other representatives on DCMUSA, the alliance launched an effort two years ago to negotiate a reduced fare for student Metro riders.
“We met with some of the board members of Metro, and the Metro Advisory Council,” Troiano said. “It’s something that takes a lot of coordination on the university’s end. There have to be some resources put forth by all universities to make this work. If given a discount more students will ride, and it will be close to revenue neutral.”
American’s testing phase will continue through March 5, when MacCracken will seek a qualitative assessment from the cards’ test users. The assessment will center on how the cards stand up to the demands of typical usage, before expanding to a broader test program in March, he said.
Metro officials did not return calls for comment on the fare discount negotiations or the initiative to integrate GOCards with SmarTrip technology.
