The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate unanimously passed a resolution Oct. 3 urging the university to strengthen food safety and sanitation protocols at on-campus dining locations.
The resolution specifically calls on Georgetown University to work with Aramark, Georgetown’s food service distributor, and other food providers on campus to bolster food safety and cleanliness training, establish a food delivery system for students and work to address food insecurity on Georgetown’s campus.
The university must do more to ensure the safety and cleanliness of food provided by campus dining options, according to the resolution.
“The University has not provided effective training to new hires at the dining hall, leading to lack of basic cleanliness, cross-contamination, and undercooked food,” the resolution reads. “This poses a significant risk to students who eat food from the Dining hall.”
The resolution comes after Georgetown Vice President and Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Ranit Mishori (MED ’02) announced Sept. 24 that more than 90 students had reported symptoms of norovirus, a highly contagious gastrointestinal virus that spreads through direct contact or contaminated food and water. Several students also reported experiencing food poisoning after eating food from campus dining locations in a GUSA survey sent out Sept. 22.
Precautions taken by the university against food contamination were not communicated to the student body, according to GUSA Senator Kathryn Yang (SFS ’23), one of the authors of the Oct. 3 resolution.
“I’ve definitely seen changes in the dining hall itself. You now can’t get drinks from the station directly and someone has to hand it to you, and it seems like there are measures to stop cross-contamination,” Yang said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “However, they haven’t communicated that through email or any other written form.”
The university did not adequately communicate with students about the norovirus outbreak and possible food contamination, according to GUSA Senator Dominic Gordon (SFS ’24), who co-sponsored the resolution.
“You can’t stop a virus from entering things,” Gordon said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “It gets on my nerves that we have to constantly deal with this crisis and it’s the student government that sends out information before the administration.”
The norovirus outbreak has not been linked to any campus dining locations, according to a university spokesperson.
“While it is reassuring to know the likely pathogen responsible for this outbreak, we still do not know the source. At this time, we have found no link to a food source or any of the dining venues on campus,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Following a visit from DC Health, we have determined that campus dining locations, including Leo O’Donovan Hall, can safely remain open.”
The university took immediate action to avoid contamination, including deep cleaning dining spaces, residence halls, academic buildings and other facilities, according to the university spokesperson.
Since the norovirus outbreak has prompted students to start avoiding food from the dining hall, instances of food insecurity have increased on campus, according to Yang.
“When they released the announcement that norovirus was going on, we were already subjected to this inflexible meal plan, as well as the fact that Leo’s is one of the only places that provides meal swipe options,” Yang said. “A lot of underclassmen students, as well as myself, rely on that to get food every day.”
In addition to the calls for increased food safety, the resolution calls on the university to provide delivery services to students who are ill or self-quarantining and to address food insecurity on campus beyond mandating meal plans for all on-campus students.
The GUSA Senate previously urged the university to provide cheaper meal plans for on-campus students and meal plan exemptions for upperclassmen in a resolution passed Aug. 29, following long lines, overcrowding and few meal choices at Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall. 
Students must continue to advocate for the university to enforce more food safety measures, according to Yang.
“We’re in this situation, and the only thing we can do is keep pressuring the administration and keep contacting and communicating with them,” Yang said.

Seriously, this is going to stop many new students from even considering applying to GU. It’s appalling enough that there’s zero interest in Georgetown by seniors this year on arguably the largest college application forum in America – Applying to Colleges on Reddit – which is a good indicator of where the school the headed; it’s embarrassing enough that the University is not on the Common App to drum up any interest in it (I have to explain to anyone who asks that it actually exists!), and it’s ridiculous that while every school is offering a smorgasbord of STEM subjects, GU has not given an iota of thought to strengthening that part of its curriculum to attract the best and brightest future donors – but this year it’s been downright shameful that seniors at my old school aren’t even considering GU, and it’s NOT just because of the norovirus outbreak. 
How much sheer embarrassment is the school going to tolerate – after the Instagram georgetownhotmess debacle, the norovirus outbreak, and now the sexual harrassment claims – who will even want to go here anymore? I’m seriously thinking of leaving, and I’m not the only one. At least half a dozen kids I know have already decided to call its quits. This is not going to bode well for GU. 
The university need to get its act – and its rodent-infested facilities – together. The norovirus outbreak was not altogether unexpected, and in a pandemic, it’s not going to be the last.

The Corp is now requiring all employees to complete weekly COVID-19 tests and symptom surveys. 
Before clocking into their shifts and attending large Corp events, employees must submit a symptom screening and personal protective equipment (PPE) survey that The Corp administers through its employee time management system. The Corp’s upper management team announced the policy change Sept. 27, after welcoming approximately 110 new employees, according to Matt Davis (SFS ’22), CEO and president of The Corp. Management finalized the decision after debating whether the company should go beyond Georgetown University’s health and safety guidelines, according to Davis. 
As the largest student-run business on campus, The Corp has a responsibility to enforce higher safety standards for its employees than the university’s general guidelines for on-campus community members, according to Davis.
“We have two halves: as a student but also as a service worker,” Davis said in an interview with The Hoya. “You have an added responsibility as a service industry to make sure you are safe but also that the customer, the community you’re serving, is safe. So that’s what led us to have more stringent health and safety guidelines as opposed to Georgetown.”
Georgetown’s current COVID-19 health policy requires fully vaccinated students, faculty and staff to complete a COVID-19 test if randomly selected to or if they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for the virus. Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people are required to get tested twice per week. 
Leadership of The Corp began implementing these stricter health and safety guidelines during the last weeks of September as they welcomed their new hiring class, according to Davis. 
The Corp was also prompted to enforce new guidelines because of a rise in COVID-19 cases within the organization and in the Georgetown community, according to Davis.
The week of Sept. 26, 37 people at the main campus, Georgetown University Medical Center and Georgetown University Law Center tested positive for COVID-19. The positivity rate increased .39% from the week of Sept. 19. 
The Corp’s new policy is a necessary response to the rise in COVID-19 cases at Georgetown, according to Mallory Kirk (COL ’23), an employee at The Hilltoss, a Corp location in the Healey Family Student Center.
“I think it’s a really smart policy that Georgetown should implement,” Kirk wrote in a message to The Hoya. “It gives me peace of mind and I think it’s necessary considering the recently increasing cases.”
Implementing these new protocols will hopefully prompt a drop in COVID-19 cases among Corp employees, providing a safer experience for both employees and customers and allowing the group to hold large meetings and social gatherings, according to Davis. 
Christina Oelhafen (COL ’25), a new hire for Hoya Snaxa, welcomes the weekly testing initiative.
“The weekly COVID tests are definitely necessary considering we interact with so many people inside and outside of our service,” Oelhafen wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The process of adjusting Corp health guidelines began in January 2021, when the group first reopened two locations on campus, The Corp Cafe at Grounded and Vital Vittles, after closing all locations in March 2020. Upon the reopening, The Corp implemented new safety measures, requiring employees to take a health survey before shifts and sanitize locations throughout the day.
The new COVID-19 protocols will likely be a long-term change to The Corp’s procedures, according to Davis, who said the organization wants to maintain the new testing policy to ensure healthy interactions between employees and customers.
“Speaking for The Corp specifically, we are prepared to keep these added safety measures for as long as necessary,” Davis said. “Definitely through the semester, probably through the end of the year, and potentially even into next year. We recognize that we aren’t perfect, and we’re trying to do the best we can, and that takes time to learn and grow.”

The Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service (GERMS) will now operate during all hours of the weekend after previously cutting operating hours to only weekend nights.
The student-run, volunteer emergency medical services (EMS) organization announced Sept. 24 that it will expand its operating hours to run from Thursdays at 8 p.m. to Mondays at 8 a.m. starting Sept. 30. GERMS had previously been operating only from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays because of staffing shortages in leadership positions.
During the month of September, GERMS leadership trained several members to promote them to crew leader and driver positions, roles that are vital to the operation of the group’s ambulances. The organization now has five members who are qualified to serve as crew leaders and five members who are qualified to serve as drivers, according to Ashley Rensted (COL ’22), GERMS vice president of staff.
This training was crucial to upholding the quality of service the group provides, according to Rensted
“We worked throughout September to promote several members,” Rensted wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This has been something we have been working to do for a very long time, but the process of promoting current members to crew leaders and driver positions takes a significant amount of time as we are not willing to compromise the quality of care that we provide.”
GERMS responds to students suffering from various illnesses, injuries and high intoxication on campus and in the off-campus neighborhoods of West Georgetown, Burleith and Foxhall. The organization also treats medical issues for any resident of these neighborhoods.
In addition to cutting operating hours, GERMS also announced Aug. 24 that it would not be taking any new members for the fall semester in order to focus on promoting current members to crew leader and driver positions, as well as training new members hired during the COVID-19 pandemic. GERMS did not operate between March 2020 and June 2021, meaning the organization had to train those members once they arrived on campus in September, according to Rensted.
Students should call GERMS if they have a medical emergency, according to a university spokesperson.
“This action moves GERMS one step closer to resuming its normal operating hours,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “GERMS is working to train and certify additional students and will be increasing staff in the coming months.”
GERMS plans to continuously expand operating hours during the semester as more members are promoted to leadership positions, aiming to reach its previous 24-hour coverage, according to Rensted. All 50 students who currently make up GERMS have to balance college and work schedules, which the organization must keep in mind when setting operating hours. Rensted said consultation with GERMS volunteers was essential in the decision to expand service hours.
Students who call GERMS outside of its operating hours will automatically be forwarded to the Georgetown University Police Department, who will immediately dispatch D.C. Fire and EMS (FEMS) services. 
Both GERMS and FEMS abide by the medical amnesty policy for students, ensuring that after receiving treatment, they will face no disciplinary consequences for underage drinking or drug use. Despite this policy, some students have raised concerns over the convenience of medical services. However, while GERMS ambulance transportation is free for students, FEMS charges between $428 and $735 for its services. In addition, while GERMS typically receives two or three calls per weekday and four to five calls on weekend nights, FEMS usually receives over 400 calls a day.
According to Finn Thompson (COL ’22), GERMS’ new operating hours will benefit student safety on campus.
“They are a crucial aspect of our campus, run by student volunteers who deserve all the credit in the world for training enough members after COVID to reach this kind of coverage,” Thompson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Without GERMS, students would have to pay exorbitant fees for EMS services and trips to the hospital.”
GERMS’ new expansion of operating hours will hopefully reduce the financial and logistical barriers for students in need of medical treatment, making it easier for students to get immediate, less costly medical help, according to Rensted.
“Our hope is that expanding our hours will make students more willing to call for medical help when they need it,” Rensted wrote.

The Georgetown University McDonough School of Business (MSB) announced that the MSB Class of 2025 featured increased gender and racial diversity compared to previous years in both graduate and undergraduate programs. 
The Executive MBA, Master of Science in Business Analytics and Master of Science in Management programs all had incoming classes this fall that saw increases in female and U.S. minority student enrollment. The undergraduate Class of 2025 is one of the most diverse classes in MSB history, according to a university announcement. 
According to the MBA class profiles, African American, Hispanic American, Native American and Asian American students are designated as U.S. minority students. 
The increased diversity of gender and racial identities will encourage the MSB to cultivate richer academic and social programming, according to Patricia Grant, senior associate dean for undergraduate programs at the MSB and co-chair of the standing committee on diversity, equity and inclusion.
“We are encouraged by our gains in gender and racial diversity in the undergraduate program,” Grant wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our current demographics in relation to age, geography, and faith traditions will also add to conversations and innovations in our program academically and socially.”
The incoming class for the undergraduate business program is 37% female-identifying, which increased from 36% from the Class of 2024, and 38% U.S. minority-identifying students, which increased from 37% from the Class of 2024. The incoming class for the full-time MBA program is 32% female-identifying and 40% U.S. minority-identifying; the MBA class profile did not provide comparisons to previous classes.
According to Elie Farhat, chief admissions officer for MSB graduate admissions, the gender and racial diversity of the incoming class is a significant milestone for the MSB.
“I am proud of our admissions teams for their strategic effort to be inclusive of women and underrepresented minority populations in their recruitment efforts,” Farhat wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have made great strides in these areas and will continue to reach underserved groups to bring a diversity of perspectives and experiences to our programs.”
Last summer, the MSB established a diversity, equity and inclusion initiative supported by the Baker Trust for Transformational Learning, a Georgetown investment organization that supports educational innovation, according to Grant.
The DEI initiative began to analyze the MSB undergraduate core curriculum with a group of faculty, student and staff fellows with the goal of adding evaluations of the curriculum to a compiled course resource department, according to Grant.
As part of the initiative, the MSB administration appointed George Comer as the school’s first director of underrepresented minority student support. The role was created after the DEI standing committee recommended the MSB form a position to better support underrepresented minority students navigating Georgetown. MBA faculty and staff also host a “Prospective Women’s Day,” another program intended to expand the MBA program’s efforts to recruit students from around the world, according to Farhat.
“Even though our focus has always been on recruiting for diversity in our programs, we are constantly revisiting and adapting our events to make them more visible with relevant content,” Farhat wrote.
For the full-time and Flex MBA programs, the school runs an annual event titled “Focus on Diversity,” which is a career development opportunity for women, underrepresented minority and LGBTQ students. Other cross-program efforts to support diversity at the school include the pre-orientation BUILD program, Smart Start, Pivot program and GU Reach Programs. The Georgetown MBA program also offers scholarships, events and resources to support underrepresented groups of students and their families, including women, underrepresented U.S. minorities, veterans and international students. 
The DEI committee, which will be publishing a website related to its efforts and initiatives later this fall, will continue to track milestones and communicate transparently with the MSB community about its progress, according to Grant. 
“We are constantly changing as the world changes around us,” Grant wrote. “Our focus on DEI is long standing as a school that prepares business leaders for a complex and global world.”

The Council of the District of Columbia officially began its redistricting process Sept. 29 after a five-month delay because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In the redistricting process, government officials will use population data from the 2020 census to redraw boundaries to balance population numbers in each of Washington, D.C.’s eight wards. Originally scheduled to begin in April 2021, the process was postponed after the United States Census Bureau delayed the release of the official 2020 census from March 31 to Sept. 16.
Now that the official census data has been released, the D.C. Council subcommittee on redistricting, made up of the at-large councilmembers who do not represent a specific ward, will have 90 days to finalize new maps. As part of the process, the committee will hold public hearings and analyze constituent suggestions for new maps submitted through an online redistricting tool before presenting a final planto the D.C. Council for a vote. 
Engaging the public in the redistricting process will help inform citizens about the political landscape in D.C., according to Amanda Farnan, communications director for the office of Councilmember Christina Henderson (I-At-Large).
“There is a tool online where residents can go and redraw the lines with what they think may be fair or just and then submit those maps to the Council,” Farnan said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “The Council, of course, is looking forward to reviewing those maps and will take those recommendations into account when deciding on the lines.” 
Currently, the councilmembers expect that the boundaries for Wards 6, 7 and 8 will have to be redrawn because their population sizes shifted drastically in the past 10 years, according to Samuel Rosen-Amy, chief of staff for the office of Councilmember Elissa Silverman (I-At-Large).
“Three wards are either too big or too small and they do have to change, their boundaries must change,” Rosen-Amy said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “That’s Ward 6, which is too big by almost 18,000 people, which is really big, and then Wards 7 and 8 are both too small, by about 5,000 for Ward 7 and about 3,000 for Ward 8.”
The purpose of balancing the population sizes of the various wards is to ensure that every vote in the District has the same weight, according to Rosen-Amy.
“This is an important part of democracy, we want to ensure the principle of one person, one vote,” Rosen-Amy said. “Redistricting is an important part of that because if one or certain wards get much bigger than others it really waters down their ability to elect a representative.” 
After the new ward lines are drawn and the D.C. Council votes on the new maps, Ward Task Forces will work to determine new boundaries for the Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC), which are the neighborhood bodies within the wards. The members of the Ward Task Forces will be appointed by the councilmember of each specific ward and will begin work to redraw ANC lines Jan. 2022, according to Farnan.
Still, the redistricting process in the District looks different compared to other places in the United States. The District is not a state, which means that the nearly 700,000 people who live in the District do not have a voting representative in the House or the Senate. The District still completes the census for U.S. population metrics. 
Multiple states, like Florida, Texas and Arizona, saw lower than anticipated population counts in the 2020 census, and the District did not surpass a population of 700,000 as anticipated.  
According to Farnan, this year’s census, and thus the redistricting process, may have been impacted by undercounting after there were questions over whether the census would contain questions about citizenship status.
“We do believe that there was an undercount,” Farnan said. “However, of course, the Office of Planning in D.C. will conduct their own analysis to make sure that when we redraw the lines it’s as accurate as possible.” 
Still, as the redistricting process begins, it is unlikely that any resident of the District will be severely impacted by the new ward lines, because more will stay the same than will change, according to Rosen-Amy.
“At the end of the day, you haven’t actually moved where you’re living, your neighbors are still your neighbors, your services should still be provided as usual, and it doesn’t affect school boundaries,” Rosen-Amy said. “If all goes well, no one should see a significant change in their day-to-day lives.”

Technological innovations are key elements of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) plan to combat emerging threats, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at an Oct. 5 event.
The event, titled “NATO in a Competitive World,” was hosted by the Walsh School of Foreign Service and the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy organization. Stoltenberg, who served two terms as prime minister of Norway, spoke about NATO’s emerging technological programs to combat burgeoning security threats. The conversation was moderated by Dr. Michael O’Hanlon, the Brookings Institution’s director of research in foreign policy and adjunct professor at Georgetown’s Center for Security Studies. 
NATO is at a critical point where it is facing new security threats, according to Stoltenberg. 
“We are at a pivotal moment for our shared security where we face a more dangerous and more competitive world. Russia is more aggressive abroad and more oppressive at home. China is using its economic and military might to control its own people, coerce other countries, and assert control over global supply chains, critical infrastructure and other assets,” Stoltenberg said in the event. “We also face more frequent and sophisticated cyber-attacks, persistent terrorist threats and the security impacts of climate change.” 
NATO was formed in 1949 as a military alliance between 12 North American and Western European countries to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. Since then, it has expanded to include 30 member states and aims to guarantee the freedom and security of its members through political and military means, according to its website. 
In order to adapt to 21st century challenges, NATO’s members are increasing military spending and developing technological solutions through civil-military partnerships, according to Stoltenberg.NATO created the Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA), a proposal for the NATO 2030 agenda that is a roadmap for the coming decade that will prepare the organization to combat predicted threats. DIANA provides a space for civilian and military organizations to work together in fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology and space to secure NATO’s technological advantage against security threats. 
In addition to the cyber program portion of DIANA, NATO has also developed offensive cyber technologies to combat cyber threats from non-state actors like the terrorist organization ISIS, also known as DAESH, according to Stoltenberg. 
“We have also developed what is referred to as ‘national cyber effects,’ which is actually offensive cyber. NATO allies have used them against ISIS, or DAESH, to take down their cyber networks as part of the fight against ISIS. So we exercise, we train, we share best practices. We need to maintain our edge in the cyber domain to remain the most successful and strongest alliance in history,” Stoltenberg said. 
NATO has also prioritized increasing cooperation with non-Atlantic allies to address future needs, according to Stoltenberg. 
“We are stepping up to defend the rules-based international order by deepening our cooperation with like-minded countries and organizations, including in the Asia-Pacific,” Stoltenberg said. ”For the first time in our history, we are putting climate change and security at the core of NATO’s agenda.” 
NATO’s allies in the Asia-Pacific region include Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand. The four Pacific countries joined a NATO Foreign Ministerial Meeting for the first time in December 2020. At the meeting, the countries discussed the rise of China, a persistent concern during Stoltenberg’s tenure leading the organization. 
Multilateral alliances like NATO enable their member countries to effectively confront obstacles, according to Stoltenberg. 
“None of us can face these challenges alone. No country, however big, and no continent, however rich. Neither the U.S. nor Europe alone. But in NATO we are not alone. Together we represent 30 different nations, 1 billion people, half of the world’s economic and military might, and together we are adapting to a more uncertain world,” Stoltenberg said. 
The future of global security is unpredictable, but a multilateral approach strengthens the ability to continue to respond to emergent threats, according to Stoltenberg. 
“We do not know what the next crisis will be. But we do know that whatever happens we are safer when we stand together,” Stoltenberg said.

At approximately 10:45 a.m. Sept. 30, Darnall Hall first-floor resident Joe Massaua (SFS ’25) was shocked to witness a flood in progress outside his dorm room. 
“I was doing homework in another room and then I come back and I hear this whooshing noise. I’m on the other side of the dorm, in the other hallway, and I see water rushing out of the bathroom,” Massaua said in an interview with The Hoya. 
On Sept. 30, water began to rush out of the first-floor men’s bathroom in Darnall while university maintenance staff worked to fix several broken toilets. The water then flowed out into the hall and into several of the surrounding rooms, causing flooding in residents’ personal spaces, according to a university spokesperson. 
While university staff attempted to fix a toilet that appeared to have been tampered with, clean water began pouring out of the toilet, which built up and spread into the hall and several student rooms, according to a university spokesperson. 
University maintenance staff have removed damaged furniture and items from the student rooms and will continue to deal with the damaged rugs, according to the spokesperson.
“Custodial staff removed the water and then removed rugs and other damaged items; they also mopped and sanitized student rooms,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email sent to The Hoya. “We continue to clean and replace the damaged rugs.”
According to Michael Oddo (SFS ’25), maintenance staff cleaned his room and removed his damaged items after the flooding occurred.
“The maintenance staff, when I was gone, ended up going into my room and poured soapy water on the floor and then vacuumed it all up,” Oddo said in an interview with The Hoya. “They also put all of the containers that were under my bed, dripping with toilet water, on the top of my bed. They also took all of our rugs and put them in one of the showers. Currently there are like eight wet rugs left in one of the showers that they haven’t dealt with.”
Oddo came back after the damaged items were removed from his room to find his personal belongings drenched in water, with no explanation or guidance from university officials.
“The toilet water seeped into a bunch of the containers and I had to throw away a bunch of food. I had to put everything away when I got back and replace my bedding since it was drenched with toilet water,” Oddo said. 
This incident is one of the many issues with facilities that Darnall residents have encountered since the beginning of the fall semester, according to Massaua.
“We’ve had other issues with our toilets as well. The girls’ toilet overflowed and it was all over the floor,” Massaua said. “I think we had maybe two toilets, when you would flush them, they would just squirt out water, so that’s what they were coming to fix.”
University facilities staff previously responded to a separate incident in the Darnall first-floor women’s bathroom Tuesday, Sept. 28, where two toilets were clogged and overflowed, according to the university spokesperson, who said the water did not flow beyond the women’s bathroom.
University staff are doing what they can to resolve the issue and prevent similar occurrences in the future, according to a university spokesperson. 
“University officials are investigating whether this incident was intentionally caused,” the university spokesperson wrote. “If so, any community members found to be involved will incur disciplinary action via the student conduct process.”
However, students still remain frustrated with the lack of communication between university officials and Darnall residents.
“I didn’t get any emails or any info about what to do if anything was destroyed,” Oddo said. “I was just left with the torn-up room when I got back. For the next day or so, maintenance people walked around and surveyed the floor, but since then, that is it.”
Oddo said he was grateful the situation did not result in any permanent or complete damage. 
“I’m glad nothing was completely destroyed, besides the rug, I guess, but it definitely was not the best thing to come back to after a ‘Problem of God’ midterm,” Oddo said.

We need to get the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs to come do building inspections on campus. Some of the buildings and their facilities need to be condemned, razed and rebuilt.
But does Georgetown have the money? It WOULD – if it only was able to attract more revenue to campus. It should learn from Princeton, Stanford, etc.. that use tourism to keep their campuses neat and clean. Or what about UChicago that does such a great marketing job, that it uses all its revenue from applications to increase program offerings to its undergrad population, and retain top instructors. 
GU really needs to attract funding. When will this happen? C’mon, why are no alumni donating to our school? Even Johns Hopkins managed to get Bloomberg on its team – why can’t we?!
