A burglary occurred in the early hours of Thursday on the 3800 block of S Street. A laptop, two televisions, credit cards and other items were stolen while one of the residents was asleep, according to a Public Safety Alert issued by the Department of Public Safety on Saturday.
The home was burglarized after 1 a.m. and the suspect entered through an unlocked rear door, according to the PSA. The residents were not affiliated with the university.
This is the third burglary to occur in Burleith this academic year. On Aug. 30, a suspect forcefully entered a house on the 3800 block of S Street and sexually assaulted a sleeping victim. On Sept. 16, a suspect broke into a house on the 3600 block of T Street through an unlocked window.
Both the Metropolitan Police Department and DPS have warned students to keep all doors and windows locked to prevent burglaries.
