As campaigns enter their final push before midterm elections Tuesday, two Georgetown alumni are clamoring to join the 20 alumni already serving in Congress, while other alumni run for other political seats.
Democrat Deborah Dingell (SFS ’75, GRD ’98) remains in control of her campaign to represent Michigan’s 12th Congressional District, while independent candidate Nick Troiano (COL ’11, GRD ’13) and Democrat Sandra Fluke (LAW ’12) continue their push to remain competitive in their respective elections for Pennsylvania’s 10th Congressional District and California State Senate.
Dingell, who is currently a consultant for the American Automobile Policy Council, is running to fill the seat of her retiring husband, John Dingell (COL ’49, LAW ’52), the longest-serving member of Congress in its history. Decisively winning the August Democratic primary election by 40 points in a predominantly blue district, which spans from Detroit’s western suburbs to Ann Arbor, Dingell is heavily favored in the upcoming midterm against Republican challenger Terry Bowman. According to Roll Call, almost one in six of all women who have ever served in Congress succeeded their deceased partners. If elected, however, she would be the only woman to serve in Congress ever to succeed a husband who retired or resigned.
In a statement to The Hoya, Dingell credited her education and the community at Georgetown with guiding her along the campaign trail.
“I have stayed very close to the Georgetown community since my college days, participating in projects and attending mass,” she said. “My relationship with Georgetown has provided me with a foundation to continually learn and seek knowledge.”
Troiano, an independent from Milford, Pa., is running to represent Pennsylvania’s 10th Congressional District in the northeast corner of the state to replace incumbent Republican Tom Marino, who has represented the district since 2010. A Harper Poll released on Tuesday placed Marino’s support at 58 percent, ahead of the 22 percent for Democratic candidate Scott Brion and 10 percent for Troiano.
A former Republican, Troiano explained that he decided to run as an independent in the wake of the government shutdown last October.
“I decided to run for office because we need to fix our broken political system and restore real representation in Washington,” Troiano said. “We will not be able to address any of the major issues we face, including our unsustainable federal budget and national debt, with continued partisan gridlock and special interest corruption.”
Troiano’s campaign, which calls itself citizen-funded, parades the slogan, “America Deserves Better,” particularly highlighting environmental sustainability, fiscal responsibility, economic mobility and political reform as critical issues.
“I am running as an independent candidate and refusing to accept any special interest contributions to my campaign,” Troiano said. “I believe America deserves better than politics as usual.”
If elected, Troiano, who is currently 25 years old, would become the youngest member of Congress, a title that currently belongs to 31-year-old Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.).
“It’s very important for young people to run for office so that our generation has a voice because we are the ones who are going to have to deal with the consequences of the decisions that Congress does or does not make now,” Rachel Vierling, press secretary and policy director for Troiano’s campaign, said. “We need to engage more young people in politics in general. Many are apathetic because they see a broken system with elected officials who aren’t doing what’s in the best interest of our generation, and feel helpless to fix it.”
Troiano nodded to Georgetown’s role in his success.
“My education in government at Georgetown taught me how our governing institutions are supposed to work,” he said. “My proximity to those institutions in Washington, D.C., showed me how they are not working. The gap between both our founders’ design and today’s dysfunction gave me the motivation to get involved sooner rather than later to help try to fix it.”
Known for her advocacy for reproductive and women’s rights, Fluke is running for the 26th District of the California State Senate, which encompasses part of Los Angeles County, including Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. She rose to prominence as a Georgetown Law student in February 2012 when conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh called her a “slut” for her testimony before Congress in February 2012 on the importance of birth control coverage in insurance plans, which Georgetown did not at the time provide. Later that year, Fluke spoke at the Democratic National Convention, calling for increased access to contraceptive and for equal pay for women.
Although she finished second, behind fellow Democrat Ben Allen, in the June primary election, Fluke will enter a rematch with Allen in the general election as a part of California’s “jungle primary” elections, which ensure the top two vote-getters in the primary will enter a run off in November.
Despite falling behind in fundraising immediately after the primary, Fluke has seen a recent surge in funds, reporting over $475,000 in contributions last quarter in contrast to Allen’s $300,000. According to a poll taken in September by the Fluke campaign, Fluke holds 41 percent of the vote, putting her seven percentage points ahead of Allen.
In accordance with her rise to national prominence, Fluke’s campaign has focused on reproductive rights and social equality as issues of focus.
“Sandra has devoted her career to public interest advocacy for numerous social justice causes, such as gender equality, education affordability, LGBTQ rights and workers’ and immigrant rights,” reads Fluke’s campaign website.
Fluke’s campaign declined to comment.
Twenty alumni, including 10 graduates of the Law Center, currently serve as members of Congress with six senators and 14 representatives. Senators John Barrasso (CAS ’74, MED ’78), a Wyoming Republican, and Richard Durbin (SFS ’66, LAW ’69), an Illinois Democrat, will both run for re-election this year, as well as the 14 members of the House.
Elections for the House of Representatives, as well as the California State Senate, will be held Tuesday, Nov. 4.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the honorary co-founder of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, spoke about the progress that has been made in women’s participation in business across the globe and the work that still needs to be done to close the gender gap in economic participation in Gaston Hall on Thursday afternoon.
The event, entitled “The Power of Women’s Economic Participation,” was sponsored by GIWPS and marked the re-launch of the International Council on Women’s Business Leadership. Founded within the U.S. Department of State by Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State, the council will reconvene permanently under GIWPS and will focus on women’s issues in international business and in international economic policy.
University President John J. DeGioia offered opening remarks on the goals of the council and their compatibility with the university’s values.
“The issues that the council will focus on deeply are deeply resonant with the mission of this university,” DeGioia said. “The economic empowerment of women, the promotion of gender equality, equal access to capital and markets and the building of capacity and skills all reflect our tradition of social justice, our commitment to equal opportunity and our dedication to the common good.”
Clinton began her speech by expressing remorse about the death of School of Foreign Service Dean Emerita Carol Lancaster, who died on Oct. 22.
“My thoughts and prayers are with Carol’s family and friends and the entire university community,” Clinton said. “She would have really loved to have been here for this. … She was instrumental in the creation of the first ever, anywhere in the world, Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security.”
Clinton went on to speak about the importance of encouraging the equal participation of women in the workforce.
According to Clinton, much of the work that women are doing around the world takes place in informal economies and is not taken into account in formal measures of nations’ economies. When she was travelling around West Africa as First Lady during the 1990s, Clinton observed women working in fields and marketplaces.
However, Clinton said that economists told her that they were not evaluating the contributions that women were making to the economies because they were not participating in the formal economy that can be measured by classic economic analysis.
Clinton stressed the importance of creating opportunities for women to participate in formal economies.
“It is true that if more women have the opportunity to participate fully in the formal economy, they, their families and their communities will prosper,” Clinton said.
In order to encourage equal participation in the workplace between women and men, Clinton said, certain barriers must be removed. She stated the importance of accessible child care and paid sick leave. Additionally, she said that in developing countries, many women do not even have access to basic sanitation, including toilets, in the workplace.
“We in this council are looking at everything from truly the most basic barriers that enable girls and women to go on to higher education, enable them to be in the workforce, away from their homes for some period during the day, all the way to how to get more women onto program boards and into executive positions,” Clinton said.
Clinton stressed that the economic benefits of incorporating more women into the workplace and ensuring that they earn equal pay extend to nations as a whole.
“If you look at the data, and I invited you all to do that, and we are going to be producing more data through the Clinton Foundation No Ceilings initiative, it is very clear that the more women that we can get to participate fully and get paid equal pay for equal work, the faster our economy will recover,” Clinton said.
According to Clinton, if women begin to participate in the workforce at the same levels that men do, developed countries’ GDPs could rise by as much as 10 percent and developing countries’ GDPs could rise by as much as thirty to forty percent.
Clinton closed by saying that she will work to ensure opportunities for her granddaughter, Charlotte, who was born last month, but that these opportunities must be extended to all people, regardless of their background.
“You should not have to be someone who goes to Georgetown, or in our case, the granddaughter of a former president who also happened to go to Georgetown, to be given the tools and to have the support of your community, as well as your family,” Clinton said.
Following Clinton’s lecture, GIWPS Executive Director Melanne Verveer (FLL ’66, GRD ’69), the former U.S. Ambassador-At-Large for Global Women’s Issues, moderated a panel discussion about women’s economic participation. Panelists included Cherie Blair Foundation for Women Founder Cherie Blair, Bank of America Global Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer Anne Finucane, former Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy and Minister of Trade of Indonesia Mari Pangestu and Chair of the Strauss Group’s Management Board Ofra Strauss.
Pangestu shared an anecdote about her experience in a village in Africa where, when asked how to delegate funds, the men wanted to purchase an antenna so that they could watch soccer, and the women wanted to use the money to install a pipe system so that they did not have to spend three hours a day getting water.
“It’s not just about women’s participation in the economy. It’s actually more basic than that,” Pangestu said. “It’s also about the decision-making from the beginning as to what the money should be delegated for.”
Finucane spoke about the different perspectives that women bring to corporate leadership.
“The women’s voices at the table have made a real difference. One-third of our board of directors is women, half the management of the company who are vice presidents and above are women,” Finucane said. “I do think that has made a huge difference in terms of just the conversation, let alone the progress we’ve made.”
Gaston Hall was filled to capacity, with several rows reserved for council members and for female ambassadors.
Halle Hagan (SFS ’18), who attended from the event, said that she enjoyed hearing from accomplished women about what needs to be done to promote gender equality in the workforce.
“I’m glad that measures are being taken in both developed and developing countries to expand opportunities for women in the economy,” Hagan said. “And we’re still on our way to ensuring that everyone’s labor is valued equally.”
Veronica Yam (NHS ’18) said that she appreciated the statistical evidence that Clinton presented about the economic benefits of including women in the economy.
“One point I liked that both Hillary and the panelists made was that not only is including women in the formal economy a morally right thing to do but that it would help the world economy as a whole,” Yam said.“I’ve never taken an Economics class, so I’ve always thought that encouraging women in the business world was only the right thing to do. It was nice to learn how it would actually improve the economy.”

Three anti-Catholic, born-again Christian preachers stood outside the university’s front gates reading gospel passages and trying to spread an evangelical message to about 50 onlookers for about an hour-and-a-half Wednesday afternoon.
“Your good works don’t save you. Trying to be a good person doesn’t work for God. You can’t be any better than what you are, because it compares you to God, and in his righteousness and his holiness, you are an object of wrath,” one preacher said into a megaphone. “Your heart is corrupt. You can’t meet God’s standards.”
The preachers walked onto campus around 12 p.m. and were promptly removed from Healy Circle by the Georgetown University Police Department. They then stood on 37th and O streets, outside of the front gates.
According to GUPD Chief Jay Gruber, the department called the Metropolitan Police Department because the demonstration blocked part of 37th Street. The group left at about 1:45 p.m. after MPD arrived.
“It’s very simple,” GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said. “They’re not a student group so they don’t have any access to rights or benefits on campus, so they had to be off campus.”
According to Gruber, MPD did not ask the group to leave, and no citations were issued.
The preachers, who are not affiliated with any group, have held similar demonstrations around the country.
“We go all over the country doing this — preaching to universities, campuses, community colleges and high schools. We’re just preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. We’re born-again Christians,” a demonstrator named Randy, who would not provide his last name, said.
About five GUPD officers were located near the front gates throughout the demonstration.
The demonstrators held signs citing gospel passages and handed out pamphlets entitled “Heaven or Hell?” and “What Roman Catholics Find When They Study Their Own Bible.”
“We just wanted to get the gospel out, and we’re doing it in a legal, appropriate way,” Randy said.
While the demonstrators said that they were not affiliated with any group, the pamphlets that they distributed were from Mt. Zion Bible Church Chapel Library in Florida and Pilgrims Covenant Church in Wisconsin, which, according to its website, encourages public evangelism.
The preachers tried to spread a message about faith that is different from the one offered by Georgetown’s Catholic tradition.
“I’ve been told a number of times, ‘We’re a Catholic University. We’re good.’ First of all, Roman Catholicism is not Christianity,” Sean, a preacher who did not share his last name, said. “We feel compelled to expose truth and to share the truth, not out of hatred for Roman Catholics, but out of love. Hatred would be to stick our heads in the sand and just let them go about their way.”
Sean said that the demonstrators aimed to share the gospel and to encourage onlookers to convert to Christianity in order to find salvation.
“We want people to be saved, we want them to repent and truly put their faith in Christ, but that’s not up to us,” Sean said. “God does that, and he does that by preaching of the gospel. We’re out here sharing the only hope for a fallen humanity.”
The preacher speaking into the megaphone said that people should not try to find salvation through Catholicism.
“It’s not the more times that you go to Mass that make you right with God,” he said. “Every time you go to Catholic Mass, they crucify Christ again.”
Around 50 students gathered around the front gates to watch the preachers.
“I’m kind of surprised that they’re allowed to use the megaphone this loud. I know that’s public property, so I’m surprised,” Zahid Syed (COL ’16), who watched part of the demonstration, said.
Patrick Bylis (COL ’17) held a rainbow flag signifying gay pride near the front gates for about 20 minutes.
“We kind of just wanted to create a distraction. We wanted to take away the hateful message that they were saying and reclaim it to make it our own,” Bylis said.
According to Bylis, the preachers were upset about the flag and called it an abomination of the rainbow that God sent Noah.
“It seems to me that they didn’t know who Jesus was,” Bylis said. “If anyone doesn’t know who Jesus was, it was definitely them because they were spewing a lot of hate, a lot of things that weren’t exactly the Christianity I know.”
Margo Poundstone (SFS ’17), who was standing near the front gates, led a group in singing Georgetown’s fight song and played music from her phone in an attempt to create a distraction.
“This just kind of pisses me off. I attend a Jesuit university not to listen to people telling people how they should and should not live. It’s just really stupid,” Poundstone said.

Ambassador Mark Lagon (GRD ’91), a professor in the School of Foreign Service, was selected as the new president of Freedom House in Washington D.C., an independent organization that addresses worldwide threats to freedom and democracy worldwide.
Lagon, the chair for global politics and security in the Master of Science in Foreign Service program, currently teaches courses on “Ethics and Decision-Making” and “U.N. and Global Institutions.” He will start at Freedom House on Jan. 2, leaving Georgetown’s teaching staff in order to fully focus on the new position.
“I think it is inevitable that I will come back and be a professor, and I think I need to concentrate on being the manger and leader of Freedom House and be ‘all-in,’ as it were,” Lagon said.
While at Freedom House, Lagon will help analyze political and civil liberties of each country, advocate for the spread of democracy and create policy recommendations for the U.S. government.
“[Freedom House] basically does three things,” Lagon said. “It puts out state of the art reports on political and civil liberties in countries around the world, it secondly does global advocacy and thirdly does programs on the ground in countries where there are autocratic or democratizing governments to help civil society bring about change.”
According to professor Robert Lieber, who served as adviser and thesis mentor for Lagon’s government doctorate at Georgetown, Lagon’s achievements and experience make him a good match for Freedom House.
“He is a wonderful asset to Georgetown, a superb teacher and a superb professional,” Lieber said. “His choice as the next president of Freedom House is really very fitting. Based on his political experience, Mark has got the gift of being able to work with people who have different political and partisan views. So it’s a great loss for Georgetown, but it’s good for human rights and it’s good for political civil liberties.”
Lagon has worked as the deputy director of the House Republican Policy Committee and senior professional staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as a deputy assistant secretary for International Affairs in the State Department and as an ambassador-at-large and director of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons for the U.S. government.
He has also worked extensively with the United Nations on issues of human trafficking and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
MSFS professor Katherine Gronberg said that Lagon’s vast experience with human trafficking will make him an excellent asset for Freedom House.
“Through his tireless work, he has helped raise awareness of the problem of human trafficking and has brought innovative approaches to the effort to combat it, such as fostering stronger collaboration with key private sector partners,” Gronberg wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Gronberg, Lagon exhibits a deep commitment to his students.
“His dedication extends beyond his philanthropic work to Gestudents have at MSFS and does everything within his power to help them get where they’re going after MSFS, MGronberg wrote.
Lagon’s student Sarah Grebowski (GRD ’14) said that Lagon dedicates himself to his students and their development.
“Professor Lagon’s reputation as a faculty member dedicated to students’ intellectual development and professional advancement is well known, but it simply does not do him justice,” Grebowski wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He has become a mentor to many students, myself included, in ways that far transcend the traditional role of an academic concentration chair.”
Grebowski said that although she is happy for Lagon, she will miss him as a professor and mentor.
“MSFS students are excited that he has decided to take this opportunity at Freedom House — we can think of no one better suited to advancing human rights and democracy abroad. However, he will be dearly missed in our community,” Grebowski wrote.

Despite the travel policies put in place by the Office of Risk Management prohibiting university-sponsored travel to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone in light of the outbreak of the Ebola virus, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions will not implement regulations on international student admissions from Central and West Africa.
Kathryn Timlin, associate director of admissions for the Africa, Europe, Middle East, Central Asia and Russia regions, said that since students would not arrive on campus until next fall, it is unlikely that international student admissions would be affected by the Ebola outbreak.
“As of now, we have no policy. It does not have an immediate impact,” Timlin said. “Because we’re recruiting for the fall of 2015 at this point, we’re 10 months or so away to worry about a student from anywhere, including [Western] Africa, coming to Georgetown and whether that would be perceived as an issue for our office to tackle.”
Historically, the number of applications from the region affected by Ebola has been low.
“We receive applications throughout the African continent, but the countries that are in question … are not producers of many international students,” Timlin said. “If we do end up admitting a student from that region who ends up being infected, that would be something that we would tackle from the provost’s office.”
The Office of Risk Management issued an updated visitor policy last week to apply the university entering campus.
Yohe added that admitted students who may have been at risk of exposure to Ebola would also undergo risk assessment.
“Our recently communicated visitors policy extends to all visitors, who within the last month have been in a country that is subject to a Level 3 CDC travel warning. This would include any visitors that would come to campus through the admissions process,” Yohe wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Additionally, although admissions officers travel to various regions to represent Georgetown, the travel restrictions did not affect recruitment efforts, as no plans existed to visit Central or West Africa.
“We have no planned travel to that part of the world, so it does not affect where we do or do not visit prospective students,” Timlin said. “With the admissions travel season wrapping up, there hasn’t been any worry over this.”
Earlier this month, CNBC reported Navarro College in Texas had not admitted at least two Nigerian applicants because of Nigeria’s history with Ebola. The two-year community college sent its applicants rejection letters that said that “Navarro College is not accepting international students from countries with confirmed Ebola cases,” according to The Washington Post. The college has since issued an apology.
Allan Goodman, president and CEO of the Institute of International Education, a nonprofit organization that promotes worldwide access to education and administers the Fulbright Program, warned against placing restrictions on admitting students from Africa.
“While each campus will need to set their own policies on admissions and study or research abroad based on the latest advice from national and local experts, we encourage campus leaders to ensure that their policies do not unnecessarily restrict the welcoming of students and scholars from Africa,” Goodman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Goodman pointed to previous crises that did not affect admissions processes, emphasizing the diversity of experience offered by international students.
“American higher education has shown through repeated crises, whether terrorism, disease or natural disasters, that we want to keep our doors open,” Goodman wrote. “This reflects our enduring values and the benefits that foreign students bring to our campuses.”
Vice President of the African Society at Georgetown Naa Adjeley (SFS ’16), who was born and grew up in Ghana, agreed that admissions restrictions caused by the Ebola crisis would be problematic and worried that even without an explicit policy, admissions officers might subconsciously choose not to admit a qualified student.
“In terms of admissions, I think Georgetown would have a hard time deciding whether or not to admit a brilliant Liberian applicant. The copout for Georgetown is that we already have too few Africans to start with, so Georgetown’s decision to refuse a West African student would go unnoticed,” she said.
In light of the travel restrictions and updated visitor policy from Georgetown, combined with national worries about the disease, Adjeley said she saw a worrisome trend in American reactions to Ebola.
“I think that just based on what we’ve observed over the past few weeks, Americans have begun to grow a strong sense of Afro-phobia,” Adjeley said. “I, for one, have not been back to Ghana since the summer of 2013, and was hoping to go to Ghana this Christmas to be with my family, but I’ve had to cancel my ticket for fear of being harassed both at airports and when I’m back here on campus. I suspect that I’d be asked to quarantine myself for 30 days, whether or not Ghana would have had Ebola by then.”

Despite measures adopted last fall after an outbreak of mold in dormitories across campus, mold has become an increasing problem in Village A apartments, leaving students frustrated by the housing conditions and concerned about their health and safety.
According to Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey, six of the 20 complaints that students have submitted about mold in the past three weeks have been about Village A. Last fall’s infestation primarily concerned Henle Village.
Danny Khanin (SFS ’16) was forced to move out of his Village A apartment due to health problems that he believed were caused by mold.
“I just kept getting sick so I didn’t know if it was from living there or not,” Khanin, a varsity tennis player, said. “Whenever I would leave I would feel much better and it started affecting my tennis and my schoolwork. I was able to move out and I’ve felt better since.”
Morey said that the university still is unsure of what is causing the current mold problems in Village A apartments.
“At this point we cannot attribute any circumstance that would result in Village A receiving approximately one quarter of the requests,” Morey wrote in an email. “However, as most of the work orders are related minor mold/mildew in bathrooms, we are inspecting the ventilations systems in the bathroom stacks at Village A, as this could be a potential opportunity to improve.”
Morey said that the highest volume of orders are related minor mold/mildew in bathrooms, we are inspecting the ventilations systems in the bathroom stacks at Village A, as this could be a potential opportunity to improve.”
Morey said that the highest volume of mold work orders came during move-in due to the high humidity at the time.
“During move-in we generally receive more work orders concerning mold,” Morey wrote. “This is expected as students include mold requests on the work order as part of other requirements that they need resolved as they first move into the units. Also the environmental conditions in the summer, high humidity days, are the optimal conditions for mold growth.”
Although Morey did not have data from the past few years because of the creation of a new work order system, he said that mold has become less severe on campus over time due to preventative measures.
“It appears we have experienced a similar amount of work orders relating to mold year over year, but we have seen a significant reduction in ‘serious’ cases of mold year over year,” Morey wrote. “We believe the operational improvements related to inspections and the physical improvements, installation of de-humidifiers are the reason for this improvement.”
The Office of Facilities Management has attempted to alleviate some of the mold problems by placing dehumidifiers in some apartments that remove gallons of moisture from the air per day .
“There’s a dehumidifier in our living room and it just obviously takes out some of the moisture in the air and I think that’s been a lot better,” Devon Wood (MSB ’16), a Village A resident, said. “It’s not really that bad anymore, except for the bathroom, but I think that’s typical. I mean it just requires probably more upkeep than a normal apartment.”
Khanin did acknowledge that the university took the mold seriously, providing him compensation for the issue.
“I think they took it seriously,” Khanin said. “They came in and cleaned it and we actually just got an email a couple weeks ago that they were refunding us a couple hundred dollars for the inconveniences, which was nice.”
Khanin, who shifted to an empty spot in a friend’s Nevils, said that his experience with mold incentivizes off-campus housing.
“I just think that the way they deal with problems in residences just takes too long especially with the amount of money they charge for them,” Khanin said. “If you ask any other landlord in an apartment off campus everything is resolved much quicker, everything’s in better condition, for the same price if not cheaper.”
Gus Campbell (SFS ’16), another Village A resident, said that the university took too long to respond to his work order, and he and his roommates had to clean the mold on their own.
“We actually did call and complain at the beginning of the year and they didn’t show up for a month and a half, so we cleaned it in the meantime,” Campbell said. “We pay too much to have to deal with this.”
Kayleigh Hauri (COL ’16) was disillusioned by the work order process, so decided to clean the mold herself as well.
“We didn’t talk to facilities partially because we put in some other complaints earlier this year and they marked them as completed but hadn’t actually come to our house,” Hauri said. “So we were worried about it being a health issue so we thought it would be faster if we dealt with it on our own.”
Concerns about mold in Village A extend to sophomores thinking about housing for next year.
“I would find it very unappealing to live in a place with persisting mold issues,” Sinead Schenk (COL ’17) said. “The university should really take responsibility to ensure that students live in sanitary conditions.”

Former Georgetown University Provost Jim O’Donnell was named as Arizona State University’s librarian Monday. O’Donnell, who is currently a classics professor at Georgetown, will begin his new position in February after over 12 years at Georgetown.
According to University President John J. DeGioia, O’Donnell’s work as a professor and provost greatly propelled Georgetown forward in its academic pursuits.
“Jim has had an extraordinary career as a scholar, professor and university administrator, serving Georgetown with distinction as provost and professor of classics for more than a dozen years,” DeGioia wrote in a statement. “As provost, he oversaw our academic mission with unparalleled commitment to excellence during a time of significant progress for the university.”
DeGioia said that O’Donnell will be greatly missed but will also serve as a valuable asset for ASU.
“We are deeply grateful for all that Jim has contributed to our Georgetown community as an inspiring colleague, leader, teacher, scholar and friend,” DeGioia wrote. “I know that his experience and deep commitment to advancing scholarship will greatly benefit the ASU community as they have for Georgetown for so many years.”
As university librarian, O’Donnell will work to fit ASU’s libraries into the rapidly modernizing world.
“My job there will be to point the way forward, preserving what’s important about what we have but building the new as well,” O’Donnell wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have a chance there to reinvent the spaces we work in, and that’s exciting, but also to reinvent ‘collecting’ books and other materials to take into account new technologies and new business models. It’s all exciting and scary, but ASU is also a very forward-looking and ambitious institution. I really like that.”
O’Donnell said that his experience as provost has helped prepare him for the job as a “soldier” in the academic world.
“Probably best to think of me as a soldier, engaged my whole career in the war on ignorance,” O’Donnell wrote. “Georgetown for me was a wonderful opportunity to lead a faculty of great, committed people to achieve more than we ever thought possible. The library world is different: We fight with different weapons in different ways, but it’s all the same war.”
During his tenure as provost, O’Donnell helped lead the President’s Initiative on Diversity and Inclusiveness. Additionally, he overhauled faculty compensation and helped to ensure a large increase in student financial aid.
This semester, O’Donnell is teaching a business administration course called “Learning to Think Globally,” as well as an Ignatius Seminar for freshmen in the College.
ASU Dean of Humanities George Justice was on the selection committee for the new head librarian, and said that O’Donnell stood out in the application pool. As provost at Georgetown from 2002 to 2012, chief information officer at the University of Pennsylvania and professor at a variety of institutions such as Cornell University and Bryn Mawr College, his vast experience in academia made him ASU’s top choice.
“Jim O’Donnell brings a vision for the future of information, a respect for the history and importance of libraries, and senior level executive experience to Arizona State University,” Justice wrote in an email to The Hoya. “No other candidate in our very deep pool had this very unusual set of talents and experiences.”
Justice said he hopes that O’Donnell will forge ASU’s libraries ahead into the technological age.
“I have very high hopes that he will have a direct impact on making our librarians even more useful to students, faculty and staff,” Justice wrote. “And beyond that, I believe his presence will invigorate research and education not only in his own area of the humanities but across the wide range of academic subjects that we pursue at ASU.”

The District Department of Transportation announced a two-year action plan last week to kickstart its implementation of MoveDC, the District’s long-term transportation plan that will guide infrastructure developments in the city until 2040.
The Georgetown area will see a number of changes planned as part of MoveDC, including a Georgetown station for the Metrorail, potential tolls or congestion charges for cars, repairs and expansion of the Key Bridge and improvements to bike paths, new trails and walkways. Sam Zimbabwe, the DDOT associate director of planning, policy and sustainability administration, warned that these long-term projects may not even be completed by 2040.
“It will be a tremendously costly thing and take a long time to build,” Zimbabwe said. “This is a 2040 plan, and I think we’ll be lucky if something like that happens in that time span.”
The two-year plan calls for the addition of bike lanes, sidewalks and increased automated features at bus stops throughout the city. DDOT will also commence bridge repair work and evaluate the city’s transportation infrastructure to lay the groundwork for their future developments.
“The 25-year plan is something that’s hard for a lot of people, including us, even sometimes, to think about. It’s a long, long time frame,” Zimbabwe said. “Through the action plan, we can start on the implementation of a number of the recommendations. Not every single one, but most of them are covered by actions in the two-year action plan.”
Mandated by the Federal Highway Administration, which provides much of the funding for D.C.’s transportation budget, MoveDC expanded DDOT’s plans for a city-wide transportation upgrade. The 25-year outlook aims to add a 22-mile streetcar system, a 47-mile “high-capacity” transit network and water taxis in Georgetown and the Navy Yard, in addition to improving existing Metrorail and Metrobus services.
“For this plan in particular, we kind of went further than what was required,” DDOT Strategic Planning Branch Manager Colleen Hawkinson said. “We really drilled down to make it a local, city-wide plan as well. New York City, San Francisco [and] Philadelphia have all recently undertaken local city plans, and we wanted to make sure that we captured both the requirements, as well as the local city needs.”
The improvements offered by the plan look to address D.C.’s exponential population growth and the subsequent stresses placed on the transportation network.
“The District, for the last four years or so, has grown by about 1,100 people every month,” Zimbabwe said. “And that increase in activity means there is more demand on all modes of travel. So, biking, people taking transit, people driving. If there’s not a coordinated, multi-modal plan that looks at all those together, we would have a lot of big problems.”
Cheryl Cort, the policy director at the Coalition for Smarter Growth, worked on the task force that helped put together the MoveDC plan and explained that one of its main goals was to encourage and facilitate the use of public transportation.
“We are really excited about the creation of this cohesive vision for the future of the city,” she said. “The Sustainable D.C. goal is that 75 percent of commute trips would be by walk, bike and transit, something other than [cars]. …We think that’s a great way to look at how we can give people better transportation services that also are going to reduce pollution and enhance health and address climate change all at the same time.”
Despite the funding concerns, Cort said that she believed that the new mayoral administration that would take office in 2015 would also support the plan.
“We need to make sure that our elected officials are supportive of moving this plan forward and providing the funding and support for the policies in the plan. We’re confident that we can do that,” she said.
Although the effects of the master plan will not soon be implemented, Georgetown Running Club Communications Director Jimmy Smith (COL ’17) said he believes that the plan’s long-term goals will offer the Running Club new running paths.
“It definitely is great for us,” he said. “It’s going to make more people run, which we always like to see, but second of all, it’ll be great to just give us more room and places to run around the city.”

Georgetown University markets to hundreds of thousands of consumers through advertisements placed by Georgetown’s schools in both online and print media outlets, but of the nine schools that comprise the university, only four use these traditional advertising techniques to reach students and build brand recognition, with no schools targeting undergraduate students.
The divisions of the university that market through advertisements to find both students and faculty members are the School of Continuing Studies, the McDonough School of Business, the School of Nursing and Health Studies and the Law Center, according to MSB Chief Marketing Officer Chris Kormis.
Kormis said that the university’s marketing practices are aimed at strengthening Georgetown’s visibility and appealing to new faculty, and consequently to prospective students as well.
“All of our efforts are to raise the visibility of the school, but in doing so to attract new students, the best and brightest kids that Georgetown attracts,” Kormis said. “It’s to attract new faculty, to raise our visibility among junior or senior faculty who might be considering taking a job at Georgetown to teach here,” Kormis said.
Many of the students enrolled in the Global Executive MBA program run by the MSB in coordination with ESADE Business School in Barcelona heard about the program because of the school’s advertising in The Economist, according to Kormis.
“We always place an ad, I’d say at least twice a month, in The Economist for the Georgetown ESADE Global Executive MBA,” he said. “Every student for that program is interviewed, and they’re asked, ‘how did you hear about Georgetown?’ So many of them say The Economist ad,” Kormis said.
Kormis attributed the 23 percent increase in applications for the MBA program to advertising and noted a spike in applications each time the school updates its advertising campaign.
The NHS has also heavily marketed its online Master of Science in Nursing program, Georgetown’s first-ever online degree-granting program, which debuted in March 2011. Since the program began, it has attracted 1,000 students in 46 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to NHS Director of Communications Bill Cessato.
“Our efforts to get the word out about the program are reflected here in the extraordinary growth of this innovative program that our faculty has worked hard to develop,” Cessato wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Although advertisements for the NHS and MSB have been featured in The Washington Post, The Economist, Bloomberg Businessweek and the Financial Times, the schools primarily use expensive online advertisements that allow for easy tracking of analytics and use algorithms to advertise only to those who would have an interest in higher education.
1.2 million people viewed the MSB’s advertisements on the Bloomberg Businessweek website and over 605,000 people viewed the school’s advertisements on the Financial Times business education pages last year, with search algorithms targeting specific users to view the ad.
“I would say we’ve been consistently promoting our programs since I’ve been here. But as it gets to be a more refined business, we’re getting smarter about how we do it,” Kormis, who started working at Georgetown in January 2009, said.
Similarly, 22 percent of students in the School of Continuing Studies’ master’s programs first heard about the program through Google, according to SCS Chief Strategy and Communications Officer Roseanna Stanton, which she correlated to people visiting the site after seeing advertisements for the SCS. Unlike the other schools that advertise, the SCS focuses most of its marketing locally with advertisements at Metro stations.
Though the school invests heavily in advertising, the plurality of students say they hear about the SCS through word of mouth.
“Word-of-mouth and SCS success stories are still the number one way that people say that they hear about us (29 percent), so while marketing is necessary and effective, our best advertisements are happy alumni who spread the word because their Georgetown degree helped them to achieve their personal and professional goals,” Stanton wrote in an email.
Despite its prominence among graduate programs, the undergraduate schools within the university still choose not to advertise, simply because they do not need to, Georgetown’s Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said.
“I think that the brand recognition [of Georgetown] is very high,” Deacon said. “Literally almost half of the students who apply to us, we actually don’t know who they are until they apply. They go to the website, they do all their information research on their own. Students tend to come to you if they know your brand,” Deacon said.
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions does not engage in any traditional advertising, although they do market themselves to prospective high-achieving students on the PSAT by sending them an informational letter about Georgetown.
Kormis noted even the MSB does not advertise to undergraduate students because its selective admissions rate, at 16 percent in 2014, ranks lowest of the university’s four undergraduate schools. The other undergraduate schools, along with Georgetown’s peer institutions, choose not to market for similar reasons.
“You probably don’t find very many of the better-known schools advertising. You’re not going to get a radio slot from Harvard saying, ‘Think of Harvard,’” Deacon said.
For the programs that choose to market, however, the administrators explained advertising as essential to attracting a strong and diverse student body at the graduate schools.
“The more interest we can attract to Georgetown McDonough, the more people who apply, and that really enables us to put together the best class,” Kormis said. “And that’s the point of the advertising: to put together the best class for Georgetown,” Kormis said.

Ruth Gavison, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a founding member of the Israel Association for Civil Rights, spoke about the Jewishness of Israel and its implications Wednesday in Copley Formal Lounge.
The event, sponsored by the Program for Jewish Civilization and School of Foreign Service, is the seventh PJC event of the semester.
In this lecture, Gavison focused on what Israel’s Jewish tradition means to both the Arab and Jewish citizens in Israel, as well as to Jews throughout the world.
Gavison offered a brief account of history in order to give a base for her argument. In 1947 the United Nations General Assembly made a resolution that the British Mandate for Palestine would be separated into two states, an Arab one and a Jewish one, and that each must make a commitment to respect the rights of the other group living in their territory. However, this resolution was not a conclusive solution to the tensions of the Jewish and Palestinian conflict.
“What was obvious in 1947, ’48, ’49 is not so obvious at all anymore and this is the challenge of the time and why I have to come here and talk to you about what is the meaning of the Jewishness of the state, what is the justification for that, is it okay for there to be a Jewish state and what are the implications of this identity,” Gavison said.
According to Gavison, Jews living within Israel and abroad have a political and ideological internal debate over the Jewishness of Israel.
“Among Jews in Israel there is a general acceptance that Israel is and should be a Jewish state, but there is a debate on the implication and meaning of the Jewishness of the state,” Gavison said. “Some people say the state must be governed by Jewish law. Others say most of the Jews in Israel are not religious and not observant and the Jewishness of Israel is about the right of Jews … and this is not about religion.”
Gavison spoke about the definition of the Jewishness of a state and its nuances.
“It is an ongoing conversation and the meaning of the Jewishness of the State is that the State is in part designed to allow Jews to continue to have this discussion and conversation on an ongoing basis,” Gavison said. “[It is not] to decide it once and for all, but to have the conversation within a political community, which has a territorial base on their ancient homeland in the only place in the world in which they were politically independent and the majority.”
Aditya Pande (SFS ’18) attended the lecture and was pleased that Gavison was able to make clear the core of the problem of the Jewishness of Israel.
“[There are] two states for two people, a Jewish majority state and a Palestinian majority state,” Pande said. “The only obstacle here is what is the Israeli proposal for right of return is, because if they let the Palestinians back into Israel that reduces the Jewish majority which they don’t want so that’s the solution.”
Pande said that he enjoyed the clarity of the speech.
“It was very clear,” Pande said. “She distilled her argument to one very simple point and that is that Israel should have a Jewish majority and should have self-determination. That’s why they were created. That’s why they exist.”
Also in attendance was Jonathan Morrow (COL ’18), who had attended previous lectures sponsored by PJC and was impressed with Gavison’s approach to the topic.
“It’s not just about external diplomacy. It’s not just about high level political discussions. It’s very much a grass roots discussion of what Jewishness means and what a Jewish society and government looks like,” Morrow said.

A panel discussed the history of institutional abuse against the disabled as part of the fifth installment of Georgetown’s Series on Disability Justice in the Edmund A. Walsh Building on Tuesday evening.
The panelists included Deepa Goraya, a lawyer with the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, Jennifer Msumba, a survivor of institutional abuse and a disability rights advocate and Shain Neumeier, a lawyer with Disability Rights New York. All three of the speakers were disabled. About 40 people attended the event.
The event was organized by Lydia Brown (COL ’15), who herself is autistic and a strong advocate for disability rights, running the website Autistic Hoya. It was a part of Disability Cultural Month.
“The impetus behind the entire lecture series is to promote greater dialogue behind different disability issues in a concrete way and in the context of diversity and social justice,” Brown said.
Goraya was the first on the panel to speak. She talked about the history of institutionalization in the United States and the two major court cases that have informed U.S. disability law: Buck v. Bell and Skinner v. Oklahoma. Both Supreme Court cases offered dissenting opinions on compulsory sterilization.
Goraya said that in today’s world, there must to be an emphasis on moving away from institutions and toward efforts to integrate the disabled back into communities in meaningful ways.
“We need to focus on thinking about de-institutionalizing people with disabilities in all aspects of life, whether it’s education, whether it’s discipline, whether it’s employment. Institutionalization is just not equal and it’s not effective,” she said.
Msumba offered a personal look at some of the horrifying conditions that exist in institutions. Since high school Msumba has been in and out of institutions, including time at the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center, an institution notorious for using electric shocks to reinforce behavior.
Msumba focused on the situations she faced at JRC, including abusive use of restraints and electric shocks, which she equated to torture.
“I had to earn [taking] a shower. They would touch me all over whether I said they could or not,” Msumba said. “And if I screamed, I got shocked, and they would go back to touching me some more. If I yelled or cried, I would get shocked, all while a camera in the corner of the bathroom was watching.”
Msumba said the longest amount of time she spent in restraints was after she tried to run into the road and commit suicide by being hit by a car. For two months after the incident everything she did from eating to using the bathroom had to be done while strapped to restraints.
“There is so much abuse of power,” Msumba said. “I witnessed it, and I experienced it. The staff would often threaten the non-verbal clients asking, ‘Do you want it?’”
Neumeier discussed the history of disability treatments in the United States and how places like the JRC came into existence. She also spoke about specific treatments such as electric shock and why it is allowed to continue to this day.
“In the early ’90s, they did add electric shock in order to avoid the staff putting their hands on students,” Neumeier said. “It was considered a less dangerous method of control. And most of this … they have been able to continue.”
The floor was then opened up to questions from the audience. Many audience members asked about how to address people who think institutional abuse is isolated to a few incidents, especially in terms of electric shock.
“Yeah, it’s only happening at JRC but these people are also human,” Goraya said. “It’s not okay to torture a human being and restrict their freedom. … You’re basically condoning torture.”
Brown organized the event alone, alongside a few sponsors, because she said that the university simply lacks the resources to put together Disability Cultural Month lectures.
“We don’t have infrastructure at Georgetown to have such programing,” Brown said. “For the past two years I have been advocating for the creation of a disability cultural center … that would fill the space for that need. As we have other diversity centers that purport to represent the need of and create safer spaces for particular communities, we don’t have such a space for disabled folks.”

Researchers at the Georgetown University Medical Center published a brief perspective urging the Food and Drug Administration to accelerate regulations that would decrease safety concerns of e-cigarettes in the New England Journal of Medicine on Oct. 16.
Nathan Cobb, an assistant professor at the Georgetown University Medical Center, and David Abrams, an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Medical Center and Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, also discussed the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a means for smoking prevention in their article, “The FDA, E-Cigarettes, and the Demise of Combusted Tobacco.”
Cobb and Abrams gave evidence that e-cigarettes could work as potential nicotine-replacement therapy, finding significant potential for growth in the product’s market. However, the researchers acknowledged that some manufacturers remained unsafe, requiring FDA regulation to separate the harmful products from the nicotine-replacement mechanisms.
“We’ve spent decades trying to get nicotine replacement products, like the patch or gum, into the hands of more smokers to help them quit, but never achieved our public health goals,” Cobb said. “E-cigarettes, despite their flaws, are a potential path to do that but only if we can guarantee the public that they are safe and will help them stay off deadly combusted tobacco products.”
Regulating e-cigarettes would require manufacturers to disclose ingredients, register their products and restrict sales to young people. The FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products previously explained that in order for e-cigarettes to be advertised as smoking cessation products, they would also have to be approved as pharmaceutical products by the FDA.
“Getting a pharmaceutical product approved by the FDA requires millions of dollars in funding, an experienced team and years of time. The small existing e-cigarette companies don’t have the resources to do this, only the big tobacco companies that sell cigarettes do, and I don’t think they are interested in the best interests of health,” Cobb said.
In April 2014, the Food and Drug Administration announced their initial intention to regulate e-cigarettes, which have been on the market for eight years, to raise them to the same level of cigarettes.
The battery-powered devices dispense aerosolized and refined nicotine using a humectant and liquid nicotine. In 2014, Americans will spend $2.2 billion on the product, more than on nicotine-replacement therapies and significantly less than on combustible cigarettes.
“The combusted cigarette market is enormous because consumers buy a pack or more of cigarettes every day for decades due to their addiction,” Cobb said. “As long as e-cigarettes remain no more addictive than the nicotine patch or gum then the market will remain small; if manufacturers are allowed to create highly addictive devices and sell them to young people then the potential sales could be enormous.”
The report expressed hope, with more FDA regulation, more widespread use of e-cigarettes would limit the demand for cigarettes.
“We would encourage the FDA to accelerate their regulations to eliminate uncertainty regarding safety, drive the substitution of clean nicotine and hasten the demise of lethal combusted tobacco,” Cobb and Abrams wrote in the article.
Georgetown student Charlotte McCary (COL ’17) agreed, noting that e-cigarettes would be even more effective by closely mimicking the procedure.
“I’ve heard that one of the most difficult tasks for people trying to quit smoking is replacing the routine that accompanies it,” McCary said. “While patches and gum can chemically wean you off of the need to smoke, it doesn’t seem like they would be very effective in channelling the urge to go through the methodical motions of pulling out a cigarette, lighting it and relaxing for a few minutes until it burns out. I could see how e-cigs would be a better tool for people starting to quit because they don’t force you to change your routine right away.”
Despite the potential effectiveness of e-cigarettes in smoking cessation, Cobb expressed his uncertainty about the current products and hopes e-cigarettes will continue to progress.
“At the end of the day, we don’t know if e-cigarettes are good or bad because we don’t know what they are. If I walk into a 7-11 and buy an e-cigarette, there is no law that says it has to contain nicotine, or even which chemicals can be used to carry the nicotine,” Cobb said. “What we believe to be true is that a manufacturer can create e-cigarettes that are safe and could help people quit, but without regulation we have no idea if specific brands or models actually do that.”

Edward Walker, the former U.S. ambassador to Egypt, Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and Startup Angels CEO Leslie Jump spoke on Tuesday in the Healey Family Student Center about the current state of affairs in the Middle East and whether high-growth, technological entrepreneurship can succeed in areas where diplomacy has failed.
Walker began by discussing American foreign policy during George W. Bush and Barack Obama’s administrations.
“When Obama was elected president, a lot of us wondered, in terms of foreign policy, where the United States was going to go and how we might pull ourselves out of a deep hole that we had gotten ourselves into over the past eight years,” Walker said. “I don’t want to be one sided, but we can’t deny the fact that the international community did not approve American foreign policies during the Bush administration, particularly regarding to Iraq.”
However, Walker said he does not believe that there has been a fundamental change in U.S. foreign policy since Bush’s presidency.
“Regarding the question of how we can defeat terrorism, much of our foreign policy has been based upon our military policy,” Walker said. “When you have that kind of continuity, your policies cannot change that much. The question is whether we are missing the point, that in fact there are no military answers. We are dealing with beliefs, misinterpretations of religious texts and the feeling of injustice that prevails. This is what our policy should focus on.”
Walker also said he believes that we are now living in a time of change that requires new strategies.
“We can’t use the same ideas, technology and techniques of diplomacy that we used to, because everything has changed so profoundly,” Walker said. “Many people feel that the Arab Spring was unsuccessful, in some ways it was. But in reality, it changed some very important things. One thing it changed was the belief that we can make a change. Until that time, people were resigned, but now people feel that they can make this change, and that changes the entire equation.”
Jump spoke about how her interest in the Middle East was sparked.
“What was most extraordinary to me about this was how these people were deeply disturbed by what had happened and how they were misunderstood,” Jump said. “The people here did not understand the potential for what was going on in that part of the world. That’s what I decided to do with the rest of my life, help the people in the Middle East realize the potential that they have, through entrepreneurial opportunities, specifically through technology entrepreneurship.”
Jump then discussed how Startup Angels, a program that educates entrepreneurs about investment, was created and developed to best aid entrepreneurs in the Middle East.
“We have been working specifically with how to help more people become angel investors, investors in these startup companies,” Jump said. “Also, how to help more people who are already active angel investors to invest in new markets.”
Jump then shared her vision of current Middle Eastern youth and said she has high hopes for their entrepreneurial future.
“When I look at the Middle East, I see a young entrepreneurial and unstoppable group of people,” Jump said. “That is why this is so interesting, as people tend to have a different view here in the west. But I think that more people are now starting to look at them with the same optimism.”
Andrew Jacobsberg (SFS ’15), who attended the event, said that he appreciated the participation of both speakers.
“I thought it was very interesting how this event brought together two different perspectives, which usually do not cross each other,” Jacobsberg said. “The discussion featured a perspective of the private sector, through Leslie Jump’s participation, and of the public sector, with Ambassador Walker’s words. I thought that the way both perspectives intertwined was extremely interesting and made me see the Middle East with different eyes.”

In honor of Veterans Day, chart-topping musical artists from Rihanna to Bruce Springsteen will take the stage at the National Mall for a concert Nov. 11. Hosted by Starbucks and HBO, the free concert is expected to attract as many as 800,000 attendees, according to Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
“Our goal is to raise awareness of veterans support organizations dedicated to education, health, and wellness, employment and reintergration,” Courtney L’Ecuyer of Starbucks media press relations wrote in an email.
Although the concert, called the Concert for Valor, will be held at the Mall, the National Park Service is not involved in planning the event.
“The National Park Service is merely providing the location for the concert through a permit to HBO,” Michael Litterst, Public Affairs Officer of the National Mall, wrote in an email.
A three-hour special, the concert will feature performances from The Black Keys, Bruce Springsteen, Carrie Underwood, Dave Grohl, Eminem, Jennifer Hudson, Jessie J, Metallica, Rihanna and The Zac Brown Band. Producers for the event include Jamie Foxx, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. Jack Black, Bryan Cranston, Jamie Foxx, George Lopez, John Oliver and Bob Woodruff will serve as hosts.
The concert will be live streamed on HBO’s twitter page and on the Concert for Valor webpage. Additionally, it will be played on TV on the HBO channel, open to nonsubscribers and iHeartRadio will stream the musical performances on the radio.
Although attendance to the concert will be free, the event will offer opportunities for attendees to donate to veterans service organizations.
“The concert will enable Americans to contribute funds or volunteer time directly to the many veterans service organizations that can help create successful transitions for veterans and their families. We have not set a donation goal, but we hope that viewers and attendees will embrace the cause and contribute generously,” L’Ecuyer wrote.
According to Genevieve Billia, public affairs specialist for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department for Veterans is not affiliated with the event.
Josh Grubbs (GRD ’15), the media director for the Georgetown University Student Veteran Association, praised the event, and said that he knew of several members of GUSVA who were planning on attending.
“This is another great opportunity that comes from living in D.C., and we are excited to have the chance to attend,” Grubbs wrote.
Although the event planners will be collecting donations, the event’s purpose is primarily to celebrate and honor U.S. veterans for their service.
“This isn’t a charity event; it is a way to celebrate our nation’s veterans and bring veterans together with the society they serve or served,” Grubbs wrote in an email.
In order to accommodate the mass influx of people entering the National Mall, Metro will provide more frequent trains at rush-hour schedule before and after the concert.
Georgetown students expressed their excitement for the upcoming concert.
“It’s inspiring to see how much power music has to bring people together, especially for such a worthy cause,” Jane Mikus (COL ’18) said.
Jessica Andino (COL ’18) said that she would consider attending.
“With artists like Eminem and Rihanna there, I would be interested in going for sure,” she said. “I think more younger people will be included to go, regardless of it being Veterans Day. They would just go for the artists.”
The concert will begin at 7 p.m., and attendants will be permitted to enter starting at 10 a.m. Before the concert, GUSVA will hold a Veterans Day Ceremony on Healy Lawn at 3:30 p.m.
[…] They, along with a long list of other celebrities and performing artists, will be on the Mall on Nov. 11 for the Concert for Valor. I will certainly be in attendance for this incredible (and FREE) concert, and there are a few […]

On Sunday morning, the Office of Planning and Facilities Management cut off hot water from New South Hall, Village A, Copley Hall and Nevils with no warning in order to make an emergency repair.
Typically, with a planned outage, the administration informs residents beforehand. In this case, the water outage was unplanned, according to Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey.
“The outage was required to make an emergency repair,” Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya. “On Sunday morning while monitoring the campus steam system, our utilities staff observed a steam leak on the steam distribution network at the west end of New North. The leak was significant enough to require an immediate outage to make the necessary repairs. The emergency repair resulted in loss of hot water in several buildings.”
According to Morey, the problem was immediately fixed and hot water was restored to student residences by late afternoon.
“After the emergency repair was made the affected parts of the steam distribution network were re-energized and all systems were back to normal,” Morey wrote. “As usual we apologize for any inconvenience that this emergency repair may have caused.”
Some students also complained of hot water outages on Tuesday.
New South Hall Council President Alexi Potcovaru (SFS ’18) said that he expects these disturbances since they are part of residence hall living.
“I wasn’t a huge fan of my cold shower, but all of us understand that’s the nature of living in a residence hall sometimes,” Potcovaru said. “I think we were more thankful that it was restarted relatively quickly.”
Alana McGovern (COL ’18) said that the lack of warm water forced people to forego their morning shower, which resulted in some negative consequences.
“After a night out with my friends, I was really looking forward to a hot shower in the morning,” McGovern said. “It was a very unpleasant shock when I was doused in cold water. Many of my friends decided to forego the shower and New South definitely smelled a little funkier than usual.”
Yonathan Teclu (COL ’18) said he decided to take the shower, since he was unsure of when the hot water would return.
“In the beginning, I thought it was just a phase, like someone flushing the toilet or something,” Teclu said. “But when I realized the water temperature wasn’t changing, I decided to just go for it. You get used to it. Sometimes a cold shower is a nice change.”
Emily Portuguese (SFS ’18) returned to New South in the morning after a night in the emergency room, but was unable to shower.
“After spending a night in the emergency room due to a bad viral infection, I came back to New South and felt gross,” Portuguese said. “All I wanted to do was take a shower, but I had to wait hours for warm water.”

Seven students have relaunched the Alexander Hamilton Society, a non-partisan, nonprofit organization that promotes debate on foreign policy and national security, after its absence from campus last school year.
President Benjamin Reiser (COL ’17) said the organization’s main goal is to encourage discourse about a variety of issues.
“We have no mission or agenda or party affiliation,” Reiser said. “Our main goal is just to work as a group of students on campus to create and hold these events where these ideas can be discussed and where these complex concepts can just really be put through a forum.”
The Washington, D.C.-based parent organization was founded in 2010 and oversees 49 university chapters and four professional chapters in Washington, D.C, New York City, San Francisco and Miami. Events hosted on campuses and in cities throughout the nation are intended to bring together students, faculty and other professionals. Individual chapters choose the issues and speakers they want to focus on, while the society exists as a way to facilitate and fund these interests.
Reiser said he was approached last spring about re-launching the Georgetown chapter, which fizzled after the 2012-2013 year.
According to Reiser, members of the AHS headquarters expressed interest in bringing the club back to Georgetown’s campus.
“We’re obviously one of the top, leading universities in terms of just having political or foreign policy discourse in the first place, but being in Washington, it can never hurt to have too much discourse,” Reiser said.
George Washington University and American University also have chapters.
Sydney Adams (COL ’18), the society’s co-director of publicity, said the Alexander Hamilton Society addresses the high interest in politics on campus in a more unbiased way than other groups do.
“I found that a lot of groups on campus were very much targeted towards one certain ideal, and if you really didn’t fit that mold, or if you had different ideas, a lot times it was intimidating to get those ideas across,” Adams said. “It definitely offers the opportunity for people to learn more about different views. I know, certainly, people might identify as a Democrat or as a Republican, but I think this really brings both groups together and offers a discourse that really isn’t available anywhere else on campus.”
The first event of this year, “Does the United States have the right strategy to defeat ISIS?” will take place Nov. 3 at 6:30 p.m. in Lohrfink Auditorium.
Georgetown government professor Matthew Kroenig and Stephen David, a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, are the scheduled speakers. Monday’s event is co-sponsored by the government department. The national society also sponsors speakers at events on university campuses.
Jeff Naft (COL ’17), the society’s director of events, will serve as a moderator for Monday’s debate. In developing the event and creating the questions for the speakers, he said he made sure all sides of the issue will be presented.
“Sometimes it’s hard, because people are marginalized or stigmatized to go one way or another, and we’re trying really hard to make sure that if we’re going to talk about a conservative thought on foreign policy, we’re going to make sure that we have a really good liberal counterview to it,” Naft said.
Naft compared the society to the Lecture Fund, which brings notable speakers, including former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, actor Kevin Spacey and investor Warren Buffet, to Georgetown.
“We are like the Lecture Fund of debates,” Naft said. “It’s our job to make sure that we set the topic and we set the stage and make sure we have really good, fair questions.”
The debate will also be the first test for the organization in increasing its campus presence, since the Student Activities Commission does not currently recognize AHS.
Adams and Paul Spezia (SFS ’17), the society’s co-director of publicity, both said that the group’s Facebook page, which recently exceeded 100 likes, has brought attention to the organization. In addition to social media exposure, Adams and Spezia plan to table and poll students to generate publicity for Monday’s event.
Spezia added that he is optimistic about turnout on Monday, due to general interest regarding ISIS, heightened by the excitement of election season.
Director of Logistics Max Rosner (SFS ’18) expressed similar optimism about student interest and said AHS is unique, even with existing foreign policy and debate groups on campus.
“It promotes debate between these leaders, not just that this person is going to present a 15-minute monologue and maybe take one or two questions. This is going to be much more engaging with world leaders,” Rosner said.

Michael Marshall, Editor of “The Korean Dream: A Vision for Korean Unification” from the Global Peace Foundation, and Jin Shin, president of the Institute for Peace Affairs and professor at Chungnam National University, presented talks on their vision of Korean reunification Tuesday. The discussion, moderated by Director of Asian Studies Victor Cha, took place in the Intercultural Center.
Marshall stressed the importance of a shared history to achieve Korean unification.
“Korean unification can be seen as an opportunity for Korea and Korean people to reconnect with their history,” Marshall said. “Their common and long history is one in which both countries can clearly relate with and share, beyond their recent 60-year division.”
Reunification of the two Koreas has been discussed for decades ever since their divide in the mid-1950s. However, since the Dresden Doctrine that South Korean President Park Geun-hye laid out earlier this year, scholarly and policy-driven talks have gained substantial momentum.
“Reunification is no longer an ‘if’ but ‘when,’” Cha said. “And the ‘when’ can be very soon, so it would be optimal to prepare now.”
Marshall added that students in the United States and outside Korea seemed to be more interested and engaged in such dialogue than actual Koreans themselves.
“I agree to some extent that people outside Korea are more interested in Korean unification than us,” Wookjae Jung (SFS ’15), a student who attended the event, said. “Many Koreans today think reunification is bad for us or simply don’t care, which is a big problem.”
Marshall and Shin agreed that it is worth debating specific policies regarding how best to handle the new unified country and how to better engage Koreans in this endeavor, but equally as important is the vision and principles that will guide that country forward.
“Preparation for reunification is not only for the various scenarios that might arise, but a vision for the new country that arises after reunification occurs,” Marshall said.
Marshall and Shin emphasized the importance of maintaining a vision during this tumultuous and unstable period in North Korea.
“I cannot stress enough how important vision is at times of transition,” Marshall said. “At times of extended social order, both within a country or the international system, the underlying rules and assumptions are accepted by everyone in that society. But at a time of transformation, vision can determine the ultimate goals and principles that guide you toward the future.”
Shin also referred to historical examples where a vision was crucial to creating a pathway toward a brand new system of government.
“The collapse of the Cold War era meant a significant change in the way people lived and thought, and this in turn meant some guiding principle had to lead them out of instantaneous shock and confusion,” Shin said.
Shin proposed that nations, as they become increasingly more interrelated, expand their interests to care about other nations, in addition to their own, for the future generations.
“This seems to be a bit naive, but when you think about it, it really might be that the reason such a realist world is taking place is because people make it that way,” Eddie Morles (COL ’17), who also attended the event, said. “If nations somehow start to build trust slowly but steadily, it might open up a whole new era.”
Shin acknowledged this criticism and added that despite the difficulty, more collaboration between nations will be the only way for nations to survive and coexist in the future, especially in a world that is already too interconnected to neglect a neighbor nation’s problem simply because it is “their problem.”
“It will be hard, but the key thing nations of the future must do is to change their national interests in a way that prioritizes togetherness with other nations,” Shin said. “It may seem too idealistic, but there will become a time when coexistence and cooperation is fundamental for each other’s survival.”
Marshall and Cha suggested that building this trust and social capital may start with civil society. The institution that may play the most important role in this transition period are the civic associations.
“There is a limit to what governments can do. They can provide health care and water, but they cannot do more than that,” Cha said. “When Korea unifies, the big question will be how to address what is inside the heads of North Koreans, and that will be something the government cannot do. What North Koreans believed to be true to this day will suddenly be gone. And that gap might be filled with new values with the help of such civil organizations and associations.”

Bassam Haddad, an adjunct assistant professor in the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, founded Jadaliyya four years ago in conjunction with several Georgetown professors and graduate students, and the magazine is now being met with increased readership.
Jadaliyya is an online magazine, or “e-zine,” that publishes content on issues of conflict in the Middle East and provides a forum for discussion between scholars and experts, published in English, Arabic, Spanish, French and Turkish. The site is updated daily, and about a third of the readership is in Arabic. Haddad is often quoted in media outlets as the main representation for Jadaliyya, although all the editors are hierarchically on equal standing.
Haddad said that Jadaliyya is unique because it blends academia and journalism to not only provide breaking news, but also insight on that news.
“Jadaliyya has been at the forefront of redefining what might be the ideal of cross-fertilization between academia and journalism,” Haddad said. “We are connected in organic ways with the local setting, with local writers, academics and activists, and this connection provides us with better analysis … and creates a kind of reporting that is often lacking in mainstream circles.”
Elliott Colla, an associate professor in the department of Arabic and Islamic studies at Georgetown, writes and edits for the culture section of Jadaliyya.
“Working as an editor at Jadaliyya means that you are constantly in contact with people who produce some of the best thought and analysis from the region,” Colla wrote in an email.
Colla said that the magazine utilizes sources from almost every profession and part of the world.
“In my work on the culture page, I regularly get to work with writers, journalists and activists,” Colla wrote. “I get to have long conversations with poets and novelists, established scholars and up-and-coming students. I get to see arguments and analysis being formed in real-time.”
Co-editor Hesham Sallam agreed, and said that the magazine has grown in popularity due to its unique and diverse perspectives.
“Given where Jadaliyya stands today four years later, with all the interest it has generated, the critical discussions it has provoked on a diverse array of topics and countries, some of which extend beyond the Arab world, it is fair to say that Jadaliyya has surpassed a lot of expectations,” Sallam wrote in an email. “It not only created a ‘dent’ in mainstream discourse, but also shattered it into pieces.”
Jadaliyya is also unique in the equal footing that it gives all of its editors, a team comprised of both graduate students and tenured faculty members.
Samia Errazzouki (GRD ’15) said that the lack of hierarchy in the magazine’s organizational structure allows for a positive mingling of ideas.
“My voice weighed just as heavily as everyone else’s, something that, over time, challenged and pushed me to step beyond my own preconceived notions,” Errazzouki said.
Errazzouki said that working on the magazine has helped her to improve in writing and editing.
“Even though Jadaliyya carved out this new space, it’s still the only publication doing what it’s doing,” Errazzouki said. “Working with Jadaliyya has made me better at what I do, both as a graduate student and a writer.”
Sherene Seikaly (GRD ’07), who received her master’s from the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, is a co-founder and co-editor of Jadaliyya and said that she believes it gives voices to those that may have otherwise been ignored.
“The thing that is most exciting is that it actually mobilizes voices that are able to speak to the contemporary moment,” Seikaly said. “It allows space for a different kind of analysis and for people to bring in their different expertise.”
According to Seikaly, Jadaliyya has become an excellent source for students and teachers alike who are interested in the Middle East.
“It has also become a very useful pedagogical tool because of the diversity of the kinds of pieces that we have,” Seikaly said. “For me it is very inspiring to be a part of a larger network in which we are really trying to think critically and leave space open for critical thought.”
Jadaliyya has gained influence in the international community, but also impacts Georgetown students and professors, according to Colla.
“Jadaliyya’s connection to Georgetown is deep and broad,” Colla wrote. “In our pages, we regularly feature the work of faculty and students. In fact, Jadaliyya is frequently a site for Georgetown faculty-student collaboration. The connection is not an accident — it reflects Georgetown’s longstanding strength in the field of Arab studies.”
