An independent arbitrator ruled in favor of the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees in an arbitration case with Georgetown University, stating it did not bargain in good faith over specific policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Jan. 19 decision resolves the collective bargaining dispute between the two parties, following the university’s formal denial of GAGE’s grievance motion Oct. 8 that alleged the university stalled negotiations with the union. After the issue moved to arbitration, both parties submitted documents presenting their respective interpretations of the union’s Collective Bargaining Agreement ratified in May 2020.The agreement officially recognized GAGE as a union and outlined contractual provisions. 
The union submitted demands to bargain with the university in July 2020 regarding health protections, wage security and unlimited paid sick leave for remote workers. After private bargaining sessions occurred in the weeks leading up to the fall semester, the union expressed its desire to resolve negotiations with the university in a written letter of agreement. GAGE submitted a grievance in September 2020, turning to arbitration proceedings based on claims that the university violated the union’s contract by breaking off bargaining over its fall reopening policies. Throughout the arbitration procedure, union members have organized protests and written letters to support GAGE in defending the contract. 
The university’s refusal to document their bargaining agreements in writing was a primary violation found by the arbitrator, Ira Jaffe, according to the Jan. 19 press release from GAGE.
“Mr. Jaffe further ruled that Georgetown violated its obligation to bargain in good faith when it refused to enshrine any agreements between GAGE and itself in a written agreement, calling out the refusal as “troubling” and directing the parties to document future agreements,” the press release reads. 
The arbitrator specified mandatory topics on which the university must return to bargaining with GAGE. These items include access to personal protective equipment, COVID-19 testing and vaccinations and subscriptions to health services, according to Ari Janoff (GRD ’24), grievance officer for GAGE. 
A crucial part of the ruling stipulates that policy proposals that arise in the future regarding graduate student concerns be agreed upon by both parties and not solely adopted by the university, according to Janoff.
“It is not sufficient for the University to unilaterally adopt Union proposals as University policies without coming to a written agreement with the Union,” Janoff wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Although the arbitrator ruled the union could not reiterate issues about reopening, graduate student protections, or COVID-19 policies that were already discussed during contract negotiations, the decision gives GAGE the right to return to negotiation regarding COVID-19 policies that they did not previously discuss, according to the news release.
“For its part, GAGE has already requested negotiations with Georgetown on COVID-19 workplace issues as soon as possible, albeit with a more limited scope,” the press release reads. 
The arbitrator’s decision also affirms the university’s right to implement policies, like the Community Compact, which lays out social distancing guidelines for the community members in the area, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a university spokesperson.  
“The arbitrator’s decision confirms the broad scope of the University’s management rights and prerogatives under the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) and recognizes that the University has the right to issue policies, including the Community Compact, related to the operation of the University during the COVID-19 pandemic,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The arbitrator’s ruling states that the university did not break with its obligation to bargain in good faith with GAGE, despite issues related to the Community Compact and the need to record certain agreements, according to the spokesperson. 
Jeffrey Tsoi (LAW ’23, GRD ’26), an officer on the GAGE executive council who was involved with the arbitration proceedings, said the arbitration ruling means the university cannot halt bargaining or sidestep reaching a negotiation with the union. 
“This empowers GAGE in future informal interactions and formal negotiations with the University,” Tsoi wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The decision should signal to the university that GAGE will fight to protect the rights of graduate workers, according to Zac Park (GRD ’22), who also serves as an officer on the executive council of GAGE.
“Aside from being able to go back to the bargaining table with the University, this whole process has also sent them a very clear message,” Park wrote in an email to The Hoya. “That message is that we will fight as hard as we need to to ensure that graduate workers at GU are guaranteed safe, just, and equitable working conditions.”

Georgetown University community members are calling for the university to suspend on-campus worker redeployment, citing safety and financial concerns for staff.
The Redeploy Georgetown program was initially introduced in August by the university’s Department of Human Resources as a voluntary program offering staff members semester-long public health-related jobs, such as health screeners, as a means to minimize furloughs, salary reductions and layoffs. 
Because of a recent policy change, however, the voluntary program has now become a mandatory reassignment, requiring some employees to either accept their new, in-person redeployment position or take unpaid leave without benefits, according to a Dec. 16 email obtained by The Hoya that was sent to nonunion and Alumni Admissions Program staff members.
“Effective January 14, 2021, if you choose not to accept your Redeploy assignment, you will be relieved of all duties (both of your primary role and of your Redeploy assignment) and placed in a temporary unpaid personal leave status,” the email reads. 
In response to the program change, 217 Georgetown community members, including members of the Georgetown University Student Association and the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees, have signed an open letter calling for the immediate suspension of the new Redeploy Georgetown policy. 
The letter, which an anonymous group of staff members delivered to university administrators Jan. 26, argues the university is in violation of the Just Employment Policy, which outlines the university’s commitments to full-time employees, and is endangering the wellbeing of its workers by sending them back to in-person work.
“Pressuring staff to conduct on-campus duties, which can include performing temperature checks for on-campus visitors and escorting COVID-positive students to quarantine, violates Georgetown’s commitment to protect staff’s ‘right to a safe and harassment-free environment,’ as outlined in the Just Employment Policy,” the letter reads. “The Redeploy Georgetown policy does not include exemptions for staff with medical conditions that make them especially vulnerable to COVID-19, forcing these individuals to choose between their lives and their livelihoods.”
Georgetown’s Just Employment Policy outlines the university’s commitment to providing full-time employees with a salary and benefits that compensate for all their health and financial needs. The policy also affirms Georgetown’s guarantee to provide a safe and healthy environment for Georgetown workers.
Beyond the health risks of working an in-person job on campus, unpaid leave also poses a threat to staff members’ overall well-being, according to a staff member who preferred to remain anonymous and will be referred to as Taylor to protect their identity. 
“Given the pandemic, not only would we be placed on unpaid leave, but all of our other benefits would have been disabled,” Taylor said in a Google Meet interview with The Hoya. “So we wouldn’t have access to health care, for example.”
Some staff members who were notified of their new, mandatory in-person reassignments Dec. 16 say the new policy takes advantage of employees who understood the Redeploy Georgetown program to be a voluntary option, according to Taylor.
“In my part of the university, it was very much the idea of a sense of camaraderie. Like they said, it was very much about being on a voluntary basis and if we had the time,” Taylor said. “It was also much more flexible in the sense that it was originally offered that if you could spare an hour or two a week, five hours, and choose your increments, and do what you can for your fellow colleagues.”
The university enacted the Redeploy Georgetown policy change to keep the university’s workforce fully employed and avoid potential employee impacts, according to a university spokesperson.
“Georgetown’s hybrid operational status in Spring 2021 creates new work involving visitor registration, wellness screening and perimeter access support. A small number of current employees have been redeployed to perform these roles on a short-term basis,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
All employees must also abide by the university’s COVID-19 protocol, including regular testing, mandatory mask wearing, daily check-ins and the use of access badges on campus, according to the spokesperson.
According to the Dec. 16 email to staff members, by opting for unpaid leave, employees lose access to health care and insurance benefits and dependent care, generating additional costs on top of a loss of salary.
Additionally, the policy does not allow for student Redeploy workers to schedule work around their classes. Student employees who decide to accept their reassignments may face disruptions to their education, while those who opt out of paid leave will be excluded from the Tuition Assistance Program, according to the email.
The university is ultimately sacrificing employees with minimal protections by changing the program, according to Taylor. 
“If you think about who got redeployed, we are the administrators. We are staffers. We’re not tenured faculty; we’re easily disposable,” Taylor said. “It’s just a very sure sign emphasizing how little they value us, that they’re willing to put us in harm’s way in order to uphold the safety, ironically, at Georgetown.”
According to another staff member who preferred to remain anonymous and will be referred to as Alex to protect their identity, the university failed to account for the well-being of its staff and their circumstances when introducing the new policy, especially because the program is intended for nonunionized workers only.
“There was no due diligence in considering staff circumstances either — not just their own safety, but their families’ safety, children, there was no consideration for anything,” Alex said in a Google Meet interview with The Hoya. “They just treated everyone like numbers and just randomly, well I don’t know how they did it, but picked people.”
After a marked increase in COVID-19 cases among Georgetown community members living on or near campus, the university introduced a more restrictive operating status as of Jan. 28, according to a systemwide email. Some in-person assignments will be adjusted under the university’s new status, as fewer campus buildings will be open and there will be reduced traffic on campus.
The letter also criticized the Redeploy Georgetown program for relying on Georgetown University Police Department officers to facilitate and supervise on-campus workers, another violation of the Just Employment Policy, according to the letter.
“Asking redeployed employees — many of whom are people of color — to work with police officers in the wake of police violence against Black people and people of color also fails to provide a ‘safe and harassment-free environment,’” the letter reads.
Over the past year’ students have raised concerns about GUPD’s role on campus. Last June, following nationwide demonstrations against police brutality, a petition demanding the university cease all relationships with any police department garnered over 8,000 signatures. Additionally, the Georgetown University Student Association Senate passed a resolution that called for the university to cease its work with the Metropolitan Police Department on June 7 and later unanimously voted to create a student advisory committee to oversee GUPD. 
Requiring Georgetown staff to work so closely with GUPD is stressful and potentially dangerous, especially for people of color, according to Taylor.
“The idea that you’re forcing your employees — especially there’s a disproportionate number of people of color that are in these positions with GUPD — it’s an abuse of power play,” Taylor said. 
The university should redesign the Redeploy Georgetown initiative to align with its Jesuit values of seeking care for each community member, according to GUSA Senate Speaker Melanie Cruz-Morales (COL ’22), who signed the letter.  
“I think that one of the most upsetting things, apart from the countless other things that have been brought on by the pandemic, is just how easy it is for companies and institutions to force their workers into environments that are just not safe,” Cruz-Morales said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I think Georgetown has the opportunity to set the standard for other universities, which is why it’s so important that they get this right.”

The University has a Nursing and health sciences school.  Why aren’t they using this resource?

The Corp has reopened two locations offering on-campus students at Georgetown University more options for food services, groceries and COVID-19 personal protective equipment. 
The Corp Cafe at Grounded, a breakfast food and coffee shop, and Vital Vittles, a full-service grocery store that will also be stocked with masks, hand sanitizer and cleaning materials, opened Jan. 27. 
After students who returned to campus last fall raised concerns about limited food options, The Corp hopes its reopening will provide more variety given that many university dining services remain closed or limited, according to The Corp’s Chief Operating Officer Natalie DePaulo (COL ’22).
“For the last 50 years our mission has always been to serve students,” DePaulo said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “We have been trying to fill that and kind of bridge that gap. I know one thing is not having a good breakfast place or even a place to get coffee on, and that is why we are so excited about the Corp Cafe because we have really tried to make that a breakfast and coffee place.”
The two open locations will implement a new online ordering system that allows students to order food and groceries online and pick them up outside of stores in order to reduce contact between customers and employees, according to President of The Corp Ryan Farrell (SFS ’21). Only students approved to be on campus will be working at Corp locations this semester. 
“That was really important to communicate to our employees that hopefully as conditions improve we’re able to offer more employment,” Farrell said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “But at the moment we just have to prioritize health and safety and follow Georgetown’s guidelines.” 
Natalie Rechan (COL ’21), who works at The Corp Cafe and lives in the Georgetown neighborhood, said she feels safe returning to work on campus because of The Corp’s new health and safety regulations.
“We have a lengthy health and safety guide that every employee is required to follow, and I trust that my coworkers will take it seriously,” Rechan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It took a long time for the C-suite and university officials to create a reopening plan, and I don’t think anyone wants to jeopardize this opportunity because we’re all very eager to continue working.”
The university’s COVID-19 regulations apply to students living both on campus and in the neighborhoods of Georgetown, Burleith and Foxhall. Regulations include regular testing, mandatory facial coverings and limited indoor gatherings, according to the university’s Community Compact.
The Corp has also implemented additional safety measures. Employees will have their temperature taken and will answer a health survey each time they come in for a shift, and both open locations will be regularly cleaned and disinfected between shifts and throughout the day, according to DePaulo.
“Everything that Georgetown has very thoughtfully had in place is a safety net, and then we also have our own built-in safety precautions that we put in as a second-tier check,” DePaulo said.
After 25 students living in the neighborhoods surrounding the university tested positive for COVID-19 over just several days, the university shifted to a restricted operating status as of Jan. 28, according to a university-wide email. The new operating status has suspended all in-person hybrid classes and restricted the use of Lauinger Library to students with special access until Feb. 15.
In accordance with its new operating status, the university has requested Vital Vittles close for the rest of the week to limit building access to students, according to an Instagram story post from The Corp. The Corp Cafe will remain open for now and will continue to accept online orders, according to the post. 
Despite the precautions The Corp is taking and the new dining options, some students fear the reopening could potentially be dangerous to the health and safety of the on-campus community, according to Gwyneth Murphy (SFS ’23) who lives on campus.
“Georgetown had 25 COVID cases this past week, and yet we are sticking students in harm’s way by reopening more public spaces and requiring that they man them,” Murphy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I don’t want to risk getting a student employee sick for the sake of more vegan food options, and that’s a sentiment I imagine a lot of students who have been struggling with dining would share.”
This story has been updated to clarify which students have access to The Corp locations.

After Georgetown University opted not to invite first-year students to campus in the 2020-21 school year, many first-years moved into D.C. hotels to recreate the dorm experience. 
While Georgetown originally announced it planned to welcome all first-year students to campus for the fall semester, the decision was reversed in July. Instead, the university offered application-based housing for students in unstable or unsafe housing situations. In addition to the application-based housing, Georgetown offered to host an additional 500 seniors on campus for the spring semester.
Students from D.C.-area universities made up 30 to 40% of occupants at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Arlington Rosslyn Key Bridge, according to Lilibeth Suico, director of sales at the hotel. 
“It’s like a mini university in a hotel setting,” Suico said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We tried to build a community here at the hotel where we were still mindful of the CDC guidelines, but it gives them the chance to recognize and see each other.”
The number of fellow students at The Georgetown Suites, an all-suites hotel that closed in Nov. 2020, was a pleasant surprise, according to Margherita Ceccagnoli (MSB ’24), who lived in the hotel with a roommate during the fall semester.
“You go take out the trash at the end of the hall, and you run into someone,” Ceccagnoli said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It was kind of nice to be like ‘Oh hey!’ and eventually you do become friends with them, obviously, because you’re just, like, trying to make new friends. So I really appreciated that part of it.” 
Although she feared living in a hotel might be a bit isolating, Ceccagnoli was happy to find a strong sense of community. 
“I mean, if people heard that you were from the Suites or something, and some people called it ‘The Hotel’ because it’s the Georgetown one, it automatically was like ‘Oh my god! We need to be friends,’ because you basically live together,” she said. 
In the fall, the Homewood Suites hosted a socially distanced welcome gathering to facilitate relationships with hotel staff and fellow student residents, according to Suico. 
“They get a feel of safety, a feeling also of family, a feeling of home, and then they get to meet other students,” Suico said. “We tried to also allocate certain floors for the students, so at least they feel like, you know, they feel like this is a student floor so they get to see each other a little more often because they’re just a few doors apart.”
The COVID-19 pandemic hit the hospitality industry particularly hard, leaving hotels like the Homewood Suites grateful for student residents, according to Suico. 
“I would say about 75% of our staff got furloughed because of the pandemic,” Suico said. “This allowed us to bring back some of our staff. In particular, the housekeepers and food and beverage servers, you know, because we have to do breakfast because it’s part of our rate — breakfast is included. So it was very, very welcome.”
Students also found ways to make the space feel more personalized, according to Ceccagnoli. 
“I did rearrange,” Ceccagnoli said. “We rearranged a lot of the apartment. Like my room for example, it was pretty boring, obviously, just like a hotel room. So I took down all of the ugly paintings and pictures, so I was able to rearrange it and tried to make it as cozy as possible.” 
While hotel life might have felt like living in a dorm at times, stricter rules mandated by the hotel management still applied, according to Bo Ziegler (NHS ’24), who lived at The Georgetown Suites.   
“There were extra rules that could be enforced by the hotel like noise-level curfews, and we had to very much stay well below the people-per-room limit that D.C. is enforcing,” Ziegler said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
The Homewood Suites distributed the Hilton’s CleanStay program guidelines and expectations to ensure students adhered to CDC guidelines and remained healthy, according to Suico. Safety measures included socially distanced seating, contactless check-in and increased cleaning and sanitization. 
Despite the disappointment of not living on campus, staying at the hotel provided for a positive experience overall, according to Ceccagnoli.
“I’m super thankful that I was even able to come out here and do this — basically live in a dorm-like feeling,” Ceccagnoli said. “It was fun to just be independent. Like if I think about me being at home with my parents … you know, this is just like such a better option. So basically even though it was horrible that we weren’t on campus, I wouldn’t really trade it because I made really good friendships regardless.”

Lilibeth has been an amazing coordinator at the Homewood Suites, making the kids feel very welcomed and safe!

If the administration truly cared about safety, these First Years would be living in the campus bubble and tested regularly vs. shacking up in neighboring hotels and left to fend for themselves.

Lou Ser says 
February 4, 2021 at 12:06 pm
If you really cared about students, you wouldn’t advocate sending them to a hotel that now magically specializes in a “residential experience” during a pandemic… I’m sure “Lilibeth” at the Suites with her hospitality experience FULLY recognizes and understands the issues first-year residential students have…

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) lifted a month-long ban on indoor dining in the District on Jan. 22, allowing restaurants to open indoors at 25% capacity.
The ban on indoor dining was implemented Dec. 23 to curb the spread of the coronavirus as infections and hospitalizations spiked around the country. While the pause on indoor dining was initially set to expire Jan. 15, Bowser extended it by another week because of safety and security concerns stemming from the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.
Indoor seating has helped increase business amid struggles caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Brian Yousefi, owner-chef of City Sliders on Wisconsin Avenue. 
“We’re excited finally we can have indoor seating because, before that, it was very difficult,” Yousefi said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “When the weather is nice outside, people are outside and they like it. But when the weather’s not, it’s really hard to keep people outside again.” 
City Sliders, which opened in October, offered outdoor seating during December through the Georgetown Business Improvement District’s streateries program, according to Yousefi. City Sliders has implemented safety measures to limit health risks, Yousefi said, and staff regularly sanitize surfaces as well as use a high-heat dishwasher to eliminate germs. 
The lift of the indoor dining ban arrives during a period of significant strain on local businesses, according to Rachel Shank, the executive director of Georgetown Main Street.
“It is a difficult time to own an independent restaurant,” Shank wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The combination of cold temperatures and the pause on indoor dining really squeezed restaurants these past few weeks.”
The reopening will benefit neighborhood restaurants that are struggling during the winter months of the pandemic, according to Shank.
“If the health experts say indoor dining at 25% capacity is safe, then we are here to help restaurants adhere to those guidelines and promote those businesses offering indoor dining,” Shank wrote.
While innovative outdoor dining setups including heaters, tents and individual dining bubbles came as a welcome new addition to D.C.’s dining culture, the return to indoor dining is beneficial for restaurant owners, according to Shank.
“The parklets and streateries have really created a whole new atmosphere for restaurants that we are happy to see continue through 2021,” Shank said. “That said, the reopening of indoor dining will certainly mean more revenue for those restaurants that don’t just prepare meals but also curate a whole experience for their customers.”
The decision to reopen indoor dining comes as the District experiences record rates of COVID-19 infections. Last week, the city averaged 29.3 new cases per 100,000 residents, and city health data shows that D.C. hospitals are at approximately 90% capacity.
Cases city-wide are trending downward from earlier this month, but the case rate is still higher than the peak of the first surge in spring 2020. The city’s rollout of vaccinations for adults aged 65 and older has come under fire for inequity in distribution and supply shortages. 
While the remaining winter months will be difficult for business, there is hope that bringing back indoor dining will offer some reprieve, according to Yousefi.
“At least even with a 25% capacity, it’s still better than nothing,” Yousefi said.

Spring transfer students have begun their first semester at Georgetown University, adjusting to a new school in the middle of the academic year and in a remote setting.  
Many students said they chose to transfer to Georgetown because of difficulties from the COVID-19 pandemic, saying they wanted to be closer to home or avoid border closures. The university accepted 132 transfer students for spring 2021, according to a university spokesperson. Georgetown only began to accept spring transfer students in recent years, according to the university website. The decision to open applications for spring transfer students is made on a yearly basis. 
The spring 2021 New Student Orientation was held virtually over Zoom for transfer students. Programming took place from Jan. 21 to Jan. 23 and included panels on social justice and community engagement, as well as special evening programs and smaller group meetings.   
Each student was placed in an orientation group of eight to 10 students that met regularly over the course of the three days. The small orientation groups made it easier to meet new people and facilitated a more comfortable transition process, according to Genevieve Grenier (MSB ’24), who transferred from McGill University in Canada.  
“I think they did a good job of putting us in small enough groups where we could actually talk to people more than once,” Grenier said in a FaceTime interview with The Hoya. “Honestly as far as the academic adjustment and getting into the system, they did a really good job; it was all a very quick turnaround.” 
Grenier, who lives in Washington, D.C., is hopeful she will be able to connect with people in person this semester, something she couldn’t do last semester after Canada closed its border with the United States because of rising in COVID-19 cases.
“I’ve met a few cool people over orientation on Zoom, but what I’m really excited for is to hopefully socially distance meet people in the city, in a park, because last semester all my friends were across a closed border,” Grenier said.    
Morgen Ingerson (COL ’24) transferred from Wake Forest University in North Carolina after finding the culture in the South too different from her home in Albany, N.Y. Ingerson said the communal experience of NSO, which Wake Forest did not offer, allowed her to get to know some of her classmates and get a sense of the Georgetown community before classes started.  
“I really liked that it was definitely very interactive, and we were able to meet other transfer students,” Ingerson said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “At my previous school, the orientation was all asynchronous. So you just did modules on Canvas and took quizzes, so I never really got to meet fellow students and really get to know what the community was like.”
Ingerson also found the panels and speakers at NSO to be good resources for new students. Featured events included the academic deans’ assemblies, the racial justice panel, and other social programming. 
“They had a good balance of informative panels, because different departments from the school, as well as student experiences of people who have transferred or just who go there now and just really enjoyed their experience” Ingerson said.  
NSO organizers selected the panels and speakers based on their aim to increase the sense of community between transfer students and strengthen their connections to Georgetown, according to spring 2021 NSO coordinator Brendan Omaña (SFS ’23).
“The messaging and focus of this NSO (aside from the normal topics) was definitely geared towards community and fostering interpersonal connection despite operating in a virtual environment,” Omaña wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The staff, panels, and speakers definitely tried to foster new students’ connection to the community and make them feel like true Georgetown students despite many of them never having been to campus and many unfortunately not having a strong connection to the university yet.”
Despite being disappointed that Georgetown classes will be held virtually in the spring, Ingerson said the remote semester will alleviate the stress of living on a college campus during a pandemic, which she experienced in her first semester at Wake Forest.
“Having to wear masks all the time and get randomly tested, that adds a lot of stress to the college process that’s already pretty brand new as a freshman,” Ingerson said. “So I’m disappointed in my whole college experience not being able to go, but I understand this semester why it’s better to just stay home.”
However, some international students struggled to attend NSO events because of time zone differences, including Erica Oh (SFS ’23), who currently lives in South Korea.
“We had parts that were mandatory, but the optional ones that were at 7 p.m. EST, I was sleeping because I stayed up till 5 a.m. to do the rest,” Oh said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It wasn’t ideal because I’m a mid-year transfer and I’m also a sophomore transfer, so I wanted to meet as many people I could, but having NSO and everything else online was kind of tough.”
All NSO panels were recorded for students experiencing time zone difficulties, according to Omaña.
“We recorded all panels to ensure that all students had the opportunity to watch and engage in the programming if their time zone made attending the live sessions difficult!” Omaña wrote.
When students can return to campus, more bonding events for 2021 spring transfers would help with the transition to Georgetown life, according to Oh.
“I think they definitely should do a new student lunch or something for us to help meet people when we’re all in person because it’s different, and I feel that would be so helpful because I literally haven’t met that many people,” Oh said. 
Although worried about being able to establish relationships with fellow students in a virtual environment, Ingerson is hopeful the connections she made at NSO will last.
“I’m a little worried about not being able to make connections with people, but I was able to have a good NSO with some first-years, and I have a couple friends I can reach out to now,” Ingerson said.
