A student’s dorm room in Harbin Hall was burglarized at 9:40 p.m. Thursday night, according to the Department of Public Safety.
The victim returned to his room after using the restroom and found that his iPad, MacBook Pro and an undetermined amount of U.S. currency had been stolen, according to a public safety alert emailed to the campus community on Friday. There were no signs of a forced entry.
DPS also reported that an unidentified male suspect had been suspiciously looking around the rooms on that floor of the residence hall earlier that night.
The suspect is described as a black male about 19 to 21 years old who is about five feet eight inches to five feet 10 inches tall. He has a thin build and wearing a black hooded jacket, blue jeans rolled at the cuffs, black boots and a navy blue baseball cap with a red bill.
DPS and the Metropolitan Police Department canvassed the area looking for the suspect after the incident was reported, but they were unable to find him.
This incident is the second laptop theft this month, following more than 150 incidences of theft and 25 incidences of burglary for the 2010-2011 academic year. DPS and MPD are working on the ongoing investigation.
DPS representatives declined to comment.
