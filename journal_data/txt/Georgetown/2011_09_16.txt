Georgetown dropped one spot in the U.S. News and World Report college rankings Tuesday, coming in at 22nd on the annual list after swapping spots with the University of California, Berkeley.
In a separate list of rankings based on high school counselor evaluations, Georgetown slipped from sixth to a tie for ninth. Georgetown also ranks 26th on a list of “Best Value” schools.
University administrators gave little credence to the magazine’s latest evaluations, however.
“[The U.S. News rankings] are just their opinion based on a random set of numbers,” said Charles Deacon, dean of undergraduate admissions.
University Provost James O’Donnell agreed, saying the rankings fail to tell the whole story.
“It would be inappropriate for us to change our behavior just because we want our ranking to change, because they are such an imperfect science,” O’Donnell said. “At the same time, because they have a large visibility, it would be silly for us not to pay any attention to them at all.”
O’Donnell said he still believes the top-25 status remains a significant distinction, as it helps in donation solicitation and faculty recruitment.
“If you’re right around 20th, you could really belong anywhere from 15th to 25th,” O’Donnell said. “The basket of universities that we’re more or less clumped with on the list feels about right.”
Deacon said that he considers Georgetown a top-10 school, citing in-house analysis on how the university fares when accepted students are choosing between it and other institutions.
“We will beat every school except one that’s ranked ahead of us between 11 and 21,” Deacon said. “That’s why we don’t worry so much about these rankings. It turns out that the schools that we have the greatest overlap with in terms of admitting students where it was a close competition is Duke and Penn.”
To calculate the rankings, U.S. News uses a complex formula that weighs many factors including peer evaluations by other universities, high school counselor ratings, freshman retention rate, six-year graduation rate, class sizes, faculty pay and credentials, admissions selectivity and financial resources.
One of the biggest inhibiting factors for Georgetown’s U.S. News ranking is its relatively small endowment. At just over $1 billion, Georgetown’s endowment amounts to the smallest among top-25 schools.
“We’re very proud of the fact that we use our dollars well,” O’Donnell said. “We like to say that we punch above our weight. I think it’s a mark of achievement that we get to be a top-25 school with the amount of money that we have.”
Another category of “academic reputation” is calculated through surveys given to university administrators and high school counselors. Each university’s president, provost and dean of admissions is given a survey, although Deacon and O’Donnell said they decline to participate.
“When I get that survey and am asked to rank Alabama State University, I know nothing about that,” Deacon said. “I’ve been advocating for more high school counselor evaluations for a long time because they know a lot more about different colleges than we do. That’s their job.”
Critics of the ranking have long noted that there are ways for universities to game the system. Deacon said that Georgetown does not engage in such activity, but he noted how easily admissions data can be manipulated.
For example, under its Early Action admissions system, Georgetown has an 18 percent freshman acceptance rate. According to Deacon, if the university were to switch to the binding Early Decision system utilized at many other institutions, the acceptance rate would drop to around 13 percent. Using the Common Application — which Georgetown does not do — is another way to expand applicant pools and deflate acceptance rates.
“It seems our applicants don’t buy into these U.S. News ratings,” Deacon said.
However, he added that he worries that the rankings misrepresent Georgetown to students who may not have as much access to other information about colleges.
“Unfortunately, we also want more of the students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who don’t have as much guidance, and to them we say that we’re underrated,” he said.

After smelling gas in Maguire around 11 a.m. this morning, university officials evacuated students from Healy Hall and Maguire.
Both buildings have since been reopened after the scene was deemed safe by the D.C. Fire Department and hazmat officials around 1 p.m.
According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, the D.C. Fire Department and hazmat officials deployed to the scene discovered that a petroleum based odor was emanating from the sewer area outside of the Maguire and Healy buildings.
D.C. Fire and EMS Spokesman Pete Piringer said that the odor was a result of a fuel spill that had mitigated into fumes.
Library walk was roped off with caution tape at the time, and students with classes in Maguire were told to contact the Registrar for the status of their classes.
According to Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J., who was teaching his 11 a.m. Problem of God class in Maguire today, the fire alarms went off in the building around 11:20 p.m. After relocating his class to the lobby of New South, he sent an email to his 12 p.m. class to reassign their class’s room location. Soon after, he discovered that the Registrar’s office had already accommodated the evacuation switch-up.
“I assumed there wasn’t going to be a back up plan,” Steck said. “I’m impressed that the Registrar’s Office was able to respond as quickly as they did.”

Bowing to economic pressure, The Corp has increased its bargain bin $1 price for 20-ounce soda by 25 cents.
Last year, the D.C. government instituted a six percent tax on all sodas, sports drinks and other non-alcoholic sweetened beverages. The Corp, a student-owned company that operates several coffee houses and convenience stores, announced at that time that it would absorb the price hike and keep the price of sodas at $1 in their stores.
“Something that often gets overlooked about the [dollar] coke is that it has been at [its price] for the better part of 10 years. In that time, the overall price of carbonated beverages in urban areas has increased by around 25 to 30 percent” said The Corp’s Chief Financial Officer Scott Munro (COL ’12).
Munro reports no noticeable drop in demand for the 20-ounce beverage despite the price increase, but some students were unsatisfied with the change in tone from last year.
“[The Corp] had that whole campaign last year, ‘We eat the tax, because we care,’ and then they changed it. You might as well buy it from a vending machine,” Kathleen MuCullough (SFS ’12) said.
Munro cited general inflation and the six percent tax on sodas as factors that ultimately became too expensive to keep the soda at its low price tag.
“When pricing our products we always, always, always keep the Georgetown community in mind. Sometimes we have a choice in the matter and sometimes we don’t,” Munro said.
According to Munro, 20-ounce sodas priced at a $1.25 are still a great deal compared to prices in the surrounding area. At the University Bookstore and Epicurean and Company, soda prices run at $1.49, while campus favorite Wisemiller’s Grocery and Deli charges $1.89.
Other items facing price increases are Frito-Lay chips, which will be increasing by 10 cents after the parent company’s mandate.
“[Raising some prices was] not a decision we made lightly, but I feel confident that it was the best decision not only for The Corp but for the community as well,” Munro said. “If we aren’t profitable for too long we can’t give back in the same way. … As we do better, the impact our company will have can only increase.”
Reza Handley-Namavar (MSB ’12) said the price hike hasn’t affected his buying habits.
“It’s not that big of a total increase,” he said.

Students and other job seekers looking to enter the business world are up against an overwhelming degree of favoritism in the workplace, according to a study released by the McDonough School of Business last month.
Through online interviews with over 300 senior business executives, researcher and graduate student Jonathan Gardner found that subjective measures still play a major role in executive promotions today.
“The world is still imperfect. People don’t always get the promotions they deserve,” said Professor Lamar Reinsch, Gardner’s instructor at the MSB. “We think that’s a shame, but we also think that’s the reality.”
Though 94 percent of those polled said that their company has policies to avoid favoritism, more than half said they already knew whom they wanted to promote before seeing other candidates.
Almost all of those executives — 96 percent in total — said that they ended up promoting the favored employee.
Despite these statistics, most executives were unwilling to acknowledge possible bias in their own workplace conduct.
While 92 percent of the executives said that favoritism occurs in most large organizations, only about one quarter of them admitted to practicing favoritism.
The study originally served as Gardner’s capstone project for his executive master’s in leadership program at the MSB, a program designed to be a launching point for graduate students’ careers in business.
“[The project] is an opportunity for students to integrate all of their learning from the program into a topic of personal or professional interest and often serves as a catalyst for further leadership development, even after the program ends,” said Melissa Trotta, the associate dean of executive education at the MSB.
Gardner is now the chief operating officer and senior managing director at Penn Schoen Berland, a research firm specializing in political polling.
Reinsch expressed confidence in the study’s conclusions, saying that he hoped it would have an impact in the business world.
“[Gardner] and I would both hope that it stimulates people in all sorts of organizations to think about the process they use for promotions at the senior level,” he said.
Reinsch added that the results of the study also pointed to several areas employees should focus on to increase their chances of climbing the job ladder
“Work on being very competent, preparing yourself to do your job well,” he said. “It is also a good thing to have a good relationship with your supervisor.”
He advised those entering the workforce to use the results of the study to better their performance rather than be discouraged by the findings.
“Most of us at some point in our careers are going to be victims of a decision that is less than perfect,” said Reinsch. “But that’s not going to happen most of the time.”
Gardner could not be reached for comment.

Although The George Washington University recently cut its Collegiate Readership Program due to lack of interest, Georgetown’s own service will not suffer the same fate any time soon.
According to The GW Hatchet, GWU ended the USA Today-sponsored service, which provides free daily copies of The New York Times, The Washington Post and USA Today to students, in late August due to budget cuts and a lack of student interest in the program.
The Georgetown University Student Association restarted Georgetown’s subscription to the same program last spring, distributing papers in Lauinger Library, Red Square and Sellinger Lounge, after its suspension in Fall 2010. By financing the $12,500 service out of its own pocket, GUSA provides the program with a reliable source of funding that it lacked in previous years. It is an investment that GUSA leaders say they plan to continue making on a yearly basis as long as the service remains popular with students.
According to Tyler Sax (COL ’13), a Finance and Appropriations Committee member who was instrumental in negotiating the contract with USA Today, bringing the Collegiate Readership Program completely under GUSA’s budget has been the key to the service’s sustainability. In previous years, the program had relied on contributions from multiple student groups.
“We wanted to make it something line-item in the budget, so that it would be here year to year,” Sax said. “With the Student Activities Fee Endowment reform, it was something we were able to do without taking away from other student activities.”
While funding for the service is no longer a problem, many students have questioned the value of bringing the program back given the increasing tendency of students to get their news online. The results of a survey conducted by Interhall in Fall 2010 showed that under 50 percent of students had been in favor of reinstating the subscription.
Jed Feinman (COL ’12), a former GUSA presidential candidate, believes student money should be spent on services other than the distribution of print media throughout campus.
“If the majority of Georgetown students read media on the web, they should most certainly have to pay for it themselves,” Feinman said.
Despite the increasing use of online news services, the free papers have been extremely popular with students since their return to campus.
“When I go past the Intercultural Center, the papers are gone by noon, so students are obviously reading the papers,” GUSA Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) said.
He added that GUSA is still credited for any unused papers on days when papers are not picked up because of bad weather or other reasons.
Many students enjoy the tangible aspect of newspaper that digital subscriptions cannot provide.
“It allows you to go through systematically and choose what you want to browse,” said Christian Chung (SFS ’13), who grabs a a paper almost every day. “Sometimes people don’t always have the ability to carry their laptops everywhere.”
Laverriere recognized that students’ methods of accessing news are changing, but he feels that the popularity of the service speaks for its sustainability.
“It’s obviously not a great time in the world for print media,” he said. “But as long as students demonstrate that its something they’re interested in, GUSA will continue to invest the money.”

In the coming weeks, students interested in bettering the club funding system will be hopping from campus to campus to analyze their peers.
By sending students to eight universities nationwide, the Georgetown University Student Association’s Student Life Report Committee hopes to gather information on various advisory board frameworks before it releases its recommendations for reform of Georgetown’s student funding boards.
“Our idea was to have students actually go to the front lines of these universities,” said Ronak Parikh (MSB ’12), vice chairman of the Student Life Report Committee.
Student representatives plan to meet with students and administrators at the eight schools to discuss different methods of governing student organizations. Shuo Yan Tan (SFS ’12), chairman of the committee, said the group chose schools that they thought offered unique solutions to challenges faced by university advisory boards.
“Through these comparative trips, we hope to gain insights into alternative modes and structures for student programming, governance and autonomy, and thereafter provide recommendations to reform the advisory boards at Georgetown,” Tan said.
A tentative list of schools includes: University of Wisconsin; University of Pennsylvania; University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; Cornell University; Duke University; Boston College; American University and The George Washington University.
The first report on student life, which was released in 1999, focused on several aspects of campus life, including bureaucracy, funding and space. Some of the report’s recommendations continue to play out in present-day discussions, including the effort to create more student space around campus.
This is the first time that comparative trips will be included in the study.
“We tend to work in a certain mindset,” Parikh said, adding that he hoped the trip would allow committee members to break free from any preconceived notions.
Parikh said the committee has already received applications from several students interested in participating in the trips. While many of the applicants are members of the GUSA executive branch, leaders of campus organizations and other interested students have also applied.
“We don’t want to make it a GUSA project,” Parikh said. “We want to make it a report that caters to all groups on campus.”
The committee hopes to have two to three students take part in each trip. The overall cost, which will vary largely with the price of plane tickets, is estimated to be several thousand dollars. Parikh said that the trips have been funded by GUSA and by donations from alumni.
Students who participate in the trips will be responsible for writing a report that will be submitted to the committee. Trips are expected to take place by mid-October, and the committee will release their report by the end of the fall semester.
