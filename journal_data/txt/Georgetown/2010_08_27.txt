Two issues top Georgetown University Student Association’s to-do list as it prepares to return for the fall: weekend Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle services and club finance reform.
GUSA Vice President Jason Kluger (MSB ’11) said the senate has created a plan to reinstate weekend GUTS bus service.
This spring, an investigation of funding for weekend GUTS bus services showed that the program would quickly run out of money. GUTS buses are not paid for directly by the university, but by GUSA and the Alumni Fund. In the final GUSA Senate meeting of the 2009-2010 academic year on May 2, $5,000 was approved to pay for the program in the short term.
But the long-term question of who will pay for the program has yet to be resolved. “[GUSA President] Calen [Angert (MSB ’11)] and I feel . that the ultimate responsibility of funding this program does not rely on the students given how weekend GUTS buses serve many members of the university in addition to the students,” Kluger said, pointing to the fact that the administration currently pays for the GUTS bus on weekdays.
“We look forward to working with administrators on this issue with the goal of establishing a sustainable program that does not put the financial burden on the student body for a service that the entire university community enjoys,” he added.
On the issue of club reform, Kluger said he felt more comfortable declaring victory as the keynote of his administration’s previous year. “The club funding reform process proved successful during last year’s annual allocation at the end of the year,” Kluger said.
Club funding reform proved to be a contentious issue on campus in the spring as well, since the decisions made had ramifications for the way student groups received money to fund events and programs.
The Student Activities Commission appropriates money from GUSA to allocate to clubs within its jurisdiction, which covers most extracurricular activities on campus. In order to receive funding for the 2010-2011 academic year, SAC had to approve several reform measures approved by GUSA, such as publicizing budgetary votes within SAC. The final budget for SAC, after acquiescing to GUSA’s demands, was approved May 2.
One of the issues raised within the reform discussion was that a significant amount of budgetary responsibilities fall on GUSA, which, outside of the Executive Administration, undergoes a high rate of turnover each year.
“The club funding reform process proved successful during last year’s annual allocation at the end of the year,” Kluger said in an e-mail. “We look forward to analyzing that process further, improving on it in collaboration with the GUSA Senate, and establishing an institutional knowledge within GUSA, particularly during the transition period of the summer and September, during which members of the Fin/App Committee will continue to educate younger Hoyas on the process of funding and its overall importance to the student body as the mechanism of ensuring complete financial transparency and accountability.”
He also noted that the Summer Fellowship, a GUSA program that pays for a limited number of students to receive free housing while interning in Washington, D.C., had a successful summer.
“We were thrilled with the successful expansion of the mentorship side of the program,” he said.
Looking ahead, Angert has hinted that the senate will have a productive semester.
“We’ll have both major and minor initiatives coming through the pipeline,” Angert said. “In a macro sense, we’re best prepared to tackle our new agenda now that some lingering issues, such as student funding, have resolved themselves.”
He added that GUSA’s executive has expanded to better accommodate underclassmen interested in getting involved.

Former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe Vélez was appointed to the faculty of the School of Foreign Service in August, according to a university press release.
Uribe was named a Distinguished Scholar in the Practice of Global Leadership and will lead programs for SFS students and faculty addressing issues in the international community, the press release said.
“President Uribe will bring a truly unique perspective to discussions of global affairs at Georgetown,” said Carol Lancaster, dean of the School of Foreign Service. “We are thrilled that he has identified Georgetown as a place where he will share his knowledge and interface with Washington.”
Uribe stepped down as president of Colombia this month, leaving office with a 75 percent approval rating. His administration was noted for increasing investment and defeating leftist guerillas in Colombia.
Guerillas targeted Uribe with a rocket and mortar attack on his inauguration day in 2002. Uribe was succeeded as president by Juan Manuel Santos on Aug. 7.
“It is a great honor to participate in this prestigious Georgetown University program, sharing my experience with younger generations,” Uribe said in the press release.
University spokesman Rob Mathis declined to comment.

Burleith: the neighborhood north of campus distinguished by its tree-lined streets, rowhouses and, as of this summer, dozens of small yard signs displaying the slogan “Our Homes, Not GU’s Dorm.”
As Georgetown officials seek zoning approval for the university’s 2010 Campus Plan, many residents of the surrounding neighborhoods have made clear their disapproval.
Five neighborhood organizations, including the Burleith Citizens’ Association and the Citizens Association of Georgetown, stated their opposition in a joint letter published Aug. 11 in The Georgetowner.
“Unfortunately, being the university’s neighbor . has major disadvantages, such as group-house noise, alcohol-fueled student misbehavior, traffic and parking congestion, trash and blighted, unsafe housing stock,” they wrote. “We stand together in opposing the GU plan.”
Although little has changed since Georgetown officials announced several concessions to community opposition at a public meeting in April, many residents are gearing up for a fight.
In addition to the yard signs springing up in Burleith, community organizations are writing letters, circulating petitions and raising money, hoping to pressure city officials and prepare a case against the plan.
The administration expects to officially file its plan with the District of Columbia Board of Zoning Adjustment this fall, although it maintains that the details are still being refined.
“We continue to seek input from the community about provisions in our plan,” university spokesperson Julie Bataille said. “We take community issues seriously.”
The campus plan, which the university must develop for city approval every 10 years, calls for a loop road to connect the north and south sides of campus, a 120-bed dormitory for graduate students in the center of the block that holds the restaurant 1789, an addition to Lauinger Library, and the renovation of the first floor of New South Hall to create new student space, among other projects.
The most controversial element is a proposal to add nearly 2,500 new graduate students by 2020. Although the plan foresees no increase in undergraduate enrollment, many residents already feel overrun by unruly students and think that the changes will only exacerbate an intolerable situation created by the university’s lack of on-campus housing.
Residents maintain that the need to live off campus hurts students themselves.
“We are concerned not only about the impact on the neighborhoods but the safety of students, who are forced to reside in group houses that are not safe. Walking along Prospect Street underscores the need for more and better on-campus housing,” said Jennifer Althemus, president of the Georgetown Citizens Association. CAG, one of multiple resident coalitions, has over a thousand members.
The opinions of students about the residents’ concerns and their own behavior tend to be mixed.
“There were a few loud houses on my block, but it’s pretty easy to tell the difference between the backyard of a student and the backyard of a permanent resident, and it seems like there are more permanent residents than students,” said Bill Nelson (COL ’11), who rented a house in Burleith with friends this summer.
He added that he had no serious trouble with neighbors.
The incoming class of freshmen seems to echo most students in their general disagreement with the residents’ complaints.
“I appreciate their concerns,” said Nathaniel Tisa (SFS ’14), who hopes to live off campus during his senior year, “but the residents need to understand that the university culture is part of the neighborhood. … Denying GU students the opportunity to live off campus because of their age-associated behavior is unfair, discriminatory and short-sighted. Not all college students are raucous and disruptive.”

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority introduced a series of fare adjustments over the summer in order to raise $108.7 million in budget funding for the 2011 fiscal year.
Starting June 27, the regular base boarding fare for Metrorail increased about 18 percent from $1.65 to $1.95. The Metrobus fare increased to $1.50 for SmarTrip card users, and to $1.70 for riders paying with cash. The prices of Metrorail passes increased by 15 percent, and the price of the weekly Metrobus pass increased from $11 to $15, but frequent riders will continue to save money by buying the passes instead of the individual fare cards.
etrorail and Metrobus fares for the elderly and disabled increased by 50 percent.
WMATA took a number of other steps to raise money and cut costs. The 5A bus running from the Rosslyn Metro station to Washington Dulles International Airport and the B30 bus running from Greenbelt Metro Station to Baltimore-Washington International Airport now cost riders $6, compared to the previous fare of $3.10. The annual fee for WMATA patrons to rent bicycle lockers at Metrorail stations increased from $70 to $200, marking the first price increase in the rental fees since the program began in 1978.
The rail-to-bus and bus-to-bus transfer periods were both lowered from three to two hours. If riders pay their bus fares with SmarTrip cards, they may make unlimited Metrobus transfers within a two-hour period. Patrons who pay their Metrorail fares with SmarTrips pay reduced fares if they need to make a transfer to a Metrobus within a two-hour period.
The second phase of fare adjustments for Metrorail began on Aug. 3, though it was originally scheduled to take effect Aug. 1. The date was pushed back in order to provide WMATA workers adequate time to post updated fare charts.
SmarTrip card users continue to pay the old fare, but the fare for riders purchasing paper fare cards increased by 25 cents. In addition, patrons riding on weekdays from 7:30 to 9 a.m. and from 4:30 to 6 p.m. began paying a 20-cent surcharge.
WMATA also introduced three new Metrorail passes, including a weekly short trip pass ($32.35), a weekly fast pass ($47), and a transit link card for Maryland Area Regional Commuter train and Virginia Railway Express ($102).
While Metrorail and Metrobus patrons may take issue with the fare increases, a press release from WMATA noted that public opinion was taken into consideration when the board of directors moved forward with the fare adjustments. “[An] overwhelming majority of riders said that they preferred fare increases instead of service reductions,” according to the press release.

Georgetown rose from 23rd to 21st in the 2011 version of the annual U.S. News & World Report national universities rankings, driven up the list by high marks in the high school counselor rankings and other specialty areas.
The change ended Georgetown’s five-year stay in the 23rd position.
“Georgetown is pleased that we maintained strong rankings for our undergraduate programs and especially appreciate the input of high school counselors in this effort,” University President John J. DeGioia said in a university press release.
Georgetown ranked sixth in the high school counselor category. This year was the first year the publication included a survey of high school counselors, which was given a 7.5 percent weight in the overall ranking.
“We place more value on this new ranking because the people who are surveyed are actually in the marketplace,” University Dean of Admissions Charles Deacon said. “We believe that this is a much truer indication of how Georgetown ranks.”
Originally, the publication only used an academic peer assessment, which included opinions by university presidents.
“We have added the opinions of high school counselors since we believe they have considerable knowledge about the college admissions process and that they have highly informed views on many colleges in their region and nationwide,” a post on the U.S. News & World Report website said.
According to Deacon, the university did well in this category because it has long-term relationships with many of the counselors surveyed as Georgetown representatives visit schools in all 50 states each year. The raise is expected to have a positive impact on admissions yield because many applicants refer to rankings to ultimately make college decisions.
“This will impact people who are not as well informed about colleges,” Deacon said.
The university improved in many of the magazine’s specialty rankings, as well. The undergraduate program at the McDonough School of Business moved from 21st to 19th this year.
“We owe our continued success to our devoted faculty, our talented students and the creative energy generated by the space in our new building,” said Norean Sharpe, undergraduate dean of the business school. “In addition, our [undergraduate] program staff have been working hard to implement and support new initiatives and programs, such as our First Year Seminar, the Professional Development Series and the Compass Fellows Program,” Sharpe said.
U.S. News & World report also included Georgetown on its list of the 25 most economically diverse universities, which is tied to the number of students who receive Pell Grants.
Representatives from the Office of Student Financial Services declined to comment for this report.
The issue of U.S. News & World Report including the list will be available starting Aug. 31.

Hoyas who can’t get enough of `Jersey Shore”s Snooki and The Situation may be happy to learn that soon, they will have a new reality show to watch – one featuring their fellow Georgetown students. GUTV’s new show documents the experiences of an incoming group of freshmen. The show will air in the spring.
Joe Mancino (COL ’13) and Alison Doyle (SFS ’13) entered the early planning stages of creating the show in mid-July. The two contacted GUTV to ensure that they would be able to use the station’s resources and equipment. Cast selection began shortly thereafter.
ancino said he tried to put together a show last semester on GUTV called “The Joe Show” but found it difficult to write the script, assemble a cast and create a product that a broad audience would find entertaining. Doyle contacted Mancino about the idea of documenting the freshman class’s first year at Georgetown, and from there they got the necessary support from GUTV to make it reality.
ancino said that the casting call was featured on various Facebook groups that had been set up by freshmen. Potential cast members were asked to fill out a questionnaire. The questions on the application covered topics including applicants’ hometowns, relationships and self-perception.
After Mancino and Doyle read the answers submitted by the 15 applicants, they selected a group that they then interviewed by video online.
“From that we will probably choose four for the primary cast members on the show,” Mancino said.
The creators wanted to ensure that the cast painted a picture of the Class of 2014 that was diverse and complete – socioeconomically, ethnically and culturally.
“Georgetown is an extremely diverse campus, and when I say diverse I am not referring to race,” Mancino wrote in an e-mail. “I feel like our school represents many extremes. . We set out to try and find a cast that would represent all types of Georgetown experiences.”
Doyle and Mancino said they hope to employ the talents of other students on campus by featuring music from Georgetown-based singers and musicians for the theme song, as well as music throughout the series.
The show will air on the GUTV station, channel 60 on RCN and on the GUTV Web site main.gutvonline.org.

Students planning to stay at Villa Le Balze, Georgetown’s villa in Fiesole, Italy, received disappointing news this July: The Villa was struggling with roofing problems, and the repair process meant students would be unable to stay there during their term abroad.
The university sent an e-mail to students explaining that the Villa’s age most likely caused the roofing problems, which will be fixed this fall.
argaret Rockefeller donated the Villa to Georgetown in 1979 in order to preserve her father’s memory and the education of young minds. Her parents were Charles Augustus Strong and Elizabeth Rockefeller, and her grandfather was John D. Rockefeller. Strong hired architects to build the Villa in 1912, and he lived there until he died in 1940.
Katherine Kettle (COL ’12), a HOYA staff writer, one of the students who had planned to stay at the Villa this fall, did not believe the news at first.
“It was really shocking and unexpected. I remember reading it and thinking it was a joke or something,” Kettle said.
“Initially I was very shocked, but [I] decided right away that I still wanted to go.”
In the e-mail, the university introduced the alternative accommodations it had arranged for the students. Hotel Villa Aurora will host the students for the first part of the semester, from Sept. 2 to Oct. 6, and Hotel Villa Fiesole will serve as their home for the remainder of the semester, which ends Dec. 16. Students who had planned to stay with host families in and around Florence will still be able to access both venues easily, given that both are located on the same bus line.
The e-mail, sent from Lisa Donatelli, deputy director of international programs, and Karen Wardzala, assistant director of Villa Le Balze Programs, also assured students that while the location would be different, their overall study-abroad experience would not be greatly impacted because of the similarities the Villa shares with the two new accommodations.
“We have selected these venues based on their willingness and ability to help us recreate certain aspects typical of the Villa Le Balze semester: modern instructional spaces; shared meals with Villa professors and staff; student gathering areas including spaces for home stay students to gather and store their belongings; professional staff who understand the scope of the program and the nature of Georgetown students; and Wi-Fi Internet access to facilitate communication and research,” they wrote.
Kettle, among the students who still plan to study in Florence this fall despite the change in venue, said she feels that the new arrangements are more than adequate alternatives.
“I did not consider going on another study abroad because I was never going to the Villa for the building in the first place – I chose the program because I wanted to live in Italy and experience Florence and Fiesole,” Kettle said. “I think that people who were going just to stay at the physical building of the Villa in the first place were not going for the right reasons because I do not think that [that] is the point of study abroad.”

D.C. Council Chairman Vincent Gray has taken a five-point lead over incumbent Mayor Adrian Fenty in the race for the Democratic mayoral nomination, according to a new poll from Clarus Research Group.
The primary is set to be held Sept. 14. Since all mayors of the District of Columbia have been Democrats since the institution of election by popular vote in 1975, the primary is seen as critical in the race for the office.
The poll puts Gray’s lead at three points overall, 39 to 36 percent, but the lead rises to a 41 to 36 percent margin among voters who said they were very likely to vote. Gray’s lead among African-Americans is 38 points, while Fenty leads by 42 points among whites. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 40.6 percent of D.C. residents are white, while 54 percent are black.
While Fenty has faced criticism for his policies and budget cuts, his job approval rating has risen from 41 to 49 percent over the past nine months, according to Clarus. His personal favorability rating is at 46 percent, compared to Gray’s 55 percent.
According to Ron Faucheux, president of the Clarus Research Group and a professor at Georgetown’s Public Policy Institute, turnout may determine the outcome of the primary. According to a recent ruling, D.C. will maintain its closed primary system, meaning that voters must be affiliated with the Democratic party to vote in the primary and must have declared this affiliation 30 days before voting. According to The Washington Post, Fenty’s campaign was hoping to swing undecided, unaffiliated voters in the coming weeks and lobbied to have them be able to register on the day of the primary directly before voting.
Clarus Research Group is a nonpartisan polling firm based in D.C. It polled 501 Democratic voters in D.C. via telephone on Aug. 15 and 16. There is a +/- 4.4 margin of error.

As students return to campus this fall and some of them inevitably become injured or ill, Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service will be filling out the paperwork a little differently this year – without the paper.
GERMS transferred their patient care reports from paper forms to an electronic system this summer. According to the GERMS blog, GERMS has answered 100 calls and saved about $99 in paper and printing costs as of Aug. 21.
The system was first tested in May. GERMS president Colin Brody (COL ’11) said that the summer interim proved beneficial for working out the kinks.
Part of the reason for the switch was the upcoming change in emergency medical service requirements. Beginning in January 2011, the D.C. Department of Health will require that all EMS have electronic patient care reports for the purpose of ensuring a high quality of care, as well as for compiling statistics.
“We wanted to make sure we were good and ready to export [data] as soon as they said, `Hit the switch,'” Brody said.
With the new system, GERMS will be better able to identify the types of patients they typically receive while being able to easily export information to assist in national research and reports on EMS response times.
GERMS Captain Brendan Maggiore (MSB ’11), who oversees all patient records, said that the system provides for more immediate feedback on the crew’s documentation practices.
Regarding tangible differences when GERMS arrives on the scene, Maggiore said there are a few new steps. Patients will notice GERMS using laptops on-scene and type details rather than write them down by hand. Waivers will now be signed on a computer screen rather than on paper.
One constant, however, is the continued confidentiality for patients. No one can access someone’s patient records at will. The policy continues as it was before.
The idea for the change originated from a few past board members after they saw the electronic PCRs used by The George Washington University’s student EMS when the Georgetown and GWU crews rode together in ambulances for President Obama’s inauguration.
For the students, however, it’s all about the end result.
“I appreciate the services that GERMS provides for the Georgetown community, and I am impressed by the fact that they continue to seek out improvements,” Kelsey Tom (MSB ’11) said.
