Kuran Malhotra (MSB ’20), amid allegations that he fostered a toxic work environment and engaged in instances of inappropriate touching in social settings, was placed on an indefinite leave of absence from top leadership positions in two prominent student finance groups last week. 
Malhotra was suspended from his position as CEO of the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union on Oct. 3, according to a same-day email to GUASFCU interns obtained by The Hoya. Malhotra was also placed on leave from his position as chief financial officer of the Hilltop Microfinance Initiative on Oct. 4, according to a message sent to HMFI staff obtained by The Hoya. 
Three former HMFI staffers and a current high-ranking GUASFCU leader, who all requested anonymity, described Malhotra’s domineering leadership style and outsized detrimental influence on the organizations’ cultures. Sources described a pattern of inappropriate touching and groping in social situations — characterized by a physical encroachment into personal space that surpassed friendly contact — coupled with inadequate redress of the behavior when concerns were raised to other group leaders. 
Malhotra has not responded to requests for comment on specific allegations at the time of publication. 
The Hoya does not have evidence of a Title IX complaint regarding Malhotra’s behavior. 
Crossing Lines
Malhotra has received two reprimands from GUASFCU leadership regarding inappropriate touching, according to the GUASFCU leader, the first during his freshman year and the second during his junior spring, just before he was confirmed as CEO of GUASFCU.
The previous year’s GUASFCU board is responsible for the selection of the new board every year. The 2018-19 board of directors, on which Malhotra served as chief technology officer, was made aware of allegations against Malhotra but still selected him as CEO, the GUASFCU leader said in an interview with The Hoya. 
“The old board votes on who the new CEO is, and he had enablers on that board who looked past those incidents,” the GUASFCU leader said. 
Another student familiar with the situation confirmed to The Hoya that accusations about Malhotra’s behavior, including inappropriate touching, began during Malhotra’s freshman year at the university.
GUASFCU is conducting an internal investigation into the allegations against Malhotra, according to an email to The Hoya from GUASFCU leadership.
“GUASFCU has been informed of allegations against a member of the Hilltop Microfinance Initiative who was also the GUASFCU Chief Executive Officer,” according to an Oct. 6 statement from the GUASFCU board of directors. “Given our concern for the interest and welfare of our interns and members, we have made changes to our board of directors and have begun an investigation related to GUASFCU.”
HMFI is also conducting its own investigation into the allegations, according to HMFI leadership.
“The Hilltop Microfinance Initiative was made aware of allegations regarding the professional conduct of our Chief Financial Officer, Kuran Malhotra, late last week,” HMFI wrote in an Oct. 9 statement to The Hoya. “As an organization entirely led by and comprised of Georgetown undergraduates, we take these allegations extremely seriously. The safety and comfort of our members remains our priority while reviewing the allegations brought forward.”
Neither GUASFCU nor HMFI leadership responded to requests for comment on specific allegations against Malhotra. 
All GUASFCU staff members are required to sign the organization’s Professionalism and Sexual Assault Policy agreeing to comply with the organization’s standards for conduct, according to a copy of the policy obtained by The Hoya. The policy applies to all actions between interns — the title given to all GUASFCU staff members — and non-GUASFCU members of the Georgetown community, as well as interactions between GUASFCU interns and members of the credit union both within the GUASFCU workplace and outside it. Staffers are required to sign the policy every 12 months, according to a student close to the situation.
HMFI members are not currently required to sign a policy regarding sexual misconduct, according to a former staffer. 
Before he held a position of leadership, Malhotra was approached informally by members of HMFI leadership on more than one occasion with concerns about his excessive drinking and inappropriate behavior that made staffers feel uncomfortable, according to another former HMFI staffer.
A separate former HMFI staffer detailed an experience at a party, when both had been drinking, at which Malhotra made the staffer uncomfortable with touchiness in their interactions. 
“I remember feeling like this is weird, like this should not be happening,” the former staffer said.
After informally raising the interaction to a member of HMFI leadership, the former staffer felt blamed for the encounter and underscored the power dynamics at play in this incident and other similar ones. 
The staffer later resigned from HMFI, motivated in part by Malhotra’s behavior and by a desire to gain distance from a culture that fostered manipulation and discomfort for its members.
“You allow this to happen constantly, and I don’t want to be responsible,” the former HMFI staffer said. “If something happens to a girl or a guy, I don’t want to be the one who’s complicit in this.”
Leadership, Power and Manipulation
Malhotra first became CFO of HMFI for a yearlong term in spring 2018 and was reappointed in spring 2019; he was chosen as CEO of GUASFCU in spring 2019. In over a year and a half with HMFI, he became a driving force of a culture of distrust and manipulation, according to the three former HMFI staffers. 
One of the former HMFI staffers told The Hoya that the club’s workplace environment was the most toxic they had ever witnessed because of Malhotra’s leadership. Malhotra micromanaged staffers outside of his responsibilities, seeking opportunities to increase his personal power regardless of the impact of this pursuit on other members of the organization, according to the staffer. Malhotra monopolized discussions and belittled and insulted the work of other staffers, the staffer said.
“Kuran is someone who likes power, and monopolizes it and abuses it,” the former staffer said, citing Malhotra as a primary reason why they resigned from the organization. 
The two other former HMFI staffers also cited Malhotra as a key factor in their departures from the organization. Malhotra is known to make staffers uncomfortable, both through verbal manipulation and rudeness in professional settings and inappropriate touching in social settings like HMFI parties. This behavior caused the departure of several staff members, according to the two former HMFI staffers. 
“It just makes me feel like there’s this power dynamic going on that’s palpable. People know; we don’t say anything,” one of the former staffers said. “That’s part of the reason why I quit.” 
Within GUASFCU, Malhotra created a culture of fear by using bullying tactics, like privately berating those who confronted or displeased him, according to the GUASFCU leader. Malhotra would occasionally arrange one-on-one meetings with staffers outside of the office, during which he would criticize them at length. 
“He’s just attacking, and he will invoke whether you’re even capable of doing the job or whether you have the intellectual rigor to work in this thing,” the GUASFCU leader said. “He’s a bully, and that’s part of the reason that it was so hard to get him out.”
Dismissal of Repeated Concerns
In addition to concerns about inappropriate touching, several HMFI staffers resigned because of Malhotra’s rude or manipulative behavior toward them or their awareness that Malhotra had acted inappropriately with others and leadership declined to take action, two HMFI staffers said. 
One former HMFI staffer recalled formally expressing concerns about Malhotra’s behavior to leadership but felt the feedback was not followed up on.
“I know that that’s not the first time that someone has complained about him to leadership, and they kind of said, ‘Ok, we’ll handle it,’ and then not done anything,” the former HMFI staffer said.
Some of the former staff members who also quit because of Malhotra voiced their concerns to leadership but did not feel that HMFI’s response was sufficient.
“I have other people I know who’ve quit, under the condition that they’d love to stay and help HMFI as long as Kuran was gone, and they were told that would never happen,” one of the former HMFI staffers said. “They were unwilling to take action, not even to remove him, but just to broach this topic with him that he’s had a lot of complaints.”
HMFI leadership said it did formally share feedback with Malhotra last semester.
“In Spring 2019, we had provided Kuran with written feedback and two members of the leadership team had conversations with him over the phone and in person,” HMFI leadership wrote in an Oct. 10 email to The Hoya. “Because we take honest feedback seriously, the process is both anonymous and confidential.”
Malhotra’s financial experience and expertise were enough for HMFI leadership to justify maintaining his role as CFO, according to one of the former staffers.  
“I have been told that nothing will be done,” one of the former HMFI staffers said. “That Kuran is such an important asset because he has so much knowledge.”
Malhotra’s competence and dedication to his work played a similar role in the 2018-19 GUASFCU board of directors’ decision to promote him to CEO, according to the GUASFCU leader. 
“He spent countless hours there; he was a huge force behind the development of the credit union in driving revenues and cutting expenses,” the GUASFCU leader said. “He did a lot for the business.”
The decision to prioritize Malhotra’s anticipated effectiveness as CEO over concerns about his inappropriate professional and social behavior partially results from the preprofessional culture of GUASFCU and from Malhotra’s intimidation of those who opposed him, according to the GUASFCU leader. 
“They’re certainly not going to cause a ruckus and potentially jeopardize moving up because Kuran was known to be very vindictive in terms of allowing people to move up,” the GUASFCU leader said. 
The failure of HMFI’s leadership to take action on Malhotra’s harmful behavior and broader concerns about the club’s culture created a toxic atmosphere, one former HMFI staffer said. 
“I think the point is that it’s a hostile work environment, and I don’t feel safe mentally or in a physical setting with these people,” the former HMFI staffer said. “And I think that’s the point — it’s supposed to be fun. It’s a freaking club.”

Let’s be clear — even though the article mentions “sexual assault” and “sexual misconduct”, no person has accused him of such transgressions.
I wonder what are the limits of the Hoya’s libel insurance policy.  
What does “toxic” mean?

This is the silliest thing I’ve ever read. Beyond the fact that the Hoya fabricated this story and my friends and I were asked to lie to get him removed, there’s clearcut evidence of racism in GUASFCU and people always talk about how they hate having indian ceos. the fact that this is still up is horrible, and the hoya is perpetuating horrible racism and making it harder for survivors to tell their stories when they post fake news like this

The Georgetown University athletic department disinvited rapper Fabolous from Friday’s Hoya Madness pep rally Oct. 8 after facing pressure from student activists who raised concerns about the rapper’s past charges of domestic violence. 
The university announced Sunday that Grammy Award-nominated John David Jackson, known by his stage name Fabolous, would perform alongside this year’s Hoya Madness host, radio personality Big Tigger, as well as student dance groups, cheerleaders and the Georgetown University Pep Band. Jackson is best known for his song “Into You,” featuring Tamia. 
The announcement was quickly met with pushback by students when charges of domestic violence against Jackson came to light. Jackson was indicted on four felony charges in October 2018, according to a USA Today affiliate. The charges included one count of domestic violence with significant bodily injury, two counts of threatening to kill and one count of possession of a weapon.
H*yas For Choice, a student-run reproductive rights advocacy group, pushed for Fabolous’s disinvitation in a blog post written by Ollie Hanner (NHS ’22), a member of the group’s advocacy team. 
Georgetown’s choice to invite Jackson to perform despite his criminal history did not align with the school’s Jesuit values, according to Hanner’s post published Tuesday afternoon before Fabolous’s event was canceled later that day. 
“He doesn’t seem to be a glowing beacon of the cura personalis preached to us since freshman orientation,” Hanner wrote in the blog post.
Despite its blog post, HFC does not feel it directly influenced the disinvitation, HFC President Talia Parker (COL ’20) wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Several members of Pep Band also shared a petition addressed to university Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Lee Reed advocating for Jackson’s disinvitation.
The petition, obtained by The Hoya, was addressed to Reed and signed by 13 students, most of whom were members of Pep Band. Students encouraged the university to reconsider Jackson as the musical act because of the rapper’s criminal history, according to the petition.
“We strongly urge Georgetown to reconsider the message it sends students in booking an act who has a history of domestic violence,” the petition said. “Georgetown Athletics, cancel Fabolous’ performance to condemn his past behavior and maintain the Hoya family as a welcoming and safe space for all.”
The Georgetown athletic department formally disinvited Jackson on Oct. 8 after conversations with students, according to a statement Reed released on the Georgetown athletics website Tuesday night.
“After engaging with students, we have cancelled the musical act for 2019 Hoya Madness,” Reed wrote. “We take domestic violence very seriously and were unaware of the charges against the entertainer when he was booked through a third party entity.” 
Though Pep Band was planning to participate in the Hoya Madness program regardless of the musical performer, the group approves of the decision to remove Jackson from the program, according to Pep Band President Elise Dumont (COL ’20). 
“The Georgetown Pep Band fully supports Athletics’ decision to disinvite Fabolous, and is looking forward to supporting our wonderful student-athletes at Hoya Madness in anticipation of the 2019-20 basketball season,” Dumont wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The charges against Jackson stem from a March 2018 incident in which Jackson assaulted his partner and the mother of his two children, Emily Bustamante, in the face seven times, according to a USA Today affiliate. Bustamante lost two front teeth because of this incident. 
In separate incidents that month, Jackson was also recorded waving scissors and cursing in a March 2018 TMZ video and has also threatened Bustamante’s father and brother. 
In March, Jackson reached a plea deal with prosecutors who agreed to drop charges if Jackson completed a pretrial intervention program and maintained good behavior, according to TMZ. Jackson was not required to participate in therapy or anger management courses as a part of the plea deal, Brian Neary, the rapper’s attorney, said to TMZ in March.

Protests by law students and professors prevented acting United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan from delivering an address at the Georgetown University Law Center on Monday.
Law Center students were joined in protest by a coalition of groups including CREDO Action, a progressive organizing group, and Sanctuary DMV, a volunteer group that advocates for immigrants and marginalized communities in the area, according to CREDO Action’s Twitter. 
McAleenan was scheduled as the keynote speaker at the 16th Annual Immigration Law and Policy Conference, an annual conference that invites public officials, advocates, journalists and notable experts to discuss immigration politics. Under the President Donald Trump administration, the Department of Homeland Security has pushed policy changes to grapple with an increased number of migrants, including restrictions on asylum, forcible waits in Mexico and family separation policies, according to The New York Times.
As McAleenan was introduced on stage, protesters began chanting, “When immigrants are under attack, what do we do? Stand up! Fight back!” while unfurling two large signs that said, “Hate is not normal” and “Stand with immigrants.”
Event moderators asked the protesters to leave, saying the rest of the audience wanted to hear what McAleenan had to say. But, after multiple unsuccessful attempts to speak, McAleenan thanked the hosts and left the stage.
Under McAleenan’s oversight, DHS has carried out policies that have exacerbated an antiimmigrant environment, according to student protest organizer Sabiya Ahamed (LAW ’20).
“He is the head of the Department of Homeland Security. Anything that happens under his watch, he is responsible for,” Ahamed said. “And all the things we have seen in the news, about immigrants and the way migrants are treated in this country, are his responsibility, and they’re his fault. There’s no space for the law school, for us, to be honoring his policies or him.”
The DHS, which oversees the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, became a flashpoint of controversy in June 2018 as the Abolish ICE movement gained traction. The movement stemmed from the Trump administration’s controversial family separation policy, which allows federal authorities to separate children from parents or guardians after illegally entering the United States, according to CNN. 
Before the event, a group of Law Center protesters chanted slogans such as “abolish ICE” and “Hey hey, ho ho, DHS has got to go. Hey hey, ho ho, McAleenan has got to go” toward attendees entering the auditorium.
Jeremy Penn (LAW ’21), who participated in the protest inside the auditorium, said her group began chanting the names of children and adults who have died in ICE custody to draw attention to the narratives of those individuals.
“We are bringing them into this space, because they are the center of this story,” Penn said. “It is the people who are no longer with us who are why we are doing this.”
By giving McAleenan the privilege of a keynote address, the university was elevating the message of his speech and setting the tone for the event more broadly, according to Ahamed.
“It’s a form of honor and respect; it’s not just a platform — it’s also a pedestal,” Ahamed said. “We are elevating his voice as the opener of the conference, and it’s going to frame the conference.”
The conference was at full capacity from online preregistrations for the keynote, according to the online page advertising the event. McAleenan was expected to answer questions from the audience after his remarks.
The activists’ demonstration prevented the audience from engaging in a productive dialogue with McAleenan, according to a DHS news release.
“The First Amendment guarantees all Americans the right to free speech and assembly,” the news release read. “Unfortunately that right was robbed from many who were scheduled to speak and attend today’s event at Georgetown.”
Law Center Dean William Treanor also expressed disappointment at the protester’s interruptions in an Oct. 7 email to all Law Center students.
“We share our partners’ regret that the audience did not get to hear from the Secretary and engage in a dialogue through the Q&A session that was scheduled to occur following his remarks,” Treanor wrote. “Georgetown Law is committed to free speech and expression and the ability of speakers to be heard and engage in dialogue.”
Law Center students launched a letter campaign Sept. 30 asking the Law Center to rescind McAleenan’s invitation to the conference. The petition garnered over 300 signatures from students, faculty, staff and outside organizations and was delivered to Treanor on Oct. 3. 
Law Center professor Heidi Li Feldman said she joined the protests because she believed inviting McAleenan to the Law Center normalized his harmful policies.  
“It’s a mistake to legitimize people who have violated law… international law, by respectfully sitting there and listening to them as if they are just usual government officials,” Li Feldman said in an interview with The Hoya.
Standing alongside peers affected by DHS policies motivated students to participate in the demonstrations, according to student protest organizer Ashley Burke (LAW ’22).
“We felt the need to organize this protest because there are people within Georgetown Law, and from the undergrad campus as well, who have been personally affected by the policies of DHS, and we didn’t want to let it go unmarked,” Burke said. “We felt the need to make this a safer space for people on campus who are personally affected, to know that we are not okay with this.”

If Dean Treanor were serious about “dialogue” and Georgetown’s reputation as a serious place, he would immediately suspend the student protestors and send a strong signal that Georgetown is not Middlebury.

GTAlum says 
October 11, 2019 at 1:48 pm
It is a sad day when a “University” which by definition is supposed to welcome and support differing viewpoints cannot facilitate discussion and understanding because of protests.  The People who protest display a fundamental ignorance and intolerance that represents the University poorly.  If you want to create change you have to do so via dialog and understanding, not through shouting and bully tactics.  This type of conduct is just an embarassment.

Robert Johnson says 
October 11, 2019 at 8:43 pm
These students ought to have their conduct reported to any bar they attempt to join. Their unwillingness to maintain decorum in the face of arguments and people they disagree with is significant evidence that they do not have the character and fitness required of an attorney.

ML, L'95 says 
October 13, 2019 at 11:53 am
Smart people should be able to utilize the question and answer format to challenge a speaker in a direct and clear way. Shouting down an opponent is unproductive and prevents others from becoming informed on issues. It is chaotic behavior that is unacceptable at a University and at an event that offered the audience a way to participate in dialogue. I don’t think it is ever a “mistake” to be respectful. Respecting someone does not mean agreeing with them or supporting them. Mutual respect is vital for dialogue and peaceful progress. Mutual respect requires maturity and self control and I know the Georgetown students and faculty are up to the challenge. Let’s do better going forward.

In honor of its third year of operation at Georgetown University, the Maker Hub will hold an event Oct. 19 which will showcase student projects created in the space. 
The Maker Hub, the university’s on-campus lab to explore technology through creative projects, has hosted an anniversary event every year since its opening, attracting a growing number of visitors every year, according to Don Undeen, the manager of the Maker Hub. Any student who has created something in the Maker Hub and wants to exhibit their work can be featured in the celebration, and the event itself will be open to all members of the Georgetown community.
 The Maker Hub, located on the first floor of Lauinger Library, was opened Oct. 19, 2016, and spearheaded by Beth Marhanka, the current head of the Gelardin New Media Center and founder of the Maker Hub. 
The Maker Hub provides a place for students to engage with new technologies and explore their creative aspirations, according to Undeen.
“The goal was to create a space on campus where students could be creative, where we could support on-campus learning through hands-on activities, provide exposure to new technologies such as 3D printing and laser cutting,” Undeen said in an interview with The Hoya. “Really an expansion of the Gelardin New Media Center’s mission to provide access to resources and a space for building creative communities.”
Both individuals and student groups use the space to create many types of projects that further a variety of purposes. Noah Martin (COL ’17, GRD ’19) started a social goods venture titled “FM-31,” that produced sustainable, handcrafted goods related to social justice issues, such as sustainably created outdoor field guides, through the resources and machines provided by the Maker Hub.
The space allowed Martin and his team to achieve a tangible result for the project, he said.
“The Maker Hub has been crucial to our work and is, perhaps most importantly, a welcoming space for anyone and everyone who has an idea they want to bring from the conceptual to the physical,” Martin said in an interview with The Hoya.
One philosophy Undeen believes guides the path of the Maker Hub is the concept HOMAGO, an acronym for “hanging out, messing around, and geeking out.” This mantra has been important in shaping the concept of the Maker Hub in the library, according to Undeen.
“First, you build a space that people want to hang out in — you make it comfortable and you make it welcoming, a place that people want to be,” Undeen said. “Then, you make tools and resources and technologies available in a very convenient way so people want to mess around.” 
The Maker Hub supplies specified resources to members of the Georgetown community, according to Undeen.
“You provide the kinds of resources and people and support and mentors on hand so that, when people want to really geek, you are available to help them with that deep dive,” Undeen said. 
A large portion of the funding for Maker Hub comes from the library under the budget for Gelardin. However, the Maker Hub also receives many resources through donations from the wider Georgetown community including legos, knitting needles and yarn.
Over the years, Maker Hub has expanded its involvement in the community by offering workshops from bookbinding to creating last-minute gifts for Valentine’s Day. The Idea Lab, a space within the Maker Hub, also provides an area for classes and clubs to meet, including Hoyarn, the knitting club on campus.
The Maker Neighbor program run by the Maker Hub brings in professionals as volunteers who work two hours a week in their area of specialization to help students and conduct workshops in many different fields.
For the three years it has existed on Georgetown’s campus, the Maker Hub has been a welcoming place that encourages both creativity and fun, according to a university news release.
“The Maker Hub has been a go-to creative space where students can connect with researchers and entrepreneurs to design, solve problems, experiment, and innovate,” the news release said.
By evolving to the Georgetown community’s needs, the Maker Hub has grown from a room with bare walls and three workbenches to a room with vibrant colors and creative energies, according to Undeen.
“I want to see the Maker Hub grow but not just in terms of the size here or in this space but in terms of the way we are promoting hands-on learning and creative community all over campus,” Undeen said.

Questions on intersectional identities and law enforcement will be added to the Cultural Climate Survey following a meeting between administrators and student leaders Thursday, according to Georgetown University Student Association senator Daniella Sanchez (COL ’22).
The survey, conducted by the Cultural Climate Survey committee in the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action, will collect data to measure students’ experiences of Georgetown University’s culture. New questions proposed by a GUSA petition include topics about policing on and off campus, culturally reflective curriculum, bias in the classroom from students and faculty, accessibility, LGBTQ issues, religious life, socioeconomic status and national origin.
The GUSA petition has been signed by 160 students and 10 organizations supporting the inclusion of the new questions at the time of publication.
The Cultural Climate Survey committee met Oct. 10 to give students the chance to present the petition’s questions and discuss how and if they could be included in the survey, which is expected to be sent to the student body next semester. While the committee is still working on the questions’ specific phrasing, the committee decided to include questions about on and off campus policing, accessibility and documentation status, according to Sanchez, who was in the meeting.
“I was a little bit hesitant walking in,” Sanchez said in an interview with The Hoya. “I knew that they were open to hearing our suggestions, especially after the petition, which really opened the door for us. I didn’t know how open they would be to actually implementing it. Walking out, I feel confident that the administration is trying to actually work with us and implement the ideas.”
Prior to the meeting on Oct. 10, a three-person GUSA senate committee met with administrators and staff multiple times since Aug. 20 to write questions for the survey.
The GUSA senate unanimously approved a motion Oct. 6 to support advocating for the ideas represented by the 39 new questions.
Moving forward, the team of administrators, staff and students writing the survey will work to refine the questions to reflect inclusivity, according to Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action Vice President Rosemary Kilkenny (LAW ’87).
“The questions are still being finalized and were never limited to race alone,” Kilkenny wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We recognize the many dimensions of diversity and the importance of intersectionality.”
The GUSA petition helped administrators understand how strongly students feel about the proposed questions, Sanchez said.
“The petition definitely forced the administration to have this discussion with us,” Sanchez said in an interview with The Hoya. “I guess it was a demonstration of how serious we were. We weren’t just giving suggestions based on nothing. These were substantive and students care.”
Given recent events on campus, law enforcement questions are essential to the survey, according to GUSA senator Zev Burton (SFS ’22). GUPD garnered attention after an officer was involved in an altercation with Our Daily Planet reporter Kurt Bardella at the Climate Forum 2020 on Sept. 19.
“It is our responsibility to look internally and say ‘How is our policing doing?’” Burton said in an interview with The Hoya. “I really enjoy the fact that they have a statistician on their team making sure the questions are as unbiased as possible, but to not have policing in there at all is honestly naive and it kind of goes against the Jesuit value of self-reflection.”
The new questions would provide the university with new data to inform future initiatives, Sanchez said.
“Right now, we’re telling them things, but without this data that we’re hoping to see from this climate survey, there’s nothing pushing the administration to do something,” Sanchez said.
Although adding questions would make the survey longer, the data is crucial for future GUSA legislation and university actions, according to Burton.
“As a Jewish kid at a Jesuit school, naturally I want questions of religion to be in there,” Burton said. “With some of my best friends being LGBTQ at a Jesuit school, naturally there should be LGBTQ questions in there. Race is one of the biggest issues, but it is not the only issue.”

This is the RACIAL AND CULTURAL CLIMATE SURVEY!!!! Race is THE biggest issue. We are profiled on the daily, forced to show our ID cards to prove we are students on this campus. Race on the RACIAL and Cultural Climate survey should be one of the biggest issues! Yes it is not the only issue, but it is THE BIG issue! 
Why are you excluding RACE from the title of the survey? Fix this!
Make administration acknowledge that this is about RACE not just CULTURE!

Georgetown University joined 18 other colleges and universities in filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court on Oct. 7 in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
The brief highlights the contributions and perspectives that DACA recipients bring to the university’s campus and includes the stories of three Georgetown students without documentation. In filing the document, Georgetown recognized that the university itself is not a party in the lawsuit but an institution with great interest and insightful information relevant to the case.
President Donald Trump’s administration announced in September 2017 that it will be ending DACA, prompting over ten lawsuits, including those from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Regents of the University of California, arguing that the termination of the program was unlawful. On Oct. 9, Trump called upon the Supreme Court to review and rescind DACA, stating that he would work on a bipartisan deal instead if the policy is repealed by the court.
Hoyas for Immigrant Rights, a student organization that advocates for immigrant students on and off campus, is deeply concerned with the implications of overturning DACA, according to HFIR President Arisaid Gonzalez Porras (COL ’21). 
“The court’s ruling will affect the future of 800,000 people and everyone surrounding them,” Gonzalez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “If the Supreme Court doesn’t uphold the lower courts’ decisions to block Trump’s attempts to kill DACA, everyone will lose their work authorization and protection from deportation.”
DACA, introduced by former President Barack Obama in 2012, provides immigrants without documentation who arrived in the country before the age of 16 with rights and protections, including eligibility for work permits and renewable protection from deportation.
The brief, signed by 19 colleges and universities, highlights that many DACA recipients are gifted and motivated students. The document also details some of the negative effects that rescinding DACA could have on society, discussing these implications by evaluating how these students will contribute to society through their aspirations and future career paths. 
Georgetown student and DACA recipient Juan Jose Martinez Guevara (SFS ’20), one of the three DACA recipients included in Georgetown’s comments in the brief, elaborated on his dream to pursue a career in public service. 
“Work for government – to help achieve what is best for America in the world and to help make the world a safer place,” Guevara wrote in the brief.
Students without documentation face anxiety and injustice in fear of a DACA repeal, scared not only for their own safety but also for that of their families, according to Gonzalez.
“DACA recipients that have not yet graduated, will not be able to enter their career field without their employment authorization,” Gonzalez wrote. “But the biggest risk of them all, is that the government has all of the information of DACA recipients, including their families. It’s being a red dot on their radar and if the program ends, what stops them from starting deportations?”
This amicus brief is not the first time Georgetown has expressed public support for the DACA program and its recipients. In October 2017, University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) and other university presidents urged Congress to pass the Dream Act, legislation that would grant residency status to many minors who are currently part of DACA. 
While the future of DACA is uncertain, Georgetown officials strive to protect the safety of students without documentation on campus. The university released a statement supporting students without documentation in June 2019, highlighting available campus resources. 
Georgetown will continue making resources available to students without documentation at the university, according to Arelis Palacios, associate director for undocumented student services.
“Whether it be free legal services through our partnership with Catholic Charities Immigration Legal Services or on-campus advising, we remain fully dedicated to supporting our undocumented students and the unique challenges they face,” Palacios wrote in an email to The Hoya.

The first Jack the Bulldog statue was installed outside the Healey Family Student Center on Sept. 24, commemorating the legacy of Georgetown University’s bulldog mascots.
While the university has not confirmed whether the sculpture depicts a specific Jack, the statue is inspired by Jack Sr., the mascot from 2003 to 2013, according to Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J. Steck was the caretaker of Jack Sr., who lived with Steck on the fourth floor of New South Hall while Jack Sr. was mascot. 
Janet Pfister, former executive assistant to University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95), led the creation of the statue, which was sculpted by Brian Hanlon, a nationally acclaimed sculptor. Pfister had a close relationship with Jack Sr. and often helped take care of the mascot while she was the executive assistant, according to Steck. 
The statue serves to physically commemorate the memory of Jack Sr., whose loving personality had a strong influence on all those around him, according to Pfister.
“Jack touched our lives with his endearing expressions, his entertaining mannerisms, and his loving devotion to Father Steck and all of his Hoya family,” Pfister wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I felt it was so important to preserve his memory not just in our hearts, but in an enduring memorial on the Georgetown campus, the home he knew and loved for his entire life.”
The statue was funded by Bob Hohmann (GSB ’68), who was involved with the Georgetown men’s basketball program during John Thompson Jr.’s tenure as coach of the team from 1972 to 1999, according to Steck. 
Hohmann funded the employment of the first head caretaker of Jack’s Crew, the group that cares for the bulldog, starting in 2008, Steck wrote.
“When demands surrounding the mascot increased (lots of requests for Jack attending different functions on and off campus), and I found myself needing to hire a student to organize Jack’s schedule, Bob stepped in to provide the funding,” Steck wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The university has not installed a plaque specifying details of the history of Jack. However, a bronze donor plaque is planned for the end of October, according to Carla Tiberi, a senior project manager and landscape architect at Georgetown. 
The university’s decision not to currently specify which Jack the statue is modeled after creates an all-encompassing representation of the mascot, according to a former Jack Crew member Matthew Lewis (COL ’99, GRD ’06).
“I certainly think there would be value to having some sort of plaque to commemorate what exactly this Jack was but I understand the university’s position on a more “universalist” all-encompassing Jack representation,” Lewis wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Before Jack Sr., most Jack the Bulldogs were not seen much on campus, according to Steck. As a mascot, Jack the Bulldog became an integral and active part of the Georgetown community when Jack Sr. arrived on campus in 2003. Once Jack Sr. began performing his “box trick” at basketball games in 2005, the mascot started to become more popular, according to Steck.
“The mascot really took off with the box trick,” Steck said in an interview with The Hoya. “A certain time out would happen, and they’d paint a box in colors of the opposing team’s logo. Jack loved to attack boxes, so it was easy to get him to go after it.” 
The “box trick” increased Jack Sr.’s popularity, causing demand for the mascot to grow across campus, Steck said. 
“It was a very popular trick, and it put Jack on the radar screen for people,” Steck said. “He walked around the concords and then I set up a website to help me with requests for Jack, and it just kind of grew and grew.”
Moving forward, the statue can be incorporated into a new Georgetown tradition to honor Jack Sr., according to Steck.
“Pat his head for health and happiness and rub his [letter] G for goodness and greatness,” Steck said.

Georgetown University launched a new Georgetown.edu homepage Oct. 9 which includes new multimedia content, user-friendly navigation and added visuals. 
The new website, which will use the content management system WordPress, is the first major website redesign for the university since 2010. Vice President of Public Affairs Erik Smulson and Vice President for Information Technology Judd Nicholson notified the Georgetown community of the transition in an email Tuesday evening. 
The website redesign will help to spread Georgetown’s mission by better informing visitors about information on the university. The new design will also showcase the school’s best qualities and improve the website experience for individuals both inside and outside of the Georgetown community, according to Nicholson. 
“We hope that prospective students, undergraduate and graduate, will better understand what makes Georgetown different and the opportunities available to them as a student,” Nicholson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Woven throughout, viewers will experience the real impact of our Catholic and Jesuit identity, location in DC, research and academic expertise and diverse community.” 
The old website could not support some of the visual elements that aid in conveying the Georgetown experience, according to Nicholson. 
“We wanted Georgetown.edu to be able to tell our story in visually compelling and dynamic ways that our previous site couldn’t accommodate,” Nicholson wrote. “We sought to incorporate multimedia that resonates with current and prospective students, such as first-person student video or social media posts.” 
The university worked with Digital Pulp, a New York-based digital agency that has previously worked with Harvard University, Columbia University and the University of Virginia on website redesign, according to Nicholson and Smulson’s email to the Georgetown community. 
Although Digital Pulp did provide expertise in higher education website redesign, the website redesign also required efforts from many members of the Georgetown community, according to Nicholson. 
Georgetown.edu’s “Areas of Study” page hosts information about possible majors and minors, making it crucial for students, according to Nicolo Ferretti (SFS ’21), the Georgetown University Student Association director of university affairs and the student representative to the Top Tier Redesign working group comprised of students, staff and faculty from each Georgetown school who regularly met to review and give feedback on the site’s layout, design and copy. Consequently, the redesign focused on clarifying that page for students and faculty.
“In its first form, the areas of study page did not have the option to separate majors by school, so it was unclear what school you would have to apply to or transfer to enroll in a major,” Ferretti wrote in an email to The Hoya. “By adding better filters, we allowed students to easily explore their academic options.”
Beyond improving website experiences for the current Georgetown community, the redesign will hopefully also yield benefits for prospective students, according to Ferretti.
“Once someone is actually enrolled at Georgetown, they don’t really interface with Georgetown.edu a lot because they are using MyAccess, Canvas, and Starrez platforms straightaway,” Ferretti wrote. “Because of this, a lot of the newest features try to make the experience of prospective Hoyas better.” 
The new website provides an equally operative experience for all users, including those with vision or hearing needs, by fulfilling the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AA, instructions released by the World Wide Web Consortium to make online resources accessible for those with disabilities. Web design experts from the working group assisted in improving the website’s accessibility, according to Ferretti. 
“The working group featured web design experts who were super into making the interface accessible,” Ferretti wrote. “I think the central webpage does a good job in being perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.”
The redesign from the old Drupal operating system stretches beyond the homepage and main tabs. Academic departments including Georgetown College’s mathematics and statistics department have been working with University Information Services to transition to the WordPress content management system, according to Department Administrator Robert Pike. 
The College’s mathematics and statistics department started its transition to the new website in the spring, earlier than most departments, and the shift has gone smoothly, according to Pike. 
“The Mathematics and Statistics Department has had an easy transition. The folks at UIS made the WordPress migration very successful, offering training and being very responsive to outstanding issues and our accessibility,” Pike wrote in an email to The Hoya.  “Additionally our staff users who contribute to the site have embraced what is seen as an easier user-friendly format with WordPress than the previous Drupal interface.”

Politicians must focus on bipartisanship and common sense to appeal to broad audiences, according to Governor Larry Hogan (R-Md.) at an event on Monday.
The event, “Working Across the Aisle: A Conversation with Gov. Larry Hogan,” was hosted by Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service and Georgetown University College Republicans at the Healey Family Student Center. The dialogue was led by GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94).
Getting a Republican governor elected in Maryland, where 60% of constituents are registered as Democrats, was possible by focusing on problems identified by both political parties, according to Hogan.
Hogan said he strives to identify areas of cooperation for both parties. Democrats and Republicans may disagree on solutions, but identifying common issue areas can lead to bipartisan action, according to Hogan.
“We have tried to find that middle ground, where we can all stand together,” Hogan said.“We both agree that there’s a problem that needs to be fixed.”
Health care is an issue that both political parties in Washington, D.C, have failed to adequately address, Hogan said. The federal government must come to a unified consensus on health care policy to prevent nationwide fragmentation on health insurance policy, according to Hogan.
“The Republicans and Democrats, they just can’t ever have a conversation about [health care],” Hogan said. “But we actually got it done. We shouldn’t have 50 different states coming up with 50 different solutions, but we couldn’t wait.”
Working with leaders from both political parties in the state legislature made the renewal of the all-payer model of health care possible following federal approval from the Trump administration in 2018, according to Hogan.
“We got a unique all-payer model of healthcare that we got approved through the Trump administration — the only one of its kind in America,” Hogan said. “It was a real, bipartisan, common-sense solution.”
Maryland’s all-payer healthcare system was implemented in 2014, which allows the state to regulate hospital rates. The “Maryland Model” saved more than $586 million for Medicare within its first two years and is projected to save $1 billion for Medicare over the next five years, according to a press release by the Maryland Department of Health.
Hogan’s healthcare plan levied a tax against insurance companies, and the resulting revenue created a $380 million fund that was used to pay off the largest health insurance claims and stabilize the individual insurance market.
Hogan was first elected as governor in 2014 and won reelection in 2018, making him only the second Republican in the state’s history to serve a second term. Hogan currently has a 64% approval rating, according to a quarterly survey by Morning Consult.
Hogan is currently the chairman of the National Governors Association, where he has focused on issues such as improving and modernizing national infrastructure. Democratic and Republican governors across the nation work cohesively to resolve problems, helping them accomplish more than national legislators who are hindered by partisanship, according to Hogan.
“We are not on different teams,” Hogan said. “We don’t fight every week in committee. Governors on both sides of the aisle are accomplishing more than them.”
When running for his first term as governor, the Maryland economy was suffering while recovering from the Great Recession, which caused people to leave the state, according to Hogan. By focusing on practical economic issues and using his business background, his initial campaign aimed to directly solve these problems, according to Hogan.
“I come at this from a different perspective than most people,” Hogan said. “I was a small business man, who had never held elected office before. I ran a campaign saying, ‘I am going to solve problems instead of playing political games.’”

Georgetown University students demonstrated in support of LGBTQ labor rights outside of the Supreme Court Oct. 8 as opening arguments on three high-profile cases were presented to the court.
The Supreme Court heard two cases on whether LGBTQ rights are protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. One case, Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, involves a man who alleges he was fired from his job in Georgia after his employer learned he was gay. Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda, a similar case in which a skydiving instructor at New York’s Altitude Express was fired for sharing that he was gay with a client, was combined with Bostock v. Clayton Country, Georgia at the Supreme Court.
The second case, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, centers around a Michigan woman who says she was fired from her job at a funeral home for publicly coming out as transgender.  R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is the first case regarding transgender rights to be heard by the Supreme Court.  
Hundreds gathered in the demonstrations organized by the Human Rights Campaign, American Civil Liberties Union, National Center for Transgender Equality and National LGBTQ Task Force. Around 10 Georgetown students participated in the demonstrations, according to Isai Soto (COL ’23), a GUPride and Georgetown University’s Queer People of Color member who attended the protest. 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. Lawyers representing President Donald Trump’s administration are pushing for the court to uphold lower courts’ decisions that the term “sex,” as defined in the parameters of employment discrimination in Title VII, does not apply to sexual orientation and gender identity, according to The Washington Post.
Participating in the protests outside the Supreme Court was essential to demonstrating support for the LGBTQ community, according to Soto.
“It was a really important thing to be there to show my support for my community as well as showing face for others there,” Soto said. “I don’t identify as a transgender person nor as a nonbinary person, but I understand the solidarity that comes with it.”  
Over 100 protestors were arrested during the demonstrations for crowding, obstructing or incommoding, according to Newsweek. As a queer woman of color, these arrests are concerning because they imply voicing opinions on LGBTQ issues can put a person in danger, demonstrator Jade Ferguson (SFS ’22) said. 
“It’s crazy thinking that standing up for what I believe in puts me in a place where I could possibly be in trouble and be in danger,” Ferguson said. “Especially as a queer woman of color where our judicial and law system are tainted in favor of white males.”
The current administration has refused to include the LGBTQ community under the coverage of Title VII, leaving the LGBTQ community fearful of job security and safety, GUPride co-president Al Castillo (SFS ’22) wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“Although LGBTQ+ Americans exist in every crossroad of life, we still live in fear of job termination, discrimination, and violence within the workplace,” Castillo wrote. “Excluding our queer, transgender, and non-binary workers from Title VII will validate the unjust treatment we endure instead of dismantling the homophobia and transphobia in companies and businesses.”
These cases are monumental for the transgender community and present an opportunity to stand up for their rights, Castillo wrote.
“For the transgender and non-binary community, it is the first time we are represented in the federal government, and we have the opportunity to speak up for our necessary liberties,” Castillo wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Alongside groups advocating for the rights of gay and transgender workers, the protests included many anti-LGBTQ rights counter protestors. In response to anti-LGBTQ rights advocates, Soto held a sign saying “Fellas, Is It Gay To Have a Job?” 
Obstacles to any LGBTQ rights demonstrations, such as anti-LGBTQ slurs and sayings, strengthen the movement by bringing the LGBTQ community closer together, according to Ferguson.
“I think it brings us closer together because we all laugh at it together and we’ll make that a photo op; we all take the time to point it out,” Ferguson said. “Our community is strengthened even more in the face of opposition.”
Seeing other Georgetown student demonstrators outside the Supreme Court reflects the politically active campus environment of the university, according to Soto.  
“I think there’s the Georgetown label of politically active students and I feel like we’re used to being upset with the administration or higher up,” Soto said. “Of course we’re going to rally behind this because we’ll rally behind other things on campus too.”

The accurate portrayal of people with disabilities in media is central to advancing the disability rights movement, actor and singer James Ian (MSB ’05, LAW ’10) said at a panel discussion in the Fisher Colloquium on Thursday.
The event, titled “Disability and Inclusion in the Entertainment Industry,” featured a performance and conversation with Ian as well as a panel discussion with internationally recognized disability rights activist Judith Heumann and Ian. The event was co-sponsored by the disability studies program, the Georgetown University Disability Alliance and Georgetown Business for Impact as part of its Disability Inclusion Forum, an annual forum centered on closing the disability employment gap. 
Anna Landre (SFS ’21), the co-founder of the Georgetown Disability Alliance, a developing student organization encouraging education on disability issues and advocating for on-campus accessibility, moderated the event. 
Media heavily influences public perception of the experiences of people with disabilities, according to Ian.
“Media often helps to shape our perspectives of things going on in the world, and I think it helps to influence the perspective of how people view people with disabilities,” Ian said. “There’s so many kinds of misconceptions.”
Twenty-six percent of adults in the United States have some type of disability, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, a study by the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School that surveyed 1,100 popular films showed that just 2.4% of characters had disabilities. Furthermore, less than 5% of television characters portrayed with a disability are played by an actor with a disability, according to The Washington Post. 
Some disabilities, like chronic illnesses and mental health conditions, are not immediately apparent to the general public, whereas others are more visible, according to Heumann. All disabilities, however, should be well-represented in the media, Heumann said.
“The community of disabled people is quite broad and quite diverse,” Heumann said. “Many of us in this room have visible disabilities. I don’t know those of you here that have invisible disabilities, but I know that a percentage of you have invisible disabilities.”
People should be more actively engaged in advancing the inclusion of disability more authentically in media, Heumann said.
“When you look at the issue of disability, yes, there’s progress, but it’s still very minimal,” Heumann said. “As consumers of media, which we all are, I think we’re pretty complacent.” 
To protest this injustice, people should not watch films that feature an able-bodied person playing the role of a disabled person, Ian said. 
“The industry wants to tell our stories, but they’re not trying to use us to tell that,” Ian said. “If you see a production and there is not a disabled person in the role as a disabled person, you know, dollars are very powerful — don’t go see that film or don’t watch it.”
On Georgetown’s campus, elevators in O’Donovan Hall, Copley Hall, the Leavey Center and the Southwest Quadrangle have experienced malfunctions in the past year. Across campus, Americans with Disabilities Act buttons on automatic doors, including in the Leavey Center, throughout academic departments in the Intercultural Center and at the Student Health Center, are broken or absent.
Ian, a Georgetown alumnus, said the university’s lack of accessibility negatively affected his time at the university.
“When I lived in Village C freshman year, the elevators were always broken in that building; they’d be broken in Healy, too, and it was difficult,” Ian said. “I would always complain, and they would never get fixed.”
Ian lives with two rare diseases: proximal spinal muscular atrophy type 3, which is characterized by muscle weakness and hypotonia, and Parsonage-Turner Syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes severe pain in the shoulder and arm. 
Ian kicked off the event with a three-song acoustic performance before participating in the panel. Music gives Ian the opportunity to explain his disabilities to an audience in a positive way, he said. 
“I can be an advocate through the arts because I have this platform where I can talk about it and I can reach a good amount of people,” Ian said.

Technological development should focus on promoting the public interest, panelists said during the inaugural gathering of the Public Interest Technology University Network in the Rafik B. Hariri Building on Monday.
Georgetown is one of the founding members of PIT-UN, a partnership among 21 colleges and universities. The network aims to develop the field of public interest technology, which focuses on how innovative technology interacts with government policy. The PIT-UN supports technologists and policy leaders who will shape the field of public interest technology in the future through its various programs.
The event was composed of several panels featuring filmmaker Ava DuVernay, Ford Foundation President Darren Walker and other leaders in higher education, philanthropic and public policy communities.
Sharing stories with each other can contribute to a more inclusive environment in the field of technology, according to DuVernay, who spoke at the first panel, “Technology, Race, and Our Future.”
“We’re all storytellers; everyone will walk out of this space and talk about what happened here to tell the story about what they learned,” DuVernay said. “We need to create more forums like this, more opportunities to share with each other.”
Using technology for good means advancing the public interest, not the ideas of good and evil that have been appropriated and turned into brands, according to Walker, who spoke on the panel with DuVernay.
“We have been very unwavering in our idea that this must be rooted in the notion of a public interest,” Walker said. “The idea of the public interest is a space where the private interests and our interests intersect, and that is often a contested space.”
Since PIT-UN’s launch in March 2019, universities in the network have developed degrees, programs and new initiatives to support leaders pursuing technology careers with an emphasis on the public good, according to the network’s website. Georgetown launched the Tech & Society Initiative, which seeks to develop new courses that consider the intersection of technology and the topics of ethics and governance.
The event also included panelists from the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, two regulatory government agencies that seek to protect consumers and promote growth in the technology sector in addition to enforcing antitrust laws and regulating interstate communications.
The intersection of public policy and technology is more important now than ever to solve societal problems, according to University Provost Robert Groves, who introduced the first panel.
“We see in our lives a rate of technological change that is unprecedented and we want to use it to impact society exponentially,” Groves said. “We envisioned intentional development to use technology to solve pressing problems of the world.”
Two Georgetown faculty teams were announced at the conference as PIT-UN grant recipients out of a total of 27 grants awarded nationally through the organization. The network supports the development of new public interest technology initiatives and institutions in academia through its PIT-UN Challenge Fund.
Georgetown College professor Maggie Little and founding director of the Center for Security and Emerging Technology Jason Matheny were awarded $85,991 from the Challenge Fund for their proposal as a team to study the integration of ethics in the context of the governance of artificial intelligence.
Alexandra Givens, executive director of the Institute for Technology Law and Policy and Paul Ohm, faculty director of the Georgetown Center on Privacy & Technology, were awarded $36,000 as a team for their proposal to strengthen cross-disciplinary research of computer science and law.
Universities can do more to develop the field of public interest technology by incentivizing interdisciplinary studies, according to Walker.
“Universities are always at the center of transformation, and certainly in this country have been, and we won’t solve this without having universities change their behavior,” Walker said. “What we at the foundation can do is help to provide the catalyzing feed resources to pilot and test some of these ideas and to partner with the public and private sector.”
The promotion of the public interest seeks to ensure the protection of the most vulnerable in society, Walker said.
“We need today in our new digital world to articulate and defend and protect the idea of the public interest in a digital world,” Walker said. “Unfortunately that public interest has been defined primarily by private interests and corporate interests.”

The President’s Awards for Distinguished Scholar-Teachers will be presented to four Georgetown University professors in recognition of their research and commitment to teaching students at the fall faculty convocation Oct. 23, the university announced last week.
The award is granted by the President’s Office after a nomination process by both students and faculty members. The accolade includes a $10,000 annual grant to the professors over three academic years to support their research.
Three Georgetown College professors received the award, including history professor John McNeill, Spanish and Portuguese professor Cristina Sanz, and linguistics professor Alison Mackey. Neuroscience professor Italo Mocchetti at the Georgetown University Medical Center was also honored. 
These faculty members set themselves apart in their simultaneous commitment to their fields and to Georgetown itself, according to University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95).
“Our awardees represent the very best of Georgetown: the blending of academic expertise, innovative research, and impactful pedagogy that draws out the ambitions and abilities of our students and faculty,” DeGioia said in a news release announcing the recipients. 
The President’s Awards are part of President DeGioia’s initiative to support academic and social impact causes, according to the office’s website.
Georgetown College Dean Christopher Celenza was impressed by each of the College honoree’s embodiment of the values of the College, which he believes lie at the core of Georgetown’s history and identity, he said.
“I think all of them do a lot of things that are the ideals at Georgetown,” Celenza said in an interview with The Hoya. “All are very committed to advanced research in their fields. Yet, despite this research excellence and being recognized by their peers for all of this, with publications and grants and awards and so on, each one of them is still a very committed teacher as well.”
Finding the right balance between influential research and university teaching is an important part of the College’s mission, according to Celenza.
“We want to make sure our faculty members are leaders in their fields, but we are also so proud that they feel that interaction with students is very, very important,” Celenza said.
McNeill, one of the awardees, is the current President of the American Historical Association and has taught more than 3,000 students at Georgetown since he began as a professor in 1985. McNeill has earned multiple awards and fellowships throughout his career, including two Fulbright research awards and fellowships from the MacArthur Foundation and the Woodrow Wilson Center.
Apart from his accomplishments, the most rewarding aspects of his work are the lasting connections he has developed with certain Georgetown students, McNeill said.
“Most students, I believe, quickly forget most of their teachers, including me,” McNeill wrote in an email to The Hoya. “But some don’t, some stay in touch, and some get back in touch, out of the blue, after many years. I always appreciate that.”
Sanz, the current chair of the department of Spanish and Portuguese, conducts interdisciplinary research on second-language acquisition and multilingualism. Her studies center around methods of language learning and teaching including computerized instruction and immersion abroad.
In addition to her many scholarly accomplishments, teaching students is one of the most gratifying aspects of Sanz’s work at Georgetown, she said.
“I get to teach courses on the stuff that I conduct research on, so I can teach graduate seminars on the complicated variables that intervene, for good or bad, in the acquisition of another language,” Sanz said in an interview with The Hoya. “My research talks to my teaching, but my research also informs my practitioner hat.”
Seeing the effects that her teaching can have on students is incredibly fulfilling, according to Mackey.
“Students frequently use methods, approaches and techniques they learned about in this class in their master’s papers and dissertation work, often flawlessly because they piloted and worked out issues in the methods class,” Mackey wrote.
All of Mackey’s colleagues represent the values the Georgetown community is committed to, which makes the award even more special, she said.
“I am in awe of my wonderful, talented and caring colleagues, how much they know, and how much they are prepared to give to their work at Georgetown, how seriously they take the business of educating our students—all this exemplifies cura personalis for me,” Mackey wrote. “Being selected for this award by a committee of my colleagues is the greatest recognition and reward for my life’s work I could hope for.”

Six candidates for Washington, D.C. Council, including three from Ward 2, have signed the “No Pepco Pledge,” agreeing to not accept campaign contributions from Pepco, Washington Gas and fossil fuel companies.
The pledge calls for candidates to refuse campaign donations from D.C.-area electricity provider Pepco, Washington Gas and other fossil fuel companies and to disclose detailed information about meetings with Pepco and Washington Gas representatives and lobbyists. It also calls for candidates to support all legislation on studying the economic feasibility of alternative utility models.
350 DC, a local climate advocacy organization, launched the pledge Oct. 4 to encourage the use of renewable resources like wind, hydroelectric and solar power in D.C. 
Currently, there are five candidates running in Ward 2 to replace incumbent councilmember Jack Evans. Evans has not yet filed paperwork to run for reelection to the seat he has held since 1991 but has until March 5, 2020, to do so. Ward 2 Democratic primary candidates Jordan Grossman, Daniel Hernandez and Kishan Putta, Ward 4 candidate Janeese Lewis George and Ward 7 candidates Kelvin Brown and Anthony Lorenzo Green have all signed the pledge.
Evans continues to be investigated for allegations that he violated D.C. Council ethical guidelines by using his position for business gain, including accepting payments in exchange for political favors. 
All five candidates from Ward 2 are participating in the Fair Elections Program, which dictates that they cannot accept corporate contributions.
By eliminating corporate money from politics, D.C. can further develop its sustainability, according to Grossman. 
“We need to get corporate money out of our politics in order to build a more sustainable future in DC,” Grossman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “That’s what the No Pepco Pledge is all about, and it’s why I’m proud to be one of the first candidates to sign on to it. The pledge is one demonstration of how, if I’m elected, I’ll make decisions based on merits, not based on contributions from corporations or their lobbyists.”
People must recognize and reject Pepco’s lobbying efforts in the District, according to Hernandez.
“I hope the pledge brings greater awareness to Pepco’s lobbying efforts within the District and create greater pushback against it,” Hernandez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I hope it helps demonstrate I’m running to stand for people, not corporations and I’m committed to the climate change fight.”
The existential threat posed by climate change should compel government officials to take action, according to Putta. 
“We cannot afford distractions from this goal and we need to ensure that our government is focused on this goal. That’s why I am proud to sign this pledge,” Putta wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I have nothing personally against the employees of these companies. But this is an existential crisis and our leaders need to be focused. I intend to try to lead by example.”
Pepco sources 29.8% of its energy from coal and 28.7% from natural gas, according to its environmental fuel source information. Only 5.8% is from renewable sources. 
The other two candidates running for the Ward 2 seat, John Fanning and Patrick Kennedy, have not yet signed the pledge.
Fanning does not intend to accept money from fossil fuel companies but has not signed the pledge, he wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Although Fanning has not yet signed the pledge, he said he is happy to do so and has not received contributions from any employee of Pepco or its parent company, Exelon Corporation.
While the District should move toward a more sustainable future, the second tenet of the pledge — disclosing detailed minutes of meetings with lobbyists — could create problems, according to Kennedy.
“Having to take minutes of meetings with Pepco or utilities or whomever, is I think unworkable in practice,” he said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think it inhibits the free flow of information between a business that is pretty important to the constituents.”

Two out of service six-car trains collided outside Farragut West at 12:54 a.m. Oct. 7 causing delays and overcrowding across three Metro lines, as authorities opened an investigation into the incident.
The crash occurred when Train 700 crashed into the immobile Train 755 at 11 mph outside Farragut West Station, according to statements released by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. The trains were being moved back to their home railyards, and the only people on board at the time of the crash were the two operators.
Although both operators initially observed stop commands coming through the signaling system and each train came to a full stop, Train 700 eventually accelerated and collided with Train 755, according to an Oct. 7 WMATA news release.
“Event recorders show Train 755 and Train 700 responded to the signal system commands and came to a stop, as required,” the news release reads. “The investigation is currently working to establish the sequence of events between Train 700 coming to a stop and the collision with Train 755.”
The crash resulted in delays and packed platforms for Blue, Silver and Orange Line commuters on Monday, with effects lasting through Tuesday, Oct. 8. WMATA tweets and press releases outlined 15-minute delays during the entire day of the accident.
While a 6:44 a.m. tweet from WMATA on Tuesday claimed normal operations had resumed, customers like Julie Malear pushed back.
“From someone who just spent 24 mins waiting for a blue line toward Fraconica at this station, I’d say normal operations have not resumed,” Malear wrote in a tweet.
Georgetown students were also affected by Monday’s delays, including Timothy Tan (COL ’23), a commuter student who makes a daily route from northern Virginia to Georgetown. 
“The trains were disrupted a bit because of the crash,” Tan said in an interview with The Hoya. “Usually my commute takes about 30 or 40 minutes on the Metro, but it took probably an hour yesterday.”
Because of the delay, the trains were very tight on space as commuters were anxious to get on the next train home, according to Tan.
“They were running basically two lines in one train, so there were twice as many people on each train,” he said. “It was very packed. People had to shove their way through to get on.”
Investigators have concluded that the crash was not a signaling error problem and relayed that human factors as a possible cause of the crash were being considered, according to WMATA. 
“Data analysis shows that all trains were properly detected by the signal system, and appropriate speed commands were sent to the trains to maintain safe spacing,” the Oct. 7 release said. “The investigation is also reviewing human factors as a possible cause.”
The operators of both trains were given mandatory drug and alcohol tests and will remain out of service for the remainder of the investigation.
The WMATA takes a holistic approach when investigating potentially employee-related incidents, according to Dan Stessel, chief communications officer for the WMATA.
“The investigation will take into account all of the factors, including the employee’s work history, results of toxicology tests, interviews and statements, as well as possible contributing factors such as fatigue, outside employment, changes to work schedule/overtime, inattention due to prohibited electronic device use, etc.,” Stessel wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Based on a full review of all factors, Metro will apply disciplinary action in accordance with our policies and applicable labor agreements.”
Authorities have yet to determine the cause of the crash, however, as there is still more evidence to collect, according to Stessel.
“We want to make sure we have all of the information before we draw any formal conclusions,” Stessel wrote in an email with The Hoya. “We expect to have a root cause in the coming weeks.”
Metrorail accidents can be a way of exposing flaws in the system, according to Stessel.
“Metrorail carries between 650K-700K passenger trips on a typical weekday, and safety incidents are extremely rare. You have a greater risk of injury in a car, bike or scooter than you do on Metrorail,” Stessel said in an email with The Hoya. “That said, even one safety incident is too many, and that’s why you see a thorough investigation to understand exactly what happened and identify ways to make the system even safer going forward.”
