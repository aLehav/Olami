While most students spend their summers away from the Hilltop, GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) hope to take advantage of these three months to accomplish items on their unofficial summer agenda.
Along with summer manager Alyssa Peterson (COL ’14), who serves as deputy chief of staff during the academic year, Tisa and Ramadan plan to tackle a variety of student issues, starting with student loan interest rates, which are set to double if Congress does not act by July 1.
After attending President Barack Obama’s speech — which called for young people to take action against the rise in student loan interest rates — at the White House on Friday, Tisa and Ramadan have developed a Georgetown University Student Association initiative for the next month before the legislative deadline.
The pair plans to reach out to student governments across the country to lobby against the interest rate rise, appealing to other student body presidents to write a joint letter against the hike. Through social media, petitions, emails and student group outreach, the GUSA executives hope to mobilize the Georgetown student body to lobby members of Congress to act before July 1.
“I feel like in most cases, GUSA doesn’t actually have a place to be involved in a lot of national issues,” Tisa said. “This issue, though, is something that directly affects students.”
Tisa said this national issue is especially important at Georgetown.
“It also tends to affect the students that have the most financial need the most, which is not good,” he said. “I think that this is one of those issues that GUSA has the responsibility to be involved in.”
More locally, the GUSA executives will prioritize increasing free speech on campus. During their GUSA campaign in February, Tisa and Ramadan called for a campus-wide free speech zone.
“Free speech is number one, and that is going to break down to a lot of components,” Tisa said. “In talking with students and student groups, we found that there’s a lot of different levels that affect the way [free speech] plays out on campus through student culture, where we might not always have an environment that fosters people expressing themselves to the fullest.”
One of those components will be the way student groups’ varying levels of access to space on campus affects free speech as well as the university’s free speech policy.
Tisa and Ramadan also plan to push for basic updates to campus facilities. The executives are working on a program that will allow students to check washing machine and dryer availability before doing their laundry and receive notifications when their laundry is done. Ramadan also hopes to gain approval to paint the concrete walls on MultiSport Facility and Yates Field House.
The pair will also promote continued efforts to ensure policy changes regarding neighborhood relations and the 2010 Campus Plan agreement are fair for both students and permanent residents.
“We are trying to form a lasting partnership … where we speak to neighbors directly about what their concerns are and have more of a dialogue with them that’s constructive and can help us work through other issues on campus,” Peterson said.
The executive cabinet and the Student Advocacy Office will also work to launch an iPhone application that contains the Code of Student Conduct by the end of the summer. The iPhone-friendly version of the code of conduct will be shortened to limit bureaucratic language and increase transparency, Tisasaid.
In addition, the summer agenda includes initiatives to foster diversity on campus, develop a disability peer-to-peer mentoring program, increase academic diversity, create a Georgetown-specific bike share program, explore the development of a GUSA judicial branch and enhance communication anddialogue between GUSA and the student body through social media.
With next year’s administrative staff set and less hectic faculty schedules during the summer, Tisa is optimistic that coordination and dialogue between GUSA and the administration will be more straightforward and easier.
“Now that we know what the staff is going to look like, we know what our mode of operation is going to be, we can start deciding not only what we want to do, but how we want Georgetown to look when we are done,” Tisa said. “We are already working pretty directly with administrators. I think now we just get to spend a lot more quality time with them.”
The unofficial summer agenda comes after the conclusion of the GUSA executive’s 40-day spring agenda, in which Tisa and Ramadan helped push to create the Office of Sustainability, find alternative space for student groups during the construction of the Healey Family Student Center and ease on-campus socializing restrictions, specifically the elimination of the one-keg limit for on-campus parties.

After reviewing a concept proposal for the Northeast Triangle dorm Wednesday morning, the Old Georgetown Board postponed further consideration of the project until its next meeting in September, when Georgetown would be prepared to present all seven dorm options that were explored earlier this year.
The meeting took place two days after the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E unanimously voted to approve the dorm Monday night. OGB and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts must approve the building plans before Georgetown can begin construction, which it hopes to do by spring 2014.
OGB members objected to both the lack of information about alternative options and finished nature of the concept proposal.
“You have got a very finished presentation here. I might just comment that it would be better for us to review a building of this nature in a much sketchier kind of quality,” OGB member David Cox said. “I think part of what you are hearing in that student reaction is that it looks like it’s a done deal. This thing looks like it’s very far down the line in terms of its thought process.”
The current proposal, designed by Sasaki Associates, depicts a seven-story structure that would house 250 sophomores beginning in fall 2015. Northeast Triangle would aid Georgetown in housing 90 percent of undergraduates on campus by 2025, a requirement of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement.
During her presentation to OGB, Assistant Vice President for Planning and Project Management Regina Bleck, joined by two Sasaki architects, described the design as “a transitional element that makes a bridge from the historic quad and the stone work there to the largely brick district on the north side of campus.” However, the proposal has provoked criticism from students and alumni for its design and location on one of the last green spaces available on campus. Approximately 20 students sent emails to OGB ahead of the meeting to note objections to the design.
Following the presentation, the board opened the floor for comments. Alumnus Timothy Walton (SFS’10) criticized the design and cited passionate student and alumni comments on social media that described the design as a “monstrosity” and “hideous.” Walton compared the design for the Northeast Triangle to Lauinger Library and Reiss Science Building, which he said were the least appealing buildings on campus.
“Instead of emulating the best, we went after the worst,” Walton said.
Other concerns raised during the discussion included the fence behind the dorm separating the university and Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School, visibility of the dorm from off campus and its cooling system.
The next OGB meeting will take place Sept. 4. Walton said he was happy with the OGB’s decision to postpone further discussion on this proposal, but said he was dissatisfied with what he saw as insufficient student and alumni input in the dorm proposal.
“I appreciate that the Old Georgetown Board took time to recognize the need for evaluating alternatives and other options as part of the Georgetown master plan and looking for a design that is more consistent with the best of Georgetown’s architecture,” Walton said.
