Despite GUSA President Nate Tisa’s (SFS ’14) veto of the Green Revolving Loan Fund, the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund will open GRLF applications this week.
“We’re not going to fund anyone,” SIPS Fund Managing Director Ethan Chess (COL ’14) said. “Opening up the application doesn’t cost anything. These projects take time to work on, and we want to make sure we are giving students as much opportunity as they can to put their proposals together. … It doesn’t make sense for us to have the process of the fund sit on the sideline for no reason.”
“[The senate bill] doesn’t actually do anything, essentially, because it’s already written in our bylaws that we can give out grants,” SIPS Executive Director Kate Anthony (SFS ’14) added.
On Oct. 20, the GUSA senate voted unanimously to confirm the SIPS Fund’s authority to start issuing grants and loans through the GRLF. Tisa vetoed the bill that Monday out of concern that the senate failed its “due diligence” to craft a stronger, clearer bill.
With two-thirds of the vote, the senate could have voted to override Tisa’s veto. Instead, GUSA Finance and Appropriation Chair Seamus Guerin (COL ’16) said that a new bill that will be introduced Sunday on the senate floor will confirm the SIPS Fund’s authority to dispense grants through the GRLF. The only difference from the vetoed bill will be an added reference to documents from Student Activities Fee Endowment reform, which established SIPS, to improve clarity.
“Honestly, I don’t see the essence of the new bill being much different from the previous one,” Guerin said.
Tisa maintained that SIPS required GUSA approval, despite the implications of its decision to open applications.
“SIPS came to the senate because the university wanted clarification on the grants and loans question. If they did not feel clarification was needed they would not have come to the senate,” Tisa said.
Chess, however, contended that seeking approval and clarification from GUSA was not the SIPS Fund’s original intention.
“We were doing it out of an abundance of advice from the Office of Student Affairs as a triple check on it, and also as just a way to be transparent and share information with the student body, which we’re very committed to doing,” he said.
Meanwhile, the week since Tisa’s veto has largely been portrayed as a power struggle between the student government and the SIPS Fund board.
Former GUSA President and SIPS Fund Co-Founder Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) came to the defense of the fund in the aftermath of the veto. Gustafson endorsed Tisa’s primary opponent in February’s election.
“I think GUSA is just being a little too power mongering. If things are talked about ahead of time and SIPS did talk to the senate committee beforehand, there shouldn’t be any misunderstandings or need for the executive office to veto it,” Gustafson said. “This past week has been GUSA wasting its time in a power battle that means nothing to anyone but themselves.”
Tisa maintained his veto did not overstretch GUSA power but required the student government to fulfill its duty.
Anthony objected to concerns that, in seeking approval to give grants, SIPS would exhaust its resources.
“It was never our intention of going in trying to pass this through the senate and then giving away $200,000 of the GRLF in grants within the first year,” she said.
Although the SIPS Fund is opening applications without the formal approval of the GUSA senate and maintains that it is independent of the student association, it has decided to make an annual presentation to the senate on the status of the GRLF. SIPS has yet to settle on the maximum number of grants it would allocate each year to ensure the longevity of the fund.
“SIPS has been independent of GUSA since the referendum. But that doesn’t release GUSA from our responsibility to represent students, who voted for a specific proposal,” Tisa said. “When SIPS looked to adjust its mission and came asking us whether or not we thought their original mission included grants, we had an obligation to go back to the original documents, look at what students voted for and make sure students are getting what they voted for before we give our confirmation to the administrators who asked for it.”

Though H*yas for Choice quietly introduced a new condom delivery service Oct. 17, the program has prompted a loud response.
The system allows students to request free condom delivery through a Google form 48 hours before an event. Party hosts can then pick up the condoms from the H*yas for Choice table in Red Square or request for them to be delivered to a specific location.
The idea was modeled after a similar program started by Boston College Students for Sexual Health. Boston College threatened disciplinary action if the group broke any university policies, which Boston College Students for Sexual Health has been careful not to do.
“We are lucky enough that Georgetown respects the rights of its students and isn’t going to shut us down. The university can’t tread on our freedom of speech and expression if we go against what they believe in,” H*yas for Choice President Laura Narefsky (COL ’14) said.
While the group has done little to publicize the new initiative, it has been covered by external media, including the Huffington Post and a local Fox affiliate station.
“Anytime a pro-choice group does something on a Catholic campus, people see it as news,” Narefsky said “We are thrilled. It’s great that our message is now reaching people outside the Georgetown community. Hopefully this will become a service we can provide to as many groups on campus as possible.”
This attention, however, has led to passionate responses from students and others who oppose the service, citing a risk of increased sexual assault and incompatibility with religious values.
“This new service simply contributes to the already prevalent hookup culture that reduces men and women to mere objects of physical gratification,” Emile Doak (COL ’14), a member of the conservative group Love Saxa, said. “Saturating alcohol-infused parties with easy access to condoms will only facilitate this objectification.”
Andrew Schilling (COL ’14), a member of the Georgetown Knights of Columbus, said that such the condom distribution system would perpetuate sexual violence.
“Unfortunately, the proposed plan does nothing to tackle the most urgent problems of Georgetown’s current hook-up culture, like the high rate of sexual violence committed against women,” Schilling said. “Instead, it will likely perpetuate the same culture responsible for these problems in the first place.”
Narefsky expressed frustration with this disapproval.
“I find that really shocking. Some of these claims I find offensive, I find them unfounded,” Narefsky said. “I think it’s dangerous to make those kinds of claims. Sex isn’t a dirty word. Protecting yourself in every way possible is a good thing and something we should not shy away from.”
“Our trial run was at a GU Pride party that went really well,” Narefsky said. “It was all inconspicuously in the corner, and all 40 condoms we had there were taken. For us, that was great. We couldn’t have asked for anything better.”
Disapproval for the new initiative has not been limited to the university’s Catholic community. Amin Gharad (COL ’16), a student coordinator of the Muslim Interest Living Community, also voiced concern.
“It’s not just the distribution of condoms that disturbs me, but the fact that efforts are being made to facilitate and tacitly approve of a lifestyle of extramarital sexual relations,” Gharad said. “As a Muslim, it’s not a lifestyle I could ever nod approvingly toward, but, at the same time, it’s a much more deeply rooted problem than something that either banning or distributing condoms will ever be able to solve.”
Gharad acknowledged, however, that his opinion is likely in the minority.
“I’d also venture to say that those who share my views with regards to sexual behavior and the usage of intoxicants are quite few and far between on American college campuses in the year 2013,” he said.
Despite this criticism, the increased attention on H*yas for Choice has largely been positive for the group.
“I definitely wouldn’t say we tried to make a big deal about this, but all press is good press for us,” H*yas for Choice Treasurer Sarah Madoff (COL ’16) said.
The organization currently receives free condoms from the Department of Health and Human Services, Planned Parenthood and The Great American Condom Campaign. The recent press drew the attention of Condom Nation, a condom distribution organization that provides mobile HIV testing.
“Condom Nation has been intrigued by our program and supportive of us and wants to partner with us in the future because they see that this is an important service that we’re providing,” Narefsky said.
Narefsky recognized the potential for publicity on the program to present the image of a more tolerant Georgetown than one typically associated with Catholic universities.
“Via this media coverage, people can see the progressive shift among modern American religious organizations, and that Georgetown understands and respects students’ rights,” she said. “We value our Jesuit education so much, but even if what we are doing goes against the teachings of the Catholic Church, we are still members of this community, and our actions should still be allowed to be performed.”

The U.S. Forest Service is reconsidering its recommendation against horizontal drilling in George Washington National Forest, which activists say could contaminate the water supply in Washington, D.C.
The headwaters of the Potomac, which serve as the water source for around four million D.C. residents, are located within the one-million-acre George Washington National Forest that encompasses the Appalachian Mountain region of Virginia and West Virginia. The National Park Service is in the process of forming a new 15-year plan for GW National Forest, which has been delayed multiple times since March 2012.
The forest service advocated against horizontal drilling in early 2011 due to water pollution concerns, which would affect those receiving water downstream.
Local governments, advocacy groups and citizens have expressed uneasiness in allowing horizontal drilling in GW National Forest. Shenandoah Valley Network Executive Director Kate Wofford described the unusually high public interest and involvement in the forest service’s plan, whose commentary period ended in October 2011.
“The U.S. Service received overwhelming public comments in support of the ban on horizontal drilling,” she said. “53,000 people commented, which is a lot for what’s generally sort of a boring forest plan.”
Ninety-five percent of the comments supported the ban on horizontal drilling.
Major players within the oil and gas industry also sent letters expressing their views, including Halliburton Energy, who declined to comment for this article, and the Independent Petroleum Association of America and the American Petroleum Institute, who did not respond by press time.
The American Petroleum Institute countered the concerns around horizontal drilling with an economic argument.
“The U.S. oil and natural gas industry supports 9.2 million domestic jobs and comprises more than 7.5 percent of the U.S. economy,” the API wrote in its letter, adding that a ban on horizontal drilling “would frustrate efforts to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign sources of energy and hurt efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by preventing more cost-competitive, clean-burning natural gas from coming to markets.”
Dusty Horwitt (LAW ’02), a senior analyst at Earthworks, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group, suggested that the U.S. Forest Service’s change in position may be a result of the pressure from the oil and gas industry.
“The oil and gas industry, however, has a tremendous amount of power,” he said. “The drilling industry tends to be very aggressive in criticizing government officials and others who raise legitimate concerns about the safety of drilling.”
Wofford pointed out that forest plans are created specifically to fit the resources in a national forest and the surrounding communities.
“It’s perfectly consistent for the forest service to say, ‘We don’t think that fracking is a good fit with all the other values on the GW National Forest,’ but then also to allow gas drilling on other public lands in the country,” Wofford said.
Horwitt urged the service not to cede to the demands of the oil and gas industry.
“What’s at stake here is drinking water for more than 4 million people, and a spectacular place where more than a million people go for recreation every year,” he said.
State and local governments and officials have written numerous letters requesting the forest service to protect the water from possible contamination. The D.C. Water and Sewer Authority together with the Washington Aqueduct sent comments expressing their concerns about water contamination. The Washington Aqueduct, a subset of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, manages a portion of the water in D.C. and the Arlington and Falls Church regions of Virginia.
“As you consider finalizing the EIS [the U.S. Forest Service’s Draft Environmental Impact Statement], we urge you to remember the familiar saying: ‘an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,’” the Fairfax County Water Authority wrote in a letter to the forest service.
Local political figures have also urged the forest service to consider citizens’ concerns, including senators Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) and eight other members of Congress representing the region.
“When you’re talking about a place that’s as sensitive and important to drinking water supplies as the George Washington National Forest, it doesn’t make sense to allow an inherently risky process,” Horwitt said. “The forest service made the right recommendation in its draft plan, and they should stick with that plan when they make their final decision.”

After months of delays, Hoya Court construction has finished, and the food vendors should begin service later this week in a soft opening, featuring reduced hours and service prior to a grand opening Nov. 5.
“We had a few hiccups with getting our final permits for the health inspections — our last one is tomorrow,” Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Services Joelle Wiese said yesterday.
Hoya Court received its certificate of occupancy on Friday, which will allow vendors Subway, Elevation Burger and Salad Creations to apply for Department of Health inspections.
“On Thursday, we’re hoping that the divider will be down and the stores will be open for shortened hours,” Morey said.
The delays stemmed from problems within the city regulatory agencies but have not affected the grand opening date.
“The delay was really [the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs]; it was beyond our control. They just had delays pushing stuff through their system,” Chief Business Officer Deborah Morey said.
Despite the holdup with permits, the businesses have still been preparing for the opening.
“All of the employees are hired, they’ve been doing some training [and] we’ve been doing as much as we can,” Josetta Moore, district manager for Aramark, said. Aramark will operate the Hoya Court locations.
On Tuesday, temporary services in the Leavey Center, including Einstein Bros Bagels and Roasted, will cease and revert to pre-construction operations.
“The plan is that [Tuesday], after business, Einstein will go back to Regents Hall and Roasted will go away,” Wiese said. “Wednesday is kind of an influx day; we’ll be training and moving all the food in. We’ll be working with all those pieces for the soft opening.”
Roasted, currently operating in Hoya Court, will close, but it may be re-open in the future, as the administration has received positive feedback on the cart. Subway, which has been where Grab ‘n’ Go used to be, will move back to Hoya Court.
“None of Subway’s equipment is coming back. All of the Hoya Court equipment is brand new, so it’s the latest and greatest technology that Subway has,” Wiese said. “It’s just the staffing that’s moving. After Wednesday, the Subway employees will just start to work here.”
The Marketplace Express Grab ‘n’ Go, which is currently located on carts in the hallway, will move back across to its former location, where Subway is now.
The shortened hours will lengthen throughout the weekend, as the grand opening approaches.
Wiese said that they are looking at opening the storefronts from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
“It all depends on when we pass the department of health inspection, as soon as we get that passed, it will determine what happens on what date,” she said.
According to Wiese, concept training for most vendors has occurred off site, with the exception of Subway.
“We also have trainers from each of the brands who will be here — through the soft opening into the grand opening — on site with us to help the employees with anything they might need assistance with,” Moore said.
The grand opening Nov. 5 will take place at 10:30 a.m.
“The mascot will make an appearance, and there will be sampling,” Wiese said. “It will be a lot of fun. We don’t want to give it all away though.”

At the Georgetown University Medical Center, a group of students study medicine and health without the goal of becoming doctors.
The Mini-Medical School was born out of an effort to relieve student-neighbor tensions 18 years ago.
“There was a lot of unrest. The students were disruptive, and we wanted to show the local community that Georgetown has a place as an educational institution that has something to offer everybody,” Mini-Medical School Co-Director Herbert Herscowitz, a professor of microbiology and immunology, said. “It was really community outreach to appease them. It also gave us an opportunity to show off what we did to the community. The hospital was in a little bit of financial trouble at that time, and we thought if people saw what can be done at Georgetown, that might boost some business at the hospital as well.”
The course attempts to mimic a formal medical school curriculum by splitting the semester, which includes eight lectures, between the basic and clinical sciences, using the same material as the School of Medicine. Topics vary based on students’ requests, with this semester’s including anatomy, pharmacology, mind-body medicine, infectious diseases, psychiatry, dermatology, orthopedic surgery, obstetric care and genetics.
Each class is two hours long and generally contains a lecture with a question-and-answer session.
“For us, this is service,” Mini-Medical School Co-Director Carlos Suarez-Quian, a professor of biochemistry and cellular and molecular biology, said. “We don’t get compensated in any way, shape or form when we speak to the public. … When we ask faculty to do it, nobody ever says no to us, and nobody ever refuses to come back a second time.”
Students are also exposed to hands-on learning experiences, such as a session where current medical students present various cadavers. Upon completion of the program, participants receive a “Doctor of Mini-Medicine” certificate.
Five-time Mini-Medical student Chick Anderson emphasized the applicability of the information learned through the program.
“There was an advertisement in The Washington Post about three years ago that said, ‘Hey, do you ever wonder what those doctors are talking about?’” Anderson said. “At that time, my mother was having a lot of medical problems, so it seemed like it was designed especially for me.”
Participants in the course hail from an array of backgrounds, professions and ages, from retirees curious about health issues to high-school students attracted to the pre-med track.
“The first time I came, the first night, I was surprised. I was expecting to see about a hundred octogenarians, and there were a lot of young people, so I was very pleased to see the age spread, and I wondered whether most of these young people are actually studying to be doctors,” Mini-Medical student Anthony Turner said.
David Chin (COL ’12) was one of those students.
“I already knew a long time ago that I wanted to apply to medical school — this was just to keep myself active and just keep learning,” Chin said.
Thanks to the knowledge that Mini-Medical School provides, Anderson said that learning about the body and drugs in the program inspired him to stop taking many of his medications and to change his diet and exercise.
“I lost 20 pounds. My cholesterol went down. My blood pressure went down,” he said. “Last week, I went and told the professor, ‘You changed my life 18 months ago because of your class.’”
Two-time Mini-Medical student Sally Smith said that the program would help prepare her for future medical issues and communicate more effectively with her doctors.
“I have a better idea of what’s going on and questions that I can ask,” she said. “There’s a lot of practical knowledge, background knowledge that’s really important, I think, so if certain issues come up, at least you’ve got a little more background so that you can ask more appropriate questions.”
According to Suarez-Quian, the program’s popularity has only increased over the years, and the program has met its 200-person capacity each semester. Some students have attended at least one semester of each year for the past 10 years.
“What’s surprising to me is how dedicated some of these students that attend have been. In fact, we jokingly say, ‘Oh, we have our groupies,’” Suarez-Quian said.

D.C.’s Committee on Business, Consumer and Regulatory Affairs and the Committee on Finance and Revenue called for the passage of new minimum wage and sick leave legislature Monday.
The committee, co-chaired by D.C. Councilmembers Vincent Orange (D-Ward 5) and Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), convened for a panel-style event that attracted an audience of about 100.
“It’s time to come together, leave no one behind, give everybody the opportunity to not only be a part of one city, but also to be a part of one dream, one future,” Orange said.
Evans, who played an integral role in the last major minimum wage debate a decade ago, encouraged attendees to consider the effects of a minimum wage increase on both employee living conditions and business owners’ decisions to move their companies to or from D.C.
“The best approach, as I see it, would be if the federal government and Congress would move forward and raise the minimum wage nationwide,” Evans said, adding that gridlock in Congress has forced the issue to become a local one.
Orange said that an increase of the minimum wage beyond the current $8.25 an hour is essential to the success of low-income workers.
“Anyone who gets up every day and goes to work and works extremely hard should have the opportunity to have access to affordable housing, access to healthcare, to be able to ensure that their children get a good education, and it all starts with a good wage so [they] can pay their bills,” he said.
Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) said that it is important to keep promises to support the working poor, stating that D.C.’s minimum wage has not kept pace with the dramatic increase in living costs in the city in the past decade.
“As a government, I don’t think we’ve done all that we can to ensure that we are not building up a city where only the wealthy can live,” Grosso said.
Councilmember Jim Graham (D-Ward 1) expressed disappointment in Mayor Vincent Gray’s veto of the Large Retailer Accountability Act in September, which would have required large retailers to pay employees at least $12.50 an hour.
“We want people working, and we want to invest in people. But we want jobs that pay a living wage and that makes self-sufficiency economically viable at the end of all the supports and training programs,” he said. “So that’s my commitment today to work with my colleagues to ensure that we come out of this with something much better than the bill we rejected.”
D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute Executive Director Ed Lazere agreed that increased worker compensation and benefits would benefit workers without harming the economy.
“Some will argue that the District cannot make the changes we’re talking about today without putting our economy at risk, yet the bulk of the research on both the minimum wage and paid sick leave suggests that we can in fact help D.C. workers without harming D.C.’s economy,” he said.

A month after its usual hiring season, The Corp posted a call for two new Midnight MUG employees last Wednesday.
Though mid-semester hiring is uncommon, Midnight MUG required more manpower than expected due to non-work-related employee injuries and increased demand. The application will remain open until 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. Students of Georgetown, Inc. Director of Human Resources Deanna Arthur (SFS ’14) said that the number of applicants was not available because the application was still live.
“A few of our employees have had injuries mid-semester that make it really difficult for them to work a full shift load at Midnight, and this situation pushed us to need a few more hands on deck,” Corp CEO Lizzy MacGill (COL ’14) said.
These non-work-related injuries have increased the workload on the 84 staff members of Midnight MUG, according to Midnight MUG Director Elise Mixon (COL ’15).
“While I have been extremely impressed with the amount of Midnight MUG employees who have stepped up to help out their fellow employees, the fact remains, however, that we are all still full-time students, and working that much all the time is not sustainable, nor enjoyable,” Mixon said.
The need for an expanded workforce has been reinforced by the high demand for Midnight MUG services.
“Midnight MUG is always a particularly busy store,” Arthur said. “We are more so hiring to make sure that none of Midnight MUG’s shifts are understaffed with the holes that have opened up this semester.”
The two new hires are expected to decrease the workload on the coffee shop’s employees during the especially busy finals season.
“With our current number of employees we wouldn’t be able to adequately serve our fellow students during that time of need,” Arthur said.
Despite the unusual timing of this application, the hiring process – which generally leads to the acceptance of less than 10 percent of applicants each semester – will remain the same, adjusted to a quicker timeline.
Midnight MUG will have the same standards for new hires that it does during the normal hiring season, according to Mixon.
“We are looking for the same type of employee we always hire: someone who is hardworking, engaged with the Georgetown community and interested in serving their peers,” Mixon said.

The Georgetown University Student Association is forming a Socioeconomic Working Group, which GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) promised to do during their election campaign in March.
The committee, led by GUSA Secretary of Social Justice Brittney Blakely (COL ’14), is aiming to develop a comprehensive report on the effects of socioeconomic status at Georgetown, similar to the LGBTQ Safety and Security Report created by the last GUSA administration.
“We want to get a group together just to assess the situation because we don’t know everything there is to know,” Tisa said. “It’s something that GUSA has a responsibility and an ability to investigate and use that investigation, use that information that we come out with to make change.”
Potential goals of the committee include better utilizing services already offered to students from low-income families and holding finance advisory sessions at the beginning of each semester. The executives, however, acknowledged that the immediate effects the committee could have on campus life are limited.
“I cannot necessarily change a professor ordering a book that he deems necessary for a class,” Ramadan said. “So I guess we’re already starting to do what I want to see come out of this committee, which is just the awareness on campus.”
For Tisa, Ramadan and Blakely, socioeconomic status is a personal issue, as it is for many students on campus. Tisa is a financial aid recipient, while Ramadan is a member of the Georgetown Scholarship Program and Blakely has worked three jobs since arriving at Georgetown.
“I think in both of our cases, it didn’t limit what we were able to do, but we were certainly conscious of it,” Tisa said of himself and Ramadan. “We certainly saw how, for many students, it’s a big issue. We saw how it can certainly impact the Georgetown experience.”
The committee stemmed from the sentiment that socioeconomic status was often ignored in campus discussions.
“When we talk about diversity at Georgetown, oftentimes it’s diversity of thought or diversity of culture, but socioeconomic diversity also falls into that,” Ramadan said. “Sometimes it gets overlooked.”
Blakely agreed that socioeconomic disparity affects many at Georgetown.
“It’s personal, but it also applies to so many students here,” Blakely said. “There’s a large group of students now who do not have a certain socioeconomic status, and that does present problems.”
She hopes the committee will start a conversation on campus.
“[Socioeconomic status] does impact social life, academic life, personal functioning. [It] affects all of it,” Blakely said. “We just want to begin the dialogue.”
