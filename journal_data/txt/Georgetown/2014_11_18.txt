The university released guidelines for campus protests and tabling in an update to the Speech and Expression Policy sent in a campus-wide email yesterday.
The new guidelines for campus protests specify areas of campus in which groups should protest, depending on where an event is held. Students are instructed to protest in the southwest corner of Copley Lawn when events are held in Gaston Hall and in Red Square when events are held in Copley Formal Lounge or the Intercultural Center Auditorium.
These updates were released about two-and-a-half weeks after Hoyas United for Free Speech, a coalition of students advocating for free speech reform on campus, delivered a petition to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson.
The petition garnered about 460 signatures and called for the expansion of free speech zones on campus, the expansion of accessibility for disabled students and the diversification of views presented in class curriculum.
“While HUFS appreciates the changes that the university made in updating the Speech and Expression Policy, we still have several concerns with how the policy now stands,” HUFS founder Vincent DeLaurentis (SFS ’17) wrote in an email.
Specifically, DeLaurentis said that the university should provide training to the university community about the changes to the policy and that the policy must be carried out correctly.
“More so, the release of a new policy does not signal the end of student concern around speech,” DeLaurentis wrote. “HUFS and individual students remain concerned about the protection of free speech and expression on campus and will keep a vigilant eye on university actions related to speech.”
Olson said the updates represent a continuation of ongoing modifications to the Speech and Expression Policy, and minimal substantive change.
“This email was not actually a new policy change — it was the announcement that provided final details on implementation of the changes that we worked through over the past year,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The university-wide email from Olson noted that “public squares” where students are allowed to table include Regents Lawn, Library Walk and the Healey Family Student Center. Groups are also now permitted to table in residential areas such as the Alumni Square courtyard and the patio at the base of steps between Henle Village and Darnall Hall, so long as the groups do not become disruptive to residents.
Additionally, Olson’s email stated that the Speech and Expression Committee will issue opinions based on complaints about possible violations of the Speech and Expression Policy so that they can be used as a reference for future complaints.
“I think the most notable change here is that the updates provide greater clarity on key issues of student concern — including expanding tabling locations, policies on student media and a clearer system for students to bring complaints about issues related to speech and expression,” Olson wrote in his email to The Hoya.
Olson’s email included a link to a map that details exactly where groups are allowed to table, which GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) helped to develop. Tezel and Jikaria have worked with the university since the spring to create the map.
“We now have a specific tabling map that we have been pushing for a while, that will lay out clearly to student groups where they can lay out tables and where they can’t,” Tezel said. “We are encouraged by the decision the committee made … and this is now the groundwork for a new culture around speech and expression at Georgetown, though the work is by no means done and we’ll need to stay vigilant.”
H*yas for Choice President Abby Grace (SFS ’16) said that while she is happy with the ways that the policy updates accommodate unrecognized student groups, she would like the university to allow tabling on the sidewalk in front of Healy Hall, among other further measures.
H*yas for Choice was removed from Healy Circle by the Georgetown University Police Department last January when they tabled outside of the Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life.
While students are allowed to demonstrate in other ways in that area, they are not allowed to place tables in Healy Circle.
“[The university] always uses the justification that you can sit there without the table and it would be just fine, but for us, what’s important is that the tabling is what we do every day,” Grace said. “Most of the time, when we’re trying to make our presence known at these events, we’re trying to make a statement by participating in the same action that we participate in on a daily basis.”

Unrecognized student groups will now have some access to previously restricted benefits, such as co-hosting events with recognized groups and reserving campus space, after the creation of a GUSA apparatus to provide benefits announced yesterday.
Groups like H*yas for Choice, which have not been able to access the benefits available to recognized clubs because of lack of university recognition, will now be able to access benefits through a GUSA partnership. Unrecognized groups will be able to use storage space, reserve classrooms and use printing services through the GUSA executive, rather than through direct connection to university services and offices, like recognized student groups.
These groups will still lack university funding and will not be able to use the university logo, both of which are benefits delegated to recognized student groups.
The changes were not addressed in a campus-wide email sent by Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) announcing changes to the Speech and Expression Policy on Monday, but were announced via a GUSA press release championing the change for unrecognized groups.
Since the ability to access these benefits stems from a GUSA apparatus, the change did not require any university policy modifications.
The university gave storage space on the mezzanine level of Regents Hall to GUSA, which will delegate it to non-recognized student groups, pending approval from the GUSA Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee.
“That is pending approval, but we’re pretty confident that it will pass. This combination of new benefits for students will really help benefit free speech on campus,” Tezel said.
H*yas for Choice President Abby Grace (SFS ’16) said that she is excited about the new storage space that will be available to clubs without access to benefits.
“That’s something we’ve definitely talked about working toward. We’ve sat down and had extensive meetings with them on pretty much what it means what are the barriers we see we’re working with,” Grace said. “And to be completely frank with you, I have like 2,000 condoms in my living room right now.”
While most of the access to benefits changes are through a GUSA initiative, the updated university Speech and Expression Policy has also changed to allow recognized student groups to co-sponsor events with any other group, regardless of its access-to-benefits status.
These co-sponsorships will still have to follow the guidelines for co-sponsorship outlined by the Center for Student Engagement.
Grace said that this policy change will make event sponsorship easier for H*yas for Choice and other unrecognized groups.
“That’s definitely one of our biggest problems when coordinating other groups on campus that might have similar interests on specific events, making sure that they’re not facing any backlash from the administration for working with us,” Grace said.

It’s a shame one abortionist student group commands so much attention around here.

Agree with “Concerned student” about the outsized amount of attention paid to Hoyas for Choice. For me, though, it’s not the fact that they’re a pro-choice group that’s frustrating, but rather that the amount of ink spilled about them in The Hoya significantly exaggerates their influence and footprint on campus. (Note: This is no criticism of HFC; if anything, kudos to their Comms Department.)
The coverage of this benefit extension is a perfect example of HFC-centric coverage — there are a lot more groups than HFC that benefit from this extension of benefits, yet they receive barely a passing mention. The failure to speak to a single fraternity or sorority representative for this article, for instance — groups that, in total, have a hundreds of *active* members on campus (as opposed to just a large email distribution list) — is a failure by The Hoya to adequately convey the impact this change will have on the campus community.
It’s possible The Hoya was in a hurry to turn this story around and didn’t have time to reach out to many other groups. If so, I hope they’ll use the coming days to do their due diligence and give this announcement the treatment it deserves in Friday’s edition.

Following widespread student concerns about the treatment of resident assistants and enforcement of the confidentiality policies all RAs must sign governing their interactions with residents, the university has yet to offer clarification or propose changes, prompting the Georgetown University Student Association to unanimously pass a bill Sunday calling for the administration to investigate all claims of RA mistreatment.
A viewpoint by RA Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) published in The Hoya last week that detailed the university’s failure to provide him with support following his involvement with former student Daniel Milzman’s ricin case last year — by limiting the options for counseling available to him as an RA subject to confidentiality policy, among other actions — prompted other RAs to share their concerns regarding haphazard approaches to classifying RAs as university employees and limits on RAs’ ability to seek counseling and report instances of sexual assault involving residents.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson did not provide details on the confidentiality agreement that all RAs sign.
Amid confusion surrounding the confidentiality policies signed by RAs, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson was not able to give any details on the definitions and boundaries of confidentiality, when confidentiality does and does not take effect or when the university would finish discussions surrounding this issue and develop a clearer definition of the policy.
He said, however, that the university is committed to fostering open dialogue with RAs and to looking into these issues, and that Lloyd will not be fired for sharing his experiences, as some RAs had speculated. He did not specify whether or not Lloyd’s piece was a breach of confidentiality or why, as compared to past enforcement of the RA confidentiality policy.
“We work to make responsible judgments and we certainly are looking at and asking ourselves are there ways to provide more clarity to RAs as we go forward,” Olson said in a conference call with Georgetown University Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh.
Olson, Assistant Dean of Residential Life Stephanie Lynch, and Residential Education Director Ed Gilhool sent out a joint email Friday evening to all RAs describing the appropriate support options for RAs. Olson said that this email served as a message to convey that the university is willing to listen to the RAs and to remind them of the university’s pre-existing policies, not to introduce new policy revisions.
“I would actually say that this message was more of re-emphasizing the commitments that were there, and acknowledging that for some students there were certainly concerns that have been raised, but I characterize it more as a good reminder and an emphasis than a brand new set of policies or approaches,” Olson said.
In an interview, Lloyd stressed the need for a clearer definition of the RA confidentiality policy.
“Ambiguities in the roles of RAs on campus allow for potential exploitation of that role, if something were to happen in a confidential situation,” Lloyd said.
In an email sent to all RAs, Title IX Coordinator Rosemary Kilkenny and Deputy Title IX Coordinator for Undergraduates Jeanne Lord on Saturday night clarified that reporting a sexual assault would not affect RA employment.
“We want to be clear that reporting that you or someone you know has been involved in an incident involving sexual misconduct does not have any effect on your role as an RA,” Kilkenny and Lord wrote in the email.
Several RAs raised concerns about knowing when they are acting as an RA or when they are off duty.
Olson declined to comment on any details about this distinction, but said the university is working to more clearly define what he described as a “gray area.”
“I would say there are some situations that are very clear. When an RA is on-duty in their buildings and they’re interacting as part of their duty rotations, that’s pretty clear. There are some other situation where RAs are on campus that’s not as clear, and that’s what we’re working through, is those, maybe more gray areas,” Olson said.
The GUSA bill urges the administration to address these issues.
“If you’re an RA and you’re wondering right now… ‘Am I going to sign a contract, what are my rights, what am I guaranteed? Will I have legal protection? What if I’m assaulted?’ Things need to be spelled out,” GUSA senate Speaker Tyler Bridge (COL ’17) said. “Students at Georgetown should not have to have a law degree to become an RA and not know exactly what they’re getting when they sign that form.”
Chairperson of the GUSA Intellectual Life Committee Elizabeth Oh (SFS ’16) led the drafting of the bill, which GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) signed Monday night, and said that she hopes it will force the administration to make substantive changes to its policies.
“The senate passed this bill to hold the administration accountable for investigating the mishandling of some of the past cases, and also encourage them to continuously and cooperatively work with RAs so that they are safe and supported throughout their employment,” Oh wrote in an email.

The entire dorm replacing the old Jesuit residence in Ryan and Mulledy Halls will be a Living Learning Community dedicated to the “spirit of Georgetown,” requiring applications from all 148 residents.
Set to open in fall 2015, the LLC, which has been named the Spirit of Georgetown Residential Academy, will house 148 students selected by the Office of Residential Living. The students will be required to participate in monthly conversations with other residents, host community-wide events and complete an ePortfolio detailing their contributions to the university.
Because of the buildings’ ties to the Jesuit community and its central campus location opening onto Dahlgren Quad, administrators and others involved in the planning process decided to dedicate the whole dorm to an LLC, rather than only a portion of the residence. The community will be the only LLC to encompass an entire dorm, and will be the largest LLC.
The Spirit of Georgetown Residential Academy will join LLCs in living well, Jewish life, French language and culture, culture and performance, justice and diversity in action, global living and Muslim interest.
Applications will be made available in the beginning of December, and Director of Residential Education Ed Gilhool said he expects a large pool.
The nine tenets on which the LLC will focus on will include Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam (For the Greater Glory of God), Contemplatives in Action, Academic Excellence, Educating the Whole Person, Cura Personalis, Faith & Justice, Women & Men for Others, Interreligious Understanding, and Community in Diversity.
“Given the rich history and location of the buildings, the planning dents,” Gilhool wrote in an email. “Inspired by the ‘Residential College’ models seen on campuses such as Stanford and Cornell, the Residential Academy will offer students a unique and focused living experience that will allow them to explore in depth their Georgetown education.”
According to Catholic Chaplain Fr. Gregory Schenden, S.J., a member of the planning committee, the Residential Academy will further the real-life application of Jesuit values on campus.
“What will make this residence unique (even in terms of Living and Learning Communities) is that the ‘philosophy’ of the residence will be built upon the nine tenets of the Spirit of Georgetown,” Schenden wrote in an email. “The desire is that these tenets, while very much at work in all facets of Georgetown life already, will be experienced or lived in a more explicit, intentional and mindful way in this new residence. I feel that this will garner interest in terms of applying to live in the residence.”
Schenden said that the Residential Academy will make a powerful historical connection to the Jesuits who previously resided in Ryan and Mulledy Halls.
“That a new residence is being created and based explicitly and mindfully upon the Spirit of Georgetown tenets, which are rooted in our greater Ignatian or Jesuit tradition in the buildings that have historically been home to the Jesuits here at Georgetown, makes for a powerful historical connection,” Schenden wrote. “It is wonderful that the buildings will once again be used residentially and devoted to the tenets of our Ignatian or Jesuit heritage.”
Mary Petrone (COL ’15), a residential assistant representative on the planning committee, said that the Residential Academy will be unique in creating a cohesive community by encompassing a whole residential building.
“Unlike other Living and Learning Communities that are going to take a floor of the building, this will be the entire building. The vision is for it to be one cohesive community,” Petrone said.
Petrone said that buildings’ ties with Georgetown’s Jesuit values deserved preservation.
“The buildings that are remodeled right now, the former Jesuit Residence, are very old and are very significant on our Georgetown campus because of their nature, their ties with the Jesuit tradition here,” Petrone said. “And also the location of the buildings open out to Dahlgren Quad, which is a very sacred space. We want it to preserve that. We want to be mindful of that history and tradition in modern-day campus. We want to do something that is different and make the building a threshold that ties into the spiritual aspect of the campus.”
The former Jesuit Residence will feature semi-suites and apartments with two, four, six, eight and nine-person units. Some of the rooms will have lofts and balconies facing the Potomac River.
Petrone said that this renovation will appeal to students looking for new housing arrangements.
“The building is going to offer new style of living that is not offered by other residence halls on campus, so that’s going to have a big appeal,” Petrone said. “That’s the purpose of shaping new building structure, to make it more appealing to students.”
Petrone said that while the Residential Academy appeals to students religious in the Catholic faith, it will be inclusive to all students, regardless of their religion.
“I think it would initially attract students that are more religious in the Catholic faith,” Petrone said. “I hope it would advent to be more inclusive to the student body because even if you are not particularly religious, the Jesuit values and reflecting college traditions are just something that is very important for all college kids. I hope that everyone can find value in it.”
Regardless, some students said that an LLC focusing on Jesuit values would not be appealing to them because of its religious connections.
“I think it would be really interesting to live in the Jesuit residence,” Emily Lau (NHS ’17) said. “But I guess if they change it into a living and learning community for Jesuit values, I’m not sure if I would apply because I am not very religious.”
 
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that applications for the Spirit of Georgetown LLC are due in early December. Applications will, in fact, be made available in early December.

I would want to live there if I were at GU now. Congrats to GU for the vision to make this LLC happen. It’s going to be a great place!!

The fourth annual TEDxGeorgetown event entitled “Ithaca: The Road Less Traveled,” focused on stories about journeys, drawing around 500 attendees on Saturday.
Talks from students, faculty members, staff members and individuals from outside of the university community were separated into three sessions, titled “Formation,” “Trials” and “Coda,” with breakout groups including individual speakers following each session, a new addition.
Conference Chair Cheryl Lau (SFS ’16) said these additions made the event more interactive than in previous years. She added the breakout sessions improved the overall experience of the event.
“We wanted people to talk to the speakers, get to know them on a human level, and really think about all these ideas rattling around in their head,” Lau said.
University President John J. DeGioia opened the event, setting a tone of self-discovery with a purpose that was woven throughout the conference.
“What is formation? This is the process through which we discover a most authentic self, a self that only we are called to be,” DeGioia said.
The first speaker, Center for Social Justice Executive Director Andria Wisler, shared her story of personal formation teaching at a school for at-risk girls, emphasizing that while she may have told her story alone on stage, formation cannot happen alone. She also encouraged students not to delay service and social justice until after college.
“This denial of the college years as the real world, sarcastically or seriously stated, acutely diminishes the hope for any personal transformation, as well as transformation of our communities, starting with our shared communities here on the Hilltop,” Wisler said. “College is not a time separate from some larger, bigger, better life. Believe me, this is the real world.”
Vice Provost for Education Randall Bass spoke about redesigning the university to include high-impact formal learning and experiential co-curricular learning.
“It’s already starting that for the first time now in maybe a thousand years, the university no longer has a monopoly on learning and certification,” Bass said.
Davis Performing Arts Center Artistic Director Derek Goldman framed his discussion of theater in a global context by a performance of his own.
Goldman described the importance of theater in areas of limited free speech, such as Belarus, Poland and Sudan, and detailed the interdisciplinary work of the Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics and his courses at Georgetown.
“The things that make me believe in Georgetown and the things that make me believe in theater are profoundly linked: belief in the power of looking inward and outward at the same time, the importance of listening and attending, cultivating one’s own voice, pursuing the common good,” Goldman said. “In its essential nature, theater is all about process not product.”
Former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and current opposition leader Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim detailed his experience with police brutality and unfair detention as a political dissident in Malaysia and his return despite the threat of re-imprisonment.
“I think the cause for democracy, for freedom, for justice, is not a theoretical principle,” Ibrahim said. “It is an issue of conviction, an issue of courage of conviction, of felicity of purpose. It is faith and values. It is ethics. It is a principle that you cannot compromise with.”
Josephine Moore (SFS ’16) addressed eating disorders as addictions in her speech, drawing from her personal experiences. She emphasized that eating disorders are addictions with psychological foundations, and not just body image issues. Moore encouraged those suffering from eating disorders to seek help from friends and loved ones, and urged the Georgetown community to break the silence surrounding the issue.
“Eating disorders are coping mechanisms, your way to deal with your problems when everything in your life seems out of control and unmanageable,” Moore said.
Alisha “M’Jestie” Brooks, songwriter and founder of Dream City University, told her story of becoming a songwriter as a teenage mother. After achieving success writing for Rihanna and Victoria Beckham, however, Brooks wanted to expand her work to realizing the dreams of others.
“My dream was to have the attention of the world. I had that and all I said was ‘Turn the music up.’ That’s pretty sad, right? I wanted something different,” Brooks said.
Brooks founded Dream Little Dreamer, now known as Dream City University, a company that educates young people about how to break into the entertainment industry.
BANGS Shoes Founder and CEO Hannah Davis spoke about her success founding a shoe company that reinvests in small business development with partner Kiva International.
“When you help somebody start a business, you’re not only removing dependence on a third-party organization, you’re boosting local economies, and I think that the most important part about helping someone start a business is you are instilling the power of change and the power of development within their own selves,” Davis said.
GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) closed out the second session with his story of LBGTQ advocacy, an answer to the question that titled his presentation, “Why Am I So Gay?”
“For me it comes down to three things,” Lloyd said. “One is my obligations to history. Two are the realities of my own identity. And lastly are obligations for those yet to come.”
Lloyd described his struggle to accept himself and discussed building off of the experiences of those who came before and working for the futures of others at his high school and at Georgetown, despite its checkered history toward LGBTQ students.
“Part of Georgetown owning its history and owning its identity means now that other institutions, our peer Jesuit and Catholic institutions, and any other faith-based institution cannot say that they have this irreconcilable difference with their LGBTQ students,” Lloyd said. “Georgetown is more Catholic today because there are fewer hate crimes.”
The event closed with a session emphasizing forward motion.
Adan Gonzalez (COL ’15), a first-generation Latino college student from a low-income background spoke of his challenges and the work yet to be done in expanding opportunity in the United States. He founded the Sí Se Puede Network and has worked with over 100,000 students and parents to provide resources for education.
“Live to serve for a greater good. What does that mean? Our communities do not need a superman. We need each other to help discover our own powers,” Gonzalez said.
At the end of his talk, Gonzalez brought his father, who had never before been able to travel to see his son at Georgetown, onstage to a standing ovation.
Omékongo Dibinga, a spoken word poet, activist and educator, gave another less conventional talk. He opened and closed with spoken word poems involving audience participation.
Dibinga’s background from a low-income Congolese family inspired him to start his organization, UPstander International.
“My organization is called UPstander International because I’m part of a community that takes a stand when we hear about these issues,” Dibinga said. “And so with my work, we speak to people. Maybe not a lot of people are listening, but we never stop. Many of us got this education and don’t know a lot about what’s happening outside of these doors. But you’re directly connected to a world community.”
Sheryll Cashin, professor of law at  the Georgetown Law Center and author of “Place Not Race: A New Vision of Opportunity in America,” gave a talk paraphrasing a letter to her two sons from her book, touching on perseverance, family legacy and race.
“One day, you will cease being adorable in the eyes of other people,” Cashin said. “And all I can do is prepare you for that. Before your first facial hairs emerge, you will notice that some people are afraid of you. I take heart in the fact that your generation will be better. … But you won’t realize your potential if you don’t consciously try to build multiracial coalitions for the common good.”
The event ended with Christoper Wadibia’s (COL ’16) talk on faith. As the first student from his high school to attend an elite university, Wadibia presented his idea of church nationalism, faith outside of the context of culture-based organized religion.
“Church nationalism promotes the idea that it’s not about titles and affiliations. It’s about the sincerity of your existence,” Wadibia said. “It’s about the disposition of your heart, your relation to God, the curiosity that is within your heart and your hunger to understand the divine in some capacity. Church nationalism is also about the idea of your outward behavior matching your inward passion, your inward joy.”

A day before the Veterans Day Concert of Valor held on the National Mall honored those who served, the District of Columbia, behind Mayor Vincent Gray, broke ground on D.C.’s first permanent supportive housing to address veteran homelessness in D.C.
Located at 1005 North Capitol St. NE, the John and Jill Ker Conway Residence is set to be completed by December 2015.
Gray released the Service Members, Veterans and Their Families Action Plan last week to advance progress toward the goal. There are currently 499 homeless veterans on the streets of D.C., according to the Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
This new initiative incorporates the development of a new mixed income housing apartment building, which will include supportive housing for homeless veterans. The action plan will promote a new system that prioritizes the most vulnerable veterans, using a housing placement system in coordination with veterans’ outreach initiatives to place these veterans in housing services.
VA Medical Center Homeless Coordinator Kevin Morton explained that the organizations involved developed a vulnerability index to assess the relative need of individual veterans.
“We develop tools to assess everyone in the community and we have one resource list that all the partners in the community pull from to help house veterans … We are able to identify veterans who are most vulnerable and have been homeless the longest and we use that tool to house the correct people,” Morton said. “We use vouchers that we get from the [Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing] program to house veterans that are currently homeless, who are most vulnerable.”
The District has recently seen a drop in veteran homelessness. According to data collected by the D.C. Department of Housing and Urban Development in January 2014, veteran homelessness rates have seen a 33-point drop, or a decrease by 24,837 people, since 2010.
Pathways to Housing CEO Christy Respress credits the District’s success to the inclusion of more community partners via the Veterans NOW campaign, targeting veterans who previously did not feel comfortable interacting with the VA to access more services.
“The VA have done things they haven’t before such as including community partners because they don’t have the ability to house every veteran on their own, so including community partners to complement the resources they have,” Respress said. “We all have this shared commitment and vision to ending homelessness for veterans. … It’s forced us to get creative in a way that’s been really powerful and has had dramatic success.”
Hoya/Homeless Outreach Programs & Education President Chantelle Johnson (MSB ’16) was impressed with the recent introduction of 200 new beds for homeless veterans in D.C. and its future prospects.
“If we only have 500 homeless veterans in D.C, I definitely think it shouldn’t be that hard for us to provide housing for 300 more,” Johnson said.
Morton noted that this problem still prevails in the District, however, with the high housing costs in the area.
“Housing is so expensive in D.C.,” Morton said. “A lot of veterans also have mental health issues and substance abuse issues.”
Johnson noted that homelessness is particularly devastating to veterans.
“I’ve come to realize that being homeless is degrading to veterans not only because of them not having a place to come home but the fact of them knowing they put their lives on the line to protect our country and not having a place to go after the fact,” Johnson said.
Despite the improvements in veterans administration, Johnson urged the VA to develop better communications with veterans.
“I just feel like [the VA] should do a better job at first reaching out, because some people don’t go to the VA and don’t know what’s available, and then, second, making sure resources are actually available,” she said.
On top of governmental oversight, Respress also emphasized the importance of individuals showing their support to the D.C. council for ending veteran homelessness, both in D.C. and in their own hometowns.
“What’s really important for us is that if people are interested in getting involved, they should let their policymakers know this is an issue that means something to them because with that kind of advocacy we really will reach our goal of ending veteran homelessness,” she said.
Johnson also emphasized the necessity of community support in ending veteran homelessness.
“If you go to the VA … a big thing they say is that they need community help and support, so I think programs, such as HOPE and other things the CSJ has going on, are very crucial,” she said. “The VA can’t accommodate everyone due to funding issues … [so] it has to be community effort to get veterans off the street.”

The Office of the College Dean has instructed department heads to delete courses that do not meet an eight-student enrollment minimum during pre-registration in order to minimize costs and inefficiency, denying students the chance to add these classes to their schedules during the add-drop period at the beginning of the semester.
This guideline was implemented in an email sent to department chairs in August.
Several faculty members objected to the policy, resulting in the appointment of a committee to propose changes to the dean.
“We’re still trying to manage our resources, but we’re doing it at the planning stage, not at the last-minute stage in terms of cancellation,” College Senior Associate Dean of Faculty and Strategic Planning Jeff Connor-Linton said. “Often, policies evolve, and we’re trying to find the right balance. It was not workable. It was not the right way to go.”
Department heads have been asked to plan course offerings according to enrollment data from previous years, in order to meet the eight-student minimum.
“What we’ve asked department chairs to do for this spring is to look at enrollment data from the last several years, and if a course that they planned to offer had had enrollments under eight, to let us know why that was necessary and why they thought it would have more enrollment this time,” Connor-Linton said.
Connor-Linton added that many courses are exempt from cancellation, such as courses that fulfill general education requirements, major requirements and upper-level language courses.
“Half of the curriculum is protected from low enrollment issues anyway. Another 40 percent of courses are protected by the fact that they never have under-enrollments,” he said. “Last year, a total of 5 percent of college courses had an enrolment under six students. It’s a very small slice anyway.”
According to the US News & World Report, 60 percent of classes in Georgetown have fewer than 20 students, with only 7 percent of classes including over 50 students.
Connor-Linton said that he predicts that most of the courses that will be affected by the policy will be electives. The policy will result in classes that do not meet the eight-student minimum being offered less frequently.
“What we’re trying to do is make sure that the same small enrollment courses are not offered too frequently,” Connor-Linton said. “If you have a small enrollment course, that’s OK, but maybe offer it every third or fourth semester, so that demand builds up.”
Both Connor-Linton and Pierce foresee little impact on students’ course selections during pre-registration. Courses would be deleted after pre-registration but before the start of the add-drop period.
“If a class does have to be cancelled, it’ll happen between [pre-registration and add-drop], so when students hear about their courses, in the unlikely case that their first choice is cancelled, they’ll still get their alternate course,” Connor-Linton said.
According to the University Registrar and Assistant Provost John Q. Pierce, the enrollment minimum would have no impact on the add-drop process.
“The policy is aimed at determining which courses will be offered. I don’t expect that any noticeable impact will occur in add-drop,” Pierce said. “The thinking of the dean is that students would be better served by having the faculty member teach a course that would attract more student interest rather than a course that has never achieved much enrollment.”
Connor-Linton said that the policy would benefit both faculty members and students.
“There are pedagogical benefits for a small course. A lot of us feel that 12 is the minimum we really want in a class. If I only have six, there are a lot of things I can’t do,” Connor-Linton said. “It’s also an issue of fairness among the distribution of teaching load among faculty. If you’re teaching four really small courses, you’re not carrying the same load as somebody else.”
Davis Wong (COL ’18) said that the enrollment minimum is a further threat to electives in the College.
“I feel like at a school like Georgetown, we don’t have enough of an emphasis on electives. It’s easy to fall into a typical academic route, so I support anything that allows people to flesh themselves out more,” Wong said. “Besides, I would definitely enjoy being in smaller-sized classes.”

Small classes are the best! Don’t cancel me!

What does this mean for small departments, like Music, which often have upper-level courses with fewer than five students in the class?  Will we be left with a grand total of five or so classes, most of which will be intro level courses we’ve already taken, from which to choose?  Doesn’t sound good…

Why would you interview someone from the Class of 2018 on their views about electives? Why are they qualified to talk about anything academically related, considering they haven’t even finished their first semester of college?

GU Fossil Free successfully scheduled a meeting with University President John J. DeGioia to discuss divestment options for the university after a  meeting with DeGioia’s Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara (GRD ’96) Thursday and a rally Friday.
At the meeting with Ferrara, GU Fossil Free demanded to meet with the DeGioia within the next week in order to have its proposal put forward to the university’s board of directors during their February 2015 meeting.
Although Ferrara was unable to schedule a meeting with DeGioia by next week since DeGioia will be in Tokyo for most of the week, he was able to secure a meeting for GU Fossil Free for Nov. 25.
Despite Ferrara’s agreement, GU Fossil Free followed through with a rally in Red Square and a march to DeGioia’s office in Healy Hall on Friday, demanding to meet with DeGioia. At the office, the students were again greeted by Ferrara who informed them that DeGioia was not on campus at that time.
Around 20 students attended the rally, including those from other campus groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine and Hoyas United for Free Speech. The students carried signs that said “Say Yes To Divest” and“1,700 Hoyas for Divestment.”
The group requested photographic proof that they had indeed stormed the office. DeGioia’s secretary obliged, and snapped a panoramic photo of the protesters and their signage.
During Thursday’s meeting with Ferrara, GU Fossil Free member Patricia Cipollitti (SFS ’15) expressed her frustration with the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility’s decision to not meet again until next semester, therefore delaying the process. She added that this contributes to GU Fossil Free’s need to speak with DeGioia.
“It’s clear that [CISR] won’t vote on it in time, so we wanted to speak to the president to convince him of the urgency of this issue and why time is of the essence for us to get on the board of directors meeting in February because we think that the CISR is unresponsive to that urgency,” Cipollitti said.
GU Fossil Free member Theo Montgomery (SFS ’17) said divestment would benefit the endowment.
“We do think that it will actually give us more [money] than traditional oil and coal investments in the future,” Montgomery said. “We think that it will actually perform better.”
Once the group reached the office, Ferrara passed on a letter that DeGioia addressed to GU Fossil Free, lauding the group’s efforts and agreeing to meet with them.
“I will be working with my colleagues on the days ahead to determine the most efficient and appropriate way to bring this matter before our board of directors,” DeGioia wrote.
Ferrara emphasized DeGioia’s intentions of cooperating with GU Fossil Free in future meetings.
“He definitely wants to meet with you. He wants to have a conversation. He wants to talk about the best and most appropriate way to get [the proposal] in front of the board of directors,” Ferrara told GU Fossil Free members.
GU Fossil Free member Mandy Lee (SFS ’17) said she felt GU Fossil Free was at a tipping point for completing its objectives, and that divestment would be a political statement for the university.
“Divestment essentially is withdrawing our investments in the top 200 fossil fuel companies,” Lee said. “What it would do is express our commitment to social responsibility in a really important way. … In a way our investments in these companies are very small. We’re a drop in the bucket, but what this does is make a huge political statement.”
Cippolliti said that she counted the day as a win for divestment and expected future success.
“I think it went well and that we made the right decision to continue on with the action because the administration responded to our requests after we had met with them but they did so because we expressed to them there was going to be a demonstration,” Cipolliti said.

Humor me, but how many involved in this campaign are in the business school or have taken a finance class?

The School of Foreign Service will offer a one-credit, pass-fail course next semester that will grant academic credit to SFS students who hold internships.
This course, which is aimed toward juniors and seniors but will also be open to sophomores, will be taught by Associate Dean Emily Zenick.
“The class is intended to provide an academic framework to support students in setting goals for their internship and in reflecting upon the experience as it relates to their academic and career goals,” the course description states.
Similar courses stressing the connection between internships and academics already exist in the McDonough School of Business and the College.
“The SFS decided at the end of the summer that we needed to come up with our own class,” Zenick said. “The [MSB] and the College have similar classes, and we wanted to articulate the connection between work done during an internship and a student’s academics and major.”
The class will be based on Blackboard and will be capped at a size of 20 students. Qualified students must work in an internship for a minimum total of 75 hours during the academic term in which the course is offered.
Total class time will add up to about five hours a week of supplemental work, group reflection discussions and meetings with the course convener. Additionally, students will be assigned 20 to 25 pages of reading a week, complete consistent blog posts and assignments and choose a book to read in its entirety throughout the course.
“[The course will] bring individual students’ reflection and an integration of experiences to get them to think strategically about how their internship was related to the major they studied in addition to classes and long-term research,” Zenick said.
SFS Academic Council President Megan Murday (SFS ’15) helped develop the program and worked closely with the deans’ office in charge.
“It’s a fantastic program,” Murday said. “It directly addresses the need of students to tie professional experiences to academic experiences.”
Murday and Zenick both emphasized the importance of the course for some international students who, dependent on visa status, need academic credit from their school to participate in certain internships.
Additionally, they highlighted the importance of Georgetown providing support for students who choose to do internships while they are enrolled in the university and how imperative it is for students to have as complete an internship experience as is possible.
“The one-credit course is a much-needed option for SFS students,” SFS Academic Council Senior Representative Annie Kennelly (SFS ’15) wrote in an email, “Not only does it encourage students to gain experience in the professional world, but it also opens up additional opportunities for certain internships that require students to receive academic credit for their work.”
Some of the reading for the class will be slightly unconventional, according to Zenick.
“Students really don’t read these kinds of books,” Zenick said. “They are self-development texts that will help students understand themselves and the stage that they are at in life.”
Murday said that this course recognizes internships as fundamental in educating the whole person.
“I hope that this signals broader encouragement and support for students that want to have internships while in school here,” Murday said. “An internship is fundamental when looking at educating the whole person, and it’s a great experience that you can bring back to the classroom.”
The course also aims to provide students in internships with the tools necessary to engage their employers and fellow colleagues, help them develop skills that will narrow their area of focus and give them the resources to translate their work into future opportunities.
Kennelly said that this course challenges the assumed boundary between Georgetown classrooms and the world outside.
“Georgetown is a forward-thinking university that really emphasizes a focus on the whole person, and this one-credit internship program will give students the opportunity to understand how to erase those boundaries and see Georgetown as an integral part of every aspect of their lives,” Kennelly wrote.

Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) introduced legislation Nov. 12 that would strip the National Football League of its tax-exempt status if it continues to support the official team name of the Washington Redskins.
Norton proposed the bill after a perceived lack of action by the NFL, Federal Communications Commission and the Redskins organization on the issue. If passed, the bill will reduce the overall profits of NFL teams as long as they continue to support the “Redskins” team name. Currently, the NFL operates as a not-for-profit business league organization and is therefore tax-exempt.
“The time has come to get the attention of the NFL, which shares in the profits of our team, by hitting them in their wallet,” Norton said. “The Washington football team name is derogatory.”
Earlier this year, the U.S. Patent and Trade Office revoked the patent for the team name, saying that “Redskins” is offensive to Native Americans, prompting an appeal from team owner Dan Snyder. That case is ongoing.
Norton cited the copyright revocation decision and the complaints of Native Americans as grounds to introduce this legislation.
“Don’t just take my word,” she said. “If the word of the majority of Native Americans isn’t good enough, take the official word of the agency with jurisdiction over U.S. trademarks, the U.S. Patent and Trade Office.”
In her introduction of the bill, Norton said that the government involvement with subsidies justifies Congress’s involvement with the issue.
“American taxpayers have been subsidizing a multibillion dollar league that promotes what has now been officially found to be a racial slur for profitable gain,” she said. “Relief from taxes should no longer be given to a league that profits from the continued use of a racial slur, which degrades some Americans.”
The Redskins organization declined to comment. The NFL could not be reached for comment.
In a previous statement to The New York Times, Tony Wyllie, a Redskins team spokesperson, derided congressional action in response to a letter sent earlier this year from congressional leaders, including Norton, who urged a change in name.
“With all the important issues Congress has to deal with, such as a war in Afghanistan to deficits to health care, don’t they have more important issues to worry about than a football team’s name?” Wyllie wrote in the statement.
Norton’s bill follows a similar bill introduced in the Senate by Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and co-sponsored by Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) and Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in September. Norton’s bill has not received any co-sponsors.
Annapolis, Md., resident Madison Fisher (COL ’17) believes that the Washington football team should change its name and believes that taking away the NFL’s tax-exempt status would force it into doing so.
“The NFL is a huge moneymaking business,” she said. “I think that taking away their tax-exempt status would put pressure on them and call for some big changes.”
However, Fisher was skeptical about the legislation’s chances.
“I’m surprised Congress is getting involved,” she said. “I don’t know if that’s really their place, but … I don’t see the measure passing.”
Football fan Aditya Pande (SFS ’18) disagreed, arguing that congressional action is not warranted and that if a name change were to occur, the pressure should come from fans of the Washington football team.
“I think that this is a problem of the NFL, a private organization,” he said. “I think Congress has a lot more important things to be doing, like fixing the economy, for example.”

The Washington National Cathedral hosted its first-ever recitation of Friday Muslim prayers in a service last week, though a heckler interrupted the ceremony.
The closed ceremony invited special guests and a few hundred Muslims to pray at the cathedral, featuring the weekly prayers and a sermon from Ebrahim Rasool, South Africa’s ambassador to the United States.
“We come to this cathedral with sensitivity and humility but keenly aware that it is not a time for platitudes, because mischief is threatening the world,” Rasool said in his sermon, according to The Washington Post. “The challenge for us today is to reconstitute a middle ground of good people … whose very existence threatens extremism.”
A Michigan woman named Christine Weick drove up from Tennessee when she heard about the service at the Episcopal cathedral.
The Washington Post reported that Weick interrupted the prayer service to announce: “Jesus Christ died on that cross. He is the reason we are to worship only him. Jesus Christ is our Lord and savior. We have built … allowed you your mosques in this country. Why don’t you worship in your mosques and leave our churches alone? We are a country founded on Christian principles.”
According to The Washington Post, she was quickly removed from the cathedral, and the service continued. Other community leaders, including officials from the cathedral and local Muslims, followed Rasool, calling for increased interfaith dialogue and rejection of religious extremism.
Though this is the first time the weekly prayers have been invited into the cathedral, the church has previously hosted other interfaith events — including a prayer for Japan in 2011 after the tsunami and two Christian-Muslim summits involving dialogues between prominent faith leaders of both religions in 2010 and 2012.
“Washington National Cathedral is a house of prayer for all people, opening its doors to Americans of all faiths. It is an Episcopal church that recognizes that the United States is home to people of many faiths. The cathedral has long been home to interfaith gatherings and the call to prayer has been made within its walls by Christians, Muslims and Jews,” the Washington National Cathedral said in a statement to The Hoya.
This event originated from the cathedral’s relationship with Rasool, who had previously organized the cathedral’s honoring of Nelson Mandela after the South African leader’s death.
The occasion featured heavy security that the organizers attributed to threats received by the cathedral in response to the service.
Despite the interruption, the cathedral reported positive reviews of the service.
“Participants, both Christians and Muslims, found it moving to witness each other’s prayers and sacred space,” the Washington National Cathedral said.

Washington, D.C., is the second-best place in the country at combatting the costs of lung cancer, according to the financial website Wallethub.
Wallethub ranked all 50 states and the District of Columbia based on their efforts to combat the economic and societal impacts of the disease, analyzing air quality, death rates from lung cancer, the number of tobacco users per capita and various other elements.
Hawaii was the only state to be ranked above the District, with Alaska, Utah and New Jersey rounding out the top five.
The final rankings were a composite of two factors: “favorable environment for avoiding lung cancer” and “lung cancer prevalence and prevention.” D.C. was ranked 14th and fourth, respectively.
According to the American Lung Association, the economic costs of smoking and lung cancer in D.C. exceed $600 million per year. There are over 650 cases of smoking-related cancer in the District each year, about 400 of which are lung cancer.
Roughly 20 percent of adults and 13 percent of high school students in D.C. smoke, with an estimated economic cost due to smoking of almost $627,000. In 2013, there were 724 deaths in D.C. attributable to smoking.
Wallethub’s study ranked D.C. fourth in the country for the lowest death rate from lung cancer, and fifth for the highest percentage of smokers who attempted to quit.
Despite the positive feedback from Wallethub, Kenneth Tercyak, a professor in the departments of oncology and pediatrics at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, said that state governments are not doing enough to prevent tobacco use.
“In D.C., we have smoke-free air laws and moderately high cigarette taxes,” Tercyak said. “However, the level of resources devoted to tobacco prevention and cessation fall short of national spending guidelines recommended by [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention].”
The American Lung Association assigns D.C. a letter grade of F in tobacco prevention and cessation coverage, but an A in smoke-free air and a B in cigarette taxes. Out of the estimated 1,030 people in D.C. who died from cancer in 2013, one in four died of lung cancer.
Lung cancer claims more lives in the United States than the next three most common types of cancer with a survival rate under 17 percent, and over 224,000 people in the United States will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year, according to the CDC.
The disease has a high financial toll as well. According to the National Institute of Health, lung cancer accounts for over $12 billion of total cancer costs around the United States. Premature death from lung cancer among adults aged 20 and older results in over $36 billion in lost productivity each year.
Indiana University health science professor Jon Macy explained that preventing people from smoking is the most effective way to prevent lung cancer.
“State and local governments should implement comprehensive tobacco prevention and cessation programs,” Macy said. “Such programs would include increasing the cost of tobacco by raising taxes, adopting smoke-free air laws that prohibit smoking in all public places and workplaces, and providing access to proven tobacco cessation treatment.”
According to Chris Davis of the Lung Cancer Alliance, early detection is crucial in fighting the disease.
“Education and wellness programs as well as screening initiatives help combat lung cancer,” Davis said. “In fact, screening programs are already in place to help catch the disease earlier. We know that lung cancer screening can save lives when carried out responsibly and following current best practices.”
In the battle against lung cancer and smoking, a large disparity exists between states. For example, in terms of cigarette taxes, New York’s taxes, the highest in the nation, are 26 times higher than those in Missouri, the lowest.
“States vary considerably in their policies,” Macy said. “Some states still have tobacco taxes that are too low, some states still have smoke-free air laws that are too weak, and all states underfund their tobacco prevention and cessation programs.”
Despite the reduction in cigarette smoking across the country over the past 60 years, Macy warned that this progress was fragile.
“I think we are at a very important point in the fight against lung cancer,” Macy said. “If we adequately fund tobacco prevention and cessation programs, then we can continue this success and see further reductions in smoking-related diseases, including lung cancer.  If we don’t, then I don’t think we will see much progress.”

National Center for Cultural Competence Director Tawara Goode conducted a pilot study earlier this year exploring the impact of “Truth and Reconciliation” community forums on overcoming barriers to racial and ethnic participation in the health care system. The study also noted ways to restore trust in the research community after various injustices over the past century.
The study, conducted in association with the Georgetown-Howard Universities Center for Clinical and Translational Science, brought 29 people to the community forums held in Washington, D.C., in January and May 2014.
Goode researched whether the forums could reduce ethnic research barriers.
“What I did with this research was to formulate a question that looked at barriers to participation in research — and this is by racial and ethnic groups other than non-Hispanic white — can they be reduced by truth and reconciliation forums,” Goode said.
Participants completed questionnaires before and after the forums, revealing reluctance to participate in studies that required overnight stays in hospitals or the usage of experimental drugs.
According to a report of the experiment presented by Brian Clark of the Catholic University of America, a research intern on the experiment, the four main themes that emerged from the study were fear of and lack of trust toward the research community, lack of knowledge or information about research and a lack of inconvenience of the study or logistical issues.
Goode and the other researchers are still analyzing the data from the study after completing the pilot research, but according to Clark’s report, the research found that “respondents were less willing to participate in studies the more invasive the procedures.”
The January forum focused on acknowledging past wrongs carried out by the research community during the 20th century. It addressed the Tuskegee syphilis experiment in which African Americans sharecroppers participated in a government study of syphilis but were never informed that they had the diseases, as well as the unknown usage of cells from Henrietta Lacks to conduct medical experiments.
During the session, Goode and the other researchers issued an apology on behalf of the research community. Participants then looked at the safeguards in place to prevent any discrimination by researchers.
“I was absolutely shocked — just blown away,” participant Allyson Coleman said after learning about the research injustices, according to a press release from the Georgetown University Medical Center.
At the May forum, participants looked into disparities in the District and how those disparities influence D.C. residents, then brainstormed how to overcome these barriers to research that exist in communities.
Goode said that community members are often unaware of ways to get involved in research besides simply participating as a subject, pointing to help with data collection and writing of articles to spread information as other potential areas of contribution.
“There is not this one way that you can participate in research. It is very empowering that you can participate in different ways,” Goode said.
Goode hoped to receive additional funding to conduct the Truth and Reconciliation Forums on a larger scale than the original 29 participants. Goode said that her study has significant implications and warrants further research.
“We need to know whether or not apologies can make a difference,” Goode said, “I think that the other thing is that when you engage communities in such dynamic forums, that you demystify research, that you break down some of the barriers between people you want to participate in research and those research institutions.”

North Korean defector Yeonmi Park spoke about her experience fleeing her home country in Gaston Hall on Sunday in an event hosted by student group Truth and Human Rights in North Korea.
Park spoke about her life in North Korea as well as her defection, which took her to China and later to South Korea. Growing up, she was without many of the things Westerners take for granted, but her living situation was not yet dire.
“There was no Internet, but I was not starving,” Park said.
Park said her life changed after her father was arrested for illegal trading. In the wake of the arrest, Park’s mother was interrogated by the government for two years.
These experiences led Park to defect when she was 13 with the help of smugglers, and with the help of the embassy in China, she entered university life. Park said that after defecting, she identified as a South Korean, not wanting to reveal her past.
“I was so careful about my identity,” Park said.
Park was separated from her sister, who also defected, for seven years, and now that they have reunited, she said her goal is to help her sister adjust to life outside of North Korea.
“So now I am trying to tell her she is not the victim and she fought for her freedom and her life” Park said.
Park has become a media personality, and has said she hopes to share her story with as many people as she can.
“I decided to speak out and it became my kind of job,” Park said. “If I speak out, people will listen to me.”
The floor was later opened for a question-and-answer period in which guests asked Park about a range of topics, including what it was like to experience Western culture for the first time.
Halle Hagan (SFS ’18) said the program offered a chance to hear a firsthand account of what it was like to live in a communist nation.
“I have always been interested in North Korea and other communist regimes, particularly because North Korea is one of the last couple that we have as modern day communist regimes and it was really fascinating to hear Yeonmi’s speech,” Hagan said. “I thought that she was really an inspiration,w especially as a young person for us to look up to as an example of someone who has used her experiences to do good and promote certain ideas throughout the world.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Park defected at age 23. She was 13.

David says 
November 19, 2014 at 4:52 pm
Thanks for the Hoya article, Sarah!
Just a small factual error… she is currently younger than 23 years old, so she couldn’t possibly have escaped when she was 23. The actual age was 13 when she left.

November 18, 2014 by Natalie LaRue Leave a Comment 
Hispanic students have made significant strides toward increasing the average scores on national math tests over the course of the last decade, with public school students in cities including Washington, D.C., making some of the most impressive progress, according to a study released Monday by the Child Trends Hispanic Institute.
According to the National Assessment on Education Progress, a biennially released measure of progress by K-12 public school students across the country, Hispanic students’ average math scores rose by 13 points in eighth grade and nine points in fourth grade between 2003 and 2013 nationally. In the public schools in the District, scores rose 21 points for fourth-graders and 16 points for eighth-graders between those dates.
Natalie Pane, author of the study and senior vice president of research operations at Child Trends, said that the results reflected an increased quality of education from D.C. public schools.
“Washington, D.C., was named as one of our honorable mentions,” Pane said. “This was because D.C. [made] … significant gains statistically and educationally. [D.C.] was able to come from near the bottom and move up into the mid-range of scores for 2013, an impressive feat.”
However, D.C.’s consistent growth has paled in comparison to the significant progress made by schools in Miami, Charlotte, Houston, Boston, Dallas and Austin. Washington has seen no significant short-term increase in scores in recent years, Pane said.
“D.C. was not named as a top-tier notable district because, after many years of consistent and strong gains, the recent scores have been level. There were no statistically significant increases in the short-term,” Pane said.
Over the long term, however, Pane noted that the trends in D.C. related to Hispanic students were moving in a positive direction. In 2003, 8 percent of students taking the grade-four NAEP assessment in District schools were Hispanic. By 2013, 14 percent of the students were Hispanic. At the same time, however, the percentage of English language learners who are Hispanic in D.C. dropped from 51 percent in 2003 to only 37 percent in 2013.
“[But] this change was not enough to account for much of the score increases,” Pane said.
According to D.C. Schools Coordinator Sinead Carolan (SFS ’17), the progress of Hispanic students has been reflected in their attitudes toward school and learning.
“Several of our tutees really enjoy doing their math homework above their reading homework,” Carolan said. “[This] is potentially a result of the fact that they cannot speak English very well, but have an easier time understanding the universal language of numbers.”
Education reform has been a contested issue in District politics, featured prominently in the mayoral election campaign earlier this month. Current Mayor Vincent Gray emphasized the issue throughout his term as well, claiming credit for the substantial improvements.
“Our education reforms [are yielding] positive results and businesses are eager to stake their claim in the District,” Gray said in a statement on his website.
Mayor-elect Muriel Bowser promised to keep education reform central to her campaign a priority during her term, as the quality of public schools in the District is very unequal across wards.
According to Pane, this level of inequality between schools is not uncommon in large cosmopolitan areas.
“The District has rates of poverty comparable to other large urban districts,” Pane said.
In the United States as a whole, there has been a large increase in the size of the Hispanic population, pointing to the necessity of improving the performance of Hispanic students and developing ways to measure this performance. According to the 2012 U.S. Census, within the next 50 years, America will “become a plurality nation, where the non-Hispanic white population remains the largest single group, but no group is in the majority.”
Pane explained that the NAEP provides a standard of comparison across diverse states.
“The NAEP is critical to our understanding of what students across the United States know and can do,” Pane said. “Each state sets its own standards for proficiency on their state tests. NAEP proficiency is the same for everyone.”
Pane is hopeful that the prominence of the NAEP and the work of Child Trends will draw attention to the importance of education reform.
“Investment in education reform is justifiable for our economic growth and stability, our health and well-being, and maintaining a civil and just society,” Pane said. “Even though we don’t know exactly how to push the lever at full scale, we have enough examples of successful changes that we know we can do it better.”
