A graduate student was the victim of an attempted robbery on 37th Street at around 8:00 p.m. Sunday.
According to a public safety alert emailed to the campus community Friday evening, the student reported to the Department of Public Safety that she was approached by an unknown male while walking near the intersection of 37th and R Streets. The suspect crossed the street and grabbed her in an attempt to steal her backpack. The student then yelled at the suspect and ran south on 37th Street.
The suspect is described in the PSA as a 25 year old black male, about 6-foot-5 and thin with light skin and a scruffy beard. He was also described as wearing an olive green hooded jacket and baggy jeans.
The Metropolitan Police Department was notified and is handling the investigation. The incident was not reported to DPS until 1:30 p.m. Friday. Representatives of DPS could not be reached for comment at press time.

An adult male died after being found unconscious on the bike path below the Key Bridge on the evening of Friday, December 16, according to the Metropolitan Police Department.
In a report released the following May, MPD ruled the death a suicide, according to Georgetown Patch.
At the time of the incident, Officer Hugh Carew of MPD’s Public Information Office confirmed that a U.S. Park Police Officer collapsed while responding to the scene. According to The Washington Post, the officer was identified as Sgt. Michael Boehm. He was transported to the Georgetown University Hospital after collapsing, where he later died.
Both lanes of the Key Bridge were closed following the incidents. Though vehicular traffic on the bridge has reopened, the pedestrian walkway on the upstream side of the bridge remains closed. In addition, access to the bike path below the bridge has been blocked of.
Reports of the incident have been conflicting. The D.C. Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency reported that a man jumped off the bridge at around 6 p.m., but Carew said that he could not confirm anything about man jumping off the bridge. It is unclear whether the individual found on the towpath is the same person who reportedly jumped from the Key Bridge.
Representatives of DC HSEMA could not be reached for comment.
