The moral challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the importance of ethics in the field of health care, Dr. Anthony Fauci said during a Zoom event. 
The Feb. 19 event, hosted by the Georgetown University Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics, featured an hourlong conversation with Fauci and Dr. Myles Sheehan, S.J., director of the center. Fauci is currently serving as President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser and has been at the forefront of the U.S. government’s pandemic response since March 2020. Fauci and Sheehan discussed a variety of topics, including the public roles of physicians and how the COVID-19 pandemic has reasserted the importance of examining ethics in health care.
Ethicists and health care providers must take the opportunity to reflect on the grave consequences of the pandemic, according to Fauci.
“The lessons that I learned from this outbreak is that there are a lot of ethical considerations that come in,” Fauci said during the Zoom event. “The availability and accessibility of interventions, be they vaccines or therapies, the relationship between your responsibility to your country and the moral obligation that you might have to take care of those who are less fortunate.”
The coronavirus, which was first recorded in the United States in Jan. 2020, has killed more than 2.4 million people worldwide. The U.S. death toll alone recently surpassed 500,000 deaths on Feb. 22.
Bioethics is particularly significant to Fauci because his wife, Dr. Christine Grady, serves as the head of the Department of Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, according to Fauci. 
“I have become extremely appreciative of the importance and the depth and the breadth of the field of bioethics, obviously because I’m married to one of the top bioethicists in the country,” Fauci said. “Her thesis was the ethics of clinical trials in vaccines.”
Bioethics may be an underappreciated public health field, but it is of vital importance, according to Fauci. 
“A lot of people feel, ‘Oh I don’t really need an ethics consult; I can figure this one out — you know, ethics comes naturally,’” Fauci said. “A whole variety of things that, you know, you think you know a lot about until you’re hit with a very important question that requires people who have skills and experience in ethics that can really help you out.”
Vaccine distribution processes vary from state to state, which has brought more attention to racial and socioeconomic disparities in the U.S. health care system. Of the 13 million Americans who received the vaccine during the first month of distribution in the United States, only 5% were Black, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vaccine distribution is an issue that expands beyond the United States, with 130 countries having yet to receive a single dose of the vaccine.
Ethicists play an essential role in the debate over which individuals to prioritize when distributing the vaccine, according to Fauci. 
“Ethicists should appreciate how important their calling is, their field, because they often feel that it’s a field that’s kind of vague — a little bit disrespected,” Fauci said. “When you get vaccines available and you look at the availability of vaccine throughout the world vs. the rich countries, those are all ethical considerations.” 
Science is intrinsically tied to the humanities, and to be a good doctor your knowledge must be holistic, according to Fauci. 
“I would say with all do respect to the hardcore science — you know, biology and chemistry and all the things you really need to know — that my skill as a physician is dependent as much on the humanitarian education that I got with the classics than understanding the biology of a particular organ system,” Fauci said.

Georgetown University ranks second among the nation’s colleges and universities in graduating women who go on to lead venture capital firms, according to a report published by the investment company Different Funds. 
The April 2019 report, which was included in a recent MSB press release, compares the backgrounds of general partners at emerging venture capital firms. The report finds close to 4.5% of female general partners are graduates from Georgetown, ranking second behind Harvard University with close to 5% of general partners. The report featured graduates from over 100 different universities with undergraduate programs. 
The Georgetown Venture Fellows Program, a one-year apprenticeship in a venture capital or private equity firm for undergraduate and graduate students, has fostered an environment in which women at Georgetown are encouraged to join the field of venture capital, according to a Feb. 16 news release from the McDonough School of Business. 
The success of women who have graduated from the program is a testament to the need for female representation and perspectives in venture capital, according to Jeff Reid, director of the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative. 
“Venture capital is, in many ways, it’s like an exclusive club,” Reid said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Once you get in, you have a lot of opportunities, but getting in the door is the hardest part. Getting a Venture Fellowship is a way to get in the club, and so the Venture Fellowship allows both women and men to take that first step to getting that experience.”
Across all U.S. venture capital firms, only 4.9% of partners are women, of which 33% are women of color, and 2.4% are founding partners, according to Fast Company, an American business magazine. 
Barriers to women’s entry into the venture capital field can often start at the university level, according to Reid. 
“Anecdotally, when I speak to a few other university entrepreneurship leaders, they often have trouble getting women to participate in their entrepreneurship programs,” Reid said. “Entrepreneurship, just like venture capital, can often be seen as an all-boys network, or a ‘bro-culture.’” 
Over the last few years, Georgetown has awarded over 80% of its competition prizes, including the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Challenge, the university’s largest annual pitch competition, to women-led teams. This trend signifies the success of female students as well as their important role in business programs, according to Reid. 
Estelle Spanneut (MSB ’21), a Venture Fellow in 2020, will pursue a career in the industry after graduation. Spanneut said she came to this decision after competing in the Venture Capital Investment Competition, a global business competition hosted by the University of North Carolina. 
Her time as a Venture Fellow introduced her to the network required to join the world of venture capital, according to Spanneut. 
“It’s really easy to say that you want to do venture capital, but it’s so much harder to get into it,” Spanneut said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “It’s a really hard industry to get into, especially as an undergrad, especially as a woman, like, all these different factors.” 
The 2020 Venture Fellows class included 10 graduate students and five undergraduate fellows, marking the first time undergraduate students were invited to participate. The 2020 cohort was the largest since the program’s founding in 2015. 
Working with the cohort of fellows provides female students with the networking experience that is critical to succeeding the venture capital, according to Natalie Poston (GRD ’21), another 2020 Venture Fellow. 
“It’s just very network driven, and, historically, those networks have not always included women, have not always included people of color, and unfortunately you just see people hiring those in their network or that are like them,” Poston said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “So, I think breaking in is a part of it, and I think what’s great about the study is that Georgetown as a network has done really well in terms of infiltrating the V.C. industry.”

Georgetown University undergraduate hybrid courses will remain fully virtual until March 8 as COVID-19 infections among students remain high.
The university originally moved graduate and undergraduate hybrid courses to virtual instruction Jan. 28 following a spike in COVID-19 cases among Georgetown community members living on and near campus. Graduate courses were cleared to restart in-person instruction as of Feb. 15, but all undergraduate hybrid courses and activities will remain virtual, according to a Feb. 18 university-wide email.
Although in-person learning has been paused since Jan. 28, students and professors are energized by the opportunity for in-person instruction, according to Fr. Mark Bosco, S.J., who is teaching a hybrid class about British author Graham Greene.
“You could see they were excited to be on campus, they were excited to be in a classroom, I was excited by their energy,” Bosco said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. 
While Bosco only had two in-person classes this semester, he said he saw a noticeable change in the demeanour of students who were able to return to in-person learning.
“I felt immediately the difference again of feeling back in college, back on campus, watching the facial expressions and the interactions of people,” Bosco said. 
While operating fully virtually last semester, the university began piloting graduate and undergraduate hybrid courses in November. This semester, around 200 hybrid courses were offered to graduate students and undergraduate seniors living on campus or in the Georgetown neighborhood.
The chance to interact with fellow students in person allowed for more vibrant class discussions, according to Regan Donecker (MSB ’21), who took a hybrid strategic management class in the fall and is registered for a hybrid education, inquiry and justice capstone course this semester. 
“It was nice to have the opportunity to talk with my peers in a more casual setting,” Donecker wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Class discussion was refreshing as people could have more open conversations.” 
Since the university reopened after winter break, there have been 332 confirmed COVID-19 cases among Georgetown community members as of Feb. 22. After 25 cases were discovered in just a few days, the university announced a change of operating status, switching to fully virtual instruction and restricting access to Lauinger Library.
Faculty and students can opt out of in-person instruction at any time and are required to adhere to all university health and safety guidelines, according to a university spokesperson.
“As with all decisions during the pandemic, this decision was made subject to change based on pandemic conditions,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Students in hybrid courses are not required to come to campus, and we have worked creatively to ensure their continued learning in a virtual environment.”
The university should open Lauinger Library, which is currently only available by reservation to students living on campus and graduate students with approval, not to undergraduate seniors, according to Donecker.
“We lack study spaces and live in communal town houses, so it is hard to find quiet space to work,” Donecker wrote. “Even if the university decides to cancel hybrid courses, the senior class deserves a work space where we can easily spread out.”

When Jean-Paul Nguyen (COL ’24) first heard that a winter storm was coming to his hometown of Houston, Texas, he expected it to be nothing more than an opportunity to play in the snow. 
What followed, however, was a week of despair and uncertainty as Texans, including several Georgetown University students, went without power or water for as long as seven days. A severe winter storm struck Texas on Feb. 14, causing power outages across the state. While power has now begun to return to households, many are left without access to clean water because of frozen pipes and electrical disruptions.
The power outages were unexpected, leaving no time for preparation, according to Nguyen.
“Our power went off as I was preparing for a chemistry test at one a.m. Monday morning, but I went to sleep assuming that the power would turn on in the morning,” Nguyen wrote in a text to The Hoya. 
However, Nguyen’s power stayed off, and he was unable to attend classes for the week of Feb. 15-19, right before the beginning of midterm exam season. While electricity came back on in short bursts, it was not reliable enough to attend classes, according to Nguyen, who passed the time by reading his textbooks and worrying about the missed class time. 
“The electricity schedule was so messed up that I couldn’t predict when I could go to class. It was a miracle if I could, but I could only attend one or two classes,” Nguyen wrote. “It made emailing my teachers even harder because I had a poor cellular connection and it was exam week for two of my classes.”
In addition to power outages, many Texans faced the issue of water shortages, according to Nguyen. 
“Our water was in danger of being shut off, and some people’s houses were completely shut off from the water, so they had to take the snow from outside and melt it so that they could have water to drink or to flush their toilets,” Nguyen said. 
Being away is difficult while his home state is in crisis, according to Jack Pedigo (COL ’24), who is from Houston but is living in Washington, D.C., for the spring semester.
“Watching from the outside — knowing that my family is struggling and I cannot be there for them — is an extremely painful reality I’m having to deal with,” Pedigo wrote. “I feel helpless.” 
Unlike Nguyen, the severe devastation caused by the snowstorm did not come as a surprise because of the increasingly grave consequences of climate change, according to Pedigo. 
“I’m most sad about the fact that I’m not surprised at all about what happened,” Pedigo wrote in a text to The Hoya. “I have hope that after this winter storm, Texans will begin to accept that climate change is real, and that delaying action any further will result in similar — perhaps even more devastating — natural disasters in the future.”
Georgetown University Mutual Aid Network, a student group established this year to help distribute funds to students in need, has been working to assist students impacted by the storm. It has collected and distributed donations that have gone toward food, transportation, clothing and housing, according to Binqi Chen (NHS ’22), a representative from GU Mutual Aid. 
“We’ve all followed alongside the stories that have and continue to come out of communities in Texas and have our thoughts with the folks in Texas,” Chen wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our DMs and requests remain open to supporting any need that Hoyas from Texas may need to recover from the last week.”
In the university’s effort to support students, academic deans and advisors sent emails to impacted students inquiring about their well-being. The university’s efforts meant well, but did not go far enough to actively help students, according to Pedigo.
“The emails just seemed a bit obligatory. There wasn’t a widespread effort, just at the discretion of individual deans and advisors,” Pedigo said. “It was more ‘are you okay’ and less of ‘what can we do?’ Minimum effort, it seemed like to me.”
In response to the storm, Georgetown has worked with students and professors to encourage flexibility, according to a university spokesperson.
“We closely monitored the situation in Texas following last week’s severe winter weather. We have shared several resources with our community and our deans are working with affected students on academic flexibility,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The university and professors were considerate and helpful, according to Nguyen, who did not have the ability to contact his professors or access virtual classwork during the storm. 
“The main effort from the community that I’ve experienced was my dean reaching out to me if I needed any help with reaching out to my professors or giving me resources to contact if I needed to talk to someone,” Nguyen said. “My professors have been really understanding of my entire situation thankfully, but I’m still a week behind on work.”

The space occupied by longtime Georgetown music establishment Blues Alley Jazz Club has been put up for sale by building owners, but venue leadership says the club is not going anywhere. 
Blues Alley, located on Wisconsin Avenue, was founded in 1965 and has hosted well-known jazz performers like Miles Davis and Eva Cassidy since its opening. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the venue closed its doors to the public last March. After negotiations over the lease between Executive Director Harry Schnipper and building owner Snyder Properties, the building has been listed for sale, according to NBC4. 
However, Schnipper says reports of the venue closing are false. Although the property is for sale, Blues Alley does not plan on closing permanently, according to Schnipper. 
“We have a lease, so we’re planning to stay there. We have every intention of staying in the District of Columbia,” Schnipper said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Just because the owners put the property on the market doesn’t mean that we are going to move. We just can’t reopen because of the pandemic.”
Blues Alley is looking for an alternative location in Washington, D.C., in the interim, Schnipper said, as the venue is too small to accommodate live music and an audience based on D.C.’s phased reopening plan and social distancing regulations.
The venue is working through the pandemic’s challenges, according to Schnipper. 
“I would say it’s frustrating, but I don’t think it’s — I’m going to use the word — unnavigable,” Schnipper said. “First of all, we’re America’s oldest continuously operating jazz supper club. We have been in business for 56 years. The bad news is that we are now probably the only jazz club left in Washington, D.C.”
Other jazz clubs in the District, including Bohemian Caverns and Twins Jazz, have closed permanently during the pandemic. 
Blues Alley has streamed virtual performances weekly from the National Press Club in downtown D.C. The venue also has a variety of upcoming virtual events planned, including an International Jazz Day celebration and the Annual Ella Fitzgerald jazz vocal competition, according to Schnipper. 
The jazz club is a valuable source of cultural life, according to long-time Blues Alley attendee Maurice Jackson, a professor in Georgetown University’s history department and African American Studies Program and the affiliated professor of music (jazz).
“It was a place that served as a hub for people of all colors, class and everything to be. It was not a fancy club, it was sort of dumpy in some ways. There was nothing fancy about it, but that was also the beauty about it,” Jackson said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It’s a landmark. We don’t have many places like that left where people can just go.” 
Schnipper hopes to reopen the venue later in 2021 and to potentially open full seating capacity by the year’s fourth quarter, according to the Blues Alley website. In the meantime, the venue is working to support the jazz genre, according to Schnipper. 
“We continue to keep jazz music alive via our loyal listeners, by supporting our local musicians, our staff Go-Fund-Me campaign, our industry partnerships and our Blues Alley logoed merchandise sales,” Schnipper wrote in a statement on the Blues Alley website. 
Moira Ross, a wait staff member at Blues Alley, organized a GoFundMe page to support the club’s bartenders, waitresses and employees during the pandemic that raised over 33 thousand dollars as of yet. After years of hosting jazz legends, Blues Alley is now in need of assistance, according to Ross. 
“My 22 years working with the wait staff seems minimal when compared to others who have spanned over 3 decades,” Ross wrote on the GoFundMe page. “Now my Blues Alley family needs help.”
The value of Blues Alley extends beyond the music itself, according to Jackson. 
“Jazz does so much to bring people together,” Jackson said. “It does so much in analyzing social problems. If you listen to the lyrics, if you listen to what the musicians, human beings really care about the social conditions. They travel all over the world carrying their music, but they like coming back to places like Blues Alley because it was always a place like home.”

Washington, D.C., has witnessed a large increase in carjackings since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting the creation of a new Metropolitan Police Department task force and heightening caution throughout neighborhoods. 
The number of carjackings in the District more than doubled in 2020 compared to the year before, with 142 carjackings in 2019 and 345 in 2020. In the same time frame, other auto theft incidents increased by 51%. While the Georgetown area has seen little change in carjacking rates, officials advise community members in all D.C. neighborhoods to take precautions. 
District Police Chief Robert Contee III said at a Feb. 9 press conference that the department would confront the problem by creating a new task force while working with local and federal authorities, including the FBI. Individuals can also take precautions to reduce the likelihood of carjackings, according to Contee.
“I would like to remind the public, especially our delivery drivers in areas such as this, that there are ways you can prevent your auto from being stolen. Never leave your engine running and unattended,” Contee said during the press conference.
Former D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans’ car was stolen in front of his Georgetown home Monday. According to a police report, the car was stolen around 3:40 p.m. and was running with the keys inside. 
Evans is not the only D.C. politician to fall victim to an auto theft. Councilmember Mary Cheh’s (D-Ward 3) car was stolen in December as she stopped into Bread Furst Bakery. She had left her car parked but running and unlocked, according to Councilmember Cheh. 
“These things can happen in an instant, they are crimes of opportunity, so I urge everyone to stay alert and take precautions — like double checking that your car is locked, never leave it running, and using anti-theft devices,” Cheh said in a tweet following the incident.
Ward 2, which includes the area in and around Georgetown, saw the smallest increase in carjackings in the entire city, according to data released by the Metropolitan Police Department. Carjackings in Ward 2 increased by 29% from 2019 to 2020, compared to the citywide increase of 143%.
Since delivery drivers often leave their vehicle engines running during the few seconds they leave their car to deliver food to people’s homes, these workers are especially susceptible to carjackings, according to Director of the Department of For-Hire Vehicles David Do. The increased volume of food deliveries during the pandemic along with colder weather are main drivers of the increase in carjackings. 
“Leaving your car on for just a second is not worth it,” Do said during the press conference. “And if you do fall victim of car theft, please do not fight back and let MPD do that work.”  
While Georgetown University administrators are not aware of any community members having been affected by carjackings or other spikes in criminal activity, students are advised to follow general safety measures when possible, according to a university spokesperson. 
“With the colder weather and more hours of darkness both in the mornings and evenings, we urge students in the neighborhood to take precautions to increase their personal safety and the safety of the Georgetown University community,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Montgomery County, Md., has also seen a rise in carjackings since the beginning of the pandemic, with nine incidents in January 2021 alone compared to zero in the same month the previous year. 
In the event of a carjacking or auto theft, citizens should be cooperative and avoid taking any safety risks, according to Montgomery County Sergeant Rebecca Innocenti.
“If someone approaches you and demands your keys, give up your vehicle,” Innocenti said in an interview with MyMCM. “We don’t want people to resist or to put up a fight. It’s simply just not worth your safety or your life.”

The number of students enrolled as public health minors in the Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies has increased significantly over the course of the last year in conjunction with the lasting presence and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The university has seen a 70% increase in students declaring a minor in public health since last spring compared to the previous year, according to professor Laura Anderko, the faculty director of the public health minor program. The minor has been available to students of all four undergraduate schools since 2018. 
Ana Maria Alonso Munana (COL ’22), a psychology major, said that she originally chose to minor in public health because it aligned with her field of study, but the COVID-19 pandemic only reaffirmed her decision.
“The COVID-19 pandemic, despite its terrible consequences, has given me the opportunity to look at a major public health issue from several different lenses in my public health courses,” Munana wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Furthermore, this pandemic has motivated me even more to keep learning with the goal of being part of positive change in the future.”   
The recent surge in interest for a minor in public health is especially exciting because the program has attracted students from many different disciplines, according to Anderko.
“There is this wonderful exchange of ideas and perspectives because of the variety of the majors and the students,” Anderko said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It’s not just health care, people that want to learn more about public health. It makes the learning much richer.”
Many students minoring in public health are on the pre-med path, but the program has seen an influx from psychology and government majors, according to Anderko.
The public health minor is composed of three required courses — health concepts, epidemiology and a population health capstone — as well as three elective courses that go more in-depth into key concepts like health policy, health promotion, environmental health and global health.
Due to the pandemic, students are realizing that studying public health can complement many different majors and interests, according to Lauren Quick (NHS ’22), a nursing student who is pursuing a minor in public health.
“The pandemic has definitely highlighted the presence of public health issues, specifically surrounding accessibility and health equity,” Quick wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think that more people will realize that when it comes to public health, everyone is a stakeholder and I hope that this will result in students bringing a concern for public health issues into different sectors.”
Public health has applications that extend far beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, and the field plays a vital role in many other professions and academic disciplines, according to Munana.
“Communities all over the world are in need of good Public Health initiatives to improve their quality of life,” Munana wrote. “From vaccination campaigns, family planning, to water policies or motor safety laws, public health professionals play a key role in disease prevention and education.”
The increasing popularity of studying public health is not unique to the public health minor. Many other health care-related university courses and programs have seen increased interest and enrollees, according to a university spokesperson.
“The School of Nursing & Health Studies had the most applications ever to its undergraduate programs at over 1,800,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Applications to the bachelor of science programs in nursing, global health, and health care management & policy rose this year.”
As the NHS has continued to grow, the university announced plans to split the NHS into two separate schools, the Georgetown School of Nursing and the Georgetown School of Health, by July 2022.
While the pandemic revealed many failings in current public health policy, Anderko remains optimistic about the future of health care and public health policymaking. The increase in the number of Georgetown students who desire to create change in the world through public health programs will have positive impacts on health care policy for years to come, according to Anderko.
“I think it’s wonderful,” Anderko said. “We’ve seen that a failure in basic public health concepts can lead to extreme pressure in our healthcare system and that we really have to work together, and that students that are recognizing the need to integrate public health into their work is only going to make us healthier.”

Nine Georgetown University students and graduates have been selected as finalists for a selective training and development program for the United States federal government civil service.
The finalists, who were selected from a pool of over 6,280 applicants, are all current students or graduates of Georgetown’s Master of Science in Foreign Service program. They will participate in the Presidential Management Fellows Program, a two-year, fully funded program administered by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management that aims to develop a small group of future government leaders, according to the program website. 
Georgetown currently has 40 students and graduates in the PMF program — the most of any college or university in the U.S. 
The number of Georgetown students accepted into the PMF program represents the value of public service at the university, according to Joel Hellman, Dean of the School of Foreign Service.
“It is a great source of pride for us to see so many of our students choose to apply and get accepted into the Presidential Management Fellows Program because it says we are doing what we were created to do,” Hellman said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “We were created a hundred years ago to encourage the next generation of leaders to pursue public service at the highest levels, and the Presidential Management Fellows Program is exactly that. It is a mechanism for choosing the best and the brightest to commit to careers in public service.”
Finalists in the program are appointed to various U.S. government agencies under the title of Presidential Management Fellows. After completing the program, fellows are eligible for full-time government positions. 
Ava Tavrazich (MSFS ’21), who is a PMF finalist this year, is excited to use her knowledge of Latin America and the Caribbean to conduct diplomacy in the Western Hemisphere and help improve political and economic relations between the U.S. and its regional partners.
The Georgetown community and the university’s close relationship with politics led Tavrazich to apply for the fellowship, she said. 
“Being here in Washington and having the opportunity to do internships and be connected with other students who have lived in D.C. and worked for the government really inspired me to continue to do public service,” Tavrazich said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Georgetown and my MSFS program positioned students to pursue a career of public service and be in the right place to apply to fellowships with a good chance of success.”
The application process involves the submission of a resume and short essay answers, as well as an online assessment, a four-part exam that tests applicants on situational judgment, life experience, problem-solving and writing. 
The School of Foreign Service Graduate Career Center helps guide students through the PMF application process, according to Moira Todd, career coach at the GCC.
“Primarily in the fall, the SFS GCC amplifies the information about the PMF program that is provided by the Government and encourages students to apply,” Todd wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We communicate the requirements of the program, timelines, share their resources, and advertise information sessions hosted by the government representatives.” 
However, mentorship does not end with the application process, according to Professor Nicole Sedaca, deputy director of the MSFS. Georgetown faculty and staff members are dedicated to helping students during the entire duration of their time in the PMF program, Sedaca said.
“Our Graduate Career Center does a great deal to familiarize our students with the process, to help them prepare for what they will have to do in the interviews or to write their essays. Once the students have been selected into the program, that is not the end of the process,” Sedaca said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Once you are in the program, you then have the challenge of finding a position in government, and there are quite a few people, myself included, who then will meet with students and mentor them to help them craft a strategy for finding the place they will land in government.”
Georgetown will likely continue performing well at competitions that value students’ recognition of public service, according to Hellman.
“The students who come to Georgetown are motivated, in the first place, by the ethos and mission of the university. For SFS in particular, a school that has ‘service’ in the very name, it is fundamental to our mission to encourage students to think about serving in the public sector and the private sector, so I think we attract the kind of students that are interested in this career path,” Hellman said.

Georgetown University is the number one producer of Fulbright student scholars in the United States for the second consecutive year, with 39 students and graduates awarded scholarships. 
The Fulbright Program is an international exchange program available to undergraduate and graduate students to pursue individually designed research projects, pursue master’s degrees or teach English in foreign countries. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted this year’s program, with a portion of the 39 awardees possibly not accepting their scholarships because of concerns about health and wellbeing, depending on the specific safety guidelines of their host countries, according to a Feb. 17 university press release.
Most students were notified of their scholarship decisions during fall 2020 with their work or course schedules beginning in January 2021. Despite not being able to take in-person classes, the program still offered many opportunities to gain valuable experience, according to Sophia Mauro (SFS ’20), who is using her Fulbright scholarship to pursue a master’s degree in Turkish studies at Sabancı University in Istanbul, Turkey. 
“Fortunately, I was able to travel to Turkey in order to participate in my classes from the same time zone and in the same setting as my classmates,” Mauro wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Classes are not in person, and I’m staying in the city instead of on campus. Of course, classes are only part of the equation; Fulbright is also about connecting with the country that you’re staying in and the people that you’re surrounded by.” 
In last year’s scholarship cycle, 45 Georgetown students and graduates were named Fulbright recipients, which marked an all-time high in university history and placed Georgetown as the top university or college to generate Fulbright student scholars in the United States. During the 2018 cycle, 30 Georgetown students set the university’s then-record, after the 2017 cycle’s group of 27 Fulbright recipients. 
The process of applying for a Fulbright scholarship begins with the Georgetown Center for Research and Fellowships recruiting interested students, hosting information sessions about the application process and conducting one-on-one advising, according to Laura Perille, the associate director of the center. 
Students then submit their applications to Fulbright. However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the timeline of Fulbright applications shifted depending on the country to which students were applying, with some of the programs having their start date delayed, according to Perille. 
The application process to the Fulbright scholarships this year included a lot of time spent waiting to see if the programs would take place, according to Fulbright recipient Ashley Lane (SFS ’20), who is working as an English teaching assistant in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. 
“There was a lot of waiting and uncertainty surrounding the Fulbright program this year due to the pandemic. The final decision on our January departure date to Uzbekistan wasn’t made until late fall,” Lane wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In a ‘normal’ year, our 10-month grants would be from September to June, but this year that shifted to January to November 2021.”
Even after programs began as planned, the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic made for a more nerve-wracking Fulbright experience than anticipated, according to Gavin Myers (COL ’17), a master’s student at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Pollenzo, Italy. 
“Beyond the delayed start, it’s really impacted my level of comfort in a foreign nation,” Myers wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Normally, I’d feel pretty unphased by hopping on a plane into a totally new and strange, at least for me, place but now a lot of my experience is underscored by concerns for my health and anxiety around potentially having to navigate the Italian health system without speaking the language.” 
Over the past year, more than 2.8 million people have gotten COVID-19 in Italy, with over 96 thousand people who have died from the virus.
To adapt to the virtual environment, the Center for Research and Fellowships implemented new practices to support students throughout the Fulbright application process, according to Perille. The center introduced online question and answer sessions in addition to virtual drop-in sessions where students could join Zoom calls to work on their applications.
While the application process had to adapt because of the pandemic, the center has strived to maintain applicants’ enthusiasm, according to Perille. 
“We really want to emphasize that the application process is a valuable and meaningful experience, and we want to build that sense of community to keep people energized, to help them know that they are a part of something larger,” Perille said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
No matter the circumstances, preparation is key to make the most out of a Fulbright scholarship, according to Lane.
“My advice to prospective Fulbright Scholars or ETAs would be to prepare yourself as much as you can before you leave,” Lane wrote. “Your grant period will go by faster than you think, and whatever you can do before you leave — whether that’s learning your host country’s language or preparing yourself to teach or conduct research in-country — will help immensely in the transition.”

The Georgetown University Student Association presidential candidates discussed their plans to eliminate exclusivity and hierarchy in GUSA during the executive presidential debate.
On Feb. 22, candidates Daniella Sanchez (COL ’22) and Nile Blass (COL ’22) proposed plans to restructure GUSA, include student voices and continue advocacy for community-focused inclusivity. The GUSA Election Commission hosted and moderated the debate, devoting a portion of the event to audience questions. 
Sanchez, who is running alongside Leo Arnett (SFS ’22), was formerly speaker of the GUSA Senate and currently serves as co-director for student inclusion, director of COVID-19 response and a senate liaison for the executive staff’s engagement team. Blass, who is running alongside Nicole Sanchez (SFS ’22), currently serves as provost of the Student Advisory Committee under the executive administration.  
Both tickets are proposing restructuring GUSA to combat alleged elitism and exclusivity in the organization.
If elected, Blass and Sanchez plan to continue the current restructuring plan proposed in the GUSA Senate, including the elimination of Robert’s Rules of Order, a set of governing guidelines similar to parliamentary procedure, and other positions and titles that Blass and Sanchez believe creates too much of a hierarchy. 
The ticket hopes to create a new government body built upon student input by holding meetings with students who are not in GUSA to establish an inclusive restructuring plan, according to Blass. 
Blass and Sanchez’s administration plans to transform GUSA from an organization that promotes individual agendas to a student collective for advocacy composed of student leaders who are passionate about creating fundamental change, according to Blass.
“The titles, the clout, the resume-building, the exclusivity of projects and movements — all of this hinders real work to exist and to be done,” Blass said during the debate. “You need to remove existing barriers that deter advocacy. You need to ensure that the entire GUSA is elected, and it’s official and it has appointees, but they need to be a collective. They need to be buy-in. It needs to not just be you know someone who knows someone who can get you a position on a policy team.” 
Sanchez and Arnett’s administration is proposing a four-step restructuring process that starts with gathering student input on GUSA. If elected, the ticket plans to create a restructuring committee to organize and host restructuring conventions, forums set up for the student body to share its input on GUSA. These meetings will ensure the student body can actively participate and voice its concerns, according to Daniella Sanchez.  
“We want the students to be involved in the planning process. And we want them to be transparent, communicative of what we’re thinking, what direction we’re going in, what’s happening with that, and so the restructuring committee that we’re proposing would host these to do just that,” Daniella Sanchez said during the debate. “To do what we expect the administration to do, we’re also going to be doing it.”
Sanchez and Arnett’s restructuring process also includes disbanding the GUSA Senate, creating a new funding process for the Council of Advisory Boards and drafting a new governing document, according to the ticket’s campaign website.
Regardless of the election’s results, both candidates are hopeful for GUSA’s future.
This year’s election marks, to Sanchez’s knowledge, one of the first times two women of color have run for GUSA president, a stride for diverse representation in GUSA leadership.
“I just also want to acknowledge that I am pretty sure that this is one of the first times ever that two women of color are leading both candidacies as the president,” Daniella Sanchez said. “No matter who wins, the student body is going in a really great direction, and so is GUSA.” 
Polls will be open Feb. 25 at 10 p.m. EST and will close Feb. 27 at 11:59 p.m. EST.

The lack of diversity among senior White House staff has created a challenging environment for Black staffers, according to a panel of Black former White House staffers in an online Zoom event Feb. 23.
The event, titled “Black in the White House,” was co-sponsored by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and The Blaxa, a campus media organization that focuses on amplifying Black voices at Georgetown. The panel featured Ron Christie, Marlon Marshall (GRD ’19), Minyon Moore and Jona Van Deun, all former White House staffers, and it was moderated by Juana Summers, a political reporter for National Public Radio.
Panelists discussed their past experiences as some of the few Black staffers working in the White House. There is a noticeable lack of diversity in the White House, according to Van Deun, who formerly served as the director of scheduling and advance to second lady Lynne Cheney.
“I was so excited to be there and wanted to do the best I possibly could and bring as many people along as I can,” Van Deun said at the event. “There really aren’t a lot of people like me, Black, conservative, republican women. I couldn’t think of one.”
Presidential administrations have a long history of sidelining Black Americans from the work of political staff in the White House. In 1955, Everett Frederic Morrow became the first Black man to hold an executive position on a president’s staff. More recently, former President Donald Trump’s administration faced criticism in 2018 for having zero Black staffers serving in senior positions.
Due to the lack of Black representation within the White House, Black viewpoints are often tokenized, according to Christie, who was a special assistant to former President George W. Bush.
“All Black people do not have this monolithic experience,” Christie said at the event. “You can’t effectively govern as the president or the vice president unless you recognize that there are more voices to be heard.”
Black staffers often feel pressure to stay silent on issues for which they are not directly responsible, especially because their voices are often marginalized and tokenized, according to Moore, who served as an assistant to former President Bill Clinton.
“When I worked at the White House, there were a lot of times when you walk in those rooms when you really just don’t feel like saying anything,” Moore said at the event. “But there is never a time where you should be silent when you know that it is going to impact people, not just people of color, but it could be poor people, white people, but if it’s going to impact them then you have to be willing to speak up.”
President Joe Biden’s senior staff includes several people of color and women. Although diversity and inclusion have historically been an issue within the White House, seeing more Black staffers in future administrations at the White House is necessary to inspire young Black Americans interested in politics to pursue a career at the White House, according to panelists.
Despite the challenges of working as a Black staffer in the White House, it was still an honor to serve the country, according to Christie.
“There is truly, regardless of your skin color, regardless of your gender, no greater privilege than to serve your country and have the opportunity to work and service in a cause that’s greater than yourself,” Christie said.

Georgetown University students are working to combat food insecurity within the university community by implementing a new program to provide resources to graduate and undergraduate students living in the Washington, D.C. area amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Students Advancing Food Equity, an undergraduate student group seeking to alleviate food insecurity in the Georgetown community, launched the Georgetown Neighborhood Food Rescue Service on Feb. 16. The program allows any graduate or undergraduate student living on or off campus to request a food delivery from SAFE. Food is collected from local restaurants and businesses that have excess products, according to Madison Dyer (NHS ’22), president of SAFE.
This semester, SAFE is focusing more of its efforts on off-campus students as students living on campus have access to Georgetown dining options, according to Dyer. 
“Luckily Georgetown has done a really great job of supporting the students on campus this semester. As a result, SAFE is trying to switch gears to try and support kids off campus,” Dyer said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya.
This semester, the university required all students living on campus to purchase an All-Access meal plan, which includes unlimited meal swipes at Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall. The Corp has also reopened two locations, offering more food and grocery options to students living on campus. 
While SAFE is allocating more resources to students living off campus, on-campus students also benefit significantly from SAFE’s new program, according to Christina Ruder (SFS ’23), who lives on campus.
“SAFE’s new Neighborhood Rescue program ensures a steady food source for students on campus during these winter months,” Ruder wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Students who typically find it difficult to prepare meals themselves will be provided meals at no-cost. Students can save money and eat better.”
SAFE, which was founded in 2019, has primarily worked with the Hoya Hub, an on-campus pantry offering free, non-perishable food and personal hygiene items to Georgetown community members. 
While the Hoya Hub and SAFE are separate organizations, many of SAFE’s food collections are used to continually restock the Hoya Hub pantry, so students in need always have nutritious options available to them. 
SAFE has recently expanded its services during the COVID-19 pandemic to include Neighborhood Food Rescues. The program offers students in the D.C. area free food delivery from SAFE. Food is donated by local restaurants or businesses and re-distributed among the Georgetown community, according to Dyer.
“Over the last year, we have become such a prominent effort in the D.C. area,” Dyer said. “Local restaurants have started reaching out to us to donate their extra goods.” 
Levain Bakery and Boulangerie Christophe have both actively contacted SAFE members and notified them about extra food or meals SAFE has distributed to students through Neighborhood Food Rescues, according to Dyer.
To request a Food Rescue, SAFE asks students to fill out an anonymous electronic form detailing their current address and dietary needs, and members will deliver food to their doorstep, according to Dyer.
A 2016 survey conducted by the Georgetown University Student Association found that 54% of 351 students surveyed experienced food insecurity on campus at least once a week.
The university continues to support and assist students struggling with food insecurity, according to a university spokesperson.
“Georgetown is committed to supporting students with food insecurity and the University meets the full needs of students who require financial assistance paying for college, including tuition, housing and meal expenses,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “For the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic Georgetown has supported students with housing and food insecurity on campus.”
Georgetown has moved the Hoya Hub food pantry to the Village A Community Room kitchen to make it more accessible to on-campus students and has facilitated the “Swipe Out Hunger” program, the Georgetown chapter of a national initiative aiming to end food insecurity, according to the spokesperson.
However, students experiencing food insecurity still need more support and SAFE fills that gap. In addition to organizing Food Rescues, SAFE also raises awareness about food-related and nutrition issues, according to Julianne Licamele (COL ’21), one of SAFE’s founders.
“We created SAFE with the goal of supporting the Hoya Hub’s mission on a larger level while also addressing other aspects of food insecurity,” Licamele wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Part of the mission of SAFE is to run programming to spread awareness.”
SAFE shares statistics about food insecurity and nutrition, recipes and information about the organization’s operations through social media, according to Licamele.
“On a basic level, this program has not only provided resources for students who are food insecure, but has spread awareness that these students exist in the first place,” Licamele wrote. “I could not be prouder of where the project has ended up.”

Amid the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic, Marcia Chatelain, professor of history and African American studies at Georgetown University, decided to start subscribing to newsletters, both to support projects of friends and to broaden her knowledge. 
As the lockdown continued and Chatelain was stuck at home teaching through a Zoom screen, she had an idea — to start a newsletter of her own.  
So she did. 
Chatelain’s newsletter, titled “Your Favorite Prof,” launched Jan. 29 and combines her three favorite things: fast-food history, good teaching and lifelong learning. The newsletters range in subject and are filled with wit, with headlines like “Winner! Winner! Chicken Dinner!: Or How the Nuggets are Made” and “Whatever the Hell I Want: Or, What Exactly Are You Going To Do With a History Major.” 
Chatelain said launching the newsletter was a way to cope with a loss of normalcy during the pandemic.
“The thing that I miss the most about the before times is being able to travel places and just connect or reconnect with people, and so I started the newsletter to kind of fill that void,” Chatelain said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
The newsletter is an opportunity to share ideas she hadn’t had a chance to before, according to Chatelain. 
“I really like trying to take some of the research I’ve collected over the years that I haven’t been able to find a place for — you know, not in my book and not in podcasts — and just want to share my interests with people,” Chatelain said. “For me, it’s always important to experiment with different types of form, and this is just a new way of doing that.”
Subscribers to “Your Favorite Prof” can choose between free content, which is delivered twice a month, and a paid weekly subscription, which costs $5 a month, according to Chatelain. 
Chatelain has published content in other mediums, including her book “Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America,” which came out January 2020. The book is a product of Chatelain’s lifelong interest in fast-food history. Her long-standing fascination brought about a historical investigation on the expansion of McDonald’s in Black communities during the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the role of Black capitalists in the aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in 1968. 
Chatelain’s ability to intertwine historical anecdotes with teaching advice makes the content appealing to a wide range of readers, according to Emily Norweg (GRD ’21), a fifth-year doctoral candidate and Chatelain’s graduate research assistant and dissertation advisee.
“Like everything else professor Chatelain does, it is simultaneously somehow hilarious and also incredibly informative,” Norweg said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “People must know that she has an amazing sense of humor, and it comes across in the newsletter.”
In one of Chatelain’s newsletters, “Hail to the Drive Thru: Or, Fast Food in the White House and Teaching Thomas Jefferson,” she examines the relationship between former President Bill Clinton and fast food chains like McDonalds. 
“For Clinton, his presence at McDonald’s placed him in that sweet spot of relatable and in-touch with the everyday American person,” Chatelain wrote in the newsletter. “The message was clear: Regular people eat fast food and it was time a regular person was in the White House (regular meaning attended Georgetown University, Oxford University on a Rhodes Scholarship, Yale Law School, and elected the second youngest governor in your state’s history).”
Chatelain manages to take complicated topics of history and translate them into manageable and captivating pieces of scholarship, according to Norweg.
“She makes a connection with people, and they become really invested in her work,” Norweg said. “And that’s not easy to do because a lot of time people think history is boring and dead and there’s nothing to be learned from it unless you’re already someone who’s invested in it, but she manages to get people interested and invested who wouldn’t necessarily be otherwise.”
Working during the pandemic, whether that be teaching or starting a new kind of project, has required flexibility and openness to the possibility that plans are always subject to change, Chatelain said. 
“I just want to say that I’ve been so really moved by how much students have really stuck in there with me as I’ve tried to teach virtually, but also just how much students have cared for their learning and stayed invested in their learning under these really difficult circumstances,” she said.

Thank you for sharing your experience during the pandemic. I never thought it would be so hard to work from home, but after the last world events happened, I realized that working from home is not as constant a holiday as I thought. Now I realize how difficult it is to be at work and at home at the same time. Although I used to consider this to be the best conditions. Therefore, I adore those people who, in addition to their main work, were able to be passionate about something. This is wonderful and amazing! A wonderful example of a strong-willed person. I would like to be inspired by such a story and take fate into my own hands.
