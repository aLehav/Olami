Georgetown is creating a new Summer Institute in Law and Practice, a ten-week program for matriculated undergraduate students to deeply explore legal studies and practice.
The institute, which the Office of the Provost announced in a March 21 email to the school community, targets students who are interested in the field of law. It includes three components aimed at creating a holistic experience for participants to learn about the various pathways within the legal field through coursework, research and experience. 
Program Director and Georgetown Government Professor Joseph Hartman said he developed the program with many of his own students and his prior experiences as a lawyer in mind.
“I thought maybe we could do something where we combine the academic work with more real-world experience from professionals who do this and have done it for a long time at a high level,” Hartman told The Hoya. “The idea was to give students a much better perspective on what practicing law looks like in various areas. I certainly didn’t have that as an undergrad.”
Hartman said the program aims to increase the accessibility of knowledge about law school and legal careers.
“I just have so many students who are interested in law, but maybe they’re first generation, maybe they don’t know any lawyers, maybe everybody in their family is medical or something else,” Hartman said. “It’s a chance to close the information gap significantly.”
Students will take four courses that are also offered during the regular school year: International Law, Constitutional Law I, Constitutional Law II and Law Practicum. These courses are often among the most competitive to get into during course selection in the regular school year, according to Hartman.
Beyond their course load, the research component requires each student to write a long-term research paper on their topic of choice within legal scholarship, while the experience component will give students the opportunity to engage with legal professionals.
Hartman said that in addition to attorneys, judges and law firm partners, he plans to bring in practitioners who demonstrate the broad diversity of careers within law.
“I want to get people who maybe have law degrees, but they’re not necessarily full-time lawyers,” Hartman said. “We’re trying to give a wide range.”
Hartman said some of these speakers will include experts from a technology business, an entertainment company and national security initiatives.
Ananya Shah (SFS ’25) is planning to apply to the Summer Institute and said the combination of research and practical experience offered by the program appealed to her.
“It’s exciting to have a program where you’re introduced to that and you’re taught more about how to engage in research, coming from the writing and reading perspective,” Shah told The Hoya. “I think a lot of the time when I think of research, I think of data and STEM.”
Shah said she would enjoy building skills for her academic and professional career, such as writing, analyzing case law and understanding international affairs, through the Institute.
“It would help in general for any internships that deal with international affairs and understanding the political arena and the politics of how laws have been put into practice, how they’re written and how that affects their execution,” Shah said. “I think there’s also a lot of working together with other people with the experiential learning component.”
The program will accept 25 students this year, and Hartman said this small cohort will provide each student with the opportunity to engage with all of the institute’s resources.
“Everyone will have a chance to interact fairly directly with guests, whether it’s judges or private practitioners,” Hartman said. 
But Hartman said he can envision the maximum enrollment expanding in future years.
The total cost of the program is $23,700, including housing and dining fees, according to the institute’s webpage. All students will receive a minimum stipend of $6,000 applied to their account balances.
The institute is accepting applications until April 7. Applicants must have a GPA of 3.0 or higher, write a short statement of interest and provide a professor reference.
A spokesperson for the university said the program’s three components will allow students to earn course credit as well as professional experience.
“Students will receive all 12-credits, a certificate of completion, and will gain a firsthand understanding of what it means to study and practice law in Washington, D.C. at the highest level,” according to a university statement. “Students will be well-equipped to decide whether pursuing a law degree is in their future.”
Hartman said his goal is not to convince students to attend law school but rather to give them a fuller understanding of its implications through the Institute.
“It’s a crash course in public law,” Hartman said. “I do not attempt to persuade or dissuade students from law school or being a lawyer. I want to inform you so that whatever decision you make, you feel like you’ve gotten enough information to make a good choice. If you want to take a deep dive, this is a really good opportunity.”

Content creators rallied outside of the U.S. Capitol on March 22 in response to congressional talks of banning TikTok, a popular China-based social media application with over 1 billion users.
Congressman Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) organized a press conference with more than 20 social media content creators, including Naomi Hearts, Aidan Kohn-Murphy, founder of GenZforChange, and V Spehar to protest the possible TikTok ban. The content creators, whose combined digital following comprises over 60 million people, shared at the conference how the app has positively impacted their lives, small businesses and communities. 
Bowman said banning TikTok will not solve the app’s underlying data and privacy issues.
“The rush to ban TikTok sets a dangerous precedent for our country by undermining our freedom of speech and distracts from the real issue: protecting Americans’ data and privacy,” Bowman said in a March 22 press release.
Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) introduced on March 7 the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT) Act, which allows the federal government to regulate technology and applications that countries posing a national security threat produce. These nations, which the legislation dubs “foreign adversaries,” include China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Venezuela.
Meg Leta Jones, associate professor in the Communication, Culture & Technology Program at Georgetown University, a Masters of Arts degree focusing on the impact of technology on society, said conversations about the Tiktok ban stem from several concerns such as the app’s addictive nature, security concerns and international competition in the American technology sector.
A 2022 Pew Research Center study reported that 67% of U.S. teens have used TikTok and 16% of all teens say they use it almost constantly. Additionally, more than 150 million Americans, including 5 million U.S. small businesses, are on TikTok, according to the Bowman press release.
Bowman said the government needs to create all-encompassing regulations rather than banning one app and infringing on free speech rights.
“I, along with millions of others, use TikTok as a place to interact with my community in a positive, uplifting way,” the press release reads. “But this is not about defending TikTok as a company. We need strong regulation that applies to every platform in order to protect our data and especially our children. And we also have to protect young people’s right to free expression.”
Jones said there are many ways in which TikTok influences Americans.
“If the Chinese government is (or can become) involved in either the data collection or content delivery side, U.S. policymakers are concerned about everything from blackmail of U.S. officials to subtle anti-American messaging through influencers, hashtags, and imagery,” Jones wrote to The Hoya.
A bill to ban TikTok from government devices passed on Dec. 14, 2022 and remains in effect. Jones said other countries have begun to ban the app, and it is possible the United States will follow.
“Other countries like India have already banned TikTok and users turn to Reels,” Jones wrote. “Because there are only two mobile operating systems (Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS) with their own app stores for getting programs on phones, making an app illegal makes it fairly inaccessible because those two major tech companies will comply with U.S. law.”
Jones also said that a TikTok ban in the United States would go against certain American principles.
“The first is an open market global trade policy principle, which China has already complicated significantly, having long banned American tech companies like Google and Facebook,” Jones wrote. “The second is open access to information and expression. I’m not a First Amendment scholar, and there are surprisingly diverse opinions about whether a TikTok ban would violate the Constitution.”
Jones said that while it seems unlikely, if the ban were to pass, it would be influential in changing American society.
“TikTok’s massive popularity makes a ban seem unimaginable, but it reminds me of when a series of copyright cases swiftly demolished peer-to-peer music sharing in the early 2000s,” Jones wrote. “Apple made iTunes, and we all survived, but it was a pivotal moment in the history of music and technology. Banning TikTok and the regulation of social media across U.S. states may be a pivotal moment too.”

Georgetown University accepted 13% of applicants for the undergraduate Class of 2027, a one percentage point increase from the Class of 2026.
The university admitted 3,263 students out of 25,519 total applicants, which is 1,151 fewer applicants than last year. 
The College of Arts & Sciences saw the highest number of applicants, receiving 15,484 applications and admitting 1,911 for a 12.3% acceptance rate; the School of Foreign Service (SFS) received 3,817 applications and admitted 15%; the McDonough School of Business had a 12% acceptance rate with 4,210 applicants; the School of Health had 1,542 applicants and accepted 180 students, an 11.7% acceptance rate; and the School of Nursing had 466 applicants and accepted 16.1% of them.
Melissa Costanzi (I ’95), director of undergraduate admissions, said the total number of applicants has remained steady after a 30% increase in 2021. This was also the first year that prospective students could apply to the new School of Health or the School of Nursing.
“More applicants applied to the newly separated schools this year than did to the School of Nursing and Health Studies last year,” Costanzi wrote to The Hoya.
Costanzi said the number of applicants increased in several specific fields.
“The applicant pool continues to become more competitive in the sciences, particularly Biology, in the College of Arts and Sciences and for students applying to the McDonough School of Business,” Costanzi wrote.
The university admitted students from all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Admitted international students came from 94 different countries, according to Costanzi.
Scott Barge, associate vice president for institutional data analytics in the Office of Assessment and Decision Support, said more than half of the admitted Class of 2027 are students of color.
Fifty-three percent of the current Class of 2027 identifies as Black, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, according to Barge.
Despite a wave of colleges choosing to go test-optional after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Georgetown still requires applicants to submit standardized test scores. For admitted students in the Class of 2027, mid-percentile ranges for the SAT were 720 to 770 for the verbal section and 720 to 790 for the math section. On the ACT, admitted students in the 25th through 75th percentile scored in the 32 to 35 range.
Jack Flanigan, accepted to the SFS for the Class of 2027 and a current high school senior in New York City, received an early action acceptance letter in December. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions announced early action acceptances Dec. 15, admitting 965 students in the early round.
Flanigan said he attended the welcome weekend hosted by the Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program (GAAP) from March 24 to 25.
“I applied to Georgetown because of its unrivaled foreign studies program and its Jesuit identity,” Flanigan wrote to The Hoya. “GAAP weekend was an awesome showcase of the university’s people and programs and it was super exciting to get to meet future and present Hoyas in person.”
Costanzi said more students have been visiting campus in comparison to previous years, as the pandemic impacted travel. 
Evelyn Slatoff (CAS ’27), a current high school senior from New Canaan, Conn., was accepted into Georgetown in the early action round.
Slatoff, who has committed to Georgetown, said she is excited for the campus environment and opportunities that Georgetown provides. 
“I applied to Georgetown because when I visited I loved the motivated energy on campus,” Slatoff wrote to The Hoya. “There seems to always be something going on and the university is unmatched in the unique experiences it constantly offers to students.”

CW: This article references/discusses gun violence. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources. 
U.S. Capitol Police arrested the father of one of the victims of the 2018 Parkland, Fla. shooting for interrupting a congressional hearing on gun regulations on March 23. 
Manuel Oliver’s 17-year-old son, Joaquin Oliver, was one of the 17 students and teachers killed in a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018. Oliver testified in court during the shooter’s trial, where the perpetrator was sentenced to life imprisonment in November 2022. 
Oliver founded Change the Ref, an organization for young people to raise awareness about the consequences of gun violence and advocate for stricter gun regulation laws. Oliver and his wife, Patricia Oliver, also participated in a joint lobby day led by anti-gun violence organizations Newtown Action Alliance and Team Enough.
The groups collaborated to attend a joint congressional hearing of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs and the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Federal Government Surveillance, titled “ATF’s Assault on the Second Amendment: When is Enough Enough?” The purpose of the hearing was to discuss whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ limiting of firearms under the Biden administration infringed on the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms. At the hearing, Rep. Pat Fallon (R-Texas) argued that guns should not be banned in the United States. He said that Mexico’s strict laws, which require gun registration, fail to reduce the number of citizens who have guns. 
Patricia Oliver said Fallon’s comments distressed her, and she yelled at Fallon during the hearing, accusing him of taking her son away from her.
Fallon subsequently requested for the police to remove Patricia and Manuel for their disruption of the hearing. Manuel addressed the room as officials led him away.
“We are using our First Amendment right,” Patricia Oliver said as she was escorted out of the hearing room. 
Soraya Bata (SFS ’24), a member of Team Enough and Georgetown March For Our Lives, another student-led group promoting gun control, grew up an hour and half from Marjory Stoneman Douglas.
Bata said that on lobby days like last Thursday, student activists spend all day in meetings with various members of U.S. Congress to urge them to pass the Federal Assault Weapons Ban or regulate gun trafficking.
“The purpose of the organization is to empower young people to take political and legislative action to fight gun violence,” Bata told The Hoya. “There are infinite reasons why lawmakers need to do better, and we need to hold them accountable.”
Bata missed the interruption herself, but was present at the end of the hearing and said it is understandable that Manuel voiced his opinion, especially since he was defending his wife after Fallon asked to remove her. 
“Based on what happened factually, Oliver had a right to speak up the way he did,” Bata said. “He was existing as a grieving father, and it’s cruel to ask him to sit there silently as the anti-gun regulation representatives said gun violence was not an issue in the U.S.”
Fallon continued the hearing after likening the Olivers’ outburst to the Jan. 6 insurrection and calling Manuel a narcissist for disrupting the hearing.
Bystanders protested his removal and said Manuel was not being violent, though several police officers restrained him on the floor outside the hearing room. The police informed him that he would be arrested if he did not cease talking, according to the Washington, D.C. police’s statement. Capitol Police subsequently arrested him.
Jackson Mittleman (CAS ’23), the federal affairs manager of the Newtown Action Alliance who was in attendance alongside other Georgetown students, is a Newtown, Conn. native who was 11 years old when the Sandy Hook shooter killed a family friend’s son. He joined the group when his best friend’s mother founded it after the 2012 shooting and has organized and attended many of their lobbying events since.
Mittleman, who spent time with Manuel Oliver after his arrest, was frustrated at the hearing’s turn of events and with Manuel’s treatment.
“He was used very disrespectfully as a prop for the GOP,” Mittleman said.
Bata said there is a need for more humanity in politics.
“We have a social and civic duty to show empathy and to respect grieving parents,” Bata said. “The politicians being so cruel forgot the feelings of people who lost their son due to preventable gun violence.”
Mittleman said advocacy groups were able to influence Republican politicians to call for more legal action against gun rights, but only after Monday’s Nashville elementary school shooting killed three children and three adults. 
“One of the most frustrating parts of all of it is that we keep telling the GOP lawmakers that something like this is going to happen, and then they’re all up in arms about it after,” Mittleman said. “We need to be more proactive than reactive.”

National Public Radio (NPR) journalist Ayesha Rascoe’s newest pursuit started with a simple question: “Where are these stories?”
Rascoe leads an NPR series titled “The Civil Rights Generation,” where she interviews lesser-known guests about their experiences during the U.S. civil rights movement of the mid-20th century. She joined Eugene Scott, a 2018 Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Fellow, in a March 28 conversation hosted by GU Politics, an academic center devoted to preparing students for careers in public service, and the Georgetown Journalism Program.
Rascoe said her series emerged from a desire to explore the stories of those involved in the civil rights movement who never had a chance to share or record what they witnessed — the unnamed figures who hold untold but important stories. 
“Sometimes you lose the humanity of these people,” Rascoe said at the event. “And the civil rights movement, what made it so powerful, is that it wasn’t just these very prominent people, but it was everyday people who were standing up and doing their part.”
Rascoe said that for many who lived through the staunch segregation and discrimination that marked the mid-20th century, it may be difficult to talk about the trauma they experienced. In 1970, when a black man was killed outside a store in downtown Oxford, N.C., the murderers were never charged. 
Despite this, she was able to sit down and interview her own family members, primarily her mother and uncle, and said she learned many new things about their lived experiences.
Rascoe and her family grew up in Oxford, N.C. When her uncle was a child, he was one of the Black children integrating into a previously all-white school amid bomb threats. Even after integration, he rode on a segregated bus. 
Addison Goodman (COL ’24), who attended the event, has aunts and uncles who went to segregated schools in Tallahassee, Fla., a hotbed for racial violence during the civil rights movement. 
“They never, ever talk about it unless me, who’s very interested, asks,” Goodman told The Hoya. “I always think of my grandma and my great aunt who had passed away, and I always think of how all those stories are lost, but not really, because my parents and their older siblings lived through all that.” 
Although time has passed, Rascoe said the vestiges of racism are hard to wash away. Her own homecoming court was segregated, and her grandmother, who grew up in North Carolina and later moved to New Jersey, said trauma from her past impacts her to this day. 
“If you said something to the wrong person, they would kill you,” Rascoe told The Hoya. “You could just tell, even in her 80s, it was so fresh in her mind. Like that you cannot do these things, like this was not a game. This was life or death. That doesn’t leave you.” 
Scott spoke about the implications of recent efforts to censor the history of the civil rights movement, namely through the Parental Bill of Rights, legislation that recently passed the U.S. House that would enable banning books related to the movement.
“We never fully can tell just how inhumane this period of our country’s history was,” Scott said at the event. “And we risk even losing the most sanitized versions of these stories because of these book bannings.”
Rascoe said that while she doesn’t interview those who fought against the civil rights movement, these are also stories that need to be told in order to better understand the brutality of what occurred.
“I do think that one of the big problems is that you hear these stories about the civil rights era and what happened, and then it’s almost as if everyone who’s doing the oppressing, the earth swallowed them up, and they’re never heard from again,” Rascoe said. 
Rascoe and Scott also discussed how the journalism industry has changed for Black writers in the last decade. 
“I don’t know that Black journalists 10 years before us had the freedom to speak this openly about racism being bad,” Scott said.
Rascoe’s series is ongoing; she still has a few stories left to tell. 
“We have a fight right now over the history that we’re being told, and so I think it’s just more important than ever that as many outlets and books and podcasts as possible just set the record straight and make a record so that somebody can find it somewhere. Because they may not get it in the classroom,” Rascoe said.

Simone Woung (LAW ’97), an assistant dean and registrar at Georgetown University Law School, died peacefully in her sleep surrounded by family March 17. She was 51. 
Woung was born in Kingston, Jamaica and lived on the island as a child before attending the University of Miami. 
Woung worked alongside students and faculty at Georgetown Law for over two decades, first in Residence Life and Financial Affairs then moving to the Office of the Registrar in 2000. She temporarily left Georgetown to work as the registrar at Marymount University in 2015, then returned to Georgetown Law in 2018 as an assistant dean and registrar. 
Woung also served on numerous university and law center committees and sat on the board of directors for the National Network of Law School Officers, a professional development organization for law school officers. 
As Woung’s family mourns such a sudden loss, they know Woung’s legacy will last lifetimes, according to Woung’s mother, Lois Woung. 
“We will miss Simone very much because she was taken from us suddenly but her memories will live long in our hearts,” Lois wrote in a tribute. “Everyone will always remember Simone as the ray of sunshine that brightened our lives and made a difference to everyone that touched her life. May she Rest In Peace.”
Woung touched the Georgetown Law community deeply, according to Georgetown Law professor Hope Babcock.
“Her gentleness calmed down and defused even the most tense situations,” Babcock wrote to The Hoya. “I shall miss her smile and seeing her in her office — her door was invariably open; she hid behind nothing. Knowing Simone was ‘in’ made everything somehow alright. There will be other registrars I know, but none like Simone, and we will be the poor because of her absence. Her loss is devastating for us.”
Ellis Duncan (LLM ’06), a Georgetown Law professor and director of the graduate tax program, met Woung in December 2011 and said she had an understanding of the importance of diversity and inability to bring light even to the most challenging situations. 
“Even in the most extraordinary circumstances, the two of us were able to find some humor in the circumstances that helped us understand that life was bigger than whatever emergency situation we were encountering here,” Duncan wrote to The Hoya. 
“It was important to maintain a certain sense of humor about things because some of the situations could really affect us emotionally, physically,” Duncan wrote. 
Paul Ohm, an associate dean, law professor and chief data officer at Georgetown University, said he worked closely with Woung. He wrote a tribute to her, which he shared with Georgetown Law faculty and staff. 
“She was fiercely protective of everybody she was charged to protect — and many she was not,” Ohm wrote in the tribute. “She advocated forcefully for the staff in her office, the students, and the staff in other offices. She was always willing to speak truth to power — sometimes a little too frankly — but only when she thought the situation demanded it.”
Anne Marie Miller (LAW ’24), a transfer law student who met Woung late last year, said the support she received from Woung was integral in her transition to campus, especially as she dealt with a family emergency.
“Simone was incredibly compassionate as I cried in her office (completely unexpectedly) while sharing about the last year and a half my father (and family) has struggled since he had a massive stroke in May 2021,” Miller wrote to The Hoya. 
“I am extremely grateful to her for helping me have that time with him, and for her compassionate ear as a new transfer student in an unfamiliar campus dealing with intense personal things.” Miller added. 
Woung met her best friend and future husband, Carl Binns, on Valentine’s Day in 2004 at Georgetown, according to the tribute. Together, they have one child, Taylor Eliane, their nine-year-old daughter, who was one of the greatest joys in Woung’s life.
Carol Walsh, who described herself as a longtime friend of Woung, said she cherished the opportunity to spend decades alongside her friend Simone, from college years to the birth of her daughter.
“Our years together at Georgetown were one of the highlights of my life,” Walsh wrote on the tribute page. “But I also got to be a witness to Simone’s life when she ‘grew up.’ You cannot imagine how wonderful and rewarding it was to see Simone get married, settle down, and have a family. No one deserved that happiness more.”
Woung is survived by Carl, Lois, Taylor, her father Maurice Woung, brother Andi Woung and sister Marguerite Woung-Chapman, as well as her brothers-in-law, nieces, cousins, aunts and uncles.

Nancy Pelosi (H ’02), the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, explored the interplay between her personal faith and political career with Georgetown University students March 23.
The Center on Faith and Justice — an institute that advocates for the integration of religious values into the building of an equitable, multiracial democracy — held the event as the first in a series entitled “Higher Calling,” which centers on the role faith plays in political leaders’ lives and careers. Rev. Jim Wallis, the center’s director, hosted the talk.
First elected to Congress in a 1987 special election, Pelosi has represented San Francisco in the House for over 35 years. She became the first female Speaker of the House in 2007, serving until 2011 and then again from 2019 to 2023. 
Pelosi began the event by discussing her upbringing in Baltimore where her Italian American parents raised her to see public service and respect as responsibilities brought upon them by their Catholic faith.
“It was always about helping other people,” Pelosi said at the event. “We were always, always, always told, just by example, knowing that you had to treat people with great respect. We’re all God’s children, and whatever our differences are, you have to be treated with respect, and that there’s a spark of divinity in every person.”
Pelosi’s political views have often come into conflict with Catholic doctrine, such as when Salvatore Cordileone, the Archbishop of San Francisco, blocked her from receiving communion in May 2022 after Pelosi spoke out in support of protecting abortion rights through legislation.
Criticizing Cordileone, Pelosi highlighted transgender rights and abortion as issues where her politics and interpretation of faith have been incorrectly accused of contradicting doctrine. 
Pelosi said her interpretation of Catholicism allows everyone to have autonomy in choosing their own path without undue restriction. 
“All God’s children — they have their own dignity and worth, their own individuality, their own authenticity. And that’s a beautiful thing for us to embrace, all God’s creation. We have a free will. God has given us a free will. And we have a moral responsibility to live up to that response, that free will,” Pelosi said. 
Pelosi said religious faith has given her and others the gift of hope, and that hope pushed her through the personal hardship of recovering from the attempted murder of her husband, Paul Pelosi (SFS ’62), in October 2022.
“When people ask me, ‘Where is hope? Why shouldn’t we give up?’ I’ll say, hope is where it has always been, sitting comfortably between faith and charity,” Pelosi said. “People have faith in the goodness of others. That gives them hope. So faith was key to all of it.”
In the wake of increasing violence against public servants, including the attack on her husband, Pelosi said she often reminds candidates — and herself — of the reasons motivating them to serve in Congress.
“My ‘why’ is one in five children in America is in poverty, goes to sleep hungry at night. What? In the greatest country that ever existed in the history of the world? That’s what took me from the kitchen to the Congress, from housewife to House speaker,” Pelosi said.
Pelosi began her career as one of 23 female representatives in the House. Today, 125 women serve as representatives in the House and 25 as senators in an increasingly diverse Congress — something Pelosi said benefits American government. 
“Nothing is more wholesome in the political process and government or anything — academic world, corporate America, military, security, anything — than the full participation of women in leadership,” Pelosi said. “And I would expand that to say diversity writ large. Not just women, but younger people, people of color.”
Pelosi said two crucial elements contribute to her understanding of the connection between her responsibilities in government and her faith: prioritizing justice in legislation and having personal courage.
“Justice in terms of how we meet the needs of people, justice in listening to how they want their needs met, with having them at the table,” Pelosi said. “The sacrifice of our men and women in uniform for the freedom we have to do what we do, and the aspirations of our children as we listen to all of you as to what you want the future to be. One word makes the difference in all of this, and that is courage.”

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate approved six resolutions at its March 26 meeting aiming to improve GUSA’s inner workings, university mail distribution and increasing student access to Riggs Library, among other issues.
The Senate approved a proposed club-funding budget and passed acts requesting the university administration extend service hours for SafeRides, late-night shuttles to transport students to and from campus; upgrading the user interface and accuracy of NextGUTS, the Georgetown University Transportation Shuttles (GUTS) bus-tracking web app; and opening Riggs Library for study or public visitation hours. 
The Senate also approved an amendment to its bylaws setting up the executive positions of outreach director, engagement director and social and community officer and passed an act setting up a survey and report on university mail services. 
Senator Rhea Iyer (CAS ’26) sponsored the resolution to extend SafeRides service hours. SafeRides are currently available between 8 p.m. and 2 a.m. most weeknights and from 8 p.m. to 3 a.m. weekends and Thursday nights.
Iyer said other local universities, including The George Washington University and American University, provide similar services for longer hours, and proposed extending SafeRides availability to improve student safety during dark winter evenings.
“I propose to extend that service hour time from 6 p.m. to 4 a.m., just as a way to be more safe on the roads,” Iyer said at the meeting. “In daylight savings, I think it gets dark around 5 to 6. So this would ensure that SafeRides that are available when it does get darker in daylight savings.”
Senators George Currie (CAS ’26) and Andrew Wong (SFS ’26) proposed the resolution to upgrade NextGUTS. Wong said NextGUTS is neither accurate at representing bus locations nor user-friendly. 
“This poses a safety concern, especially late at night, when the GUTS bus is a mode of transportation you rely on to get back to campus,” Wong said at the meeting.
GUSA President Camber Vincent (SFS ’24) and Senator Bora Balçay (SFS ’23) introduced the bill to amend the GUSA bylaws, creating the positions of outreach director and engagement director. The outreach director is tasked with collecting student opinions on GUSA projects, and the engagement director will provide opportunities for GUSA members to interact with other students, especially first-years, through a working group.
Vincent said officially creating the first-year working group and adding the engagement director as a permanent chair would promote long-term student engagement across administration changes.
“It cements the freshman working group into the bylaws, which was started this year, under the engagement director, someone whose position does not change over the course of the entire fall semester,” Vincent said at the meeting.
Currie and Wong also introduced a bill to increase student access to Riggs Library, which urges the university to allow students to either study in or simply visit the historic library. Currie said many Georgetown students hope to explore Riggs, especially as the university uses photographs of the library’s interior in many promotional materials.
“They don’t want students to go in, not only coming to study there, but it’s usually locked,” Currie said at the meeting. “The resolution is either institute a lottery or sign up to allow students to study there, or else at least to open it up.” 
A third bill Currie and Wong introduced institutes GUSA oversight of Georgetown Mail Services, with GUSA distributing a semesterly survey to acquire data on Mail Services and urge Georgetown to expand student jobs there.
Students have criticized mail services for delays and miscommunication, according to Wong.
“What this resolution does is just GUSA will do a little research on how the mail service is doing, a little research and maybe find a solution to this,” Wong said at the meeting.
The Senate also considered a resolution which proposed urging the university to set up a permanent memorial for Madeleine Albright, former secretary of state and professor in the School of Foreign Service. After objections from some senators, both political concerns relating to Albright’s record on human rights in Iraq and Serbia, and administrative concerns regarding the difficulty of implementing a permanent memorial, senators voted to table the resolution.
Every proposed bill passed unanimously, with only one abstention from Balçay on the Riggs Library reopening bill.
Balçay commended senators’ work and the culture around GUSA over his four years as a senator, as this was the last meeting in which the class of 2023 senators will participate.
“I’ve been invested for four years now,” Balçay said. “GUSA used to be a very different place. I’m very happy that our working culture now is so much better than the one that I came into.”
