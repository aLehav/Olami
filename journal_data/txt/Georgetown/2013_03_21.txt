A student residence on the 3200 block of N Street N.W. was burglarized early this morning.
According to a Department of Public Safety alert, students discovered around 3:30 a.m. that two unknown males were in their home. The suspects fled the scene when questioned, but it was only later that the victims realized that property had been stolen.
There were no signs of forced entry as the back door to the residence had not been locked.
DPS and the Metropolitan Police Department were notified of the incident.
