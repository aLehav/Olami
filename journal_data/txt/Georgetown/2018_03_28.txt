The annual OWN IT Summit, aimed at empowering and inspiring women personally and professionally, brought over 100 speakers to Georgetown’s campus this weekend to discuss the role of women in politics as well as sexual assault and harassment in the workplace.
This year’s summit aimed to address the #MeToo movement, a hashtag campaign that started in 2017 to share the prevalence of sexual assault and harassment for women in the workplace. The event focused on what the movement means for women entering the workplace and encouraging young women to participate in politics, according to OWN IT 2018 Director of Communications Amanda Shepherd (SFS ’18).
Created in 2014 by Helen Brosnan (COL ’16) and Kendall Ciesemier (COL ’15), the summit is designed to promote intersectional activism, female empowerment and leadership for young women on campus. The event’s founders created OWN IT to address the lack of female leadership in large businesses, according to the event’s information page.
The event featured three panel discussions and two breakout sessions, with each speaker sharing their experiences with gender discrimination, sexual misconduct and activism. Speakers included Maryland gubernatorial candidate Krish Vignarajah, CNN commentator and liberal activist Sally Kohn, press secretary for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign Symone Sanders, American gymnast Mattie Larson, poet Cleo Wade and journalist Amy Brittain.
Deborah Canty (CAS ’78), the first female president of the Georgetown University Student Association, opened the event with a message of motivation as she urged women to continue pursuing leadership positions. Canty said that despite the strength of the #MeToo movement, she hopes that it will continue to push for female empowerment to dismantle a white, male-dominated system.
“The unfortunate truth is that most power is still in the hands of white men, and women are still held to a double standard,” Canty said. “I hope your contributions and your efforts just like so many women before you will result in changing this.”
Canty said it is important that young women speak up and ignore those who might try to silence their voices.
“There are those in society who would like us, women, to be smaller, quieter, diminished,” Canty said. “My advice to you is to be as large as you wish to be.”
OWN IT was originally scheduled for Saturday, March 24. However, members of the organizing team said they decided to move the event to Sunday in a show of solidarity with the March for Our Lives, a student-led rally to protest gun violence in the United States.
Co-Chair of OWN IT Sarah Clements (COL ’18) addressed the summit’s solidarity with the March for Our Lives protest during her opening statement.
“We stand in solidarity with the students in Parkland, Fla., for reminding our generation and every generation of the urgency of this very moment to make change, break down barriers, find solutions and speak out even when it feels impossible,” Clements said. “These are OWN IT values too, and we hope to continue to build on the energy from yesterday’s events.”
Shepherd said that the speakers and vendors were both understanding and accommodating of the date change.
“It was really heartwarming to see how all of our speakers and vendors and all of that were really understanding of the change and really were on board and understood why we made that difficult decision,” Shepherd said.
Two awards were also presented at the summit. The Gwendolyn Mikell Award for Women’s Empowerment, a collaborative effort between the Georgetown Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, a student-run fund for social impact projects, and OWN IT, granted $500 to Rachel Mucha (SFS ’18) for her nonprofit work in India, while poet and author Cleo Wade received the OWN IT Summit Award, also known as the Trailblazer Award, for her powerful and inclusive poetry. Wade was the keynote speaker of the summit, and she discussed her new book “Heart Talk” with OWN IT co-founder Helen Brosnan.
Wade said that she intended her book to help her connect with her audience and overcome pain.
“I really wanted to write something, create something so that I could have a vehicle to get in the room with my audience to really realize the healing that we all needed,” Wade said.
Wade said she wrote her book as an inclusive tool for healing and strived to create a piece of art that would appeal to many different people.
“When I was writing the book, I really did think about it being this really foundational tool, and in that I wanted to make sure that there were a lot of different entry points for people’s healing,” she said.
Wade said that this quest for inclusivity reflects the way that women should try to lead: by empowering voices that are not often as celebrated to speak out.
“Women don’t lead so that their voices can be heard,” Wade said. “We lead so that the voices that aren’t being heard can be heard.”
OWN IT Co-Chair Sienna Mori (COL ’18) said that the OWN IT summit is a step in contributing to the effort to empower women, strengthen female voices and fight gender discrimination in society as a whole.
“The conversations that we have in this room will crack the glass ceiling just a little bit more and bring us just a little further in our fight for equity, access and inclusion,” Mori said.

To help women interested in entering the political arena, leaders should evaluate the structural gender barriers that have historically kept them away, panelists said at the first of three panels at the fifth annual OWN IT Summit on March 25.
The panel, Women Running for Office, included Krish Vignarajah, a Maryland gubernatorial candidate who previously served as policy director for former first lady Michelle Obama. Vignarajah was joined by Amanda Litman, co-founder and executive director of Run for Something, an advocacy body dedicated to helping recruit and support young progressive people running for office. Jessica Byrd, co-founder of Three Point Strategies, a political consulting firm focused on the support of black women running for office, also spoke on the panel.
Jordan Brooks, managing director and chief operating officer of the United State of Women, a national organization that hosts annual summits to amplify women’s voices and promote gender equality, moderated the event.
Reflecting on her work with female political candidates, Byrd said there is insufficient research on structural barriers for women to enter the political sphere.
“The problem isn’t women’s lack of ambition or vision,” Byrd said. “We’re already leading our organizations; we built this conference, we’re leading student movements, we’re leading marches. What’s happening is what I believe to be a lack of structural analysis about what really holds us back.”
There is value in advocating for women, especially women of color, who want to forge political campaigns, according to Vignarajah.
“I didn’t grow up being told time and time again ‘You look like you could be the next governor,’” Vignarajah said. “People are going to say to you, ‘You don’t look the part,’ to which you just say back, ‘This is what the part looks like.’”
Litman, whose organization Run For Something was founded in 2017 to help young, diverse progressives build a democratic bench for the future, said female representation is crucial to inspire the next generation of female leaders.
“To be able to see someone like you and to see them run and win is so powerful,” Litman said. “There’s that expression, ‘You can’t be what you can’t see’: If you don’t see any women running and winning, you won’t think you can do it yourself.”
The current lack of representation should not stop women from trying to shape themselves into models for others, Litman said.
“It doesn’t matter if you don’t see anyone who looks like you, or if anyone has done it before. Be the first,” Litman said. “There is a community of women who will stand with you and help you and support you in a way that will make it one of the best things you could ever do.”
Litman added that women interested in campaigning should use local politics as a launching point to fulfill their larger political ambitions.
“Local governments really make a difference in people’s lives,” Litman said. “Local offices are things you can run for and win because the number of voters you have to talk to is usually pretty manageable.”
Within Three Point Strategies, Byrd has recently been working with the campaign of Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. Abrams hopes to become the first black woman to win the Democratic nomination for Georgian governor, despite the structural obstacles for women of color that have played a large role in the lack of black women in statewide governmental seats, according to Byrd.
“There have been very real structural barriers that have kept black women from achieving statewide positions,” Byrd said. “Part of what that means is that people are actually intentionally blocking the path of really viable, genius black women.”
Women candidates have repeatedly proven themselves ready to lead, according to Vignarajah.
“We’ve seen time and time again that when women lead, we have better health outcomes, better schools, more progressive policies,” Vignarajah said. “That’s why I think people should pay attention to women when they run.”

Issues of intersectional identity and the suppression of women’s voices were at the forefront of the OWN IT panel Speak Up or They Won’t Hear You: Women in Male-Dominated Workplaces, which featured four prominent women in media and activism: Monica Raymund, Abby Stein, Symone Sanders and Sally Kohn, who moderated the event.
Raymund is a television actress best known for her roles on CBS’s “The Good Wife” and NBC’s “Chicago Fire”; Stein is a writer and transgender activist; Sanders is a CNN commentator and former national press secretary for the 2016 presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Kohn is an LGBTQ activist and CNN commentator.
The panel, the second of three at Sunday’s OWN IT Summit, focused largely on the personal experiences of the panelists in their relationships to gender and racial politics.
Stein was raised in a conservative Hasidic Jewish community in New York and worked as a rabbi in her early adulthood, according to CNN. Asked whether she had ever felt voiceless, Stein spoke about her lightbulb moment at age 20.
“I didn’t know gay people existed until 2008. I didn’t know trans people existed until I was 20,” Stein said. “When I was 20 years old, I had no idea, not that I have a voice, but that there was anything to [say].”
Stein also discussed the ability of the media, specifically social media, to silence activists, describing how her use of the hashtag #JewsDemandAction the previous day sparked an anti-Semitic response on her Twitter page.
“All the arguments [were] about all the typical stereotypes of how we’re trying to control the world and how we’re Communists and Bolsheviks. All of that going nonstop,” Stein said. “I’m gonna think twice … next time, before I say anything about my identity, how being queer and Jewish, or being Jewish and an activist, affect me. I was effectively shut down.”
Raymund described her trouble accessing her own voice until she was given the free rein to explore her identity.
“Look, I’m brown, I’m queer, I’m Latina,” Raymund said. “Trying to understand all of those things as my identity was very difficult for me when I was a teenager. I went to school in New York, and that’s where I found a little bit of my voice. So I was lucky, because I had a community, and I had the space. I didn’t understand my power until I was given the space to do that.”
Raymund tied her own experience of empowerment to the outspoken teenage organizers of the  March for Our Lives, the march to protest gun violence that had taken place the previous day.
“When I’m watching these kids march yesterday, for the first time in a while, it feels like there’s hope for the world,” Raymund said.
Sanders discussed the issue of authenticity in professional spaces.
“Do you all know what a ‘work voice’ is? You know this thing,” Sanders asked the audience, raising her voice to a higher pitch, “that you put on to make what you’re saying more palatable, a bit more mainstream, because someone told us that this was more effective in the workplace, or a conference call, or a meeting or in class when you raise your hand?”
Sanders abandoned her “work voice,” she said, in early 2015, when she realized the people around her at work were being their “authentic selves” in the office.
“Finally I said, we’re just gonna show up as Symone today,” Sanders said. “I stopped trying to put up the facade of what I thought was professional, what I thought would work for me in this environment, and be myself.”
Finding her authentic voice was a process, Sanders said, but was worth it.
“The day that I decided to be my authentic self, and to show up as Symone every single place that I went, everything just got better,” Sanders said.

Listening to women’s stories of sexual harassment and assault is critical to dismantle the cultures that enable these behaviors, speakers at the fifth annual OWN IT Summit said during the panel Navigating the #MeToo Movement.
The panel discussion featured Mattie Larson, the U.S. national team gymnast who testified against Larry Nassar, the USA Gymnastics national team doctor who was charged for child molestation, as well as The Washington Post investigative reporter Amy Brittain and Tammy Cho, co-founder and CEO of BetterBrave, an organization that advocates for survivors of sexual harassment.
The event was one of three mainstage panel discussions at the OWN IT Summit, an annual event inaugurated in 2014 to discuss the issues women face in their professional and social lives.
Kendall Ciesemier (COL ’15), one of the co-founders of OWN IT, facilitated the discussion, prompting the panelists to share and reflect on their experiences in the wake of the #MeToo movement, a hashtag campaign that began in 2017 to share the prevalence of sexual assault and harassment in the work place.
The #MeToo movement reached prominence last fall by the rapid fall of several prominent male media figures, including film producer Harvey Weinstein, NBC news host Matt Lauer, and stand-up comedian Louis C.K. — as well as former CBS talk show host Charlie Rose, whose allegations of sexual assault were publicly revealed in a Washington Post story reported by Brittain and her colleague Irin Carmon.
Panelists discussed what the allegations against powerful men will mean in the months, and eventually years, after the initial wave of the movement.
After so many high-profile men were the subject of #MeToo allegations, some question whether sexual misconduct is an issue of a few bad apples or a broader cultural failure, according to Ciesemier.
“We’re not really talking about the cultures that allow them to exist,” Ciesemier said.
This culture, panelists said, is enabled by those who do not question the behavior of abusers and some who help the culture continue. Larson said her experience with Nassar, and those of his other victims, was made possible by adults who failed to question his behavior.
“You’re dealing with such young women,” Larson said about the gymnasts on her team. “When you have huge gaps between power it just makes it so easy for predators to take advantage.”
Panelists said the problems of sexual harassment and assault are compounded when victims face retaliation for speaking out. While founding BetterBrave, an organization that works to empower people by educating them about their workplace rights regarding sexual harassment, Cho interviewed hundreds of people to learn about their experiences with workplace harassment. She said the vast majority of those she interviewed experienced some form of reprisal after disclosing their experiences.
Retaliation or enabling behavior are a common theme through cases of assaul Brittain said.
“In a lot of cases these women did say something, they did speak up to their supervisors and they were told that that’s just Charlie being Charlie,” Brittain said. “Once again, the behavior was normalized.”
While #MeToo grabbed national attention for the powerful men who were accused, the movement could have consequences for a range of industries, Brittain said. She emphasized the work of journalists at The New York Times who investigated the alleged sexual harassment of blue-collar workers in Michigan and ProPublica’s investigation into allegations against the Red Cross.
“These are the women who live next door to us, the women you see in the grocery store and their stories, I believe, fundamentally are just as important as anyone else’s,” Brittain said.
As a journalist, advocate and survivor, Brittain, Cho and Larson respectively have varied backgrounds on hearing and telling these stories. Through their experiences, they emphasized the importance of listening, if someone chooses to reach out.
Larson urged people to first listen if someone reaches out to them with a story of sexual harassment or assault.
“It’s not your place to decide what umbrella their story falls under,” Larson said. “It’s not in your hands to judge them on what you think is right or wrong or what you think is assault or just an uncomfortable situation.”
She also said simply sharing their stories can be empowering for survivors, referencing the opportunity she took to testify at Nassar’s sentencing hearing.
“I couldn’t give myself another opportunity not to use my voice,” Larson said. “I now feel so much stronger.”

For Rachel Mucha (SFS ’18), this year’s recipient of OWN IT’s Gwendolyn Mikell Award for Women’s Empowerment, the India Innovation Studio class was critical to sparking her passion for furthering the financial literacy and education of women.
The India Innovation Studio is a course through Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service in coordination with the government of Maharashtra, India. The goal of the course is for students to design and implement a solution to a development issue that India faces. Mucha received this year’s award for her project focusing on providing financial management and entrepreneurship training to female farmers in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra.
The award, a collaboration between the OWN IT Summit and Georgetown’s own Social and Innovation Public Service Fund, honors a woman for “pursuing a not-for-profit project that in some way relates to social innovation, public service and/or environmental sustainability,” according to the OWN IT website. SIPS, a student-run philanthropic organization that grants $60,000 each year to students conducting social projects, co-sponsors the award.
Mucha, who had been working with SIPS on the project before receiving the award, said she was encouraged to apply for the grant by her SIPS project manager to continue to expand her work.
In an interview with The Hoya, Mucha explained her vision behind the project that led to her receiving the award.
Your project focuses on providing financial management and training to female farmers in India. How did you first get involved with the farming industry?
I don’t have much experience with female farming, but I’m part of the India Initiative at Georgetown. So, I’ve been studying and working on projects related to India throughout the course of this year. In terms of financial literacy for women, as a culture and politics major, my focus has been on global level development solutions that can benefit women. So, microfinance and financial literacy are key to have.
Why did you decide to get involved with the India Initiative?
I started taking a class called the India Innovation Studio last semester, and our focus this year is on public health and sanitation. I didn’t really know a lot about India, but I was interested in applying the public health aspects of the class.
How do you plan to use your grant?
These $500 will allow me to stay an extra week and hopefully implement the workshop in another community. The initial plan was just to do it in one and make a town hall or community center, but hopefully now we can expand it. I’m also planning to design some sort of booklet or curriculum that I can print out and leave as a tool to refer back to.

Do you plan on going to India soon?
I am going in June for three weeks. I am going for a week with my class, two weeks by myself and, depending on what post-grad looks like, I might end up staying on to do some other things with the [India Innovation] Studio.
How do you plan on initiating everything there?
I’m working on a survey that I’m sending to the non-governmental organization I am partnered with. They will distribute the survey within the community so that it can better diagnose and understand where the gaps of financial literacy are for the people I’ll be working with, because they do not want to implement a curriculum that is unnecessary. I also made sure that I am cognizant that women have a lot of domestic or household responsibilities, so if family budgeting or financial managing would be more useful, then I will focus on those. When I get the results of the survey, I am designing a curriculum, and I have done a lot of research on different kinds of digital literacy curriculums. [The class] will be in the evening from eight to 10, after the work day ends.
Do you have an idea of what you think the curriculum might look like?
It depends on the survey results, but right now I am planning to talk a little bit more about digital financial literacy, like how to use online banking or mobile pay apps. I also might end up working on business management skills, like teaching women how to manage their finances from an entrepreneurial perspective, like revenue generation.
What message do you hope to instill in Georgetown students?
Take advantage of the resources on campus. There are a lot of opportunities for funding and travel. I think I am just a lucky beneficiary of the support networks I have, and I am really grateful for OWN IT and the SIPS fund for giving people like me the opportunity to take on projects that we’re interested in.
