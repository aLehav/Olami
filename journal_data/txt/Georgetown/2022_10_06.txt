A U.S. congressman introduced two bills to establish an LGBTQ+ history and culture museum in Washington, D.C. 
Wisconsin Representative Mark Pocan (D), who is openly gay and serves as a co-chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, introduced the bills Sept. 29, two days before the start of LGBTQ+ History Month. The first bill would organize an eight-member commission in the House of Representatives to investigate the feasibility of a National Museum of American LGBTQ+ History and Culture and submit a plan for its construction and maintenance to Congress within the next 18 months. The second bill would officially establish the museum within the Smithsonian Institution. Both bills must be signed into law to create the museum, which is likely to take multiple congressional sessions.
In a press release, Pocan said establishing a national LGBTQ+ museum to honor and remember the community’s history is essential in today’s political climate.
“It is vital to remember our collective past — particularly when certain states seek to constrain and repeal existing rights by passing bills that harm LGBTQ+ youth and our community at large,” the press release read. “Let’s tell these stories, and honor the many contributions the LGBTQ+ community has made to this nation with a museum in Washington, D.C.”
The bills come on the heels of a record number of state legislatures passing anti-LGBTQ+ measures in 2021, according to tracking and analysis by the Human Rights Campaign. Pocan said because of the rise in anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment, it is essential to establish institutions that safeguard against attacks on the LGBTQ+ community.
“As our community faces unprecedented attacks and attempts to erase our history, we must preserve and protect our stories for future generations,” Pocan said in the press release.
April Sizemore-Barber, a professor in the women’s and gender studies program at Georgetown University, said the museum would be a powerful show of national support for LGBTQ+ history as part of American history.
“Whether or not it passes, I think, symbolically, it is necessary that the government or government representatives respond to make visible these histories and affirm them,” Sizemore-Barber told The Hoya.
If the bill does not pass by the end of the current session of Congress, a spokesperson for Pocan told Washingtonian he will reintroduce it in the next session. 50 members of Congress, in addition to all nine openly LGBTQ+ representatives, originally cosponsored the bills. All of the cosponsors are members of the Democratic Party.
Matt Shinnick (COL ’25), who serves as director of social affairs for GU Pride, said it is important to explore different voices within the LGBTQ+ community while highlighting different aspects of queer culture. 
“It would also be great to see an emphasis on the continuing fight for equality many queer people still endure, especially the specific struggles that many LGBTQ+ people of color face, since that’s often overlooked,” Shinnick wrote to The Hoya.
According to Sizemore-Barber, the museum should also focus on the intersectionality of queerness and its links to other identities.
“If you have a singular kind of gay narrative, there is a danger of erasing, of erasure,” Sizemore-Barber said. “Bring in voices. Bring in art. I think that a good museum would look and interrogate the idea of these categories themselves or historicize them. Like what does it mean when we say ‘gay history?’”
This LGBTQ+ history museum would join the National Museum of the American Latino and the American Women’s History Museum as the newest additions to the Smithsonian Institution, which were approved by Congress in 2020 and are estimated to be completed within the next 10 years.
Shinnick said it is important to see increased representation in various communities’ histories and honor them through museums in the District.
“With Women’s history and Latino history museums on the way, it is clear that there’s a strong movement for diversity, and it would be amazing to see queer history be represented,” Shinnick wrote. “D.C. has so many great museums that educate on a diverse array of different topics. However, there has been very little focus on queer history or culture. Having a museum specifically dedicated to it, rather than just temporary exhibits, would be wonderful.”

The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS) co-hosted a closed meeting at the United Nations General Assembly to discuss Afghan women’s rights. 
Girls’ education activist Malala Yousafzai and Foreign Minister of Sweden Ann Linde attended the Sept. 20 meeting, titled “The Role of Feminist Foreign Policy Champions in Securing Women’s Rights in Afghanistan.” Georgetown University students Alara Karahan (SFS ’24) and Nasim Azizi (GRD ’24) also attended the meeting, which covered ways to support women’s education in Afghanistan after the Taliban banned girls from attending high school in March 2022, seven months after taking over the Afghan government.
Azizi, who lived in Afghanistan and advocated for the rights of women and girls there for 13 years, said participants at the meeting discussed ways to convince the Taliban to open schools for girls and ways for girls to continue their education in the meantime.
“The international community is trying to find a way out of these problems because no effective action has been taken so far, and it has been a year since schools were closed for girls,” Azizi wrote to The Hoya. “Universities in the United States and other universities around the world can plan and provide online learning platforms and online programs for Afghan girls and help them continue their education.”
Melanne Verveer, executive director of GIWPS and former U.S. Ambassador for Global Women’s Issues, moderated the event and said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for diplomats to engage in discussion with Afghan women who have been directly impacted by the Taliban’s suppression of women’s education. 
“It was especially moving to have representatives of the Afghan community — both students and NGO leaders — speak directly and passionately to the officials about the need for great action from their governments,” Verveer wrote to The Hoya. 
GIWPS collaborated with the Malala Fund, an organization founded by Yousafzai that supports girls’ education, and the Swedish Mission to the UN, which represents Sweden internationally, to host the meeting. Organizers invited diplomats, leaders in feminist foreign policy and Afghan students to participate in the discussion alongside Yousafzai. 
The meeting followed the Chatham House Rule, where attendees are allowed to use information they gather from the meeting to develop foreign policy in their respective countries but cannot attribute comments to specific people or countries, which Karahan said allowed participants to speak more freely about their opinions and capabilities to assist.
Verveer said participants focused on discussing actionable steps the international community can take to support Afghan women’s rights.
“The discussion was not a lot of speeches, but rather one in which very thoughtful concrete commitments and recommendations were made by the government officials on additional steps — from greater diplomatic engagement, particularly in the region, and further UN actions to eliminating the travel waiver for top Taliban to temporary ways to provide access to education through technology,” Verveer wrote.
The discussion highlighted several challenges that Karahan said she had not previously considered when discussing potential solutions in the context of a classroom.
“Here are the people actually carrying out these plans and talking about its feasibility, its probability and the dangers,” Karahan told The Hoya. “That was the most surprising bit, seeing ‘okay, here’s the discourse in my mind.’ I just saw in real life whether or not that’s even possible.”
It is vital for countries committed to feminist foreign policy to pay particular attention to Afghan women, according to Verveer. 
“Countries that have officially committed to a feminist foreign policy — that is, fully integrated a gender lens in their foreign policy — it seems have an added obligation in their diplomatic work, to be more engaged on Afghanistan,” Verveer wrote. “It is especially important to speak out and adopt concrete actions to support Afghan women’s rights, which are being assaulted by the Taliban.”
Azizi said individuals who want to support girls’ education rights in Afghanistan can donate to USAID, the World Bank, the UN Development Programme, UN Women and UNICEF.
Karahan said Georgetown students have a responsibility to be aware about women’s access to education in Afghanistan. 
“You can take classes, you can talk to professors, you can attend events,” Karahan said. “Georgetown is giving you these resources so that when these conversations come up, you not only have a stake in them, but you’re educated, you have ideas and you can propel the conversation forward.”

Washington, D.C., is experiencing a nursing shortage that is heavily impacting the healthcare system as hospitals struggle to maintain necessary staff levels to care for patients.
The District of Columbia Hospital Association (DCHA) has struggled to retain enough nurses to meet the intense demands of the COVID-19 pandemic, a pattern mirrored in hospitals across the country. While many people have adjusted to living life as they did before the pandemic, nurses remain particularly strained, as the 7-day average of patients in hospital service areas in and around Washington, D.C., hospitalized with COVID-19 in the District sits at 149.
In 2021, more than 100,000 registered nurses left the workforce, the largest drop in the past 40 years. According to a Nurse Staffing Survey published in September by the DCHA, nearly 80% of nurses working in hospitals and facilities in D.C. say they have to deal with staffing shortages more than once per week, placing increased strain on nurses.
Georgetown School of Nursing Associate Professor Diane Davis said nursing shortages in the United States are not solely a result of the pandemic, but that they stem from a larger strain on nurses in the workplace.
“I think it started before that and I think nursing has been running with a nursing shortage for a very long time,” Davis told The Hoya. “I don’t know that there’s ever times where you feel like you’re flushed with nurses. It’s kind of an ongoing problem.”
Prior to COVID-19-related stressors, nurses reported feeling burnout from the strain of long hours, the pressure of quick decision-making that may affect patients’ health, and the strain of caring for patients who may not fully recover. Nurses’ feelings of stress and burnout can be increased by nurses who are forced to care for a larger number of patients, those who work longer hours, and those who specialize in stressful areas of healthcare, such as Emergency Department and ICU nurses.
This nursing shortage does not show signs of easing any time soon. According to research conducted by consulting firm McKinsey & Company on the impact of COVID-19 on the nursing workforce, by 2025, the U.S. could have anywhere from 200,000 to 450,000 fewer registered nurses than necessary to meet patient demand. 
Davis said the School of Nursing at Georgetown prepares future nurses for the challenges they may face in a strained healthcare system. 
“We do a fair amount of work for wellness in nursing and how to take care of yourself and your colleagues and how to set up situations where you work that can promote wellness because nursing can be very difficult,” Davis said. 
Maddie Flynn (SON ’24), a nursing student, said that Georgetown nursing students recognize the issue of the nursing shortage in the workplace.
“Nursing is a highly collaborative field — being surrounded by a cohort of such driven and passionate peers that are supportive in the classroom makes me hopeful for support for our future after we graduate,” Flynn wrote to The Hoya. “We all recognize the high demand of our field, but are inspired by our professors and clinical faculty every day in class and the hospital.”
Flynn said she has seen the impacts of the shortages affecting her clinical rotations at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital (MedStar), a key component of her nursing education at Georgetown, in which students spend time with members of the medical field in a hospital setting.
“We do clinicals at MedStar, and a lot of times we’ll see nurses that are caring for six or more patients, which isn’t typical and while they’re able to manage it, you can tell they’re more stressed out than they would be if there was a better ratio,” Flynn wrote. “I’d say overall the worst part about having a nursing shortage is that you aren’t able to devote time in a more meaningful way to each of your patients.”
Despite challenges, many nurses continue to stay in the field due to their passion for the work, Davis said.
“It’s a very rewarding profession, but it can be a very difficult profession. A lot of people that go into nursing take care of other people, but at the expense of themselves,” Davis said. “But there’s a lot of pressures: work more shifts, work more hours, and fill in for this person so we try to also work with that. They need to take care of themselves as well.”

Five first-year students in the McCourt School of Public Policy have been selected as the 2022 McCourt Scholars, an annual honor recognizing students who show exceptional promise in the field of policymaking.
Announced Sept. 26, the honorees include Kyuin Lee (GRD ’24), Sara Hidayatullah (GRD ’24), Jad Maayah (GRD ’24), Charlotte Bailey (GRD ’24) and Sumin Lee (GRD ’23). Each honoree will receive a full-tuition scholarship, health insurance, a stipend and coverage for mandatory fees. Cohorts are selected based upon the strength of their applications to the McCourt School, where their prior experiences and academic excellence set them apart. 
McCourt School Dean Maria Cancian said this year’s cohort covers a wide range of focuses within policymaking. 
“The McCourt School is proud to honor Charlotte, Jad, Kyuin, Sara and Sumin, whose backgrounds, experiences and academic excellence qualify them for this prestigious award,” Cancian wrote to The Hoya. “This year’s McCourt Scholars have diverse interests in tech, health, immigration, criminal justice and climate resilience, and we look forward to seeing the impact they have as future policymakers.”
Originally from Seoul, South Korea, Kyuin Lee worked in voter education at the European Parliament during Brexit before moving to the International Labour Organization (ILO), focusing on development aid and diversity, equity and inclusion. 
With this scholarship, Kyuin said she plans to expand her scope of influence to international development at the McCourt School.
“I would like to make a measurable difference in the work that I do and in order to make a measurable difference you have to know how to measure the effects, the impacts, of your work,” Kyuin told The Hoya. “I was always about putting my figure on the thorniest problems of the day, while finding solutions guided by artifacts and evidence.”
Hidayatullah, who studied predictive analytics as an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, began her career as a consultant at Applied Predictive Technologies, a startup with a focus on predictive analytics. 
The startup was later bought by Mastercard, where Hidayatullah worked extensively with consumer data to develop software that tracks inclusive, effective growth in impoverished neighborhoods around the United States and the United Kingdom. 
Hidayatullah said the scholarship confirmed the importance of her work, which combined her expertise in data science with her passion for social impact.
“It was super exciting and humbling to get the scholarship but also to give myself this verification of ‘what you’re doing is interesting and they think it’s valuable and they want you to actually come and study this and enhance what you’re doing already,’” Hidayatullah told The Hoya.
Growing up in Sacramento, the capital of California, with a mother who worked as a journalist covering criminal justice policy, local politics have always been a point of interest for Bailey. 
After graduating from college, she spent three years in Greece as a college counselor, helping students apply to and matriculate at U.S. universities. She now works at the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank based in D.C. 
Bailey said she looks forward to expanding on the work of those who came before her. 
“I was shocked and sort of overcome with how lucky I am, frankly,” Bailey told The Hoya. “I’ve been so unbelievably impressed with the caliber of classmates, professors, staff, everyone at the McCourt School, so I really feel just incredibly honored to be counted as a peer among these people.”
Coming from Jordan, Mayaah’s work has focused on immigrant and refugee support. Most recently, he worked at the nonprofit Havenly, which provides refugee women with support on starting their careers in the U.S., including paid job training and English language classes. 
Maayah said he is honored to have the opportunity to pursue a graduate degree without worrying about costs.
“I was able to speak with some of the faculty before I was picked for that decision and I got along with them super well and they seemed very interested in my work,” Maayah said. “To have that be recognized, I just felt immense honor.”
This article was updated on 11/2 to correct the false claim that Sumin Lee could not be reached for comment.

The Walsh School of Foreign Service’s Asian Studies department hosted an interdisciplinary panel to discuss the ongoing political and economic crisis in Sri Lanka.
The Oct. 5 panel, entitled “The Crisis in Sri Lanka: Perspectives from Economics, Politics and Anthropology,” was formed in response to the current political and economic situation in the island nation of Sri Lanka. The panel aimed to address questions regarding Sri Lanka’s transition to a nation in turmoil. Panelists also discussed proactive responses to the crisis, outlining specific opportunities to assist Sri Lanka.
The event panel consisted of Shanta Devarajan, a Georgetown University professor in international development, Neil DeVotta, a professor of politics and international affairs at Wake Forest University, and Santa Clara University anthropology professor Mythri Jegathesan. The discussion was moderated by Cecilia Van Hollen, a professor of the Asian Studies department. 
The event comes on the heels of the Sri Lankan president’s resignation in July 2022 when he fled the country in response to months of protests against the government’s mismanagement of the economy. Though the Sri Lankan parliament has since appointed a new president, economic unrest continues as 86% of families are currently either skipping meals, eating less or buying worse food, according to the World Food Programme. 
As of Oct. 4, Amnesty International reports the nation’s bankruptcy and high rates of inflation are contributing to severe shortages in food, fuel and access to healthcare services. 
Given Sri Lanka’s relative stability in the past, the country’s drastic economic downturn was a surprise to many, according to Devarajan.
“Sri Lanka represents a bit of a puzzle, because on the one hand, it’s a remarkably successful economy with relatively rapid growth, enviable human development indicators and then an uninterrupted democracy,” Devarajan told The Hoya. “And on the other hand, it’s going through the worst economic crisis in its history, with GDP falling by over 8%. Inflation is at 70%. And a people’s movement threw out the democratically elected president.”
According to Devarajan, economists that closely followed Sri Lanka’s gradual debt accumulation have warned of an impending crisis for over a year, though the government consistently ignored warnings. 
“I would say since the summer of 2021, I’ve been giving talks and appearing on various seminars and webinars because we saw this debt crisis coming, and we were trying to get the government to actually embark on a debt restructuring IMF program,” Devarajan said. “But the government wasn’t listening, to be honest.”
Jegathesan said Sri Lanka’s national debt crisis has had a significant impact on the lives of Sri Lankans, especially the nation’s marginalized groups.
“The anthropological perspective provides a necessary centering on what people in Sri Lanka are experiencing on a day to day basis,” Jegathesan wrote to The Hoya. “The perspective accounts for how macro-level policies and infrastructures of fiscal and industrial governance directly impact individuals, households and communities, particularly those who are most marginalized in this crisis.”
Acknowledging the country’s historical ethnic issues and recent violent marginalization of certain minority communities is essential to understanding the political environment in Sri Lanka, according to DeVotta. 
“I think the thing that has been consistently relevant is the ethnonationalism associated with the post-independence development of the state and its link to democratic regression,” DeVotta said. “I think a lot of the problems that we see in the country are directly connected to this ethnocentric trajectory the state has pursued and the democratic regression that is associated with the trajectory.” 
According to Devarajan, it is important to understand historic ethnic and religious tensions when evaluating the current economic state of Sri Lanka. 
“Sri Lanka has two large language groups, as well as three major religions, and there’s no secret that certainly the relations between the Tamils and the Sinhalese has been problematic, and recently there’s been quite a lot of violence against Muslims,” Devarajan said. “So underlying this economic problem that I just described, I think there is an ethnic tension as well.”
DeVotta said it is important to examine the conflict from a variety of angles and not see the debt crisis as merely an economic issue. 
“Being able to deal with the ongoing crisis, via different perspectives, I think is interesting. The topic itself is timely,” Devotta said.

The staff of on-campus grocery store Vital Vittles raised $800 for cancer research through their participation in the Washington, D.C. 5K for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
Eight employees at Vittles, the flagship storefront of student-run business The Corp, participated in the Oct. 1 walk and run event, where 1,388 people from around the District collectively raised $180,836.61 for St. Jude’s. The hospital is dedicated to pediatric cancer and life-threatening disease research and to providing treatment for children around the world, free of charge — efforts that are funded by events like the 5K.
Vittles Operations Director Grace McSherry (COL ’24) said The Corp was drawn to St. Jude’s mission.
“It is a cause that has made such a difference in its years of operation, contributing to the increase in the childhood cancer survival rate from 20%-80%,” McSherry wrote to The Hoya. “After we researched more about everything that St. Jude does, we were even more eager to support this great organization.”
McSherry said cancer survivors and family members of cancer patients were present and shared their stories at the event.
“It was a really beautiful event that made the fundraising process that much more rewarding,” McSherry wrote. 
Joshua LaRock (MSB ’23), the director of Vittles, said the team’s participation in the fundraiser was part of The Corp’s efforts to expand their community impact beyond the Hilltop. 
“When our social committee proposed the opportunity to run the 5K for St. Jude, we did not hesitate to organize a team,” LaRock wrote to The Hoya. “The store bonded over a shared cause to treat and defeat childhood cancer with support from family, friends, alumni, and the Georgetown community.”
Vittles customer Olivia Kruszewski (NHS ’26) said she was happy to hear employees at the store were raising money for the hospital.
“I love to see the students of Vittles finding a way to give back, engage with the local community, and exemplify our Jesuit values by working for the greater good,” Kruszewski wrote to The Hoya. 
LaRock said employees used connections with friends, family and The Corp’s alumni network to raise funds. 
“We utilized our alumni communication channels to spread awareness; their support and thoughtful messages really made a heartfelt impact within our store’s community,” LaRock wrote. 
The Corp also solicited donations from current Georgetown students, putting posters up in and around the storefront with links to the donation portal, according to McSherry. 
The Vital Vittles team fell $200 short of their $1,000 fundraising goal, but LaRock said their fundraising efforts are still ongoing and community members may continue to donate through the portal through Dec. 31. 
McSherry said following the success of the 5K, Vital Vittles employees hope to participate in similar events in the future.
“This experience was beyond fulfilling,” McSherry wrote. “We are so thankful to everyone who has donated and taken time out of their day to raise awareness about our goal. We are looking forward to future fundraisers with them as well as collaboration with other impactful organizations!”
The Corp was founded 50 years ago as a way for students to raise money to help community members in need, and LaRock said this principle still guides the organization.
“The Corp was founded in the spirit of philanthropy, and that remains as the driving mission of The Corp today,” LaRock wrote. “Thousands of dollars in scholarships and dozens of partnerships have occurred in the past 50 years, and we look forward to deepening this impact on and off campus in the next 50 as well!”

The 2022 midterm elections serve as an important signal for the state of American politics in the midst of increased polarization and threats to democracy, two professors said at an event on the highly anticipated midterms.
The Oct. 3 event was the second of three discussions hosted by the Mortara Center for International Studies in an event series titled “In the News” and featured Vanderbilt University professor of political science John Sides, and Georgetown University government professor Michele Swers. The event was moderated by Mortara Center Director Elizabeth Saunders. At the event, the professors discussed the trends that may predict the outcome of the 2022 midterm elections that will determine control of the House of Representatives, Senate and governorships across the country. 
Sides discussed four patterns that will affect this year’s midterms: tectonic shifts, identity shocks, political calcification and political parity. Sides defined tectonic shifts as the trends of polarization contributing to the growing long-term disparity between the Republican and Democratic parties as each party moves towards the extremes, which is a trend particularly visible in the current Congress.
According to Sides, together with identity shocks, or short-term disparities between the two parties on identity-based issues such as race and gender, this tectonic shift has contributed to growing political polarization and increased voter loyalty to one party over another.
“We’ve been living in an era of historically small shifts, but 2020 really was a smaller shift,” Sides said at the event. “I would invite you to go back and to reread news coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, murder of George Floyd and racial justice protests, which framed them as potentially realigning events for American politics, where we would see big changes, big wholesale changes in the way that American politics works.” 
Only six Senators and 16 House members currently represent states and districts that voted for the opposite political party during the 2020 presidential election. Swers said rigid political partisanship has resulted in a nationalization of politics, or rather that national trends affect results more than local issues or candidates’ characters. 
According to Swers, this nationalization has led to a decline in split-ticketing, or voters selecting opposite parties for different elected positions, which may see voters more hesitant to vote against the party they supported in the 2020 presidential election.
“It’s really hard for me, if I have a D or an R next to my name, to outrun the party based on you knowing me as an individual these days,” Swers said at the event. “We’re seeing more and more often that your House race decision, your Senate decision, is very tied to the presidential vote.” 
While statistical analyses have proven that the president’s party lose seats in the House during typical miderm election years, this year’s election may be an exception due to renewed focus on abortion rights in the wake of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization Supreme Court decision which overturned Roe v. Wade, according to Swers. 
“Generally, you’re more motivated to vote when you’re angry than when you’re happy,” Swers said. “And the Dobbs decision made a change for Democrats so that you saw more Democrats now saying that they’re enthusiastic about voting, and particularly Democratic women.”
Swers also noted that 2022 is the year in which new districts from the 2020 census go into effect, meaning that many members of the House have retired to avoid losing their seat or been defeated in primaries as district boundaries and demographics shift. Many potential members are more extreme than the candidates they could replace, which could make it difficult for Republicans to govern should they win a House majority. With a small majority, more extreme members could block vital bills from passing. 
Sides said politically extreme candidates, together with the consequences of increased political polarization, is cause for concern as increasing antidemocratic behavior from Republican legislators could potentially exacerbate polarization and delegitimize America’s democratic process.
“Some people who are in American comparative politics who have written about polarization and its implications for democracy have noted that one of the risks is that voters will countenance things that are borderline treason, blatantly anti-democratic,” Sides said.

Reiss Science Building will undergo an asbestos abatement process set to end in November following the discovery of asbestos on the fourth floor of the building.
Materials containing asbestos were detected by Georgetown University maintenance staff, along with the Capital Projects team, a department within Planning and Facilities Management that focuses on the planning, designing and construction of Georgetown’s built environment, during preparations for an upcoming renovation project in the building. 
Upon discovering the asbestos, the university subcontracted a licensed asbestos abatement firm to remove the material. The work area will span approximately 4,300 square feet and will be covered to avoid spreading asbestos fibers throughout the rest of the building. As required by Washington, D.C. municipal regulations, the university placed posters in the building on Sept. 30, at least 30 days prior to the scheduling of the asbestos removal.
Asbestos, a naturally occurring mineral, was commonly used in construction during the 20th century in insulation, floor tiles and vehicle brakes due to its resistance to heat and corrosion. Today, asbestos usage is highly regulated by health codes across the country.
Many people are exposed to asbestos through construction or demolition work that disturbs fibers, causing the material to become airborne. Accumulation of asbestos in the body over a long period of time can cause serious health issues, including lung tissue scarring, lung cancer and mesothelioma. 
Angela van Doorn, a professor whose office is located on the fourth floor of the building, said that the flyers placed in the building were the only way that faculty members were notified of the presence of asbestos or the removal process.
“I only learned about the asbestos removal from the notifications posted throughout Reiss. As such I am unaware of the scope or the methods of the removal,” van Doorn wrote to The Hoya. “Just to be safe, I am not working from my office at this time.”
While van Doorn is choosing to work remotely, former University Registrar John Pierce (CAS ’72), whose office is also located on the fourth floor of Reiss, said he does not plan to change his working patterns.
“I haven’t made any changes to accommodate the work,” Pierce wrote to The Hoya. “I have no concerns. It seems to me that the project has been planned and handled well.”
The safety precautions taken during the asbestos removal will follow guidelines set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the District, according to an email to community members from the Office of Planning and Facilities Management.
The university will take careful steps to ensure the asbestos removal process is up to code and that community members are minimally exposed to asbestos, according to a university spokesperson.
“Per asbestos-abatement regulations and best practices, the entire work-space on the 4th floor will be tented during the asbestos-abatement work,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “Air quality is regularly monitored both inside the tented-work space and in adjacent building spaces to ensure a safe environment, with reports provided to the DC Department of Energy and Environment.” 
These precautions will ensure that normal workflow in Reiss will not be affected, the spokesperson said.
“The removal of asbestos-containing materials (ACM) will take place within a secure and contained area, and will not impact the operations or health of staff, students or faculty in the Reiss building,” the spokesperson wrote.
Georgetown’s asbestos policy requires all areas under renovation to be reviewed for any toxic materials, such as asbestos, mercury or lead.
Edward Barrows, director of the Center for the Environment, said the current asbestos abatement process is not the first time this has occurred in Reiss. 
“I really didn’t pay much attention to asbestos removal in Reiss in the last 4 years,” Barrows wrote to The Hoya. “I heard that the removal involved floor tiles, and that it was a low-risk removal. If the asbestos is ‘stabilized’ and not in the air, I am not worried about it.” 
Richard Squier, an associate professor in the computer science department, said asbestos treatment has been common throughout his two decades working in Reiss. 
“This started many years ago and has been ongoing from time to time,” Squier wrote. “I am glad to hear they are rehabbing some of the space in this building. There is a lot of unused space, and the more the space gets used, the more the maintenance will be paid attention to.”

In honor of National Hispanic Heritage Month, the Georgetown University School of Medicine’s Latino Medical Student Association (LMSA) is holding a series of events to celebrate Hispanic traditions and raise awareness about racial disparities in healthcare.
Led by co-Presidents Jacqueline Pujol (MED ’25) and Alexia Mendivil (MED ’25), LMSA’s month of programming includes information sessions on the effect of diabetes on Latinx health, a heritage festival at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, a health fair, a panel on Hispanic folk remedies and a Latin dance night.
Mendivil said she hopes events like these will help make Latinx medical students feel welcomed. 
“Our mission statement is to encourage Latina, Latino and Latinx students to pursue medicine, to advocate for increased representation of Latino physicians and to improve the health of the Hispanic community in the DMV area,” Mendivil said in an interview with The Hoya.
A central focus across LMSA’s efforts is developing cultural competence among the next generation of physicians currently studying at Georgetown, according to Pujol. This month, LMSA began its Hispanic heritage programming with a session on the gaps in health care professionals’ understanding of diabetes, specifically for Latinx patients. 
Diabetes disproportionately affects Hispanic or Latinx individuals — the percentage of Hispanic adults with diabetes is 80% higher than that of non-Hispanic whites, due in part to sociocultural factors like access to healthcare, income inequality and language barriers.
A key message of the event was the importance of integrative treatment, which consists of partnerships among primary physicians, endocrinologists and dieticians to provide holistic care, according to Pujol.
When planning LMSA’s panels, Pujol said it was important to find speakers who were representative of the populations being served.
“Our first priority was finding physicians who were of Hispanic origin, of Latinx origin, who spoke Spanish. And the endocrinologist that we recruited from Arizona, he is known for promoting Latino health, especially with diabetes,” Pujol told The Hoya. “The other physicians that we recruited were from MedStar, and they also were Latinx origin. So that was basically our priority.”
Pujol said Latinos are underrepresented in the field of medicine, as Latinos make up almost 19% of the total U.S. population but account for only 7% of physicians and surgeons in the United States.
Daniela Hernandez (MED ’26), a first-year medical student, said she decided to enroll at Georgetown in part because of LMSA’s outreach.
“One of the reasons why I chose Georgetown was because of the LMSA Cafecito Hours and the community I found there,” Hernandez said. “It was those things that I did not find anywhere else that compelled me to attend Georgetown.”
As part of their dedication to greater inclusion, LMSA members have personally reached out to over a hundred potential incoming Hispanic students like Hernandez to offer to answer questions about the school, according to Mendivil.
“One of our biggest efforts has been calling and emailing, meeting up with prospective students who got accepted to Georgetown and are interviewing at Georgetown,” Mendivil said. “We’re really determined with our goals to keep increasing the representation of the Latinx students at our school.”
According to Casey Sheahan, associate director of admissions at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, LMSA helps welcome Latinx accepted students to the medical school and support them during their time at Georgetown. 
“Many of the members are Student Ambassadors, which is a role where they interact with applicants throughout the application process,” Sheahan wrote to The Hoya. “Some of the students that made calls last year are now friends/very close with the applicants that they called that are now in the M1 class!”
Isela Melendez-Carpio, director of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) at the Georgetown University School of Medicine said the DEI office is excited to collaborate with LMSA throughout Hispanic Heritage Month.
“The momentum has grown over the past few years, a huge testament to our Latinx students for paving the way for future generations,” Melendez-Carpio wrote to The Hoya. “This year’s programming reflects their excellence and urgency for bringing some of the most complex issues impacting the Latinx community.”
Through its Hispanic Heritage Month programming, Pujol said LSMA strives to encourage greater diversity in the future of the medical field by working to recognize and appreciate marginalized identities like Latinx physicians. 
“As LMSA and as future Latine doctors, we feel it is important to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month to honor the richness of our cultures and to bring attention to help address the crucial needs in our community, including Latine representation in medicine,” Pujol wrote.

The Wharf will open new restaurants, office spaces, parks and luxury apartments as its second phase of development nears completion.
The Wharf, a popular outdoor development in southwest Washington, D.C., is home to a number of restaurants, hotels, shops and apartment complexes. While The Wharf opened in 2017, its development was split into two phases. Phase 2 will complete the remaining 1.25 million square feet of the development with the addition of new restaurants, office spaces, parks and luxury apartments, and expects these renovations to be complete by the end of the year. A public celebration of the opening is planned to take place on the five-year anniversary of The Wharf’s opening Oct. 12, although some Phase 2 locations will not open until renovations are completed.
The $3.6 billion expansion includes seven new restaurants that are set to open, including Gordon Ramsay Hell’s Kitchen, Kinfolk Southern Kitchen, Milk & Honey and Slice of Matchbox.
The Pendry Hotel, a luxury boutique hotel, will begin accepting guests Nov. 1. Along with the hotel, 255 apartments and 96 condominiums will also be added, bringing a fresh real estate market to The Wharf. Luxury apartment complex The Tides is open and has allowed residents to begin leasing.
Julie Keleti, who serves as the marketing and communications manager for the District Wharf Community Association, said she is excited about the new recreational and cultural engagement opportunities that the expansion will bring.
“This is the completion of The Wharf that was always envisioned from the beginning,” Keleti wrote to The Hoya. 
Georgetown University McDonough School of Business (MSB) associate professor Christie Nordhielm said the expansion and opening of new locations in Phase 2 will likely expand the commercial success of The Wharf.
“There is massive expansion down here right now, a commercial expansion,” Nordhielm said to The Hoya. “The expansion thus far has been successful, so the only reason that any decent-thinking business person will make an investment like that is because they believe that there is a potential profit in it.”
According to Keleti, The Wharf has seen a surge in business in the past few months as District officials have eliminated COVID-19-related restrictions.
“The Wharf has been a place for years where local businesses have flourished,” Keleti wrote. “During the past 6 months, at least a quarter of The Wharf’s retail tenants have repeatedly reported some of the strongest monthly sales ever, and The Anthem has sold over 19% more tickets between January and August of 2022 than they did during the same pre-pandemic period in 2019.”
The Wharf estimates that 12 to 15 million people visit its location each year. Keleti said she hopes the new waterfront additions will further connect The Wharf to its local community.
“The Wharf as a whole has really connected DC back to its waterfront, and this Fall that is further highlighted by offering a full mile of waterfront experiences from the Fish Market to Fort McNair,” Keleti wrote.
Nordhielm said she hopes the expansion will positively impact economic opportunities in the neighborhood around The Wharf.
“For D.C., the trick economically is to bring in people from outside of D.C.,” Nordhielm said. “We have a fixed amount of people here in this area, so anything that attracts people from the DMV, the greater DMV, and of course nationally or even internationally, is what’s really going to benefit D.C.”
Keleti said she believes Phase 2 will serve as a positive contribution to the vibrant culture that is already prominent in the District.
“DC is such a fun and dynamic city with something for everyone, and The Wharf is adding to that energy in really exciting new ways,” Keleti wrote. “We hope that another half-mile will continue to offer new reasons for Washingtonians to keep coming back to The Wharf and enjoying what has made it a beloved neighborhood and destination in the District since it opened in 2017.”

Georgetown University is joining an international initiative that will allow community members to upload photos of plants, animals and insects around campus to an app that will inform research about biodiversity on the Hilltop.
The Georgetown Bee Campus team, which consists of a group of five professors and several student assistants, is leading the university’s engagement with the initiative, entitled iNaturalist. The network is an initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society that tracks biodiversity and crowdsources information to help scientists understand when and where certain organisms are present.
In July 2020, Georgetown was designated a Bee Campus by the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, an international organization focused on the conservation of organisms crucial to biodiversity. This certification requires the university to make seven commitments that support the presence of bees and other pollinating insects on campus, of which the iNaturalist project is one. 
Any Georgetown community member can take photos of flora and fauna on campus and upload them to the iNaturalist app, where artificial intelligence helps the user identify the species of the organism in the image. Data is then added to the iNaturalist network, helping researchers better understand what organisms are living in the area.
The Common Lantana, a red and yellow flower that blooms near the Healey Family Student Center, the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail butterfly and the Florida Predatory Stink Bug are among the 115 species dozens of community members have already identified as of Oct. 6.
Edward Barrows, a Bee Campus team member and biology professor who brought the idea of joining iNaturalist to the team, said the data has already enriched his understanding of the species that exist on the Hilltop.
“We need a comprehensive list of GU organisms to help sustain them,” Barrows wrote to The Hoya. “iNaturalist could eventually database 1000s of GU’s organisms. I’ve been looking at GU organisms since 1975, and iNaturalist is showing me GU species on campus I have not previously seen at GU.”
Bill Hahn, chair of the Bee Campus project and adjunct professor in the School of Foreign Service, said the project will allow the Bee Campus team to improve and evaluate the effectiveness of their conservation plans.
“I hope that the project will better document native and non-native pollinators on campus,” Hahn wrote to The Hoya. “The results of the project will help establish a baseline for future studies on campus biodiversity.”
Barrows said Georgetown’s participation in the iNaturalist initiative advances the Bee Campus team’s goal to preserve biodiversity on campus, an important measure that is often overlooked.
“Many people I know have biodiversity blindness, including plant blindness and pollinator blindness,” Barrows wrote to The Hoya. “Earth’s biodiversity is crucial to humans’ health and survivorship as a species on Earth.”
Cynthia Wei, a member of the Bee Campus team and associate teaching professor in the School of Foreign Service, said she wants iNaturalist to inspire students to be more conscious of the hundreds of diverse species on campus. 
“I hope people will be more aware of the pollinators around them and of nature around them more generally — I think it’s really easy to just not notice,” Wei said in an interview with The Hoya.
In addition to joining iNaturalist, the Bee Campus team is working on other projects to make the Hilltop more pollinator friendly for bees. The team is working to plant native plants, create nesting sites for insects and emphasize the importance of education about pollinators, according to Hahn. 
Their strategy also includes teaching material on pollinator conservation, expanding student engagement in research related to pollination and posting flyers to inform about pollinators. The team’s work is funded by the Georgetown Earth Commons and a 2020 grant from the Laudato Si’ fund, which sponsors projects that improve sustainability on campus.
Wei said iNaturalist allows anybody to join a community of citizen scientists and engage with the preservation of biodiversity. 
 “When you learn more about something, you care more about it,” Wei said. “Once you know that it’s not just a bug, but actually a particular species with a name and history, behavior and how it’s different from others, it just becomes a lot more interesting and valuable.”

The fourth full-service grocery store to open east of the Anacostia River, the first in over a decade, recently welcomed its first customers last week. The stores will expand food access in Wards 7 and 8.
The store, a franchise of the German retail grocery chain Lidl, is located in Skyland Town Center in Ward 7. Wards 7 and 8 have traditionally been considered food deserts, or urban regions where a significant proportion of the population lives more than a mile away from the nearest grocery store. The new Lidl location will help provide groceries for almost 160,000 residents that reside east of the Anacostia River. Its completion is a result of 15 years of work by residents, community leaders and Washington, D.C. officials, putting the count of full-service grocery stores in the District’s seventh and eighth wards at four.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said the opening of the new Lidl location serves as the culmination of hard work from residents whose efforts ensured increased food access in the area.
“For years, the community in Ward 7 has made clear what they want to see at Skyland Town Center – retail, housing and dining. I promised we would deliver, and we are keeping that promise,” Bowser said in a press release. “Today, I am grateful for the residents and community leaders who never gave up on Skyland, and I’m grateful to Lidl for helping us accomplish something that hasn’t been done in 15 years: opening a full-service supermarket East of the River.”
Bowser has put forth significant resources towards creating affordable food access for the community, including allocating $73 million to the Food Access Fund, which awards grants to food-related businesses seeking to open a new location in areas of the District that are designated as having low food access. 
Bowser has also made alterations to the Supermarket Tax Incentive, which waves taxes and fees to grocery stores to encourage development and investment in areas lacking access to groceries and fresh food, and increased funding for the Neighborhood Prosperity Fund, which provides financing for projects that attract private investment to distressed communities.
Uwe Brandes, faculty director of the Georgetown Urban and Regional Planning Program said while more must be done, the addition of the new grocery store will provide more options to consumers east of the Anacostia.
“There are two other large grocery stores east of the Anacostia river, so this one store does not represent a sea-change,” Brandes wrote. “However, it is heartening to see more diversity in retail offerings and since Lidl specializes in discount groceries, this will be a valuable and competitive alternative to the other two.” 
Brandes said the new store is also a part of a surge of new construction in the area which will offer additional options for the Anacostia community.
“The market demand is clearly there. There is no reason why other retailers should not immediately follow,” Brandes wrote to The Hoya. “This store opening represents a growing recognition that pent-up consumer demand is already there and new opportunities for other grocery stores and restaurants will be embraced by the community.”
D.C. Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development John Falcicchio (D), said the store’s opening signals the end of long-distance commutes in search of healthy food options for many residents and their families. 
“Mayor Bowser remains committed to expanding food access points East of the River,” Falcicchio said in a press release from the Mayor’s Office. “We will not stop this work until we eradicate food deserts in Wards 7 and 8.”
According to Ward 7 Councilmember Vincent Gray, Lidl’s decision to open a location in Ward 7 represents an investment in D.C. residents who live east of the Anacostia River. 
“Lidl at the Skyland Town Center in Ward 7, which is also the first Lidl in the District, will provide residents with greater food access, healthier food options and serve as a vital retail anchor,” Gray said in the press release. “I am excited about the valuable location the East End provides for retail and hospitality opportunities.”
Brandes said it is important to continue to work towards ensuring all regions of the District are able to thrive.
“With about a quarter of the city’s population living east of the Anacostia river, there is no reason why neighborhood centers cannot thrive to the same degree they are in other neighborhoods of the city,” Brandes wrote.
