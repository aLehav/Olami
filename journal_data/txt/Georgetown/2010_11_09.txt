Last weekend, hundreds of college students descended on the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Bethesda, Md., for a weekend of diplomacy, crisis situations and backroom deals. Each year, the Georgetown International Relations Association holds two major Model U.N. conferences: the National Collegiate Security Conference at the beginning of November and the North American Invitational Model United Nations in February. NCSC’s executive team, Secretary-General Alex Bozzette (SFS ’12) and Executive Director Leah Dreyfuss (SFS ’12), sat down with THE HOYA to take a look back at this year’s conference, charity programs and the differences between NCSC and NAIMUN.
When did planning for NCSC begin?
Leah: Actually, just about a year before NCSC took place. I believe we were first appointed on Oct. 27, 2009, and NCSC started on Oct. 28, 2010, so a full year of planning went into four days.
How did the move of the location affect the conference?
Alex: NCSC was held on campus at the Georgetown Conference Center in previous years, but the move to the Hyatt Regency was a very positive one. It provided a much better conference atmosphere and simultaneously allowed us to create a much more cohesive staff. NCSC was a bonding experience that was far better than anything we could have imagined.
L: The hotel we were at this year is actually going to be our home for the next two years. We basically took over the hotel, and the staff at the hotel was absolutely wonderful. They were a really useful and energetic staff. They actually enjoyed having 700 college students for four days, as much as one might think to the contrary.
Both of you have experience with NAIMUN. What would you say are the differences between NAIMUN and NCSC?
A: NAIMUN has high school students and NCSC has college students. That is an importance difference that is reflected in some committees that we run. At NCSC, by having college-age delegates, you gain something.
L: There’s a certain level of substantive understanding and detailed knowledge that you have with college students that you don’t have with high school students, which allows you to conduct simulations that I think high school students would be overwhelmed by. NAIMUN is in essence a Model U.N. conference, in that it simulates a lot of actual U.N. bodies. NCSC differs in that you tend to simulate very few U.N. bodies and focus more on what we believe are more powerful decision-making bodies in international politics.
A: By having participants and staffers that are the same age, something that NCSC gains is more of a dialogue and an educational experience. When committee session ends, you’re not as separate as you are in a traditional college staff, high school participant Model U.N.-type conference. It builds relationships across universities that go beyond the four days of the actual conference.
What would you say is the main difference between running the conference and competing in the conference?
A: One of the things that helped to make NCSC as strong as it was, was that each of our staffers brought something unique to each simulation they participated in. You had people’s personal backgrounds and academic interests coming together on the staffing side to create simulations that were each unique in their own special way that heightened the quality of each of the committees we ran and created a more positive experience for all of our delegates.
L: There’s a certain degree of staffing that affords you a certain sense of omnipotence that being a delegate doesn’t. I know that the chairs and crisis managers of NCSC and of NAIMUN very much enjoy the fact that they get to control the way things are going. But the delegates this year at NCSC really pushed our chairs and our crisis managers and made the events turn in ways that were not anticipated, which I would say is a sign of the quality of delegates we get at NCSC. They really push our staff, and seem to say, `Do you really know what you’re talking about? Are you as substantively strong in this area as you’ve purported to be with a 30-some-odd page background guide?’
What were some of the more unique committees at NCSC this year?
A: We try to think of committees that broadly relate to that security focus, which I really enjoyed, because we ran committees that addressed all different sides of security. You had humanitarian security, geopolitical security and martial security in the more traditional sense that you’d imagine, so we ran everything from a health crisis to a tsunami crisis to a historical crisis of war simulation between multiple bodies.
L: So the health crisis Alex was talking about simulated the U.S. National Security Council. Our former secretary-general, Mike McGrath (NHS ’11), actually led that committee, and he is a student in the NHS majoring in management and health care policy, so he wanted to do a hypothetical epidemic outbreak, and how the U.S. National Security Council would respond to such an event. As far as the tsunami one, we had ASEAN, which is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and a summit in response to the 2004 tsunami, which actually was a larger committee but ran really, really well, the delegates said, as far as the crisis went, which we were really pleased to hear, and the last one he referred to was the Soviet jihad triple crisis, which was a simulation of three different acting bodies – the Soviet Politburo, the Pakistani cabinet and the Afghani mujahideen in the 1980s simulating the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. As you can see, I think the topical breadth as well as the geographical breadth was immense, and we were really pleased to see that.
A: We got a little bit into this, but something else that varies across committees hugely is committee size. We ran everything from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which had a hundred participants, to a simulation of the Hamas leadership summit in Gaza City, which had 16 delegates, so you had a very different dynamic across NCSC’s different committees.
Did you face any challenges during NCSC?
A: Any time you have 700 college students gathering in a hotel, you’re going to have challenges, but overall things were managed well and people had fun without having too much fun.
L: As far as college students go, we saw some things we weren’t expecting, but nothing that we couldn’t handle. We all walked away relatively unscathed.
What kinds of activities did NCSC try to encourage outside of the committee sessions?
A: Outside of committee, we try to create a social atmosphere that can’t exist at NAIMUN, because of the age difference.
L: We have a bar club for our 21-and-olders. We also do trick-or-treating on Embassy Row. Finally, we also had the traditional club night, where we rented out an entire club for all the students to mingle.
A: A new tradition was NCSC charity drive. It was a fundraising competition between all the committees at NCSC. Each committee got to choose [its] own charity to donate to. In doing so, we were able to match the interests of the students with the charity they could donate to. In the end, we gave all the money raised to the committee that raised the most money.
L: We had to work during the summer to develop the perfect equation, so nobody would be punished because of the size of their committee. We ended up weighing per-capita donations the most, and the committee that ended up winning was the Hamas Leadership Committee, which donated the money to Seeds for Peace. We raised almost $4,000, and our sponsoring organization GIRA is donating one-fourth of the money we raised, bringing our total up to $5,000, more than five times what NCSC has ever raised.

Georgetown may be undermining its Catholic heritage as part of a broader liberalization trend at D.C. universities, says one report commissioned by Campus Reform, a conservative action network.
Among D.C. universities surveyed, The George Washington University was rated most conservative, while Howard University was deemed the most liberal. The Catholic University of America was not included in the study. The Campus Reform study evaluated the political climate of top universities across the country on three criteria – campus life, faculty and university policy.
While D.C. colleges display liberal tendencies, this is not just a regional issue, according to Abigail Alger, an analyst at Campus Reform.
“[D.C.] may be liberal, but we have seen trends consistent with this growing liberalism from Texas to Michigan.” Alger said. “It’s a national trend.”
Georgetown was rated as largely liberal, but less so than other universities.
“America’s colleges and universities are dominated by liberals, and Georgetown University is no different. Too often, the campus left uses its power to indoctrinate the next generation,” said Morton Blackwell, president of the Leadership Institute and founder of CampusReform.org.
Campus Reform’s survey said that Georgetown was “far too gay,” citing the existence of the LGBTQ Resource Center, which was established in August 2008, as well as several courses that supposedly undermine Georgetown’s traditional values, including “Gender, Sexuality and the Body” and the supposedly socialist “Ethics & Economics.”
According to Bryan Woll (COL ’12), president of the Georgetown University College Democrats, the openness to different backgrounds and traditions is what makes Georgetown unique.
“I happen to believe, and I think many others on campus would agree, that these are [the] very things that make Georgetown a great place to go to school. The fact that we embrace people of different faith, ethnicity, gender, orientation and experiences is something that ought to be commended rather than vilified,” Woll said.
Some Georgetown students said they took issue with what they see as a left-leaning faculty. During the midterm elections, faculty and staff donated significantly more to Democratic candidates than to Republican ones.
According to Cole Glass (MSB ’12) faculty’s perceived political tendencies come across in their teaching.
“[University faculty are] increasing liberalist ideals in society as a whole,” he said.
The Campus Reform review also stated that liberal campus groups outnumber conservative groups 3 to 1. Woll said the spirit behind the statistic is accurate.
“There are certainly more liberal- and progressive-minded student groups, and those student groups are by far more active than conservative ones,” Woll said in an email.
The survey also determined that the majority of students on campus support liberal causes, a belief challenged by Woll.
“I think that there are more students who identify as conservative than these statistics indicate – for whatever reason, these students ch oose not to be involved in student organizations,” he said.
Among other D.C. universities, Howard was most negatively reviewed by Campus Reform. According to the report, the university’s College Republicans received no university funding, as opposed to the $2,600 received by liberal organizations on campus. The report also specifically criticized American University for its housing program. The Campus Reform report criticized American for offering coed suites and apartments to its students. In contrast, GWU received a more positive review than other local universities for having active conservative groups on its campus.

For longtime CBS news anchor Dan Rather, the current administration has failed to make good on campaign promises. “[President] Obama over-promised and under-delivered,” he said at a Friday panel event in Lohrfink Auditorium.
Rather, who now manages a TV newsmagazine on HD Net, said Americans, faced with an economy in limbo, expect their leaders to “address it boldly and address it with some audacity.”
The event provided a forum for prominent political minds to discuss the results of last week’s midterm elections.
Other members of the panel included Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio), former Clinton Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, Sky News political editor Adam Boulton, Chicago Sun-Times Washington Bureau Chief Lynn Sweet, Arab-American Institute President James Zogby and Henry Olsen, vice president of the National Research Initiative. Washington insider and adjunct professor in Georgetown’s department of German and European studies Jon-Christopher Bua moderated the discussion, which attempted to separate reality from political spin to come away with an honest assessment of America’s political future.
In her introductory comments, SFS Dean Carol Lancaster reminded audience members that the American people are at a critical juncture in the history of American politics, at which the elected leaders must decide whether to capitalize on partisan tensions or come together to achieve progress on common objectives.
The panelists addressed the implications of Americans voting against the president’s party, a trend that has marked the last three midterm elections. In response to his peers who characterized the pattern as a reflection of the big government/small government debate that has defined partisan politics for decades, Ickes said that people are not concerned with the size of the government, but rather with what results it can produce for them.
The economic difficulties suffered by Americans have led to what Zogby calls “irrational” patterns in their voting behavior. “People are now in a position where they’re seeking change so desperately that they’re willing to vote against their own economic interests in order to achieve it,” he said.
Another hot topic of discussion revolved around the panel’s consensus on whether the Republican Party’s victory in these latest elections was short-lived. Panelists debated whether or not bipartisanship would be necessary in the next two years if conservatives hoped to maintain a majority in the House or recapture the presidency. Ickes said that the same dramatic shift in public opinion that resulted in such a massive turnover in this election could just as easily result in a Republican defeat in 2012.
“Republicans have a very short lifespan here,” said Ickes, who went on to explain that if the economy continues to worsen, voters will blame conservative leadership just as readily as they recently turned on their Democratic counterparts. Panel attendee and member of Georgetown University College Democrats Jake Sticka (COL ’13) reacted positively to Ickes’ assessment.
“As a Democrat, it was heartening to hear so many individuals with great political knowledge say that the recent Republican victory was a temporary one,” he said.
While panelists put a damper on conservatives’ post-election euphoria, they were also quick to address the failings of the Democratic Party that led to last week’s shift – the most significant partisan turnover since the 1930s. Despite his victory in Tuesday’s elections, Kucinich was the most vehement critic of his party’s actions over the past two years. “We blew it, plain and simple. We had a chance to summon a New Deal-type exuberance and we failed,” Kucinich said.
At one point, Kucinich became so animated in his frustration that Rather jokingly cautioned the Congressman to tone it down, reminding him, “We are at a Jesuit institution here, Dennis.”
Olsen also urged his colleagues not to take this conservative turn too lightly, reminding them that many of the seats lost belonged to members in areas with longstanding liberal voting records, most notably, 18-term Rep. James Oberstar (D-Minn.). A statistician by trade, Olsen encouraged liberals to cater to the white working class in 2012, as the majority of seats lost were those held by rural, southern “blue dog” Democrats.
Ultimately, the panelists reflected that while a conservative majority in the House may make it more difficult for the Obama administration to govern, the Democrats will have it easier politically. With the new split in congressional power, panel members said, any public dissatisfaction with politics on Capitol Hill will no longer reflect negatively on just Democrats.
The event was sponsored through the collaborative efforts of the BMW Center for German and European Studies and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service.

For those students not enrolled in the McDonough School of Business, late-night entry woes to the Hariri Building could soon be a thing of the past.
The Georgetown University Student Association Senate signed off on a proposal that calls for a change in policy so students from Georgetown’s other schools would have access to the Hariri building – a popular on-campus study spot – after 10 p.m. Currently, non-MSB students are barred entry after this time, unless an MSB student can help by swiping his or her approved GOCard to access the building.
Co-sponsored by the GUSA Academic Affairs Committee, the resolution states that the MSB is the only building on campus that is completely accessible to students of one school, but not the others.
During Sunday’s GUSA meeting in Healy Hall, Senator Nathaniel Tisa (SFS ’14) introduced the resolution to the greater senate body.
The bill specifically brings up the issue of security. If a Georgetown student from any school other than the MSB is in the vicinity of the Hariri building after 10 p.m. and needs to enter the building in accordance with a security procedure, he or she will not be able to do so.
“I am hoping the resolution can allow us to make headway against an inconvenient policy,” Tisa said, who also discussed the steps necessary to put the plan into action.
“Once we start meeting with the right administrators, such as the dean of the MSB, I’m pretty confident we will reach an understanding,” Tisa added.
GUSA senators were receptive to this bill, and voted it in unanimously.
“This bill is an important first step to opening an important academic resource to all students. Implementation [of the bill] is key, and I have great confidence in the Academic Affairs Committee to advance it,” GUSA Senate Speaker Adam Mortillaro (COL ’12) said.
The bill also cites the computer terminals and breakout rooms reserved for students in the business school. Though these can still be limited to use by the MSB students, the bill suggests the open lounges and lobbies not slated for MSB use exclusively be open to all students throughout the entire day.
The senate requested that the university “amend business school policy to allow for more equitable and uniform utilization of the building by all students while maintaining the availability of specialized rooms and terminals for the students that require them.”
Students are reacting favorably to the possibility.
“That would be so perfect,” said Aarohi Vora (COL ’14) who says she does most of her studying after 8 p.m. anyway. “After a certain hour I need to get away from my bedroom and the MSB is the perfect place to do it.”

Over 6,500 individuals in D.C. are considered homeless, according to the Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness. Last Saturday in Franklin Park, one of them – a man in a sweater and glasses – stepped up in line to receive a cup of soup. He had arrived in the District after living in the Midwest and Florida for a while, he explained to the student volunteers from Hoya Outreach Programs and Education. They asked how he liked D.C.
“Well, it’s a place to live,” he said, and smiled.
The man was one of many homeless men and women who received a ration of hot soup, two pieces of fruit, a bottle of water and silverware that afternoon from H.O.P.E’s Mobile Soup Kitchen. The “kitchen” – a Georgetown van with a vat of soup donated from O’Donovan Hall and cardboard crates of fruit in the back – gives out 50 to 70 cups of hot soup every other Saturday to needy people living in D.C.
H.O.P.E. is a student-run campus group that operates both the Friday evening Grab ‘n’ Give program and the Saturday afternoon Mobile Soup Kitchen. Other campus groups such as Women Advancing Gender Equity and Adelphi join the volunteers in giving out donated food in local parks. The soup kitchen is just one of the ways Georgetown students work to ease the lives of the District’s many homeless men, women and children.
The number of homeless people in D.C. has risen about 5 percent since last year and over 13 percent since 2007. It also includes over 1,500 homeless children. D.C.’s homeless population is over twice the size of that of New York City, which has 3,111 homeless according to The New York Times. The sheer number of people without homes in the nation’s capital is startling to some students.
“It’s just amazing to me that there can be so many homeless people in the capital,” Cat Wright (COL ’11), a volunteer for the Mobile Soup Kitchen, said.
Students were further startled by the fact that so many homeless live in the shadows of the nation’s most powerful, walking down the street side by side.
“It’s [an] alarming [sight, especially] when you’re in the backyard of the World Bank,” Nayha Arora (SFS ’11), one of the volunteers, said.
According to The Washington Post, the poor state of the economy has exacerbated problems as individuals and families from outside the city come into the District in search of a place to stay. In past winters the city was required to shelter any individual in below-freezing weather. Due to major budget deficits, this year the city has proposed first housing those with proof of prior D.C. residence in the last two years or proof of previous assistance from the District. According to the Post and the National Coalition for the Homeless, no other major city has ever enacted a similar policy.
But while the city government has taken a tough stance with budget cuts in store, local organizations are trying to fill the gap.
One of the most visible attempts has been tabloid-style paper Street Sense, which is sold at many Metro stations and downtown street corners. Started in 2003, about half the paper is written by current and former homeless individuals. Today it has over 100 vendors and nearly 16,000 copies in circulation every two weeks.
In addition to raising awareness, the paper works to combat homelessness and poverty, by allowing homeless vendors to profit from sales. According to Street Sense’s website, the paper’s vendors make about $45 per day selling the papers. Street Sense also helps them find housing, receive health care and enroll in job-training classes.
H.O.P.E.’s mission is fundamentally the same as the city’s: to ease the lives of the homeless and raise awareness at the same time.
Next week H.O.P.E. will organize its annual Hunger and Homelessness Week at Georgetown. Events will include Knit for the Needy, an Issue of the Month Dinner and Grab `n’ Give, where students donate leftover meals on their meal plans to feed homeless people in D.C.
For students involved in organizations like H.O.P.E., however, the experience has become educational, as well as philanthropic. Next Saturday they will visit Franklin Park again. With temperatures dropping and many more homeless still in need of sustenance, H.O.P.E’s volunteers said that they enjoyed making a difference.
“I think there’s so much to learn. . I think personally my perspective is pretty narrow and it’s important to widen [it],” Arora said. “We’re all confined by our own experiences.”

The Department of Public Safety has implemented a number of security measures to prevent more crimes in Village A, following reports of four burglaries and an attempted burglary in the apartment complex in October.
Among the moves are a rise in night patrols in Village A and on nearby Prospect Street and Library Walk, as well as increased, brighter lighting features in Village A public areas, monitors of overnight vehicular access to campus and personal safety consultations for Village A residents.
At a Village A community meeting Monday evening, DPS officials outlined the new measures and solicited feedback from students.
“We are trying a multi-faceted approach to meeting our immediate security needs. We have a strong security presence, and we’re trying to work with students to find a solution,” DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith said at the meeting.
While students at the meeting said that they appreciated the boost in security, they did express reservations.
“The presence of DPS has been huge and, frankly speaking, fairly creepy. It feels intrusive,” Alyssa Lichtenberger (COL ’12) said.
Smith responded by saying that DPS was not trying to violate students’ personal space but was trying to be a resource for students with security concerns.
Although participation was sparse, with only five students in attendance, Office of Residence Life Associate Director Ed Gilhool, who facilitated the meeting, said that he was pleased by the feedback. He said that at last week’s community meeting, about 20 students had been in attendance.
But students not present at Monday’s meeting noticed the shake-up in security.
“They’ve done a lot with the security measures,” resident Mike Manchester (MSB ’12) said. “You can’t walk around Village A without seeing at least one security guard. And that spotlight [in Lauinger parking lot] is freaking huge.”
While the safety consultations for Village A students are optional, the university strongly urged all apartments to sign up for the program. As part of the session, DPS and ResLife representatives will meet with students to direct them on personal safety, locking procedures and facilities queries for individual residences, according to university spokeswoman Julie Bataille.
Some students voiced concerns over the effectiveness of the measures.
“To me, it seems like they need more permanent changes to Village A security because even if they do scare this burglar off, there is no clear plan in place to actually prevent future burglars from having the same ability to break into our apartments as they did one month ago,” John Leader (MSB ’12) said.
Others said they witnessed a lack of security in the Village A area on a structural level.
“Maybe it’s a testament to the fact that Village A is the only open dorm on campus,” Manchester said. “Maybe the university needs to rethink whether it should be a swipe-access facility.”
Smith said that DPS was considering comprehensively changing Village A security by making the apartment complex gated, with controlled access, fences and stationed security officers like in many residence halls.
The increased safety measures are part of a long-term move toward better campus security, according to university officials.
“These areas are constantly evaluated, with security measures taken as needed, in order to provide saturation of the area,” Bataille said. “These efforts will change over time as needed.”
Rocco DelMonaco, vice president for university safety, said that the security push is merely the next step in a gradual process toward eradicating crime on campus.
“We are pushing up visibility and taking further steps,” DelMonaco said. “This is another tier up in creating a safer community.”
DelMonaco also said that DPS was implementing more intelligence-led policing – patrols targeted to ward areas where crime occurs frequently. But this is not the first time that DPS has ramped up its security measures as a reaction to persistent crime in the past year.
In March, a string of burglaries in university-owned student townhouses on 36th Street prompted a surge in safety efforts and a heightened police presence in the area, similar to the ongoing initiatives in the Village A area. In March, before the increased security, four burglaries or attempted burglaries occurred on 36th Street. After the Metropolitan Police Department and DPS actions in the area, one burglary was reported, in April.
No burglaries have been reported in Village A since the new measures were implemented. DelMonaco declined to comment on the progress of the investigation, which is being led by MPD.

Law professor Lisa Heinzerling will be returning to Georgetown after two years of serving as the associate administrator for the Office of Policy at the Environmental Protection Agency. In her time at EPA, Heinzerling helped shape the agency’s current climate policies and pursued the regulation of greenhouse gases.
Heinzerling’s departure comes amid several resignations in the Obama administration, including Obama’s senior adviser and National Security Adviser Gen. James Jones (SFS ’66). Heinzerling said that she always intended to step down at the end of her two-year leave of absence from the Law Center.
“It was something that had been in the works for a while,” she said. “I fully intended to return to Georgetown. I view Georgetown Law as my permanent home.”
Nevertheless, Heinzerling said that she greatly enjoyed her experience at the EPA.
“It was fabulous. It’s given me a broader understanding and a real appreciation for civil service,” she said.
Heinzerling, who has been with the Law Center since 1993, plans to teach a class on administrative law in the spring. Heinzerling previously taught environmental law and natural resource law.
“I have a new appreciation for how complicated the regulatory process is,” Heinzerling said. “[Working at the EPA] was really helpful because for me I have a background in basically all the laws we work with.”
After receiving degrees from Princeton and the University of Chicago Law School, Heinzerling served as a clerk for both the U.S. Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court. She then served as an assistant attorney general in Massachusetts with a specialty in environmental law; she gained fame during her career as assistant attorney general in the landmark case of Massachusetts v. EPA, which forced the agency to regulate greenhouse gases.

While the strength of the human-dolphin connection is evident for many familiar with the sea mammal – not to mention fans of the 1996 movie “Flipper” – a Georgetown professor’s studies show that the bond between dolphins may be even moreimportant.
Janet Mann, professor of psychology and biology, co-authored an original study that explores the social and genetic factors involved in reproduction for wild dolphins in Australia.
The results of the study have wide-reaching implications for the interplay between nurture and nature in the fields of biology and psychology.
“The main finding of our recent paper was that social [factors] and genetics interact when it comes to female fitness, but social factors appear to be more important. This may help explain why dolphins are so sociable in the first place,” Mann said.
For Mann, a focus on dolphins stemmed from research she was doing on humans in Australia as part of field work for her Ph.D.
“I then became fascinated with the animals and challenges in studying them, so ended up continuing the research for 23 years,” Mann said.
The study, which Mann wrote with Celine Frere, a professor at the University of Queensland in Australia, was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It appears online Nov. 1 in the PNAS Early Edition.
The two researchers wrote the study based on reproductive and behavioral data collected in Shark Bay in western Australia.
“Social experience and genes interact in complex ways, but the social effects are stronger,” Mann said in a Nov. 1 university press release.
ann and Frere looked at the life histories of 52 female dolphins, finding that social ties had a stronger impact on positive reproduction efforts than did familial ties.
“Dolphins have long-term bonds that last for decades. It is likely females and their calves learn from each other about where to hunt or avoid predators such as tiger sharks. Females may also protect each other and their calves from shark attack,” Mann said in the release.
“Female reproduction, calf development, social bonds and foraging ecology are my main areas of interest. Specifically, I am interested in what factors contribute to calf survival and female reproduction,” Mann said to THE HOYA.
In a study published earlier this year the two researchers found that dolphins can be susceptible to inbreeding, reducing reproductive output.
A BBC2 documentary about Mann’s work, “Dolphins of Shark Bay,” premiered in the UK on Nov. 2, and will air on the Discovery Channel next year.

Members of the Georgetown community came together to learn about and engage one another on the topic of global development at the UNICEF conference on Friday night.
This was the eighth year that the conference, which involves a variety of international organizations, was held. The theme of this year’s conference, “Millennium Development Goals,” entailed a series of objectives regarding development and poverty alleviation set by the United Nations to be accomplished by 2015.
“We wanted a topic that focused the discussion a little bit, but at the same time we wanted the topic to be broad enough to invite a wide variety of speakers,” UNICEF-Georgetown Vice President Nate Barker (SFS ’12) said about the theme for the conference.
“A lot of people at Georgetown are socially aware and want to help in some way, and I think that this makes the Millennium Development Goals important because they provide a focus, an educated way to help the world,” Barker said.
The conference consisted of two sessions of workshops and a formal dinner. The workshops covered a variety of subjects related to development: food security and agriculture, governance and anti-corruption, microfinance, business and development, international health, human rights, sustainability, aid effectiveness and field work.
“It’s a way to hear about what’s going on in the field and how students can make a difference,” Barker said.
Each workshop was moderated by a member of UNICEF-Georgetown and contained a panel of experts in the field being discussed. Speakers came from members of the Georgetown faculty, the World Bank, the Peace Corps and various other nongovernmental organizations and government agencies. Georgetown alumni were prominent among the speakers.
“The students do a great job of reaching out to people in the Georgetown network to identify people who can come and tell a range of different stories,” panelist Meg MacWhirter (SFS ’05) said.
acWhirter, one of the alumni invited to speak at the conference, spoke on the Field Work panel about her experience as a Peace Corps community development volunteer in Grenada. She now works with the Office of the President to support global initiatives sponsored by the university.
acWhirter said she believes that she shares her interest in international issues with many Georgetown alumni.
“Whether it’s through the Peace Corps or employment opportunities or study abroad there are already so many Georgetown students who explore international opportunities,” she said.
Conference attendee Amy Guillotte (SFS ’12) said she felt that this interest is characteristic of students as well as alumni. “It’s kind of a testament to Georgetown that there are 50 people in this room on a Friday afternoon who want to discuss a kind of academic issue,” she said.
Following the workshops was a formal dinner in Copley Formal Lounge. At the dinner, students sat at a table with one of the panelists and a member of UNICEF-Georgetown.
“You can go to a lot of events where you can hear someone speak on a topic, but when you have a chance to sit at a table [and] talk more informally with them, it gives you a chance to ask questions more than just what they think you want to hear,” Barker said. “It offers a level of personalization and a chance to really hear some things that you may not get with a larger panel discussion.”
The keynote address of the conference was given at the dinner by Patrick Finevice president of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a U.S. government foreign aid agency that provides large scale grants to developing countries.
“International development is not the top- paying profession in the world. But it’s the best profession in the world,” Fine said in his address.
“The fact that you’re here on a Friday night shows passion,” he said. “I hope you will all take that same passion and go out into the world [and] make the world a better place.”

Just days after handily winning the D.C. mayoral election, Vincent Gray named a group of advisers to help him through the transition period before his inauguration. And at least four members of the team have ties to Georgetown.
Gray won the general mayoral election on Nov. 2, after defeating incumbent mayor Adrian Fenty in the Democratic Primary in September. Gray will be inaugurated on Jan. 2.
Two of the advisers will come from the Law Center, according to the Georgetown Dish, a neighborhood blog. Robert Spagnoletti (LAW ’87), a former adjunct professor and D.C. lawyer, will concentrate on law and public safety, and Peter Edelman, a Georgetown law professor, will advise Gray on health and human services.
Individuals from the main campus also have a hand in the transition process. Alice Rivlin, a fiscal policy expert and visiting professor at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, will work on budgetary issues. Maria Gomez (NHS ’77), who runs a citywide network of nonprofit health clinics, will partner with Edelman on health and human service issues.
Not all of Gray’s first week has been smooth, however. On election night, he lost almost a quarter of the mayoral vote to Fenty in a write-in campaign. Fenty did not actually support the write-in campaign, but members of his staff aided volunteers.
Gray has also drawn controversy because of his seeming support of organizations and people who owe back taxes. He held his election-night victory party at Love, a nightclub in northeast D.C. that owes the city around $860,000 in taxes, and selected Reuben Charles, a fundraiser for Gray who owes the state of Illinois more than $200,000, to head his transition team.
Over the weekend, Gray was also heavily criticized for missing the funeral of Paul Dittamo, a police officer killed in an on-duty car crash, and instead breaking bread with Kwame Brown, the new chair of the D.C. Council. Gray said that his staff had forgotten the event.

This summer, it was hard to go anywhere without seeing wrists bedecked with the colorful and creatively shaped rubber bracelets known as Silly Bandz. Now, Georgetown students can add a new Silly Band to their collection: Jack the Bulldog.
Building on one of the summer’s biggest trends, Alpha Kappa Psi, the business fraternity, is selling Georgetown-themed bands through Dec. 31.
“It’s a new fad we hope to capitalize on,” Simon Crocker (COL ’11), president of AKPsi, said. “Not only are they a great way to show school pride, they are also a popular fashion item.”
Each package of four, which contains two bulldogs and two Georgetown G’s – one blue and one gray of each – can be purchased for $3 at a table in Red Square, the Leavey Center, The Midnight Mug or online.
“I would definitely buy them, especially because they are kind of unconventional,” Ricki Eshman (COL ’14) said.
The money raised will fund the fraternity’s professional and philanthropic events, as well as travel expenses for the group.
