Bangladeshi Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and GrameenBank founder Muhammad Yunus discussed his lifelong goal of reducing global poverty and promoting economic and social opportunities Wednesday afternoon.
Speaking to a packed crowd of students and dignitaries — including former President of Kyrgyzstan Roza Otunbayevaand former first lady of South Africa Thobeka Madiba-Zuma — Yunus graced Gaston Hall for the fourth time, shortly after receiving the Congressional Gold Medal for pioneering efforts to reduce global poverty. Yunus is the only person in the world to have received the trifecta of the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.
Since Yunus founded it 30 years ago, Grameen Bank, amicrofinance organization and community development bank based in Bangladesh, has grown to include about 8.4 million borrowers, 96 percent of whom are women, and has a 97 percent return rate. More than 250 institutions and nearly 100 countries now also offermicrocredit services modelled on the Grameen Bank system, which provides loans to individuals and entrepreneurs who are too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans.
Yunus explained his unique approach to poverty eradication, which differs from the work of nonprofit organizations and charities.
“I try to solve the problem by creating a business,” Yunus said.
University President John J. DeGioia praised Yunus’ work and challenged the audience to take up his cause at the event, which was co-sponsored by the Institute for Women, Peace and Security, the Master’s Program for Global Human Development, the Office of the President and the Yunus Centre.
“He reminds us through his words and actions that it is up to us all to enrich and expand the context of those now in poverty to create fertile grounds so [that] they can fulfill their potential and claim their rightful place in the global community,” DeGioia said.
Yunus’ approach inverts the traditional business goal of making money, instead aiming to solve problems by creating social businesses, which are non-dividend companies that reinvest profits to address social needs.
Grameen Bank’s willingness to deal directly with women also diverges from traditional banking practices in Bangladesh, which have prevented women from learning how to handle money.
“When the woman says, ‘I do not know what to do with money; I am afraid of money,’ always remember it is not her voice,” Yunus said. “It is the voice of the history which created the fears of money.”
According to Yunus, vast improvements in women’s health and dropping birthrates in Bangladesh, which have helped put Bangladesh on track to achieve the first United Nations Millennium Development Goal of cutting poverty in half by 2015, are testaments to Grameen Bank’s success.
“That basket case has now become strong,” Yunus said in reference to former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’s characterization of Bangladesh as a “basket case.”
Yunus described the powerful cocktail of imagination, ideas and technology as being pivotal to his success.
“All you need to change the world is an idea, not money,” he said. “If you imagine, it will happen.”
The Hilltop Microfinance Initiative, a student group founded in 2008, embraces Yunus’ approach to poverty eradication by providing small business loans and business consulting services to low-income entrepreneurs and immigrants who are ineligible for traditional loans.
HMFI Chief Operating Officer Dawn Chan (SFS ’14) said that Yunus’ work inspired the HMFI’smission.
“Yunus’ theory and what he is pushing for [are] what we are doing now,” she said. “We try to empower people by giving them financial opportunities.”

For current and former residents of Darnall and HarbinHalls, this weekend will be full of dorm-specific activities. The groups will celebrate the third annual Eleanor DarnallDay on Saturday and the newly revived Harbin Day on Friday, respectively. But students who lived in New South Hall or Village C will be involved in no such celebrations.
Craig Melcher (MSB ’13), Murphy Kate Delaney (COL ’13), Chris Yedibalian (COL ’13) and Mike Appau (COL ’13), who attended the last Harbin Day as freshmen in spring 2010, pushed to re-establish the event, which will take place on Harbin Patio tonight.
“It was an awesome memory of being outside and hanging out with your friends and we wanted to bring that back for us in our senior year and provide that to the freshmen as well,” Melcher said.
Melcher said that there is no connection between the events in the two dormitories. Harbin Day, originally founded in 2007, has not been held for two years, whereas Darnall residents have only been celebrating the birthday of Eleanor Darnall, Georgetown founder John Carroll’s mother, since 2011. Both current and former residents are invited to the celebration.
“It’s to bring everyone together, upperclassmen to freshmen,” Vice President of Event Planning forDarnall Hall Robert Iannaccone (NHS ’16) said. “It’s also to celebrate how great Darnall is. [Darnall] has a reputation [for] being one of the worst dorms, but you form close relationships and really enjoy it.”
Some freshmen in New South and Village C objected to the absence of celebrations in those dorms.
“Residence hall celebration days should be something for all of the dorms, not just some of them,” Village C West resident Zoe Rosen (COL ’16) said. “VCW should work to have one next year.”
On the other hand, Riya Modi (COL ’16), a New South resident, did not think that a New South Day would be necessary.
“Every day is New South Day, so I don’t really mind,’ Riya Modi (COL ’16) said. “But if there was one, I probably would stop by for some free food and to hang out with everyone.”
InterHall Council, the Students of Georgetown Inc.’s philanthropy committee and WGTB will fundHarbin’s celebration. Since this year’s celebration was due to the efforts of its organizers, it is not certain whether a Harbin Day will be held next year.
Though Darnall Day is open to all of the hall’s current and past residents, Harbin Day is only open to freshmen residents and seniors who lived in Harbin.
“We hope it will be a good memory to wrap up the freshman year specific to their residence hall,”Melcher said. “It’s kind of a way to wrap up the community experience.”
Jaysel Shah (SFS ’16) is excited to have the chance to celebrate with her Harbin hall mates one last time.
“I am going to miss Harbin so much after I leave, so the event would be a great way to see everyone I’ve met throughout the year,” Shah said.
Harbin’s event will feature cornhole, Frisbee and burgers from the Georgetown University Grilling Society, while Darnall’s will feature tailgate-themed activities, such as “Pie the Hall Director” and soda pong.
“I’m definitely planning on going to Harbin Day,” Zaynab Malik (COL ’16) said. “There’s nothing better than sunshine, friends and GUGS burgers.”

While the Class of 2017 will descend on the Hilltop for the second weekend in a row tomorrow to take in their first breaths of Georgetown air and meet their first friends, Facebook has been facilitating an extended kind of “meet and greet” since early action decisions were released in December.
“People are introducing themselves; it’s a nice way to get to know people before you really get to meet them and kind of see what people are like in general,” Yijing Yang (SFS ’17) said. “It’s a nice little community that formed on Facebook.”
For the third year running, the Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program, which also organizes the weekends on campus, launched an official Facebook page for the incoming freshman class. According to GAAP Board President Murphy Kate Delaney (COL ’13), the official Facebook group serves as a centralization of ad hoc groups that operated in the past.
“GAAP saw this as an opportunity to be a true resource for current students and decided to centralize the old system with an ‘official’ Facebook group for Georgetown’s accepted students,” Delaney wrote in an email. “The Facebook group facilitates many accepted students’ becoming friends on Facebook and then later friends at Georgetown.”
She added that many accepted students meet each other in person at the GAAP weekends and can find their future roommates via the Facebook group.
Many prospective students posted short biographies and bonded over common backgrounds, interests and extracurricular activities.
Jupiter El-Asmar (SFS ’17) said that he used the group to get a sense of the Georgetown student body.
“It was nice to meet some people through Facebook [whom] I didn’t know before [who] lived right in my area, and it is also pretty cool that we can meet people with similar interests right away,” El-Asmarsaid.
Abi Dila Vega (MSB ’17), a Texas native whose hometown is 90 percent Hispanic, added that she is using the group to ease her adjustment to East Coast culture.
“Where I live is sort of a bubble,” Dila Vega said. “I’m looking forward to meeting people of all types with so many different perspectives.”
While some used the group to connect with fellow prospective students, others asked for advice about whether to enroll in Georgetown, as well as campus opportunities and the student body.
“It is amazing to see how the other accepted students then manage to convince those who post their college decisions to choose Georgetown because of the reasons they have decided to choose Georgetown,” Delaney said. “The convincing component of the Facebook groups primarily exists among the accepted students themselves.”
Neil Sarma (NHS ’17), who chose Georgetown over King’s College London, said that the Facebook group played an important role in his decision.
“It was good just hearing other people’s opinions, especially since there are international students on there,” Sarma said. “It was really good to hear opinions of people [who] live in the U.K.”
Kira Lin (NHS ’17), an international student from Myanmar, said that she used the GAAP group to get a feel for both American culture and the Georgetown environment.
“Through knowing the people who will be at Georgetown, we might be able to be more confident and content about going there,” Lin said. “Sometimes, to be honest, I felt scared. Most students are from the States, and I feel [that] they tend to talk to and like each other more.”
Overall, many students said that communicating on the GAAP group helped to assure them that they would be able to make friends at Georgetown.
“Before I had been going on the GAAP Facebook group, I was worried about [whether] there would be other people who were like me and my friends or [whether] I would have any trouble making friends,”Neena Aggarwal (NHS ’17) said. “But I’ve been meeting a lot of people who are very similar to me.”
Some students are hopeful that the connections they make now could last until next year.
“It will be nice to arrive on campus in August and already know a few people,” Caroline Farr (SFS ’17) said. “It’s also a great place for discussion, from questions about the roommate search to Otto Porter’s decision to enter the draft — conversation is always flowing.”
Some current Georgetown students also post on the group to answer accepted students’ questions and provide firsthand advice.
Andrew Lyu (SFS ’16) said that he checks the GAAP group occasionally to provide information to admitted students.
“I scan for … questions that pertain to things I’m really interested in,” Lyu said.
For example, Lyu recently answered a student’s post that expressed worries that Georgetown would be overwhelmingly politically conservative.
“He talked about how Georgetown kids tend to be of a certain political thought, and I said [that] that was blatantly not true, and that Georgetown embraces political diversity,”Lyu said. “We’re in a city that is conducive to being of any political belief, and that if he really cared he should come.”
Some current students said that they found the Facebook group a good idea in theory but irritating in practice.
“It’s a good idea for people to be able to post questions,” Lena Rothfarb (COL ’16) said. “But it ended up being kind of weird with people posting questions, like, ‘Oh my God what color sheets are you bringing?’ or, ‘I’m so excited, Hoya Saxa!’ every minute, and I had to turn off the notifications for that group.”
Zahid Syed (COL ’16) agreed, but added that the 2016 group, still active among freshmen, was more useful once the school year began.
“I thought that it was really too vague and general,” he said. “The one thing that I think it’s useful for is selling basketball tickets. I thought that was an easy way to contact students and exchange tickets.”

In its eight years of existence, Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service in Qatar has implemented several technology advancement initiatives and pilot programs that appear to rival those on the main campus.
Last summer, one program at SFS-Q sought to introduce iPads to the classroom.
SFS-Q Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs and government professor Kai-Henrik Barth was one of the first to use the devices, in an effort to make his Science, Technology and International Politics course paperless.
SFS-Q Instructional Design Analyst Ginny Jones said that the iPad pilot program has elicited varied reactions from students and faculty. While some found the technology extremely advantageous to their learning, others preferred using old-fashioned textbooks.
But Qatar has also seen several other technology updates in recent years, chief among them continued updates to the school’s video classroom system, which was instituted five years ago, and the implementation of lecture captures that include video and audio.
Jones hopes that these technological advancements will offer creative ways of providing course content.
“[I hope that they will] increase active learning and change the dynamic to a more integrated, collaborative classroom environment,” Jones said.
Despite differences in technology on both campuses, Davis denied that Qatar was more advanced than the Washington campus, emphasizing that the IT Department in Qatar is an extension of Georgetown’s University Information Services.
“They are using the same infrastructure that we have,” Davis said. “They back up to our servers, and our teams speak if not weekly, daily across both campuses.”
But Davis conceded that certain aspects of SFS-Q facilitate the implementation of new technologies that could not as easily take root in D.C.
Davis said that SFS-Q is better-positioned to pilot new technologies, including the iPad initiative and a trial of the web content management software Drupal.
According to SFS-Q Chief Information Officer Johnathon Chapman, the campus’s relatively small size and young age are particularly advantageous for the implementation of new technology.
“It’s very easy to get involved with technology when you’re small and young,” he said. “As any institution becomes larger … you already have more systems that you’ve already made significant investments in, so you have a lot less justification to go off and try a new direction [of technology].”
The larger scale of the main campus, on the other hand, renders updating technology more inefficient.
“It makes it more challenging because of the decentralized nature of how we operate to try to find a solution that meets the majority of our stakeholders,” Davis said.
Another factor that distinguishes SFS-Q from the main campus is funding. Because of the smaller student body and faculty in Qatar, Jones said that technologic advancements are built into the school’s regular budget. Technology spending for main campus, however, is complicated because spending outside of UIS in other departments is nearly double that of UIS’s budget.
“There is money being spent on technology [at the main campus], but what we need to do is be smarter about where we’re making those technology investments and consider how [they benefit] Georgetown as a whole,” Davis said.
On the Washington campus, Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis indicated that the main campus is also looking to expand technology with the Technology-Enhanced Learning Initiatives.
Davis said that the program is in its early phases, with faculty currently submitting proposals to better integrate technology into the classroom experience. The initiative will move forward once a committee considers the proposals, but Davis declined to provide a further timeline.
Other projects on the main campus include the modernization of printing and the addition of Wi-Ficonnections in Healy Hall and White-Gravenor Hall. Davis hopes for the campus to have ubiquitousWi-Fi by December. An iPad pilot program with the Georgetown University Medical Center is also in its initial stages.
“We’re working to move IT at Georgetown from a service provider model to a fully integrated partner of our academic and research missions and a key facilitator of innovation at Georgetown,” Davis said.
Jones and Chapman also acknowledge that some of SFS-Q’s most recent technological innovations, such as the use of iClickers, originated on main campus. Many of their resources, such as Blackboard and the main video content sharing system, also first came into use on the Washington campus.
“We take full advantage of the resources that are provided by main campus, and, in many ways, what we do in our classrooms is not that unlike what is happening innovatively in Georgetown’s classrooms,” Jones said. “It’s very much a parallel effort.”
Chapman said that he believes that the main campus is not far behind Qatar in terms of technological advancement.
“Modernization projects are moving Georgetown, in Washington, up into the same level as and probably beyond us [at Qatar],” Chapman said. “We’ll be doing some leapfrog. We just have the advantage of being the young person here, so we’re able to do some new stuff.”

While many students already travel to Wards 7 and 8 to tutor each week for D.C. Reads and D.C. Schools Project, some will be staying closer to campus as members of Georgetown University Student Tutors, a new group that will tutor at Georgetown public schools next fall.
Lindsay Fountain (SFS ’15) and Ambika Kumar (MSB ’14) decided to found GUST after noticing a lack of after-school programming while working at Hardy Middle School in Georgetown.
“We have a lot of really good, strong tutoring programs on campus, but they are very focused. So a school like Hardy, located in beautiful Georgetown, but still experiencing those serious issues with achievement gaps, couldn’t get help,” Fountain said. “We were trying to found a very flexible, all-purpose tutoring service that will cater to schools that are interested, but don’t qualify for current Georgetown help.”
They established GUST to address this need. Kumar said that the club will focus in particular on schools with diverse student bodies.
“It was strange because you would think a school located in an affluent area like Glover Park would have the resources to fund after-school tutoring programs or students who receive private tutoring,” Kumar wrote in an email. “But because of the way public schools are getting redistricted, this is not the case at all.”
Fountain added that tutoring will become even more important with the upcoming closure of 15 D.C. public schools, the effects of which will be felt in Georgetown.
“A lot of those kids are shifted into schools like Hardy so they’re receiving an influx of kids that might come from weaker schools,” Fountain said. “We think they deserve just as much help as any other kid.”
GUST intends to hold a formal recruitment process in the fall to add to its current staff of 13 tutors. In comparison to other tutoring groups on campus, GUST will involve a less intensive time commitment.
“I was planning to try to do either D.C. Schools or D.C. Reads this coming fall, but with this new organization, I should be able to tutor without having to go far from campus which is much more convenient,” Whitney Pratt (COL ’14) said. “I appreciate and applaud those who take the time to go off campus and help children who need tutoring, especially those in other wards and parts of the city, but I haven’t been able to find enough time to do that so GUST is a way for me to contribute anyway.”
“Anyone tutoring is doing a good thing. There’s no wrong group to join. Ours we think is a little bit easier on the student schedule,” Fountain added.
Next fall Anna Dai (MSB ’15) and Meghan Anand (SFS ’15) will take over the primary leadership roles as president and treasurer, respectively.
“We just recently met altogether for the first time at our new club retreat, and I am really looking forward to working with such enthusiastic and interesting Hoyas during the upcoming year,” Dai wrote. “I can’t wait to see where this will carry us.”

To increase dialogue about the Arab-Israeli conflict, a group of Georgetown students revived J Street U, a pro-Israel, pro-peace advocacy group, this semester.
Although a chapter of J Street U was established at Georgetown in the fall of 2011, the group became inactive this fall after many of its members graduated. Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13) said that he hopes to re-establish the organization’s presence on campus before graduating in May.
According to Stirrett, J Street seeks to expand nationwide conversation about what it means to be pro-Israel in the United States and supports the two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Molly Wartenberg (SFS ’16), who grew up surrounded by heavily pro-Israel relatives and felt conflicted upon learning about the actions of the Israeli government, said that the unique message of J Street U appealed to her.
“J Street says that you can be pro-Israel in that it has the right to exist without being pro-Israel in the sense that you agree with what its government is doing,” Wartenberg said.
When current President Jake Sorrells (COL ’16) approached Wartenberg earlier this year about the idea of reviving J Street U at Georgetown, she was instantly interested in the organization.
“As he was telling me more about what J Street does, I became very excited because I didn’t realize that there was an organization out there like this, that I wasn’t an outlier and [that] other people felt the same way,” Wartenberg said.
Although members of J Street U have reached out to other campus organizations, including Students for Justice in Palestine and the Georgetown Israel Alliance, they say the organization’s message is distinct.
“I feel like you have two polar sides, with Georgetown Israel Alliance and Students for Justice in Palestine,” Wartenberg said. “I don’t think there’s much dialogue and common ground. I see J Street as a good, moderate place for discussion about the conflict without disrespecting other people’s views.”
Sorrells agreed that his organization has a narrower focus than GIA.
Stirrett said that although J Street U’s work is consistent with GIA’s, J Street’s distinct status as a separate group allows it to focus on a two-state solution.
“We definitely have a very positive working relationship with GIA. GIA is a great organization, and we very much think that we have complementary goals,” Stirrett said. “They do some political advocacy in terms of pro-Israel, but J Street U has a more specific focus on ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a two-state solution, which is probably something GIA advocates for as well, but it’s not [its] main burning issue.”
“Both J Street and GIA are very much about supporting and celebrating Israel,” Sorrells added.
However, GIA Co-Vice President Nitzan Gabai (SFS ’16), an Israeli-American who served in the Israel Defense Forces, disagreed with the strategies J Street uses to achieve its goals.
“The main idea of J Street is that it just has its own specific premise on social issues within Israel and social justice within Israeli society, solving all of the inequalities and problems that exist right now in Israel, and [it wants] to do that through lobbying and pressure from U.S. government officials,” Gabaisaid. “While I definitely want those changes that J Street is talking about to happen, I just believe that they should come from within the country, from within our own sovereign government.”
Despite the groups’ differences, Stirrett said that J Street U has a solid foundation to build on.
“I think it’s encouraging now that we have about two years of programming history,” he said. “I think we’ve been able to prove that this is not just a one-semester organization but something that can last longer.”
J Street U has held one general interest meeting so far that drew approximately 20 attendees. The group’s leaders hope to focus on building personal connections with other members of the organization.
“The first time around, we didn’t really focus too much on establishing a real community and building relationships with individuals … to really foment that group so we have a launching pad in the fall,”Sorrells said.
Georgetown J Street U also played host to the national organization’s regional workshop for the southeastern United States in February and sent several students to the J Street U national student conference in Washington, D.C., earlier this year.
Stirrett is confident that the future of J Street U is bright.
“I think that J Street U will continue to grow in size,” he said. “It provides a really important and valuable voice in the Georgetown community.”

Georgetown’s Office of Community Engagement is hiring a director of local government affairs to advocate for university goals and engage the D.C. community and expects to fill the position by the beginning of the summer.
The search began March 5 after the university created the OCE, which absorbed the responsibilities of the Office of External Affairs, in August 2012 as part of its internal restructuring designed to better engage the local community. The office seeks partnership with the surrounding community in light of tensions that erupted over the 2010 Campus Plan, and the compromise-oriented Georgetown Community Partnership that arose as part of the resolution.
“The new position will deal with those kinds of issues that are city government issues that have a direct impact for the university,” Associate Vice President for Community Engagement and Strategic Initiatives Lauralyn Lee, whose own position was formed along with the OCE, said.
The new director will keep tabs on D.C. Council activity that relates to Georgetown and work with other local universities through the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area. The director will also assess opportunities for university growth in anticipation of the university’s planned expansion to a new site in D.C. — also a product of the campus plan agreement — as well as the rewriting of zoning regulations.
Lee said that the interview process is under way.
“What I am really looking for, given our commitment to engaging the city, is someone who has experience with city government — either the legislative branch or the executive branch — someone who brings experience from all parts of the city,” Lee said.
Lee noted that she wants to the new director to have experience with broader District government, as opposed to just Wards 2 or 3 in the areas adjacent to the university, and to be receptive to student input.
“I think this person will work with the city council, work with the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, and we would love to have our students engaged with these offices,” Lee said.
To incorporate student opinion, the OCE will also hold regular office hours for students to discuss issues related to the city beginning next fall.
“The students are the bread and butter of why we are here,” Lee said. “To be able to represent students and their interests and what makes sense for the future of Georgetown really makes sense for us.”

While the Georgetown Model United Nations team frequently travels to compete, its trips are usually limited to four-hour bus rides to Yale or the University of Pennsylvania. But last month, GUMUN flew 21 hours to Melbourne, Australia, for WorldMUN, joining nearly 2,000 students from 55 countries to debate world issues.
The conference, sponsored by Harvard University, marked the first time Georgetown, the top-ranked North American team for the past two semesters, has attended a conference outside North America.
“WorldMUN … brings together the greatest assortment of college students from around the globe to engage in cultural exchange, diplomacy and cooperation,” Georgetown team member Anais Carmona(SFS ’14), who has attended 13 college Model UN conferences, said. “This one was an experience that I don’t think I will ever have in any other conference we go to, as diverse as our circuit in the [United States] is.”
During the five-day international conference, attendees represented countries in committee sessions in order to create UN resolutions, a process that involves extensive debate and compromise. For example, Tanzanian students represented Chile, while Georgetown students represented France; each had to advocate accordingly for their respective countries’ interests.
“It’s about finding out what international politics and negotiation and cooperation are really about,”Carmona said.
Team members said the largest difference between national MUN conferences and the WorldMUNevent was the award structure. According to team member Jeffrey Caso (SFS ’15), national MUNevents are known for rewarding individual team success, whereas WorldMUN rewarded those who demonstrated the best diplomacy and collaboration.
“You’re really there to foster relationships and friendships and have that cultural experience,”Carmona added.
For example, Carmona spoke of her experience with a group of Venezuelan students the week following former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez’s death.
“During lunch, we said, ‘Hey, we know this might be uncomfortable, but what is it like over there right now?’” Carmona said. “They were so happy to be able to talk about it and were so happy we were interested in it.”
In addition to debating major world issues with peers from across the globe, students also received the opportunity to explore Melbourne and to interact with each other in more casual settings.
“WorldMUN knew you only had a week in Melbourne, and they wanted you to see the city, so they would organize events at night all over the city,” Caso said. “It was very classy, and very professional. … You would see the people you had been working with all day long, and you’d say ‘Oh, I’ve seen you in a committee, you are representing Tanzania, where are you actually from?’”
Carmona said she enjoyed spending time with her fellow committee members over lunch, where they agreed to talk about anything other than Model UN.
“This is where China and France become friends, this is where we decide to meet up for dinner or before the ‘out-of-committee social experience’ that WorldMUN offers,” Carmona said. “Then, back into the grind of things for another two and a half hours —debating, caucusing, speaking and convincing the other delegates on a certain plan.”
To secure funding for the trip, the International Relations Club, which oversees GUMUN, began fundraising last year, using the Campaign for Georgetown as a model. Overall, the club received support from 12 donors, including the Office of the Provost and the Office of the President.
GUMUN attends six to seven competitions each semester. Earlier this semester, the team traveled to New Haven, Philadelphia, Montreal and San Francisco. The San Francisco conference was the team’s first trip away from the east coast.
“We are definitely a force to be dealt with,” Carmona said. “We are not only some of the best delegates on the circuit, but we also pride ourselves in being a family of Hoyas that have continued a tradition of excellence and fun.”
According to Caso, GUMUN is already looking ahead to next year’s conference, whose location has not yet been determined. Caso said that the team hopes to attend WorldMUN again, perhaps with a larger group.
“We’re going to try next year to start fundraising really early with the community, law firms, whomever we can receive donations from, because we want to make this a sustainable practice,” Caso said.

President Obama’s budget proposal, if approved by Congress, would have a mixed impact both on Georgetown’s research centers and students who benefit from federal loan programs.
Georgetown University Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming (SFS ’72) said he mostly supported the proposal, which was released April 10.
“For the most part, the president’s budget is a positive one for higher education,” Fleming said.
In the wake of cuts to education spending resulting from the August 2011 debt ceiling fight and the 2013 automatic budget cuts, Fleming said that the president’s plan provides a blueprint for compromise that could prevent further hemorrhaging in federal funding for the university.
Two main tenets whose resolutions could dissuade lawmakers from further education cuts, according to Fleming, include the closing of tax loopholes and structural changes to social programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
“A very good thing … is that the president’s budget does lay out a proposal that is designed to be the basis for a grand bargain, including both taxes and entitlement reforms,” Fleming said. “I think he deserves great credit for putting forward a plan that attempts to address that in a way that will hopefully lead to some progress.”
Despite his overall praise for the president’s plan, Fleming said that the lack of ceiling the student interest rates was concerning.
Another provision in the Obama budget that could significantly affect students is a proposed $150 million increase to the federal work-study program. The increase, however, would come with the stipulation that jobs be related to students’ field of study.
“It may be harder for institutions like Georgetown to get those kinds of jobs designed,” Fleming said.
Nonetheless, federal work-study participant Laura Caro (SFS ’16) said that she was excited about the idea of the change because it might mean she could seek more meaningful work than under the current work-study scheme.
“A lot of people in work-study are just swiping people into dorm halls, so I think forcing the university to connect the jobs to a person’s field of study is a really good choice,” Caro said. “I know the reason for me why it’s really hard to find a paid internship is that I just can’t afford to give up time where I could be making money. It would be amazing to be able to do both simultaneously.”
Fleming also noted that the Obama budget plan would restore funding for Title VI — a program that in part supports international education programs such as the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies; the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies; and the East Asia Center at Georgetown — to 66 percent of the budget before the 2011 cuts took effect.
Victor Cha, the director of the East Asia Center, had mixed opinions on the president’s initiative following the cuts that Title VI suffered as a result of the 2011 debt ceiling crisis.
“In today’s budget environment, I guess this should be applauded,” Cha wrote in an email. “But the [2011] cuts to Title VI are literally pocket change in the larger national budget-cutting context and yet they are so critically important to funding foreign language study, scholarships and teaching at the universities in the [United States] like Georgetown that are committed to training our next generation of diplomats, scholars and experts about different regions of the world.”
Another provision in the budget that could impact the lives of Georgetown students is a potential restructuring of the Perkins loan program, whose revolving loan fund ensures that student repayment is reinvested in future students. The Perkins loan program’s survival hinges on Congress’ reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, a separate measure from the budget proposal which is set to expire within the next year.
“If Congress doesn’t pass the president’s budget plan or if it doesn’t act unilaterally within the next year or so, [the program] is going to expire and that is going have major, major consequences on the lives of some students here,” Fleming said.
According to Georgetown’s Office of Student Financial Services, 824 Georgetown students during the current academic year receive funds from the Perkins program, totaling just under $5 million. The total Perkins Loan Revolving Fund at Georgetown has about $34 million.
Dupree Daniels (COL ’16) said that he most likely would not be at Georgetown without the assistance of the Perkins loan program.
“For this scholarship to be taken from me would be so detrimental to me and my family,” Daniels said. “It would be such a huge step down going on from Georgetown.”
Daniels said that he could barely imagine both the disappointment and shame he would feel if he were to lose the money he receives from the federal government.
“Going to Georgetown and having to go right back — it would be a horrible thing to tell my kids,” Daniels said.

When Conan Louis (FLL ’73) arrived at Georgetown in 1969, he was one of about 30 black students in the entire undergraduate population. There were no black members of the faculty or the administration.
Although the university admitted its first black undergraduate in 1950, almost two decades later, the student body remained overwhelmingly white. As recently as 1964, there was only one black student in the College.
“We took exception to the fact that there seemed not to be the kind of support system that was necessary for African-American students to survive and thrive at the university,” Louis said. “We sought to change that.”
Louis, along with other members of the Black Student Alliance, which was formed in 1968 and chaired at the time by Wendell Robinson (CAS ’71), decided to take action.
“We went en masse to the president’s office — without an appointment, I might add,” Louis said with a chuckle. “And the president agreed to see us, and he agreed to take steps addressing the issues that we raised.”
Out of that  meeting was born a commitment by the university to enroll more black students, recruit black faculty members and create the Black Student Alliance House — a meeting place, refuge and second home for many that has stood at the center of the university’s black community since the building’s founding in 1970.
“It literally became the center of African-American social life on campus. It was a space where almost all of us hung out in between classes, sometimes during classes,” Louis said, chuckling again. “It totally transformed the community in terms of its ability to congregate and galvanize.”
According to Dennis Williams, director of the Center for Multicultural Equity & Access and himself a student at Cornell University when the Black House was created, similar activism was going on at college campuses across the country. Many of the cultural centers, minority residence halls and ethnic studies programs that exist today were founded during this period.
Georgetown was also impacted by the movements sweeping the nation. In 1968, Martin Luther KingJr. was assassinated, and riots erupted in Washington, D.C., and across the country.
According to Louis, the BSA was swept up in the political movement of the late 1960s; in addition to working for change at the university, the group also brought D.C. politicians to campus to engage in discussion.
It was also in 1968 when Georgetown’s Community Scholars Program was established to serve underrepresented ethnic and socioeconomic groups. According to Williams, the program was the university’s first serious attempt at integration, and its early participants were mostly black students who had graduated from the D.C. public school system. The program offered support for those students both academically and financially.
In part due to the Community Scholars Program, the number of black students at Georgetown began to grow in the early 1970s. In September of 1970, The Hoya reported that 33 black students had been admitted as part of a freshman class of 1,100; in 1971, the freshman class included about 70.
“Once some of these doors were opened, there was a large push from students themselves,” Williams said.
At Georgetown, the Black Student Alliance House was at the center of these efforts to drive change.
But the house was first and foremost a gathering place for many black students. In the first several years of its existence, the house was not a residence and instead served as a meeting place and a spot for students to drop in between classes.
“There were not a lot of places you could go and see someone who looked like you,” Valerie Grasso(CAS ’75) said. Grasso was part of the first class that included a substantial number of black students and also a member of just the third class of women admitted to the College of Arts and Sciences. “What it represented for me was just this tiny oasis in the middle of campus where I could just go and relax.”
Louis’ wife Gail, who enrolled at Georgetown two years after her husband, agreed.
“If you needed to clear your head, there was a place where you could go where it was safe to do so. … When I went to class, often I was the only black person in the class, and it got a little tedious being expected to be the authority on all that was black,” she said. “But it was nice to be able to go someplace and say, ‘Can you believe what happened to me today?’”
Since many of the first black students at Georgetown were D.C. natives recruited through the Community Scholars Program, the majority of them did not live on campus, and the house was especially important to commuter students.
“There were changes going on in the university and not everyone was happy about the changes, so I think it was really important to have a place where people could go,” Gail Louis said. “The role was a great one as kind of a safe haven.”
Conan Louis recalls that the first floor was usually occupied by students relaxing between classes, playing the card game whist or catching a short nap, while the upstairs was a place to study, complete with a library of old textbooks. The house played host to events ranging from holiday meals for students who could not afford to go home during breaks to Black Student Alliance meetings to parties.
“It was important … for something as simple as the kind of music that would be played at dances and parties on campus was simply not the kind of music that we were always interested in listening to,” Conan Louis said. “And so every month, six weeks or so, there was a party at the Black House.”
It has been more than 40 years since the Black House was established, and the university has changed in many ways. Last year, 10 percent of the 3,316 admitted students were black, and the number of minority students admitted hit an all-time high.  As the university has changed, so has the Black House. After years on O Street, the house moved to its current location at 1410 36th St. NW, shortened its name from the Black Student Alliance House to the Black House and became a residence as well as a gathering place. But for many students, the house plays a similar role as it did as its founding.
Yasmin Serrato (SFS ’13), a current resident of the Black House, was first exposed to the house as a high school senior during Hoya Saxa weekend, a program that brings underrepresented admitted students of color to campus.
“The Black House was like a safe haven,” she said.
For freshmen in particular, the house can still serve as an important resource.
“It can be kind of overwhelming being a freshman or even a sophomore. The Black House just offers a safe space to have those conversations with people who may have had the same experiences as you just because of your color or the household you come from,” Sidney Wells (COL ’16) said.
Just as in the 1970s, the house is still a destination for students who want a place to study, grab a bite to eat or nap between classes.
“It’s just a resource for people who need it,” Carolyn Chambers (COL ’11), who lived in the Black House during her junior year, said. “If you need a place to watch your weekly shows or to do your homework, or if you need to take a nap on the couch, you can do that. The Black House just tries to provide whatever the community needs, whatever you can’t find anywhere else, you can probably find it at the Black House.”
Although the university has changed drastically since the 1970s, advocacy has remained an important goal of the Black House community. In the fall, it held a Haunted House event on Halloween in partnership with What’s After Dark. After the event received two visits from Student Neighborhood Assistance Program and one visit from a Metropolitan Police Department officer within its first two hours, the residents decided to file a racial bias incident report and Aya Waller-Bey (COL ’14), a current Black House resident, wrote an op-ed in The Hoya.
“It’s sad that this is a reality in Georgetown, but what we did is we raised awareness,” Serrato said. “We spoke up. As a house, we were able to make sure that people knew and that the issue was not silenced.”
David Price (COL ’14), another resident of the Black House, agreed that the house has a role to play in addressing diversity issues on campus.
“There are many Georgetowns,” he said. “It’s a broader problem, but it trickles down to a Black House problem.”
But in many ways, the house has also expanded its role on campus. According to Chambers, during her time at Georgetown, the house began to open itself up to more multicultural groups. The university’s Students of Color Alliance now holds its weekly meetings at the Black House, and one of the house’s residents is a SOCA co-chair.
“The reason we did that was to anchor that facility as a kind of meeting space for all the different student groups of color,” Williams said.
The Black House put on a town hall meeting for Georgetown University Student Association candidates to address diversity issues this February. Waller-Bey said it is one of the programs she is most proud of from this year and something she hopes will become an annual tradition.
For Serrato, a first-generation college student, the desire to spread awareness about the Black House was part of what drove her to apply to live there.
“When I realized I was actually the only Latina at an NAACP event, I was like, you know, I don’t think people are aware that this house is not just for NAACP or BSA,” she said. “That kind of sparked my interest in the Black House. I was like: ‘I want to live here. I want to make sure that other people know what Black House is.’”
The current residents co-sponsored programs with 12 different organizations last semester and held a record 22 events in the house. According to Waller-Bey, the house this year has strengthened its presence on campus as a whole.
“This year, everything has evolved, and we’ve definitely thought outside the box,” she said.
One of the programs that current residents are most proud of is a series of weekly discussions where students pick a topic, flip over an hourglass and talk until the sand runs down. Wells, a regular participant in the hourglass discussions, said the discussions have been valuable to him — although he said they would be more productive if a wider range of opinions were represented, with both more men and those of different ethnicities in attendance.
“It is a tremendous way to gain insight from your minority peers,” he said. “I find it amazing that these conversations are happening.”
Beyond its role in the community, the house has played an important role in the lives of students who lived or spent time there throughout its history.
Conan Louis, who spent most of his free time in the then-Black Student Alliance House, said what he remembers most about his time at Georgetown was his involvement in the BSA.
“I believe that it was that leadership experience that really helped to form who I was and who I became as a result of my Georgetown experience,” he said.
Louis has remained highly involved with the university, serving on the board of governors and as vice president for alumni relations.
For Chambers, living in the Black House taught her to always put the community first — even when that meant leaving the house open until late at night.
“We used to have people spending the night, staying up late doing homework, having meetings, coming in for food — all these different reasons,” she said.
Because the house has an open door policy, students are always coming in and out of the house.
“It can go from quiet study sessions, where we’re all just doing homework at the dining room table, to suddenly music playing, and a ‘Harlem shake’ video,” Serrato said. “I was literally studying at the dining room table, and next thing you know, I’m in this ‘Harlem shake’ video with these visitors, these 12 people who just showed up.”
Both Price and Waller-Bey will live in the Black House again next year, but because of university concessions to relocate Magis Row as part of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement with neighborhood groups, the house will move again next year after 20 years at 1410 down the block to 1308.
“It’s kind of like a next chapter, but to start a new chapter, you have to close the one behind it,” Serrato said.
“There’s a lot of history here,” Waller-Bey agreed.
Both Williams and the current residents hope to use the move to raise more awareness about the Black House and draw a broader range of students to its discussions.
“Originally, it was a sanctuary. It can still be that a little bit, but I think it is a little less necessary for any one place to be that,” Williams said. “It is a center of conscious activity in organization. It is place where people come together to get things done.”
