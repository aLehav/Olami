This year’s graduation festivities started with a bang Thursday afternoon as the Class of 2012 presented a record-high gift to the university during the convocation ceremony.
The $126,052.50 check, which was presented by newly elected 2012 Alumni Class Chairs Chris Butterfield (MSB ’12) and Katie Eisenstein (COL ’12), included funds raised by the Class of 2012 and a matching donation from the board of regents.
In March, an anonymous donor announced that he or she would donate an additional $1 million to the university if more than 68 percent of seniors contributed to the class gift. The Class of 2012 exceeded this benchmark by 2 percent, setting a record at 70 percent participation.
Provost James O’Donnell opened the convocation ceremony, which was held in McDonough Arena. Megan Hickey (COL ’12) led a performance of the national anthem, and Vice President for Mission and Ministry Kevin O’Brien, S.J., and former Jewish Student Association President Samantha Sisskind (SFS ’12) led prayers.
The convocation address was given by Helen O’Reilly (SFS ’03), who has worked to provide legal advice for children with disabilities in New York and was granted a Luce Scholarship to spend two years advocating for factory workers’ rights in the Philippines. Her speech encouraged seniors to reflect on their core values in their post-college lives. The address was followed by the presentation of the class gift, after which Butterfield and Eisenstein led their peers in affixing class pins to one another’s robes to represent their official membership in the Georgetown alumni network.
Muslim Students Association member Wan Muhamad Nazhif Wan Yusoff (SFS ’12) gave the benediction before the closing recessional concluded convocation.
Official commencement festivities will continue through Sunday. Today’s graduation ceremonies present diplomas on behalf of all the graduate programs — other than the School of Medicine and the Law Center — and will take place on Healy Lawn.
The night before Saturday’s undergraduate commencement ceremonies, seniors and their guests are invited to attend the Senior Ball at Union Station. This year, the Senior Ball Committee hired a D.C. Circulator bus to take attendees back to the Georgetown area at the end of the night.
“The lessons the [Senior Class Committee] has learned throughout the year have really made the week the best that it’s going to be. Senior Ball will be an incredible culmination of all that,” Butterfield, the Senior Class Committee chair, said.
Undergraduate commencement ceremonies will begin with the Georgetown College graduation, followed by the School of Nursing and Health Studies, the Walsh School of Foreign Service and the McDonough School of Business. There are 1,868 seniors graduating, including students from the School of Foreign Service campus in Qatar. The valedictorians addressing their classes will be Nadia Mahmassani (COL ’12), Alison Lauter (NHS ’12), Anton Strezhnev (SFS ’12) and Perry Rogers (MSB ’12).
For many seniors, this weekend’s festivities will offer an opportunity to join together with old friends and reflect on their shared experiences.
“In some instances, you see the faces of people you met for orientation. Instead of meeting new people, you’re reconnecting with them,” Marzena Zukowska (SFS ’12) said.
Every year, deans of the respective schools organize the speakers for each ceremony. This year’s speakers range from journalist and “The Wire” producer David Simon, who will speak before the College, to LivingSocial founder and CEO Tim O’Shaughnessy, who will speak at the commencement ceremony for the McDonough School of Business.
The weekend’s festivities end Sunday with the Baccalaureate Mass, commencement brunch and the School of Medicine and Law Center graduation ceremonies.
Director of Academic Events Meghan Hogge estimates that in total, there will be tens of thousands of guests on campus for the weekend’s events. There are 7,500 chairs set up for guests on Healy Lawn, but some ceremonies, including the College and Law Center graduations, feature additional standing room.
According to Karen Frank, vice president for facilities and student housing, there are approximately 350 commencement guests — 100 fewer than last year — staying on campus in Village C West, Harbin and New South Halls.

Mayor Vincent Gray’s proposed legislation to keep District bars open until 3 a.m. on weekdays and 4 a.m. on weekends was rejected in a 3-2 vote by the D.C. Council’s Committee on Human Services earlier this month.
The proposed legislation was intended to increase revenue for local bars and sales tax intake for the D.C. government. Gray estimated that with the additional hours, total revenue would increase by $3.2 million, with $1.2 million of that total coming in sales tax revenue.
Representatives of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, which includes the university and Georgetown neighborhood, lauded the outcome, given concerns that the proposed legislation would leave customers stranded without adequate public transportation home and residential areas vulnerable to excessive late-night noise pollution.
“All patrons that leave bars at 4 a.m. are inherently loud. It’s one thing to wake up at 3 a.m. or 3:30 and go back to bed, but after being woken up at 4 a.m. or 4:30 it’s much harder to go back to sleep,” ANC Commissioner Bill Starrels, also a representative on the D.C. Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration, said.
The proposal’s failure means that bars will have to find another way to generate the sought-after revenue. Three councilmembers have proposed an additional 6-cent excise tax on drinks.
Gray’s spokeswoman Doxie McCoy emphasized that Gray was hopeful the council could increase revenue without raising taxes.
“The mayor said there would be no tax increases this year and there still won’t be,” she said.
Despite rejecting the extended hours, councilmembers affirmed two other parts of Gray’s alcohol proposals. Bars will be allowed to stay open until 4 a.m. on the night of the presidential inauguration every four years and liquor stores, grocery stores and wholesale alcohol vendors will be allowed to open at 7 a.m., two hours earlier than they are allowed to open at present, every day except Sunday.

Contrary to recent media speculation, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital does not have plans to move to Capitol Crossing, a new development being constructed near Interstate 395 in downtown D.C.
The Washington Post reported on April 29 that the hospital and medical school could be moving to the new site, which is across the street from Georgetown University Law Center.
The article noted that other university departments such as the Law School, the Georgetown Public Policy Institute and the School of Continuing Studies were also considering moving to the development, which is owned by the New York-based real estate agency Property Group Partners.
According to MedStar Georgetown University Hospital Director of Media Relations Marianne Worley, however, there have been no discussions to move the hospital.
“There has been some speculation in the media recently about the possibility of MedStar Georgetown University Hospital relocating from the Georgetown University campus to another area of the city. We want to assure you that this is not the case,” she wrote in an email.
As for rumors that the hospital might expand its current on-campus location, Worley remained vague about any potential plans.
“As we look forward, we will continue to build world-class services across MedStar’s Washington region, including hospital-based services on the Georgetown University campus on Reservoir Road, MedStar’s other hospital campuses across the region and our extensive ambulatory and physician locations on behalf of our patients,” she wrote.
University spokeswoman Stacy Kerr said that as the university sold the hospital in 2000 to MedStar Health, she could not speak for MedStar administrators regarding their future plans. However, Kerr said rumors speculating that the hospital might build on Kehoe Field are not true.
“Kehoe Field is owned and managed by the university,” she said. “There are no plans for the hospital to take over that space at this time.”
Kerr also added that any changes to the current hospital facilities would be difficult to implement.
“The hospital facilities north of Kehoe Field are subject to a long-term lease, and any proposed development of those areas would not only be subject to the provisions of the lease but [also] the campus plan,” she said.
Although the hospital will remain in Georgetown, the campus still faces problems accommodating its academics and students in its current space.
Kerr said that the university is looking at multiple locations in the D.C. metropolitan area for an expansion of its graduate programs and that the Capitol Crossing development is one of the locations being considered.
PGP Regional Vice President Robert Braunohler said that while the school has talked with developers about purchasing part of the property, where construction is expected to begin during summer 2013, nothing has been decided.
“It’s just a possibility … at this point. There’s no firm decision as far as we understand it,” he said. “It’s among the options they’re looking at. They’re looking very seriously at it, but at this point, there are no commitments, nothing definite to say either way.”

More than two weeks after the clock hands on the front face of Healy Tower went missing, the mystery of who took them remains largely unsolved.
After confirming the theft of the front hands, which went missing April 30, the university removed the set on the back of Healy Tower to assess damage to the clock and reinstall dismantled security systems.
The following week, on May 8, the university replaced the missing hands on the front face of the clock with a spare pair that had previously been kept in storage. The hands on the back face of the clock were reinstalled at the same time.
According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, damages totaled about $9,000.
Stealing the clock hands from Healy Tower is a long-standing tradition whose frequency has decreased in recent years. In the 1960s, the hands were stolen so frequently that the university stopped replacing them between thefts.
The hands were most recently stolen by Andrew Hamblen (SFS ’07) and Wyatt Gjullin (COL ’09) in 2005. After a two-week investigation by the Department of Public Safety, the two students admitted to climbing construction scaffolding and entering the tower through a broken window.
Hamblen and Gjullin were placed on academic probation and assigned 75 and 100 community service hours, respectively, though expulsion was initially considered.
“When I learned of the tradition of stealing the Healy clock hands freshman year and [after] reading various publications about the history associated with the tower, I decided that I eventually wanted to contribute to the survival of the tradition before I graduated,” Hamblen told The Hoya at the time. “I intended no destruction or ill will to the university in taking the hands, simply to contribute to one aspect of what makes this a special place.”

Despite outrage from a variety of religious and pro-life groups, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius is still set to speak at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute’s Tropaia awards ceremony.
In a letter to the Georgetown community released Monday, University President John J. DeGioia emphasized that the invitation is not an endorsement of Sebelius’ political views and will not be rescinded.
Secured as a speaker in January before the Obama administration’s announcement regarding the modified health care regulations, Sebelius was chosen due to her accomplishments in public policy, according to Tropaia Chair Julia Druhan (GRD ’12).
Sebelius served as the second female governor of Kansas from 2003 to 2009. After being appointed HHS secretary in 2009, she played a large role in crafting the Obama administration’s health care legislation.
“We didn’t invite her for political reasons. We invited her because we wanted someone who is qualified to talk to public policy students about public service,” Druhan said.
After accepting the invitation from GPPI, Sebelius took a lead role in the HHS contraception mandate, which requires religiously affiliated institutions like Georgetown to provide contraceptive coverage to students and employees. But according to Druhan, event organizers do not think Sebelius’s speech will focus on the HHS mandate and the ensuing controversy.
The May 4 announcement that Sebelius would be speaking accelerated the already controversial debate about how the contraception mandate will be implemented at Georgetown.
Professor Patrick Deneen, the former director of the Tocqueville Forum who will resign to pursue a position at the University of Notre Dame before the beginning of the fall semester, wrote a letter to DeGioia asking him to rescind the invitation.
According to the letter, Deneen believes that hosting Sebelius at a commencement ceremony signifies Georgetown’s endorsement of the HHS mandate. Eight other Georgetown faculty members signed the letter.
In his letter to the Georgetown community, DeGioia wrote that the university disassociates itself from positions that conflict with the traditional church teachings due to its Catholic and Jesuit roots and therefore does not endorse the HHS mandate. He argued the importance of Georgetown’s acting as a forum for the free exchange of ideas.
University spokeswoman Stacy Kerr added that Sebelius was invited to speak for her role in public policy, not as a political statement.
“The Georgetown Public Policy Institute chose her as a policy leader, and [the university] regularly has high-profile speakers who come to campus, and their presence on campus does not mean that [the university] endorses their opinion,” Kerr said.
Despite this clarification, the Archdiocese of Washington released a statement Tuesday claiming that Sebelius’s speaking engagement at Georgetown was a challenge to the Church as a whole.
In addition, a petition written by President Patrick J. Reilly of the Cardinal Newman Society — a group that aims to “renew and strengthen Catholic identity in Catholic higher education,” according to its website — has received over 27,000 signatures.
“It is scandalous and outrageous that America’s oldest Catholic and Jesuit university has elected to provide this prestigious platform to a publicly ‘pro-choice’ Catholic. … The contrast is stark between Georgetown University and those faithful Catholic colleges and universities that have stood for faith and freedom,” the petition reads.
DeGioia emphatically negated these statements in his letter, noting that the invitation was extended and accepted before the debate over the HHS mandate began.
“I’m not sure why having a speaker who took a stance that is different from the university’s disqualifies [her] as a speaker,” H*yas for Choice spokesman Brad Crist (SFS ’12) said. “The university, especially a Catholic one, doesn’t have to share the same views as a speaker. Georgetown is an institution where we value diverse thought, so it would be a great place to have a pro-choice candidate speaking.”
Georgetown Right to Life acknowledged that the invitation is not an endorsement of the contraceptive mandate, though it does pose a timing problem.
“I don’t think we should bring her to speak when this is such a controversial issue,” former Right to Life President Joseph Cardone (COL ’14) said.
The students and faculty of GPPI sent separate letters to DeGioia on Wednesday, clarifying their intentions in choosing Sebelius as a speaker and maintaining support for the invitation. Later that day, the editorial board of The Washington Post praised DeGioia for allowing Sebelius to speak.
“The Georgetown community, Catholics and non-Catholics alike, should be proud of its president’s defense of open-minded debate,” the editorial read.

Plans for the construction of the New South Student Center took a leap forward this month after the NSSC Committee chose the architecture firm ikon.5 to design the new space.
The firm, based in Princeton, N.J., specializes in designing facilities for colleges and other academic institutions. It was selected through a competitive bidding process administered by the committee and is now negotiating a contract with the university.
“With ikon.5, we really sensed their ability and interest in working with students,” Zachary Singer (SFS ’15), student member of the NSSC Committee, said.
According to Singer, ikon.5 impressed the committee with plans to incorporate student input in the design process. The firm plans to hold creative meetings with students throughout the summer in D.C. and other major cities.
Principal architect Joseph Tattoni described his vision for the new student space as focused on the building’s view of the river.
“We see it as a blank canvas. There are so many opportunities with this project because it is one of the few buildings that has a great view of the Potomac,” he said.
Tattoni explained that in Georgetown’s early days, most of the university’s buildings faced the river, which served as the main view and focal point for campus architecture. Fr. Patrick Healy, S.J., the university’s 29th president, then decided that Georgetown should face the city and altered the campus’s design focus to that end.
Once contract negotiations are finalized, ikon.5 will begin working to design a space that can fit into the existing infrastructure of New South Hall, including the piping and underground work already in place. Renovation plans must also take into consideration the fact that the building’s residents must continue to live in New South during construction.
According to Tattoni, the design process will move along an accelerated timeline so that the new space can open by fall 2014.
“The university wants us to move very quickly on this,” Tattoni said. “Typically, projects of this scale take a year to design, but this project will most likely move more quickly.”
As construction plans develop, discussions have already begun about potential tenants for several available vendor spots to be included in the new facility.
Only Students of Georgetown, Inc. has confirmed plans to apply for a new location in the center. The student-run business also posted a poll on its blog May 6 asking customers what kind of new venue they would like to see. Options included a salad shop, smoothie shop, deli, bakery and coffee shop. Results were not available for public viewing.
“We see this space as a chance to be innovative and challenge ourselves, as a way to bring something new to campus while at the same time delivering a high-quality product,” CEO of The Corp Michael West wrote in a statement to the press.
In addition to vendor spaces, the university has committed to providing room in the new facility to house a pub, community room and open study space.
Tattoni said his main goal for the designs will be creating a useful and meaningful student space that will last for generations.
“We know the whole history and love and memory of the old pub and student activity space that was in Healy Hall,” he said. “We hope to get at the spirit of what that was all about.”

In the wake of a year’s worth of controversy surrounding Georgetown’s Catholic identity, a prominent alum is challenging the university’s right to be affiliated with the Catholic Church and the Society of Jesus.
Academy Award winner William Peter Blatty (C ’50), best known as the novelist and screenwriter responsible for “The Exorcist,” announced plans today for the creation of The Father King Society to Make Georgetown Honest, Catholic and Better. The organization, which is named for the late Fr. Thomas King, S.J., of the theology department, intends to petition the Catholic Church to strip Georgetown of the ability to describe itself as Catholic or Jesuit in fundraising and informational materials.
Though the organization was planned before the announcement of Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius as the speaker at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute’s Tropaia awards ceremony, the development prompted Blatty to launch his initiative this week.
“This is simply the last straw,” Blatty said. “The scandals that Georgetown has given to the faithful are too many to count and too many to ignore any longer.”
The Father King Society is now threatening the university with a canon law action, a lawsuit filed within the Catholic Church. The outcome will be judged by archbishops and possibly the Vatican.
This is not Georgetown’s first encounter with canon law action. In 1991 and 1992, then Dean of Students John J. DeGioia came under fire as dean of students for authorizing university funding for GU Choice, the predecessor to current pro-choice advocacy group H*yas for Choice. Catholic alums quickly organized in response, filing a canon law action with the Archdiocese of Washington. Cardinal James Hickey deferred the matter to the Vatican. Threatened with the removal of Georgetown’s Catholic affiliation, then-President Fr. Leo J. O’Donovan, S.J., reversed DeGioia’s decision upon his return from Rome.
Blatty’s Father King Society has close ties with the Cardinal Newman Society of Washington, which called on Georgetown to cancel the Sebelius address in a Wednesday Washington Post opinion piece by organization founder, President and CEO Patrick Reilly.
Reilly said he supports Blatty’s initiative as a last resort to address what he sees as Georgetown’s noncompliance with Catholic teachings.
“We’re thrilled that … Blatty has invited us to assist him and others in their efforts to defend Georgetown’s Catholic mission from those who would undermine or abandon it,” he said. “Such intervention is necessary only because Georgetown’s leadership has repeatedly demonstrated its unwillingness to uphold Georgetown’s obligations under canon law.”
Blatty stressed that he aims to return the university to its Catholic roots.
“In the months to come, The Father King Society will ask Georgetown and the Church for explanations and decisions,” he said. “It grieves me that Georgetown University today almost seems to take pride in insulting the Church and offending the faithful.”
