Benjamin Todd Jealous, president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, called for the Millennial generation to advance the cause of social justice during an event in St. William’s Chapel Tuesday evening.
Jealous impressed upon the audience that devotion and determination lead to success. He gave several examples of the NAACP’s tenacity in decades-long campaigns for the end of lynch mobs, segregation, capital punishment and voter discrimination.
“Today, I’m not going to talk about the easy things. I’m not going to talk about the three-year plan or the five-year plan,” Jealous said. “We [the NAACP] will claim our victory in advance — and we will — and get it done simply because we are willing to go the distance to get it done.”
According to Jealous, this determination is grounded in faith in both God and secular morals.
“We exist, all of us, in a context of faith,” Jealous said. “Whether that’s a secular faith — someone who does not believe in God but has faith in humanity — or whether that’s the many of us in this country … who do believe in God. And that faith, however you define it, is ultimately what makes us so powerful.”
Jealous added that many of the pressing issues facing this generation, ranging from inequality in education to the New York Police Department’s Stop-and-Frisk program, must be met with determination, frank discussion and prompt action.
“Our job is to make this land of opportunity the land of opportunity for all of America’s children,” he said.
Jealous warned that acceptance of racism as a societal norm inhibits progress toward social justice.
“We never talk about racism to make life better for us — we always deal with racism,” Jealous said.
The event also featured reflections from Minister Wendy Hamilton of Protestant Ministries and from members of Georgetown NAACP.
Mikaela Ferrill (COL ’15) described the NAACP’s continued importance to her and her community both at home and at Georgetown.
“I was really excited for this event because, as a member of the NAACP, I think it’s really important for us to be able to be in touch with President Benjamin Jealous,” Ferrill said.
Casey Gery (COL ’14) asked Jealous to elaborate on the day-to-day role college students can play in the social justice movement in a question-and-answer session.
“I think the greatest thing about what the president said was things that we can actually do. Because we can be fired up and ready to go, but if you don’t know which way to go or what you’re going to do, you won’t be productive in society,” Gery said.
“He gave people something to think about, but also something to act on.”

Epicurean and Co. proprietor Chang Wook Chon pled guilty to the charge of criminal contempt for violating a court order issued during a civil lawsuit in a status hearing March 7.
According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office spokesperson Bill Miller, the charge carries a maximum of one year in prison, a potential fine and other penalties.
This is the latest development in the USA v. Chon case, which began in 2010 with a lawsuit against Chon for violating the Fair Labor Standards Act by withholding four Epicurean employees’ overtime work payment. Chon’s inappropriate conduct in the civil case, which allegedly included threats to the plaintiffs during the proceedings, led to a criminal case, causing the original case to be put on hold.
Chon entered into a four-month deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office; if the agreement is followed, the office will ask the court to dismiss the case without entering a judgment of conviction.
Per the agreement, Chon must obey all federal, state or local laws, cannot contact plaintiffs from the various civil cases he is involved in, must donate $2,500 to a nonprofit providing employment training and placement and must comply with any additional court orders or rulings. In addition, Chon must pay a $50 special assessment fee to the court.
If Chon breaks the agreement, however, he would be sentenced according to original guilty plea.
A follow-up status hearing is set for July 9, until which time Chon will remain free on personal recognizance of his guilt.
“The hearing in July will likely assess if he met terms of the agreement, and if so, the charge could be dismissed,” Miller said.
According to Darin Dalmat of James & Hoffman, the law firm representing one of the employees in the civil suit, Chon has not contacted the plaintiffs about resuming the civil case proceedings but expressed an interest in moving ahead during previous status hearings in the criminal case.
“Certainly, we welcome the opportunity to move forward with the civil case and wrap it up as soon as possible,” Dalmat said.
Dalmat added that the criminal contempt was one of several instances of inappropriate conduct by Chon.
“We thought that Chon had engaged in a variety of bad conduct,” Dalmat said. “The confession of guilty to this goes to one aspect of that conduct … but we had brought to the court’s attention many, many other instances of that conduct — threats of retaliation in terms of firing, monitoring communication with attorneys, threatening to call immigration.”
But overall, Dalmat was satisfied with the outcome of the criminal proceedings.
“I’m just glad that Chon has accepted responsibility for his conduct with respect to the court, and I hope he will, in short order, get responsibility with respect to conduct with employees.”
Barry Coburn of Coburn & Greenbaum, the law firm representing Chon, could not be reached for comment.

Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio became the first South American and Jesuit pope of the Roman Catholic Church after 115 cardinals selected him as the 266th pontiff earlier today.
Bergoglio, 76 years old, was introduced as Pope Francis I by Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran soon after white smoke began billowing from the roof of the Sistine Chapel.
In his address from St. Peter’s Basilica, Francis thanked the crowds gathered in St. Peter’s Square as well as the cardinals, saying that they “have chosen one from far away, but here I am.”
Electing the Argentinian Jesuit on the fifth ballot, the conclave — which began on Tuesday — was  the fastest in years and contradicted the lack of clear front-runner going into the vote and the unpredictability of Pope Benedict XVI’s resignation, the first in 600 years.
While Benedict was elected on the fourth ballot in 2005, he was the cardinals’ top pick even before the vote.
As Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis was well known for his modesty, simplicity and poverty as he traveled on buses through his country and took trips of compassion to visit HIV and AIDS patients in 2001, where he kissed and washed the feet of those affected by the disease.
