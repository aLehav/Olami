President Obama called for the allocation of $165 billion to federal student aid in the proposed budget for fiscal year 2013 released Monday.
According to Georgetown’s Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming, the number represents an $11.5 billion jump from fiscal year 2012. Education spending saw the largest increase among all federal discretionary budget categories this year, Fleming said.
“I think the funding levels are good, especially given the budget constraints,” he said. “[They show] the president’s serious commitment to education as an important contributor to getting our economy in order.”
Federal funding for education is especially important to Georgetown students, who received $25.6 million in federal financial aid during the 2010-2011 school year.
The proposed budget includes $36.1 billion for Pell Grants, $1.1 billion for Federal Work Study and $8.5 billion for the Perkins Loan Program, all of which are major components of students’ financial aid packages. During the 2010-2011 academic year, 952 Georgetown students were awarded Pell Grants, 1,954 earned Federal Work-Study funding and 546 received Perkins Loans.
“This is the first year in many years [the nation] hasn’t been facing a shortfall in funding for the Pell Grant Program,” Fleming said.
But Georgetown’s ability to access new funding will be contingent on Obama’s newly announced Race to the Top program, which ties federal dollars to the cost of a university’s tuition. In this program, colleges will be graded according to their total costs, graduation rates, student loan repayment rates, average student loan debt and graduates’ earning potential.
Fleming worried that Obama’s new rules might lead to a decrease in the amount Georgetown receives for student aid based on the school’s high tuition.
Undergraduate tuition for fiscal year 2013 will rise to $42,360, a 3.5 percent increase over the current rate of $40,920.
“If they start fiddling with the formula, I don’t want our students to lose access to loans,” Fleming said. “It’s my feeling that we have a very good approach to making Georgetown an affordable institution for students of all economic levels … and I will do everything in my power to make sure that there aren’t some unintended consequences of what they’re doing that would undermine what we think is a very successful model.”
Obama also called for Congress to extend the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which caps interest rates on student loans at 3.5 percent. The law is due to expire July 1, after which rates would go up to 6.8 percent.
According to Fleming, neither Democrats nor Republicans have made much headway in making sure the act is extended.
“There will be some partisan back-and-forth about this and … I am not ready to predict the outcome,” he said.
The budget Obama laid out Monday must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate in order to become law. According to Fleming, it could be months before the budget is finalized.
“The current Congress hasn’t exactly been a place where a whole lot has gotten done,” he said.
During last year’s budget process, Congress passed a series of month-long continuing resolutions to temporarily fund the government after reaching an impasse in April.
“There’s a pretty general assumption that a lot of the work of Congress is going to get done in a lame duck session [after the elections in November],” Fleming said.
“Those of us who do things like I do might be spending Christmas Eve on Capitol Hill,” he added jokingly.
Fleming said he will continue to work to increase the amount of funding allocated toward student aid programs.
“So much of this is so important to Georgetown students,” he said. “At a time when we are doing so much here to help low-income students … I don’t want to see anything stand in the way of our being able to do even more of that.”

The Georgetown Program Board has secured a headliner for the annual spring concert early this year to prevent the problems with last-minute rescheduling that hampered last year’s event.
Although concert planners have not yet released the name of the artist because contract details have not been finalized, they said the event will likely draw a larger crowd than it did last year.
Planning for the concert, which is scheduled for March 30 in McDonough Arena, began in November.
“We tried to get started a lot earlier this year, so we didn’t have to scramble like in years past,” GPBConcert Chair Will Henderson (MSB ’14) said.
Henderson did not release GPB’s annual concert budget, but said that additional donations from groups such as the Senior Class Committee and What’s After Dark have helped secure stronger performers than last year. The lineup for last spring’s concert included Kevin Rudolf, Shwayze andDev and the Cataracs. It is likely that seniors will receive a discount on their tickets this year because of the Senior Class Committee’s contribution.
GPB Executive Board Chair Tyler Simpson (COL ’13) said the responsibility of booking artists falls on the concert planning committee and an additional volunteer core of about a dozen students. These students act as representatives for the student body, suggesting artists that they think will be well received.
While the committee conducted a school-wide survey last spring in order to gauge student responses to certain artists, the current GPB board feels it was not a helpful tool in securing a performer and raising student interest in the concert.
“The survey didn’t help much, and it wasn’t realistic,” Simpson said.
Henderson, who is in his first term as GPB concert chair, believes the annual spring concert will continue to improve in the future as donations from campus groups increase and planning is more efficiently executed.
“Hopefully in following years we can make serious changes to make the concert a bigger and better deal,” he said.
Correction: The article previously stated that the Georgetown Program Board’s annual concert budget is $13,000 and that Students of Georgetown, Inc. provided funds for artists. That budget number reflects additional funds given to GPB by the Georgetown University Student Association for the prospect of putting on a fall concert last semester. Also, The Corp has only donated refreshment in the past. The article has been updated to reflect these changes.

Donna Hernandez (SFS ’13) eloped with her husband, Eduardo Panyaguy, two weeks into her freshman year at Georgetown.
The couple, who met in high school, married beforePanyaguy, a U.S. Marine, was deployed to Afghanistan in the fall of 2009.
“We were planning on a long engagement until I realized that he was going to be part of the unit that was spearheading a lot of movement in Afghanistan. The unit he was replacing had a 40 percent casualty rate,” Hernandez said. “We looked at the options and said, ‘Let’s go ahead and do it.'”
Megan Kirby’s (COL ’12) decision to marry young also stemmed from her then-boyfriend’s commitment to the armed forces. James Kirby joined the U.S. Army two years into college and was stationed in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011.
If the couple had not married, Kirby would have been unable to receive official news about her husband from the military or take advantage of education benefits for military families.
“We were going to wait until after college, but with him joining the military, honestly it was more practical,” she said.
Once her husband was deployed, Kirby struggled to fill dual roles of wife and student.
“It was really difficult balancing being a student and being married to someone in the army. Especially with the time difference, I would want to stay up and talk with him, but I would have classes the next day,” she said.
Kirby said that people began to notice changes in her behavior while her husband was overseas.
“One of my professors noticed that I was tired and distracted, so she emailed my dean, and my dean met with me to talk about my special circumstance,” she said.
The attention of Kirby’s dean and professors ultimately allowed her more flexibility with class attendance.
“When I went home for [my husband’s] homecoming ceremony, my professors were kind about giving me time off for that. Overall, Georgetown has been very accommodating,” she said.
But according to Hernandez, the university could do more for married students.
“I’ve never seen anything on campus that’s focused on the married undergrad. I feel like there is much more that could be done, especially with the Jesuits and other leaders on campus,” Hernandez said.
In addition to balancing academia with married life, students said they often have to jump through hoops to secure resources like financial aid because they are no longer considered dependents of their parents.
“It was so odd, because most people don’t have to think, ‘Before I get married, let me talk to my financial aid advisor,'” Hernandez said.
Married students also face unique roadblocks in securing campus housing, because the university’s Code of Student Conduct prohibits cohabitation.
“[Georgetown housing] is hesitant to provide married students housing because they don’t want to provide de facto housing for your spouse as well,” Hernandez said.
For both women, perhaps the biggest challenge of their relationships is balancing their identities as college students with their responsibilities as spouses.
“It’s like you’re stuck in this limbo, middle place,” Kirby said. Hernandez agreed.
“The biggest challenge is really trying to live the college lifestyle,” she said.
“Especially being a female, guys try to tip-toe around me. But I’m just a regular person. I don’t have cooties. I’m the same as everyone else, just on a different path.”

As the end of his term on Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E approaches, Jake Sticka (COL ’13) is set to begin recruiting students to run for the two student seats on the commission up for a vote in November.
Recruited during the spring semester of his freshman year by the previous ANC student commissioner, Sticka has served as the commissioner for Single-Member District 2E04 for two years. He is currently on the transportation committee and is secretary of the commission, a role typically held by the ANC’s student representative.
ANC 2E’s redistricting plan, which passed in December, split the Georgetown area into eight single-member districts, allotting two SMDs to areas inhabited solely by Georgetown students. As a consequence, two students will likely be elected in the upcoming contest.
ANC student commissioners must attend monthly ANC meetings — as well as meetings throughout the city, vote on important issues and speak with constituents and campus media.
Because commissioners must live in the districts they represent, Sticka won’t know who is eligible to run until freshman housing selection ends in the first week of March.
“[After March] I’ll know where they are living, which is essential for me to go forward with the process because the two districts are split,” Sticka said.
Sticka plans to hold information sessions outlining what the job entails and how to run for the position. At these sessions, he hopes to gauge potential candidates’ level of interest and prepare them for the election process.
Sticka expressed concern about the District’s requirement that candidates collect 25 signatures from registered voting constituents in their specific SMD in order to appear on the November ballot.
“One thing that really is unfortunate is that the petition period … starts Aug. 3 and runs through Sept. 1, and there aren’t students on campus during that period,” Sticka said.
Freshmen usually run for the ANC position because the term lasts two years and the commissioner must live in his district during his entire time on the commission.
“If any sophomore should want to run, I’d be happy to support them in the process, but I suspect that there won’t be too many that will want to do that,” Sticka said.
Open to any interested and committed students, Sticka said that the ANC student commissioner position requires an open relationship with the Georgetown community, attention to student concerns and the ability to impart these concerns to the ANC.
“As a personal voter, I definitely will be looking for people that know how to be in touch with students,” he said.
In addition to representing university interests, any student commissioner would have to hold his own against the ANC’s six other commissioners representing SMDs in Burleith, Georgetown and Hillandale.
Though the ANC has become a battleground for debate about Georgetown’s 2010 Campus Plan during Sticka’s term, his relationship with his fellow commissioners has been civil.
“We are very respectful of each other even when we have differences of opinion,” Sticka said.
ANC 2E chair Ron Lewis added that despite the tensions, he has always enjoyed a sound working relationship with student commissioners.
“[The student commissioners have been] engaged in community affairs, smart, interested and interesting folks, and I really like that. The one wrinkle this year has of course been the Campus Plan, and I wish that the Campus Plan would just go away because … emotions run high and people take positions they have to take and that’s not easy,” Lewis said.
He added that he is confident that Sticka’s recruitment efforts will yield strong candidates.
“I think the system is pretty good at coming up with the right quality of candidates,” Lewis said. “I have no doubt that two great people will come through this election.”
