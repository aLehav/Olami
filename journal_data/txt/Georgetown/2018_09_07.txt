Student groups such as H*yas for Choice and Students of Georgetown, Inc.,  commonly known as The Corp, and dozens of individuals demanded the university publicly address the current lack of a full-time dedicated Title IX coordinator in a letter addressed to university administration circulated this week. 
Samantha Berner currently serves as both the Title IX investigator and the interim Title IX coordinator, a role she filled after the first full-time Title IX Coordinator Laura Cutway left her role, unannounced to students, in late June. 
A nationwide search for a new Title IX coordinator began in July, and finalists for the position are visiting campus in upcoming weeks, according to a university spokesperson. 
Daria Crawford (COL ’20), Avery Moje (COL ’19), Kory Stuer (COL ’19), Andy Turner (SFS ’20) and Susu Zhao (COL ’19), authored the letter, which urges the university to fill the vacant coordinator position by Nov. 1 and to update the student body on its progress on the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Task Force 2017 recommendations, which includes long term and short term approaches to prevent sexual assault on campus. 
The letter also asks the university to provide a public response to the letter by Sept. 14. 
The letter, addressed to Vice President for Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action Rosemary Kilkenny, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Assistant Vice President for Student Health Vince WinklerPrins, was posted on Facebook and emailed to administrators Aug. 31. 
“While we appreciate Ms. Berner’s dedication to the community, making one person do two demanding jobs is not only unfair to her but also to the students who have a legal right to a full and functioning Title IX office,” the letter reads.
Cutway was named the university’s first full-time Title IX coordinator Jan. 11, 2016, to enforce the university’s sexual misconduct policy, investigate sexual misconduct and lead the school’s sexual misconduct education efforts.
The authors outlined three demands in the letter, all aimed at increasing transparency about the currently vacant Title IX position.    
“We don’t need to know this information. The community needs to know this information,” Stuer said in an interview with The Hoya.  
In response to the letter, administrators are meeting with the authors in the coming weeks to discuss their demands, and potential future steps. 
Kilkenny noted that Title IX compliance does not require an employee to be dedicated to the role of investigator nor coordinator. 
“While many institutions meet the federal requirement by making Title IX compliance one of several issues in a staff member’s portfolio, Georgetown had demonstrated its commitment to this position by hiring its first full-time Title IX Coordinator in 2016,” Kilkenny said in a statement to The Hoya. “We’ve also taken the extra step of hiring a separate full-time Title IX investigator.”
The letter was written after the authors learned about Cutway’s departure through word of mouth. 
H*yas for Choice reposted the letter Aug. 31, and The Corp did the same Sept. 5. 
“We shared the letter to call attention to the understaffing of the office and hope that the university will take the necessary steps to ensure its functionality,” The Corp wrote in a statement to The Hoya. 
Those who shared the letter emphasized their primary concern was the lack of transparency regarding the position. 
“As an organization that promotes safe and healthy sex between consenting adults, we are concerned by the lack of a functioning Title IX office with a full-time Title IX Coordinator to ensure a safe environment and protections for sexual assault survivors on campus,” Elianna Schiffrick (SFS ’21), communications co-chair for H*yas for Choice, wrote in an email on behalf of the organization. “Further, we are dismayed by the lack of transparency displayed by the University regarding an issue that so directly concerns and affects the student body.” 
For Turner, hiring a full-time Title IX coordinator is crucial especially now, as over 50 percent of college sexual assaults occur between August and November, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN). 
The likely high volume of instances of sexual misconduct could make adequately addressing cases brought to the Office of Title IX Compliance more difficult, Turner said.
“We’re now in the period known as “the red zone,” which is the time about 50 percent of sexual assaults occur — between August and November,” Turner said. In the coming months, “there will be more reports coming in, and we just don’t believe that one person can adequately function in those two jobs.”
The circulated letter comes after the New York Times reported that Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, plans to release Title IX guidelines that would narrow the definition of sexual harassment, expand the rights of those accused of sexual misconduct and limit institutional liability.  
The Georgetown University Student Association published a separate letter Sept. 4 to address the anticipated Title IX guideline updates. 
“We, the undersigned, urge Georgetown University President John DeGioia and University administrators to recommit to their statement released last September in response to the interim guidance and clarify to the student body any specific steps the University will take in response to any new guidance,” according to the letter.
Grace Perret (COL ‘20), GUSA sexual assault and student safety policy chair, noted the current political context makes holding campus leaders accountable even more relevant today. 
“We need all of Georgetown’s sexual assault prevention services functioning at their best capacity because these changes make survivors even more vulnerable and less likely to use those services than they already were,” Perret wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Kilkenny and other administrators will be meeting with the authors of the letter to discuss next steps, she said.  
“We have received this letter and are in contact with the students to arrange a meeting, update them on our progress and discuss our shared commitment to addressing sexual misconduct,” Kilkenny said in a statement. “Combatting sexual misconduct requires robust collaboration throughout our community and we are encouraged to see continued engagement from students.”

September 7, 2018 by Erin Doherty and Christian Paz 5 Comments 
The undergraduate board of the Georgetown University chapter of Delta Phi Epsilon Professional Foreign Service Fraternity resigned Saturday and suspended all official chapter activities, including recruitment, in protest of the fraternity’s national general secretary, Terrence Boyle (SFS ’63, LAW ’72), who is accused of sexism and bigotry.
Boyle has since appointed four new, non-Georgetown undergraduates to lead the fraternity’s Georgetown chapter, though the board members’ identities have been withheld by Boyle.
In an email signed by the undergraduate board of the fraternity and sent to all Georgetown brothers Saturday afternoon, the board members announced their decision to step down.
“As a board, we have been disrespected by Terrence Boyle and feel incapable of making the necessary changes,” the email read. “Thus, the undergraduate board of Alpha Chapter Delta Phi Epsilon Professional Foreign Service Fraternity is resigning effective immediately.”
But since the resignation, Boyle has announced that a new leadership will lead the organization in secret. In two separate emails obtained by The Hoya, Boyle has blamed a “trolling environment” and “malicious lies” as the reason he is withholding the names of the new board.
Current and former members of the fraternity have confirmed to The Hoya that these identities have not been disclosed to the fraternity’s membership, and DPE chapters at The George Washington University, American University and James Madison University have told The Hoya they will not recognize the Georgetown chapter’s new leadership.
Boyle also wrote he will not make public the names of dues-paying members of the fraternity.
“Right now, though, the problem is that all the undergrad brothers are very much worried that, if they should step up and become chapter officers, they will then, likely in this climate, be personally targeted in The Hoya,” Boyle wrote in an email obtained by The Hoya.
Boyle said he considers The Hoya’s coverage as a reason the names are withheld.
“Because the Hoya and others have been spreading malicious untrue stories about DPE members as part of a trolling, the new officers, for the time being, choose not to be publicized,” Boyle wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The resignation of the undergraduate board left the chapter in an unprecedented situation, though the chapter being led by non-Georgetown students is not new, Boyle wrote in the email obtained by The Hoya.
“This unprecedented situation of there being an Alpha Chapter but without its having any officers could not continue,” Boyle wrote. “There is, [in other] words, nothing unprecedented in the Chapter’s now having non-GU undergrads as its officers.”
Boyle, in his 40th year as national general secretary of DPE, joined the fraternity as an undergraduate. The professional foreign service fraternity, which began at Georgetown in 1920, is now composed of sorority and fraternity chapters on college campuses around the country.
Kevin Lim (MSB ’19), the now-former president of DPE’s Alpha Chapter, said the board’s resignation was collective action against Boyle.
“Our resignation statement is what we stand for,” Lim wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Boyle said he was disappointed by the resignations and called the allegations “baseless.”
“I and the huge majority of both new and old members of Delta Phi Epsilon stand fast to the noble purposes of the fraternity and its continued historic commitment to being a very open and inclusive organization,” Boyle wrote Saturday in an email to The Hoya.
Allegations of sexism and bigotry against Boyle surfaced this summer, after an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education published in July reported that Boyle wrote a post in the unofficial DPE Facebook page that the organization should be “a fraternity. All men. Not some kind of frasorority.”
The Chronicle’s report has been independently verified and confirmed by The Hoya. Boyle’s June 30 Facebook post came shortly before the organization convened in Washington, D.C., for its biennial convention, the same event where Boyle had been re-elected as general secretary for years before.
Boyle’s post allegedly was written in opposition of other national-board candidates who “are set on a platform for installing chapters outside the US and set not only on allowing women to be initiated into DPE Fraternity but in allowing them to have seats on its national board and votes at its conventions.”
Currently, no female members of Delta Phi Epsilon sororities have representation at the national level, while co-ed fraternities have misled Boyle on their membership to not lose voting rights, according to Andrew Lama (GWU ’19), president of The George Washington University’s DPE chapter. No woman has a vote at the DPE national conventions, according to DPE fraternity bylaws.
The same Chronicle article reported that in 2013, female DPE members from the George Washington chapter were required to spend part of the evening cleaning at the annual Christmas party hosted in the Georgetown University chapter house if they wanted to bring a male date to the party.
Boyle’s Facebook post and the reports in the article published by the Chronicle sparked discussion among DPE chapters across the country of their distrust for Boyle serving as the general secretary, according to Facebook posts viewed by The Hoya.
Leadership of non-Georgetown chapters launched a petition July 18 signed by DPE alumni, including over 50 individuals from Georgetown, demanding that Boyle be immediately removed from his position as general secretary.
“Notwithstanding any bylaw reforms or changes in the DPE governance structure, we demand that Mr. Boyle be immediately removed from his leadership position, that there be a thorough investigation into his conduct, and that the National Leadership immediately apologize to the affected parties for his statements and practices,” the petition reads.
In an op-ed published by The Hoya on Aug. 29, DPE leaders at George Washington, James Madison University and American University urged individuals at Georgetown to take a stand against the fraternity, calling the activities of DPE’s board and the Georgetown fraternity misaligned with the founding mission of DPE.
“Incoming freshmen should not join Delta Phi Epsilon, and university administrators must address the chapter’s corruptive influence on the campus community,” the op-ed reads. “We strongly discourage Georgetown students from engaging with the fraternity until its leaders pursue sweeping reform in organizational governance and culture.”
Boyle condemned The Hoya’s op-ed and earlier reporting on the Georgetown board’s resignation in an email obtained by The Hoya.
Meanwhile, the Georgetown chapter of DPE Professional Foreign Service Sorority condemned Boyle in a Facebook post Aug. 30.
“The Sorority has always functioned independently of the Fraternity and Mr. Boyle,” the statement read. “We have worked at length to address the issues of mistreatment of individuals by Mr. Boyle. We no longer participate in any fraternity events and have very minimal interactions with the DPE brothers and Mr. Boyle.”
This post has been updated to reflect developments within the DPE fraternity.

I am a brother of the aforementioned alien chapter (the chapter that exists outside of the US) and we have spent a long time in discourse with Mr. Boyle in an attempt to touch base with the national leadership of the fraternity. We haven’t been met with very positive and constructive responses from Mr. Boyle. Especially when we were told that our constitution could not allow females to join, even if operating under their own chapter bylaws .

The HOYA should in its articles at least try
to get simple facts right.
Despite The HOYA’s saying otherwise,
I did not “appoint” anyone to be a chapter officer.
The four new officers of Alpha Chapter
were elected by loyal chapter members
who are disgusted by the mass resignations
of their predecessors due to Lama’s pressure.
And despite The HOYA’s saying otherwise,
there are no sorority chapters nor co-ed chapters
within Delta Phi Epsilon Foreign Service Fraternity.
Our Fraternity, as its very name ought to tell anyone,
has only men as members.  Always has, always will.
For sure, there are indeed sorority and co-ed chapters
within Delta Phi Epsilon,
but they are not within the Fraternity,
but are instead within the over-all, co-ed
Delta Phi Epsilon Society, our wing comprising
both men and women. 
And, for sure, there are indeed people who want
the Fraternity, as well as the Society, to be co-ed.
That’s an interesting debate.  One that The HOYA
just cannot seem to report accurately in its stories.
Which logically brings me to this perplexing standstill.
How, in its “reporting,” doesThe HOYA go
from claiming that Sisters within Delta Phi Epsilon
are upset over my (supposedly) having made just Sisters
do housework before our Christmas Parties
to then claiming that I have long prevented women
from joining Delta Phi Epsilon?
Which is it?
Are the complaining Sisters in Delta Phi Epsilon
or are they not in?
If they are in,
then where does The HOYA come off saying
that I have been preventing them from getting in?
If they are not in,
then where does The HOYA come off saying
that Sisters within DPE are complaining
that I required them, only them,
to do housework?

You seem to be focusing on the technicalities of a club rather than your treatment of women in and around the club. Call them in, out, or purple, still isn’t the reason for the board’s resignation. Seems like you need to let go.

The Blue and Gray Tour Guide Society will not hire freshmen this fall as part of a new recruitment policy designed to ensure all tour guides have sufficient experience as a college student.
Blue and Gray confirmed to The Hoya that it will not accept students who have not yet finished a semester at college. The organization will continue to accept transfer students in their first semester at Georgetown.
The organization made the announcement on its Facebook page on Sept. 1, seven days before the Club and Activities Fair, where freshmen are given the opportunity to learn about student organizations on campus.
“We ask that [freshmen] take one semester to gain further personal experiences at Georgetown to help draw from when speaking to perspective students and families,” the group’s post said.
Blue and Gray is one of several highly selective clubs, along with Students of Georgetown, Inc., commonly known as The Corp, and Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union, that has come under fire for exclusivity and lack of diversity over the past five years. Annually one of the most competitive clubs on campus in terms of admission, Blue and Gray recorded a 10.2 percent acceptance rate in the fall of 2016.
Last year, Blue and Gray took steps toward improving their organizational diversity, altering its application questions in January 2017. Leaders of the organization were also part of an informal working group on club exclusivity with members of other student groups including The Corp, GUASFCU and the Georgetown University Student Association. The working group hosted a public forum in December 2017 to address club culture at Georgetown.
Blue and Gray declined to release the acceptance rate and demographics of the applicant pool last fall as part of an ongoing effort to combat club exclusivity. The Hoya has previously requested admissions information from Blue and Gray in 2017 and 2018.
Freshmen comprised around 25 percent of the admitted tour guides during the fall admissions cycles of 2016 and 2017, hiring nine freshmen in a class of 32 tour guides in the fall of 2016 and seven freshmen in a class of 29 in the fall of 2017.
Despite the change in policy, Blue and Gray recruitment coordinator Aidan Fallon (SFS ’19) said the decision to refrain from hiring freshmen this fall will not considerably affect the selection process for other applicants.
“As in past years, Blue & Gray will consider all applicants equally, regardless of factors such as class year. We believe that this will allow all applicants to speak from personal experience during the interview, which will help them to deliver a clear and coherent statement,” Fallon wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In addition to giving time for freshmen to gain experience for their interviews, this change will also benefit them and the university by allowing students time to gain familiarity with the campus before giving tours, Fallon wrote.
“While previous freshman fall hires have been wonderful, we believe that this policy will allow all applicants the ability to speak from personal experience when interacting with prospective students and their families, helping to deliver the best visit possible to the diverse populations our campus welcomes every year,” Fallon wrote.
Elizabeth Hyman (COL ’21), a Blue and Gray tour guide hired during her fall semester freshman year, said she enjoyed her first semester, but also said she could have benefitted from waiting a semester before applying.
“Being hired freshman fall was exciting and a great way to meet people right off the bat, but I don’t think I completely realized all the time I was going to have to commit to blue and gray,” Hyman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Having a semester to learn more about the program and the school would have been beneficial.”
Blue and Gray started considering the policy change in April, and spent time deliberating with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions before making the decision Sept. 1, Fallon said.
“In consultation with the Executive Board and the Admissions office, we discussed different rationales for implementing this decision,” Fallon wrote. “These considerations include the ability of applicants to speak from personal experience on tours, allowing freshmen students a full semester to transition to college before diving into the application process, and the comfortability of applicants in navigating the campus prior to leading tours.”
Multiple students, though expressing their disappointment, said they acknowledge the validity of Blue and Gray’s concerns. Emilia Game (SFS ’22) said though she was disappointed to find out she could not apply this fall, she accepted the rationale for the policy.
“As disappointing as it is not to have the option to apply for Blue and Grays as a freshman, I do understand that we will not be able to offer as much as older students when it comes to being a Tour Guide,” Game wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Isabelle Wisco (MSB ’22) said she did not feel she would be comfortable giving tours yet.
“Seeing that I’ve only been here for a couple weeks, I do not feel equipped to present the school to a group of prospective students and parents. For those who have family history with university, it may be different, but given my lack of experience, I understand Blue and Gray’s decision,” Wisco wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Student-made artwork honoring the lives of the 272 slaves sold by Georgetown in 1838 were hung in Red Square on Tuesday morning. The art installation, which, weather permitting, will be taken down on Friday, was created as part of the GU272 campaign that began in 2015.
Mélisande Short-Colomb (COL ’21), a descendant of one of the 272 slaves sold, helped organize the installation. Short-Colomb said that the installation was aimed at sparking conversation about the GU272 slaves and continuing to educate new and returning students about the GU272.
“If the university doesn’t actively include the history of the university, the GU272, their slaveholding, human trafficking practices, incoming generations of students will not know,” she said. “The students that were involved in the action in 2015, many of them have already graduated or they are moving out.”
The display includes maps created by Amalia Stahl (COL ‘21), portraits by Maya Archer (SFS ’21) and Eliza Phillips (COL ’21) and an abstract piece painted by Tristan MacHale (COL ’19).
Stahl said that she hopes that her piece educates community members who have limited knowledge about the GU272 slaves.
Maya Archer (SFS ’21) painted a faceless portrait for the installation as a focus on the men, women and children involved in the trade. Archer was frustrated by the lack of student activism and information surrounding the 1838 sale.
“It made me … frustrated that a I could only find three pictures of this whole legacy we have at this school, and that something as small as an art show is the biggest thing we’ve done in the past two years besides a small little book that’s been brought out by a couple faculty and a couple students,” Archer said.
MacHale said that his abstract piece was meant to highlight the lack of publicity that the university gave to the 1838 sale prior to the GU272 campaign.
“The main idea was to have something blurred in the background coming into focus in the foreground, like Georgetown — I don’t know if it was intentional, but they just like let it be hid under the rug,” MacHale said. “I’m not sure who found it, but some people found the documents and just started like digging in and like bringing it to focus,” MacHale said.
Phillips made Short-Colomb the subject of her portrait and included quotes from Short-Colomb to draw attention to the experience of the descendants and their voices. Phillips said that she hoped her piece would remind members of the community to listen to the descendants when discussing the sale and the reparations to make.
“The main message I want to send to the Georgetown community, and especially the university itself, is how when they’re trying to, when they’re having conversations about reparations and reparative action that they should make sure the descendants remain heavily involved in these conversations,” Phillips said.
Phillips is a member of The Hoya and traveled to Maringouin, La. in June on The Hoya’s reporting trip to learn about the descendants of the GU272.
The artists and Short-Colomb spoke of the necessity of campaigns such as the art installation to increase awareness and conversation about the GU272 campaign and Georgetown’s history with slavery. Archer said that she hoped that this campaign sparks dialogue about Georgetown’s history.
“I just hope it starts a conversation at least because it’s something that we like gloss over,” Archer said. “We talked about it like I said last year, and maybe this would have influenced my decision of coming to Georgetown if I had actually thought about this more.”
Stahl said she thought that if the broader Georgetown community is made aware of the history surrounding the GU272, students would be able to have a greater influence on how the community addresses it.
“It’s a part of Georgetown’s identity, for better or for worse,” Stahl said. “And I think it’s very important that it’s coming to light now, even though it’s very late, and I think that more students should be aware of what happened and that might shift just the way we treat people in general and the whole idea of reparations or no reparations.”
Events like the art installation are crucial to spreading awareness and understanding about the university’s past, Short-Colomb said.
“Everybody worked really hard to get here and you hear all the time around the campus, you get these high fives and these praises for doing a job really well. You got here, you made it. There’s so many people who never got that high five,” Short-Colomb said. “Two hundred and seventy-two people who were disposable to the people who say they care about you. So, I think I would like to send a message to all young people entering this school, any school, to dig a little bit deeper. Don’t trust everything you hear.”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Tristan MacHale as Travis MacHale

The National Museum of African American History and Culture’s launch of its trial weekday, no-pass entry program attracted over 7,000 visitors on the first day of the monthlong program.
Dubbed “Walk-Up Weekdays,” the museum’s program waives the requirement for timed-entry passes to be obtained in advance on weekdays in the month of September.
On the first day of the program’s implementation, hundreds of visitors were lined up at the doors when the museum opened at 10 a.m. Some arrived as early as 8 a.m., according to The Washington Post.
The museum received more visitors this week following the launch of the no-pass program, NMAAHC Manager of Media Relations Fleur Paysour said.
“We’re seeing a great number of people come in,” Paysour said in an interview with The Hoya. “That has us believe that people feel much more comfortable about coming to the museum instead of going online to reserve passes.”
When the museum first opened Sept. 24, 2016, admission required timed-entry passes, which had to be reserved online months in advance to prevent long lines and to control gallery crowds. Devoted to the recognition and appreciation of African American history and culture, the museum has seen over 4.5 million visitors since it opened, and over 1 million visitors in 2018 so far.
The museum first tested a no-pass entry system earlier this year, when it allowed pass-free entry every Wednesday in April and May. The resulting increase in visitors and positive public reaction spurred the museum to create “Walk-Up Weekdays,” another move to eventually transition away from timed-entry passes, according to The Washington Post.
Museum officials hoped that waiving the requirement for timed-entry passes would encourage more people to visit the museum, while also maintaining a comfortable viewing experience for guests.
“We undertook this experiment to see if this would make a difference and make it easier for people to experience the museum,” Paysour said.
The “Walk-Up Weekdays” program allows students an opportunity to explore the city, Megan Gaffney (SFS ’21) said.
“I think the change is important because it’s something that everyone should be able to see,” Gaffney said. “It’s an important part of our history that we need to recognize, especially when there are so many debates going on about the role of race and racism in America.”
Currently on display is the special exhibit “Watching Oprah,” which explores Oprah Winfrey’s life, career and influence on American culture.
The museum’s new trial program will encourage more visitors to learn about a crucial part of American history, Maya Archer (SFS ’21) said.
“I really hope that this allows more people to go see the museum,” Archer said. “The museum is important because it’s a part of American history that we sometimes like to put in the corner and ignore because sometimes it’s uncomfortable, and even though it is uncomfortable, it’s my history, and how my story came to be.”

The opening of Healy Family Student Center in 2014 brought not only new study spaces to Georgetown students, but also a new watering hole — Bulldog Tavern. Since it opened in November 2014, the tavern has changed management three times.
This fall, Epicurean and Company was selected as the new vendor for Bulldog Tavern. Previously, Aramark, the vendor that also supplies O’Donovan Hall, took over management from Bon Appetit Management Co. in May 2017.
According to Joelle Wiese, associate vice president for auxiliary services, this most recent switch in management was the result of a changing dining landscape on campus and university efforts to match student needs.
“As part of our continued efforts to respond to changing campus needs and improve dining program service and options the university conducted a competitive process to select new management of Bulldog Tavern for the 2018-19 academic year,” Wiese wrote in an email to The Hoya. “With a location already on the northside of campus, Epicurean has demonstrated its success and popularity among the Georgetown community.”
Epicurean and Co., which has been a part of Georgetown for 10 years, sees Bulldog Tavern as an opportunity to try new things.
“A pub is a pretty different concept from what we do at Epicurean now and it gives us an opportunity to implement a menu with items that we wouldn’t be able to necessarily fit with any of the sections here,” Epicurean and Co. general manager Michael Chon wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We would also be closer to another section of campus where we would interact more closely with a different group of students and staff that might not be able to get to Epicurean conveniently.”
To differentiate itself from Epicurean’s existing fare, Bulldog Tavern will feature a new menu, a weekly trivia night and potential BBQ nights on the patio with an outdoor bar.
“We don’t want this to be Epicurean 2.0. Rather, we want to build a new, successful restaurant that’s different from the other dining options on campus, as well as provide a casual setting to hang out,” Chon wrote. “We want to do a diverse menu with your typical bar staples (including Epi’s famous quesadillas, so people don’t have to walk across campus to get them) but also have plenty options for those with dietary restrictions, including vegans/vegetarians and those with food allergies.”
While the menu may not be the same as before, Chon said Epicurean is committed to making the dining experience at Bulldog Tavern as convenient as possible for students, despite no longer accepting meal exchanges.
“The new Bulldog will definitely accept flex and debit dollars. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to accept any meal exchanges because we’re not affiliated with Aramark. However, we’re hoping to provide a variety of affordable meal options in the to go window to offset this,” Chon wrote.
GUSA’s Dining Policy Chair Sina Nemazi (COL ’21) said he hopes the new Bulldog Tavern will eventually accept meal exchanges as it had in the past.
“I do want a meal exchange option there because I think that’s what people will miss about Bulldog,” Nemazi said. “Since Epi wanted to take on the risk of the space they should provide that option for the students.”
Epicurean and Co. is optimistic about the future of the restaurant under its new management.
“All in all, we recognize that the Bulldog Tavern has potential to be a great place for Georgetown students, staff, and guests. Originally, previous students from Georgetown voted for a pub on campus and that’s how the Bulldog Tavern came to existence,” Chon wrote. “This is a huge honor for us to be trusted with this space and we hope to do it justice.”
Bulldog Tavern aims to open for the new school year on the week of Sept. 10 with shorter hours and a limited menu. Eventually, Chon said, Bulldog Tavern’s normal operating hours will be 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., with plans to offer a breakfast option later in the year.

Bulldog should hire younger staff, like The Tombs, so students want to go. The service MUST get better. There’s no excuse for how bad the service is there. Bar tenders should be real bar tenders, not a random staff member put behind the bar. They should know how to make a drink; and the alcohol selection needs to be better. No Grey Goose? No Ketel One? No Tito’s? C’mon! Why will it close at 11p? One of the reasons for opening Bulldog in the first place was to have an option to keep students on campus. If it closes at 11p, that just gives students a place to pregame before they head into town. I mean, it’s never going to replace The Tombs, but it should be an alternative.

On a campus with multitude other daytime food options on campus surely it makes more sense to focus to filling the gap in the market and focuses on satisfying the evening and late-night crowd. It should either give up the pretence of being a bar or commit to this role wholeheartedly

Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia criticized Catholic leadership for its complicity in recently surfaced sexual assault scandals in an email on Tuesday. 
DeGioia’s email addressed a report published by a Pennsylvania grand jury in August that identified over 300 Catholic priests in Pennsylvania who sexually abused more than 1,000 children over seven decades, according to a Washington Post article.
One of the named perpetrators was Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, archbishop emeritus of Washington, D.C., who holds an honorary Georgetown degree. The Washington Post reported that McCarrick sexually abused both boys and men throughout his time as a Catholic priest. McCarrick was asked to be removed from public ministry in July, when his history of sexual abuse came to light, according to a statement released by the archbishop of New York.
In his email sent to the Georgetown community, DeGioia criticized the Catholic Church for the rampant scandals, but did not offer concrete actions that the university will take in response to McCarrick’s involvement in the sexual assault scandals.
“The discovery, in part through the efforts of the Attorney General and Grand Jury in Pennsylvania, of the depth and breadth of complicity over the last seventy years, has revealed an abject failure to protect the most vulnerable among us,” DeGioia wrote. “This systematic failure demands accountability on the part of the Church and discernment in our Georgetown community about our appropriate response.”
DeGioia indicated that university administration is pushing forward efforts to address the sexual assault scandals.
“We have begun, across the University, to lay the foundation for the dialogue, reflection, and action that will contribute to a deep and authentic transformation,” DeGioia wrote.
A university spokesperson specified that the administration will consider revoking McCarrick’s honorary degree.
“President DeGioia’s message to the community earlier this week shared that the University has initiated processes to address the deeply troubling revelations about Archbishop McCarrick and also in the Pennsylvania grand jury report,” he wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This includes an honorary degree review process.”
Several Catholic student groups on campus, including Catholic Women at Georgetown and the Knights of Columbus, have called for the administration to rescind McCarrick’s honorary degree, awarded in 2004, and they urged university administration to directly address the issue.
“I’m disappointed that the university has neglected to substantively address McCarrick’s misconduct,” Erica Lizza (SFS ’19), the president of Catholic Women at Georgetown said Aug. 8. “Our organization supports the revocation of McCarrick’s honorary Georgetown degree and hopes that the university will address the scandal and its impact with our larger D.C. Catholic community.” (Full disclosure: Lizza is a member of the editorial board at The Hoya.)
In his email, DeGioia quoted former Superior General of the Jesuits, Pedro Arrupe, S.J., in emphasizing the importance of maintaining the Jesuit value of fighting for social justice through education to ensure justice.
“We must help each other to … above all make sure that in the future the education imparted in Jesuit schools will be equal to the demands of justice in the world,” DeGioia wrote.
Georgetown’s programs in global development, health and social justice are efforts by the university to live up to this challenge articulated by Fr. Arrupe, according to DeGioia.
“Our programs in Global Health, Global Human Development, and our Center for Social Justice, Research, Teaching & Service are three examples of our efforts to respond to this challenge,” he wrote.
DeGioia called on the Georgetown community to maintain its commitment to social justice and change and to remember the university’s founding elements.   
“We respond best to the forces of disruption by deepening our commitment to our work,” he wrote. “We must accept the responsibility for which we are prepared and capable: to embrace the work of integrating the four elements of our identity in the service of social transformation.”
DeGioia expressed concern and a need to protect those affected by the scandal and asserted the need for better protection for those at risk of abuse. 
 “The most vulnerable among us must be protected,” DeGioia wrote. “They deserve the very best work we are capable of providing.  We have an immediate and urgent need to engage in the work of ‘cultural change’—to create a context in which the most vulnerable among us will be safe and protected, to create a context in which the abuse of power can be identified and eliminated.”

This is very important news and I’m glad someone like Meena Morar is covering it. McCarrick’s honorary Georgetown degree should be revoked.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded a $2 million grant to Georgetown researchers to continue HIV surveillance and to develop a secure data-sharing tool for public health agencies across the country.
The grant, which will provide funding for five years, will help researchers further develop the privacy-centered framework that avoids permanent storage of individual data and eliminate duplicate counts of cases in the National HIV Surveillance System. The grant period for the university began Jan. 1, 2018, and will continue through Dec. 31, 2022.
The strength of the research will be due to the expertise of professionals in multiple disciplines, including computer science, medicine and public health, according to Joanne Michelle Ocampo, project director in public health informatics for the Office of the Senior Vice President for Research and Georgetown’s Medical Center.
“This project is the direct result of years building collaborative public-private partnerships across public health agencies and academia and greatly illustrates how fruitful this type of interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral work can be,” Ocampo said in a April 23 news release.
The CDC’s National HIV Surveillance System is the primary arrangement for monitoring HIV cases in the United States, according to the CDC’s website. The CDC funds and assists state and local health departments with collecting the data.
Dr. Seble Kassaye, associate professor in Georgetown’s School of Medicine and co-principal investigator on the project, said the technology will help both those with the disease and also those trying to stop its spread.
“Implementing this technology in the public health sphere will allow agencies and departments to have updated, comprehensive and accurate information regarding progress toward our national HIV treatment goals to achieve high levels of viral suppression,” Kassaye said in the news release. “This is both for the benefit of the individual as well as to mitigate ongoing transmission of HIV.”
Currently, health departments and agencies report anonymous HIV data to the CDC so nationwide information can be analyzed to determine who is affected by the disease, and why. The goal of the research is to continue monitoring instances of HIV in the United States, while carefully maintaining the privacy of the individuals who have contracted the disease.
The Surveillance System has been collecting data since 1981, the same year the AIDS epidemic was first officially reported by the CDC, according to HIV.gov.
The HIV and AIDS surveillance activities typically consist of four major sources: hospitals, physicians, public and private clinics and medical records systems such as death certificates, according to an affiliate website of the CDC. Using a standard confidential case report, health departments collect information and transmit it to CDC electronically, omitting personally identifying information.
The research conducted using the grant will take a “socio-technical approach,” according to a university news release. This approach provides significant privacy protections to the data submitted. Users cannot access the system while data is being processed and the system only analyzes data while it is isolated in computer memory. Researchers hope that these unconventional approaches will help protect privacy while taking advantage of nationwide HIV statistics.
“This award is an important contribution toward fighting the HIV epidemic and further strengthens Georgetown’s leadership in privacy-preserving, big-data analytics,” Spiros Dimolitsas, senior vice president of research, said in a news release.

Lt. Charles Rathell, who served as an officer in the Georgetown University Police Department for seven years, died earlier this week from complications from an ongoing illness.
Rathell, 43, most recently worked as the Support Services Bureau commander, managing administrative tasks such as hiring, training, vehicle fleet maintenance, upkeep of uniforms and equipment, communication and IT. He died at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, Colo., according to GUPD Police Chief Jay Gruber.
Gruber said Rathell brought positivity and passion to the Georgetown police department.
“He brought a real passion for training and helped revitalize our field training program, our in-service training,” Gruber said in an interview with The Hoya. “I’ve only known him six years. I got here six years ago, but you know, he was an integral part of making GUPD what it is.”
Rathell introduced new training techniques and technologies that helped match GUPD’s abilities with those of surrounding police forces, specifically by implementing scenario-based training that enabled trainees to practice skills they learned in the classroom through recreations of potential real-life scenarios, according to Gruber.
“He brought a real professionalism to how our officers are trained, the way they were trained, professionalizing the whole approach to lesson plans and how instructors teach and organization around all of that,” Gruber said.
Rathell, who was born in Washington, D.C., dedicated much of his life to public service, after first becoming involved in law enforcement at the age of 18, according to Gruber. In addition to his role in GUPD, Rathell volunteered for a local fire department, the Bel Alton Volunteer Fire Department and EMS.
Gruber emphasized Rathell’s love for his work and the energy and passion that he invested in GUPD.
“He really had a passion for law enforcement,” Gruber said. “Anything that he could do to help professionalize or modernize our department, he was just all in.”
Rathell is survived by his wife, Stacey; his two children, Charles and Corda; and his mother, Janice. Gruber said that Rathell prioritized spending time with his family.
“He has two small children that he adored and loved spending time with. In fact, he would bring his son here occasionally if his son didn’t have school to visit the police station, and you just saw the love he had for his son,” Gruber said.
A dedicated family man, passionate law enforcement officer and avid Washington Redksins and Baltimore Ravens fan, Rathell was an integral part of his community, Gruber said.
“I liked nothing more than sitting in his office, just talking about the department, the university, the world, and he’s just a good guy to be with,” Gruber said. “He will be very sorely missed.”
Rathell’s funeral is set for Sept. 12 at a funeral home in Pennsylvania. His family has asked that those wishing to show their condolences donate to a charity of their chose in Rathell’s name instead of bringing flowers to the ceremony.

Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) will explore solutions to address the high rates of maternal mortality experienced by people of color across the nation at the first Maternal and Infant Health Summit on Sep. 12.
The goal of the summit is to push a broad range of objectives, including guaranteeing high-quality care during a mother’s first trimester of pregnancy, equipping healthcare facilities with the ability to manage the social needs of female patients and providing resources to new families, according to an Aug. 29 news release from the Office of the Mayor.
Bowser will be joined by at least six other mayors from cities across the country to host the free event, according to the news release.
In D.C., mothers of color experience disproportionally high rates of infant mortality in comparison to white women. According to the D.C. Department of Health’s “Perinatal Health and Infant Mortality Report” published in April 2018, the infant mortality rate for non-Hispanic, black mothers is 11.49 per 1,000 live births in comparison to 2.55 per 1,000 live births for non-Hispanic white mothers.
Bowser’s plan to expand women’s access to healthcare, has been central to her administration’s goal since her State of the District address in March 2018.
“I will also introduce legislation that will help ensure every pregnant woman in Washington, D.C. receives patient-centered, high-quality prenatal care and every newborn receives high-quality neonatal care,” she said at the State of the District.
The summit serves as an opportunity for politicians, health officials and policy advocates to collaborate to improve familial health, she said in the news release
“This summit is about addressing issues that affect mothers, babies, and families here in D.C. and across the entire nation – and talking about solutions,” Bowser said in the news release. “By working together, we can move closer to ensuring all women have access to high-quality health care before, during, and after child birth.”
The summit will feature mayors Lovely Warren from Rochester, N.Y., Karen Freeman-Wilson from Gary, Ind., Catherine Pugh from Baltimore, Md., Vi Lyles from Charlotte, N.C., Karen Weaver from Flint, Mich. and Toni Harp from New Haven, Conn.
Interacting with mayors from jurisdictions across the country affords the opportunity to establish a national agenda to resolve ongoing disparities, Warren said.
“We all benefit from hearing from other mayors and community leaders, learning from them, sharing what’s worked as we seek to improve the health of mothers and babies, and addressing the gap in outcomes for many minority mothers and babies in our communities,” Warren said in the Aug. 29 news release.
The summit will aim to educate D.C. residents in effectively managing different stages of pregnancy in addition to allowing women to become advocates of their own well-being, Bowser said in the Aug. 29 news release.
The summit will be held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center.
“We are working every day to ensure that all women have equal access to high-quality health care before, during, and after child birth—regardless of background, zip code, or income,” Bowser said. “This summit will complement the work my Administration is doing across all eight wards to provide women and children with the care they need to live healthy, happy lives.”

The survival of the global economy and the future health of the environment depend on manufacturing multi-use goods that produce less waste, argued architect and sustainable development leader Bill McDonough in an event Wednesday.
The event, entitled “Rethinking Plastic: Answering a Global Call to Action,” was cosponsored by Georgetown University’s Office of Sustainability, the Urban and Regional Planning Program, the Global Cities Initiative, the Mid-Atlantic Center for Children’s Health and the Environment,  and the Georgetown Environment Initiative and took place in Copley Formal Lounge on Wednesday afternoon.
McDonough works as an architect, but is renowned for his leadership in the global sustainability movement, according to Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia. He founded Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute, which strives to initiate “a new industrial revolution” with a sustainable focus.
McDonough received a Presidential Award for Sustainable Development in 1996 and Time Magazine named him “Hero for the Planet” in 1999. In 2014, he was appointed as the Inaugural Chair of the World Economic Forum’s Meta-Council on the Circular Economy.
DeGioia introduced McDonough for his keynote, after which McDonough discussed the impact of sustainability efforts at Georgetown with Carrie Bonfield (COL ’19), the president of Georgetown’s chapter of the Sustainable Ocean Alliance, a national student organization that promotes the health of the world’s oceans. Also involved in the discussion was Dr. Timothy Warren, the chair of the Chemistry Department and co-chair of Georgetown’s Environment Initiative, an organization dedicated to the study of the environment in relation to society, scientific understanding and policy.
McDonough’s work focuses on fighting what he calls “throwaway” culture, the idea that products are good for one-time use and should then be discarded.
“Throwaway culture assumes there’s an ‘away,’” McDonough said.
McDonough proposed a new way to create susainable goods by designing reusable products.
“If I design for end of use, I can design for next use,” he said. “Essentially, we want to go from a linear economy of taking and making waste, to a circular economy of retake, remake and regenerate.”
McDonough said that manufacturers must focus on the future environmental impact of their products beyond initial use in order to cultivate a more sustainable economy.
“Would you actually go out and design a system that puts 18 billion pounds of plastic in the oceans every year?” McDonough said. “Nature doesn’t have a design problem. Humans do.”
Because the issue of environmental health is visible in the form of litter and pollution, it will resonate with the public and encourage them to support and engage with sustainability efforts, McDonough said.
Warren echoed McDonough’s call to action and encouraged Georgetown students and faculty to incorporate sustainability into their individual research.
“In all the intellectual curiosity that we have, there are ways that we can look at a problem that we’ve been working on, as students for weeks or as faculty for years or decades, and try to see what connection that has to the environment, what connection that has to sustainability,” Warren said.
Bonfield offered examples of how to build a sustainable lifestyle at Georgetown, describing how she carries reusable cutlery and a travel mug with her to reduce her carbon footprint, and encouraged other Georgetown students to do the same.
“Think about your actions and how they impact the rest of the environment around you and try to be a champion for the environment and set a culture of eco-living wherever you go,” she said.
McDonough emphasized the magnitude of the problems facing our environment and the need for long-term commitment to solve them.
“It will take us all, it will take forever, but that’s the point,” McDonough said.
