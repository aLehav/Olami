A law student was robbed and assaulted while walking on the Law Center campus Monday night, according to an alert sent out to Law Center faculty and students by the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Management there.
The student was walking on Massachusetts Avenue and 2nd Street at around 9:20 p.m. when a man forcibly removed her umbrella and ripped it apart. The suspect then struck her in the face with the umbrella. The alert did not specify what items were stolen from the victim during the robbery.
The suspect is described as a black man wearing a green baseball hat and a white shirt, about six feet tall. He was also carrying a drawstring backpack at the time.
According to Sgt. David Ruiz, an investigator for the main campus Department of Public Safety, the alert was not sent out to faculty and staff on the main campus because the incident didn’t pose an immediate threat to those community members.
Representatives of the Law Center’s Department of Public Safety could not be reached for comment at press time.

Visiting assistant professor of sociology and prominent political analyst Mehrdad Mashayekhi died Wednesday, according to a department email sent to sociology majors, minors and faculty.
The university is organizing a memorial ceremony, Sociology Department Chair Tim Wickham-Crowley wrote in the message on Thursday. The date for the service has yet to be set.
Mashayekhi, who was born in Iran in 1953, had been teaching in the department of sociology and anthropology since 1989. He taught Introduction to Sociology, as well as classes that addressed the relationship among social movements, politics, culture and globalization. Mashayeki had also served on the faculty of George Mason University, The George Washington University and the University of Maryland. His research and publications focused on social movements, civil society, political culture and Islamic reform.
Masheyekhi had contributed regularly to Persian TV, Voice of America and BBC, commenting on Iranian politics and society. The professor had been struggling with pancreatic cancer for over a year, an illness reported in August by The Iranian, an online English language publication followed largely by North American Iranians.
“We can all learn a lesson or two from him — about the beauty and preciousness of life and how to persevere in the face of adversity,” the article said.
