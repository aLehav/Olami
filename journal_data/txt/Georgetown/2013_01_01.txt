Richard Sandoval Restaurants has bought local institution The Third Edition, according to blog Guest of a Guest.
The blog reports that the Wisconsin Avenue storefront will likely turn into a Mexican restaurant, as Sandoval operates Latin American cuisine eateries in the District as well as across the US and internationally.
Third Edition opened in 1969 and was featured in the 80’s movie St. Elmo’s Fire.
More recently, the nightclub and bar was temporarily shut down from December 29, 2011 to January 2, 2012 after selling alcohol to minors.
Before being sold, Third Edition was owned by Capital Restaurant Concepts, Ltd., the same company behind Georgetown restaurants J. Paul’s, Paolo’s and Old Glory.
