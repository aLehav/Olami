The Office of Undergraduate Admissions sent letters of acceptance to 2,345 high school seniors on Friday, selecting 18 percent of applicants to the Class of 2015.
The admission rate this year was slightly lower than last year’s regular cycle rate of 19.3 percent.
The acceptance rate for the College was 17 percent, the lowest among the four undergraduate schools, but application rates of the other schools were only slightly higher. Among applicants to the School of Foreign Service, 19.8 percent of applicants were admitted, compared to 19.4 percent for the School of Nursing and Health Studies and 19.2 percent for the McDonough School of Business.
Black students make up about 11 percent of admitted students. Twelve percent of admitted students are Latino and 16 percent are Asian-American. International students comprise about 10 percent of the admitted group.
While 3,468 applicants were accepted in the early and regular cycles combined, the target incoming class number is 1,580 students, according to Charles Deacon, dean of undergraduate admissions. There are currently 1,200 students on the waiting list.
The original version of this story stated that 3,648 students were accepted in the regular cycle. That is the total number of students accepted. The original version also stated that 19,275 applied during the regular cycle. That is the total number of applicants.

More students eyeing careers in business and nursing applied to Georgetown this year, with both the MSB and the NHS seeing sizable increases in the number of applicants to the class of 2015.
According to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon, applications to the McDonough School of Business fell after the 2008 recession but are now on the rise.
Applicants interested in pre-medical studies and the School of Nursing and Health Studies are also increasing because of the practical use of such degrees, he added.
Deacon said that students’ academic preferences are also sensitive to current events.
“It pretty much follows the world,” he said, citing a similar increase in interest in the School of Foreign Service after Sept. 11, 2001.
Despite these changes, admission to Georgetown remained typically competitive. Of 19,275 applicants, 3,468 students were accepted into the Class of 2015 in total.
Applicants to the College of Arts and Sciences faced a 17 percent acceptance rate, the lowest of the four undergraduate schools.
“The college is the most competitive because it’s the catch-all for the undecideds,” Deacon said.
Based on historical averages, Deacon expects around 46 percent of admitted students to decide to come to Georgetown.
This yield rate is “very statistically predictable,” Deacon said.
While the overall yield is generally high, yield from black students is expected to be slightly lower than the total rate. Last year, about 42 percent of accepted black students decided to come to Georgetown.
At least two students from every state were admitted, though the incoming class may not include students from all 50. Only two students from North Dakota and three students from South Dakota received acceptance letters this week, while California, New York and New Jersey are home to the most applicants.
Deacon described New Jersey as “historically a net exporter of students, because they have no elite state universities and a fairly affluent population.”
Trends are similar in New York, Deacon said
Like last year, more women than men were admitted, Deacon said: 1,901 women were accepted compared to 1,567 men. This corresponds to the national trend of more women going to college, but Georgetown is closer to an even 50-50 split.
“By having a school of business, it balances out a bit,” Deacon said.
While Deacon cited multiple factors that can influence a student’s decision about where to apply and where to go to college, he said that Georgetown’s location sets it apart.
“These students are looking at elite universities so they have hard choices to make,” Deacon said. He cited Georgetown’s location in Washington, D.C., as a draw that consistently sets it apart from other top schools.
Deacon said the overwhelming interest in attending the first Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program weekend was a good sign.
“We had to turn people away,” Deacon said, citing space considerations.

Slowly bringing her arm forward and flexing it in a form reminiscent of Rosie the Riveter, Nicole Cimbak (NHS ’12) poses before a simple black screen in Sellinger Lounge. Written in Sharpie across her bicep are the words, “We Can Do It.”
“Take a step back. Now without moving your head, put your eyes on me. Just a little more, perfect,” Robert Fogarty says to her, snapping the first official Dear World photograph at Georgetown University.
Dear World, a project founded by social entrepreneur and photographer Robert Fogarty earlier this month, captures originality, creativity and inspiration through the black ink participants scrawl on their fingers, palms and arms. Dear World is an expansion of Dear New Orleans, which was founded last year as a socially conscious venture in which individuals wrote love letters addressed to a grief stricken city on their bodies. Icons such as Super Bowl winning quarterback Drew Brees and Academy Award winner Susan Sarandon posed for Fogarty’s original project.
When an earthquake struck Haiti in 2010, Dear New Orleans became an avenue through which to voice solidarity with the victims.
“That was the moment I knew that Dear World had legs,” Fogarty said.
It was not until March that Fogarty felt prepared to transform the project into a global initiative. The invitation to deliver the keynote address at the Harvard Social Enterprise Conference served as the springboard he needed for an international endeavor.
“We have written messages to the world in 17 languages. I want that number next year to be 100,” Fogarty said.
This ambitious goal brought Dear World to Georgetown, the second stop on a university tour that began at Harvard and will also include Duke University and Tulane University. Fogarty agreed to do the Georgetown photo shoot in Sellinger for free, while the Georgetown University Student Association funded the advertising and room reservation costs.
Cimbak was one of several Georgetown students who chose to write inspirational messages on their arms or hands and pose for Fogarty. She heard about the Dear World photo shoot on Facebook and was inspired by the social and humanitarian roots of the project. Cimbak’s message was primarily a statement of strength and solidarity for Haitians struggling to recover from the devastating quake, but she felt that her photograph could also act as message to the Georgetown community.
“I wanted to send a message to people that you are stronger than you think you are and can get through a lot more than you realize,” Cimbak said.
“Dear World Live at Georgetown” was organized by Mary Willis (COL ’13) and Lily Cowles (NHS ’13) and led by GUSA senator Tyler Sax (COL ’13), who participated in Dear New Orleans. The trio advertised the event and ran its Facebook page.
“When people see these pictures, they are immediately drawn to [them],” Sax said.
Brigid Power (COL ’12) became familiar with Dear World through Facebook and decided to participate. Inscribed on her arms were words of Theodore Roosevelt, “Do what you can with what you have, where you are.”
Power stressed the universality of her message.
“Everybody struggles, but it’s about recognizing that everyone is doing their best,” she said.
Power’s photo will be one of many presented during a showcase event Thursday night at 8 p.m. in the Intercultural Center Auditorium. Fogarty will talk about the roots, growth and expectations for the future of Dear World, and the presentation will conclude with a slide show of the photographs taken Monday.
“I gear myself up to know that … someone is going to come up and show something completely amazing and original,” Fogarty said.
In addition to posing for photographs, students were asked to make a one-dollar donation to a local charity and complete the sentence, “This year I will …”, in a testament to the forward thinking infused in the portraits taken and Dear World itself.
“We took this idea and started in this amazing city and now I want photographers all over the world doing this,” Fogarty said. “That is the big mission.”

The Stall Seat Journal is flush with success after tapping into the ultimate captive readership: people in toilet stalls.
The news flier, which is published once every two weeks, is posted on the interior-facing doors of about 400 dormitory communal bathroom stalls. The joint effort began at Georgetown in 2004 as an unusual collaboration among Health Education Services, eight student contributors and the Anheuser-Busch beer company.
Although each issue features a variety of topics — from facts about the basketball teams to tips for eating at O’Donovan Hall — the journal primarily aims to educate students about alcohol consumption as part of a national social norms initiative. Each issue features a brief fact about college alcohol consumption, such as “Most Hoyas have zero to four drinks while partying.”
Tessa Telly, Georgetown’s social norms coordinator who works under Health Education Services, said that campaigns for universal abstinence from alcohol are unrealistic. According to statistics, 80 percent of students on campus drink.
“We do support students who chose not to drink,” Telly said, “but for those students who do drink, we don’t want them to think that if they are going to drink, they have to drink a whole lot because that is what the majority of students are doing.”
The Stall Seat Journal — one of many college publications of the same name  — is funded primarily by a grant from the Anheuser-Busch beer company, which provided Georgetown over $60,000 for 2010-2012. According to its website, the company has given nearly $8 million since 1999 for college social norms initiatives.
Anheuser-Busch also funds the National Social Norms Institute, which advises Georgetown on crafting its social norms message. Adrienne Keller, the Institute’s research director, said NSNI aims for “harm reduction.”
“Our focus is not on moderation, per se, or on abstinence, per se, but rather on correcting misperceptions,” Keller explained, “including misperceptions about the number of people who use in moderation and the number of people who chose to abstain — both are commonly underestimated in a college population.”
Keller said that the NSNI has not run into opposition from groups who may favor total alcohol abstinence on college campuses. According to the institute’s website, some colleges that have adopted the social norms campaign have experienced an over 40 percent drop in “heavy episodic alcohol consumption” over several years.
Statistics from National College Health Assessment surveys indicate reduced drinking among Georgetown students from 2004 to 2010. The average number of drinks students reported most recently drinking dropped from roughly five to four. Students who reported suffering physical injury from drinking also dropped 4 percent.
The Stall Seat Journal originated at the University of Virginia in 1999 and has since spread to campuses across the country. Georgetown dramatically remodeled its version in 2007, and now features flashier layouts and more brazen topics such as romance and sexual safety.
“Our main goal is to pull student’s attention in, and then we include facts about alcohol,” Telly explained.
Health Education Services conducted a survey in 2010 to assess the program’s progress. Of students surveyed, 86 percent said the Stall Seat Journal is “Very/Moderately Useful.” In addition, 93 percent of respondents could recall at least one of the program’s four main campaign statistics regarding social norms, and 41 percent said they use responsible drinking tips contained in the Journal.
Anushka Singh (MSB ’14), a first-year contributor to the publication, was surprised by the level of freshman alcohol consumption when she arrived on the Hilltop as an international student.
“When I came here during orientation week I was shocked because so many people just went all out,” Singh said. “I think people were going with the goal of I’m going to drink, I’m going to overdo it, I’m going to throw up. But that’s not what it’s really like here.”
Singh said that many students are surprised to learn how moderate Georgetown drinking is when they read statistics on the Stall Seat Journal. “We present our information from a more approachable stance,” she said. “It’s not some authoritative ‘no, don’t drink!’ We know you are going to drink, but be smart about it. Instead of having people go by perceptions, we give them the real picture.”
