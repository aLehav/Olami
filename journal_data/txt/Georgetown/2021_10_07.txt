Some student organizations have reported a lack of communication from the Center for Student Engagement (CSE) after the director and associate director both left their positions in mid-September.
Before their departure, Aysha Dos, former director of the CSE, and Jaime Brown, former associate director of the CSE, served as the two highest-ranking professional staff members in CSE. Until the university hires replacements for Dos and Brown, Kris Nessler, who currently serves as the CSE’s director of outdoor education, will serve as the interim director, according to a university spokesperson. 
Dos said she has been lucky to have worked with her CSE colleagues.
“Over the past 3 years here on the Hilltop, I have been incredibly lucky to be surrounded by amazing and talented colleagues,” Dos wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Brown did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment.
The CSE works collaboratively with student organizations around co-curricular activities on campus. One of the CSE’s main responsibilities is overseeing the distribution of student activity fees, which provide over $1 million to various student-run clubs, as well as offering guidance to clubs and student organizations. 
Christopher Boose, chair of Georgetown University College Democrats (GUCD) said GUCD has struggled to receive information regarding public health rules, CSE financial processes and travel requirements and restrictions after the departure of Dos and Brown despite multiple efforts to contact the CSE.
“The unfortunate truth is that communication has been low this semester. As the University has worked to just bring students back to campus, it sometimes feels as though little thought was given to how student organizations would operate,” Boose wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Their departure means we’re left with a void. Even when their positions are filled, it will likely be hard to fill in those shoes in the middle of such an uncertain period.”
Chair of the International Relations Club (IRC) Emily Hardy (SFS ’23) said the IRC has not received a replacement adviser yet and has struggled to figure out how to process receipts and rent vans from the Center for Social Justice, Research, Teaching & Service, despite multiple attempts to contact CSE staff.
“I still don’t know who our next advisor is. There is a lot of uncertainty even on an operational level,” Hardy said in an interview with The Hoya. “Whose name do we put on forms? I have no idea, and if I have no idea, then all the people who are trying to work within club spaces who don’t have much experience also have no idea.” 
While the CSE transitions its leadership, the university has taken steps to meet clubs’ needs, according to a university spokesperson. 
“CSE is committed to continuing to provide quality advising to our student organizations and to re-establishing official advising roles in the immediate future,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have responded to multiple requests for advising assistance from organizations that had traditionally worked with either the director or associate director; we will continue to work hard to provide this support while we fill those roles.”
Nessler did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment.
While some clubs are upset about the short-term impacts of the leadership transition, others are less concerned about the long-term consequences.
Both Dos’ and Brown’s departures and the subsequent leadership transition will not drastically affect CSE relationships with student organizations, according to Matthew Failor (SFS ’23), chairperson of the Student Activities Commission, an advisory board for most student clubs on campus. 
“Obviously, there have been some issues with the CSE on communication and stuff like that in the past, and that’s not going to go away,” Failor said in an interview with The Hoya. “Nothing’s going to get better because of this, but I don’t necessarily think anything’s going to get worse either. Use the resources that are there, use the staff that are left, and I think clubs will be fine.” 
A university spokesperson said Georgetown is working to hire replacements for Dos and Brown and planning to engage students in the hiring process. The university has hired three new coordinators within the CSE, though the new staff members are still being trained, which may cause advising delays, according to a university spokesperson.
The university must hire people who will communicate with students to help ease clubs’ anxiety, according to Hardy.
“They need to learn how to navigate different club cultures, understand the needs and demands of different organizations and be fluid with what groups need,” Hardy said. “Being available, being there to help students and being willing to sit down with them and talk about how to make things work is important.” 
Still, to Boose, the university must do more to help student organizations on campus.
“The University has failed to prioritize student organizations in preparing for this semester as shown by the difficulties faced by student organizations during this staff transition,” Boose wrote.

Kris Nessler is absolutely not qualified to be serving in this role. He has successfully run Outdoor Education into the ground, so it is hardly surprising that he is doing the same to the rest of the CSE.

The Georgetown Scholars Program (GSP) plans to hold protests next week to demonstrate its continued outrage over the program office’s relocation from Healy Hall. 
Students leaders from GSP, which provides support for first-generation and low income undergraduates, will hold a teach-in with the Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) on Oct. 13 regarding the importance of GSP’s office location in Healy. Following the teach-in, GSP and GUSA plan to hold a sit-in to advocate for GSP’s return to Healy Hall, according to a statement from the GSP Student Board to The Hoya.
Both protests will help inform the student body about GSP’s eviction, according to the GSP Student Board.
“We hope these efforts will gain traction with the larger student body,” the statement said.
GUSA values GSP’s work and is dedicated to supporting the program’s welfare on campus, according to Speaker of the GUSA Senate Leo Rassieur (COL ’22). 
“GSP is a community that is near and dear to our hearts,” Rassieur said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “GUSA’s very passionate about advocating for marginalized communities, and first generation low income students are some who need the most institutional support and who we believe the university should be taking steps to provide more resources to.” 
GSP leaders were first informed in January 2021 that the university planned to move the GSP office to basement office spaces in New South Hall. The move comes as part of a university initiative to consolidate into one space organizations under the Office of Student Equity and Inclusion (OSEI), including GSP, the Women’s Center, the LGBTQ Resource Center, the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access and the Community Scholars Program.
The OSEI consolidation was delayed, however, after a structural engineer found structural concerns in the New South basement offices. 
As a result, university administrators temporarily relocated GSP to a space on the fourth floor of the Leavey Center. The office has not yet opened to students, however, as GSP administrators and student leaders continue to unpack and prepare the office. GSP leaders plan to open the office to students in mid-October, according to the GSP Student Board.
GSP Students first learned of GSP’s move from Healy in August 2021, sparking outrage and concern among both students and graduates, who argued the move would decrease GSP’s visibility and accessibility on campus.
In response to the move, students began circulating a petition on Change.org calling on the university to return GSP to Healy. As of Oct. 6, nearly 1,300 people have signed the petition.  
Prior to the planning of the teach-in and subsequent sit-in, GUSA circulated a separate petition calling on the university to move GSP back to its original location in Healy. As of Oct. 6, the petition had received signatures from over 375 students and 43 organizations.
“A space for GSP isn’t just a physical location, but an embodiment of the University’s commitment to ensuring FGLI students feel welcome and supported throughout their time at Georgetown,” the petition reads. “Healy is a Georgetown landmark, and therefore a symbol that FGLI students not only belong at Georgetown but that they are central to the University’s mission.”
Georgetown is committed to providing GSP a dedicated space on campus, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Our priority is to ensure that all of our student support programs, including GSP, have a strong foundation for continued success,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We hear the concerns being raised as we work to bring together the student resource centers affiliated with the Office of Student Equity and Inclusion and are committed to ensuring that centers serving students have distinct spaces that celebrate independent identities, while also coordinating staff resources to best serve students.”
The university plans to begin renovations in the original GSP office now that the program has moved out of Healy. While there are no definite plans for what will replace GSP in the space, the university will engage students in the decision-making process, according to a university spokesperson. 
Regardless of administrators’ plans for the space, to Rassieur, upcoming demonstrations like the teach-in and sit-in are an important effort in helping GSP return to Healy. 
“I feel like we’re coming together as a community, and I’m confident that we can put a stop to this decision, given just how many students feel so strongly about keeping GSP in their rightful home,” Rassieur said.

I agree with moving GSP to New South. There is a lot more space in the basement for the different groups to work together, imho it’s cozier and less impersonal,  and that’s what our student groups, esp. FGLI, LGBT Resource Center and Women’s Center need (as a member of two of these three groups, I can confidently state this).  We need our own space to grow and New South has ample. While Healy is nice, it’s not a place where I see our groups growing anytime soon.

After nearly two years, throngs of students returned to Red Square to buy artisan food and support local vendors as part of the Georgetown University Farmers’ Market (GUFM).
GUFM, a student-run not-for-profit organization that promotes sustainable agriculture and supports local businesses, returned to Red Square on Oct. 6 at limited operational status. Local vendors included Timber Pizza Co., a mobile wood oven pizza truck; Yoga in a Bowl, an Indian restaurant; Borek-G, a Turkish restaurant; and Maracas Ice Pops, an ice pops vendor. The Farmers’ Market did not operate last year during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The market’s revival signals the comeback of a beloved campus tradition, according to Irmak Şensöz (SFS ’23). 
“I think the Farmers’ Market was something that most students looked forward to a lot every Wednesday, and so just being able to go again — even if the options are pretty limited — is a sign of returning to normal and what Georgetown was once like pre-pandemic,” Şensöz said in an interview with The Hoya. 
In the past, the Farmers’ Market featured 16 vendors from the Washington, D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area, as well as two vendors run by graduates of the Georgetown community. The Farmers’ Market also included 11 pop-up vendors who appeared once during the Farmers’ Market season, which runs during the early fall and late spring.
In past years, the Farmers’ Market has offered a wider range of food options from local vendors, including Ashton Farms, a fruit orchard; Craft Kombucha, a kombucha brewery; Panorama Bakery, an artisan bakery; and DMV Empanadas, a restaurant serving homemade empanadas. 
Tents and limited space in Red Square forced GUFM to scale back the size of the Farmers’ Market, according to GUFM co-director Madeleine O’Hara (SFS ’22).
The Farmers’ Market is enforcing COVID-19 safety measures, including requiring all individuals to be masked while in line, despite university policy allowing fully vaccinated students to not wear masks while outdoors. Vendors are required to be vaccinated against COVID-19, according to O’Hara. 
While the Farmers’ Market is currently offering limited space for vendors, the organization plans to increase its operating status throughout the fall and spring, according to O’Hara. 
“We really just had to kind of give them pretty last-minute notice, so it was whoever wanted to come,” O’Hara said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We’re also kind of starting with a scaled-back amount of vendors to hopefully ramp it up for the regular market season.” 
Although some students noted high costs and long lines, the Farmers’ Market was a welcome alternative to Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall, according to Ella Braunfeld (SFS ’25), who visited the market for the first time Wednesday. 
“I had the Indian chicken rice bowl. It was probably the best $15 I’ve ever spent here at Georgetown,” Braunfeld said in an interview with The Hoya. “It was a bit expensive, but that’s what you get for living in D.C.” 
For Katherine Taulane (COL ’24), despite the long lines, the ability to support local businesses and enjoy the market made it a worthy experience.
“I thought it was really cool,” Taulane said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I liked the different foods they had, and it’s just nice seeing a lot of students gather together to support these different businesses.” 
The return of the Farmers’ Market signals Georgetown’s openness to giving back to the community, according to O’Hara. 
“Ultimately, it’s just an investment in community, and the university having it back I feel like is a sign that they’re willing to invest in community because they know that it’s important to students,” O’Hara said. 
GUFM also collaborates with other university and student organizations. The Georgetown Renewable Energy Environmental Network helps lead composting services at the event, and GUFM donates to the Georgetown Scholars Program’s grocery stipends program.
The Farmers’ Market is an important way for the Georgetown community to come together and enjoy a break in the week, according to O’Hara. 
“It’s a pause where students can get together with their friends and really enjoy each other’s company, and I think it’s such an important community-building part of Georgetown,” O’Hara said. “Georgetown is a very fast-paced school, and this is a chance for students to slow down and enjoy life and being outside and being with friends and fresh food.” 
Braunfeld plans to return to the Farmers’ Market soon. 
“I would go back next Wednesday and try another stand,” Braunfeld said. “All those stands looked amazing, and I want to try all of them. So that’s my goal for the semester: try all the stands there.”

Georgetown University initiated a data collective in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to improve equity in the civil justice system, especially in light of the expired national moratorium on eviction. 
Georgetown has partnered with AWS and is using their strategy of “Working Backwards,” or working from a customer perspective in order to understand an issue and develop a solution, to create a “Civil Justice Data Commons,” a collection of quantitative demographic and financial data from civil courts across the country. 
While experts have completed extensive data analysis on various aspects of criminal justice proceedings, such as demographic trends, there is a severe lack of data on civil cases, according to Amy O’Hara, a research professor in Georgetown’s McCourt School of Public Policy, who pioneered the data collective. 
“There is a movement trying to improve access to judgements,” O’Hara said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “You don’t see enough articles in the newspaper about consumer debt or evictions because there’s just not data like there is on the criminal side, and we should try to tackle that.”
The goal of the data commons is to allow local governments across the nation to use data from civil cases to improve transparency and accountability as it relates to civil justice proceedings across the country, according to O’Hara. 
“Our hope is that you would be able to look at multiple jurisdictions to see where other interventions have succeeded or failed, and to be able to translate that into your area,” O’Hara said.
Moving forward, the project team hopes to focus on eviction as it relates to civil cases, especially as the national eviction moratorium comes to an end, according to Eva Rosen, assistant professor at the McCourt School.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act first created a national eviction moratorium in March 2020. After the original moratorium expired July 31, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attempted to reestablish the eviction pause with an Aug. 3 order. The renewal was subsequently blocked by the Supreme Court on Aug. 26, leaving an estimated 3.5 million people at risk of eviction. 
In October 2020, Rosen and Brian McCabe, an associate professor of sociology in the 
College at Georgetown, compiled data from the Washington, D.C. court system to track eviction filings and formal evictions from 2014 to 2018 as part of a separate project. 
The report of their findings revealed that one out of nine D.C. renters are impacted by the eviction process, and a high concentration of evictions occur in Wards 7 and 8, where many Black and low-income residents live. 
“With housing instability and eviction concentrated in majority-Black neighborhoods located in Ward 7 and Ward 8, addressing housing inequality is an issue central to racial justice in Washington, DC,” the report reads. 
Wards 7 and 8 only account for a quarter of rentals throughout D.C., but they account for almost 57% of evictions, according to the report. 
The team is working to collect data available under public record laws; however, data collections tend to be disaggregated and difficult to sift through, according to O’Hara.
“We’re trying to facilitate access to the data so that you can do quantitative research and access more from multiple courts and multiple years,” O’Hara said. 
The project began several years ago, when McCourt conducted interviews with people in the legal field to see where there was a need for a public data commons. However, the team initially lacked a clear goal to inform their vision for accessible data, O’Hara said. 
However, now that they have implemented the “Working Backwards” strategy, the team can think critically about what data would be most valuable and how to present it, according to O’Hara.
“Working Backwards helps you think about how you would then approach the problem in order to build the right solution,” O’Hara said. “So they prodded us along and had us ask lots of questions and then come up with the answers to those questions which was really useful when you’re considering product design.”
Georgetown’s data commons will allow policymakers to easily gather data about issues like eviction, and eventually to enact change, according O’Hara. 
“Whether you are a nonprofit or a policymaker, being able to see what’s happening across sights and being able to draw inferences that might inform what you’re going to do on the ground is vital,” O’Hara said.

Students are voicing accessibility concerns following an email to community members stating that professors will not be required to provide virtual attendance options for class. 
Rohan Williamson, vice provost for education, sent an email to Georgetown University students Sept. 30 outlining the university’s commitment to an in-person semester, emphasizing that students should not expect professors to provide opportunities for asynchronous or synchronous virtual participation. As COVID-19 and other viral illnesses spread through campus, students have posed concerns about health and safety, especially for immunocompromised people.  
According to Andrew Bialek (COL ’22), president of the Georgetown Disability Alliance (GDA), not all students who feel uncomfortable attending classes in person have a registered disability status with the university — which would provide them with alternative attendance accomodations — and the process to gain such recognition can be lengthy. 
Before this email, students may have felt more comfortable requesting virtual options without formal accommodations from the university, but now may experience difficulty accessing alternatives to attending class in person, according to Bialek.
“Previously, people had the opportunity through speaking to their professors to be able to attend class either virtually or for whatever reason. And the onus now is on the individual student to attend class,” Bialek said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. 
In order to receive an accommodation for any disability, students must submit documentation of their disability written by a qualified professional to the Academic Resource Center. After reviewing the documentation, the Academic Resource Center decides upon the appropriate accommodation. 
Students who are concerned about risks to their health but don’t have formally approved reasons to miss class are now forced to weigh their wellbeing against the consequences of not attending in person, according to Dominic DeRamo (COL ’23).
“As an immunocompromised student, there have been numerous unapproved situations in which I would have been more comfortable attending class virtually,” DeRamo wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In light of the Provost’s email on September 30th, I am even more hesitant to have these conversations with my professors because I know that I would be asking for something that the university has explicitly discouraged.”
In addition to continued COVID-19 concerns, Georgetown has recently faced a norovirus outbreak, with over 145 community members reporting symptoms consistent with the highly contagious gastrointestinal illness. The main campus also experienced an outbreak of Influenza A in mid-September, with 65 confirmed cases as of Sept. 16.
DeRamo says because in-person attendance policies are up to professors’ discretion, he is grateful for professors who are taking steps to make their classrooms more flexible.
“In my experience, most professors are offering a Zoom option for students that test positive for COVID,” DeRamo wrote. “Besides that, there has been a lot of variety in professors’ approaches to flexible attendance policies.”
As was the typical policy before the COVID-19 pandemic, students now are expected to contact their deans and professors if feeling ill, according to a university spokesperson. 
“To this end, faculty members have been encouraged to accommodate students by making course materials available to students missing classes due to COVID-19-related isolation or quarantine, or other symptoms and illnesses, based upon course content and pedagogy,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Faculty are also encouraged to use lecture capture software if appropriate for their courses.”
The disability accommodations process is very individualistic and requires students to work with outside organizations to receive this approval, according to Bialek.
“It’s not automatically granted in most situations, meaning it would both take time but it would also take some additional resource beyond the university itself to to receive said accommodation,” Bialek said. 
According to DeRamo, students and faculty should facilitate open conversations about accessibility following the provost’s email.
“I know that professors and administrators are willing to listen to students’ concerns, but we need to have conversations about how we can act upon them,” DeRamo wrote. “The Provost’s email on September 30th seemingly discourages conversations about flexibility and accessibility in a time when students most need them.”

A Georgetown University professor received a $64,000 grant to complete a study investigating the effects of an increased minimum wage on healthcare workers. 
McCourt School of Public Policy professor Krista Ruffini, who received the grant, is an economist whose research focuses on the effect of public policy on labor, education and health in disadvantaged populations. Ruffini will use the grant to examine how raising the minimum wage influences nursing home employees in collaboration with Asvhin Gandhi, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
Nursing homes are significant employers of minimum-wage workers, many of whom remain in the long-term care industry throughout their careers, making the nursing home industry an ideal case study. Thanks to the grant, Ruffini and Gandhi will have the resources to gather empirical evidence — or on-the-ground observations — on how minimum wage reforms change the hourly distribution of labor and organizational composition of nursing homes. The grant came from Equitable Growth, a non-profit organization dedicated to research and grantmaking related to promoting economic growth.
The majority of nursing home employees are non-white people and women, demographics that are crucial to the study of the minimum wage, according to Ruffini.
“Women and Black and Hispanic workers are more likely to earn low wages than are men and non-Hispanic white workers,” Ruffini wrote in an email to The Hoya. “So changes in the minimum wage raise interesting questions around pay gaps by gender, race, and ethnicity.”
Inequitable wage earnings are pervasive across demographic groups. As of 2020, women in the United States were paid 82 cents for every dollar their male counterparts made in wages, according to a 2020 report from the National Women’s Law Center. The pay gap between white women and women of color is even greater; compared to white women, Black women make $24,110 less annually and Latina women make $29,098 less annually.   
The research team hypothesizes that with a higher minimum wage, workers will remain in their current positions for longer, leading to more experience throughout the field, according to Ruffini.
“We expect that higher minimum wages might reduce the share of workers who leave their employers — in economic jargon, their opportunity cost,” Ruffini wrote. “If we do see fewer workers leaving their employers, we might expect that the firm’s overall workforce becomes more experienced over time.”
The project aims to collect micro-data, or statistics grounded in the individual experiences of employees in the nursing home industry, according to Gandhi.
“We hope to use the individual-level nature of the data to understand whether minimum wage affects who firms hire and fire,” Gandhi wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The micro-data will offer a variety of measures to observe the effect of wage changes, according to Ruffini. 
“Our data provide us with a daily measure of hours worked for each worker, so we can track things like how many hours an employee works; whether that worker’s schedule becomes more or less stable (e.g.: whether the worker works the same weekly schedule); whether the worker is working part-time or overtime hours; and whether the worker is newly hired or leaves his/her position,” Ruffini wrote.
Collecting empirical evidence on the distribution of hours among workers and scheduling practices is critical to understanding how minimum wage increases affect employees’ working lives, according to Korin Davis, the academic program director at Equitable Growth. 
“There is a large literature exploring the tension between increasing minimum wages in order to raise the hourly wages of workers, and having these increases off-set by reductions in overall employment or hours worked by low-wage employees,” Davis wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Therefore, understanding the distributional impacts of minimum wage increases is essential.”
McCourt School Dean Maria Cancian said the study may result in key findings for agencies to inform their decisions about minimum wage. 
“I look forward to the results, and how they may inform proposals around minimum wage at the federal and local levels,” Cancian wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Georgetown University students rallied for reproductive rights during the fifth Women’s March last Saturday. 
The 2021 Women’s March advocated for reproductive rights after legislators passed a new abortion law in Texas, which made abortions after six weeks of pregnancy illegal. Protestors participated in the Women’s March on Oct. 2 in all 50 states, garnering 70,000 participants, 10,000 of which marched in Washington, D.C. 
H*yas for Choice (HFC), a pro-abortion rights student group, held an event to make signs for the march and organized a group of students to attend the march together. 134 students signed up to attend the Women’s March with HFC, according to Lauryn Ping (COL ’23), organizing director for HFC. 
“There’s a lot going on around abortion right now, and reproductive rights and justice are really in jeopardy, so I think there’s a lot of student concern around abortion rights and abortion justice,” Ping said. “I’m really encouraged by the turnout.”
For students like Soraya Bata (SFS ’24), who is from Florida, attending the Women’s March was an opportunity to become involved in a large-scale event in Washington, D.C.
“I had always really wanted to participate in some form of activism, especially for feminist causes, but I haven’t really had the opportunity,” Bata said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “When I heard that there was going to be a Women’s March specifically for reproductive justice, I knew that I had to attend and be part of that movement.”
 The first Women’s March took place the day after President Trump’s inauguration in 2017 with participants rallying to protect reproductive rights. The event took place during a time of high popularity for the #MeToo movement, founded by Tarana Burke in 2006 to advocate for justice for survivors of sexual violence. 
Nadia Sandanandan (NHS ’24) was motivated to attend the Women’s March after learning about the new Texas abortion law. 
“I actually went to the Women’s March in 2017 after Trump got elected,” Sandanandan said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I wanted to go to this one was because after the Texas law, I was very frustrated.”
The event began with the “Rally for Abortion Justice” at Freedom Plaza, where protestors gathered to listen to speeches from prominent activists, including Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood, and Marsha Jones, executive director of the Afiya Center, a Texas-based abortion rights organization.
According to Bata, the speakers delivered empowering, inspiring speeches to the crowd in Freedom Plaza. 
“I think that the diversity of the participants in the event was what inspired me most because I noticed that there were people of all ages, all genders and all races participating and marching,” Bata said. “I had anticipated that to a certain extent, but I just didn’t realize the gravity of how diverse the movement really was.”
After the “Rally for Abortion Justice,” protestors formed a large crowd that marched toward the steps of the Supreme Court, according to Bata.
“As we were walking toward the Supreme Court and toward Capitol Hill, we turned around and saw the crowd behind us, and it just didn’t end,” Bata said. “As far as we could see, the road was completely packed with activists, and that made us really emotional because we felt like we were part of a really strong community there.” 
While the march was a positive experience, Sadanandan said the event also evoked feelings of discouragement after years of protesting for reproductive rights. 
“I definitely think it made me feel more hopeful, but it’s also frustrating that we keep having to fight for the same things for a really long time,” Sadanandan said. 
Ping said the participants at the Women’s March conveyed a message to representatives across the country that reproductive justice is a right that should be protected. 
“It’s a really awesome opportunity to come together in solidarity around reproductive justice,” Ping said. “It’s also a way to tell our representatives in Congress and the president that reproductive justice is something that students and the general American population wants and is super important.”

Georgetown University Votes (GU Votes) hosted its fifth annual drive for National Voter Registration Day on Sep. 28, registering an estimated over 100 students to vote.  
Voter registration tables were set up at multiple locations on campus including the Leavey Center and Red Square, as well as first-year dorms New South Hall, Harbin Hall and Copley Hall. GU Votes’ registration drive was run by approximately roughly 50 student volunteers, according to GU Votes Director of Operations Shelby Benz (SFS ’23). GU Votes is a non-partisan, student-led organization that aims to educate students about the importance of voting and increasing student voter turnout rates.
While GU Votes typically targets first-year students during these annual registration drives, the organization also sought to register sophomores who did not get a chance to participate in an event last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Benz. 
“There was ample opportunity to reach a lot of students who might not have thought about registering to vote yet. Freshmen are traditionally less likely to be registered coming into college because they’ve just reached that benchmark of being 18,” Benz said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “But also we’ve missed our opportunity to work with the current sophomores, the former freshmen, last year because we all were in this nebulous online school situation.” 
Nationwide, younger people are less likely to vote than older people, with fewer than half of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 voting in the 2016 presidential election, 13 points less than the overall voter turnout of the cycle. During the 2018 midterm elections, Georgetown students exceeded the national voting rate of students who live on college campuses, with 49% of students voting. 
Although they were not involved in organizing the event, the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition (GBC) supported GU Votes’ efforts by posting about the drive on social media, according to Matteo Caulfield (COL ’23), president of GBC.  
“As an organization dedicated to expanding civic participation and bipartisan cooperation, Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition promotes and encourages the undertakings of GU Votes’ voter registration drive campaigns,” Caulfield wrote in a statement to The Hoya. 
The opportunity to table inside first-year dorms, which is usually not allowed for student organizations, helped to encourage first years to register to vote, according to Natalie Long (COL ’22), director of communications for GU Votes. 
“No other student organizations are ever allowed to table in the dorms, but they make an exception for us on National Voter Registration Day,” Long said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “It’s kind of our idea of getting in the freshman dorms right when everyone is walking to class, coming back, so they just see us and it’s something they can stop by really quickly and register.” 
 The organization is housed under the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service and partners with the Andrew Goodman Foundation, which encourages youth leadership development and voting accessibility on college campuses.
The positive relationship between GU Votes and Residential Living contributed to the success of the drive, according to Benz.
“It’s really special that residential living actually lets us table in these dorms because normally tabling is off-limits, but it’s such an important cause and it’s non-partisan and it really makes a difference what we’re doing so the fact that we have that exception is pretty incredible,” Benz said. 
In addition to their annual voter registration drive, GU Votes has online resources to help students register to vote and request absentee ballots.
Benz said that voting is key in perpetuating social change. 
“Voting is an act of self-love,” Benz said. “It’s an act of caring for yourself and for your family and for your community and for your nation. Change is a slow and gradual process, but positive change is able to be made when everyone has a stake in our democracy and uses their voice and mobilizes and activates to make change happen, to demand change, to build a better, more resilient, more equitable society.”
