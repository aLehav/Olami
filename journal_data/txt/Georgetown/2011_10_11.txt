A Nevils resident awoke to find an unknown male in his apartment Saturday morning. According to the Department of Public Safety, the unidentified person then stole the student’s backpack after being discovered.
The student reported to DPS that he woke up at around 11:00 a.m. to find the suspect in his apartment, according to a Public Safety Alert emailed to the campus community Monday night.
When the student asked what the suspect was doing, the suspect replied that “he was there to see Joe, and that Joe let him stay there last night,” according to the PSA. The student then told him that no one named Joe lived in that apartment, and the suspect fled with the student’s backpack.
Although the student chased the suspect and attempted to talk with him, the suspect threatened the student and fled in an unknown direction.
The Metropolitan Police Department responded to the scene and canvassed the area in conjunction with DPS. The search returned no results. MPD is continuing to investigate the incident.
The suspect was described as a black male in his late twenties, with a dark complexion and medium build. He was last seen wearing dark clothing and carrying an Adidas drawstring backpack.
Since September 1, there have been 11 burglaries reported by DPS.
