Trebizond Investments, LLC, a private, student-run investment group, liquidated its investments to merge with Georgetown Collegiate Investors, LLC Feb. 2, creating the country’s largest private, student-run investment group.
Trebizond’s private equity branch, Trebizond Capital Partners, will remain independent.
The two groups were competitors but decided to consolidate their efforts after negotiations throughout the fall semester.
“It really doesn’t make sense to have duplicate clubs on campus trying to do the same thing,” GCICEO Joseph McIlhattan (COL ’14) said.
Trebizond, which had 150 members, was founded in 2011 by current CEO Caspian Tavallali (SFS’14), who had previously been secretary of GCI. The two groups used similar investment models, with club members providing money for investment. However, GCI, which was founded in 1997, bases their approach on a four-year horizon, while Trebizond focused on short-term investment in a volatile market — differences Tavallali and McIlhattan said will complement each other under the new, united organization.
“Where GCI lacks, I think Trebizond provides, and vice versa,” Tavallali said. “I think it’s a solid company, which we are supporting and expanding.”
“We are hoping to take some of the good stuff [that Trebizond did], and then … use our investment strategy that has worked, and, hopefully, we’ll get a great result,” McIlhattan added. “They bring capital and talent to the table, which we are excited about. I am glad that Trebizond is joining our model.”
According to McIlhattan, one of Trebizond’s greatest strengths is its use of a blog system called Capitalist Connect, which allows members to post potential stock ideas, check investment rationale and keep record of the club’s transactions.
“We looked at Trebizond, and we saw something we liked. They had been using technology in ways that are very innovative,” McIlhattan said.
Not every Trebizond member will necessarily join GCI, in part because GCI requires every member to contribute $250 that is returned upon graduation. Trebizond did not require members to contribute any money to its investment portfolio, as most of Trebizond’s funds were contributed by Tavallalihimself.
Tavallali expects Trebizond’s members to add $25,000 to GCI’s $80,000, while McIlhattan was less optimistic, expecting approximately 20 new members, which would bring $5,000 to the club.
GCI has taken steps to incorporate Trebizond’s members into its management structure by extending deadlines for applications to middle management positions. Tavallali is now chief development officer of GCI and plans to pitch some of Trebizond’s stock ideas to GCI.
“We are respecting prior experience from that [Trebizond] fund,” McIlhattan said.
GCI hopes to reach its goal of $100,000 in total investments before May — a goal that is more feasible with Trebizond’s added resources. Last year, the club had reached $95,000 before returning the graduating seniors’ investments.
Trebizond members are intrigued by the new group’s potential.
“I have cautious optimism,” Trebizond member Maxwell Roberts (COL ’16) said. “It can be difficult to merge, but in the end the two combined companies can have much success.”

Outgoing U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta called on students and members of Congress to take action to solve American security and budget issues in an address in Gaston Hall Wednesday morning.
Panetta referred to America’s economic and military crises as a crossroads that poses threats to the nation’s security and growth.
“How we confront these problems, how we deal with these challenges will, in many ways, determine that future course of America,” Panetta said. “It will determine whether the United States will be a leader in the 21st century or whether we will be just another failed empire in history.”
In order for the country to succeed, Panetta said that national leadership must act proactively to apprehend and avoid crisis rather than waiting for and responding to problems.
“[We] govern in our democracy either through leadership or through crisis,” Panetta said. “If leadership is there, and there are those that are elected who are willing to take the risks associated with leadership, to make the tough decisions that have to be made, then hopefully crisis can be avoided. But if leadership is not there, if it’s absent for whatever reason, then make no mistake about it — crisis drives policy in this country.”
Warning that such crises create uncertainty in public opinion, Panetta spoke about the Department of Defense’s role in lowering the national deficit. Panetta said that the department must become more agile and project power in the Pacific while maintaining more than one enemy at a time in order to sustain national security.
“This can’t be about cutting. It has to be about investing,” Panetta said. “Budgets are not just numbers. Budgets are about priorities. And so what are our priorities that we have to invest in for the future?”
Panetta said that risk comes from inadequate legislation and decision-making.
“[Frankly,] we’re going to need legislation. We’ve asked for legislation from the Congress to try to give us the tools we need — the legal tools we need so that we can develop a partnership with the private sector to be able to confront these challenges,” Panetta said. “What creates a serious risk today is the pervasive budget uncertainty that threatens our security and threatens our economic future.
Panetta described the urgent threat of sequestration, a tool in federal budget control that leads to automatic spending cuts. Panetta said that these cuts would lead to declines in defense, education, childcare, law enforcement and the American standard of life.
“No one that I’ve talked to doesn’t think that [sequestration] is a dangerous tool to impact the country,” Panetta said. “Make no mistake, if these cuts happen, there will be a serious disruption in defense programs and a sharp decline in our military readiness. We have already begun an all-out effort to plan for how to operate under such a scenario. But it’s all also very clear that there are no good options.”
Panetta encouraged Republican and Democratic decision makers to work together to implement a practical plan.
“My fear is that there is a dangerous and callous attitude that is developing among some Republicans and some Democrats that these dangerous cuts can be allowed to take place in order to blame the other party for the consequences,” Panetta said. “This is a kind of ‘so what?’ attitude that says, ‘Let’s see how bad it can get in order to have the other party blink.’”
Panetta, a graduate of Santa Clara University, opened his address by thanking Georgetown for educating key public service leaders and maintaining its Jesuit identity.
“I want to thank you for the invitation to be here and to hopefully give you one of my last speeches as Secretary of Defense,” Panetta said. “It’s appropriate that I do this at Georgetown. As the product of Jesuit education, as a Catholic and as a beneficiary, over the years, of your outstanding faculty and staff and your important policy contributions that this university has made in a number of areas that affect people of this country, I’m truly honored to have this opportunity today.”
Panetta said that his Catholic upbringing and Jesuit education influenced his morals and value system.
“It was that education and my Catholic upbringing — particularly as the son of Italian immigrants — that instilled in me the very core principles and values that I carry with me to this day,” Panetta said. “My faith, my belief in hard work, my belief that you have to give something back to this country — that’s what a democracy is all about, my belief in knowing the difference between right and wrong.”
Before opening the floor to questions, Panetta urged the students to hold elected leaders accountable for strengthening the country.
“We bless ourselves with the hope that everything’s going to be okay in this country. But very frankly, it won’t mean a thing unless you’re willing to fight for it,” Panetta said. “So my message to you, the students in this audience, is that doesn’t mean a thing if you are not willing to fight for the American dream. That torch of duty is now passing to a new generation, and with it passes the responsibility to never stop fighting for that better future.”
Panetta inspired members of the audience while surprising them with his serious tone and subject matter.
“I really enjoyed it, and I thought it was really interesting that he spoke so much about the budget and fiscal matters because I thought he was going to talk more about the military capacity and the shift to Asia,” Stephanie Lella, a graduate student at Georgetown’s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, said. “I didn’t think he was going to talk so much about Congress and all the issues that are facing it. It was refreshing and very important.”

Catherine Merwin (NHS ’15) spent an hour last semester identifying emotions in photographs and measuring how quickly she could press various buttons. She was one of 115 students to participate inGRVP Live!, a round-robin of research in psychology, linguistics and neuroscience held by the Georgetown Research Volunteer Program.
GRVP is a research collaboration between students and professors that aims to increase student involvement and individual learning in psychology, linguistics and neuroscience.
“It’s a place to bring together the principal investigators who are running the studies and are looking to connect with students and the broader community,” GRVP principal investigator and founder Rachel Barr said.
Professors and students research everything from language and memory in children to changes in learning, memory and performance with aging, though study participants are unaware of what is being tested while they are participating in the experiments.
“[The experiments] were interesting, and it made me wonder what they were testing,” Merwin said.
Many students who participate in GRVP and GRVP Live! are encouraged to do so by their professors, with extra credit as a common incentive. Students are paid for participation in some studies that do not offer course credit.
The program offers an intensive way to complete multiple studies in a short amount of time. GRVPstarted the event, which is held once a semester, in January 2012, and hopes to see increased participation from both undergraduates and the outside community at this semester’s session Feb. 19.
“Over the past few years we’ve focused a lot on undergraduate research, and we really want to make sure that we can keep that growing, and now we want to turn our attention toward community involvement,” Barr said.
Residents of the Washington, D.C., area can sign up through the GRVP database to be contacted if they qualify for specific studies. The psychology subject pool database SONA, however, specifically allows Georgetown undergraduates to independently select studies they qualify for and would like to participate in.
“Participation from [those outside Georgetown] is not as strong as participation from those that are in [Georgetown] courses, but it’s something that we’re trying to build up right now,” GRVP Participant Coordinator Conor Piercey (NHS ’15) said. “It’s not that we really have had difficulty doing it, it’s that our focus has been on campus, and right now we’re trying to branch out a bit more.”
Barr added that increased participation would improve the studies’ results and validity.
“We have a whole lot of questions that we’re interested in about how people are functioning, so we want as many people to answer those questions, as many people to be involved, as possible,” Barr said.
Students interested in psychology and other disciplines enjoy participating in studies.
“[GRVP] opened my eyes to all the research that’s going on,” Piercey said. “I thought it would be a good way personally to get involved in some research and to help everyone else as well.”

As the only ticket without prior GUSA experience, Spencer Walsh (MSB ’14) and Rob Silverstein (SFS ’14) are confident that their fresh perspectives could be an asset to the university community.
“People in GUSA in general work very hard, but they tend to be very narrowly focused on GUSA. We come from a different background with no GUSA experience, which we believe helps us take a more aggressive approach,” Walsh said.
Silverstein cited the pair’s involvement in clubs ranging from the Philodemic Society to the Georgetown University Cycling Team as instrumental to their relationship with the student body.
“We aren’t a part of that bureaucracy, so we understand student frustrations about space and events,” Silverstein said. “We have out-of-the-box ideas for how to make things work better.”
Walsh referred to the GUSA website — which was down for more than a semester — as an example of the university’s bureaucratic inefficiency. He stressed his commitment to creating a centralized space-booking system and a system tracking the promises he and Silverstein make throughout their campaign.
“The simple websites … can be built with or without university support,” Walsh said.
Walsh and Silverstein’s ideas include replacing advisory board approval for student group events with a general event contract declaring “presumed consent,” arranging shuttle buses from the parking lot outside the McDonough Arena directly to Verizon Center on game days, developing a discount for mass student deliveries from Safeway and expanding shuttles to airports and Union Station before major holidays.

Workers at O’Donovan Hall delivered a letter of protest to Aramark managers Wednesday afternoon to request the creation of a joint committee that would address complaints about working conditions and provide input on food sustainability and training.
“I’m ready. I’m tired of the harassment,” Nini Brown, a Leo’s worker and delegation member, said. “I feel my job is in jeopardy every day I clock in.”
The proposed committee would consist of workers, students, Aramark officials and university administrators.
Georgetown Solidarity Committee, an organization that advocates for the rights of workers at Georgetown, has launched the “Real Food, Real Jobs” campaign to bring fair jobs and healthy dining options to D.C. cafeterias. Student members of GSC backed the Leo’s workers in their letter delegation and delivered letters of their own Wednesday to the offices of University President John J.DeGioia and Cal Watson, director for business policy and planning.
Leo’s workers who were not on shift, GSC members and other supporters congregated in the lower kitchen area of the dining hall at 3 p.m. in hopes of delivering the letter to Aramark management. The group then entered the office of the district executive chef Stephen Winterling, who initially refused to speak with them.
“You’ve got to back up,” he said. “You’re supposed to call ahead and tell us that you’re coming to us. If you would like to let me know ahead of time, absolutely.”
Management was particularly vocal in its opposition to having students in the lower kitchen. The students had entered under the supervision of union representative Allison Burket.
“I’ll talk to the stewards. But I cannot have people who don’t work here [in] here. The students can’t be here,” Winterling said. “They’re going to get hurt. It’s a liability issue.”
After Leo’s executives cleared the students out of the kitchen and called the Department of Public Safety, many Aramark members left the cafeteria. However, upper management eventually accepted the proposal letter, which was received by a district chef.
“We didn’t delegate the person I initially wanted to delegate, the general manager. He had left,” a Leo’s worker who spoke on the condition of anonymity said. “We talked a lot about respect. The message was about how the workers are feeling disrespected. It seems like now that we have the union, [management is] retaliating against us in a slick way. They’re doing so much more than they didn’t do before.”
GSC member Natalia Margolis (SFS ’13) shared the employee’s reasons for staging the delegation.
“There’s been a lot of issues of managers trying to play every loophole they can. The workers have a contract now with the union, but still there’s a lot of intimidation going on,” she said. “We’re doing this after having met with the Leo’s worker committee because we formed a really strong relationship with them.”
According to Margolis, although the Leo’s worker committee is useful in generating dialogue between students and Leo’s employees, further progress requires the input of Aramark workers and university officials on a new joint committee.
Karen Cutler, director of communications for Aramark, declined to comment on the specific event but wrote in an email that workers have alternative means to communicate concerns to their Aramarkmanagers.
“Our employees at Georgetown are represented by a union and covered by a collective bargaining agreement,” she wrote. “This means they agreed to bring their concerns to their union representatives who then bring them to Aramark management on their behalf.  This process for addressing and resolving employee issues and concerns, as well as all of the terms and conditions that are outlined in the collective bargaining agreement, are agreed to by both parties.”
Union representative Allison Burket agreed that a committee could help incorporate workers in more conversations regarding food options in the dining hall.
“Workers are sometimes not seen as important pieces of the puzzle when talking about sustainable food quality, so a committee is one of the ways to get there,” she said.
The letter delegation comes weeks after the Georgetown University Students  Association passed an amendment Jan. 20 to form a Subcommittee on Food Service, which involves the input of students and workers, to improve food quality. But Subcommittee Co-Chair Sam Greco (SFS ’15) said the committee could not advocate for workers’ rights.
“The Subcommittee on Food Service does not have an opinion on or purview toward workers’ rights,” he said.

Former Student Activities Commission Chair and current Director of Student Life ReportImplementation for GUSAJack Appelbaum (COL ’14) and his running mate, former president of the College Republicans Maggie Cleary (COL ’14), prioritize funding reforms in their campaign platform.
Cleary, who ran unsuccessfully for the GUSA executive as a vice presidential candidate in 2012, said Appelbaum’sfocus prompted her to participate in the election again.
“There are still things that I campaigned for last year that still matter to me this year, which is giving students more of a voice and advocating for student groups. I think reforming the funding system certainly does allow students to have more of a say and create a more democratic system,” Cleary said.
Appelbaum identified funding reform as the first step to further reforms that will expand
freedom for student groups to put on more innovative programming.
The pair said they compiled their platform ideas from various student-generated reports, such as Visions for a Sustainable Georgetown and the Student Life Report, from recent campus-wide studies such as the external review of the Office of Student Conduct and from the work and experience of past student leaders.
“The philosophy of the report focuses on student autonomy, increasing accountability and
constant review and recommendation for improvement. That will really help us to go through and have an expansive view of the issues impacting student life,” Appelbaum said.
Distinct to Appelbaum and Cleary’s agenda is a comprehensive list of specific problems and concrete solutions that encompass diverse student life issues, ranging from student safety to social justice.
“In order to increase and maintain the legitimacy of the student association both in the eyes of the students and the administrators, GUSA has to have both short-, medium- and long-term solutions and goals — some short-term victories and some long-term goals to establish students as real stakeholders in campus discussions,” Appelbaum said.

Three-year GUSA veteran Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and his running mate Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) identified their partnership as the central theme of their platform, which is unity of all students.
Tisa said he chose Ramadan as his running mate to provide an outsider’s perspective to complement his familiarity with student government.
“I didn’t want to allow myself, as somebody who has so much GUSA experience, to be blinded by that experience,”Tisa said.
Ramadan agreed that his experience outside GUSA is as an advantage.
“We are a perfect mix of a foot in the door in terms of GUSAbut a foot out in terms of being the bridge to the rest of campus,” Ramadan said.
The pair aims to promote effective use of student space, reform the funding system under the Student Activities Commission, expand free-speech zones on campus and facilitate conversations about sexual assault, all of which they identify as unifying issues that affect all students.
Both Tisa and Ramadan indicated that aligning Georgetown’s core values with student rights is imperative to their platform
“The Catholic identity on campus means ‘no’ right now. It means no contraception, no free speech for a lot of groups, no gender-neutral housing, but we think it should be ‘yes’ to social justice, yes to community service, making these Jesuit values not just buzz words that are thrown around but true things that define our community,” Tisa said.

Tackle Box, a seafood restaurant located at 3245 M St., agreed Wednesday to pay three former workers more than $4,000 to resolve allegations of wage theft.
The conflict featured three workers, one who had been demanding his wages for 18 months and two who had been requesting their delayed pay for six months. After their paychecks bounced, they contacted Tackle Box and were told to try depositing the checks again. As the checks continued to bounce, the workers returned to the restaurant multiple times and were continually rebuffed in their attempts to speak with the owner.
Jose Ramirez, one of the former workers, said that he received $1,300 in bad checks.
“When they paid me in 2011, they wrote me a check and I took it to the bank, but the check bounced because the account didn’t have funds to pay all the employees,” Ramirez said through a translator. “Only those who went to the bank first received their pay.”
The agreement came after D.C. Jobs with Justice, an interest group that advocates for workers’ rights, orchestrated a demonstration at the restaurant to protest the restaurant’s failure to pay the workers.
While pleased with the conflict’s resolution, D.C. Jobs with Justice Education Coordinator Ari Schwartz criticized Tackle Box for delaying the payments.
“The reality of the situation is that … the workers should be paid their checks, their pay, on time,” Schwartz said.
After contacting D.C. Jobs with Justice in July 2012, the workers filed claims with the D.C. Department of Employment Service’s Office of Wage and Hour Compliance, which is responsible for resolving employer-employee conflicts.
The office sent two letters to Tackle Box but received no response. The claims were then forwarded to the office of D.C. Attorney General Irvin Nathan.
It was not until Feb. 1, after Jobs with Justice announced a protest in front of the restaurant scheduled for Feb. 6, that the wife of Tackle Box owner Jonathan Umbel contacted the workers. The two sides reached a settlement late Tuesday, in time to defuse the demonstration.
When asked about the incident, however, restaurant owner Jonathan Umbel said he was unaware of the bounced checks until last week.
“It was brought to our attention last Friday, and it was resolved today. When it was brought to our attention, we took care of it,” Umbel said. “When we got the email from the advocate group, we called the advocate group, we got in touch with the person who runs the advocate group and we settled the claim immediately.”
Schwartz disagreed with Umbel’s timeline.
“In July of 2012, all these workers made attempts to talk to Umbel, and then repeatedly over the next several months, they did the same thing and never were able to see him or speak with him,” Schwartz said.
Demonstrators did not picket in front of Tackle Box Wednesday afternoon as planned because a resolution had been reached; however, they reorganized the protest to take place at the Georgetown Waterfront and advocated for general worker solidarity instead.
University students became involved as a result of collaboration between Jobs with Justice and the Day Laborer Exchange program, an initiative sponsored by Georgetown’s Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor.
Program coordinator Sophia Sepp (SFS ’15) noted that the student body needed to be aware of labor problems in the area.
“I think it’s really important, especially for the Georgetown students and the Georgetown community, to realize that right here, a couple blocks away, there is a blatant issue of wage theft going on that our money is supporting,” Sepp said. “It’s something of a wakeup call, for Georgetown and for the employers, to raise awareness of the issue.”
Around 13 students took part in the protest, which stopped by Tackle Box to watch the workers receive their paychecks before proceeding to the Waterfront. Members of Movimiento Estudiantil Chican@ de Aztlán, the Georgetown Solidarity Committee and GU Occupy dominated the student delegation.
Zenen Jaimes Perez (SFS ’13), a member of MEChA, attended the protest.
“My parents are Mexican immigrants and they are restaurant workers as well,” Perez said. “I’m here to stand in solidarity with the workers here who have lost their wages and who are immigrants to make sure their voices are heard, just like I would want my parents’ voices to be heard.”
Perez cautioned, however, that there were still injustices to be corrected.
“Hopefully this is something that can happen more regularly, but the fact is that every year here in D.C. hundreds of workers experience wage theft,” he said.

Two-year GUSA senator Cannon Warren (SFS ’14) is vying for the GUSA presidency with running mate Andrew Logerfo (COL ’14), accounting controller of Students of Georgetown, Inc.
“A lot of GUSA politicians misinterpret what the power of GUSA is. Mainly, we want to be big advocates for student rights,” Warren said.
Warren and Logerfo’s initiatives include reforming the Student Code of Conduct, improving recycling options on campus and creating a transparent system for tracking work order requests.
The pair emphasized the importance of keeping students engaged.
“The real power that GUSA has is to be lobbyist for students, but that power is only able to be used and applied in its fullest form if you have engagement and involvement of the whole student body,” Logerfo said.
But Warren said that if elected, the pair will seek the right balance between keeping students engaged and eliminating excessive communication.
“We’re definitely going to cut back on emails because those are really annoying. I don’t want to hear about what my GUSA president is doing every week,” Warren said.
Warren also identified rats as an imminent problem the ticket seeks to address.
“We’re going to have a rat-hunting competition. Having this is going to highlight how unacceptable the rat situation is on campus,” he said.
Ultimately, the pair said they want to have fun while pushing their ideas forward.
“I don’t think we’re going to take ourselves way too seriously. We’re not trying to run for GUSA so we can dress up in suits and put it on our resume. We really want to get stuff done,” Warren said.

Rodent droppings and cockroaches were among the eight critical and 11 non-critical health violations cited in Wednesday’s Department of Health inspection that forced gourmet grocery store Dean & Deluca to close its Georgetown location temporarily.
The market section of the store, located at 3276 M St., reopened for business Thursday, but the outdoor cafe remains closed.
A statement released by Katy Foley, an account director atMichelle Lehmann Communications, which represents Dean & Deluca, cited ongoing construction at the Georgetown Park Mall & Shops as a major cause of the violations. Foley said that Dean & Deluca will correct its violations quickly.
“The cafe outside remains closed for service, but only because there are birds that have flown into the open air space,” Foley wrote. “We hope to reopen with full service as soon as possible.”
Acting in response to a complaint, the D.C. Department of Health conducted a health and safety investigation Wednesday atthe grocery store.
Among the most serious violations observed by inspectors were mice droppings and cockroaches, which were found around the cheese section, in the customer service area and in the product display area.
The DOH report said that Dean & Deluca needed to “replace missing weather stripping at the bottom of the glass doors inside of the cafe to prevent rodent and bird activity” and to “seal holes located underneath the sinks inside the prepared food station to eliminate vermin access and possible harborage.”
In addition to the vermin citations, the investigation discovered that the upstairs refrigerator was leaking water onto food. Mold was also found in the ice machine.
Other violations included food being held at improper temperatures, refrigerators without thermometers and food being stored on the floor of the walk-in refrigerator.
Dean & Deluca was forced to close following the inspection because of a DOH policy that mandates automatic suspension if six of more critical violations are found that cannot be corrected on site during the course of the investigation.
Of the store’s eight critical violations, only one, regarding cooling time and temperature, was corrected during the investigation.
Last year, the grocery store was cited for several critical violations by the DOH. However, the store was able to correct enough of the violations during the inspection to avoid closure.
Customers said they would think twice before returning to the grocery store.
“I’m kind of disgusted. I don’t know if I’ll be back there anytime soon,” Hayley Mitchell (NHS ’16) said. “I hate the health hazard, and my health could have been compromised because of Dean & Deluca.”

Georgetown’s faculty is replete with reputable figures across many fields, but the behind-the-scenes process of acquiring these high-profile professors could constitute a course in its own right.
Many who come have experience with public policy, whether in government or the media. Edward Montgomery, dean of the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, spoke of the ways in which Georgetown’s location facilitates its hiring process.
“Our location here in Washington, D.C., offers a unique opportunity to bring in current and former members of Congress and other top policy practitioners to teach and speak at Georgetown,” Montgomery said.
GPPI in particular attracts prominent public figures such as Paul Begala, a political commentator and former advisor to President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68), and, most recently, former Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), who will join the faculty as a visiting distinguished professor of public policy in the spring.
“We are constantly searching for top-quality faculty members to join our community at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute,” Montgomery said.
While Montgomery said that high-profile individuals will at times approach the university for positions, School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster explained that the process of recruiting public figures can be a matter of connections. Often, either university leadership or outsiders with friends who work at Georgetown approach potential faculty to gauge their interest in working at the Hilltop.
“We’re always on the lookout for interesting people who can enrich our offerings to students and faculty, so if somebody else comes along, there might be an opportunity to engage them,” Lancaster said.
Donna Brazile, Al Gore’s campaign manager in his 2000 presidential bid and vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, was approached by the department chair at the time to teach at the university.
Brazile said that after initial conversations with university officials, she was asked to put together a proposal and syllabus.
While there are myriad motivations for notable political figures to take an academic position at Georgetown, many, like Brazile, are passionate about education.
“I carve out one day of my life to spend time on campus,” Brazile, who has been an adjunct professor in the Women and Gender Studies department since 2002, said. “I enjoy teaching — it’s the highlight of my week.”
Others have had previous careers at the university level.
Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright taught Eastern European studies at Georgetown before joining the Clinton administration. She is currently the Michael and Virginia Mortara Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy.
Albright usually teaches “America’s National Security Toolbox” twice a year, devoting a semester each to undergraduates and graduate students.
According to one of her teaching assistants, Peter Billerbeck (GRD ’13), the former secretary is heavily involved in the formation and conduct of the course.
“[Secretary Albright] is really passionate about designing the finer points of the course,” Billerbeck said. “She really does engage with every little thing on the syllabus and has an opinion on everything.”
Lancaster added that some people also enjoy the flexibility academia offers.
“Some of them see having a position at the university as flexible, where they can also write books — like Madeleine Albright has done — or be involved with other boards of organizations or other kinds of things [because] it isn’t a nine to five job or a nine to eight job,” she said. “It gives the individual a lot of flexibility, and I think people coming out of high-profile positions often want that kind of flexibility.”
Other faculty members who have visible name recognition and come to Georgetown do not always have typical professorial responsibilities, however.
“A couple of years ago, we had the former president of Poland [Aleksander Kwasniewski] and the former prime minister of Spain [José Aznar] here, not teaching, but being available to do classes and activities and engage with students,” Lancaster said.
Some, like visiting professor and former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), are only able to spend a few years at Georgetown before moving on to their next occupation.
“Senator Hagel was obviously here and I think very happy here, according to what he’s told me, but, of course, the opportunity to reach for the position of Secretary of Defense has come along,” Lancaster said.
The notable figures also make concerted efforts to spend time with students.
Each semester, Albright holds a weekend-long diplomatic simulation, and Brazile makes sure to maintain her time commitment to her class.
“Last year, the presidential debate was held on one of the nights I taught, [so] I made it up by spending extra time on campus,” Brazile said.
And although politically well-known professors may belong to one party or another, they still support students no matter what their affiliation is.
“I write letters of recommendation for both Republicans and Democrats,” Brazile said.
“I have both Republicans and Democrats as [teaching assistants] and I’m proud of all of them.”

Although they have yet to issue a public statement, GUSA President Clara Gustafson and Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount are endorsing Jack Appelbaum and Maggie Cleary in the 2013 GUSA executive race, while GUSA Chief of Staff Jake Sticka is managing the ticket’s campaign.
Former Georgetown University Student Association President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) did not endorse a candidate in the 2012 GUSA race.
“As chief of staff over this past year, I’m obviously committed to this institution and concerned with its future,” Sticka (COL ’13) said. “I wanted to make sure the ticket I thought was best had the best chance of winning, and that’s why I’m supporting them.”
Ethan Chess (COL ’14), chair of the GUSA election committee, said there are no rules prohibiting active members of GUSA from endorsing or contributing to campaigns.
Gustafson (SFS ’13) praised the platforms and leadership style of Appelbaum (COL ’14) and Cleary (COL ’14) as “revolutionary.”
“If anyone is going to be able to get things done, it’s the two of them,” Gustafson said.
Sticka said he sees Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount’s support as an affirmation of Appelbaum and Cleary’s strength.
“I think it speaks for itself having the sitting exec’s support,” Sticka said.
Sticka cited his close work with Appelbaum as leaders of the College Democrats and in the currentGUSA executive cabinet as a major factor in his decision to support the ticket this year.
Appelbaum expressed his appreciation for Sticka’s support.
“It’s a great testament to the strengths of our ticket and experience on campus,” Appelbaum said.
Other candidates, however, questioned the significance of the executive’s endorsement.
“The most important thing is whoever takes over and continues the progress Clara and Vail have made — who they endorse is not the most important thing,” vice presidential candidate Robert Silverstein (SFS ’14) said.
“We’re disappointed that they chose to endorse Jack and Maggie’s campaign, but we respect their right to do so,” vice presidential candidate Joe Vandegriff (COL ’14) said.
Presidential candidate Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said he was surprised by Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount’schoice, and said that Sticka played a role in their decision to support Appelbaum and Cleary. Tisa has worked alongside the executive as speaker of the GUSA senate.
“While we respect the current execs, the one commonality between them and their ticket is JakeSticka,” Tisa said. “It’s been widely known that Sticka was going to manage their campaign and he was going to work his hardest to bring his partners on board.”
Tisa emphasized the similarities between his platform and Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount’s focus on social justice in the 2012 race.
“If you look at the tickets in the field of furthering social justice and diversity and bringing new voices into GUSA, that’s us,” Tisa said. “We are the ticket that truly does represent their legacy even if they’ve gone in a different direction.”
Gustafson expressed confidence in the student body’s interpretation of her endorsement.
“I hope Vail and I have done a good job by the students of Georgetown and I hope they know we want to make sure this new GUSA of openness and transparency is continued,” she said.
