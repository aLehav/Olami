Sociologist Jeb Sprague discussed his new book on paramilitary activity in Haiti at an event organized by the SFS Center for Latin American Studies in Intercultural Center Tuesday evening.
“The basic theme of my book is that throughout Haitian history there have been democratic steps moving forward, but continuously there have been pushbacks,” said Sprague, a PhD candidate at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
Sprague based his research on interviews with government officials from Haiti and the Dominican Republic and diplomatic cables that became available through WikiLeaks.
“I basically read all the WikiLeaks on Haiti from 2004 to 2010,” he said. “There is one U.S. cable I have that says ‘Well, we think the French might be funding these paramilitaries.’”
Paramilitaries — unofficially organized military forces — were established in Haiti after the United States helped dictator François Duvalier gain power in 1957. His police force, the Tonton Macoutes, carried out brutal attacks throughout the country.
“They became this pervasive force in Haitian society,” Sprague said.
Sprague said he was surprised by the amount of international support offered to the paramilitaries.
“The astonishing thing is that so many of the people I interviewed are so open about it, about being with the paramilitary,” Sprague said. “Another sector backing the paramilitary was the Dominican foreign ministry. There’s a whole group of people there who are clearly close with the paramilitaries.”
Sprague dedicated his presentation and book to Pierre Antoine Lovinsky, a Haitan human rights activist who was kidnapped from Haiti in August 2007.
Steeve Simbert (COL ’14), who left Haiti after the earthquake in 2010 and is now studying at Georgetown, was moved by Sprague’s presentation.
“I think that the Haitian people really have to get all the political games behind them and work together.”

Though Rangila is not until mid-November, practices are already underway for one of Georgetown’s largest student-run events.
The annual two-night performance, which showcases traditional South Asian dance along with other styles, is now in its third week of rehearsals. This year, over 600 dancers and 30 choreographers are involved in the show.
While dancers are still in the process of learning basic choreography, co-coordinators Neha Sobti (COL ’13) and Rohan Muralidhar (SFS ’13) have been planning this year’s Rangila since the summer. Major logistics, such as costume selection, have been nailed down with the help of the Georgetown University South Asian Society’s executive board, and the coordinators’ focus has shifted to the choreographers’ job of teaching their routines to hundreds of mostly inexperienced dancers.
“We call them the backbone because it’s their enthusiasm and creativity that really make a great show,” Sobti said about the choreographers, who were all appointed last spring.
In addition to South Asian culture, Rangila incorporates other dance styles, including salsa and contemporary hip-hop. This year the performance will feature a number from hip-hop group Groove Theory. Other dance groups on campus, including GU Irish Dancers and GU Dance Company, will also perform independently during the show.
Although organizing Rangila is extensive, coordinators say the benefits of the event far outweigh the work.
“It’s just a blend of great things,” Sobti said. “It’s [fundraising], getting to meet people, dancing and at the same time [showcasing] South Asian culture that a lot of people wouldn’t be exposed to.”
Rangila, which is now in its 17th year, has always been committed to donating all of its proceeds to charitable causes. In recent years, ticket sale revenues have been given to The Asha Kendra Hope Center, a non-profit career counseling, vocational training and educational resource center located in Jaipur, India. AKHC is exclusively funded by the GUSAS.
Rangila has also been a way for students with diverse interests to meet and work together.
“Rangila is unique because it is the one event that unifies all the kids on campus,” choreographer Sana Imam (COL ’15) said. “Every school, every race comes together for this event.”
Sonia Vora (SFS ’15), another choreographer, agreed with Imam.
“It’s one of the few things that people genuinely do just for fun. I think we have a lot of clubs that are good resume-builders, but Rangila … people just do it because it’s cool,” Vora said.
For Katelyn McNelis (SFS ’15), a Rangila rookie, last year’s performance left a lasting impression that motivated her to get involved.
“When I went last year, everyone radiated happiness,” she said.

Lannan Chair of Poetics Dinaw Mengestu (COL ’00) kicked off the Reading and Talk Series in the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice Tuesday.
Mengestu was a Lannan fellow as an undergraduate and has returned to campus multiple times since leaving Georgetown, including a stint as a writer-in-residence in 2007 that corresponded with the release of his debut novel “The Beautiful Things that Heaven Bears.” In 2011 he spoke to freshmen about his novel “How to Read the Air” for the annual Marino Family International Writers’ Academic Workshop.
Mengestu said he was honored to be back at Georgetown and looked forward to teaching “The Writer’s Perspective,” a literary seminar and creative writing workshop in the fall 2012 semester.
Born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Mengestu moved to Illinois in 1980. Most of his writing addresses the emotional transition and integration of African immigrants into American society, but he said he does not feel pressure to represent the Ethiopian community in his work.
“My characters reflect a history and culture that is mine, but more importantly, they are human beings,” he said. “They portray the loneliness of immigrants, the loneliness of an everyday man struggling to bear and love life in all its complexity.”
During the seminar, Mengestu discussed how his particular history and identity influenced his development as a writer.
“I basically had to write myself into existence,” he said. “My perspective is uniquely mine — the absence of an Ethiopian community during my childhood, the resistance to becoming an American citizen during my teenage years, the racism I encountered growing up — and I have the authority to create something out of that.”
Mengestu explained the faith required to impress readers.
“As a writer, you find the music and equilibrium of a sentence, then a paragraph, and you take a tremendous leap of faith, which is hoping that readers will invest themselves in your text.”
Maria-Jose Navia, a doctoral candidate in the Spanish and Portuguese department, attended the seminar after reading Mengestu’s second novel, “How to Read the Air.”
“I finished the entire book in one night,” she said. “It was incredible, and I just had to hear him speak in person.”

Princeton University professor Jack Tannous presented an unconventional view of Muslim-Christian hybridity to a group students and professors Wednesday evening.
As the first lecturer in the fall 2012 Islamic Studies Lecture Series “From Late Antiquity to Early Islam,” Tannous informed and surprised his audience with his presentation titled “What Difference Did Islam Make? Christians, Muslims, and the End of the Ancient World.”
Tannous said the goal of his lecture was to address the religious transition from Christianity to Islam in the early Middle East and demonstrate the impact Christianity has made on Islam.
“In the 630s and 640s, Arabs swept over what is now the Middle East, and now the overwhelming majority of the Middle East is clearly Arabic. However, what we need to ask ourselves is, ‘How did this massive transformation happen?’” Tannous said.
For 500 years, the majority of people in the Middle East were Christian. With this in mind, Tannous suggested that many of the early Muslims of the region were actually Christian converts, a view that he said has upset many historians and theologians over the course of his study.
“Christian and Muslim interaction was initially on a non-elite level,” Tannous said. “Most of these early converts were not sophisticated theologians.”
Tannous pointed to symbols of Christianity in early Muslim populations and in Greek works written in Syriac as evidence for his ideas. Tannous used the example of Muslim people baking bread with crosses inscribed on top.
“Muslims were holding on to so many Christian ritual symbols, like the Eucharist, cross, Baptism or Jesus and the holy saints,” Tannous said. “It is like moving to a new apartment and keeping your old furniture.”
Tannous’ ideas were new for many in the audience.
“I wouldn’t have expected Christianity to make such a huge impact on Islam,” Arienne Calingo (COL ’14) said. “I think it is good that he keeps an open mind and doesn’t just focus on what the elites think.”

Now in his sixth week as Georgetown’s provost, former Director of the U.S. Census Bureau Robert Groves sat down with The Hoya to discuss his hopes for the university and goals for the year.
What are your aims for this academic year?
They are derivative of larger university goals. My job is to worry about the quality of faculty and academic programs. … I have to worry about the education [the students] are getting, recruiting good faculty and making sure the programs are up-to-date and high quality. A lot of the goals are keeping that going, making sure that program reviews are going on and that we are getting outside critiques of how well we are doing. I also make sure that we have rigorous reviews of … the faculty, especially for tenure decisions, which are very important decisions that we worry about. … I want to make sure we keep doing as well as we have been doing. The other goals are longer-term ones that I won’t finish in a year. … [The long-term goals] have to do with making sure that the way we educate both undergraduate and graduate students utilizes the best methods we can. Many universities, including Georgetown, are deliberating on how we can use new technologies in the classroom to make it faster for [students] to learn things, give [them] more time with faculty for intense interactions.
Why did you choose to become Georgetown’s provost after your time organizing the 2010 Census?
I am an academic at heart. I’ve taught at the University of Michigan, started mainly graduate programs and done research for a long time … and then I had this stint as a presidential appointment in the Obama administration … so going back to a campus was just a natural thing for me. I realized I missed being around students deeply. It is something that I learned about myself more from being away from them than being with them. I wanted to get back to campus.
Georgetown is special on a variety of dimensions that make it an important attraction. One is, I have a firm belief that the next few years at a university are going to be the most exciting years in my life. There are massive changes going on in the world that universities have to adapt to. They can’t be ignored. How Georgetown will look 20 years from now, I think, will really be shaped over the next few years. … It really is a matter of a small number of years that will seal the future of Georgetown, and … I want to be involved.
I really believe that the undergraduate and graduate student experience has to be a much more original discovery of knowledge and research-based, because we are all going to be researchers. We won’t call ourselves researchers, but that is how we are going to live our [lives] in the future. This involves an integration of the academic side and the teaching side and the research side of universities. This has sometimes been confused as [conflicting], but I view these as different parts of the same beast. And then how we have to adapt new technologies to the new pedagogy. I wanted to be a part of that, and if you think of both those things, Georgetown has been involved in a discussion about them. Here was an institution that seemed ready … to move on them, and that’s very exciting to me.
What do you see as your role in Georgetown’s long-term future?
Georgetown is ready to be a much more prominent research university. It has a lot of the ingredients for this, so one of my jobs has to be to find out what the structure and the appointment process and the administrative procedures that will facilitate world-class research. So that’s clearly a front-burner issue for this office. We have to get this right, and there is work to be done on it. And then the second thing is related to that. Part of the answers to this will force us to talk about the next round of undergraduate and graduate programs as well. … These are big things that will end up determining what the Georgetown of 20 years from now will look like. Most of my thoughts are on that.
What inspired you to start a blog? What is the blog’s purpose?
The blog is really for me to float ideas and to address an issue of what’s going on on campus: What [is the administration] talking about? What are they planning? I want it to be a way to make things more transparent, and I want it to be a dialogue. We will start, soon, a dialogue about the use of technology in classrooms, and I want students and faculty to be a part of that dialogue. I’ll use the blog to remind people about how they can participate.
How will you respond to student feedback on your blog?
What I’m looking for are ones that start expanding the point, especially ones that are controversial. … Usually when that happens, there is something worth thinking about. If people are having divergent viewpoints, that is really important for me to know. My hunch is rather than jumping into the comment stream … I may do another blog that’s stimulated by the stream of comments. I don’t want to squelch any of the commentary. … I don’t want to be the arbiter of the comments.

Getting home for the holidays may become progressively more challenging for students as Reagan National Airport struggles to cope with increased traffic.
The airport, located between the Potomac River and Arlington County just over five miles from campus, has long been a destination airport for travelers coming into D.C. The convenience of its relatively urban location also means that, unlike more spacious suburban airports such as Dulles Airport, Reagan was never designed to be a major airline hub because of space constraints.
However, that is exactly what Reagan has become. In 2011, 18.8 million airline passengers passed through Reagan, a 22 percent increase over the 15.4 million seen in 2002. This increase has been felt most severely in security lines, baggage claim areas and bottlenecks that develop for connecting flights, according to Rob Yingling, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.
Yingling said that the airport has faced increased strain in recent years because Congress can use legislation to mandate that it accept additional flights. Most recently, Congress voted to pass the FAA Modernization and Reform Act dated Feb. 1, 2012, which ordered the airport to accept 16 more flights within 90 days in an effort to increase competition and travel options for passengers.
“We do our best to accommodate the new flights, but our main concern is that Reagan National is running out of room to grow,” Yingling said.
Nonetheless, Yingling said that the authority has planned changes to alleviate traffic, including the addition of security-screening lanes at two new checkpoints, a new outbound baggage building for Terminal A and the creation of 1,400 new parking spaces.
While these solutions address immediate concerns, the airport will eventually have to contend with larger issues — the foremost being that it lacks the necessary space to expand.
Yingling said that future plans for the airport may include revamping parking facilities, creating new passenger corridors or replacing a terminal.

While annual international undergraduate application totals have grown significantly since the turn of the millennium, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions intends to keep the proportion of international students on campus stable going forward.
International students, who comprise 9 percent of the undergraduate population at Georgetown, have applied to the university in rising numbers in recent years, according to Dean of Admissions Charles Deacon. The university received close to 2,200 international applications for the Class of 2016, compared to about 600 such applications for the Class of 2004.
According to Deacon, the admissions office has sent admissions officers abroad to inform prospective students about Georgetown since the early 1980s.
“Georgetown’s goal has always been to be representative internationally, so an international student population of 7 to 10 percent is the range that we hope to have every year. But within that range, we hope to have our students coming from a fairly wide distribution of countries,” Deacon said. The Class of 2016 includes students from 47 foreign countries, though no more than 20 students hail from each individual nation.
Georgetown admissions officers work with admissions departments at Harvard University, Stanford University, Duke University and the University of Pennsylvania in the Exploring College Options Group, which travels abroad to provide information sessions for parents and students across the world.
Senior Associate Director of Undergraduate Admissions Jaime Briseño is responsible for recruiting students from Latin America and the Caribbean as well as much of southern California, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Briseño said that traveling with other well-known schools allows Georgetown to present itself to high school students who may not have heard of the university.
“The program really increases our visibility for areas that may have heard primarily of Harvard or Stanford. When students abroad consider American colleges, they tend to go by the most known name,” he said. “They are able to learn about Georgetown and walk away knowing why it might be a great fit.”
According to Deacon, admissions officers advertise Georgetown for its location, Jesuit values and global perspective.
Briseño added that while Georgetown’s Catholic values are appealing to much of the Latin American market, traveling with other universities gives Georgetown access to a wider variety of students who consider Georgetown for reasons other than its religious affiliation.
“[I hope] that students gain a better understanding of how broad the Georgetown population is as a Catholic school … so that they realize that although we are very much a Catholic Jesuit school, we actually appeal to a large proportion of non-Catholics and are supportive of everyone,” Briseño said.
Georgetown’s alumni network also helps draw international applicants. Former Filipino president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo attended Georgetown, so the school is well known in the Philippines, according to Filipino student Randy Puno (COL ’16).
“There is a solid alumni class back home, so I’ve considered Georgetown as a possibility my entire life,” Puno said.
But according to Briseño, Georgetown’s limited financial aid budget for foreign students limits the number of international students who can attend.
“The challenge isn’t as much market penetration in some foreign cities but rather the limited budget that the university has for foreign students,” he said. “It would be great if the financial aid office had a greater budget, because it would allow us to reach out to more middle-class students from across theworld.”
However, Deacon emphasized that his office has no intention of increasing the proportion of international students on the Hilltop.
“We are happy to have international students, we get a very talented pool, we get a very representative group from all around the world, but we also feel the responsibility to U.S. citizens,” he said.

After a failed university web server delayed the release of ballots by more than nine hours, voting for GUSA senators and the evidentiary standard referendum was still underway at press time early Friday morning.
According to Georgetown University Student Association Election Commissioner Ethan Chess (COL ’14), 2,509 students had voted as of 12:30 a.m. Friday, exceeding the 2,000 votes needed to make the referendum valid.
This election’s turnout is the one of the largest GUSA has seen on any student body-wide referendum, surpassing the record 2,463 students who voted on the Student Activities and Fee Endowment reform proposals last spring.
“We’re extremely pleased with the turnout,” Chess said.
Chess also expressed satisfaction with the successful use of HoyaLink to host the elections. This is the first time that the website, which was established at the start of last semester, has been used for aGUSA vote.
“It’s really quite advanced software that allows us to be 100 percent clear that every vote comes from the right person in the right district,” Chess said, explaining that HoyaLink pulls up the correct ballot for each student based on his or her NetID.
“I think this is going to set the future of GUSA elections on a new and better course,” he said.
Because of the delayed release of the ballot, polls will stay open until noon Friday.
An email containing a link to the ballot for the election and referendum was originally scheduled to be delivered to the student body by 10 p.m. Wednesday night, but one of Georgetown’s primary domain name system servers failed Wednesday afternoon, preventing the election commission from sending the email until 7:30 a.m. Thursday.
According to Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis, the server failure also caused a few thousand messages sent by outside addresses between 3:45 p.m. and 5:05 p.m. Wednesday to be returned to their senders or delayed.
Despite the postponement, GUSA Senate Transition Chair Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said he does not believe the final result of the voting will be impacted.
“It’s unfortunate, but ultimately it doesn’t matter because this is an issue that students care enough to vote no matter what,” he said.
The referendum allows student to vote “yes” or “no” as to whether they support changing the Code of Student Conduct’s evidentiary standard from “more likely than not” to “clear and convincing” in all cases other than sexual assault.
However, the referendum has no legislative authority to alter the Code of Student Conduct.
In order for the change to be implemented, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson must approve the proposal, but Olson has said that he will not make his decision until representatives from Loyola University of Chicago and Duke University conclude their external review of the Office of Student Conduct on Friday.
GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13), GUSA Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), the co-directors of the Student Advocacy Office and several resident assistants met with the external reviewers Thursday.
“[The reviewers] seemed to be very understanding of the challenges the students face in interacting with the code of conduct. …We talked a lot about personal experiences and how the system can be reformed to be more educational to the students,” Kohnert-Yount said.
Though the referendum does not have the power to modify the evidentiary standard, Gustafson said it is part of GUSA’s effort to show student support for the change.
“The more votes we get, the more clear and convincing the message that it sends to the university administration,” she said.
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the 2,509 students who voted in this election represented the largest turnout seen by any student body-wide referendum. A referendum in 2008 actually received more. The corrected version was posted at 11:45 a.m. Sept. 28.

Georgetown’s Bias Reporting System was updated this month for the first time since August 2010 and now includes statistics through spring 2012.
In April The Hoya reported the then-20-month inactivity of the website, the maintenance of which is the responsibility of the bias reporting team, which is composed of representatives from the Office of Student Affairs, the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action and the Department of Public Safety.
According to the updated reports on the site, 49 incidents have been reported since August 2010 — 16 in fall 2010, six in spring 2011, one in June 2011, 14 in fall 2011 and 12 in spring 2012.
Director of the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access and Associate Dean of Students Dennis Williams, who serves as chair of the bias reporting team, said that the long drought was due to Georgetown’s outdated information technology systems and the lack of a point person responsible for making updates to the website.
“The website was basically created in somebody’s garage … so a lot of things became obsolete or didn’t make it,” Williams said. “We are in the process of updating the system … and filling a position and a part of that person’s job would be to periodically update the system.”
A new staff member in the Office of Student Affairs has been appointed to maintain the website, according to Williams, though he declined to name the individual.
The system was created in 2004 by the bias reporting team to address intolerance on campus, and a total of 181 reports have since been filed.
Before the implementation of the website, bias-related incidents often went unreported.
“You could look at [the university’s reported] crime statistics and say, ‘Oh, there are no hate crimes,’” Williams said.
Since fall 2004, the website has listed statistical breakdowns of incidents reported on campus each semester. The site also began including month-by-month breakdowns starting in September 2007. Cases are categorized by type of alleged bias, and reports give a brief description of the nature of the incident. Unlike the Department of Public Safety’s crime logs, no information is given about the location of or the response to incidents.
About 12 to 15 cases are typically reported each semester, though incidents spiked in the spring and summer of 2009, when 25 incidents were reported.
Williams said that even in the absence of updates between August 2010 and this month, the incident reporting system remained intact.
“People have been making reports,” Williams said. “Someone follows up with the person filing the report and makes sure that that person is OK, [checks] if there is anything that person needs in the way of resources and advises that person of any possibilities of recourse.”
Georgetown University Student Association President and Vice President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13)and Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) said that their administration hopes to publicize the system more aggressively this semester.
“It’s important that the university community follows up on these results, both in response to individual incidents and to address the larger problems within Georgetown’s culture that give rise to bias and harassment,” Kohnert-Yount said. “There is still a lot of work to be done to publicize the BRS to the Georgetown community, as many students don’t know that it even exists.”
Part of their effort includes adding the system and an emergency phone number for victims of sexual assault to Georgetown’s mobile application, which was unveiled at the beginning of the school year. According to Gustafson, this information will be added in the coming weeks.
Gustafson also emphasized the need to educate the student body on the meaning of bias and said that she and Kohnert-Yount would like to address the root causes of these incidents.
“We have to educate the student body on what bias is. Some students don’t know that; they don’t know what bias is even if they see it,” Gustafson said.
She added that the bias reporting team has been working with the Office of Residence Life to teach resident assistants about the system.
“RAs are, by far, the people who use the system the most,” Gustafson said. “We’ve had a few meetings with [the Office of Residence Life] to talk about how they do their trainings and how we can replicate some of their best practices on a campus level.”

In an attempt to offset what they perceive to be an “old boys’ club” mentality on campus, members of the Women Advancing Gender Equity Fellowship hope to focus campus attention on gender issues.
Led by Women’s Center director Laura Kovach, WAGE consists of female leaders who advocate for the empowerment of women in the Georgetown community.
The 10 founding members established WAGE in 2008 after recognizing an unequal correlation between gender and the opportunities at Georgetown.
“The founding members felt that there was an ‘old boys’ ’ network at Georgetown and that some of the male leaders on campus had close connections with the Jesuits and would be invited to the Jesuit residence,” Brittanie Leibold (COL ’13), a second-year WAGE fellow and undergraduate assistant at the Women’s Center, said. “Women leaders weren’t allowed those same opportunities. WAGE just wanted to create a space for that.”
Since its founding, WAGE has seen an annual increase in applicants and now includes 15 fellows, nine of whom are new this semester. Students can apply for the fellowship in their sophomore and junior years.
“The reason I looked to WAGE was because I was involved in women’s issues off campus, but there weren’t really places to have those discussions on campus. And that was odd to me,” Sophia Boyer (COL ’14), a new WAGE fellow, said.
The group currently meets in the Women’s Center for one hour a week to listen to female speakers, read newspaper articles and discuss gender issues.
“We talk about everything related to gender,” Leibold said.
WAGE emphasizes the importance of fostering strong female leaders on campus.
Boyer has not always considered herself a women’s leader.
“The conversations [of gender] weren’t on my mind, which ­I think is problematic,” Boyer said. “I don’t know why I wasn’t conscious of myself being a woman leader, but that was the environment [at Georgetown].”
WAGE matches new fellows with mentors — alumni who can offer both professional and personal advice about transitioning into the working world.
Leibold said she looks up to former WAGE Fellow Soraya Chemaly (COL ’88), a feminism and gender writer for the The Huffington Post.
“[Chemaly] talked about the need for women to support each other and not look at each other as competition — the ‘cat-fight’ mentality,” Leibold said, citing the statistic that one woman has a position of power for every 10 male leaders. “If there were more than one token woman at the top, we would be pulling each other up rather than making it a competition.”
WAGE emphasizes the importance of establishing an alliance between men and women. The group holds an annual Women’s Leadership Panel, which invites all members of the community to join the gender discussion.
“Last year we even had [Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J.] up there with three women,” Leibold said.
With O’Brien’s addition to the panel, WAGE seemed to have breeched the “old boys” barrier of previous years
“I enthusiastically support the Women’s Center as Laura Kovach and her team cultivate women for leadership on our campus and beyond,” O’Brien wrote in an email. “[The Jesuits] are proud of the many ways that women from different faith traditions lead our ministries.”
However, WAGE Fellow Melissa McClure (COL ’13) said she still notices a gender barrier when she attempts to start conversations with her classmates.
“I was in International Law and asked, since [the professor] was on the panel, if I could make an announcement,” McClure wrote in an email.  “The moment I said ‘women’ in ‘Annual Women’s Leadership Forum’ every guy who had been watching me turned their heads as if it did not apply to them. I was incredibly frustrated and said, ‘For all you guys who just put your heads down, try to take an interest in the other half of the population.’”
WAGE hopes that the recent growth in applicants and future events will increase student awareness of gender issues on campus.
“I think the more that other groups can bring multiple interests to one table and have in common, [the more] they care about women’s leadership. … It will benefit WAGE,” Boyer said.

For many professors, achieving tenure is the holy grail of an academic career. But it is not an easy position to obtain — or to grant.
Unlike associate or adjunct professors, who must normally renew contracts on a yearly basis, tenure-track professors are granted a seven-year probationary contract, after which they are brought under review for a tenure position — one that guarantees job security and the ability to focus their research on a particular field. Tenure candidates undergo three levels of review, starting with their departments and then the specific school they teach in before making their case to the University Committee on Rank and Tenure.
Despite the intensity of the process, administrators acknowledge that the exact requirements for granting tenure can be unclear.
“People don’t know what is expected of them or what the tenure process will entail,” said Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J., chair of the theology department. “There’s no way to say, ‘Yes, this will definitely get you tenure.’”
As with anything so potentially life altering, there is concern about whether the tenure determination process is sufficiently transparent and fair. According to a Sept. 17 article in The GW Hatchet, professors at The George Washington University have expressed concern that the guidelines for gaining tenure are not appropriately fair. Professors at the school said that miscommunication or a disagreement with a dean could prevent faculty from securing lifelong positions, according to The Hatchet.
But academic administrators at Georgetown say that every effort is made to ensure the guidelines are laid out clearly and that the process is as fair as possible.
“I am sure that any process where someone’s life is at stake makes people extremely nervous, and that can give rise to feelings that it’s unpredictable,” said Alexander Sens, former chair of the University Committee on Rank and Tenure. “But that’s really not the case.”
The committee comprises delegates from Georgetown College, the School of Foreign Service and the McDonough School of Business as well as from the Georgetown University Law Center and the Georgetown University School of Medicine. Half of the committee members are appointed by the Office of the President, and the rest are appointed by the faculty senate.
According to Steck, this common review process ensures an even playing field.
“I can see how there would be concern if one department has higher standards than another,” he said. “Ultimately, though, the [final] decision is made by the same committee.”
SFS Faculty Chair David Edelstein, who has served on the tenure review committee for the SFS, added that the process is similar at each phase of review. He said that tenure is determined at all levels on the basis of three main pillars — service, teaching and research — though it is difficult to pinpoint how those three factors are weighted.
“We value teaching, so it’s important that you’re a good teacher. It’s also important that you’re a good scholar and researcher,” Edelstein said. “There’s no single formula for weighing those things.”
Nonetheless, Sens said that clear information about expectations and frequent meetings between senior university academics and those on the tenure track ensures that those who wish to attain tenure generally do.
“I think we set expectations reasonably, and if you meet those expectations, then you should have a pretty good [chance] … that you’ll get tenure.”

The first elected female president of Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, spoke about Argentina’s bilateral relationship with the United States and her administration’s economic policies in Copley Formal Lounge Wednesday.
Her speech marked the inauguration of “Catédra Argentina,” a new Georgetown lecture series that includes lectures and conferences on Argentina by representatives from Argentina and the U.S.
“Our government has been pushing forward a reindustrialization model, betting on the domestic market,” Kirchner said. “This is a huge move forward from the collapse that happened in 2001 when we were running a debt over 160 percent of the GDP.”
Dismissing notions of an antagonistic relationship between Argentina and the International Monetary Fund, Kirchner argued that the country has paid off its debt to the organization, and in return, the country now has full autonomy over its economic policies.
According to Kirchner, Argentina has paid back $25 out of every $100 lent to the country after it defaulted in 2001.
“We restructured our debt in 2005 and now have corrected nearly 94 percent,” she said. “That said, we still have no access to capital markets so everything is being paid without access to those markets.”
Kirchner also pointed out Argentina’s social reconstruction, including investments in education, science and technology.
Nearly 900 scientists who left the country after the 2001 collapse have returned because of an increase in resource allotment in those fields, and according to Kirchner, Argentina has the highest number of software experts in South America.
Her speech also focused on employment improvements.
“We have created over 5.5 million jobs, and we have also succeeded in making our workers have wages that are the best in all of Latin America,” she said.
Concluding on an optimistic note, Kirchner assured the audience that today’s Argentina is a different, more stable country than the one that existed 10 years ago.
“We will continue to advance,” she said. “We will continue to recover things in our country and work with all of our Latin American compatriots to do so in our region as well.”

Under Secretary of Education Martha Kanter discussed the future of federal financial aid Thursday in Intercultural Center.
Kanter, who was appointed by President Obama in April 2009 after serving as chancellor of the Foothill-De Anza Community College District, described the U.S. Department of Education’s mission as bipartisan.
“Whatever administration is in or out of office, our responsibility is to educate as many students as we can to the best of our ability,” she said.
According to Kanter, the department aims to increase the country’s proportion of college graduates.
“We had that a generation ago, and we lost that in a generation,” she said of the fact that the United States no longer produces the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. “We need a huge sea change across the entire spectrum.”
The department’s agenda includes doubling work-study funding, increasing the number of Pell Grants — federal grants offered to undergraduate students — and providing incentives for graduates to go into the public service sector.
“Our president said, ‘It’s an economic imperative.’… College affordability is fundamental to the future of society,” she said.
Acting Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education David Bergeron joined Kanter on stage for a question-and-answer segment.
When asked about the possibility for bilingual education programs, Bergeron was optimistic. “One of the things we have to recognize is that for us to be globally competitive we need to be global,” he said.
Kanter also emphasized the need for adapting national education policies to a modern world.
“One size doesn’t fit all. … I am for what works. I am not for these old models of a certain kind of curriculum that might seem good but is failing kids,” she said. “My dream is that every student in the country would learn more than one language early.”
Both speakers emphasized the importance of protecting the Pell Grant program and providing support for teachers in the public school system.
“Forty years ago [the Pell Grant] paid for all, or at least two-thirds, of a four-year education. … It’s now paying for less than a third at places like Georgetown as costs continue to rise,” Kanter said. “Is education a take it or leave it thing?”
Kanter also talked about the need to reduce student debt.
“Debt is something we’ve got to tackle in a very systemic way,” she said. “We don’t want Americans taking out any more loans they can’t pay back.”
Students said they had a more positive outlook on the American higher education system after the event.
“I thought it was very uplifting,” Dylan Gaffney (COL ’15) said. “[Kanter] was very optimistic, looking towards the future.”

The evidentiary standard referendum initiated by the GUSA senate was passed in a study body-wide referendum Friday.
The referendum received a total of 2,629 votes, with 96 percent of students voting “yes” in support of changing the Code of Student Conduct’s evidentiary standard from “more likely than not” to “clear and convincing.”
Voting on the referendum opened Thursday morning and closed at noon Friday after being delayed nearly 10 hours due to the failure of one of the university’s domain name system servers. The GUSA Election Commission released the final results shortly after the polls closed.
All student body-wide referendums are required to reach a 2,000-vote minimum to be considered valid. This referendum received enough votes to cross the threshold by early evening on Thursday and garnered 2,629 votes by the time polls closed.
This election’s turnout surpassed the 2,463 students who voted on the Student Activities and Fee Endowment reform proposals last spring. The SAFE proposal referendum, however, was open for three days of voting while the evidentiary standard referendum was only open for a little more than a day.
GUSA President Clara Gustasfson (SFS’13) expressed excitement over the number of students who supported the change.
“I am very excited to see the referendum passed with such an incredible percentage. It definitely shows a huge interest from the student body on this issue,” Gustafson said.
Gustafson and GUSA Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS’13) will present and discuss the results at a meeting with Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson, who has the final call on whether or not to  approve the evidentiary standard change to the Code of Student Conduct.
“Hopefully we can use this to leverage to get a favorable decision from the university,” Gustafson said.

The International Brotherhood of Electrical Works Local 1900 union voted to reject electricity supplierPepco’s final contract offer Wednesday night, making a city-wide strike an increasingly likely possibility.
According to The Washington Post, union members rejected the offer by a five-to-one ratio, with over 1,000 members turning out to vote. The union represents about 1,150 Pepco workers.
“While Pepco has described their offer as ‘generous,’ we call it ridiculous, and we think when [the workers] see the offer, [they] will agree with [the union] negotiating committee that this offer should be a lot better,” IBEW President Jim Griffin said in a message to union members the day of the vote.
But Pepco Regional Communications Director Myra Oppel said that the company’s offer was more than fair.
“We feel it is attractive and mirrors our approach with managing employees,” Oppel said. “It has pay increases, hires more union workers and continues an excellent pension plan. We feel that it is fair and reasonable by any standard.”
IBEW and Pepco are resuming negotiations Friday in hopes of reaching an agreement. In the meantime, the existing contract will remain in effect until either party decides to terminate it, though the last extension expired Sept. 16.
If an accord cannot be achieved, the union’s next step could be to vote to authorize a strike. If the motion passed, IBEW would have to give Pepco 48 hours’ notice before formally going on strike.
No matter the outcome, Pepco has made prior arrangements to prepare for such a possibility.
“If they did decide that they wanted to go out on strike, we are fully prepared for as long as the strike may or may not go on. For the last several months, we have trained employees … who would help maintain the system,” Oppel said. “We also have contractors who are already here working on our system who would be available to assist in any outages. If there were any extended outages, we would use our normal process of requesting mutual assistance.”
Although Pepco is the university’s primary electricity supplier, the university does not expect any disruptions in power supply in the event of a power outage.
“In the event of a power outage and delayed response time from Pepco, Georgetown has systems in place to keep operations running and minimize the impact,” said Rachel Pugh, director of media relations.
