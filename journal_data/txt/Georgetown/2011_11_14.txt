Academic advisors and students anticipate minor adjustments in the premedical program in response to changes to the Medical College Admissions Test, which will take effect in 2015.
The exam, which is a major part of the admissions process for medical schools, will be two hours longer and test a broader range of material after the revisions are implemented.
Assistant Dean and Director of Pre-Health Programs Ed Meyertholen said that because the specific MCAT changes were only recently announced, it is hard to predict their effects on the roughly 100 students who enter Georgetown’s pre-medical program every year.
“I think the test is really designed to find out exactly what the students learned during their time as undergraduates,” Meyertholen said. “How [the changes] are going to affect how we recommend, I don’t really know yet.”
The Association of American Medical Colleges, which administers the MCAT, concluded its initial deliberations early this month and recently released a preliminary guide to expected changes, listing three major modifications.
Two new sections, “Psychological, Social and Biological Foundations of Behavior” and “Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills,” will be added to the exam. These will supplement the biological and physical science portions of the test, which the AAMC is updating to reflect medical knowledge and technique.
The additional content will extend the length of the exam from four and a quarter to six and a quarter hours, excluding arrival and break time.
According to the committee that drew up the new test, these changes will ensure that students remain up-to-date on innovations in the field.
“The recommended changes preserve what works about the current MCAT exam, eliminate what isn’t working and enrich the exam by giving attention to the concepts tomorrow’s doctors will need,” the group wrote in the preview.
Armon Ayandeh (COL ’12), former president and current Senior Advisory Board member of the Pre-Medical Society, predicted that the changes will reduce academic flexibility for students in the pre-med track.
“The Georgetown advisors are now going to need to emphasize the need for students to also take sociology and psychology courses to be prepared for the new section of the MCAT,” he wrote in an email. “I think that students will likely worry about these upcoming changes, as they put more stress on students by requiring additional course work and reducing the opportunity for students to take interesting electives.”
Meyertholen said that the MCAT modifications will spur minor changes in the program’s course requirements.
“Its going to require a little bit more [psychology] or [sociology],” he said of students’ course selections. “They’re just going to look a little bit more in those areas than they had before.”
Though Ayandeh agreed that updating the test is necessary, he also expressed concern about the extension of the test’s completion time.
“I think that [an almost] seven-hour test is simply too long, as it is already difficult enough to maintain a high level of concentration and critical thinking for [the current length of the exam],” he wrote.
But Meyertholen expressed confidence in Georgetown students’ abilities to adapt to the new MCAT.
“[The change] really doesn’t matter,” he said. “Pre-med [students] seem to be the type to do whatever is necessary to succeed.”

D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray spoke about the importance of fostering entrepreneurship in the District at the kickoff of the annual Global Entrepreneurship Week Monday evening.
“The ultimate goal is for Georgetown to be known for its entrepreneurial culture, to be a place that encourages entrepreneurship, where students and faculty come together to solve problems,” Jeff Reid, the moderator of the panel, said in his opening statement. Reid is also director of entrepreneurship and real estate finance initiatives for the McDonough School of Business.
Gordon Brown, former British prime minister, and Carl Schramm, president and chief executive officer of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, launched the Global Entrepreneurship Week in 2008. It is now an annual event that focuses on promoting the future of innovation in America and involves more than 10 million people from over 120 countries around the world.
This year marks the third time Georgetown has held the event.
The kickoff began with a discussion featuring three entrepreneurs. The session was preceeded by a welcome by MSB Dean David Thomas and followed by Gray’s address and closing remarks from Schramm.
Gray, a native Washingtonian, focused on the future of technological entrepreneurship within the District.
Gray’s administration, which has now been in office for 10 months, has said that fostering business growth is at the top of its to-do list.
“We like to think that we have sent the message that Washington, D.C. is one of the best places to start a business,” Gray said.
He highlighted specific areas of the city that are thriving economically.
“One only needs to go to Dupont Circle, Columbia Heights or H Street,” he said. “Forty years ago, everyone had given up on H Street, the neighborhood I actually grew up in. Now, if you go there, you will see a thriving area of the city that was recently voted the number one main street in America.”
For Gray, the event represented the greater business efforts of the city.
“To be here, as part of an effort like this, is reinforcing where we hope to go as a city. The District of Columbia is officially open for business,” he said.
Gray also pointed to an educated workforce as indicative of the District’s economic success.
“Seventy-one percent of the people who live in D.C. have some form of college education. I don’t think there is any other city in the nation that can boast those kinds of numbers,” he said.
Georgetown students in attendance were encouraged by a variety of the speakers to take innovative risks.
“As Georgetown students, who are constantly thinking of new ideas, it was great hearing the mayor reassure us that in fact we are creating jobs and we are moving forward,” Pierre Lapeyre (MSB ’15) said.
Multiple speakers emphasized the importance of entrepreneurship as a remedy for to the stagnant economy.
“I truly believe that entrepreneurship must be a part of the solution set that moves us out of the current economic situation we are in.” Thomas said.

Major players in the debate surrounding Georgetown’s 2010 Campus Plan are gearing up to make final arguments before the D.C. Zoning Commission at its fifth and final hearing on the plan Thursday night.
The plan, which outlines the university’s goals for expansion over the next 10 years, has been the focal point of Georgetown’s relationship with its neighbors since it was filed last December.
After the District Department of Transportation gives its testimony at this week’s hearing, the commission will take several months to make its final ruling.
Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) said the organization aims to send a contingent of 40 students to the hearing to back the plan.
“Students are excited to go down there and show D.C. officials and neighbors that we’re standing with the university and we don’t appreciate not being treated like full citizens of D.C.,” he said.
The students’ testimony will supplement an online petition emailed to students, faculty, staff and alumni by University President John J. DeGioia Nov. 3, urging them to sign their names in support of the university.
The petition outlines the positive impact that the school has on the District, citing students’ volunteer efforts in the community and the university’s ment of more than 3,200 D.C. residents.
According to university spokesperson Stacy Kerr, about 4,100 people have signed the online petition so far. More than 3,000 signatures were received within the first 24 hours of its distribution.
“We’re very pleased by the overwhelming response we’ve received in such a short time,” she said.
Kerr added that the university also distributed a pamphlet to households in the 20007 zip code Monday, outlining its commitment to quality of life in the community.
Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Chairman Ron Lewis declined to comment on neighbors’ plans for Thursday, adding that he will reserve all comments for the hearing.
The websites of both the Citizens Association of Georgetown and the Burleith Citizens Association prominently display information about the next hearing and how to give testimony against the Campus Plan.
In an ANC report released last week, neighbors expressed lingering concerns about the university’s impact on the community.
“The overwhelming objectionable impact … is that it would keep in place a very large number of off-campus transient student group houses and all the problems they bring,” the report reads.
Authors of the report also wrote that Georgetown’s off-campus disciplinary policies are more lax than on-campus policies, contributing to noise and student trash in the neighborhood.
“On the subject of university codes of conduct and disciplinary practices, we the community and the Zoning Commission are essentially stuck with what GU offers us,” they wrote.
Neighbors first began formally expressing their opposition on Jan. 20, when the ANC held a public meeting regarding the plan.
“[Students] cannot follow basic rules of living,” ANC Commissioner Tom Birch said at the hearing.
Since the plan was submitted it has been modified several times in response to neighborhood concerns. Major changes include the addition of 250 on-campus beds, a freeze on undergraduate enrollment and a modified transportation plan that would run Georgetown University Transportation Shuttles past Harbin Hall instead of installing a loop road behind Yates Field House and McDonough Arena.
The enrollment freeze and the 250 additional on-campus beds were added to the plan at the end of March, as the university prepared for the first Zoning Commission hearing April 14.
“The goal [of the plan] is to reaffirm Georgetown’s commitment to partnership,” DeGioia said in his testimony at that hearing. “[The] Campus Plan is a modest and responsible plan for the university’s future with substantial commitments that respond to community and city concerns.”
The issues first brought up at the ANC meeting have continued to monopolize debate at more recent hearings.
“As long as the number of students being housed on campus is less than 100 percent, it frees far too many undergraduates to live off campus in the surrounding community,” Lewis said at the commission’s third hearing May 19. “The zoning rules provide the tools to repair this situation, and the time to do this is now.”
Though the commission had planned to make its decision after the May 19 hearing, it was forced to schedule two additional hearings to accommodate the large number of students and neighbors who wanted to give testimony and to allow DDOT extra time to review the transportation components of the plan.
This semester, Georgetown has rolled out several policies aimed at improving neighbors’ opinions of the plan.
The measures include a university-funded neighborhood trashcollection program, the implementation of the M Street shuttle on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights and the installation of additional Metropolitan Police Department officers around campus.
Opponents of the plan remain skeptical about the initiatives.
“The university is obviously doing what it is doing now with an eye on its proposed 10-year campus plan. It is implementing a few measures that do not work … and also strongly initiating PR efforts,” ANC Commissioner Jeffrey Jones wrote in last week’s report. “In an area with a high concentration of both live-in and transient students, late-night student activities and alcohol-fueled student behavior, the university’s ‘see-nothing-hear-nothing-deny-everything’ posture is increasingly unhelpful and objectionable.”
According to Kerr, the measures are not temporary posturing and reflect a long-term commitment to quality of life in and around Georgetown.
“Thursday is the next step in this process, and we’ve certainly been preparing for Thursday’s hearing, but we’re also … planning to continue the dialogue with our neighbors and continue our work on the quality of life initiatives that we feel are making a real difference in the neighborhood,” she said.
The majority of Thursday’s hearing — the last before the Zoning Comission begins deliberations — will be dedicated to discussion of DDOT’s analysis of the plan.
DDOT released a report Nov. 8 declaring that it has no objections to the university’s most recent transportation impact study, which proposed that GUTS buses exclusively use the Canal Road entrance in order to avoid disturbing the surrounding community.
Laverriere was hopeful that the hearing would go well for the university and stressed the importance of students’ support for the plan.
“While [students] may not always agree with everything that the university has done and the initiatives they have put into place, these are drops in the bucket compared to what will happen to this university if we can’t get the Campus Plan approved,” he said.

ReImagine Georgetown awarded grants to three proposals Monday. The annual competition funds projects aiming to improve the undergraduate experience.
Melissa Riggio (COL ’14) and Antony Lopez (COL ’14) were given $1,000 to implement “IlluminateLauinger.” Both students work in the Gelardin New Media Center and intend to use their grant to purchase art-friendly technology for the library.
The pair also proposed hanging student artwork in Lauinger Library’s hallways and study spaces to improve the building’s atmosphere.
“The second half of our agenda was to bring more artistic flavor to [Lauinger] to make it more enjoyable to work in,” Riggio said.
Sam Schneider (COL ’13), a member of The Hoya’s Board of Directors, and Emily Oehlsen (SFS ’13) won a $7,000 grant for “The Georgetown Conversation,” an online forum that will allow members of the community to post video lectures on various topics of expertise or interest. Already under development, the forum is designed to increase intellectual exchange and foster discussion among faculty, students and staff.
Christina Crisostomo (SFS ’13) received a $2,000 award for her proposed series of student-led workshops.
“Through these workshops, students can learn from each other in a fun, pressure-free environment, try new things and meet new people,” Crisostomo said. “I really think the goals of my venture align with the goals of the grant. We’re starting an initiative driven by students, for students and simply trying to make Georgetown an even better place to go to school.”
Every year, grants ranging from $500 to $10,000 are awarded to students, faculty or staff who submit proposals to improve the Georgetown experience for undergraduates.
The grant is sponsored by The Hoya, The Corp and the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union.
This year’s selection committee, which received over 20 applications, consisted of six representatives — two each from The Hoya, The Corp and GUAFSCU.
“We reviewed a lot of really excellent proposals, but the proposals that were ultimately chosen had really unique visions,” said Jack Glascott (COL ’12), GUASFCU’s chief human resources officer and a member of the selection committee.
According to William Cousino (COL ’12), chair of The Corp’s service and outreach committee, the selection process focused on ingenuity, feasibility and the ability to provide the greatest impact on the student population.
“I think what I like most about ReImagine Georgetown is the forum that is created by the partnership between the credit union, The Corp and The Hoya to encourage students to churn out ideas that improve student life,” he said.
Correction: The article incorrectly stated that the workshops spearheaded by Christina Crisostomo(SFS ’13) would be led online. They will be led on campus.

Georgetown’s foodies will no longer have to head off campus to get their culinary fix. The university plans to address students’ gastronomic interests through an initiative for a food studies cluster passed Friday to be implemented next semester.
The grouping, which is being spearheaded by associate professor of French and Francophone studies Sylvie Durmelat, will include courses from the French, biology, chemistry, history and anthropology deparments in the College, as well as the science, technology and international affairs major in the School of Foreign Service. Professors who add the food studies tag to their course on theMyAccess registration system will be responsible for ensuring that a portion of the course is devoted to the topic.
“It’s a way to make classes more visible to students and help them navigate the course catalog,” saidDurmelat, whose class “Food and the French Empire” will be included in the cluster. “It’s also a way for faculty to meet colleagues with similar interests and participate in an interdisciplinary dialogue.”
The food studies cluster is the second to be implemented by the registrar, after the race and ethnic studies cluster. Many students view the development of these groupings as a means of finding courses in areas about which they are passionate without having to rifle through all of the class listings.
“Clusters allow students to obtain a unique perspective on numerous subject areas they are interested in without being confined to … classes that they may not appreciate,” Adrian Mansylla (MSB’13) said.
The first curriculum cluster, race and ethnic studies, was implemented this semester due to concerns about diversity education on campus among faculty members.
“The administration isn’t taking the lead,” University Registrar and Assistant Provost John Pierce said. “This is an opportunity for creativity coming out of individual faculty members. It’s more flexible andfluid.”
The race and ethnic studies cluster offerings next semester include several classes from the history department, but many are cross-listed with the American studies or women’s and gender studies programs.
According to Pierce, introducing a cluster instead of a new minor or major has its own benefits. When an undergraduate college introduces a new minor, it must provide the necessary courses every semester, as opposed to a cluster, whose course offerings are variable depending on the semester.
Environmental studies and ethics have been informally proposed as two additional academic clusters. The development of further groupings depends on student interest.
“Clusters make experimentation more possible,” Pierce said. “That’s the beauty of it.”

The Georgetown University Student Association released a proposal for revisions to the Student Code of Conduct as well as a Bill of Student Rights and Responsibilities Monday.
According to GUSA members, the most notable proposed change is to the burden of proof requirement in code violations.
The revision would change the language of the determination of guilt from “more likely than not” to “clear and convincing” evidence in cases not involving sexual assault as part of an effort to protect students from being penalized in cases based on minimal evidence.
The Bill of Student Rights and Responsibilities drafted by GUSA details student rights, including the freedoms of expression and association and the freedom from discrimination. It gives students the right to deny unreasonable search and seizure by a university official but is not specific about what merits an unreasonable search.
The bill also states that students have the right to be notified of charges against them within at least 10 days of the incident and of sanction decisions within 48 hours of a disciplinary hearing.
According to GUSA members, the bill is also intended to give students a clear sense of their duties as members of the Georgetown community. The document lists responsibilities such as presenting identification to university officials, maintaining positive neighborhood relations and reducing risk-taking behavior.
GUSA Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) and Chief of Staff Mike Barclay (COL ’12) presented the bill to the GUSA Senate Sunday.
Senators raised concerns about how students will be protected from violations of the bill of rights. According to Barclay, GUSA is still discussing an enforcement mechanism to prevent such violations.
The Student Code of Conduct Reform Committee, which is comprised of seven members of GUSA’s executive branch, will hold its first meeting with the Disciplinary Review Committee to discuss the proposed changes Tuesday. Barclay and James Pickens (COL ‘12), co-director of the Student Advocacy Office, will introduce the amendments.
Before any proposed changes can be implemented into the Code of Conduct, they must be approved by the committee, a group that consists of two GUSA cabinet members, the director of student conduct, the associate vice president for student affairs, two faculty members and two appointed students.
The bill of rights must also be approved by the disciplinary committee to become university policy.
Laverriere foresees more changes being made to the bill of rights and the Code of Conduct before they are finalized.
“I think it’s really early on, and I don’t necessarily think the bill of rights we put out will be the final document,” he said. “What we put out today is the beginning of the discussion. It’s by no means the end.”
GUSA is considering a number of methods to gather student input on the bill of rights, including holding town hall meetings and a campus-wide referendum.
“This is something that will affect each individual student on Georgetown’s campus,” Barclay said.
“I think if the bill of rights, or a form of it, were to be adopted I think it would fundamentally alter the way the code was interpreted and acted upon,” Laverriere said.

While students across the country set up Occupy camps on their campuses, D.C.’s wing of the anti-establishment protest movement has garnered little support from Georgetown students.
The cluster of tents in McPherson Square, about 2.5 miles from the front gates, sees about 200 regular protesters per day. Few if any of these dissenters are students from Georgetown.
A group of at least 30 students organized by the Georgetown Solidarity Committee attended a rally on the National Mall Oct. 15. But enthusiasm for the protests has waned since then, according to Gina Bull (SFS ’12), who attended the Oct. 15 gathering.
Bull started a group called Georgetown Occupy about a week after the rally. The group meets weekly but has struggled to maintain consistent support, she said.
“I think there is a certain reputation about Georgetown where students are actively involved in the political institution but are not as eager to get involved in grassroots campaigns like this,” Bull said.
But for some students, it is the nature of the movement, and not of Georgetown students, which explains the lack of interest.
“Their anger is misdirected, and I think, frankly, that it’s no longer a protest movement … It’s just vagrancy,” Tim Carey (COL ’12) said. “I’m not sure how you could be a Georgetown student and livethere.”
Charles Berahas (COL ‘11), who is involved with the Occupy movement, said he feels the lack of student representation can be attributed to the kind of students who attend the university.
“As much as Georgetown likes to deny this, Georgetown students are mostly white, rich, American kids,” he wrote in an email.
Berahas added that he thinks the university itself prevents students from becoming involved. “[The] frameworks through which most political, governmental and economics classes are taught … [produce] alumni who end up representing the very system that the occupy protesters are protesting about,” he said. “The minimal participation of Georgetown students is completely understandable as far as I’m concerned.”
Ben Johnson, a freshman at American University who attended an Occupy D.C. protest Saturday, agreed with Berahas.
“I think Georgetown University lives in its own world,” he said. “Georgetown as a community doesn’t really want to have anything to do with this movement, because Georgetown as a community benefits from the current system.”
Supporters of the Occupy movement have been setting up camp on the campuses of many of Georgetown’s peer institutions.
In Cambridge, Mass., a group of Harvard students have erected about 20 tents in Harvard Yard. An occupy protest has also emerged at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, where about 70 people “occupied” a vacant car dealership, according to The Daily Tar Heel, UNC’s student newspaper.
On the west coast at the University of California-Berkeley, 31 of about 1,000 “Occupy Cal” protesters were arrested last Wednesday after a violent confrontation with campus police. Despite the raid, students have continued to protest in front of the campus’s main entrance.
Bull hoped that the student activism on these campuses might spread to Georgetown.
“We’re not Berkeley, obviously … [but] this is a good opportunity for students to get off the Hilltop and down to the grassroots level,” she said.
Hoya Staff Writers Beth Garbitelli and Matthew Strauss contributed to this report.
Correction: In an earlier version of this story, quotations said by Gina Bull were mistakenly attributed to Vail Kohnert-Yount. The corrected version was posted at 11:45 a.m. Tuesday morning.

LaMarr Billups, assistant vice president for business planning policy, died in his Falls Church, Va., home Friday after a brief illness. He was 59 years old.
Billups, who joined the university in 2007, also served as chairman of the Licensing Oversight Committee, the Advisory Committee on Business Practices and the committee responsible for planning the Martin Luther King,Jr. celebration.
John Kline, a professor in the School of Foreign Service and a member of the Licensing Oversight Committee, said that Billups’ loss was a blow to the university.
“He was so dedicated to the work, particularly to students and to workers,” he said.
Before coming to Georgetown, Billups served as an aide to Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) and senior special assistant to the chancellor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he began his efforts to promote fair labor standards in the production of university apparel.
During his time at Georgetown, Billups led a review of the implementation of the Just Employment Policy and consulted for Alta Gracia, a clothing line that promotes living wages for its employees in the Dominican Republic. Among college campuses, Georgetown was one of the top-10 purchasers of AltaGracia products in the United States this year.
Kline said that although Billups’ work often involved contentious issues, the late administrator was open to all viewpoints.
“He brought a good consensual type of leadership to the issues. He had a quiet type of leadership.”
Kline added that because few students worked with Billups, they may not realize the impact that his work had on the university.
“Students that didn’t have the opportunity to get to know him really missed something,” he said.
University President John J. DeGioia wrote in a statement to The Hoya that he was saddened byBillups’ death.
“Since joining our community in 2007, LaMarr made an immediate and significant contribution to Georgetown,” he wrote.
According to DeGioia, Billups brought a sensitivity to social justice issues to the university.
“His dedication to service, to fair and equitable practices and to improving the lives of others set an example for all of us,” he wrote.
Billups is survived by his wife, Sheryl, and daughter Rachel Montgomery. A memorial service in his honor will be held at the university in the coming days; the date is yet to be determined.

Campus politicos are putting allegiances aside to make resident voices through student voter registration drives this semester.
In the recent past, the Georgetown University College Democrats have been the only major sponsors of voter drives on campus.
“Every year around October, we go to every freshman dorm and knock on every single door to ask them if they’d like to register to vote,” Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), president of the College Democrats, said.
This year’s College Democrat voter registration drive was unique, however, in that it was co-sponsored by the College Republicans and D.C. Students Speak.
Joseph Knowles (COL ’12), chairman of the College Republicans, said he was not sure why his political group has not held voter signups in previous years.
“This year I proposed to the College Democrats and pushed for a co-sponsored voter drive. I think the two groups cooperating will provide more credibility to the non-partisan quality of the event,” Knowles said.
Joe Vandergriff (COL ’14), membership director of the College Democrats, stressed that the campus’ political groups share a common goal of making young votes count despite their competing political ideologies.
“We have the same objectives. We want to make our voices to be heard,” Vandergriff said. “The demographic of our age is not represented enough.”
According to Kohnert-Yount, the joint drive registered about 100 students, an amount in line with past drives.
For College Democrats Darnall Hall Dorm Captain Nora West (SFS ’15), the long-term mission of the drive was worth her volunteer hours.
“The whole goal of the drive is to get more people to vote, regardless of who they are voting for,” she said. “Civic involvement begins with voting, so registering even one voter is worth our time.”
The Georgetown chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People also held a voter registration drive last Friday.
“In the past, the voter drives weren’t as successful as we hoped [they] could be. However, this year, the goal of our political action committee is clear. We aim to register more people who are underrepresented on-campus and off-campus to vote,” said Rashawn Davis (COL ’14), chair of the Georgetown NAACP PAC.
According to Davis, however, the chapter’s hopes for the drive did not come to fruition.
“We aimed to register at least 50 people but only ended up with around 15 people,” he said. “A lot of students said they were uncomfortable with registering, while some felt that their votes wouldn’t make a difference.”
The NAACP will hold another push for registration at the D.C. high school fair at Eastern Senior High School this Saturday. It aims to register the parents of D.C. high school students.
“Eastern High school is in a neighborhood where 20 to 30 percent of the people, many of them African-Americans, aren’t registered for voting,” Davis said. “With that many people present at the occasion, we can really make an impact there.”
Davis said the chapter plans to hold an additional voter registration drive before Christmas and more in the spring semester in preparation for the District’s April elections.

Congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) spoke about human rights and the stability of Israeli democracy in Copley Formal Lounge Monday night.
Frank has represented Massachussetts’ fourth congressional district since 1980 and is the first openly gay member of Congress. His speech was the first event in Israel Week, which is sponsored by the College Democrats and J Street U Georgetown. The talk was also sponsored by the Georgetown Israel Alliance and GU Pride.
Frank underscored his support for a sustainable peace process for Israel and Palestine and the importance of a continued friendship between the United States and Israel.
“[From] every value that I have gone into politics to pursue and protect … out of any state in the Middle East, Israel comes closest to that.”
Frank also said he recognized the need for better treatment of Arab settlers and citizens within the Israeli state.
“It is entirely legitimate to say Israel has made mistakes, but the obstacle to peace right now is not Israel, it is Hamas,” he said.
Calling Israel the most open democracy in the Middle East, Frank pointed to the country’s support for women’s and gay rights. He said that Israel’s democratic success countered the notion that democracy is only sustainable in safe regions.
“Israel has spent its entire existence at war and is one of the most important democracies in the world,” he said.
