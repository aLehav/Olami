The Georgetown University graduate student group, GU Chinese Students and Scholars Association, has received substantial funding from the Chinese government in years past, though the group has not broken any university funding rules, a recent report from Foreign Policy alleges.
The documentation of the funding points to Chinese government involvement with student groups on American college campuses, a link that is often suspected though difficult to prove, Foreign Policy reports. While not illegal, these relationships have been under scrutiny from U.S. security organizations, who have attempted for years to ascertain what, if any, threat the Chinese government and students pose to the United States.
The outlet wrote that it had obtained documents and emails from “a source concerned about Chinese Communist Party influence on university campuses” that showed the group had received about $1,600 in funding from the Chinese government, amounting to roughly half its annual budget in 2011.
Rachel Pugh, Georgetown’s senior director for strategic communications, said the university ensures all student groups adhere to university and government policies.
“As a global university, our international student body hails from more than 125 nations and contributes valuable experiences and perspectives that enhance the diversity and scholarship of our community,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We ensure that all student organizations comply with applicable financial rules and regulations.”
Founded in the early 2000s, Georgetown’s chapter of the national organization boasts a membership of about 230 students, most of whom are Chinese nationals and graduate students, according to the organization’s HoyaLink description. In addition to providing an on-campus space for Chinese graduate students adjusting to life at Georgetown, the CSSA helps connect the Chinese community on campus with other on-campus student groups to promote Chinese culture, according to group’s page.
A graduate student group, CSSA operates independently from undergraduate student organizations and receives much of its funding from the university and the Graduate Student Government through the Office of Graduate Enrichment Organizations. The Foreign Policy report states that the documentation of the funds comes from a September 2011 budget request received by Georgetown’s Graduate Student Government, which disclosed that the group received $800 each semester that school year from the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C. The group requested an additional $750 each semester from the university on top of the money it received from the embassy, the request said.
While CSSA could not be reached for comment, members of the group said in their 2011 budget request that the Chinese funding was used to host events, such as the annual Chinese New Year party in 2011.
Georgetown has no rule against student groups receiving money from foreign governments, according to Kylie Navarro (COL ’20), chair of the Student Activities Commission, the funding and advisory board that allocates resources to university-recognized undergraduate groups.
“There is no university policy that prevents student groups from receiving money from any outside source, including foreign governments,” Navarro wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Outside funding sources are not considered when SAC makes a decision to allocate funding. Groups are not even required to report outside funding to SAC.”
Navarro said it is unlikely that SAC will be looking further into whether funding has come from foreign governments at the undergraduate level.
The CSSA also serves as a support network for Chinese students at nearly 150 other universities across the United States, including the University of Maryland, the University of California, San Diego and the University of Connecticut. The groups began to pop up more regularly in the 1980s, when Chinese students began to study abroad in the United States more regularly, The Washington Post reported in May 2017.
The groups often work with oversight from the Chinese government, advocating for pro-Chinese government agendas on campuses, according to The Washington Post.
The information newly reported by Foreign Policy follows a growing trend of tension between Chinese student groups and universities across the country. Students in the CSSA at other institutions have clashed with administrators at their universities over different decisions affecting Chinese culture.
The club protested a presentation on human rights violations in China at Columbia University a decade ago. At the University of Maryland, the CSSA responded to an address given by a Chinese student praising free speech in May 2017. The group responded by posting a video titled “Proud of China UMD,” composed of video segments responding to the student’s address.
“We are deeply concerned about some of the stereotypical comments in her speech, and we, Chinese students at UMD, decided to reply with the following videos,” the opening slide of the video read.

the chinese government supporting chinese student groups??? Shocker!

The CPC is not a friend to this country, to freedom or democracy. Their state news mocks our beliefs in these things. 
We would not have allowed the USSR to fund student groups or activities on our campuses. We should not allow the CCP to do so. This is a country that imprisons people for disparaging the government. Imagine being imprisoned for saying you don’t like Donald Trump or tweeting it. Or for saying he is an idiot.
You can’t imagine that. You don’t want to.

Your xenophobic racism is showing – what is there to be gained by stoking fears against Chinese students who, like you, just want to be here peacefully, learn, and celebrate the New Year?
This is like saying that the US supporting its nationals abroad through embassy and cultural services is also wrong.

Chinese calling anybody a Xenophonic Racist is a dead giveaway.
The PRC has bern funding leftist student groups in the US since the 1960s Third World Liberation Front. Just ask Floyd Huen.

So… Student group gets outside funding, which is acknowledged to be a perfectly acceptable and widespread practice, and breaks no rules? But there has to be a story villifying Chinese so let’s bring in a whole bunch of unrelated anecdotes from other schools. Literally what was the point of this- Chinese nationals get a thousand bucks from a cultural ministry to celebrate Chinese New Year and it’s a scandal…. how?

Clearly FP (the magazine on which this article is based) and The Hoya are really scared of us Chinese students! I mean, hosting Chinese New Year celebrations, the “occasional academic forum,” and social events?!?!
Everyone knows dumplings are just the first step to armed insurrection.
[…] week, by obtaining private documents, Foreign Policy magazine reported the Chinese government has provided substantial funding for Georgetown University Chinese Students and Scholars Association, a graduate […]

Logan Arkema (COL ’20) and Jonathan Compo (COL ’20) are not like the other candidates running for president and vice president of the Georgetown University Student Association. They go by the names of fictional comic book figures Batman and Robin, wear the characters’ costumes and admit they are hoping they will not win.
With their campaign, Arkema and Compo, a former cartoonist for The Hoya, join a list of past joke candidates who have launched campaigns focused on satirizing rather than winning. In a Saturday interview with The Hoya, Arkema, wearing a full Batman suit and adopting a raspy voice, said the primary goal of his campaign is “comic relief.”
“A lot of students get annoyed with GUSA campaigns,” Arkema said. “It’s nice to provide something that’s a little bit different, that kind of pokes fun at the general campus culture.”
According to Arkema, this year’s candidates bear the same qualities that have frustrated students in the past: They take themselves and their campaigns too seriously and promise too much.
“Not everything needs to be done super seriously. We are college students and if there’s one time to have fun and take life back a little bit, it’s right now,” Arkema said.
Arkema and Compo are running against Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) and Richard Howell (SFS ’19), Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) and Naba Rahman (SFS ’19), and Josh Siriois (SFS ’20) and Casey Doherty (COL ’20). Election day is set for Feb. 22.
Past satirical candidates include a 2016 ticket filed on behalf of two popular sandwiches served at Wisemiller’s grocery store and deli, the Chicken Madness and the Hot Chick. The most recent winning satirical ticket, former GUSA president Joe Luther (COL ’16) and vice president Connor Rohan (COL ’16) originally ran as a satirical ticket in 2015, but developed robust policy platforms on mental health and sexual assault over the course of the campaign.
Arkema also said the other campaigns’ wide-ranging policy platforms — Sirois and Doherty’s platform consists of 24 major planks, while Nair and Rahman’s has 30 — make it difficult for students to discern their true priorities.
Arkema’s campaign declared four significant staff members to the GUSA Election Commission, including the current and former chairpersons of the Georgetown University College Democrats, Maria Cornell (SFS ’20) and Larry Huang (COL ’19). Arkema is membership director of GUCD.
Arkema currently serves as a GUSA senator representing Southwest Quad in the voice and character of Batman; he was elected in the fall running on the sole promise to conduct all official senate business as Batman. Colleagues interviewed by The Hoya say Arkema has held true to his promise, but has also largely taken his work in the senate seriously.
A member of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee, a workers’ rights advocacy group, Arkema has focused on labor issues in the senate, meeting weekly with the graduate student unionization drive led by the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees.
“It is possible to take issues that affect us seriously without necessarily taking ourselves with the same level of seriousness,” Arkema said.
While Arkema said GUSA is filled with people who want to see change, he believes many members become more concerned with putting their name on something, inflating their egos or building their resumes than on achieving results. The association also tends to be too insular, Arkema said.
“Everyone mentions these things, all the problems that I’ve listed, but no one takes concrete action to differ from that.”
Arkema clarified that he respects the “vast majority of the candidates currently running” and would be willing to work with whichever ticket wins.
“But I also think that constructive satirical criticism is something that’s worth being engaged in,” Arkema said.
Representatives of two other campaigns — Sirois and Doherty’s and Nair and Rahman’s — have met with Arkema and said they would be open to discussing workers’ rights issues, Arkema said.
Compo, Arkema’s running mate has been with Arkema from the beginning of what they call his Batman “shenanigans.” Compo was the only person listed on Arkema’s senate campaign staff in the fall, and acts as an informal adviser to Arkema in his senate capacity, according to Arkema.
Compo was unavailable Saturday afternoon for an interview with The Hoya.
While Arkema and Compo emphasized they do not want to win, he presented a “victory contingency plan” in case they do; he said it would be “irresponsible” not to be prepared to govern in the unlikely scenario that they are elected.
The contingency plan includes assembling an administration through an “open and transparent application process” for every position. None of the members of their campaign have been promised any positions, according to a flyer summarizing the plan provided to The Hoya. The plan also includes their only serious policy proposal: encouraging professors to use open-source textbooks.
Arkema said he would still conduct most business as Batman, he said he may break character in meetings with administrators or other settings that call for seriousness. And, Arkema added, staying in the Batman voice can be a strain.
“I am very confident that I have lacerated my voice over the past five months,” Arkema said.

In Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) and Richard Howell’s (SFS ’19) campaign pitch for the Georgetown University Student Association’s executive offices, the candidates promise they will be the student body’s “bulldog” against the rising costs of tuition and mandatory textbooks.
Estes and Howell are running for GUSA president and vice president, respectively, on promises to reduce Georgetown education costs, as well as efforts to instill a sense of community and a culture of service on campus.
In a Saturday interview with The Hoya, the pair emphasized their extensive student leadership experience, but acknowledged their similar personal backgrounds and conservative views may alienate some voters. They insisted they would “fight for every student” if elected, and said they hope students will evaluate them on their policy platform.
Estes and Howell are running against satirical ticket Logan Arkema (COL ’20) and Jonathan Compo (COL ’20), Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) and Naba Rahman (SFS ’19), and Josh Sirois (SFS ’20) and Casey Doherty (COL ’20). The election is set for Feb. 22.
Estes and Howell said they have devoted much of their time on campus to giving back to the Georgetown community.
A Maryland native, Estes has led Georgetown’s chapter of the Knights of Columbus, the world’s largest Catholic service fraternal organization. He was also elected to the GUSA senate last year and served on the Finance and Appropriations Committee, which allocates over $1 million to student groups each year. Estes has also worked on GUSA’s free speech policy team, and he served on the board of the Georgetown University College Republicans in 2016.
Howell comes from a small rural town in southern New Jersey. He has worked with Estes as a member of the Knights of Columbus and the GUSA free speech policy team. Howell has also served as treasurer of GUCR and sits on the associate board of the Lecture Fund, which organizes speaker events on campus.
Estes and Howell said they first met during the second lecture of their freshman year economics class after Estes accidentally flung a pen across the classroom into the back of Howell’s head. They then bonded over their similar extracurricular interests and points of view.
“We thrive off each other. We’re energized by similar commitments and we formed bonds through similar desires in terms of what we want to do in our time here,” Estes said.
The pair only decided to run for the GUSA executive in the last three weeks after another ticket they had planned to support dropped out, Estes said.
Estes and Howell’s platform focuses on three core planks: cost, community and charity.
The pair’s plan to reduce costs includes advocating for a tuition-freeze policy, which would guarantee that each student pays the same tuition for the duration of their time at Georgetown, pushing the university to dismiss “redundant” administrators and asking professors to reduce textbook expenses by pledging to post their own textbooks and sections from other books online.
The pair said their platform on cutting cost is “ambitious,” but rightly so.
“Honestly, I don’t understand what the purpose of the student government would be if it weren’t trying to tackle this problem,” Howell said.
All three of the ticket’s major affordability proposals have been discussed at some level by Georgetown administrators, according to Estes. He said their goals are achievable in the hands of a GUSA executive willing to “actually stand up to the administration.”
If nothing else, Estes said, they hope their campaign will pressure the administration to take the issue of tuition costs more seriously.
The candidates’ second platform plank, community, is inspired by Estes and Howell’s concern that the student body shares too few common experiences at Georgetown that make them feel welcome and united.
Apart from a commitment to organize more community events, the second plank includes a range of policy priorities, including improving accessibility, expanding access to stipends for off-campus mental health care and increasing sexual assault awareness and training.
With their third plank, charity, Estes and Howell hope to instill a “culture of service” at Georgetown. They plan to organize a community service day and encourage student groups and individuals to organize their own community service projects.
In their GUSA budget proposal submitted to the Election Commission on Wednesday, Estes and Howell request $17,500, a relatively lean total compared with Nair and Rahman’s $25,325 request and Sirois and Doherty’s $28,000 request.
Estes said he stands out among the other presidential candidates because of his range of GUSA expertise and his relationships with administrators and alumni, which he said would help the pair advance their policy goals. Estes has worked with administrators as a student representative on the university’s Speech and Expression Committee and last year on the executive board of the Alumni Association.
As vice president, Howell said he would bring an outsider’s perspective to GUSA that resonates with a common criticism that GUSA is small, insular and self-serving. Last year’s executive election saw a 38 percent turnout from the student body.
“A lot of people are turned off by the student government on this campus. Voter turnout is abysmally low,” Howell said. “A big part of this is how do we get GUSA to better interact with the students?”
With their similar personal backgrounds and conservative views, the candidates said their main shortcomings as a ticket concern their ability to represent the entire student body.
“We recognize that we’re conservative students; we’re Catholic students. We know what communities we’ve been involved in on campus and which we haven’t,” Estes said.
In the GUSA senate last spring, Estes was the only senator to vote against two resolutions expressing opposition to two of President Donald Trump’s policies that affected Georgetown student. One resolution expressed support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration policy and the other voiced opposition to an executive order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, according to public voting records and various then-senators serving with Estes.
Last October, Estes publicly defended the socially conservative views of Love Saxa, a student group that promotes traditional views of marriage and sexuality, amid calls for the university to strip the group’s funding by students who claimed the group’s stance on gay marriage fostered hatred against LGBTQ students.
Estes said he does not agree with all of Love Saxa’s views, and insisted he would defend the rights of any group on campus whether he agreed with them or not. While working on GUSA’s free speech policy team, he said, he worked with the president of the pro-abortion rights group H*yas for Choice to defend the group’s right to promote its views on campus.
“We’re here to love every student, to fight for every student and the causes that are brought to us that need to be fought for,” Estes said.
The candidates hope to unify the student body around the issues they plan to work on, including improving campus accessibility and expanding access to mental health care. Specifically, Estes said the ticket’s focus on affordability speaks to a common Georgetown experience.
“We were brought here on financial aid. We’re both here on scholarships. I’m working two jobs just to support my time to even be here at Georgetown. And that’s an issue that a lot of students relate to. That goes beyond skin color, that goes beyond our beliefs,” Estes said. “I ask that you evaluate us based on our policies, based on our platform, for what we believe is good for the student body.”

When Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) and Naba Rahman (SFS ’19) first met on a national debate circuit their senior year of high school, they never would have anticipated that four years later they would run in the Georgetown University Student Association’s 2018 executive election.
The pair promises to amplify student voices, running on the campaign slogan “Because Every Voice Matters.” Nair and Rahman have defined the executive’s primary role as facilitating students’ efforts and ideas. With limited GUSA experience and a less detailed policy platform compared to their opponents’, they are seeking to sell voters on their outside leadership roles and relationship-building skills.
“We are not here to be the face of every diversity group. We are here though to help those voices finally get a platform,” Rahman said in an interview with The Hoya. “Our job is to get them a seat at the table.”
Nair is running for president with Rahman as vice president. They face satirical ticket Logan Arkema (COL ’20) and Jonathan Compo (COL ’20), Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) and Richard Howell (SFS’19), and Josh Sirois (SFS ’20) and Casey Doherty (COL ’20) in the Feb. 22 election.
Nair is director of external outreach at Innovo Consulting, a group that connects social entrepreneurs and nonprofit organizations to Georgetown students. He was born in India, but moved with his family to Kentucky when two years old, where he was the only person of color in his elementary school and the first student from his high school to attend Georgetown.
Rahman was the secretary general of the National Collegiate Security Conference, a model United Nations conference for college students, last semester and has been involved with the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, a $1.5 million student-run fund that allocates grant money to student and alumni social ventures. A Mississippi native, Rahman said her experiences growing up shaped their campaign’s main promise.
“I am Muslim, Pakistani and I’m a woman, so for me I always found myself never really part of the group,” Rahman said.
The pair began discussing a potential ticket in mid-November over lunch in O’Donovan Hall. Rahman first approached Nair with the idea, according to him.
“It was something Naba was thinking about seriously first,” Nair said. “I then came back to her and said this is not only something I think you should just do but something we should do together.”
Nair and Rahman are running on a broad platform covering 30 policy areas. Their platform is built on three themes: inclusion, opportunity and accountability. Rahman said GUSA alienates most Georgetown students, which the pair seek to rectify by actively engaging more student clubs.
Nair emphasized the participatory nature of their platform. Many of their points emphasize dialogue, soliciting student input on issues and connecting students to relevant campus resources.
“Naba and I are running on the credo that every voice matters,” Nair said. “The way we want to organize this campaign and this administration is increasing the base-line quality of a Georgetown students experience here.”
In particular, the pair seek to prioritize mental and sexual health. Nair and Rahman said they plan to increase funding for the mental health stipend, which will provide off-campus mental health support for 10 to 20 students with demonstrated financial need, and offer private weekly STI screenings at the student health center.
Academic affairs are another priority for the ticket. Nair wants Georgetown to offer college minor programs to students in all undergraduate schools and to schedule more study days before final exams.
Their platform also includes increased funding for GUSA Fund — a discretionary budget that directs funds from the student activities fee — from $15,000 to $20,000. They also plan to direct the funds resources to three key areas: student wellness, innovation and diversity and inclusion.
Nair and Rahman emphasized the role they would play in facilitating other students’ ideas in addition to promoting their own priorities. Rahman said GUSA currently places the responsibility on students to seek out GUSA’s help.
“That should not be the case,” Rahman said. “The onus should not be on you as students, rather it should be on us as GUSA to reach out to you.”
The pair proposed community advisory groups in which student groups would get face-to-face time with the executive on a rotating basis. Rahman said this open-door policy would allow more students the chance to voice their opinions.
A potential weakness for the pair lies in their relatively limited GUSA experience and their lack of relationships with GUSA leadership and university administrators, as Nair and Rahman acknowledged. Rahman served on GUSA’s Federal and D.C. Relations committee, a part of the GUSA executive, for six months while Nair has no past GUSA experience.
“Sahil and I are not immune to the fact that we do not have the GUSA experience that some other people may,” Rahman said.
Nair said the pair would use their experience as leaders in other student organizations to develop relationships with administrators. He added he is an “ideas-driven person” and “an individual that enjoys building relationships and communicating.”
Their external experiences in other student organizations provides the pair with a perspective on where GUSA’s shortcomings are, Rahman said. “We’ve both seen what GUSA looks like from the outside, and we have seen the resources that are available but are not communicated out nor are connected to the student body.”
Another potential liability for the campaign is Rahman’s plan not to stay on campus for the summer. She has accepted a summer internship with Morgan Stanley in New York.
Per GUSA bylaws, the president must stay on campus for the duration of the summer. While there is no such requirement for vice presidents, vice presidential candidates Doherty and Howell have committed to staying in Washington, D.C., if elected. Rahman pledged to commute to D.C. on weekends.
“I’ll be going back and forth, it’s been done before, it can be done again,” Rahman said. “It is a bit foolish to think that just because the two executives are here in D.C., the entire GUSA administration is going to be running.”
After speaking with current GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19), Nair said they plan to involve their policy heads as much as possible over the summer to prepare for the academic year.
Nair emphasized GUSA’s influence on campus, particularly as a tool for agenda-setting.
“When GUSA talks about an issue, it’s what this campus talks about, it’s what our publications write about and it’s what our administrations are going to be hearing about,” Nair said. “So being participatory and soliciting those ideas from students is exactly what GUSA should be doing.”

Five fire alarms in the Southwest Quad have been accidentally set off since Jan. 19, causing buildingwide evacuations in the dormitories at various points in the middle of the night and afternoon, and prompting repairs by Planning and Facilities Management and criticism of the university’s handling of the alarms.
Three of the alarms occurred in the middle of the night, from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m., and two in the afternoon. Students living in Reynolds, Kennedy and McCarthy Halls evacuated each time the alarm sounded.
The cause of the alarms has been identified and repairs are underway, according to a Feb. 9 email from the Office of Planning and Facilities Management and the Office of Residential Living sent to Southwest Quad residents.
“While work is in-progress, precautions have been taken to prevent future fire alarms related to the issue,” the email read. “We are confident any future fire alarms will not be related to this ongoing issue.”
Facilities Management did not specify what issue had caused the fire alarms.
The email followed an alarm that went off at about 3 a.m. on Feb. 9, which caused many residents to feel the university was failing to address the root of the problem.
Southwest Quad resident Nabil Kapasi (SFS ’20) said the frequency of the alarms should have been cause for greater concern.
“The inability to control fire alarms showed a serious lack of urgency by the administration. It went off multiple times before the night alarm, so it wasn’t a random occurrence,” Kapasi said. “The fact that they hadn’t dealt with it before throwing hundreds of students into the cold at 3 a.m. is appalling and almost unbelievable; how can such an important thing, something that impacts our homes, be left untreated?”
Southwest Quad resident Ana Madero (SFS ’20) expressed a similar sentiment regarding the lack of action on the university’s part.
“I’d say the worst part is the lack of accountability from the university,” Madero said. “All we would get is an email saying, ‘sorry for the inconvenience’ with no logical reasoning behind them.”
The university stressed the importance of building occupants evacuating immediately after the fire alarm sounds in the Feb. 9 email.
“Moving forward, should the fire alarm activate in your building, it remains extremely important that you continue to treat these alarms seriously,” the email said. “Your safety remains our highest priority.”
However, the repeated alarms over the last few weeks have caused the significance of each to diminish, according to Southwest Quad resident Youngho Yun (MSB ’20).
“The biggest problem I see is people taking fire alarms lightly now,” Yun said. “I’ve seen some people go back into their rooms and wait it out, instead of walking out of the building.”
Madero noticed a similar trend of students ignoring the fire alarms.
“I’m just worried that this has caused a ‘boy who cried wolf’ type of situation,” Madero said.
The university plans to notify all Southwest Quad residents via email of the reason for future fire alarm activations within 12 hours of each alarm, according to the Feb 9. email.

Emphasizing their campaign motto “Moving Forward,” Josh Sirois (SFS ’20) and Casey Doherty (COL ’20) are running for president and vice president, respectively, of the Georgetown University Student Association to champion existing projects and advance new ideas.
Sirois and Doherty are running on a detailed policy platform and a combined four years of student government experience, while attempting to shake the stigma of an establishment “GUSA insider” ticket.
Hailing from Salem, Mo., Sirois is a GUSA senator who previously served on the senate’s Finance and Appropriations Committee, which allocates over $1 million to student groups each year. He is also a member of acapella group Superfood and the tour guide group Blue and Gray.
Doherty is co-secretary of congressional relations on GUSA’s Federal and D.C. Relations Committee, where she led recent efforts to advocate U.S. Congress to pass the Dream Act of 2017, an immigration bill protecting students without documentation. She also serves on the College Academic Council and is a coordinator for Georgetown Opportunities for Leadership Development. She is from Glennville, New York.
Sirois and Doherty are running against three other tickets: the satirical ticket Logan Arkema (COL ’20) and Jonathan Compo (COL ’20), Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) and Richard Howell (SFS ’19), and Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) and Naba Rahman (SFS ’19). The election is set for Feb. 22.
Sirois first considered running last year after current GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19), then a sophomore, ran successfully for GUSA president alongside current GUSA Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18). Sirois campaigned for one of the tickets opposing Mack, Garet Williams (COL ’18) and Habon Ali (SFS ’18).
Initially, Sirois planned to run with Precious King (SFS ’20), but King stepped down shortly after winter break. Sirois and Doherty said King resigned for “personal reasons,” which they declined to specify. King declined to comment on her resignation.
Doherty, who originally led the campaign’s policy team, replaced King as the vice presidential candidate in late January. King continues to work on the campaign as an adviser.
Sirois and Doherty are running on a wide-ranging platform addressing 24 policy areas. In a Sunday interview with The Hoya, they emphasized that their ideas — organized into three pillars of affordability and access, student health and wellness and student empowerment — will produce concrete and specific results.
Sirois said he plans to concentrate on affordability and access if elected. On the issue of accessibility, he plans to advocate for a handicapped-accessible entrance on Lauinger Library’s first floor.
Long term, Sirois said he wants meal plans to include more flex dollars, so students do not waste meal swipes on lower-priced items. Sirois and Doherty also expressed support for Hoya Hub, an on-campus food pantry that members of GUSA are developing to counter food insecurity.
Sirois and Doherty’s affordability plan focuses on academic and cost-of-living expenses, such as restructuring meal plans and encouraging professors to upload textbooks online. They also promised to advocate increased transparency and student involvement in the tuition-setting process, but called Estes and Howell’s calls for a tuition freeze for current students “unrealistic.”
Doherty also pledged to concentrate on safety and combatting sexual assault. She proposed registration holds for students who fail to complete bystander training and a potential partnership with New Student Orientation to include sexual health and relationships programming.
Throughout their policy proposals, Sirois and Doherty stressed student empowerment, which they connected to one of their self-identified strengths: building relationships.
“So many of these ideas and these plans didn’t just come from Casey and I’s minds. We have sat down with club leaders. I sat down with [Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Services], and the president said he doesn’t think in history, any other GUSA candidate has sat down and asked them what they think,” Sirois said.
Sirois and Doherty are the only sophomores among this year’s non-satirical candidates, a class status they acknowledge some students may perceive as a weakness. Instead, they framed it as a strength.
“It’s been described as a weakness that we are both sophomores, but I think that at Georgetown it honestly makes a lot of sense,” Sirois said. “We’re not going to be here in the fall looking for jobs, we’re going to be living right on campus. This is our prime dedication.”
Georgetown has elected at least two all-sophomore executive teams since 1969, according to GUSA historian Ari Goldstein (COL ’18). The most recent all-sophomore ticket elected GUSA president and vice president served in 2009, according to Goldstein.
Both Sirois and Doherty also noted that they have pledged to stay on campus for the summer, noting a contrast with Rahman, one of the other vice presidential candidates, who plans to spend most of the summer interning for Morgan Stanley in New York. GUSA bylaws require presidents to stay in Washington, D.C., during the summer months but do not impose restrictions on vice presidents.
Some students may portray them as a GUSA establishment ticket, as Sirois and Doherty acknowledged. Since the fall of their freshman year, Sirois has served in the GUSA senate and Doherty has worked in the GUSA executive. Eight of the 12 campaign staff members listed on their website are involved in GUSA.
Still, the pair have sought to distance themselves from the stigma associated with “GUSA insiders,” vowing in a message on their campaign website to reform the association “made up of an often-insular Executive and the same group of Senators each year.”
Their ideas to make GUSA more inclusive include creating a GUSA general body, which would meet regularly and allow students to get involved without joining any particular policy coalition.
Doherty emphasized in Saturday’s interview that she and Sirois have “new, actionable, concrete ideas that aren’t just playing off what the current administration has done.”
Sirois said understanding the GUSA system would help them advance their policy goals.
“The ins and outs of GUSA I do know pretty well. I’d say that’s one of the most important qualifications of doing this job. There’s a drastic learning curve, and we saw that, honestly, with Kamar and Jessica,” Sirois said.
Sirois, Doherty and their campaign team encouraged students to vote based on candidates’ policy proposals rather than social media pages and publicity efforts.
“We really feel like we created the best policy — the most actionable, concrete and specific — that we can start to implement right away,” Doherty said. “We know that not everything GUSA does is sexy, but it does need to be done, and the projects really do create positive change.”

The Washington, D.C. Council passed legislation last week authorizing publicly financed campaigns, a move that comes in the middle of the 2018 D.C. mayoral campaign season.
Dubbed the Fair Elections Act, the bill would allow candidates to receive 5-to-1 matching funds from the city if they restrict their fundraising to only city residents, with individual donations not to exceed $50. The legislation would also only apply to mayoral, attorney general, D.C. council and school board candidates.
Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) and Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) introduced the most recent iteration of the bill after multiple previous attempts to pass the bill in earlier council periods.
Erik Salmi, the communications director for Allen, said this bill has the potential to change the way candidates campaign and interact with their constituents.
“It’s going to change the incentives for candidates for office to spend more of their time with D.C. residents rather than dialing for dollars with the more typical older, whiter, wealthier audiences who can afford to make a maximum donation,” Salmi said.
Supporters of the bill, such as James Butler, a candidate in the 2018 D.C. mayoral race, also believe it would give more power to smaller donors and local candidates, helping to level the playing field against wealthier and more established candidates.
“Fair elections would give a voice and a chance to candidates like myself by the city matching contributions of those small donors,” Butler said.
However, the bill has also garnered some opposition, most notably from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D). LaToya Foster, a spokeswoman for Bowser, said she believes the funds necessary to finance the bill are a waste of taxpayer money.
“With so many pressing needs for residents, it is not prudent to divert tax dollars from hiring more police, investing in housing or fixing our roads to paying for robocalls, negative attack ads and donor receptions,” Foster wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In response to the criticism, Salmi said the impact that the allocation of funds would have on the budget is small in comparison to the lasting benefits the bill would bring to D.C. voters.
“D.C. already spends quite a bit of money on our election system,” Salmi said. “To say it’s a waste of taxpayer money, I just don’t think it’s a fair criticism of investing in the health of our democracy, and opening it up to more people, and really ensuring that D.C. voters trust that this is a process they can get behind.”
The legislation likely will not take effect until the 2020 elections, but its recent passing in council comes ahead of the 2018 D.C. mayoral election, for which Bowser has already announced her bid for re-election.
The District’s Democratic primary race is often a good indicator of the outcome of the general election, because of D.C.’s strong Democratic leanings. Aside from Bowser, there are a number of declared candidates, including James Butler, an advisory neighborhood commissioner for Ward 5; Manley Collins, an AmeriCorps service member; and Michael Christian Woods, a 19-year-old student at The George Washington University.
Apart from the Democratic challengers, independent candidate Dustin Canter has also declared. As an independent, he highlighted some of the difficulties in running a serious campaign.
Running against an incumbent mayor poses a series of challenges, one of the largest being fundraising, according to Butler. Bowser has already raised close to $2 million for her 2018 campaign and is on track to match or exceed her 2014 sum. Butler said it was difficult competing against someone so established with the ability to raise large sums of money.
“Money is the big challenge,” Butler said. “A lot of people know that these records become public, so they’re a little bit reticent to give because they don’t want their name placed on the public campaign roll.”

Touting Washington, D.C., as an up-and-coming hotspot for various technology companies, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) led a city economic planning team to Silicon Valley to pitch the District as a prime location for new businesses.
Bowser’s team met with a wide array of tech companies, including the Kapor Center for Social Impact, Apple, Uber, Lyft, Cisco, Yelp, sap.io and Mapbox on Feb. 9.
Bowser and Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development Brian Kenner’s visit to Silicon Valley follows Amazon’s announcement that both Washington, D.C., and northern Virginia had made the short list of 20 finalists for the location of its new headquarters.
Chanda Washington, director of communications in the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development, said the information included in the District’s Amazon bid was also used in the presentations with tech companies in Silicon Valley.
“We were planning for the West Coast Mission during the summer of 2017,” Washington wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Initially we had hoped to travel in October but postponed the trip when Amazon released its [Request for Proposals]. As we were preparing our Amazon bid in October, we saw an opportunity to use the same information to showcase what makes D.C. a great place to grow a business.”
Washington said that the overall response to the presentation from companies was positive, citing people with connections to the District working in Silicon Valley as a positive influence.
“The response was positive,” Washington wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Tech companies and organizations see the strength of D.C.’s tech scene and welcomed our discussions regarding how to build upon it. Interestingly, with each group, we met someone with a D.C. connection which demonstrates the vitality of our tech community.”
The Office of the Deputy Mayor has been working to make D.C. a more entrepreneurial city through a number of projects that aim to increase racial and economic diversity and foster a more inclusive environment for entrepreneurs.
“[We are] invested in organizations like IN3 and Beacon to ensure there is a diverse and inclusive tech scene in the District [and] in the creation of the Director of Tech Sector Engagement position at the Washington D.C. Economic Partnership,” Washington wrote. “Within the office of the Deputy Mayor, we also have a team devoted to strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the District.”
The Office of the Mayor put in a Request for Information regarding the implementation of a new program called the Inclusive Innovation Fund. on Feb. 6. The goal of the RFI is to obtain feedback from investment professionals and entrepreneurs in D.C. about potential partnerships, investment capital needs and program design.
“The project seeks to increase access to capital for D.C. entrepreneurs, and particularly for underrepresented entrepreneurs, such as people of color and women by creating an investment fund focused on early stage ventures,” according to a Feb. 6 news release from the Office of the Mayor.
According to Washington, though the visit to Silicon Valley was not directly related to the Inclusive Innovation Fund, it provided a platform for potential investors to respond to the RFI.
“We used the trip to share information about our effort to create an Inclusive Innovation Fund. It gave us an opportunity to put the Request for Information in front of potential investors who might have insight about how to create the fund,” Washington said.
Kenner said the Inclusive Innovation Fund is an important step forward for the future of D.C.’s entrepreneurial community.
“Washington continues to rank No. 1 as a place for entrepreneurs who are women or people of color to thrive, but there are barriers that still need to break down, including access to capital,” Kenner said in a statement to radio station WTOP.
The Office of the Mayor could not be reached for comment.
