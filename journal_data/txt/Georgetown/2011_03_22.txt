Burglars have struck at least two student homes on Bank Street between Prospect and M streets in the past few weeks.
The latest burglary occurred Wednesday, according to Andrew Brewster (COL ’11), whose house was burglarized at about 4 p.m. Elizabeth Chapman (COL ’11), who lives across the street from Brewster, said her house was broken into on March 3.
While eight students live in the house with Brewster, only three people were home when the suspect entered through a back door off his second-floor patio. According to Brewster, the gate to that area is usually locked, but it was left open on the day of the burglary. He said that the suspect then entered through an unlocked sliding door.
The suspect then broke into Brewster’s bedroom door by picking the lock and stole a laptop, iPod and a camera valued at about $700. The suspect also took two laptops from another bedroom and the living room.
Brewster said that his cleaning crew saw the suspect while he was in the house and asked if he was employed by the landlord. The suspect replied that he was an electrician and quickly left through the main floor entrance.
One of the workers in the cleaning service caught the suspect on video with his iPod as he was leaving. The worker questioned the man one last time, but the suspect maintained that he was an electrician.
When one of the residents realized that his laptop was gone, the suspect had already left the property.
Brewster said that the residents reported the burglary to the Metropolitan Police Department, which wrote a police report and sent over a crime scene investigation unit. Brewster also sent officials the video, but has not received any updates
Brewster partially blamed the incident on a failure to remain vigilant and lock doors.
“I think people get pretty lazy about it,” Brewster said. “Day-to-day, it’s pretty easy to lose track of the reality.”
Chapman said that the burglary at her residence took place some time between 2 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. on March 3. She said she was gone for the day, and upon her return at about 6:30 p.m., she immediately knew that someone had been in her room.
Two laptops were stolen from the apartment, one from Chapman’s room while her roommate was sleeping. Chapman believes the suspect entered through an unlocked window on the ground floor of the building.
She also said that her iPod, which was on her desk next to her computer, was not taken.
Chapman reported the burglary to the Department of Public Safety and MPD. DPS did not have a comment at press time.
Chapman said that DPS did not report the crime because it was not confirmed as a break-in.
Brewster is suspect that the burglaries are linked. He said he is hoping that the video will help identify the suspect and said that he has reason to believe that the suspect had been in his house before. He said that his entrance through the second-floor patio was unusual and that the house had been broken into over the summer.
Brewster also said that another student house in the area was burglarized on March 3, an incident that could be linked to those at both his and Chapman’s residences.
A Georgetown resident told The Hoya that her house at 33rd and Prospect Streets, a block away from Bank Street, was burglarized on March 11 during the day. A laptop and jewelry were stolen. The burglary was reported to MPD and DPS.

Georgetown Cupcake is not all sugar and sprinkles, according to its student neighbors, who say the noise, traffic and trash generated by the popular M Street bakery have left a bad taste in their mouths.
As the popularity of the cupcake shop, featured on the TLC reality show, “DC Cupcakes,” has grown, so has the line that winds around the corner and down 33rd Street.
For neighbors, this means a nearly constant crowd on their doorstep during business hours. Kitty Lichtenstein (MSB ’12), who lived around the corner from the bakery last summer, said the customers were a constant presence.
“The lines would wrap all the way down the block and onto Prospect [Street], and it was ridiculous if you were trying to get somewhere,” she said. “It was just really annoying to deal with the crowds that were constantly there.”
Sophie LaMontagne, co-founder and co-owner of Georgetown Cupcake, said the store is well aware of the potential consequences the large crowds may have on the surrounding community and works hard to ensure that no problems arise.
“One of our staff is always stationed at the entrance to our shop to greet customers, answer their questions and manage the line so that customers are respectful of neighboring businesses and residences,” LaMontagne said.
But Max Stoiber (SFS ’11), whose apartment lies next to the bakery, said that the lines often encroach upon residential space.
“Customers sit on the stairs and block your way when you are trying to get to your house,” he said. “But the people in the line are very courteous and always very friendly.”
Federico del Bono (COL ’12), who lives on 33rd Street around the corner from the cupcakery, said that the line blocks entrances to his apartment and exits from the complex’s garage. Del Bono added that the store does not dispose of its trash properly, often storing it in his complex’s garage.
“I think we have a rat colony living with us now,” he said.
Students have also cited concerns about the noise levels generated by the crowds.
“I think the noise definitely is bothersome. It makes it hard to sleep in because it is very noisy and the little kids are yelling,” Stoiber said.
Some students have turned directly to Georgetown Cupcake’s proprietors to resolve the issue.
“We’ve been asking them now for seven months to do something about it,” del Bono said.
So far, he said that the neighbors have not gotten much of a response to their complaints.
“One of our neighbors got free cupcakes once. That’s about it.”
LaMontagne said that the store has not had any problems with disruptive customer behavior.
“Our customers are peaceful and quiet, and we’ve never had any issues ever with rowdy behavior,” she said.
LaMontagne added that Georgetown Cupcake aims to be an active and respectful member of the neighborhood.
According to some students, the perks of living near the store have been slim.
Del Bono said that six months ago Georgetown Cupcake neighbors were able to buy cupcakes, but recently the lines have become far too long to even try.
Jason Milliken (COL ’11), who lives at the corner of M and 33rd streets, has also tried to reap the benefits of living so close to the famed location by getting one of the free cupcakes last year, but he was only successful on wintry days when the lines are relatively short.
“[It] would be nice if there was a little bonus for us as their neighbors,” Milliken said.
Lichtenstein, who moved to another house for the academic year, will live next to Georgetown Cupcake once again next year.
“I am going to be living right around the corner from them again, and I am not looking forward to it,” she said.
Del Bono said he is fed up with living next door to the bakery and will seek different housing next year.
“I am actually moving out,” del Bono said. “Because I am tired of it.”

The Office of Student Housing announced in an email Monday night that a summer-long revamp of the Nevils apartment complex will start this May.
“Improvements will include new heating and cooling systems, lighting and windows; complete renovations to bathrooms and kitchens; and updates to the fire alarm system,” Patrick Killilee, director of Housing Services, wrote in the email to current Nevils residents, adding that furniture in the apartments will also be replaced.
The redesign of the complex, located at 36th and N streets, will be the latest large-scale renovation to occur in an on-campus residence hall since the removal of asbestos from Darnall Hall rooms last summer. According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, Nevils was last renovated in 1984.
The university said that students living in all four sections of the building, which can house about 435 residents, must relocate by May 16 in order for facilities to complete the project by the fall of 2011. Non-senior residents must head out by May 15, a day after final exams end.
For the 54 seniors living in Nevils, the May 16 deadline falls on the Monday of Senior Week, just days before they will don their graduation robes on commencement weekend. According to Killilee, seniors will be relocated to on-campus apartments — to be assigned in early May — with the help of moving trucks.
Many Nevils residents in their last semesters on the Hilltop said the shift only adds to the frustration they have experienced with their living conditions this year.
Cristina Cardenal (COL ’11) said that her apartment has a mouse problem, an oven which does not have a working temperature gauge and a leaky ceiling.
“We live in shambles — Nevils needs to be fixed,” she said. “We just don’t understand why it has to be in our last six days here.”
Jason Kestecher (COL ’11) said that moving out of his apartment is one of many inconveniences he has dealt with while living in Nevils. These problems included broken furniture, a power outage in January and loss of heat for a period of time during the winter, he said.
Cardenal and Kestecher are both concerned that this renovation, and its side effects, will affect the way some seniors view their soon-to-be alma mater.
Cardenal said that she believes certain Nevils seniors may not be as willing to give financial donations or visit campus after the interruption of their final days on the Hilltop.
“It is insulting to be treated this way. It is definitely going to affect how we look back on our senior year,” she said.
Though he will not let the relocation define his own Georgetown career, Kestecher said it may affect other students more strongly.
“It’s like a little bit of a bad taste that remains in your mouth,” he said.
Pugh said that students have to move out early in order to ensure that all renovations can be made in a timely manner.
“The inconvenience of an early move out is necessary since every day and multiple shifts are required in order to complete the renovations before students return to campus for the fall semester,” Pugh said in an email.
But for many of next year’s Nevils residents, the updated facilities will only add to the excitement of living in an apartment-style environment.
“I’m excited because Nevils feels like a real house,” said Kris Kagei (COL ’13), a current Henle resident who will be moving to Nevils next year. “And having everything newer and cleaner, it just makes me more excited about being a real person even though you are still at school.”

A small but growing core of students is looking to make Georgetown an incubator for big ideas.
The group of 15 undergraduates at the helm of HoyaInnovation are hoping to transform students’ visions into tangible change at the university.
“We all agree that students at Georgetown have lots of ideas and, yet, I don’t think we have a culture that cultivates executing those,” HoyaInnovation member Jamil Poonja (COL ’12) said.  “We don’t act on them.”
The group plays a middleman role, offering students who want change on the Hilltop a gateway to the administrators, alumni or financial backers who can help them make it happen.
“If you are a student and you have an idea, you don’t necessarily know where to go,” core team member José Arredondo (MSB ’11) said. “I see us almost as a medium or a channel. It is like this link between the students, the community, the university, the alumni and the D.C. area.”
Michael Wang (MSB ’07), special assistant to Christopher Augostini — the university’s vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer — works closely with HoyaInnovation. Wang said the group is selecting alumni from successful enterprises, such as Google, Goldman Sachs and ZipCar, to serve on its board of directors.
Prominent alum Tim O’Shaughnessy (MSB ’04), chief executive officer and co-founder of the social buying website LivingSocial, offered his support for HoyaInnovation in an infomercial that ran at halftime during the men’s basketball matchup against Syracuse.
The core team consults regularly with faculty from the McDonough School of Business and plans to bring a wider pool of professors and alums into the fold.
From mobilizing students to serve the off-campus community to assisting students in obtaining more value for their used books, HoyaInnovation is looking to help students tackle various challenges, according to
Poonja.
The team is also working to enhance the international experience at Georgetown. Members want to establish a firmer connection among students who studied abroad in a particular location, students interested in travelling there, faculty that work in the region and students who are natives of the area.
In an attempt to inspire dialogue about technology around campus, HoyaInnovation became a co-sponsor of TEDxGeorgetown. This series of 18-minute talks on the transformative power of the Internet tomorrow will feature professors, students and alumni, including the group of alums who founded the successful local business Sweetgreen.
A VIP reception held by HoyaInnovation after the event will offer students the chance to exchange innovative ideas on technology with the speakers.
The group is working toward creating an interactive website, tailored specifically to the university, to further increase the scope of idea exchange. The website will be connected to social networks, allowing students to submit posts from Facebook or Twitter accounts.
By launching a mobile platform, the group hopes to increase the ease with which students can share their thoughts. Those interested can text idea proposals to the number 82257 and receive messages from HoyaInnovation in return.
“Our goal is to promote a culture of innovation, where people aren’t afraid to think big about changes they want to make to Georgetown or changes they want to make in the community,” member James Li (MSB ’13) said.
Li is leading the arrangement of a Georgetown ThinkLab, gathering 30 to 40 students to join in a three-hour long brainstorming session. Participants will share their thoughts and solutions to a specific campus problem or issue.
Poonja and fellow team member Jose Madrid (COL ’14) are also introducing a roundtable discussion powered by young voices as part of a project inspired by President Obama’s call in February for 100 student-led talks to occur at colleges across the nation.
“We see this as an opportunity to focus on a few issues and an opportunity to have the White House involved in the discussion,” said Poonja.
The roundtable will offer 15 students the chance to discuss relevant university-based topics with a to-be-determined senior U.S. government official.
Madrid said that, though HoyaInnovation is still evolving to suit the needs of its audience, he believes the organization will make a long-term impact on the future of Georgetown.
“HoyaInnovation’s spirit is going beyond the everyday things and doing more,” he said. “It is bringing out the best in people and the community.”

Local chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union launched a campaign against the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s random bag search policy last month and are now considering a legal challenge, according to the Washington Examiner.
“Random searches on our regional public transit systems, which accommodate millions of passengers annually, will whittle away the rights of those citizens while giving only the illusion of safety and one of its worth,” the D.C., Maryland and Virginia chapters of the organization wrote in a letter to the WMATA published on the ACLU website.
The ACLU has been trying to arrange a meeting with Metro leaders since December, when WMATA started the bag search program. On Feb. 28, the organization announced its plan to “derail the Metro Bag Search Program” on its website.
Johnny Barnes, executive director of the ACLU for the District, said that WMATA’s program is expensive, ineffective and violates passengers’ rights.
“[Searches without suspicion] are making millions of passengers guilty until proven innocent,” he said.
Barnes added that the program is a violation of the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendments.
“We at the ACLU believe that Americans can be safe and free, but we don’t believe we can be safe if we are not free,” he said. “Making the Bill of Rights the first casualty of war means those who would do us harm are winning.”
For now, the ACLU’s campaign is limited to educating riders about the program and their opposition to it.  According to Barnes, the ACLU is also planning a public forum on the issue for some time in April.
But the organization is also taking steps toward suing the transit authority and is looking for potential plaintiffs for the case.
“We’re taking any information from someone who’s been stopped and searched,” Barnes said. “The courts frown upon searches without suspicion.”
Mark Stern (COL ’13), the events director for the College Democrats, supports the ACLU’s campaign.
“I think the ACLU has a very strong case here,” he said. “You have police trying to search people with no probable cause, with no suspicion. That’s illegal. that’s unconstitutional — that’s not allowed.”
Representatives of WMATA and the Georgetown College Republicans could not be reached for comment.

The International Relations Club heard from one of its own when Erin Conaton (SFS ’92), undersecretary of the Air Force, discussed everything from the marriage proposal she received from Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi’s best friend to the value of mentorship at their general membership meeting Monday night in White-Gravenor Hall.
Conaton, a member of the IRC throughout her four years at Georgetown, emphasized the formative role the club played in preparing her for her current profession.
“I feel like I’m still using skills from IRC in my current job today,” she said. “Model U.N. lets you know not only what you want to do, but how you want to do it”.
After experimenting with a career on Wall Street, Conaton pursued her foreign policy leanings in a job with the U.S. Commission of National Security and eventually became the staff director for the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Armed Services.
“If you’re going to work 18 hours a day you better love what you’re doing, or you’re going to be a really miserable person,” she said.
In her current job, Conaton focuses on the organization of the Air Force’s budget and deficit reduction.
Conaton’s experience and success serve as an inspiration for current IRC members, according to club chair Eitan Paul (SFS ’12).
“It was interesting to see her translate her experiences from the IRC to help develop her career,” he said. “For example, some of the negotiating skills she developed from doing Model U.N. helped her with negotiating on Capitol Hill. It was a useful and unique opportunity for us.”
Conaton stressed that students should find a good mentor while in college and then continue to give back that sense of connection.
“Make sure you pay it back to the people coming behind you,” she said.
After her talk, Conaton opened the room up to questions, some of which were answered by Lieutenant General Christopher Miller, deputy chief of staff for strategic plans and programs for the Air Force, another attendee.
The situation in Libya was also fodder for discussion. Miller and Conaton were quick to stress the reserved role of the military in the conflict.
“We can, and we are, keeping Qaddafi’s planes from taking off from the ground,” Miller said.
At the end of the meeting, Conaton honored the IRC by bestowing her personal challenge coin — which each Air Force member receives one of — upon Paul. The gift, a tradition in the military,  serves as a source of morale, as members are often “challenged” to be sure that they are carrying their coin.
Conaton presented the coin as an award for outstanding service.
“I was humbled and honored,” said Paul. “It’s really inspiring to see alumni, especially of the IRC, still connected to the university, giving back and sharing their experiences with us.”

Georgetown University’s Catholic Campus Ministry will expand this August, when Jennifer Reis assumes the newly created position of Director of Catholic Retreats and Immersion Programs.
Reis, currently the campus minister of retreats, spirituality and prayer at Emmanuel College in Boston, will be assuming an unprecedented role in the Georgetown community.
Although she was not actively seeking a new job, Reis felt called to the position when it was presented to her, stressing the role of Georgetown’s campus atmosphere in her decision.
“I have to say I felt so very welcome. There was a really great sense of hospitality that was shown my way,” she said. “My first hope is [to] get to know the Georgetown community.”
Reis will be partially filling a vacancy left by Catherine Heinhold, former director of Catholic Chaplaincy and director of retreats, who left Georgetown at the end of the 2009-2010 academic school year. Heinhold was also the creator of the spring break in El Salvador immersion program. Following her departure, Campus Ministry decided to create the new position in order to better manage the multiple responsibilities that Heinhold’s job entailed.
“To be more realistic about a new person at Georgetown, we decided to change the job description,” said Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., executive director of Campus Ministry.
The search committee, comprised of Campus Ministry leadership, began reviewing applications this January. After narrowing down the pool, three applicants were brought to campus in late February to be interviewed before the Catholic Chaplaincy leadership, the Campus Staff Ministry, Campus Ministry Interfaith members, a panel of students and O’Brien.
The search committee’s decision was based on the candidates’ personal experiences with college campus ministry and retreats, their passion for working with students and their own senses of faith.
“A really important thing for the people of the selection committee was that the candidates be steeped in Ignatian spirituality,” said Kevin Kuehl (SFS ’11), the undergraduate student representative on the formal search committee.
Kuehl was chosen as part of the committee because of his continued involvement in Campus Ministry retreats. He also works in the retreat office, which he said helps him better understand the logistical workings of Georgetown’s programs.
Both Kuehl and the members of the student panel who interviewed Reis stressed the importance of the new director reaching out to students who are not generally attracted to Campus Ministry and empower those already involved.
“When you’re creating a new position, you need to be innovative because this has never been done before,” said Marya Pulaski (COL ’13), a member of the student panel that interviewed the final three candidates. “This person should try to give a new energy to Campus Ministry and broaden the group of students it serves,” Pulaski said.
Reis was ultimately chosen because of her extensive experience in developing retreat programs at Emmanuel College and her emphasis on collaboration among the different religious sects of Campus Ministry as a whole, according to O’Brien.
“All were impressed by her innate kindness, sensitivity and openness to others,” he said. “I was also impressed by her desire to build an inclusive ministry, welcoming to all.”
O’Brien added that he hopes Reis will stimulate the further growth of Georgetown’s retreats in numbers and format, as well as possibly creating another immersion program.
Campus Ministry is currently reviewing applications for the Director of Jewish Chaplaincy, the Director of the Protestant Chaplaincy and the Director of Liturgy and Music. These positions will be filled by May 15.

Student volunteers will be knocking on doors and informing their peers living in residence halls about voter registration this Monday through Thursday, but it will not be for national elections. Rather, the students aim to convince students to register to vote in the District so that they may take on a more active role in local politics.
As registered voters, students can play an bigger role in politics by voicing their opinions on neighborhood issues such as those surrounding the campus plan and noise violation laws, according to DC Students Speak Chair Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13). DC Students Speak is spearheading the drive.
“We do not believe that positive change for D.C. students can come until they vote in the city where they spend the majority of their time,” Stirrett wrote in a blog on the DC Students Speak website.
According to Ricky Garza (SFS ’13), a member of DC Students Speak, the drive has registered 50 students within the last week and is aiming to register at least 1,000 total.
In addition to their efforts on the Hilltop, DC Students Speak will hold awareness events on the campuses of several other of the District’s 20 colleges and universities, including The George Washington University, Trinity College and American University.
Jake Sticka (COL ’13), who is one of the student volunteers, is registered to vote in the District and has taken on a role in local politics as the student representative on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E.
“So few [students] are registered voters here, so our issues aren’t the issues being listened to,” Sticka said.
Students’ issues will gain more recognition if students are more involved in elections, according to DC Students Speak member Andrew Klemperer (SFS ’13).
“We are hoping to have a part in the election and make [the ANCs] more responsive to our interests and overall to all to the interests of students in the D.C. area,” he said.
Sticka also emphasized that students should register to vote in D.C. for the time they attend school in the District as patterns of low turnouts in elections mean that students can have a major impact on the outcomes. Although a person may not be a registered voter in both D.C. and another state, it is legal to change registration from one state to another.
According to Garza, one of the goals of the drive is to get more students elected to ANCs.
“One of the most striking things is that 17 percent of D.C. is students and there are only two students on the ANC,” he said. “I’m registered and I’m excited to get other students re-registered.”
Sticka cited the 1996 Campaign Georgetown, when a tremendous number of students voted and were able to sway the election of students onto the ANC.
“Every single student vote does matter, especially in D.C.,” Sticka said.
The next election in which the new voters will be eligible to participate will be held on April 26 for a seat on the D.C. Council.
“The upcoming election should expect 20,000 voters, and 2,000 votes could change an election like that,” Sticka said.

As Cory Peterson’s SNAP car rolled along the streets of West Georgetown at a steady 10 miles per hour — orange lights flashing and windows rolled down — students on foot recognized the vehicle’s familiar presence.
“SNAP is everywhere tonight,” a young woman said to her companions.
One of the university’s two Student Neighborhood Assistance Program cars started its shift at 11:25 p.m. on Saturday. In the car, Peterson, area coordinator for Village A and upper-classmen areas, and a Department of Public Safety security officer at the wheel got back to the night’s patrol, accompanied by Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Jeanne Lord.
SNAP, a service provided by the university to address security and noise issues in off-campus residences, combs the area surrounding campus every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m.. The crew approaches “problem” houses with high noise levels or visible security threats and responds to complaint calls made by neighbors to the SNAP hotline.
Peterson observed the crowds of students along his route and explained that when deciding when to approach a house or group of students, he takes stock of suspicious individuals, open doors and open windows, as well as a high volume of sound.
He said that safety is of the utmost importance when on duty, and emphasized looking for open windows and doors.
Lord also said that safety is the primary goal of SNAP.
“The first goal of SNAP is to enhance safety in the neighborhood,” she said. “It’s a resource for students as well as the neighborhood.”
Peterson said that while SNAP does respond to complaints, more often a SNAP member looks to prevent a call from neighbors by pinpointing loud homes and asking residents to cut back on noise levels.
“I would say we try to be more proactive than reactive, and it’s really to the students’ benefit,” Peterson said.
If he is able to speak to students and warn them about their rowdiness, he can help them avoid interaction with Metro Police Department and the potential arrest that would result from violating the recently amended noise law.
At 11:52 p.m., music and loud conversations were emanating from an illuminated townhouse. Peterson and the DPS officer walked up to the doorway and had a brief conversation with one of the residents of the home. Peterson informed the young woman that she and her friends could be heard from a block away, recommending that they quiet down. Then Peterson wrote up a report on the incident.
SNAP team members write up a report for every house they visit, but punitive measures are not necessarily the next step for students. The Office of Off-Campus Student Life calls in students to determine whether disciplinary measures will result; SNAP members have no say in the matter.
“I actually don’t have anything to do with the punitive side of things,” Peterson said. “All we do is document it if there is something to document.”
As Peterson and the security officer left the doorway, the female resident they spoke with thanked them and told them to have a good night. The exchange took about two minutes, and the party was allowed to continue in a subdued manner.
Peterson said students often express gratitude after SNAP team members speak to them. “I find that most students are happy we’re talking to them and not MPD,” he said.
At 12:30 a.m. — now switched to a different car with Lord, a SNAP team member and LGBTQ program coordinator Matthew LeBlanc and another security officer — they patrolled the streets of Burleith. The neighborhood has less foot traffic, which made it easier to hear noise emanating from gatherings on the open back porches and carrying down the narrow streets.
After a 12:40 a.m. call, LeBlanc said that the students were cooperative, as is typical of his calls.
LeBlanc said the residents he spoke to were cooperative and helped to communicate the situation to the other students.
“There’s very few times that we have to explain what to do. They know why we’re there. By the time I reached the door people were putting on coats and hats, getting ready to go,” he said.
Back in the car at 1:05 a.m., the SNAP phone rang.
LeBlanc answered, “Georgetown University SNAP, this is Matt, how may I help you?” He listened to a neighbor reporting a loud party near 37th and O Streets, and the SNAP car headed to the location. LeBlanc again approached the back of a home and asked the guests of the gathering to leave.
When LeBlanc returned to the car, he explained that while each case of a potential noise violation is judged individually, generally at around 11 or 11:30 p.m. SNAP team members stop giving warnings to students at gatherings and begin asking that the party be disbanded.
As the SNAP car pulled away, a young man walking with a group of companions sang a short song with the single lyric “SNAPs” accompanied by a few finger snaps. The two SNAP cars provoked a range of responses from students throughout the night; a few waved or said hello, while others made jokes or derogatory remarks and a few just ignored the vehicle. LeBlanc said he is used to a mixed response from students walking by.
“There are times when students will say very mean things to us as we drive by. It doesn’t bother me,” LeBlanc said. “And then sometimes I’ll see a student on the street and make eye contact, he’ll nod, and I’ll nod, and they recognize I helped them out the night before. And there’s a mutual respect there.”

On Friday, 110 members of the Georgetown community learned how to save a life when they were registered as bone marrow donors at the Get Swabbed, Georgetown University! event.
The donor drive, held in the Village C West Alumni Lounge, was sponsored by DKMS, the world’s largest bone marrow donor center.
Bone marrow donations are used to help patients with leukemia, other blood cancers and fatal autoimmune diseases make new red blood cells. Matches are often difficult to find since they are based on more than eight different tissue characteristics.
Friday’s drive was the latest in a series held at colleges nationwide by DKMS Americas, an offshoot of the German nonprofit organization started in 1991. Georgetown previously held a drive in 2007, and the Public Policy Institute ran one in September.
According to the DKMS Americas website, the organization overall has registered over 2.6 million donors to date. Forty-two percent of DKMS Americas’ registered donors are between the ages of 18 and 22 — the age of a typical college student.
While this does not mean that all of these individuals donate their bone marrow at that age, Kelly Taylor, a donor recruitment coordinator, stated that younger people tend to be favored as donors.
“If a doctor really has the option of more than one donor for a patient, they just want someone who’s young and healthy,” she said. “It’s these young people who are really the ones saving lives, so it’s ‘How do we get more of them on the registry? How do we save more lives?'”
Such statistics greatly influenced Irene Kim’s (SFS ’14) decision to become a registered bone marrow donor last week. After researching the donation procedure, Kim decided that most students carry misperceptions about the pain associated with the process.
“I’m not really scared about anything,” she said. “I think it would be kind of exciting to donate and save someone’s life.”
Caitlin Emma, a senior at the University of Connecticut who is taking classes at Georgetown through the Fund for American Studies Capital Semester program, registered with DKMS her freshman year of college. Two years later, she was contacted by the organization and told that she was a match for a young female patient.
“It was a little scary at first,” she said. “It unnerved my parents a lot. … It took like a week or so of talking about it and understanding what it meant and what the next steps were and things like that before we felt comfortable.”
Emma underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the most common method of bone marrow donation, in February 2010. The procedure lasted about six to eight hours and was painless aside from side effects including giddiness and fatigue.
Although Emma has not met the patient who received her marrow, they have exchanged letters and Emma has released her information so that the girl can contact her in the future if she so wishes.
“I would say that it’s probably the greatest thing I’ve ever done — probably the easiest thing to do in the world with the highest pay-off,” she said. “It really takes nothing to register as a donor and to give of yourself to someone else.”

Dean Timothy Barbari will take over as director of the Science, Technology and International Affairs program within the School of Foreign Service and the College, effective Jan. 1 of next year.
Barbari, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and associate provost for research for the main campus, will succeed professor of demography Elizabeth Stephen, who has served as STIA director since 2007.
The STIA program focuses on the study of health, energy, the environment, security and development, a curriculum that is founded on the historical, political, economic, cultural and social elements of global studies.
Stephen said she was satisfied with the program’s expansion during her tenure.
“STIA is an incredibly unique program, which I have been really honored to participate in. It translates science into technology and technology into science,” Stephen said.
Stephen will continue to teach and is planning on becoming more involved in the Asian studies program. She will be conducting research with money from a grant awarded by the Academy of Korean Studies alongside professors Victor Cha, Michael Green and Christine Kim.
As a chemical engineer, Barbari has the ability to directly strengthen the hard science element built into the STIA curriculum, according to Carol Lancaster, a dean of the SFS.
“He will bring to the leadership of STIA the training of a scientist combined with an interest in international relations and science policy and a passion for education,” Lancaster said.
Barbari is particularly excited to return to working with undergraduate students.
“Watching students develop a sense of who they are and where they want to go and helping them along that path is the most gratifying part of being a faculty member,” Barbari said in an email. “STIA, with its highly interdisciplinary nature, will be particularly so.”
Before assuming his role, Barbari will be on research leave at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, under the co-sponsorship of the National Bioenergy Center and the Strategic Energy Analysis Center.
Dan Mathis (SFS ’13) enthusiastically spoke of Stephen’s support and value. Mathis highlighted the development of the STIA e-portfolio program, which enables students to visualize and document their academic growth and facilitates the accessibility to academic records.
Barbari emphasized that he is not planning to undertake any immediate changes in the program.
“My primary goal would be to build strategically on what already exists and to do so by listening to what the many stakeholders in the program: Students, alumni, employers, faculty, staff, graduate and professional schools have to say about how it can be even better,” he said.

Student resistance against the recent amendments to the noise law escalated when members of Georgetown Student Government Association created the new Stop Crime Not Parties movement.
Members of the organization have created an anti-noise law website, ordered 100 lawn signs and hope to meet with city officials including Mayor Vincent Gray, according to co-founder and GUSA Senate Speaker Adam Mortillaro (COL ’12).
Co-founder Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), chair of the GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee, expressed optimism about student support and involvement.
“Students are tired of being bullied by the neighbors and [the Metropolitan Police Department]. I’m confident they will support this movement,” Malkerson wrote in an email.
The movement began when members of the Georgetown University Student Association met with university administrators requesting information about how the new noise law is impacting students and off-campus residence life, according to Mortillaro. Officials recommended that GUSA collect formal documentation about the law’s implementation, and the GUSA senators thought of creating a website, Mortillaro said.
The law, implemented Feb. 1, states that unreasonably loud, disruptive noise between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. is punishable by 90 days in prison, a $500 fine or both.
The website launched Sunday evening, according to Mortillaro. GUSA Technology Director Ben Goldhaber (SFS ’12) developed the site.
“This website is an attempt to not only raise awareness among the community but also gain information about how students are affected by these types of disciplinary actions,” Goldhaber wrote in an email. “The website is one part of the larger movement to ensure fair treatment for students and to mobilize students to advocate politically on these important issues.”
The group hopes to begin distributing  lawn signs this weekend, according to Malkerson. The signs read “Stop Crime Not Parties” and are subtitled “We’ve Been Here Since 1789. How About You?” and also gives a website at which students can “report inappropriate police, DPS, SNAP and neighbor activity.”
Malkerson said that a number of students have ordered signs already and pointed to the use of signs as a reaction against signs being put up by Georgetown neighborhood residents in opposition to the university’s 2010-2020 Campus Plan.
“The neighbors have their signs, but we want to show that we have even greater support with our own,” Malkerson wrote in an email.
Stop Crime Not Parties has also opened a complaint file with the American Civil Liberties Union, according to Mortillaro.
Mayor Gray’s office has also expressed interest in meeting with the group, and Mortillaro said that they hope to meet with Gray and other city officials within the next few weeks. The focus of the meeting, Mortillaro said, will primarily be gathering information about the noise law’s origins and implementation.
“We just want to see what this means and act accordingly,” he said.
Mortillaro also said that the group has been in touch with DC Students Speak and university officials, both of whom have been very supportive. Associate Vice President for Communications Julie Bataille said that the group is acting independently of any university office.
“Students certainly have the right to express their views about laws that have the potential to impact them,” Bataille wrote in an email. “University administrators have expressed our views of the recently enacted noise law … and continue to monitor its enforcement.”
Though both Mortillaro and Malkerson are GUSA senators, Mortillaro said that Stop Crime Not Parties also includes students who are not involved with GUSA. GUSA recently passed a resolution in support of the movement, but it is not a GUSA program, Malkerson said. He emphasized that no student money is going towards the group and that it is being funded by private donations.
In his capacity as GUSA Speaker, Mortillaro also signed a Feb. 23 letter from the D.C. Student Alliance to Mayor Gray expressing concern about the noise law and soliciting a meeting with Gray. Representatives of the University of the District of Columbia, American University, Catholic University of America, The George Washington University and Howard University also signed the letter.
D.C. Student Alliance Executive Director Andy MacCracken said that he views the move as an opportunity to build relationships between different D.C. schools as well as between universities and the District government.
