Georgetown dropped in The New York Times’ rankings of colleges doing the most for low-income students, falling from 46th to 88th among the 179 schools on the list, released Sept. 16.
Launched in 2014 by The Upshot, the newspaper’s politics, policy and economic analysis section, the rankings are based on the number of students who receive federal Pell Grants, the graduation rates of those students and the average tuition cost for low- and middle-income students. Pell Grants typically go to families making less than $70,000 a year.
For Georgetown, the rankings reveal the Pell Grant share is 12, the net price for middle-income students is $16K and there is an $84K endowment per student rate.

In the second year of the rankings, The Upshot included colleges with a five-year graduation rate of 75 percent or higher, whereas the cutoff last year only applied to the four-year graduation rate, including only 90 schools versus this year’s total of 179. Each school is given a College Access Index, a figure derived from the number of Pell graduates and the net price for middle-income students.
A college with an average score based on these two factors would receive a score of one. Scores of higher than one indicate that a school exerts above-average effort in these areas, with the University of California-Irvine topping the list with a score of 1.91. Georgetown, along with six other schools, including Colgate University and the University of Southern California, received a score of 0.95 this year.
In an article accompanying the rankings, Upshot Managing Editor David Leonhardt wrote that economic diversity has stagnated at many top universities because university leaders refuse to prioritize it.
“Officials at other top colleges, for their part, often say that they want to enroll more of these talented low- and middle-income students. But only some colleges have followed up these words with actions,” Leonhardt wrote.
Director of Georgetown Media Relations Rachel Pugh attributed the university’s significant drop in rank to the increased number of schools on this year’s list.
“The change in methodology this year nearly doubled the amount of schools that made the rankings,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Computed as percentiles, we actually improved, going from the 52nd percentile to the 49th. In reality, not much changed other than the methodology itself.”
However, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon suggested Georgetown’s drop in rankings could be a result of the university’s low endowment and struggle to raise money for scholarships.
“The lack of a deep pool of endowed scholarships or a very large amount of current dollars coming in makes the financial aid office have to be pretty strict in how they award the money,” Deacon said. “You would think admissions would not be so involved in raising money for scholarship, but we’re very concerned about that. That’s the most difficult part of our ability to compete out there — the fact that we are not as generous as many of our competitors are in financial aid.”
The endowment per student of the other six schools that match Georgetown with a 0.95 College Access Index varies substantially, from Emory University’s $382,000 to the University of Connecticut’s $13,000. Georgetown falls on the lower end of this spectrum with an endowment per student of $84,000, the second lowest in this group of seven.
Despite Georgetown’s rank in the College Access Index, Deacon said that the success of Georgetown graduates should incentivize low-income prospective students to apply.
“When you look at outcomes, if you get to Georgetown, you are likely to do well on the other end,” Deacon said.
Associate professor Marcia Chatelain said that Georgetown has room for improvement in attracting lower-income students.
“I think we’re in a time of transition right now,” Chatelain said. “There is still a ways to go to make Georgetown more accessible to people from all backgrounds.”
The Georgetown Scholarship Program is tailored to help students receive financial aid and the support necessary to succeed at Georgetown.  As of November 2014, the GSP provided financial aid for 625 students from all 50 states and nine countries. GSP Director Missy Foy said she is unconcerned by these numbers.
“I’m not losing sleep over it because I know the real story,” Foy said. “That being said, I’d love to see more socioeconomic diversity at Georgetown, and I think that’s the goal of most university leaders. We continue to work at it.”
Ariana Sadoughi (SFS ’19), a work-study student, said that she valued the hard work of the Office of Student Financial Services.
“The people who work in the financial aid office are really helpful and they really do try to help you the best that they can,” Sadoughi said. “Not only just by giving you the money, but by explaining to you all your options with loans and everything.”
Sadoughi added she was unsurprised at the news that Georgetown had dropped in The New York Times rankings.
“To be honest, coming to Georgetown, I had heard that their endowments are really low for financial aid,” Sadoughi said. “So I kind of figured that it would be this way.”
According to data relased by the National Association of College and University Business Officers and the Commonfund Institute, Georgetown is ranked 66th in total endowment for universities nationwide as of January 2015.

George Akerlof, an economics professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy, released “Phishing for Phools,” co-written with Robert Shiller of Yale University, Sept. 22. The co-recipient of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, Akerlof served as a visiting scholar at the International Monetary Fund from 2010 to 2014. His career in teaching began in 1978, and he taught at the London School of Economics and the University of California, Berkeley before joining Georgetown’s faculty last year.
In his book, Akerlof argues against the idea that economic markets solely provide citizens with material well-being and can actually harm more than help. “Phishing for Phools” is Akerlof’s second collaboration with Shiller, after 2009’s “Animal Spirits,” which also examined economic policy making, but on a macro level.
In an exclusive interview with The Hoya, Akerlof discussed the economic ideas in his new book and how his experience in academia influenced his work.
What are the main ideas of your book and what are you trying to convey?
Economics is mainly about equilibrium. Psychology is about how we mainly make dysfunctional choices. So what this book does is combine psychology and also sociology with the notion of equilibrium, and we discover that there is another serious problem with Adam Smith and that is that people make those dysfunctional choices. … Markets are very efficient if we know what we want, but they also give us what is not good for us when we can be tempted.
What would you say the main thesis of the book is?
The main thesis is that this basic ideology that markets should just be able to let us choose also fails to take into account that markets will also tempt, dupe, manipulate us into making choices that are not good for us, so long as there is a profit to be made.
You have been an economics professor for a very long time. How do you feel like your time in academics has contributed to your book?
This book is really aimed at what economics is. I think when I first began as an assistant professor at Berkeley teaching economics, they emphasized what is known as general equilibrium theory, and at the time I don’t think that I really appreciated general equilibrium theory, but being there and knowing that this was something that people took seriously actually led what to I think is the key idea of the book. The key of the book is to go back to Adam Smith, who says that markets are essentially good for us. This says that there is an important codicil also is that markets will do is that they will fool us and manipulate us as long as they can make a profit out of us. You don’t see economics writing about this.
For the past 50 years American economics have been very similar in policy. Would you have changed any of those? And clearly we are now in a very different type of economy. What economic ideas should account for the economic theory that you put out?
The original title of the book, before we got “Phishing for Phools,” was  going to be “Common Sense.” We used to have economics which was rather pragmatic. If there was something that you would need, you would look at the costs and look at the benefits. … You did something if you thought it was going to work. Unfortunately, I think we have come to view government as a problem rather than a solution. Now, government may not be a perfect solution. We don’t have perfect solutions to all of our problems. We work toward them by a sort of trial and error and we sort of get there.
The view of the book is that over a very long period of time, over the whole progressive era, that we evolved solutions to problems that were better than having no government involvement at all. These things make major, major, major differences in people’s lives. One example is social security. There’s environmental regulation. There is regulation of businesses in all kinds of ways. There is the national highway system. Regulations regarding employment, which means that they are nondiscrimination. The list goes on and on and we all depend on this, but the thing is that we depend on them so much that we tend to take them for granted. … So my view is that we should appreciate what we have. That government insofar as it should play a role does play a role and we should act cautiously so that it continues to work.
Is there anything else you would like to add?
The more I am here at Georgetown, the more I admire the Georgetown community and the values that it has. I think that this book is supposed to be basically about. The book is about going back to the values of the Georgetown community where people care about each other. That is a very important aspect of an economic system that works right. That says that I can do anything and then you go out and whatever markets allow is going to in some sense need all of pulling together to help each other, and that’s not just the government, but is everybody. It’s government. It’s businesses. It’s all sorts of people, and I think that’s what Georgetown is all about.

World Health Organization Director General Margaret Chan discussed the responsibility of governments and international organizations to address global health issues Friday in Gaston Hall at the second Global Futures Initiative lecture of this semester.
The event, entitled “Governance, Global Health, 21st Century Challenges,” continued the semester’s series topic of the future of global governance.
Vice President for Global Engagement Thomas Banchoff, who leads the Global Futures Initiative, began the event by connecting the topic of the lecture to the Sustainable Development Goals approved by the United Nations last weekend.
“Health connects to so many of the other goals, ranging from the elimination of poverty to the achievement of gender equality,” Banchoff said. “They are issues with a strong justice dimension that involve governance challenges at the local, national and international levels.”
University President John J. DeGioia then introduced Chan’s achievements in guiding the WHO through multiple health crises in her current position, which she assumed in 2006. Prior to her involvement in the WHO, she navigated the responses to avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome as director of health in Hong Kong.
Chan began her discussion by stressing the importance of the government’s role in managing potential health threats, citing the misusage of antibiotics, vaccine refusal and the industrialization of food production as examples over the past century.
She then pointed to the danger of current health threats, many of which are tied to economic growth.
“Instead of diseases vanishing as living conditions improve, socioeconomic progress is actually creating the conditions that favor the rise of noncommunicable diseases,” Chan said. “Economic growth, modernization and urbanization have opened wide the entry point for the spread of unhealthy lifestyles.”
Chan said that health issues have significant implications on other aspects of livelihood.
“Health is related to nutrition. Health is linked to the environment. Health is also linked to water and sanitation. We need to think of a comprehensive, integrated approach to address the complex multiple challenges the world is giving us,” Chan said.
Chan also emphasized the necessity of collaboration between government offices and the community in overcoming health issues such as obesity.
“Ministers of health look at the medical evidence. They look at the science. But ministers of trade and finance often listen to other voices,” Chan said. “The health sector acting alone cannot protect children from the marketing of unhealthy food and beverages.”
Chan said that individuals should pressure their governments to pass legislation that prioritizes the health of their citizens, praising the efforts of Australian lawmakers who pushed for plain tobacco packaging.
“What is at stake here is nothing less than the sovereign right of a nation to enact legislation that protects its citizens from harm,” Chan said.
In addition, Chan said that the governments of countries need to work together to combat global health challenges.
“The newer threats to health also lie beyond the traditional domain of sovereign nations,” Chan said. “In a world of radical interdependence, all of these threats are transboundary. The globalized marketing of unhealthy products respects no borders. … Drug-resistant pathogens travel very well internationally. They don’t need visas.”
Chan acknowledged the failings of the WHO in providing an immediate response to the Ebola crisis in late 2013.
“The Ebola outbreak shattered the notion that a disease of poor African nations will have no consequences elsewhere,” Chan said. “The WHO and the international community were too slow to recognize the explosive potential of the outbreak. The world as a whole lacked the adequate response capacity.”
Chan said that in the aftermath of global disease outbreaks, the WHO has worked on incentivizing countries to act together in solidarity.
“The tension between sovereign states and being a good global citizen as part of global solidarity is a tension we need to address,” Chan said. “I put together a list of countries to come together and look at the International Health Regulations [to create] incentivizes for countries to report early, support for countries to build capacities, and disincentivizes for governments who overreact.”
In a question-and-answer session that followed her speech, Chan said that the Ebola outbreak was an indicator that the WHO needed to reform its practices.
“We did not invest in our capacity and our preparedness for huge outbreaks, especially in fragile states,” Chan said. “We did not anticipate the challenge. We need to change that.”
Shashank Rai (GRD ’17) said that he enjoyed the connections Chan made between health and governance issues.
“The talk really put things into perspective for me as a public policy student,” Rai said. “It created an understanding of how important some of these issues could be. The lecture followed up on previous governance issues, which is more important than just having an understanding of health.”

When Janine Karo (COL ’19) walked into her host’s apartment in Arlington, Va., for dinner Sunday evening, she did not have the faintest idea of what to expect.
Over a meal of pasta, she exchanged pleasantries with her host, an alumna interning at the Department of Justice, and six complete strangers from the Georgetown community: a graduate student, a sophomore Arabic major, two self-proclaimed theater geeks and a freshman who had graduated high school in Hong Kong.
By the time the guests were presented with a dessert of homemade brownies and pumpkin spice macarons, Karo felt at ease. The small talk had dissipated and evolved into peals of laughter over an impersonation of one guest’s professor’s French accent, gripes about the bureaucracy behind student employment and speculation about who was behind Dinner With 7 Strangers, the secretive organization that had brought them all together.
While the current coordinators of DW7S maintain their anonymity, the initiative, which organizes dinners for six guests and a host who sign up through its website, has nonetheless gained traction since it first launched its campaign in late February through Facebook and fliers across campus. DW7S relaunched this year, with invitations to sign up for a dinner put up around campus.
Last semester alone, the coordinators organized three dinners per day at its peak to accommodate more than 500 sign-ups from Georgetown students, faculty and staff. In May, The Washington Post featured DW7S in an article, revealing one of the organization’s founders as Lexi Cotcamp (MSB ’15).
Cotcamp, who now works for Google’s Global Security and Intelligence team in California, attended the functions incognito until the publication of The Washington Post’s feature. Her anonymous successors are tasked with overseeing an operation that is funded by the contributions of private donors.
Cotcamp said she started the initiative to promote inclusivity at Georgetown.
“I created DW7S as a way to invite everyone to the table, from freshmen to seniors, from student to professor, from one friend to another,” Cotcamp wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We understand that Georgetown and its organizations can’t accept every person that applies. But truth be told, we believe any Hoya should have a standing invitation to dinner. ‘You can’t sit with us’ is great in ‘Mean Girls,’ but not so much at Georgetown. Exclusivity isn’t our style.”
Cotcamp said she hopes the dinners are meaningful experiences for guests.
“When I started DW7S, I wanted people to feel something beyond the everyday,” Cotcamp wrote. “The legacy is not in the program, but rather how it compels people to feel something.”
Karo was first drawn to DW7S after her mother showed her The Washington Post’s article, which was published several weeks after she committed to Georgetown. She resolved to attend a dinner upon her arrival on campus in order to bolster her interactions with other students.
“It was really interesting to me to hear about how someone had just decided to make all these students meet, and I just felt that Georgetown’s a big school, and it’s hard sometimes as a freshman to click and meet new people,” Karo said.
Unlike Karo, Zachary Currie (COL ’18) accidentally ended up at his DW7S dinner Sept. 27, filling in for a friend who was originally supposed to attend.
“The [host] really gave me some incredible advice about my years at Georgetown, like ‘Don’t burn any bridges’ or to only follow professors if you like them, not necessarily if you like their class,” Currie said. “It was a great experience because everyone was very nice and genuine.”
College Dean Chester Gillis, who attended a dinner last semester, said that the experience provided him with insights about student culture. Gillis himself regularly hosts dinners for students of the College at his own home, but said that DW7S allowed him to interact with students from the other schools.
“It’s interesting in my point of view because it gives me a clue or a sense about what students are engaged in, what students are passionate about, whether they’re interested in the conversations that we had and even the differences among students,” Gillis said. “As we sometimes say, there’s no singular Georgetown experience, there’s multiple Georgetown experiences for different students in different ways, and those who don’t interact with one another get to live them out on this one occasion.”
For sociology professor Sarah Stiles, who attended a dinner in Burleith last April, DW7S not only fosters a more cohesive community, but also provides a memorable personal experience.
“Mixing up these groups helps develop empathy, which is something we need to move forward as productive members of society,” Stiles said. “Our little bit of Georgetown Hoya culture is just a little bit of the whole, but people need to know how to hang out with people who are different than them.”
Ultimately, Cotcamp said while every dinner is different, each contributes to the understanding that everyone at Georgetown is “cut from the same cloth.”
“I’ve had people break out into song at dinner,” Cotcamp wrote. “I’ve witnessed emotional freshman and seniors with more sass than you can imagine. I’ve had alumni ask if they could celebrate their 50th birthday by attending DW7S. Every dinner is different. That’s the beauty of it.”

Truth Telling Project Co-Directors Cori Bush and David Ragland spoke about their experiences on the frontlines of the police brutality protests in Ferguson, Mo. Friday morning in the Healey Family Student Center.
The event, titled “The Radical Act of Truth Telling: For Ferguson and Beyond,” was organized by the Georgetown chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice, the Justice and Peace Studies Program and the Center for Social Justice.
The Truth Telling Project is an initiative that promotes discussion of structural racism and injustice as a response to the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer in August 2014 and the subsequent civil unrest in Ferguson.
Aside from the project, Bush serves as a pastor at Kingdom Embassy International, a church in St. Louis, Mo., while Ragland is a visiting assistant professor at Juanita College.
The two were inspired to start the project in November 2014 by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a commission set up in South Africa following the abolition of apartheid in 1996.
Bush began the conversation by recalling how the city of Ferguson reacted when news of Brown’s shooting initially broke.
“When I first stepped on the scene it was something like I could have never imagined,” Bush said. “Thousands of people outside in the streets — angry, outraged, not knowing what to do — police dogs, police in SWAT gear. It was a night of horrors.”
Bush said that the protests were a traumatizing experience, which led her to experience flashbacks at the sound of helicopters and dog barks.
“It took me to that combat zone,” Bush said. “It’s in my backyard, streets that I use, officers that I can see if I go to the grocery store and they are in plainclothes. … It’s those people that when they clock in, now those are the ones that have a gun in my face. Those are the ones that are beating my friends.”
Ragland then mentioned how police violence does not align with the principles of democracy.
“It’s sickening that a society that would call itself a democracy would use its military on its own citizens,” Ragland said. “Urban communities in America are under occupation by their own society.”
According to both Bush and Ragland, their participation in the movement came at a personal price. Bush said that she has received violent threats, such as death threats from the Ku Klux Klan, but she said that she refuses to back down in the face of adversity.
“We keep protesting because they keep killing us,” Bush said. “It’s not OK that I have to fight to be free the way a white woman is free. What makes my son different that I have to fight for him to be able to walk out of my home and walk to the corner store and come back safely? Why do I have to fear? That is a reality in my community every day. My son may not come home.”
Ragland called on members of the audience to join the resistance against police brutality.
“Police violence is contingent upon what America approves, and my hope is that the rest of America will begin to understand what happens in some communities and withdraw their consent so that democracy is possible, because police violence wouldn’t happen if white America said we don’t want it to happen,” Ragland said.
Bush also explained how Georgetown students can make a tangible difference in the university community.
“If everybody just here in this university did something, their thing, whatever it is, and used it for social justice … think about how much would change, just here,” Bush said.
Ragland said he was frustrated that the majority of Americans responded passively to the protests.
“America wants reconciliation. America is like, ‘Forgive, shut up and go away,’” Ragland said. “We cannot push people to forgive if they are not ready to, especially if [the police] are still killing us. … America wants to hear ‘I have a dream,’ then go back to sleep.”
Ragland also said reconciliation must involve a direct interaction between the perpetrators and victims.
“It involves a relationship between the perpetrators and the victims. The harm must be repaired and in some cases, reparations should be paid,” Ragland said.
Ragland said that it is important to expose the truth even if it is bitter.
“How do you not be complicit in a society where you breathe and drink in racism?” Ragland said. “We are all complicit to a certain extent in this structure, as victims, in different intersectionalities and in different identities, but we are all complicit in a racist, patriarchal system that is homophobic and prizes money over bodies and persons.”
Eliza McCurdy (COL ’17), an attendee of the event, was struck by the intensity of the discussion.
“It was one of the most real, genuine, terrifying, but inspiring things that I’ve done at Georgetown in three years,” McCurdy said. “It pointed out a lot of the issues that are not only present in Ferguson but are present on this campus that we have yet to address.”
Corrections: An earlier version of this article stated that Bush served at the Kingdom Embassy International in Durban, South Africa and that Ragland was a professor at Washington University. While Ragland has taught courses in Washington University, he is currently a professor in Juanita College.

Forty-six students campaigned over the past week for one of the 28 Georgetown University Student Association Senate seats, for which three districts received no contenders.
The results of yesterday’s election will be announced today.
With seats divided into residence-based districts, this year’s election also included a new senate position for the representative of the Former Jesuit Residence and Leavey Hotel district, which combines the FJR and Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center dorms.
Interest in the senate election was found mainly in the freshman class, with 12 and nine candidates vying for seats in the Darnall-Harbin and New South-Village C West districts, respectively. There were no official candidates for the upperclassmen townhouses and LXR districts, while the off-campus district saw three candidates compete for four seats.
With no official contenders for the LXR district, Musa Bassey (COL ’18) and Harry Halem (SFS ’18) started a satirical campaign to elect former Chancellor of Germany Otto von Bismarck as the district’s senator last Saturday.
This year also saw fewer female candidates, who made up 40 percent of the campaigns, than male candidates.
According to GUSA Election Commission  Vice-Commissioner Grady Willard (SFS ’18), write-in votes have a large impact on the outcome of the election when there are not enough candidates to fill seats.
“All of the districts have spots for write-ins,” Willard said. “If [the leading] write-in doesn’t want to take the seat, they can decline … and we would have to have another special election.”
GUSA Election Commission Chair Alden Fletcher (SFS ’17) said that the absence of upperclassmen in the senate election is offset by their participation in the executive branch.
“[Their absence] is counterbalanced by the executive, which sort of draws heavily from the upperclassmen, and the executive has some ability to put policies forward and make propositions just because it’s more of a unitary actor than the senate,” Fletcher said.
As per previous years, the rules of campaigning pertained mainly to spending, locations of flyers and appropriate hours for door-to-door knocking and meet-and-greets. 
The election commission uses instant runoff voting to select the seats, as students rank their candidates in order of preference. These votes are then tallied and redistributed according to rank, eliminating one candidate each round until the number remaining is equal to the number of available senate seats.
As the year group with the most candidates, freshmen had to vie for recognition, in addition to promoting their campaign platforms.
Vance Vaughan (SFS ’19), a candidate for the New South-VCW district, held meet-and-greets with the slogan “Dance with Vance.”
“I got my name out in the race early and so I do think I have some name recognition,” Vaughan said. “Among the pool of people, there is some pretty stiff competition.”
Rob Kasper (COL ’19), who campaigned for the Darnall-Harbin district, said that he found the competition motivating. 
“It inspires us to put forth even more of an effort and to be more involved,” Kasper said. “To get our name more out there and to think deeper about issues rather than if there were just a few of us.”
Connor Pace (COL ’19), who ran for a seat in the New South-VCW district, said that he drew inspiration to run from events held during New Student Orientation.
“The capture-the-flag event was seminal for a lot of kids because they got to meet students from other dorms and really talk to them, get to know them and form friendships they wouldn’t otherwise have,” Pace said. “I also think that the club culture that is created by Georgetown is not necessarily the most healthy thing because it tends to put people into cliques.”
William Morris (COL ’19), a candidate in the Darnall-Harbin district, agreed that coordination between groups on campus is an important issue.
“I’d like to see interaction between clubs. I’d like to see interaction between dorms,” Morris said. “I’d like to see more friendly coordination between clubs that may even be on opposite sides of issues as opposed to the animosity that you sometimes see.”
Other candidates placed emphasis on issues such as sexual assault policy reform and diverse representation advocacy in student campaigns.
Camion Horton (SCS ’17), who ran for the Village C East district seat, said that she led her campaign with issues of diversity in mind.
“I want to provide a sense of inclusion, a sense of reliability, a listening ear and bring about a voice of reason … on a school-wide basis,” Horton said. “It is 2015, times are changing, people are changing and we have to be able to embrace those differences in things around us.”
Fletcher said that being elected to serve as GUSA senator allows one to become involved in a variety of campus issues.
“Their benefit is that they can definitely claim to represent a specific portion of the student populace, as well as sort of having that connection to a more specific area which makes it easier to direct projects,” Fletcher said.

In the lead-up to Congress’ vote to defund the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Georgetown College Democrats organized a rally advocating for the organization in Red Square on Tuesday, which was met with counterprotestors in support of defunding the nonprofit.
The rally coincided with National Pink Out Day, in which there were national demonstrations and two local rallies in support of the organization outside of the Capitol Building and the Planned Parenthood headquarters.
Planned Parenthood, which has provided reproductive health services since the early 20th century, received national media attention in July when undercover videos were released showing the nonprofit’s officials discussing the use of aborted fetus tissue in medical research. Since then, hundreds of politicians, mainly Republicans, have called for the defunding of the organization.
On Friday, the House of Representatives passed a spending bill that retained funds for Planned Parenthood, averting a government shutdown.
At the rally in Red Square, the College Democrats organized a photo campaign in which students took pictures holding signs showing support for Planned Parenthood. The pictures were subsequently posted on social media.
Vice Chair of the College Democrats Tracey Zhang (SFS ’17) said that the goal of the rally was to demonstrate the importance of Planned Parenthood to a range of demographics.
“There’s been a lot of talk recently in Congress about defunding Planned Parenthood, and we just want to show how integral this organization is to supporting women’s health and to providing services, especially for low-income women who otherwise wouldn’t be able to have access,” Zhang said.
Willem Miller (COL ’17), who participated in the rally and the photo campaign, said that he supported Planned Parenthood because of the variety of health care services it provides for women.
“I feel like people get very wrapped up into one service they provide, which is a very important service and one that needs to be provided for health and safety reasons,” Miller said. “Of course, I’m talking about abortion, but even if you never feel like you could get an abortion personally, that’s not all they do. They do so much else for health care in general.
Another participant in the rally, Sarah Madoff (COL ’16), said that supporting Planned Parenthood should have a special relevancy and urgency for Georgetown students, who often do not have access to the services provided by the nonprofit.
“Georgetown, as a Catholic institution, doesn’t always do as much as it can to support reproductive health on campus. … Especially since our health center doesn’t provide a lot of things that Planned Parenthood does, it’s especially important for us to have Planned Parenthood as an option,” Madoff said.
As the College Democrats rally took place, pro-life student group Vita Saxa staged a simultaneous counterdemonstration in Red Square to show its support for defunding Planned Parenthood.
Members of Vita Saxa held signs that read “Defund Planned Parenthood” and “I am the Pro-Life Generation.”
Justine Worden (COL ’17), a member of Vita Saxa, said that the goal of the counter-rally was to remind students of options other than Planned Parenthood that support women’s health. To demonstrate this, Worden held signs that read “I Stand for Comprehensive Care without Planned Parenthood” and “Women need Love, not Planned Parenthood.”
“We got the signs to show that there’s equal support for comprehensive care without Planned Parenthood and without abortion, so that’s why we’re here,” Worden said. “[Comprehensive care is] everything that Planned Parenthood claims they do, without abortion.”
After the rally, several members of the College Democrats attended the general rally at the Planned Parenthood headquarters on 1110 Vermont Ave. NW, where they briefly spoke with Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards.
Meredith Forsyth (SFS ’19), who organized the trip to the rally at the Planned Parenthood headquarters, said that the College Democrats also set up a marketing initiative to spread awareness about Planned Parenthood.
“Each group would go to a different neighborhood or location in D.C. and do canvassing,” Forsyth said. “We were basically just trying to garner support by getting people to sign up for the Planned Parenthood newsletter and show that they support Planned Parenthood.”
In response to the counter-rally held by Vita Saxa, Forsyth said that while the College Democrats did not agree with its views, both groups had the right to publically express their opinions.
“It’s a free speech space and everyone has the right to be there,” Forsyth said.

The 22-year-old Taste of Georgetown food festival makes its return to the waterfront this weekend, featuring food from more than 30 local restaurants.
The annual festival, hosted by the Georgetown Business Improvement District, will showcase more than 60 dishes from popular eateries such as Baked & Wired, Dog Tag Bakery, 1789 Restaurant and Clyde’s of Georgetown. Each dish costs $5 to taste.
Even with the expected inclement weather with Hurricane Joaquin, the festival will still take place, according to BID Communications Director Rachel Cothran.
“Despite the rain we anticipate on Saturday, we expect a great turnout for the festival. Our location underneath the Whitehurst Freeway means that we’ll be completely covered — one of few events happening this weekend that isn’t cancelled,” Cothran wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Four of the restaurants featuring dishes at this weekend’s Taste of Georgetown previewed their offerings Sept. 24 at their respective locations. The minds behind Olivia Macaron, Chaia, Tony and Joe’s Seafood Place, Eno Wine Bar and Chez Billy Sud were on hand to showcase the dishes that are available to this year’s festivalgoers.
Ana Claudia Lopez, co-owner of Olivia Macaron, located at 3222 M St. NW, said she hopes the French delicacies brighten her patrons’ days.
“If they’re just having a bad day, I hope a little macaron is going to make that day a little better,” Lopez said.
Lopez met her business partner, pastry chef Michel Gaion, after she ordered macarons from Gaion’s online business. Together, they now sell macarons in 14 signature flavors in addition to a rotating set of seasonal flavors. To celebrate the store’s two-year anniversary Oct. 19, Olivia Macaron will feature a pumpkin-spice-flavored macaron and a “jet black mac,” which is flavored with fig and balsamic.
Another featured establishment, Tony and Joe’s, has been a fixture on the Georgetown waterfront for 20 years and is known for its Sunday brunch, featuring live music and bottomless mimosas. In addition to partnering with local charities for restaurant events, Tony and Joe’s also aims to reduce its environmental impact through its membership in an oyster shell recycling program.
Its signature fresh-shucked Wellfleet and Belon oysters are part of its tentative tasting menu for this weekend, as well as yellow fin tuna, monchong and mini corn muffins.
The youngest of the festival’s featured establishments, farm-to taco-restaurant Chaia, has yet to officially open its Georgetown location at 3207 Grace St. NW, but founders Bettina Stern and Susan Simon continue to serve their all-vegetarian tacos from their tent at the Dupont Circle farmers market. Like Tony and Joe’s, Chaia is committed to sustainability and all of its utensils and cups are fully compostable.
All of Chaia’s ingredients are locally sourced, including ingredients for signature kale and potato and mushroom tacos. Though the farmers market tent only sells the tacos, the restaurant plans to also have a wide variety of drinks on tap, including natural juices from Misfit Juicery, a company started by Georgetown students, as well as local beers, wines and shrubs.
An emphasis on local ingredients is also prominent at Eno Wine Bar. The nearly 2-year-old bar, located at 2810 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, does more than just serve wine, with an extensive selection of local charcuterie and cheeses, as well as salads, flatbreads and grilled cheese.
The final featured restaurant, Chez Billy Sud, is also expanding by adding a wine bar in the space next door. The downstairs dining room is intimate and decorated in an old French style, creating a feeling of home within the walls of the restaurant, while the pastry kitchen dominates the upstairs.
Head pastry chef Jonte Hughes, who hails from Atlanta, has been at Chez Billy Sud since the restaurant’s inception.
“In the United States, you don’t see it too often, but here at Chez Billy we like to focus on classic French desserts and French food in general,” Hughes said. “It’s nice to go back and look at what started it all, and kind of embrace it. … You can’t help but appreciate the classics.”

The Georgetown University Medical Center named Susan Cheng the first senior associate dean of diversity and inclusion in August. She is heading a new office focusing on fostering diversity across the institution.
Formerly called the Office of Minority Student Development, Cheng’s office is now called the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.
“The focus is really looking at increasing and cultivating diversity and inclusion among students, staff and faculty at the School of Medicine,” Cheng said. “I’m excited that I get the chance to really impact the school culture at the Georgetown School of Medicine by really partnering with other faculty members and staff, and actually the students, to make it more of a comprehensive approach to diversity and inclusion.”
In the first month of her position, Cheng created the Council on Diversity Affairs, an advisory board comprised of students, staff and faculty members that will give the dean the opportunity to collaborate with other GUMC members on issues dealing with diversity.
She has also established the Innovations on Diversity and Inclusion Team, a program that offers internships in her office that are open to undergraduates. Students will be able to conduct research on new policies that increase diversity and inclusivity.
The program has already recruited Georgetown College and School of Foreign Service students, and has received applications from American University students.
Cheng highlighted the importance of a collaborative effort in developing diversity and spoke of her excitement as she takes on this new role.
“I don’t think diversity lies within just one office or one person. I think it’s going to be embedded in a lot of different collaborations and partnerships amongst offices, and, like I said, faculty, staff and students, to make a very rich community that supports diversity and inclusion,” Cheng said.
Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny expressed the need to reach out to underrepresented students and to fight health disparities.
“The need is still very much there for medical and health practitioners from underrepresented communities to have such educational opportunities,” Kilkenny wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is also important to continue examining how best to eradicate health disparities. I am excited about continuing our work in these areas and I welcome a partnership with Dr. Cheng as we strive to address these common goals and interests.”
Luke Brown (COL ’17), one of the interns on the Innovations in Diversity and Inclusion Team, praised Cheng’s leadership in her new role.
“My hope is that Dean Cheng can use her expertise in leadership development and educational access to foster new ways of recruiting and retaining medical students from historically marginalized communities,” Brown wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Dean Cheng has already begun the process of designing new ways of engaging prospective students, augmenting the services, programs, and student organizations already in place, and incorporating the larger campus in conversations focused on diversity and inclusion.”
Michael Sobalvarro (COL ’16), another intern on the team, highlighted Cheng’s continuous commitment and positive energy.
“Dr. Cheng is very motivated,” Sobalvarro wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have autonomy between ourselves to discuss and execute projects, but Dr. Cheng knows exactly when to chime in, and direct the workflow. She’s like an orchestrator and we’re the musicians.”
Before Cheng, Joy Williams held the role of senior associate dean for students and special programs for 35 years before retiring in July 2014. She established the Georgetown Experimental Medical Studies Program, which sought to bring students underrepresented in medicine into the field. The GEMS has educated more than 400 students, around 80 percent of whom completed medical school.
Dean for Medical Education Dr. Stephen Ray Mitchell is confident in Cheng’s ability to contribute to inclusivity at GUMC.
“Susan Cheng is a remarkable woman who will provide the deserved tribute to the decades of work by Dean Joy Williams to challenge us all to live up to our Jesuit mission of reaching out to all individuals regardless of origins,” Mitchell wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is an exciting time that this remarkable young woman joins the team to maintain this wonderful momentum.”

Georgetown University Law Center, the American Constitution Society and the Campaign Legal Center are establishing a Voting Rights Institute to train both students and attorneys at GULC Oct. 2.
The institute was established in response to the outcome of the 2013 Supreme Court case Shelby Counter v. Holder, in which a provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was voted unconstitutional. The decision has restricted the ability of the government to prevent discriminatory voting practices across the country.
However, although this capacity of the Voting Rights Act has been nullified, section 2 of the Act, which provides recourse for litigation to combat cases of discrimination in voting practices, has remained unaffected.
The launch event will take place at the National Press Club, attended by Georgetown Law Dean William Treanor, ACS President Caroline Fredrickson and CLC Executive Director J. Gerald Hebert.
Treanor emphasized the VRI as a way to take advantage of this opportunity to combat potential abuse of the Supreme Court decision by conducting voting rights trainings for law students and attorneys.
“There has never been a Voting Rights Institute like the one we’re creating at Georgetown Law,” Treanor said in a GULC press release. “In a time of intense concern for and scrutiny of voting rights, the Institute will develop innovative legal and policy solutions that protect the right to vote, while training the next generation of lawyers and leaders. Our goal is to make the Voting Rights Institute at Georgetown Law a hub of thoughtful engagement on all voting rights issues in the U.S.”
The VRI will establish a center of operations for voting rights trainings that the ACS and the CLC have been conducting across the nation for over a year. It will also offer voting rights information to the public, provide attorneys with a resource database and match those seeking legal assistance with attorneys.
VRI faculty will include partners from law firms Jenner & Block and Brazil & Dunn as well as members of the Southern Collation for Social Justice and Open Society Foundations.
The institute received financial support from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Mertz Gilmore Foundation and the Wallace Global Fund.
GULC Vice Dean Jane Aiken highlighted the social benefits of more lawyers gaining expertise in voting rights through the institute.
“[The VRI will] train people in new approaches to voting rights law, and to provide them with a sophisticated understanding of how to bring claims,” Aiken said. “[The VRI will] arm students and lawyers with litigation skills that are transferable to a variety of situations, through cooperation with voting rights experts and access to extensive resources.”
The ACS is a legal organization that provides forums for legal, public policy and media figures to debate progressive public policy.
According to Fredrickson, VRI will be combine the passion of lawyers and students with the expertise of leading figures in the field of voting rights.
“[The VRI will] institutionalize and expand, get more lawyers out in to the field, and equip them to handle cases in the best possible way,” Fredrickson said.
The CLC is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization that advocates strong enforcement of U.S. campaign finance laws.
Hebert emphasized the VRI as an effective response to the challenges produced by the outcome of the Shelby County case.
“Such a burden, with its attendant costs and need for expertise, is overwhelming and has opened the door to unchecked and rampant discrimination,” Hebert said in a CLC press release. “The only solution, short of reversing this decision, is to arm lawyers and citizens with the tools to challenge discriminatory practices and to support them through the inevitable litigation that follows.”
Herbert also underscored GULC’s nonpartisan reputation and expertise as an important characteristic of the VRI.
“We wanted to establish a Voting Rights Institute devoted to one of the most important issues of our time, voting rights for all Americans,” Hebert said. “Georgetown University Law Center was the perfect location for the Institute, because it possesses a well-deserved reputation for academic excellence and is a place where we can focus nonpartisan analysis and constructive engagement on the right to vote, while training the next generation of lawyers and leaders.”
