When government professor Angela Stent arrived at Georgetown in 1979, there were two senior female faculty members in her department. Thirty-four years later, that imbalance hasn’t changed much.
Of the government department’s 53 faculty members, 10 are female, and no women serve on the department’s executive board.
“Our numbers are getting better, but they’re still not there,” Michael Bailey, government department chair, said. “Even now, there will be times when we have a meeting, and there will be no women or there will be one woman, and I do think that if you’re just one of whatever category, it’s probably a little less comfortable.”
A recent article by Barbara Walter, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego, found a particular gender gap in citations in international relations. In a review of more than 3,000 journal articles published between 1980 and 2006, Walter found that articles by men were cited an average of 4.8 more times than articles by women.
The paper was covered by the Chronicle of Higher Education and discussed at the American Political Science Association’s annual meeting in August, which also introduced a paper that found that women take on more committee appointments than men but that their assignments are of a lower stature and a study that found that female professors were evaluated more negatively than male professors as class sizes increased.
At Georgetown, the issue of more work with lesser titles for female faculty is particularly salient.
“Because there are relatively few women in the faculty in general, women actually get asked to do a lot,” School of Foreign Service associate professor David Edelstein said. “There is a consciousness now that we should have women represented in leadership positions. But since there are not as many women as men, you can only ask them to do so much because you want them to be scholars and top-notch teachers and all the rest.”
Over the past decade, hiring female professors has been a departmental priority, according to government professor Andrew Bennett. Though there are few female faculty members, women are equally successful in earning tenure as men in the department.
“I’m not happy with the situation, but I really do think in the past couple of years there has been a big effort to try to recruit female faculty,” said Kathleen McNamara, an associate professor of government.
Two new female professors are set to join the government department: Diana Kapiszewski, who studies comparative law and Latin American politics, began in August, and Nita Rudra, who researches global political economy, will join the university in January.
But the lack of female faculty can be cyclical.
“The problem is when you have so few women, sometimes it’s harder to then attract women because there are implicit ways where they may not feel as welcome if they come to give a talk or when they interview,” McNamara said.
Bennett suggested that political science could be a lesser-known frontier for women.
“To some degree, if you’re the first generation of any demographic group that’s trying to break through the glass ceiling, academia isn’t necessarily the first place you’d think of,” Bennett said. “People who are really eager to break those glass ceilings might break through other glass ceilings first.”
Looking ahead, it seems that women may make advances in political science departments soon. Female students currently make up a majority of Georgetown’s Ph.D. program in government.
“I walked into my first session of my Ph.D. seminar last spring, and I looked around and I realized there were 11 women and zero men,” Bennett said. “We do have definitely a large number of [female] graduate students.”
McNamara expressed hope that this would eventually translate to more female faculty members.
“There is a very healthy pipeline of female Ph.D. students in political science, so it’s not that, somehow, there aren’t qualified women particularly at the junior level, coming through the system, so I think that if we keep chipping away at this, hopefully we can make a difference,” McNamara said.
But without female professors as advisors and role models, it can be difficult for female students to get ahead. When Lise Howard, an associate professor of government, was studying for her Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley, all of her advisers were men.
“They felt uncomfortable asking their female advisees to go for a beer or to go to lunch or dinner. It’s easier for men to ask their male advisees to go out,” Howard said. “My adviser would ask his male and female advisees to go out together, so there are ways of overcoming it. You just have to get creative. But you know that one-on-one beer at the bar between the guys, a lot can transpire in those conversations that are really important for one’s career.”
McNamara agreed and added that female role models at the undergraduate level are also important, especially when students are figuring out which academic path to follow.
“It is really important to have female role models in the front of the classroom,” McNamara said. “It’s good for everybody to see women on an equal footing with their academic male peers.”
Edelstein pointed to the role of history in shaping the department and in moving it forward.
“The important thing to keep in mind is that a department doesn’t get this way overnight, and it can’t change overnight either,” Edelstein said.

To foster U.S.-Czech relations, Georgetown University, in conjunction with the Embassy of the Czech Republic, will honor the late Czech President Vaclav Havel with a memorial in Alumni Square.
The memorial and dedication Oct. 2 is part of the Czech embassy’s Mutual Inspirations Festival, now in its third year, which seeks to highlight the contributions of a famous Czech citizen in an effort to enhance relations between the two countries.
Construction in the northeast corner of Alumni Square began Sept. 9 and is set to continue through next week.
Havel, who died in 2011, was a prominent dissident and human rights activist during the Communist rule of then-Czechoslovakia, authoring plays, poetry and essays. After the fall of Communism, he became Czechoslovakia’s last president before the dissolution of the state and was elected the first president of the newly formed Czech Republic.
He visited Georgetown on his first trip to the United States in 1990 and later returned, appearing at a speaking event in 2005. His close relationship with Georgetown professor and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was born in Czechoslovakia, introduced him to Georgetown and its environment.
“We were privileged to have welcomed Vaclav Havel to our campus throughout the years,” University President John J. DeGioia said. “This was one of the first places in the U.S. where he spoke following the Velvet Revolution, which was fitting — he was devoted to the idea of the university as a place to foster discourse and the free exchange of ideas.”
The embassy approached the university in 2012, prompting a review by senior university colleagues, including Albright, to advise DeGioia moving forward.
“It became clear that there was a real connection here. This was a former head of state, this was someone who was devoted to freedom, this is someone who was an artist and, as the Czechs call him, a modern-day hero,” DeGioia’s Chief of Staff Joe Ferrara said. “There was an intersection between the values that he and his life represent and the values Georgetown represents.”
Ferrara said that Vaclav appreciated Georgetown’s open environment in comparison to the oppression he faced growing up in Czechoslovakia.
“What he appreciated about Georgetown was freedom: academic freedom, freedom of speech, the freedom to talk about ideas and have an open debate and discussion without the fear that someone was going to come throw you in jail because of what you said,” Ferrara said.
According to Embassy of the Czech Republic Cultural Counselor Barbara Karpetová, a special significance lies in dedicating the year 2013 to Havel, as it marks the 77th anniversary of his birth. Havel co-wrote Charter 77, a document calling upon the Communist regime to recognize basic human rights that incurred the wrath of the government.
The university ultimately picked Alumni Square as the home for the memorial, with input from colleagues and the embassy, based on its high foot traffic and uncluttered setup.
The design consists of a linden tree, the national tree of the Czech Republic, in the middle, surrounded by a bench with two chairs attached. The ground will be laid with pea gravel to avoid the accumulation of mud. Concentric circles of bricks, stone and grass will surround the installation, along with a plaque dedicated to the university.
The memorial is sponsored by the American Friends of the Czech Republic, the Embassy of the Czech Republic and the Vaclav Havel Library in Prague.
“We have basically taken charge of designing, constructing it and funding most of it,” AFOCR Founder and Corporate Secretary Robert Doubek (LAW ’74) said. “They look to us to manage the entire project.”
While the American Friends of the Czech Republic will pay the for the architect and contractor work, the Czech embassy is providing the tree and the Vaclav Havel Library in Prague is providing the chairs for the site.
Doubek estimated that the AFOCR’s contribution would measure $20,000, while the library’s provision of the bench would be around $5,000. The university will assume future maintenance costs.
The programming on Oct. 2 will consist of a panel on Havel, moderated by Center for Eurasian, Russian and Eastern European Studies Director Angela Stent and featuring Albright and professor Tomáš Halík of Charles University, in Prague.
The panel will be followed by a procession to the memorial site led by Executive Director of People in Need Šimon Pánek, who was a student leader during the 1989 Velvet Revolution. The Czech embassy will pass out small Czech flags in remembrance of the peaceful demonstrations and freedom.
DeGioia will speak at the dedication, with the Czech Republic Ambassador to the United States Petr Gandalovič and Havel’s widow, Dagmar Havlová, in attendance.
Karpetová, from the Czech embassy, envisioned the site as a “living memorial.”
“The whole idea is that Havel was a man who believed in the truth and free expression,” Doubek said. “It’s generally intended to be part of the university campus … and a lot of people, at least supporters of Havel, would like to come here and see it.”

Fewer District residents may wake up with regrettable tattoos if a D.C. Department of Health proposal to institute a 24-hour tattoo waiting period becomes law.
The DOH regulations, introduced Sept. 6, would govern the body art industry, including safety regulations regarding body piercings in addition to tattoos.
The proposed regulation has not found support among industry professionals like Stacey Gear, a tattoo artist at Champion Tattoos, located at 719 8th St. SE.
“I can’t really comprehend how they would think that they could save people from what they’re perceiving as somebody making a mistake,” Gear said. “It’s just so absurd. It’s hard for me to even verbalize it.”
Bobby Rotten, a manager at D.C. Ink on U Street, located at 1203 U St. NW, echoed that opposition.
“I think it’s crazy,” Rotten said. “There is no actual reason for that. I can’t believe that it’s actually proposed.”
A Sept. 6 Washington Post website poll suggests that disapproval isn’t limited to those who stand to lose a profit. Among 968 respondents, 81 percent opposed the regulation, while only 19 percent supported it.
City officials say the proposal could prevent people from making impulsive decisions that they may regret later.
“We’re making sure when that decision is made that you’re in the right frame of mind, and you don’t wake up in the morning … saying, ‘Oh my God, what happened?’” DOH Spokeswoman Najma Roberts told The Washington Post.
Tattoo artists, however, said that they already take care to confirm that customers recognize the consequences of their decisions.
“We have our customers sign a release form so that they’re well aware of what they’re entering into, and we remind them that, yes, this is a permanent decision they’re making,” Gear said. “It’s no mystery.”
Gear added that reputable tattoo artists often go beyond the waiver’s requirements to make sure customers are happy with their decisions.
“If somebody walks in the door, and they say, ‘I want a tattoo, but I don’t know what I want,’ I tell them to go home and think about it because it’s a permanent mark,” Gear said.
Nevertheless, some think the 24-hour waiting period would be a step in the right direction, especially in preventing drunken mistakes.
“When I first heard about the proposal, I thought it was a good idea. I’ve heard multiple stories about drunken tattoo decisions,” Galen Hiltbrand (COL ’14), who does not have a tattoo, said. “That’s not the type of mental state that you want to be in when making such a permanent decision.”
Nick Barkley, shop manager at Tattoo Paradise, located at 2444 18th St., NW, said that the 24-hour waiting period would not solve the issue. According to Barkley, regret does not always come days or weeks later — it often takes decades before people regret the decision to get a tattoo.
“A lot of people get tattoos at 18 that they don’t regret until they’re 40 or 50 years old,” Barkley said. “Twenty-four hours isn’t going to do anything.”
Gear said that people who are thought to be intoxicated are denied service, an important issue when weighing the proposed waiting period.
The proposal includes other safety regulations, such as requiring all tattoo artists and body-piercers to receive hepatitis B vaccinations and to undergo biohazard training. The regulations would also implement stricter guidelines on the use of needles, inks, gloves and other equipment.
While Rotten agreed with the safety portions of the regulations, he said that the 24-hour wait period was inappropriate.
“There’s definitely a place for regulation. There are plenty of people out there who have no idea about cross-contamination or about how actually dangerous it is to get a tattoo,” Rotten said. “But you shouldn’t be able to regulate how or when to get something on your body. … There is no safety issue that is resolved by waiting for 24 hours.”
The professional community expressed concern about the possible precedent this would set for future laws and regulations.
“They are going to need you to sign waivers before you get that last slice of jumbo pizza, before you take that last shot and before you take home that girl at the bar,” Barkley said. “How far are you going to extend that?”
The proposal is open for public comment until Oct. 6. In the meantime, many body art professionals have organized to express their views.
“All my friends and I are going to proposals and board meetings to speak out against it,” Rotten said.
Some students thought that the District should have more pressing concerns.
“The D.C. government needs to focus on other things like nutrition, inequitable access and the unemployment rate, rather than honing in on what the youth may or may not do to their bodies,” Fahad Abdul (COL ’14), who does not have a tattoo, said.

The Halcyon House — a Georgetown landmark built in 1787 — will enter the next phase of its history this year with the S&R Foundation, a D.C.-based nonprofit.
The foundation, which supports talented individuals in the arts and sciences with a focus on international cultural collaboration, purchased the house — located at the corner of 34th and Prospect Streets — to use as its new headquarters. The property was purchased from sculptor John Dreyfuss for $11 million.
Dreyfuss had inherited the house from his father, architect Edmund Dreyfuss, who purchased it in 1966. Halcyon House was built by Benjamin Stoddert, who was the first secretary of the navy, and Pierre L’Enfant, who designed much of the Washington, D.C. street layout, designed its gardens.
The S&R Foundation plans to use the headquarters for Illuminate, a social incubator program for young entrepreneurs, as well as the International Institute of Global Resilience, a start-up think tank founded in 2012 to provide disaster management research and education.
S&R Foundation Chief Operating Officer Kate Goodall expressed excitement about working with Georgetown, thanks to the proximity between Halcyon House and the university. Goodall said that the foundation may provide educational and research opportunities for graduate and Ph.D. students. In addition, the International Institute of Global Resilience will launch a fellowship program in October, focusing on emergency management and disaster communication, logistics and mitigation.
“Georgetown University has been really receptive and helpful,” Goodall said. “I can certainly see us doing work with Georgetown University in the future.”
Due to the possible increase in traffic, the board of Zoning Adjustment and Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E originally faced concerns from the community about changing the house’s zoning from residential to nonprofit. Many of these concerns were addressed by an agreement between S&R, community members, neighbors and ANC 2E commissioners that was developed over the summer in preparation for last week’s ANC meeting.
By the terms of the agreement, the house will play host to a maximum of 75 events per year, most of which will include small speakers and conferences for no more than 50 people. At last week’s ANC meeting, S&R representatives added that they would plan large-scale events only when students are out of town, which would help alleviate traffic and congestion concerns. There are also plans to build a vehicle turntable to prevent traffic congestion on 34th Street. A vehicle turntable is a rotating platform that turns cars around so that they can change direction quickly without needing to make three-point turns.
ANC 2E commissioner Ron Lewis noted the high degree of cooperation between S&R and the neighborhood community.
“The S&R Foundation was very welcoming of these discussions,” Lewis said at the Sept. 3 ANC 2E meeting. “We have successfully arrived at a very significantly reduced in scope plan.”
S&R representatives, community members and residents who live within Halcyon House’s vicinity all voiced their approval of the revised resolution at the ANC meeting.
“We are very aware that even though we are an international organization, we are embedded in the Georgetown community,” Goodall said. “We look to be really good stewards of the property as well as good neighbors to the community.”
Events at Halcyon House are set to begin in the spring, after the vehicle turntable is installed.

Georgetown moved up one spot to tie for 20th in the U.S. News and World Report’s 2014 college rankings, which were announced Tuesday.
After consistently moving up one slot each year for the last two years, Georgetown shares this year’s ranking with Emory University and the University of California, Berkley. This marks the first time Georgetown has placed in the top 20 since 1999, although the highest ranking Georgetown has held in the U.S. News report was 17th in 1989, 1993 and 1994.
“We are honored to once again be recognized among the leading universities in the nation by U.S. News and World Report,” university spokesperson Stacy Kerr said. “While it is significant to receive strong rankings across all of our programs, we recognize that these studies are only one of the many factors that students use to select Georgetown.”
Although Dean of Admissions Charles Deacon said that the 20th place underestimates the university’s resources, he deflected the rankings’ importance on a larger scale.
“The bottom line is that it’s not a big deal, we tend not to make it a big deal,” Deacon said. “I think if we suddenly dropped off the list it would be an issue, but I don’t think it is a factor.”
Deacon added, however, that the increase would most likely affect prospective students coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
“I think it makes a difference, regrettably, for the least informed,” Deacon said.
In addition, Georgetown’s strong international image is a major selling point for international students, who are also heavily influenced by the annual college rankings. According to Deacon, these students are not as familiar with U.S. universities and often rely on such rankings.
“It’s probably a lot more of an impact because they are a lot more removed from the process,” Deacon said. “Georgetown does have a strong name abroad from the early days of many graduates in the foreign service.”
The rankings were based on peer university evaluations, high-school counselor ratings, freshman retention rate, graduation rate, class sizes, faculty pay and credentials, admissions selectivity and financial resources.
Of all the categories, Deacon said that the high school counselor rankings were most telling, in which Georgetown ranked 12th and received a 4.7 out of 5 point ranking.
“[High school counselors] seem to have a better handle, in my opinion, on what this means for their high school senior class,” Deacon said. “We are much happier to see how they rank us than how the presidents and provosts rank us.”

BeWell Week, which promotes healthy habits and wellness with a series of educational activities for the student body, will expand this year with its kickoff Monday.
The event, in its third year, is sponsored by Health Education Services in partnership with several other on-campus groups, including Yates Field House and Dining Services.
“We’re always looking for opportunities to mention health to students and to help them be aware of the resources we have,” Health Education Services Director Carol Day said. “The week is a fun and engaging way to keep mentioning health and remind them of things they can do that are fun and interesting, and healthy at the same time.”
This year’s BeWell Week will run from Monday to Saturday. For the first time, each day of the week has been assigned a theme, such as “Breathe Well” or “Eat Well.” Most events will feature prizes and giveaways.
According to Student Health Center graduate assistant and part-time health educator Laura Marcucci, Student Health Services staff worked with 20 on-campus partners and five groups off campus to plan this year’s expanded event over the summer.
“In addition to the daily themes, we really wanted to take the events to the next level,” Marcucci said. “Last year, we had a regular 5k, and this year we are having a Crazy Run.”
Other new events include a kickball game on Kehoe Field, a yoga class at Lululemon exclusively for Georgetown students, puppy playtime on Copley Lawn and an alcohol-free BeWell Block Party.
“Many students, particularly freshmen or transfers, aren’t aware of the resources that Georgetown has to offer,” Marcucci said. “However, past evaluations have shown that BeWell Week has helped to increase awareness of these resources. By providing students with ways to take care of themselves and access help when they need it, we can ensure they have a great four years.”
Yates Field House will offer several free fitness classes, as well as free massages. According to Yates’ Assistant Director of Fitness and Wellness Meghan Dimsa, the gym has taken on a bigger role in BeWell Week this year, including making a donation to the event.
“We’re going to be all in this year,” Dimsa said. “It’s really important to give students an opportunity to get involved in fitness and recreation. It puts the focus on health and fitness, so some people who might be intimidated have an opportunity to experience it in a lot of ways.”
The Women’s Center is collaborating with RU Ready and the I Am Ready Campaign to co-sponsor a table that will provide information about sexual assault.
Georgetown Dining Services will also participate by offering tours of O’Donovan Hall and consultations with Georgetown’s nutritionist about eating healthy and meeting dietary needs at Leo’s.
“We want students and customers to be aware of all the healthful options we offer,” Dining Services Marketing Director Adam Solloway said. “We do highlight everything throughout the week as well.”

The housing selection process for rising juniors and seniors will move from early fall semester to the spring, a change designed to reduce roommate conflicts and requests to change housing.
Housing eligibility will still be determined in October, and the points allocated to sophomores, juniors and seniors will remain the same, as will the housing selection process for rising sophomores in the spring. The exact dates for the spring selection have not yet been determined.
Housing points, which have been used only to determine eligibility, will now be used to determine selection times, with the intent of giving upperclassmen better housing options.
Sophomores receive two points, and juniors and seniors who did not live on campus the previous year receive four points, while seniors who did live on campus get three points.
The October housing selection date previously applied to both returning students and transfer students, who had to figure out who to live with and where less than two months after arriving on the Hilltop. Students and administrators hope that the delayed selection date will help students by allowing them to choose living situations at a date closer to the beginning of that year.
Executive Director of Residential Services Patrick Killilee said feedback from students and residential living staff led to the decision to reevaluate the housing selection process. Since last spring, representatives of the Georgetown University Student Association and Georgetown University InterHall have been involved in the evaluation process.
“In surveying students over the past few years, we have asked students if they would prefer a spring selection or retain [the] fall process,” Killilee wrote in an email. “A majority of students have indicated they would prefer a spring selection process, [while] less students were interested in retaining the current model.”
While the administration has engaged students in changing the selection process, InterHall President Nicholas Adams (SFS ’14) highlighted suggestions that have not yet been implemented, including moving up eligibility determination from October, the ability to select housing in tandem with other groups and re-allocating points.
Rising seniors who study abroad during the spring semester of their junior year receive three points for housing, while those who study abroad in the fall semester receive four points.
“We feel that no discrepancy should exist and instead should be equalized,” Adams wrote in an email.
The changes allow students to determine whether they are eligible for campus housing in October, leaving time to also seek off-campus housing, though most students intending to live off campus sign leases by late September.
“We have advocated for moving the eligibility decision to an even earlier date so that students who are not awarded eligibility have more time to find off-campus housing and roommates with whom to live,” Adams wrote.
Megan Murday (SFS ’15), a member of the GUSA Campus Living Advisory Committee, has participated in the discussions about changes to the housing selection system.
“When we were talking about moving the process, we were focusing on the benefits with regard to students,” Murday said. “We decided that having housing selection in the spring would allow sophomores and transfers … more time to make the decision for the following year of housing as to whether or not they want to live with that person.”
Murday suggested that in addition to giving students more time to make a decision, the changes could result in fewer conflicts between roommates and requests to change housing. Adams suggested that the changes will also help students make other decisions regarding study abroad, resident assistant positions or the decision to transfer.
Chris Rom (COL ’16) agreed with the decision to move housing selection.
“Housing arrangements are volatile,” Rom said. “The less time between deciding where to live and moving in, the better. If someone decides to study abroad or take up an internship — those are decisions that could be made in the winter [with the spring selection time] but not with choosing in the fall. But now these are the sort of changes that can be accommodated or planned for.”

To mark the 40th anniversary of the 1973 coup in Santiago, Chile, Chilean folk singer PatricioZamorano performed a concert Wednesday in the Intercultural Center Auditorium.
The event, sponsored by the Department of Spanish & Portuguese, commemorated the coup’s anniversary with a message of historical memory, justice and peace.
The concert began with a video juxtaposing images from Sept. 11, 1973, the day that set Chile on a long road of regime breakdown and human rights violations, and the Sept. 11 attacks against the United States. The video quoted the line “History is ours and it is written by the people” several times.
Government professor and former Undersecretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Arturo Valenzuela delivered the keynote address. He called upon the audience to reflect on the coup that marked the end of one of world’s longest-lasting democracies.
“There’s been much more reflection than ever before,” Valenzuela said. “Memory is so crucial. It is so important to recapture and recuperate what happened. For it is only through the truth and justice that we can truly know what happened.”
Zamorano performed a set of several folk songs, accompanied by drum, guitar and flute players. He dedicated the concert to all heroes, past and present.
The songs were intended to reflect pride in the beauty of Chile and hope for its future.
“The land of the nation is sweet,” Zamorano sang in the lively opening song.
He explained how he chose to focus his music not as much on the political aspects of the coup, but rather on honoring the human costs.
“When we forget to honor revolution, we are no longer human beings,” Zamorano said.
Zamorano’s performance was well received.
Nico Lake (SFS ’16) said it was a moving experience.
“As a Chilean-American, it was a great opportunity to be able to attend a program combing the two historic events that have made this day so important,” he said. “It was also nice to hear the folk band liven up the commemoration with traditional Chilean music that isn’t heard much around Georgetown.”
Mary Rogers (COL ’16) agreed that the music was a refreshing way to commemorate what is typically a more somber memory.
“I really liked all aspects of the event,” she said. “I felt like I wanted to get up and dance.”

Elizabeth O’Bagy (COL ’09, GRD ’13), a researcher whose analysis of Syria had been quoted by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Secretary of State John Kerry, was found to have falsely claimed to have a Ph.D. from Georgetown this week.
O’Bagy, who did earn a master’s degree in Arab studies, was fired from her position as an analyst for the Institute for the Study of War on Wednesday after the group confirmed she had lied on her resume.
“I believe that we, as an institution, have the responsibility to represent ourselves and our work accurately to one another and to the public,” ISW President Kimberly Kagan said. “That is why we publish long reports with documentation and biographies of our authors. And so, it is simply unacceptable to me that any employee should misrepresent his or her credentials.”
O’Bagy began as an intern at ISW while she was simultaneously earning her graduate degree from Georgetown. She was officially hired as an analyst last year after the alleged completion of her doctorate program.
According to ThinkProgress, O’Bagy originally told her ISW associates that she was in a combined masters/Ph.D. program and writing her dissertation on “Female Militancy in Islamic Extremist Organizations,” but ThinkProgress found that the professor who was supposedly advising her dissertation had never heard of her.
Moreover, at Georgetown, the master’s program in Arab studies partners with three departments for joint doctoral programs: government, history and Arabic language, literature and linguistics. There is no record of O’Bagy on any of the three websites.
Georgetown government professor Daniel Nexon, who served as the director of admissions and fellowships for all but one of the years O’Bagy could have applied for the program, told ThinkProgressthat there was “no evidence that she is associated with [the government] department in any way.”
Kagan would not comment on how the falsified academic record was discovered, but the recent attention around O’Bagy’s work with Syria caused increased scrutiny on O’Bagy, particularly when her work was cited by Kerry and McCain.
A discussion started Sept. 9 between a group of scholars, including Georgetown faculty members, regarding O’Bagy’s alleged Georgetown credentials, Think Progress reported. The experts were skeptical of her records, and a participant allegedly expressed the intent to contact ISW with the group’s concerns.
Kagan stressed that she was impressed with the fact that O’Bagy confessed to her in person.
“Elizabeth told me herself [Tuesday]. I confirmed, and I terminated her employment immediately,”Kagan said.
Kagan added that, despite O’Bagy’s deception, she still held a high level of respect for the researcher.
“I have an extraordinary degree of admiration for Elizabeth’s work ethic and her capabilities, and I sincerely hope that she will succeed,” Kagan said. “She is an outstanding researcher and incredibly hardworking analyst, and her work that she had published at ISW is extremely impressive and well-documented. I stand by her work.”
Following her termination, O’Bagy told Buzzfeed that she was no longer legally allowed to discuss her employment or affiliation with ISW.

GU Pride’s board will now include a representative for trans* students, a position formerly absent from the group.
The group voted unanimously to establish the position Tuesday. The newly elected board member, Celeste Chisholm (COL ’15), is an out transgender woman.
“Being the first student at Georgetown is interesting for me because I know more people in the past would have done it if there was any sort of precedent,” Chisholm said.
The position was created after GU Pride’s board decided to prioritize the rights of the queer students of color and transgender students in the coming school year. The only other specified position on the board is for an ally representative.
“It became clear to us that for the first time we have several out trans* students who might be willing to be on the board,” GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) said. “We thought this was the perfect time to recruit one of them and give the trans* community a chance to be more visible and prominent within Pride’s structure.”
Shiva Subbaraman, director of the LGBTQ Resource Center, said she was energized by the new position in light of how difficult it can often be for trans* students on Georgetown’s campus.
“That is something to celebrate. The truth is, on this campus, it has been very difficult for gender non-conforming members,” Subbaraman said. “We have had gender non-conforming students before but often did not feel safe or empowered enough to take leadership on this campus.”
For Chisholm, this board position will mark the first time that she is putting herself into the spotlight as a transgender female.
“This is my first year really being involved in GU Pride. It’s tough being out there in the spotlight,” Chisholm said. “I’m just tumbling through my existence, and I just happen to be knocking into glass ceilings as well. To me, it’s just a matter of having the confidence to be yourself.”
Though no out trans* student has yet to graduate from Georgetown, two out transgender students ran for the position Tuesday night.
“This is the first time we have more than one non-gender-conforming person out on campus who are willing to share their lives with us,” Subbaraman said. “Having her and other students here who are out now give a face to this issue, which has been abstract until now.”
Lloyd said the election reflects a growing desire for trans* students to establish a place for themselves on campus.
“There being two out trans* students who both want to become more visible demonstrates that the community has definite needs and desires to change the university — it’s ready to move forward and organize to make being trans* at Georgetown easier for everyone,” Lloyd said.
Chisholm noted that, while she can often pass for a female, resisting complacency is an important part of representing the community of trans* individuals.
“There’s this false dichotomy of people that pass and people that don’t,” Chisholm said. “I quickly realized I was slipping into that habit of being someone that didn’t want anything else but normalcy. I realized I had a responsibility to be there for other people, like paying it forward.”
For all that she hopes to accomplish as a GU Pride board member, Chisholm boils her goals down to raising awareness of the experience for transgender individuals on the Hilltop.
“Once a person is introduced to a transgender person, people are pretty accepting once you have a face and a voice you can attach to the concept,” Chisholm said. “I think a lot of it will be putting it in people’s faces for the first time, allowing Georgetown students to see that this is totally normal and establishing a safe environment for us here.”

Student insurance at American University will now cover full transitional care for transgender students, including gender reassignment surgery, making AU the only Washington, D.C. university to cover such costs.
The new AU policy will cover 80 percent of the cost for gender reassignment at in-network providers and 60 percent at out-of-network providers, with a maximum of $500,000.
At Georgetown, it is not likely that these procedures will be added to university healthcare.
“We review our student health insurance on a regular basis, with a focus on meeting student needs, respecting our Catholic and Jesuit identity and adhering to local and national law,” university spokesperson Stacy Kerr wrote in an email.
Due to the small size of Georgetown’s transgender community, GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) said that it would be difficult to push for coverage expansion.
“I think that the recent hype over contraceptive care could be instructive — under directives from the federal government, Georgetown might change its policy — but Georgetown still has a ways to go on transgender issues,” Lloyd said. “The out transgender community is fairly small, so there isn’t a huge population calling for a change in policy. From a large student push, a change might be possible. … Helping someone be happier and healthier in their body needn’t conflict with the Jesuit mission at all.”
Lloyd added that the recent addition of a gender non-conforming representative seat to the GU Pride board was a step in the right direction, especially considering that an openly transgender student has never graduated from the university before. Lloyd said many students come out following graduation but keep silent during their studies at Georgetown.
Personally, Lloyd said he believed that the university should cover gender reassignment costs for transgender students.
“Personally, I say absolutely. This … is an established right in some countries,” Lloyd said. “For some people who identify as transgender, the ability to transition is essential to their mental health and identity. They don’t feel at home in their person, so the ability for them to transition successfully and being supported is key to their health as an individual.”

More than 30 students showed up at the Georgetown University Student Association senate election information session last night, preparing for the Sept. 19 campaign kick-off and Sept. 26 election.
GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) encouraged attendees to review and campaign on current campus issues particular to their interests.
“Being a part of the student government will show you the best of Georgetown but at times show you the worst of it,” he said. “However, it will be a great chance for you to engage your passions and change things for the better.”
This year’s election, however, will run slightly differently than previous ones. In a bill unanimously passed by the transitional GUSA senate committee Sunday, districts with more than one seat will run under a single transferable voting system, instead of an instant runoff voting system, which was used in the past elections.
The new system uses preferential voting in multi-member constituencies, requiring candidates to reach a certain share of quota votes instead of a majority of votes to be elected, as was the case under the old system. After a senator is elected by reaching the designated threshold, surplus votes are then transferred in accord to their ranking preferences to other remaining candidates.
Election Commission Chair Ethan Chess (COL ’14) stressed that altering the voting system will not lead to significant changes in election results.
“For the majority of the time, STV will produce the same results as IRV,” he said. “But when it doesn’t, it produces a better and more representative result.”
The alteration of the voting system follows up on the 2011 redistricting reform, which combined certain districts into jurisdictions with multiple member representation in order to ensure each district was a similar size.
“This is the last step for us to getting us our electoral map and procedures to where it should be,” he said.
Chess said that the old IRV system did not produce the most desirable results for districts such as Darnall and Harbin Halls, which is one district represented by three senators. Southwest Quad representation was similarly problematic.
“In single districts, [it] makes sense,” Chess said. “But in multiple districts, a better system to give more consistent result is STV, because IRV looks only for the one preferred candidate but ignores support relative to one candidate versus another, which is important in districts looking to elect three or four or more representatives.”
If the referendum petition on the university’s consideration of a satellite residence is deemed valid by the Election Commission, the referendum will be held concurrently with the senate election Sept. 26.
The referendum, proposed by the “One Georgetown, One Campus” campaign, is an up-or-down vote and asks students, “Do you support a satellite residence for Georgetown undergraduates?”
Because the referendum appears as the first on the ballot page, followed by candidates for at-large seats and candidates of the individual student’s own district, Tisa expects to see larger voter turnouts.
“What we’ve seen in the past years, when there’s a referendum question on the ballot is a boost on the turnout, which is good for our system, good for our participation and good for student engagement,” he said.
