With the passing of the May 1 deadline for high school seniors’ college decisions, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions has seen an increase in the number of admitted students accepting their places at Georgetown.
This year’s higher yield means the university has admitted fewer students from the waitlist, offering admission to 99 students so far compared to more than 200 last year, according to Charles Deacon, dean of undergraduate admissions. In 2008, 80 applicants were accepted off the waitlist; the year before that, 20 were admitted off the waitlist, and in 2006, 60 students.
Though final yield figures will not be available until the fall, as students still need to respond to waitlist acceptances at Georgetown and other schools, Deacon said he believes the commitment rate will improve.
“Early returns suggest that we will probably end up accepting 100 to 150 fewer than last year to enroll the same size class so the yield will likely be better by 1 to 2 percent, but we won’t know for sure until the end,” Deacon said this was reflective of the university’s appeal to accepted students.
“The yield has improved even though the competition among schools is higher than ever and the economic issues families face still remain,” Deacon said.
Yield rates have also remained high at other colleges. Harvard College’s rate is above 75 percent this year, and it will admit as many as 75 students off the waitlist. Dartmouth College’s yield was 55 percent, and there may not be room to accept any waitlisted students. The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill offered 350 spots to waitlisted students this year, according to The New York Times. No peer schools have experienced a serious decline in their yield rate, despite the economic downturn limiting some students’ ability to pay tuition.
There was also a notable jump in the number of black students who have accepted their offers of admission at Georgetown. This year, 135 students chose to attend Georgetown compared to 101 from last year. 8 percent of the accepted students this year were African-American. In contrast, 9 to 10 percent of last year’s accepted students were African-American.
Deacon said this increase could be due to the increased number of scholarships available from the Georgetown Scholarship Program. Over 70 percent of the students offered GSP scholarships are first-generation college students. Last year, the GSP offered 50 scholarships to incoming freshmen, but this year, there are 150 available, according to Deacon. The students who were offered these scholarships have a higher yield rate than the rest of the applicant pool.
“Increased fundraising through the 1789 Scholarship Imperative and the Georgetown Fund for this program will be a major factor in our ability to continue to improve the diversity of the class and the yield on admissions offers in the years ahead,” Deacon said.
The 1789 Scholarship Imperative, launched in 2009, aims to raise $500 million in funding for GSP by 2014. One can donate to the 1789 Scholarship Imperative through the Georgetown Fund. Seventy percent of the class of 2010 that donated to the Georgetown Fund chose to direct funds toward improving financial aid.
Deacon also noted that one or more admitted students from every state except North Dakota have accepted their spots in the Class of 2014, in addition to students from 46 different foreign countries.”

During its final week on the Hilltop, the class of 2010 is marking its farewell to Georgetown with communal reflections, a number of ceremonies, a comedy night and Senior Ball, among other events.
Programs in this year’s Senior Week, organized by the senior class committee, were aimed at allowing students to explore opportunities they may have missed in the past four years, be they lectures with favorite professors, tours of D.C. or bonding more with fellow classmates.
“Senior Week is focused on celebrating the class of 2010 as a collective. It encourages students to reflect on and commemorate their entire time as a Hoya, not just the senior year experience,” Christine Conforti, chairman of the board of the senior class committee, said in an e-mail.
“The bittersweet aspect of the week is what makes it so meaningful and fun. Relationships with friends, classmates, professors and everything else `Georgetown’ are constantly growing, even during our last week on the Hilltop,” Conforti said.
Attendance has been high at all the events, according to Conforti, with the Reggae at McDonough Gymnasium and DJ Leo’s Dining Hall events drawing more than 1,000 seniors each. Other especially popular events were the President’s Picnic and the Class of 2010 Fund Wine and Cheese Formal.
Although attendance at events where alcohol is served is generally high, the planners have tried to diversify the programming this year and host more educational and religious events, as well as non-alcoholic entertainment events. One of them, a trip to Sandy Point beach, was cancelled due to rain, but other than that the week has proceeded smoothly.
Students praised the range of events offered.
“Although I don’t think all the events of the week are superb, there seems to be something for everyone, which is good,” Drew Peterson (SFS ’10) said.
Ashley Wilson (MSB ’10) has attended every event other than the trip to Six Flags last Saturday.
“I think it is a really great ending to Georgetown because you kind of ignore the fact it’s ending soon since so much is going on,” Wilson said. “Also you get to see people you might to forget to say goodbye to.”
Seniors also noted that they are looking forward to the Senior Ball, which will take place tonight at Union Station.
While students have enjoyed the events, one concern raised was regarding an insufficient distribution of information about Senior Week events.
“The Senior Class Committee Web site has been pretty awful at updating information on events other than Senior Ball,” Peterson said. “Next year’s SCC should do a better job making the Web site a truly useful resource.”

Every summer, Georgetown students from far and wide stay on campus, exchanging surfing lessons for international finance classes, trading ice cream for research fellowships and swapping the 4th of July at Nobadeer Beach for fireworks over the Washington Monument.
The location is the main draw for students interviewed, who said the employment opportunities in the District are simply unparalleled compared to those in their home states: Some intern on Capitol Hill, while others pursue more specific causes.
Deven Comen (COL ’12) said she doesn’t enjoy a breadth of internship opportunities at home like that in the Washington area.
“I live in a rural town in Connecticut. It has such limited opportunities for employment and lacks the resources of D.C. This summer I’m working at the [U.S.] Treasury, researching for a professor and am involved in different jobs on campus like working at Senior Week and Reunion Weekend,” Comen said.
Paige Lovejoy (SFS ’12), will be working at a consulting firm that handles stability training for military servicemen in combat zones.
“There is not very much to do in Ohio [where I’m from] that relates to my professional interests. In addition to this opportunity to work at a consulting firm, I will also continue to work part time at the [Berkeley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs],” Lovejoy said
Other students, like Savannah English (SFS ’12), will work within Healy Gates. English will serve during June and July as controller of Corp Accounting.
“Doing something like this is a perfect opportunity to be here in Georgetown, and also to enjoy myself without the pressures of homework and school,” she said.
any students, however, return to their studies through the warmer months. For athletes, the season offers a chance to catch up on time lost due to practice and competition schedules. For others, it’s a chance to focus on particularly demanding coursework.
Lindsey Bragg (MSB ’13), who rows for the women’s open-weight crew team, will be taking a course at Georgetown this summer.
“This past semester was very difficult for me,” Bragg said. “I had practice, races and took five hard classes. I decided that over the summer, I would take one class so that next spring, when I have practice every day, I could take fewer classes.”
Lauren Bakios (COL ’09), spent her sophomore summer on the Hilltop taking organic chemistry, a requirement for students on the pre-med track.
“I took organic chemistry over the summer because it is a very demanding course, and since it was my only class, I could really focus on learning the material and doing well,” Bakios said.
And students remaining on campus over the summer will not have to do without many of the resources they are accustomed to during the school year.
ost Corp services, including Uncommon Grounds, More Uncommon Grounds, Vital Vittles, Hoya Snaxa and Corp Catering will continue operations during the summer, though some with abbreviated hours. Only The Midnight Mug in Lauinger Library will be closed, according to The Corp Web site. Yates Field House remains open as well as O’Donovan Hall. Leo’s offers meal plans that can be purchased by the week, in a program running from June 5 to August 13.
For students who plan to cook their own meals, Safeway recently re-opened on Wisconsin Avenue.

In the chaos of moving out of Georgetown for the summer, Project Hilltop is aiming to save all of the usable items that students are willing to donate. Project Hilltop, started through Residence Life, is a group of resident assistants, hall directors and residents committed to improving the working space on Georgetown’s campus and increasing Georgetown’s sustainability.
So far for the Move Out Drive, according to McCarthy Hall Director Jess Buckley, the volunteer coordinator and adviser for the Move Out Drive, Project Hilltop has collected and donated 10 fridges, 30 lamps, eight boxes of small electronics, 30 various pieces of household furniture, 20 boxes of food, 15 boxes of school supplies, 40 plastic storage containers, about nine boxes of books, about 30 bags of linens and 100 bags of clothes.
“The purpose is really twofold – first, we want to reduce the trash we produce at move out; second, we want to place reusable items with people in need in the city,” Buckley said.
With over 80 volunteers and multiple campus partners, Georgetown’s overwhelming support and donations have been essential to making this drive work, according to Buckley.
“From providing funds to feeding and giving T-shirts to volunteers, to supplying boxes and bags for the drive, to publicizing volunteer needs to their communities, to offering use of trucks and drivers, to providing space and approval for the process, many campus partners have been key,” she wrote in an e-mail.
The donations will go to Pathways to Housing DC, New Endeavors by Women, Community Family Life Services, Interfaith Clothing Center, N Street Village, Catholic Charities and other organizations suggested by students. The main connection to these groups for Project Hilltop was Valerie Johnson, the president and founding director of KEYS for the Homeless, who helped to organize the drive so it best suited these organizations with wish lists, encouraged KEYS partners to participate in the Move Out Drive, communicated logistics, served as a point of contact for the committee to communicate information about the drive to KEYS partners and worked with committee on public relations and media efforts to promote student involvement for a successful Move Out Drive.
“The invitation for nonprofit organizations to be welcomed on campus and participate in the student Move Out Drive offers abundant resources of basic household goods to meet real life needs. Executive directors, case managers, care providers and staff are deeply grateful for the recognition and support of their dedicated work in the community,” Johnson said in an e-mail.
“I personally think it’s great Residence Life even with all of their projects during the year is still able to do this at the end of the year. I’m really happy and proud to be a part of it,” said Chris Butterfield (MSB ’12), one of the RAs who helped to organize the on-campus drive along with Liani Balasuriya (COL ’11).
Johnson added that the drive gave students a way for students to repurpose their unwanted items and help those in need.
Sites are open for dropping off donations until Monday, when the items will be picked up.
New South, Village C West, Village C East, Darnall, Harbin, Southwest Quad, Copley, Village A and LXR all had drop-off sites beginning May 10.

A number of tax hikes could be in store for D.C. residents, as the D.C. Council prepares to vote on measures that would increase taxes on soda, liquor, health club memberships, parking and admission to museums and cultural events, as well as a higher income tax for wealthy residents.
The D.C. Council has come up with the increases, to be voted on later this month, to raise $550 million in revenue for the city budget.
While it is unclear whether any new taxes will be passed, the most controversy has arisen recently over the proposed soda tax. In an effort to raise funds for the Healthy Schools Act of 2010, D.C. Councilmember Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) has proposed a one-cent tax per ounce of soda and other sugary beverages sold in the District, according to the blog, DCist. Cheh hopes that this new tax will help reduce the extent of the obesity epidemic in the District. According to the D.C. Department of Health’s Obesity Report and Action Plan, over 20 percent of adults 18 years and older living in the District are obese. Additionally, over 17 percent of high school-aged people are obese.
While Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), the chair of the council’s finance committee, believes in supporting the Healthy Schools Act of 2010, he said he did not feel the soda tax was the best solution for generating income or reducing obesity rates. Andrew Huff, Evans’ director of communications, said the act could be funded fully without any tax increases as long as the city government exercises fiscal restraint. Huff said that the soda tax, if approved, would likely make little difference in the obesity epidemic. It may even decrease revenue.
“It will have an impact on small and large businesses, [but individuals] will go to Virginia and Maryland to buy their soda,” said Huff. “There’s no proof that taxing soda will cause people to buy it less.”
Brad Glasser (COL ’11), chief executive officer of The Corp, said that the Corp disapproved of the proposed tax and expressed his concern for customer satisfaction.
“It’s certainly nothing we’re looking forward to, [and] we’ve made that opinion known by way of letter to [Councilmember] Cheh,” said Glasser.
“While I’m confident it wouldn’t be a make or break situation for the Corp, it certainly would be unfortunate to have to raise prices. As always, whether its coming internally or being imposed on a governmental level, we really do like to keep prices as low as possible for our customers, and when that ability is taken out of our hands, it really is frustrating.”
Despite The Corp’s frustration, Glasser stated that ultimately, they would respect and comply with whatever decision the D.C. Council makes because of the laudable objectives of the imposed tax.
“We will be forced to comply with whatever the council decides, and hopefully we’d see at the very least some positive impact come out of the funds raises through this [effort] just as we did . from the frustrating bag tax that is going to clean up the Anacostia River, which is a pretty worthy cause at the end of the day,” Glasser said.
Another proposal made by D.C. Councilmember Michael Brown (I-At-Large) includes a new tax plan that would create new income tax brackets. The new plan would impose an income tax rate of 8.9 percent for residents with an annual salary of $250,000 or more and a rate of 9.4 percent for residents with an annual salary of $1 million or more, according to The Washington Post. The income tax rate for residents earning $40,000 or more is currently 8.5 percent. The revenue generated from these new taxes would also benefit the fiscal 2011 budget.
Brown had been worried that the new taxes would drive wealthy residents out of the city into the surrounding suburbs, so he set up a meeting with some of those who would be subject to the new taxes in order to clarify what this new plan would actually mean to them.
Judith Sandalow, executive director of the Children’s Law Center, told The Washington Post that this meeting was a helpful exercise in explaining the new tax plan.
“There were a lot of myths debunked,” Sandalow said.
Councilmember Evans, however, said he felt this tax increase is also unnecessary.
“Councilmember Evans is against all new taxes. . We can’t keep going back to people who pay the highest taxes in the region already,” Huff said.
“The [city] government hasn’t done anything particularly irresponsible, but [it] has to do its part . [they] can’t keep going to residents asking for more money.”

Last week’s murder of University of Virginia student Yeardley Love by her ex-boyfriend George Huguely sent shockwaves across the Georgetown community and other D.C. area college campuses, many of which reported an increase in annual sexual assaults in recent years.
In addition to Georgetown, the University of Virginia, George Mason University and Catholic University also reported an increase in sexual assaults in 2007-2008, according to the Department of Education.
Local schools have become increasingly wary of the problem since UVA lacrosse player Huguely was charged last week in the death of his former girlfriend Love, according to the Washington Examiner. CNN reported that in his testimony, 22-year-old Huguely revealed he had had a violent fight with Love that led to her death. Love, also a UVA lacrosse player, was 22 at the time of her death. Huguely’s lawyer maintains that the incident was an accident.
The situation, however, has brought more attention to assaults on college campuses, and the FBI has concluded that many attacks stem from romantic relationships.
S. Daniel Carter, the policy director at the nonprofit Security on Campus, Inc., a group that studies sexual assaults on campuses, mentioned Georgetown specifically in the Washington Examiner article. Carter said that Georgetown, along with the University of Virginia, has previously had perpetrators and victims sign non-disclosure agreements promising they would not discuss the outcome of an investigation. Victims are not informed of the penalty their attacker received unless they sign the non-disclosure agreement.
Carter said that breaking the culture of silence that surrounds sexual assaults is key to responding to this increase in assaults.
John Zacker, director of the office of student conduct at the University of Maryland, told the Washington Examiner that students are becoming less likely to report obsessive behaviors that lead to sexual assaults. Zacker points to the low percentage of convictions – about 10 to 25 percent, according to the Center for Public Integrity – and the invasive nature of investigations as reasons why students have become less likely to report assaults.
Andy Pino, director of media relations, said that Georgetown is improving its security measures to fight the rise in assaults.
“[The Department of Public Safety] has increased patrols throughout campus over the last year . [and] the university is funding patrols by three additional [Metropolitan Police Department] officers in the areas surrounding campus,” he said.
Pino also mentioned the improved cooperation between DPS and MPD. He reiterated that the university reminds students to lock doors and windows, to travel in groups when possible and to take advantage of the SafeRides shuttle service when traveling to and from campus.”

As the class of 2010 prepares to enter the workforce, the job market in the District and across the nation has begun to show signs of growth.
Most economists are optimistic that the unemployment numbers for the month of April, set for release this month, will show a recovering job market in D.C.
Professor Robert Cumby, a member of the Georgetown department of economics, said that the labor market appeared to be bouncing back.
“The job market, both in Washington [D.C.] and nationwide, is showing real signs of steady improvement. This improvement is consistent with other signs that the recession has ended and the economy is growing again,” Cumby said.
According to professor Stephen Fuller, director of the center for regional analysis at George Mason University, the District will likely see a net gain in jobs from April 2009 to April 2010. The Washington Post reported that the net gain may be as high as 20,000 new jobs.
The District has weathered the recession better than most metropolitan areas, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that the unemployment rate dropped from 6.9 percent in February to 6.7 percent in March. According to Fuller, recent graduates are actually in an even better situation than the unemployment numbers indicate. Fuller said that much of the unemployment in the D.C. area and around the country pertains to sectors that do not affect people with college degrees.
While this may be a promising sign for seniors remaining in the D.C. area after graduation, Cumby said that not all seniors would find such hopeful conditions back home.
“There are lots of local job markets around the country and not all of them improve at the same rate. As graduating seniors disperse around the country, some will find stronger local markets than will others,” Cumby said.
Despite this possible discrepancy based on location, the Career Education Center reported that there is a better recruiting climate for the class of 2010 than there was for the class of 2009.”
According to Mike Schaub, executive director of the Career Education Center, the number of on-campus interviews for full-time jobs is up 12.5 percent from last academic year. The number of on-campus interviews for internships increased 24 percent over the same time period as well. The center’s job database also shows a 22 percent increase in the number of full-time job listings. Fuller said that 80 percent of the job growth in the coming years would be in the private sector. Health services will be the fastest growing industry.
Schaub went on to cite the National Association of Colleges and Employers, which reported that employers plan to hire 5.3 percent more college graduates this year than last year. Nevertheless, Schaub insisted that seniors still need to be flexible in their job hunts and also need to be willing to accept positions with companies that do not necessarily have a big name.
Fuller echoed this sentiment, saying that the ability to adapt is key for college graduates at this time. He said that recent college graduates often have an advantage over unemployed persons who have been in the workforce for many years. According to Fuller, many companies are looking to hire recent graduates because they will work for less pay and have fewer financial obligations than people who have worked for 20 years at a relatively high salary. Additionally, companies see college graduates as eager, willing to take on new ideas and more adept with technology, Fuller said. As recent graduates seek jobs, good writing skills and the ability to communicate with others are essential in marketing themselves well, according to Fuller.
The numbers bode well for recent graduates and Fuller insisted that the job market will only continue to improve.
“It is better to be graduating in 2010 than in 2009, and it will be even better in 2011,” Fuller said.
