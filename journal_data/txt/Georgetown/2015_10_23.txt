After facing allegations of racial profiling, the Georgetown Business Improvement District and Metropolitan Police Department shut down a conversation thread on a group-messaging app meant to identify potential shoplifters Sunday.
The BID and the MPD implemented the group message, dubbed “Operation GroupMe,” in March 2014 to help local businesses communicate with each other and the police to notify the community about shoplifters or dangerous situations. Nearly 400 users communicated on the forum.
Since March, store employees and District police have sent more than 6,000 messages about suspicious shoppers or potentially dangerous situations. Many of the messages are pictures, often taken in secret.
A review by the BID found that of the 3,000 messages sent in the group chat since January, almost 70 percent of the people described as “suspicious” were black.
Following reports in The Georgetowner in August and The Washington Post last week, the BID decided to disable Operation GroupMe, according to a statement CEO Joe Sternlieb posted to the BID website Oct. 18.
“The overriding goal of our retail community is to ensure that everyone who visits Georgetown feels welcomed, comfortable, safe and that their civil rights and individual dignity are protected and respected,” Sternlieb wrote. “So long as there are questions about how this app is being used, this goal cannot be met.”
The BID declined to comment and the MPD did not respond to requests for comment.
Ky Wright, a black senior sales associate at Nine West, used the forum at the Banana Republic on Wisconsin Avenue and M Street, where she previously worked. Wright said that the messages she saw on the app were chiefly about black people.
“Me personally, I only saw black male, black male, black male, black woman, black male — even darker-skin black male too. And I was like, ‘oh, it’s only black people on here,’” Wright said. “It made me uncomfortable. Maybe they’re only paying attention to African-Americans to see if they’re stealing.”
According to messages obtained by The Washington Post, the forum often referenced racial stereotypes and lacked substantial suspcious behavior.
“Suspicious shoppers in store,” an American Apparel retailer said. “3 female. 1 male strong smell of weed. All AfricanAmerican. Help please.”
True Religion, Lacoste and Vineyard Vines employees also said they used the app but declined to comment.
Store manager of L’Occitane Will Chapin said his store did not use the app. He added that the current negative media attention has confirmed his decision to discourage its usage.
“I would be more worried if I had a staff situation and they were to put something on that and it would get out,” Chapin said. “To not be on it is probably a little bit safer for the company on our end.”
Chapin said that he did not blame the businesses themselves for the misuse of the program, but rather the specific employees that used the app in the context of profiling.
“You have stores that, I think, use it legitimately,” Chapin said. “I don’t think it’s the business. It’s probably the person at the time working for the business.”
Urban Outfitters Housewares Manager Jessica Kearns agreed that the fault lies more with the staffers who use the app.
“I think it’s about the people you hire,” Kearns said. “I think we’ve trained our people better than that.”
Kearns added that she did not see the benefit of the app in regard to real-time communication.
“It’s kind of ineffective in my opinion,” Kearns said. “I’d rather just call the police.”
Sociology Department Chair Timothy Wickham-Crowley spoke about the racial profiling that plagues shopping communities.
“What I think we have now is basically a new type of offense, which is SWB: shopping while black,” Wickham-Crowley said. “It’s not shopping while black in general. It’s obviously shopping while black in certain types of neighborhoods.”
Wickham-Crowley added that black shoppers tend to have to alter themselves in order to put white retailers at ease.
“In some sense, they have to bend over backwards in the way they dress, talk, comport themselves,” Wickham-Crowley said. “So that in terms of everything, right down to body language, a person running a retail establishment is not going to be concerned about them.”
Wickham-Crowley expressed hope that the attention brought to this issue will result in change for the Georgetown business community.
“It’s disheartening, but it’s not something I am surprised by,” Wickham-Crowley said. “I think that with all the media publicity that is showing attention to it, it is bringing a light on the negative aspects of the app.”
Marisa Colon (COL ’19) described her experiences shopping in Georgetown and said she is unsurprised by the way retailers were using GroupMe.
“As a black person with white friends, I’ve noticed that when I go into stores on M Street I might get looks or I might not get the attention that I feel I should get,” Colon said. “I’m not surprised. It’s unfortunate because it could be used as a means of communication with the police in a beneficial way, but I’m not surprised that it is not being used that way.”

Sounds like shoplifting is getting ready to make a resurgence on M Street.

Georgetown and Google co-hosted Secretary of State John Kerry’s Climate and Clean Energy Investment Forum on Oct. 20 and 21, gathering federal officials and executives from both the public and private sectors to discuss clean energy initiatives nationwide.
Conference highlights included a fireside chat between Kerry and University President John J. DeGioia at the State Department on Tuesday and a keynote address from Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz in Lohrfink Auditorium at the McDonough School of Business on Wednesday.
Kerry opened the two-day forum with remarks Tuesday morning, citing examples of climate change, including that 19 of the hottest 20 years in history have occurred in the past two decades. He called on participants to use the forum to collaborate and think of long-term solutions.
“The solution to this particular challenge — climate change — is actually just as simple as the realization that it is the challenge that it is,” Kerry said. “We have investment leaders here today, representing trillions of dollars of assets under management, focused, not on abstract discussions, but on real, tangible initiatives that will actually bring about a clean and sustainable future.”
Kerry spoke about the United Nations Climate Change Conference that will be held in Paris this December as a goal for international progress.
“The road through Paris is paved with investment decisions that you’re going to make not tomorrow, but today,” Kerry said. “The good news is that even as we get a better and better understanding of the dangers of our carbon-based economy, we are also getting a better understanding of the many ways we can improve in the ways we power our world.”
Throughout his speech, Kerry continually stressed the economic benefits of addressing climate change.
“The real kicker is that innovations in clean energy and energy efficiency is that they don’t just stave off the worst impacts of climate change. They’re also going to grow our economies and employ our communities,” Kerry said.
Following Kerry’s introduction, NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell moderated a fireside chat with Kerry, DeGioia and Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment Co-Chair Jeremy Grantham.
Mitchell specifically asked DeGioia about the impact of Pope Francis’ June encyclical on the university’s efforts in the area of climate change.
“It did not disappoint. It truly was an extraordinary moment and had served already to inspire us to try to determine how could we, as a university community, respond differently in this moment,” DeGioia said. “Any time we get a little bit self-satisfied or complacent, we just have to take a look at that encyclical and realize there is a significant gap between our current reality, the way we are living, and what he is asking us to do.”
DeGioia spoke primarily about the university’s academic approach, referencing the Global Social Enterprise Initiative and the Georgetown University Law Center’s Georgetown Climate Center.
DeGioia cited the Georgetown Environment Initiative as a main factor of the university’s efforts since its November 2012 launch. Funded by a $20 million anonymous donation, the initiative encourages environmental study across Georgetown’s main, medical and law campuses.
“What we’ve tried to do with the Georgetown Environment Initiative … was harness the power of our institution to look at the integration of policy, law, business, science and try to make the kinds of contributions that universities can make to this dialogue,” DeGioia said.
In his keynote address, Moniz echoed Kerry’s emphasis on the upcoming Paris conference. He cited the recent climate deal between the United States and China as evidence that upcoming conference will result in positive progress.
“I do think it’s fair to say that the optimism of our accomplishing something substantial in Paris is significantly greater than it was a year ago,” Moniz said.
Additionally, Moniz touched on both the short-term and long-term goals for effective climate action.
“We will have to keep squeezing down on carbon emissions, on greenhouse gas emissions in general,” Moniz said. “And that’s the time period where a word I will use a lot today, innovation, is going to be absolutely central to meeting not just long-term goals, 10 or 15 years, but also continuing progress that we will need to make beyond that.”
He specifically referenced the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy that promotes and funds renewable energy and green technologies and spoke about the department’s broad approach to finding clean energy options.
“Our view has been called ‘all of the above.’ Our view is, the goal is low carbon in the energy sector. We believe that there is not one low-carbon solution,” Moniz said. “So what we believe is that our job is to enable any approach to low carbon to compete for a place in the marketplace.”
Moniz concluded the address emphasizing that Paris was not the end point for seeking new, environmentally secure energy solutions.
“So those are some of the things on our minds as we are heading into Paris,” Moniz said. “But, as you can see, we will be really thinking hard about the path from Paris, which is when we really have to work hard to meet our goals in 2025 and beyond.”

Health Education Services received a $10,000 grant from the Stacie Mathewson Foundation to establish the College Recovery Program, Georgetown’s first on-campus program focused on addiction recovery and prevention.
The CRP will provide support and resources for students in recovery from alcohol and drug substance abuse, addiction and eating and mental health disorders. The grant will go toward the program’s formation and continual funding.
Patrick Kilcarr, director of the Health Education Services Center for Personal Development, who is heading the CRP, said that the program will create a supportive community of students to eliminate the stigma associated with addiction recovery.
“[CRP offers] these students not only programming but connections with one another. It’s called a campus recovery community, so it gives individuals the opportunity to interact with one another, to strengthen one another … to move towards their own personal potential,” Kilcarr said.
The Stacie Mathewson Foundation is a national organization founded in 2011 dedicated to addiction recovery and prevention for young adults. The SMF has provided funding for other college recovery programs, including those of the University of Nebraska Omaha, the University of Mississippi and Reno’s University of Nevada.
The SMF receives funding applications from universities that wish to establish their own CRPs. There are more than 100 CRPs established across the country.
Currently, Counseling and Psychiatric Services offers clinical care for students undergoing addiction recovery. However, according to Kilcarr, there is no program specifically focused on addiction.
“Beyond the individual level, we’ve never had anything really substantial for our students until now,” Kilcarr said.
According to Director of Health Education Services Carol Day, the CRP will also serve to facilitate a social and supportive space for students who choose not to consume alcohol.
“Our new Campus Recovery Program helps provide social and programmatic support for those who are choosing not to drink. We know that many students do not drink alcohol and the CRP will contribute to supporting engaging, fun, non-alcohol, social events as well as much needed support for those in recovery,” Day wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The CRP will host its first social event, a screening and discussion of the documentary “The Anonymous People,” followed by a discussion on the power of recovery, in the Healey Family Student Center on Nov. 9.
At the moment, Kilcarr said that he is open to suggestions from the community regarding the future structure and format of the CRP.
“What we’re trying to do now is to get as many students interested and involved as possible to create a core group — a core cadre of students — and then let them begin to really develop the program and move it in the way that they want, rather than direct it towards them,” Kilcarr said.
The CRP will also work with existing organizations on campus such as CAPS and the Georgetown University Student Association to recommend the program to students who could benefit from a college recovery community. According to CAPS Director Phil Meilman, the CRP will complement existing programs at Georgetown to further support students in recovery.
“Any additional services we can provide them in their journey toward improved health are beneficial,” Meilman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This initiative has the potential for providing a healthy, supportive and affirming environment as they readjust to college life.”
Director of Student Outreach and Support in the Division of Student Affairs Katie Boin said she is hopeful that the CRP can positively impact Georgetown students by creating a powerful social community.
“I think this is a wonderful initiative that will allow students to form a community and network that will support their sobriety,” Boin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The social network that can blossom with this type of program has the potential to be really powerful and meaningful to those exploring the social realities of being a college student in recovery.”
According to GUSA Undersecretary of Mental Health Ben Johnson (NHS ’17), the CRP is a notable example of students and administrators working together to design programs that support student health.
“I am happy that students and administrators are addressing and working to improve the state of mental health on campus,” Johnson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Mental health is an advocacy topic that is only just getting started, and I’ve been inspired and impressed by the degree to which many students are already deeply passionate about the subject.”
Katherine Iannuzzelli (NHS ’18), the student liaison from HES to the CRP, helps Kilcarr with programming and further development of the CRP. Iannuzzelli said that CRP is essential in creating a healthy environment for all students.
“College is a difficult place to live in recovery, and this program aims to support this group on campus through fun and educational events. We hope to create a fun and energetic community that encourages a healthy college experience without alcohol and drugs,” Iannuzzelli said.

Georgetown will host its fifth TEDx conference tomorrow in Gaston Hall. With the theme of “Risk Takers,” the daylong event will be divided into three different sections, with the subthemes “Inspiring the Uninspired,” “Fail Forward” and “High Risk, High Reward.” Each section will feature four speakers highlighting different stages or factors in the risk-taking process. After each session, participants will also have the opportunity to interact with speakers and reflect on the topics discussed in breakout sessions, a new addition to this year’s programming.
TEDx, which is a national program of nonprofit, self-organized local events, is a subset of the TED global conference series. In previous years, dozens of TEDx events have been hosted in the Washington, D.C. area.
The program features a diverse range of students, faculty and contributors from outside of the university, including partnerships with restaurants and food vendors at TasTED and a food market in Healy Circle on Saturday. Tickets for TEDx, which are free for Georgetown students and $20 for nonstudents, are available for reservation online.
 
Caroline James (COL ’16)
James, a senior in the College studying government, environmental studies and music, will discuss her experience participating in a political protest and her subsequent arrest.
“It is about the way that civil disobedience and aspects of risk-taking are a way to participate in the democratic process,” James said. “I want people to come away with the sense of what their various passions mean to them.”
James has led environmental efforts on campus through her role as secretary of sustainability for the Georgetown University Student Association, as well as her role in GU Fossil Free. She directs the Georgetown Environmental Leaders initiative, a coalition of student groups, academic departments and university offices that work toward sustainability goals.
James partook in a study abroad program in 2014 to Denmark, Sweden and Germany, where she studied corporate social responsibility and renewable energy systems.
Outside of Georgetown, James has worked for several sustainability organizations, including Environment Georgia, the American Council on Renewable Energy and Sustainable Business International. With SBI, she authored a chapter of an upcoming book about the sustainable wine industry. James intends to enter environmental policy or environmental consulting upon her graduation.
Darius Baxter (COL ’16)
Baxter is a senior in the College studying women’s and gender studies with a concentration in globalization and poverty.
Baxter’s speech will focus on various anecdotes from his personal experience.
“I plan to inspire the crowd by sharing little bits of my life story and weaving those stories together in order to hopefully bring people a little bit of happiness,” Baxter said.
Baxter has had an eclectic Georgetown experience, from congressional internships to partnering with an all-natural Colombian coffee startup called Sunniva Caffe.
This summer, Baxter worked with Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) to successfully draft and introduce legislation designating June as National Gun Violence Awareness Month.
He has also worked in a variety of D.C. youth programs, including the After School Kids Program, the Sursum Corda Tutoring Program, Childfund International and the Special Olympic World Games in Los Angeles, Calif.
He is currently working in the D.C. campaign office of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, and plans to work full-time with the campaign following his graduation before transitioning to Teach for America next year.
Margot Keale (NHS ’16)
Keale is a senior in the School of Nursing and Health Studies studying health care management and policy with minors in government and art history.
On campus, Keale serves as a co-chair of NHS Academic Council and vice-president of the Georgetown University Academic Health Chapter. She is also an NHS peer advisor.
Her talk will address the personal risk she took in coming to Georgetown two years after an autoimmune disease left her paralyzed from the chest down.
“I’ve come to realize that when we don’t admit the risks we take we can’t fully celebrate the moment when we overcome them,” Keale wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’ll be sharing my story in hopes that others feel empowered to reflect upon challenges they face and then celebrate the fact that they’re working through them.”
Keale said that she has been hesitant to share her story and detail the struggles she faced when she left her support system at home to begin life on the Hilltop.
“Even still today, saying this leaves me feeling vulnerable, and I don’t want anyone to know that I at times I have struggled,” Keale wrote.
Elijah Jatovsky (SFS ’16) & Patrick Lim (SFS ’16)
Jatovsky and Lim, both international politics majors in the School of Foreign Service, will give a joint talk about the Syrian refugee crisis through the perspective of their friend, Sami, who won a scholarship opportunity to study in Canada after living in the Zaatari refugee camp for three years.
“We met Sami last year when studying abroad in Jordan,” Jatovsky wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In giving this talk, we hope to raise awareness of an issue that becomes all the more pressing by the day.”
Jatovsky, who speaks Hebrew and Arabic, has lived in both Israel and Jordan. His regional focus is on the Middle East, particularly the Arab-Israeli conflict.
He co-founded J Street U Georgetown, an advocacy group, and collaborated with Lim to help start the Foundation for the Advancement of Refugee Education. He is a peer advisor in the Office of Global Education and a Bunker fellow in Georgetown’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.
On campus, Lim is involved with the Brilliantly British Club and writes for the U.S. Middle East Youth Network. He has also served on the Diplomatic Ball committee.
Scott Dennis (COL ’16)
Dennis is a senior in the College studying government and philosophy.
In his TEDx talk, he will address the work that the university has done on the issue of mental health.
“I wanted to express to people that taking a risk and opening up about their mental health is a vital part to the recovery process for the entire Georgetown community,” Dennis wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Being an active participant in these conversations is about more than sharing a story, it’s also about others hearing that story,” Dennis wrote.
On campus, he is most involved with Active Minds, a group that strives to promote positive conversations surrounding topics of mental health and mental wellness.
He is also involved with the Students of Georgetown, Inc.’s Philanthropy Committee, which redistributes the profits of The Corp back into the student body in the form of grants and scholarships. Outside of Georgetown, he is an AmeriCorps member, a position through which he participated in a variety of governmental projects.
After graduation, he hopes to go on to a career in public service and further pursue his current interests on campus.

The Disability Studies Minor Working Group collaborated with three academic departments this semester to establish Georgetown’s first Disability Studies Course Cluster, a program that engages three classes in monthly lectures and interactive workshops with leading scholars in the field.
According to English professor Libbie Rifkin, who is a member of the working group, the cluster marks an initial step in advancing the creation of a disability studies minor at Georgetown,
“The clusters are sort of a first step potentially toward a minor,” Rifkin said. Students from three courses in the philosophy, English and theology departments are required to attend the lectures and workshops, which are also open to all students. The cluster includes “Bioethics and the Abnormal Body” in the philosophy department, “Introduction to Disability Studies” in the English department and “Religion and Disability Studies” in the theology department.
The second lecture, which took place Wednesday, featured a discussion on the framing of transgender identity as a disability in contemporary Japan from Karen Nakamura, a professor of anthropology and East Asian studies at Yale University.
In September, students participated in the first workshop, which was titled “Disability, Dignity and Ablution: Rituals of Care.” The program was led by Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, an English professor at Emory University, and it examined ideas of dignity and disability in the context of religious and secular imagery.
The third lecture will focus on disability in the Holocaust, with details to be announced.
The DSMWG was formed two years ago by a group of faculty members from different academic departments to advocate for the establishment of a disability studies minor. In 2014, students also expressed their support for disabilities rights advocacy through a #BeingDisabledAtGeorgetown online campaign, which also pushed for the creation of a disability cultural center. The center project, which received support from the Georgetown University Student Association last year, has yet to receive university approval.
Rifkin, who initially conceptualized the program last year, said that it helps students become more aware of disability culture.
“Young people are coming up through a culture where they are surrounded in different kinds of ways by people with [disabilities],” Rifkin said. “We envision a very interdisciplinary program because disability touches everyone.”
The working group organized three events for this semester with the support of faculty in the three departments, as well as the Designing the Future(s) of the University Initiative, GUSA, the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice, the Kennedy Institute of Ethics, the Academic Resource Center and the LGBTQ Resource Center.
According to Rifkin, the cluster, which is currently in its pilot program, will continue with three new courses in the spring semester.
This semester, the three courses are taught by theology professor Julia Watts Belser, philosophy professor Rebecca Kukla and English professor Sara Schotland.
Kukla, who teaches “Bioethics and the Abnormal Body,” said that creating clusters of similar class subjects from different departments has been a university-wide goal for the past few years.
“Georgetown in general has been trying to get a program off the ground where undergraduate courses fall into thematically related clusters,” Kukla said. “In this case, the cluster is around disability theory and disability studies.”
Kukla said the professors in the cluster are granted extensive academic freedom, with the ability to guide their classes in a number of directions. The only standardized element of each class is preparation for the three guest lectures and workshops.
“We’re also coordinating between professors to make sure that the students are getting thematically linked perspectives on these topics,” Kukla said. “But it’s really the visiting speakers and workshops that are tying the three classes together.”
Belser, who teaches “Religion and Disability Studies,” said that the courses explore how the fields of history and anthropology shape disability culture, which is a difficult term to define.
[Disability studies] Belser said. “The workshop sessions are asking the students to think about how history and anthropology can transcend the narrow confines of the classroom. It invites us to think about the social consequences and social significance of disability.”
Belser said that as students become increasingly aware of disability issues, she hopes the classes and lectures can help them become more informed on largely misunderstood topics.
“Disability raises a lot of public questions at the beginning of life and at life’s end,” Belser said. “Right now, a lot of conversation is happening about right-to-die movements or assisted suicide.”
Belser said that the cluster will also allow students to draw connections between disability studies and their own experiences.
“Students are hungry for an opportunity to think about disability,” Belser said. “The thing about disability is that once you start looking for it, it’s everywhere.”
Disabilities rights activist and former GUSA Secretary of Disabilities Affairs Lydia Brown (COL ’15) said the cluster will bolster the establishment of a disability studies minor.
“Georgetown can use the course cluster pilot as a steppingstone toward establishing a full, formalized minor in disability studies,” Brown wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In the past few years, an increasing number of universities have created a disability studies program, including Syracuse University, the University of California Berkeley and the University of Illinois at Chicago.
Brown said that she hopes students in the cluster will be able to apply what they learn in class.
“Ideally, students taking disability studies courses and attending related events would develop more nuanced consciousness of ableism in society and perhaps be better positioned to incorporate a disability justice analysis into their other coursework, campus activities and future employment,” Brown wrote.
GUSA Undersecretary of Disability Affairs Dani Zamalin (NHS ’18) said that the cluster is instrumental in educating students about the significance of disability studies.
“It is no secret that disability studies and accessibility issues come with a certain amount of stigma,” Zamalin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The first step in eliminating this is education.”
Emmy Buck (COL ’16), who is a student in Besler’s class, said that she enjoyed both the first workshop and her class, as it gave her a diverse understanding of disability from a variety of perspectives.
“[The cluster] has been absolutely amazing,” Buck said. “It’s taken both a literary and theological approach … in a way that allows you to get a greater understanding of what is currently going on within the disability community.”

The Georgetown University Law Center and HEC Paris have partnered to create two dual degrees — a Master of Business Administration/Master of Laws and a Grande Ecole Master in Management/Master of Laws — with the first incoming class to begin fall 2016 and graduate in spring 2017.
The degrees were created in response to discussions among professors, students and the Alumni Board. Primary facilitators of the program include GULC adjunct professor Alberto Alemanno, HEC professor Dorothy Mayer and Chair of the European Alumni Board Delphine Addlard.
After initial discussions, the European Alumni Board formally presented the idea to GULC.
GULC Dean William Treanor said the creation of these mixed business and law degrees came as a response to increased interest in programs that combine the two fields.
“At a time in which so much business practice and so much legal practice is global, you’re getting a U.S. LL.M. from a great American law school and an MBA from a top French business school,” Treanor said. “You’re very prepared for a global business practice and a global legal practice. … I think it’s going to be very powerful and very appealing.”
Students will spend the first year studying at HEC Paris, ranked the No. 2 business school in Europe by the Financial Times in 2014, studying core degree requirements. The second and final year for both programs will be completed on GULC’s campus and include more specified curriculums.
“The first year is the general year. So, you would typically do quantitative methods and statistics and organizational behavior,” Treanor said. “The second year, the year in which you specialize, rather than taking some specialized courses at HEC, you’re taking legal studies at Georgetown. So it’s essentially, the year of legal study at Georgetown substitutes for the year of specialization at HEC.”
The MBA/LL.M. program requires students already have a law degree and at least three years of professional experience, while applicants interested in the MiM/LL.M. program must already have a bachelor’s degree in law. Both programs require applicants are fluent in English.
Assistant Dean of Graduate Programs Caryn Voland explained the standards for language and experience that will determine admission to the program.
“We will be looking for people that have done well academically,” Voland said. “They will need to show language fluency at the same level we require of all of our students which is generally a full score on the Test of English as a Foreign Language. … So, strong academic background, professional is required for the MBA and English fluency.”
Voland also emphasized the degrees as a way for graduates to distinguish themselves in the competitive legal industry.
“There are some law firms that send their associates to be trained with an LL.M. in the U.S. because they want more business-savvy lawyers,” Voland said. “All over the world, lawyers are looking to become more competitive and distinguish themselves, so I think that this is an opportunity if they want to show their commitment and understanding of business concepts.”
The degrees do not incur any extra charge or financial change, since students pay HEC Paris tuition for their first year and Georgetown fees for their second one.
Georgetown also offers dual degrees with Tsinghua University in China and provides study abroad opportunities in various universities, including Yonsei Law School in South Korea, Amsterdam Law School, Keio Law School in Japan and ESADE Law School in Spain. Georgetown’s dual-degree program with Sciences Po in Paris for a master’s of international affairs served as model for the HEC collaboration, according to Voland.
Additionally, Treanor indicated that the GULC is interested in expanding its current dual degree offerings.
“We’re actually in the process of looking at other schools around the world that have similar dual degree programs,” Treanor said. “We’re open to expanding this structure.”
HEC Paris Director for International Affairs François Collin also highlighted the dual degree as an opportunity for both the universities and the students to expand their perspectives.
“Students come to HEC with a variety of academic backgrounds, and we look forward to expanding the number of lawyers who will bring their previous legal experiences and perspectives to their study of business here,” Collin said in a GULC press release.

Former Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Javier Solana spoke about challenges the European Union and transatlantic community currently face at the Mortara Center Tuesday afternoon.
Solana, who also formerly served as secretary general of the Council of the European Union, currently serves as president of the Center for Global Economy and Geopolitics in both Barcelona and Madrid, as a distinguished senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution and as a senior visiting professor at the London School of Economics.
The talk began with a discussion of the 2008 economic crisis and its longstanding effect on the European Union. Solana argued that the crisis was especially influential for the E.U. because it was in the infancy of economic unification.
“It was a global event no doubt, but for the European Union, it was very important because we didn’t have at that time the whole structure of the monetary union finished,” Solana said. “Therefore it has been more difficult to get out of the crisis … and we are still suffering with how to completely overcome the problem of the economic crisis.”
According to Solana, the economic crisis caused a divide between northern and southern Europe.
“The European Union began to create a line. I suppose that the line is imaginary for the moment between the North and the South. The crisis was better controlled in the North of the European Union and it was more difficult to control in the Southern Part of the European Union,” Solana said.
He also mentioned that the United Kingdom fluctuating on the issue of leaving the European Union is a prominent issue that has deep consequences for the E.U. Solana spoke to the issue of the east-west divide in the E.U. that he attributed to the crisis in Ukraine and the influx of refugees into Europe.
Discussing the first cause of the east-west divide — Ukraine — Solana suggested working solutions to the problem, including placing increased sanctions on Russia and possible International Monetary Fund efforts to promote energy independence for Ukraine. Solana also argued that relative failures in the Arab Spring have led to the great influx of refugees into Europe, which is especially dramatic because of its geographic location on the Mediterranean Sea.
With regard to the refugee crisis, Solana expressed his belief that the European Union is tackling the issue in an appropriate and effective manner.
“I think the response of the European Union … is the adequate one. We are trying to resolve that problem and we are going to do it by allocating in different countries of the European Union refugees,” Solana said.
He also discussed solutions to the many problems the E.U. currently faces. His first piece of advice was to finalize and cement the economic unification of Europe. Secondly, Solana suggested that the union undergo a unified energy policy.
“We have to do something very, very important with energy. .… We have to move in a direction of constructing this policy,” Solana said.
Diego Garcia Represa (GRD ’16), who attended the event, said he was honored to have the opportunity to speak to such a pivotal actor in the European Union’s government.
“I am a foreign student — I am Spanish — so from the European Union … having the former secretary general of NATO here, it’s an honor and a unique opportunity. I have never had the chance before even in my country or in the Union, so I am honored,” Represa said.
Another attendee, Felix Petri (GRD ’17) said he found Solana’s unique view of the north-south and East-West divides in the EU fascinating.
“I hadn’t really thought about it that way in terms of east-west divide still being a thing. …I was particularly interested in what he had to say about that,” Petri said. “It definitely leaves me with something to think

Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Prasad Kariyawasam expressed his optimism for political and economic reform in his country at a speech in the Intercultural Center on Wednesday night.
The event, titled “Sri Lanka: A Tale of a Resilient Democracy,” was organized by the Asian Pacific Forum and the Asian Studies Program.
Asian Studies professor Irfan Nooruddin, who moderated the event, said that Kariyawasam’s speech is an example of the School of Foreign Service’s growing interest in the South Asian region.
“[The visit] is part of a broader agenda to build the presence of South Asia in the SFS,” Nooruddin said. “Some say South Asia has been neglected in most conversations. … But the ambassador’s visit is a step in the right direction to bringing its issues and importance to the forefront of discussion.”
Kariyawasam served as Sri Lanka’s diplomat to India, Saudi Arabia and Switzerland before becoming ambassador to the United States. Throughout the discussion, he provided examples from his political career to explore a wide variety of topics.
Kariyawasam began by stressing the importance of democratization in Sri Lanka.
“Democracy is a work in progress, and it was hard to say our government was democratic,” Kariyawasam said. “Sri Lankans decided … to go through with a free and fair election, and the democratic institutions were strengthened.”
Sri Lanka, which gained its independence in 1948 after 150 years of British rule, is the oldest democracy in Asia. Since it became independent, the country endured a 25-year civil war between the government and minority ethnic groups.
Kariyawasam said that although the conflict ended in 2009, the government still faces significant challenges in overcoming its history of oppression.
“[The] last government was authoritarian and operated with impunity,” Nooruddin said. “Yet the mood has moved from pessimism to optimism with the revitalization of democratic principles. Sri Lanka is once again a bright spot for democracies.”
As the conversation progressed, Kariyawasam addressed Sri Lanka’s improving relationship with the United States. In September, both countries agreed to draft a resolution that would focus on post-civil war reconciliation efforts in Sri Lanka.
However, the ambassador said that the relationship between the two nations has not always been favorable.
“There were many areas of dissonance in the relationship, especially in the areas of human rights,” Kariyawasam said. “Since the elections, we are increasingly on the same page.”
Kariyawasam said that Sri Lanka is also positioning itself to continue strong economic growth. The country’s gross domestic product growth rate has remained above 6.5 percent since 2009, a higher rate than those of India and Pakistan.
According to Kariyawasam, the Sri Lanka’s positioning as a trade hub is important to its economic prosperity and international relationships. Seventy percent of the world’s oil passes through the region, providing incentive for Sri Lanka, India and China to strengthen their relations.
“We are in the intersection of a power play with world commerce and world powers,” Kariyawasam said. “Our partnerships and the liberalizations of our economy will only allow for further prosperity.”
Amanda Zhu (MSB ’17) said she was unaware of the country’s recent social, political and economic progress prior to Kariyawasam’s speech.
“Sri Lanka is usually talked about tangentially in relationship to China and India,” Zhu said. “But people should be paying attention to it more. The shift into a more democratic government is a success story, but so are its economic and political developments. Its regional importance will only expand.”
Yohan Senarath (SFS ’17), a student in the Asian Studies Program, said Kariyawasam is one of the most effective political operators and commentators in Sri Lanka.
“I find him to be an oxymoron in the world of diplomacy. He is genuine, insightful and incisive when it comes to providing sharp analysis on the relevant issues,” Senarath said. “These qualities are what make the ambassador one of the most respected diplomats working today.”
Senarath said that he hoped the conversation will change commonly held perceptions about Sri Lanka.
“Most Americans consider Sri Lanka a noteworthy country, but not at the level of importance that is shared by actual policymakers,” Senarath said. “You are only likely to see the nation feature more prominently as future issues centered within the region continue to play out.”
