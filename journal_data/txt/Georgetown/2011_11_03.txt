Arguing for the abolition of the death penalty and the need for judicial reform Tuesday night, Troy Davis’ sister and other panelists condemned Davis’ controversial execution.
Davis, who was convicted of the 1989 murder of a police officer, was executed in September amidst a media firestorm of questions surrounding the legitimacy of the verdict after several witnesses recanted their testimony.
A petition calling for a clemency in Davis’ case gathered almost one million signatures, renewing a nationwide debate about the death penalty in America.
“It’s incredibly important to discuss this in light of the events that transpired,” Zachary Allard (GRD) said.
Tuesday’s panel, organized by Carolyn Forche, director of the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice, was the first of a new Lannan Center discussion series called “Matters of Urgency.” The panel also included Lawrence Hayes, a death row exoneree and co-founder of Campaign to End the Death Penalty, Laura Moye, director of Amnesty International USA’s Death Penalty Abolition Campaign and Kimberly Davis, activist and Troy Davis’ sister.
The panel began with a film that covered the campaign to appeal his sentence and made the case for Davis’ innocence.
“Troy Davis is not just a case. Troy Davis is a human being,” Jen Marlowe, the film’s director, said before introducing Davis’ sister.
Kimberly Davis gave an emotional testimony as she shared stories from her childhood. She recounted that after being diagnosed at age 14 with multiple sclerosis, she was told she might never walk again. It was her brother, she said, who sat at her bedside each day, withdrew from school, enrolled in night classes and started to work to help his family.
“He was my hero,” she said.
Other panelists also touched on their personal connections to death row.
Hayes described his conviction, time on death row and eventual release, the experiences of which have inspired him to co-found the Campaign to End the Death Penalty and become involved with the Davis family’s struggle for justice.
“The integrity of the American judicial system is as low as it ever can be. … We need to take back our justice system,” he said.
Moye argued for the abolition of the death penalty in the United States, noting that two-thirds of the world’s countries have already done so. She also emphasized the racial disparities in the application of the death penalty.
“In a country as sophisticated as ours, surely we can move past caveman-like retributive justice,” she said.

The Georgetown University Alumni Association announced that they will hold the second annual International Leaders Weekend Nov. 4th and 5th at Hotel Regina in Paris, France.
The conference, organized by the Georgetown University Alumni Association, allows alumni club leaders from around the world to network with Georgetown alumni internationally.
Founder and former President of the Alumni Club of France Sheherazade Semsar de Boisseson (SFS ’90, GRD ’90), offered to help organize the event.
According to Director of Alumni Relations Gail Griffith, the conference will be larger than last year’s weekend in London.
“This year we have a more robust network of international alumni, and we’ve been working with clubs to build up and provide resources,” Griffith said. “Alumni are traveling from places as far away as India and Hong Kong to participate.”
The conference will include both undergraduate and graduate school alumni from the classes of 1962 to 2010.
Throughout the year, alumni club leaders communicate through conference calls to discuss club practices, guidelines and setting up new clubs. However, this event provides the largest opportunity for alumni to interact in person.
The weekend will include panels about effective club leadership, current plans of the alumni association, roundtable discussions and receptions held by Semsar de Boisseson (F ’90, MSFS ’90) and the Mona Bismarck Foundation, which sponsors Franco-American art, science and education.
Planned speakers for the conference include R. Bartley Moore (SFS ’87) vice president for advancement, and Laura Wayland, senior director of alumni relations.
This year’s conference follows the launch of the Campaign for Georgetown, and events planned for the weekend include discussions of the initiative. Although alumni donations to the campaign will not be solicited at the conference, many attendees are already donors. Additionally, the international clubs have the ability to raise scholarship money.
Feedback from past conferences has been extremely enthusiastic according to Griffith..
“Alumni are amazed and delighted that Georgetown is finally coming to them,” she said. “It gives them a sense that they mean something to us, and that we consider their engagement significant.”

Before changes to the Catholic liturgy come into full effect Nov. 27, campus ministry has been gradually implementing the alterations at services in Dahlgren Chapel.
The modifications, which are aimed at unifying the global Catholic community, will affect prayers and the call-and-response dialogue between priests and the congregation, along with other aspects of the Mass. Almost every sentence of the liturgy will be altered in some way.
Students who attend Sunday mass at Dahlgren Chapel have been introduced to some of the musical response changes over the past three weeks. Changes to the words of the liturgy will take effect on the first Sunday of Advent.
According to Director of Music and Liturgy Jim Wickman, the changes are the product of 10 years of study conducted by scholars, liturgists and biblical experts aimed at bringing the language of the Mass closer in line with the original Latin text.
“What we have now is ‘formal equivalence,’ which means a literal translation from the Latin — no paraphrases or general meaning of the Latin,” Wickman said.
The current language used by the Church, called “dynamic equivalence” and put in place by Second Vatican Council, is not a literal translation.
“[Dynamic equivalence] seeks to try to get at the heart of what is meant,” Fr. Patrick Rogers, S.J., director of campus ministry, said.
Throughout the fall semester, priests have taken time during the liturgy to explain these changes and why they matter.
“These words touch upon important Scriptural references [that allow us] to enter more deeply into the mystery that is the Catholic Mass,” Rogers said. “We want to have some kind of a standard so that people can enter into the same dynamics when they come out of the Mass.”
The university has held two information sessions in Dahlgren during the month of October to create dialogue about these changes with students. Monsignor Andrew Wadsworth, general secretary of the committee that wrote the English translation, will attend the third and final information session on Nov. 16 in Dahlgren Chapel.
Kieran Halloran (SFS ’14), an active altar server and member of the Knights of Columbus and Catholic Students Association, said that he first heard about the changes to the liturgy a year ago.
“It is important [to have these changes] because, especially with prayer, you want to be doing the best that you can do to get to the essence of the Mass,” Halloran said.
Wickman said that he hoped that the information sessions would help students to understand why the changes are important.
“We feel our responsibility is to give students a good grounding in their faith to live that faith,” he said. “This is part of it.”

When Emily Bertsche (SFS ’12) arrived on campus three-and-a-half years ago, she may have been across the country in a brand-new environment, but she was surrounded by some familiar faces.
As one of 10 graduates of St. Ignatius College Prep, a Jesuit school in Chicago, Ill., to matriculate into Georgetown from her grade, Bertsche could tackle college with a built-in community.
“The best part of going to Georgetown [with so many people from high school] is that you have a guaranteed support network from the get-go,” she said. “It’s great because we have a shared past andpresent.”
St. Ignatius is among several of Georgetown’s “feeder schools” ­— high schools that regularly send large numbers of applications to the university. The close relationship these schools have with Georgetown can be a boon to prospective students both during the application process and after they have found their way to the Hilltop.
Tallying the Numbers
During the admissions cycle for the class of 2015, the university saw upwards of 50 applications from seven high schools across the country that admissions counselors target.
Four of the Northeast’s elite boarding schools — Phillips Academy in Massachusetts, Choate Rosemary Hall in Connecticut, Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey — topped the list, sending 69, 66, 65 and 62 applications respectively.
The next six schools on the list include Regis High School in New York with 55 applicants, Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts and Chaminade High School in New York with 53 each, St. Ignatius College Prep with 48. Harvard-Westlake School in California with 45 and Winston Churchill High School with 45.
The Jesuit tradition can often play into many students’ application processes. Regis and St. Ignatius are two premier Jesuit high schools on the top-10 list.
Georgetown Visitation, an all-girls Catholic school just outside the front gates, regularly produces more than 20 applicants to the university each year, nearly half of whom end up studying on the Hilltop, according to a Visitation college information packet. Of the 26 Visitation seniors who applied to Georgetown in 2010, nine now attend the university.
Application information for the Gonzaga College High School, an all-boys D.C. Jesuit standard, and Loyola Academy in Chicago, was not yet available for the class of 2016’s application process, but in years past an average of five to 10 students from each of these schools have matriculated each year.
“I can’t really speak for all of Gonzaga but if it were a feeder for any college, I guess it would be Georgetown,” said Brian Potochney (SFS ’15), a graduate of Gonzaga. “People definitely seemed particularly excited when I would say I was coming here, not just because Georgetown is well-known, but also because of the whole Jesuit connection.”
According to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon, Georgetown relies on these schools to supply a substantial number of applicants.
“Year to year, we know we’re going to get a good number of applications from [them] and a regular flow of students,” he said.
FOSTERING A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions reaches out to prospective students at high schools that regularly send students to the nation’s top universities through receptions for local students, college conferences and personal visits by admissions officers at about 350 high schools every year.
According to Deacon, the majority of these stops are at schools with a strong history of student interest in Georgetown.
“High school visits are a traditional, but not the most effective, form of outreach in the college process,” he said.
After all, students at feeder schools often hear about Georgetown from their high schools’ alumni and faculty with a Blue and Gray background before visiting the school.
“The president of my high school had also gone to Georgetown and is close friends with my family, [so] I also had the great fortune of hearing about Georgetown through his eyes before making my final decision,” said Madeline Molo (COL ’12), another Ignatius alum.
Although Georgetown is not required to accept a certain percentage of students from the surrounding area, the university makes an effort to establish ties with many of D.C.’s Catholic schools. For students at these targeted schools, a closer connection with Georgetown and their shared institutional values play into their May-time decisions.
“I definitely feel like the Jesuit universities were more popular choices among Gonzaga students than among kids in other high schools around here,” Potochney said. “Coming from Gonzaga, I had a lot of Jesuit universities on my radar that I would never have considered had I gone to public school, includingGeorgetown.”
WHAT’S IN A NAME
Despite their high application rate, college counselors and students at feeder schools often reject the title.
“I don’t believe in the word ‘feeder.’ We send a good number of students to Georgetown every year, but Gonzaga students look all over the place,” Eli Clarke, director of college counseling at Gonzaga, said.
“I can’t give an average of the number of students we send to Georgetown, since it varies: some years there are more, some less,” he added.
Suzanne Colligan, director of college counseling at Georgetown Visitation, also hesitated to put her school in this category.
“Georgetown is a popular choice, but [it] is only one among other schools to which we send a lot of students,” Colligan said.
According to Molo, high schools’ unwillingness to call themselves “feeders” may link back to the term’s negative connotation.
“I think of feeder schools as schools that automatically have an ‘in’ with a university and [that] somewhat gives it a negative connotation,” she said.
Deacon denied that students from feeder schools have a higher chance of admission at Georgetown.
“The only advantage that these feeder schools have is that admissions knows the schools better and is familiar with their curriculum,” he said.
Deacon emphasized that, despite the number of students that come from feeder schools, over half of the students at Georgetown are the only individuals to come from their respective high schools.
Molo added that the large number of alums from her high school that attend Georgetown is more attributable to the schools’ shared values than her high school’s “feeder school” status.
“[It] has a lot to do with the Jesuit identity of Ignatius and of Georgetown and the experience that students have going to a Jesuit high school that they might want to continue at university,” she said.
A PREORDAINED LEGACY
For alumni of Jesuit feeder schools, the benefits of attending lasts beyond the application process.
“I really enjoy going to college with people from my high school,” said Hannah Klusendorf (COL ’12), one of 11 Loyola graduates to join the Class of 2012.
Though Klusendorf did not intend to keep in touch with her high school classmates while at Georgetown, she ended up living on the same floor of Harbin Hall with two other Loyola graduates her freshman year and has roomed with them for the past two years.
“I love that we have a common history, and we can talk about ‘that kid from high school’ or ‘that teacher’ or ‘that dance,'” she said. “I love Chicago, and I get to hang out with it every day [through friends from Loyola].”
George Burton (COL ’13), a graduate of Georgetown Prep, agreed that matriculating to Georgetown from a feeder school offered social advantages during his early days as a Hoya.
“I feel like [knowing so many classmates] provided for an easier transition into college,” he said.
Potochney said that, though he felt a similar sense of camaraderie on campus with his peers from Gonzaga, the larger campus size caused many of them to drift apart.
“Having a few familiar faces around campus has been nice, especially in the first few days when I didn’t really know anyone else. But these days, I’ll only run into kids from Gonzaga maybe once or twice a week. I’m friendly with all of them, but we’re not super close,” he said.
Aside from the familiar faces and longtime friends, graduates of feeder schools value the ability to study at a university that carries out the same values that their high schools do.
“Even though my high school and college religious experiences have been very different, there have definitely been common threads: the opportunities to do service, have a meaningful liturgy, focus oncura personalis.”
Klusendorf agreed.
“I believed [in high school] and still do now that Georgetown’s Jesuit identity sets us apart from other top-tier universities. I am proud to still be part of a community that wants to be men and women for others,” she said.

Georgetown resident and D.C. council candidate for Ward 2 Fiona Greig voiced support for some off-campus student housing and university expansion as she announced her campaign against incumbent Jack Evans.
Greig, who has been a Ward 2 resident since 2007, will face off against Evans in November 2012. Evans has occupied the Ward 2 seat for the last 20 years and been historically less supportive of Georgetown’s expansion. Last election cycle, Evans won the seat with 65 percent, according to the Evans camp.
Though she was hesitant to fully endorse the 2010 Campus Plan, Greig said that she would like to work with the university and neighbors to create a practical plan for growth.
“I don’t think there’s enough support for it [in the community], but I do think the university should be allowed to grow, and I’d like to look further into its provisions,” she said,
Greig added that she agrees with some tenets of the current plan.
“I do believe that Georgetown is a permanent institution in this neighborhood, and the students deserve to have a say,” she said. “Even if they’re here for only four years, that’s comparable to the amount of time some professionals stay [in the area].”
In response, Evans said that he supports the university as a part of the District.
“[Georgetown] is an outstanding university and welcome in the community,” Evans said, adding that he has no set position on possible stipulations to the campus plan proposed by the D.C. Office of Planning that call for the university to house all students on campus by 2016.
In regards to neighborhood accusations about raucous student behaviors, Evans said that incidents should be evaluated on a case-by-case approach.
“You can’t generalize [about students],” Evans said. “It just depends [on the individual].”
Greig expressed support for off-campus student housing, an issue that has been the focal point of neighborhood frustration with the university.
“Students should have the right to live off campus,” she said. “I think students should feel proud of the neighborhood they live in and feel that they are neighbors. I don’t want a few bad apples to sour the whole batch.”
She also suggested that she would help Georgetown establish a satellite campus location at the Georgetown waterfront.
“[It] could be very proximate for students,” she said.
But Greig added that she thinks the university’s administration needs to continue to take action such as monitoring party activity to boost its accountability to neighbors.
“The university needs to be very proactive [and act as] a steward in the neighborhood on behalf of students,” she said.
ANC student representative Jake Sticka (COL ’13) said that he found Greig’s willingness to interact with students encouraging.
“[At a meeting in White-Gravenor Hall] she spoke to students, she took questions and she has reached out to me several times,” Sticka said. “I think we need a councilmember to engage with students, and I appreciate her moderate stance on the Campus Plan.”
Sticka said that Greig’s position in regards to the university makes her a unique candidate.
“That’s a significant difference between her and Evans. She really does understand what a key role the university plays in Ward 2 and the city,” he said.
Craig Cassey (COL ’15), the campus captain for Greig’s campaign, said Greig could become an advocate for students’ needs.
“She believes that students should have a voice [and] that we are a main part of Georgetown” Cassey said. “[Greig] is happy to see two student spots on the ANC board [as] she feels we have been underrepresented in the past.”
According to Cassey, Greig’s on-campus campaign team will be promoting voter registration and providing ways for students registered in different cities to switch residency.
Ash Das (MSB ’15), Greig supporter and campaigner, said that the student vote will play an important role on election day.
“It’s really up to us to mobilize [Greig’s] campaign,” Das said.

Following last weekend’s public launch of Georgetown’s $1.5 billion capital campaign, the initiative remains on track to reach its goal by 2016 after reaching the $799 million mark Tuesday.
Raking in a number of verbal and written commitments, the Office of Advancement recorded a haul of $21 million over the weekend’s events. Vice President for Advancement R.Bartley Moore indicated that the campaign, which is expected to last 10 years, will meet its objectives.
“We are confident we will reach our goal in that timeframe,” Moore said.
To continue the push, the university is planning smaller-scale launch events in 10 major cities with strong alumni presence over the next 18 months and a student campaign drive slated for the spring semester.
Moore added that given an improvement in the economy, the goal may be either increased or met sooner than expected.
“Despite the economic challenges that all of us are living through, there is the possibility for us to continually improve our results for Georgetown year over year for the life of the campaign,” Moore said.
The flurry of speaker panels, toasts and galas on campus last weekend was scheduled to coincide with the usual annual fall meetings of the Board of Directors, Board of Regents, alumni Board of Governors and a number of other governing institutions. The festivities were paid for by the Office of Advancement, which did not receive extra funding to offset the significant expense of the project. Additionally, there was no registration fee for attendance.
“We bore the full expense because we thought it would be neither polite nor effective to charge people to attend the launch of a major fundraising campaign,” Moore said.
After beginning its quiet, first phase in July 2006, the $778 million raised before the public launch was the largest five-year fundraising effort in university history.
With just under $600 million of the total commitments in the bank, the rest of the commitments have been pledged for payment within five years.
For Moore, the goals of the weekend’s events were twofold.
“One was to demonstrate to our community of alumni, parents and friends how thoroughly and carefully we have thought through the objectives of this campaign,” he said. “The second objective was we wanted students to feel and see and be engaged by the events of the launch weekend. … It is important to me that students understand that we work as hard as we do … because it helps make everything that happens at the university, even right now, today, possible.”
Donations are separated into three categories. The first are current-use gifts which are meant by the donor to be spent immediately, such as scholarship donations. These make up 51 percent of the current campaign funds.
The endowment donations, which make up 41 percent of the money, are invested and then the annual return from the investment, assumed to be about 5 percent, is spent each year.
Capital gifts, which are intended for major, one-time infrastructure investments -— typically for buildings or equipment — compose 8 percent of the donations so far. The lower portion of funds earmarked for capital projects reflects the smaller emphasis on such improvements in contrast with previous campaigns, which included objectives like the Southwest Quadrangle.
“This is a comparatively less capital-intensive campaign,” Moore said.
Allocation of the $1.5 billion raised will take a four-pillar approach, according to Moore.
The first pillar, student access and excellence, will receive $500 million, with $400 million allocated to undergraduate programming and the remainder apportioned to graduate programming. The top priority of this allotment is financial aid, including both individual and aggregate needs.
The second pillar, faculty access and excellence, also will be granted $500 million for salaries and research.
The third pillar consists of $200 million for student life and capital expansion, including funding for the planned Intercollegiate Athletic Center and New South Student Center. However, a majority of the sum will go toward programmatic improvements, including mission and ministry.
The fourth pillar, transformative opportunities, will be allocated $300 million. The most nebulous of the categories, transformative opportunities, is designed to advance the mission of the university in the future.
“As a part of the university-wide process of planning for the campaign, we asked every campus and every unit to identify big ambitions that to be truly transformative would require very significant levels of donor support,” Moore said. “We identified a smaller number of those we thought were … most promising or the likeliest to meaningfully engage our donor community.”
Prominent ideas include an expansion of the Georgetown Public Policy Institute and an integrated environmental studies program. Moore emphasized that the focus of the pillar could change with donor feedback.
“In a way it is a free marketplace to see which receives the required level of donor support,” he said.

The university launched two new projects this week in an effort to strengthen Georgetown’s relationship with the surrounding community.
On Thursday, President John J. DeGioia sent out a blast email to faculty, students and staff urging them to sign a online petition in support of the Campus Plan.
In his appeal, he stressed that Georgetown is the largest private employer in the District and cited The Washington Post’s Oct. 24 editorial in support of the Campus Plan.
He also called attention to the measures Georgetown has taken in recent months to improve the safety and cleanliness of the community.
“Together, the names of hundreds of members of the Hoya family can send a message that we support strengthening Georgetown’s position as a world-class university,” he wrote.
The petition has received widespread support within the university, with large numbers of students sharing DeGioia’s letter on Facebook.
Kerr said that the appeal will also be distributed to District-area alumni, friends of the university and neighbors. She hopes that the letter, in tandem with the university’s public relations efforts, will improve neighborhood opinions of the university in the run-up to the next Zoning Commission hearing about the plan on Nov. 17.
“We believe we have an impact in the community, and this letter is a way [for community members] to demonstrate support for our contributions,” she said.
Wednesday saw the release of Rocky’s Report, a weekly update from the Office of Public Safety intended to educate and inform the Georgetown community on neighborhood safety issues.
According to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, the report will be written by Georgetown Chief of Police Rocco Del Monaco in an effort to establish clear communication with Georgetown residents about recent incidents in the neighborhood.
“Rocky will separate fact from fiction, set the record straight and give a report directly from the folks who are in the neighborhoods responding to concerns and proactively working to keep us safe,” Kerr wrote in an email.
Kerr said that while much of the content of Department of Public Safety and Metropolitan Police Department investigations are confidential, the university wants to communicate as much information as possible to the surrounding community.
“Conversations between the leadership and officers at DPS, officials at the university and MPD … sometimes contain confidential information, but there is also a lot going on that is helpful for the community to know, and we think it is important for us to present information in a way that is understandable to people sitting around their dinner tables,” she told The Hoya.
Rocky’s Report will be sent to neighborhood email listserves and posted on Georgetown’s neighborhood communications website: neighborhood.georgetown.edu.
The initiative is the latest in a series of measures designed to ramp up engagement with the surrounding community and demonstrate Georgetown’s status as a good neighbor. To date, Georgetown has transported 9,300 students on its new M Street Shuttle, picked up 120 tons of trash in twice-daily trash patrols and paid for additional MPD presence in order to smooth over contentious relations with neighbors.

For L. Francis III (CAS ’75, LAW ’78) and Kathleen (SFS ’77) Rooney of Naples, Fla., who contributed $6 million toward the ongoing restoration of Dahlgren Chapel, ensuring the future of the sacred space was a cause close to their hearts.
According to Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., the Rooneys met at Georgetown and frequently attended Catholic mass at Dahlgren. Francis Rooney also served as a U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.
“They were interested in giving back to the community. When the university presented them this idea, they felt it was the perfect chance,” O’Brien said. “Dahlgren was an important place to Francis and Kathleen’s faith. They want to share that gift with future generations of students.”
The university announced the Rooneys’ gift Saturday at the Mass of the Thanksgiving honoring the donors, at which Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, former archbishop emeritus of Washington, presided.
“This chapel is at the center of everything we are. The donation will allow the liturgical life, the prayer life and the worship that goes on in the chapel to continue. It will allow us to maintain the chapel as our spiritual home for another century,” O’Brien said.
Although other gifts have been received, the university will continue to solicit donations in order to cover the $7.5 million dollar cost of construction.
“Donors include those who went to Mass and who were married at Dahlgren,” O’Brien said. “This is just a wonderful way to give back, because the chapel is the university’s spiritual home, the heart of the campus and the symbol of who we are as a Jesuit school.”
The Rooneys’ donation will be used primarily to reinforce the chapel’s eroding foundation and renovate its interior.
The money was donated through the couple’s non-profit, the Francis and Kathleen Rooney Foundation, which supports a variety of charitable causes.
The Rooneys also contributed $10 million to Notre Dame University to create the Center for the Study of American Democracy in 2008. The gift was part of the $1.5 billion “Spirit of Notre Dame” campaign, which was the most extensive fundraising effort in Catholic higher education at the time of its announcement.
Francis Rooney is the majority owner in Manhattan Construction, the firm that is organizing the repairs to the chapel. Rooney was also chief executive officer of Rooney Holdings, an investment and holding firm.
Throughout October, Manhattan Construction has been focusing on utilities and soil erosion work so that future repairs may be conducted, according to an update from the Catholic Chaplaincy. Vegetation was removed from around the chapel, and digging has begun around the perimeter of the building.
Cracks on the chapel’s rose window and falling plaster led the university to temporarily close the chapel in the fall of 2007.The window was removed in 2009 to protect the glass after it was observed that the window was bowed.
Renovations to the chapel’s foundation are scheduled to be completed first to prevent further cracks in interior walls and stained glass windows. Interior repairs including new seating and lighting will follow. The stained glass windows, which have not been cleaned for over a hundred years, will be removed, refurbished and reinstalled in the course of the renovations.
“The chapel will remain open throughout the restoration, except for maybe a few days when we remove the stained glass windows,” O’Brien said.

Muni Figueres, Costa Rican ambassador to the United States, stressed the importance of international child protection in a keynote address at the “Kids in Between: Exploring a Unified Strategy for Child Protection in the Americas” conference Thursday morning.
“Truly the greatest test of any human grouping is its ability to nurture children,” Figueres said. “A country’s richest resource is, of course, its people.”
The conference, which was co-sponsored by the International Social Service and the Georgetown Public Policy Institute Center for Public and Nonprofit Leadership, focused on the need for a childcare system that caters to those who are neglected by the child protection system in the United States, Mexico and Central America.
During her keynote address in Lohrfink Auditorium, Figueres described the conference as just the first step toward international child protection.
“This is the beginning of a series … of explorations of diagnostics in Latin America’s children’s issues,” she said.
Figueres said that there are several ways to measure a country’s developmental capacity, including their treatment of women, the elderly, the disabled and animals.
“We are, after all, like the U.S.; a nation of immigrants and very proud of it,” Figueres said.
But according to Figueres, immigration can lead to the separation of families, creating the necessity for an ISS presence in Latin America.
The organization, which aims to help children, adults and families separated by international borders, offers services such as tracing documents, child protection alerts and training for legal and social service personnel that deal with international cases.
“ISS combines thinking with action,” she said. “This conference is important, it’s necessary. It’s more than timely, it’s urgent.”
Figueres said that she thought organized crime, drugs and weapons represented the most pressing issues in child and family protection.
“I think that there is a deep sense of urgency that we can tap into,” she said, adding that she wanted to focus on raising awareness of these issues in the United States.

Students were forced to retake exams after their tests were stolen from the McDonough School of Business mailroom last week.
Some time between Oct. 25 and 26, an unknown person took documents from the MSB mailroom. The theft primarily affected MSB adjunct lecturer James Dalkin’s accounting class, requiring the three students whose tests were stolen to retake the exam.
“I regret any inconvenience this has caused, but it relates to circumstances beyond my control,” Dalkinwrote in an email sent to affected students.
One of the students affected, Anthony Mastroianni (COL ’12), a cartoonist for The Hoya, said that the accounting exam was administered electronically, but Dalkin asked his students to print and submit a hard copy of their answers. Three students had experienced technical issues that precluded their electronic responses from being recorded and had submitted their own hard copies. With those hard copies stolen, no record of their test answers remained. The trio retook the test earlier this week during a regular lecture.
Dalkin was unsure about whether or not anything else was taken, but thought that a finance class may also have been affected.
“I know the dean’s office has looked into the matter and has developed some new procedures for mail security,” Dalkin said.
The mailroom is currently open to the public during regular business hours, a policy that is now being re-evaluated.
University officials and MSB Deputy Dean and professor Pietra Rivoli declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.
