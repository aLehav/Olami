The Georgetown University Native American Student Council plans to begin collecting signatures from students on a petition urging the university to increase support for and representation of indigenous students by March 19. 
The petition is set to be submitted to the Office of the President on April 1, the first day of Native American Heritage Month, according to NASC leaders. The NASC, a student affinity group recognized by the university, is committed to discussing events affecting Native American communities and promoting Native American culture. The organization, which was founded in 2012, aims to accrue at least 500 signatures before submitting the petition to administration. 
Poor support services, lack of representation on campus and university neglect of indigenous students motivated the creation of the petition, according to Kelsey Lawson (SFS ’19), president of the NASC.
“NASC feels compelled to submit the petition at this time because we have been facing a plethora of issues regarding member recruitment, support services, and a general lack of recognition of indigenous peoples from Georgetown at an institutional level,” Lawson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The petition will also include a list of 12 demands for the university. Among the drafted demands is a call for the university to hire more indigenous faculty members and establish a full-time position of Program Coordinator for Native American Students.
Additionally, the petition seeks academic reforms, calling for “the inclusion of Native American peoples in the core curriculum, with special consideration of the status of tribal nations as sovereign nations,” and “the creation of a Native studies major and/or minor/certificate,” according to a draft of the petition. 
To bolster university recruitment efforts, the petition calls on Georgetown to partner with College Horizons, a nonprofit that offers college admissions assistance to Native American students. Peer institutions such as Northwestern University and Duke University are currently partnered with College Horizons.
Poor representation of indigenous communities and limited university efforts to recruit indigenous students are among student concerns, according to NASC treasurer Yasmin Zuch (NHS ’20).
“It has always been a concern to me —  the number of indigenous students on campus and their representation in the community. Because I know my freshman year I had no sense of that,” Zuch said. “Personally speaking it was a really hard time adjusting to this culture shock and trying to find a support group on campus where I could relate on the basis of being an indigenous person here.”
Georgetown’s efforts to recruit indigenous students to the university have been inadequate, Zuch said. 
“I know that a lot of other people in NASC, during their application processes to other universities, we all found support during the application process because of our indigenous backgrounds. But with Georgetown there wasn’t anything like that; there was no outreach,” Zuch said. “There is a nationwide crisis of native students just not continuing higher education, and I think it’s really problematic that a university would continue to encourage this by not taking action.”
The petition, originally drafted Feb. 22, has already been shared with some students and faculty members for feedback and requires only a few revisions, according to Zuch. 
“At this point, it’s just a matter of circulating it and getting the word out,” Zuch said.
NASC plans to launch a large social media campaign and partner with other affinity organizations on campus, including La Casa Latina and Black House, to publicize the petition, according to Zuch and Lawson.
Efforts by indigenous students to establish assistance and forge a community on campus have proven fruitless, according to the petition.
“We feel as though we have exhausted our resources and have had to navigate through an overly complex bureaucratic structure that has largely inhibited our attempts to establish and sustain a community for Native students on campus,” the petition reads. 
The petition grew out of other efforts the community made to address its concerns in the past, according to Zuch.
“It seems like we’re continuously being pushed back and consistently diverted to other people to ask questions, and it seemed like nothing was actually being done when we were voicing our concerns,” Zuch said. “That’s what built up our frustrations: consistently asking for help and not seeing any change come out of it.”

The Office of Residential Living approved the establishment of an Asian-American affinity residential house, the Asian-American Hub for Organizing, Movement and Empowerment, on Feb. 27.
The approval comes after a push from the Asian-Pacific Islander Leadership Forum, who announced Residential Living’s decision in a March 11 Facebook post.
The Asian-American HOME is a space that will serve as a justice-oriented community for students of color at Georgetown and based on the campaigns that led to the creation of the Black House and La Casa Latina, according to the APILF Facebook page.
“The House would serve as a space for dialogues and community events related to Asian America and an affirming space for all students, particularly students of color,” APILF wrote on their website.
Four students will live in the first iteration of this house in the 2019-2020 academic year, with Ester Sihite, the assistant director of diversity education at the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, serving as the faculty advisor. 
The house will be located on Magis Row, one of the Living Learning Communities offered through an application process by the university each year. Students submitted proposals based on a variety of personal and academic interests, and Asian-American HOME is one of nine selected to join Magis Row for the 2019-2020 academic year, according to Ed Gilhool, executive director of residential education.
All three affinity houses, which are each aligned with a cultural identity, share common sentiments regarding improving inclusivity and diversity on Georgetown’s campus. However, the Asian-American HOME differs from Black House and La Casa Latina as the other two affinity houses are owned by the CMEA, Gilhool wrote on behalf of Residential Living.
“Unlike the Black House and Casa Latina, Magis Row houses are reviewed and selected on an annual basis,” Gilhool wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Students may reapply to return for the following year, but placement is not guaranteed.”
Outgoing Georgetown University Student Association President Juan Martinez (SFS ’20), a resident of La Casa Latina, said that Asian-American HOME is not guaranteed year to year in the same way as Black House and La Casa Latina, which have a level of permanence.
The Asian-American HOME will serve as a welcoming space for Asian-American students, according to Jamyson Smith (COL ’22), a GUSA senator.
“By having this space it will create almost like a safety net and place of understanding for Asian Americans,” Smith wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is especially important when being a minority in a space like Georgetown because it provides a location that is home like and inviting. It can give a sense of compassion and body in which one can truly feel as if they belong.”
APILF is a forum open to anyone who identifies as Pacific Islander, Asian or Asian-American, including Southwest Asian and Central Asian individuals, according to the APLIF website. 
The approval comes among other campaigns launched by APILF, including a February push for an Asian-American Studies department at Georgetown. The student-run photo campaign, which aimed to draw attention to the lack of academic programming on Asian-American studies, was organized in collaboration with the Georgetown Asian-American Student Association’s Political Awareness Committee, an affinity group for Georgetown students of Asian descent. 
The existence of affinity houses for Georgetown students is consequential for minority students on campus, according to Kendell Long (COL ’19), a resident of Black House.
“It was nice to have a space where I know I can find people that look like me,” Long wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Having affinity spaces with minority identities are really important at predominantly white institutions like Georgetown.”
Smith agreed with Long that affinity homes forge vital communities for minority students at Georgetown.
“For students, it is potentially more than just a home, it is more than just a living arrangement, it could be a source of spirit, connection, kinship, and even culture,” Smith wrote.
Although there are organizations on campus that promote equity, there is something special about living with others that share an identity, according to Long.
“There is some power in seeing people that look like you in leadership positions,” Long said.  “There is power in a physical space.”

Two panels of filmmakers, Georgetown professors and former inmates discussed the rehabilitative power of education in the prison system March 11.
The event featured the public debut of director Lynn Novick’s four-part PBS documentary College Behind Bars, excerpts of which were shown to an audience in Gaston Hall. 
Novick, an Emmy-winning documentary filmmaker, spent six years shooting footage of students and educators in the Bard Prison Initiative, a program launched by Bard College that offers degrees to incarcerated people in the New York state prison system. BPI reorients the goal of incarceration away from punishment and toward rehabilitation, according to Novick. 
“This film raises two important questions: What is prison for? And who in our society has access to education?” Novick said. “And over the course of making this film, we gained a deeper understanding of the transformative power of education.”
With over 2.3 million individuals in jails and prisons, the United States has the highest documented incarceration rate in the world, according to a March 2017 news release from the Prison Policy Initiative, a criminal justice policy think tank. The liberal arts education BPI provides aims to lower this recidivism rate and reintegrate inmates into society, according to Novick.
Novick spoke on a panel with Max Kenner, BPI executive director, and Jule Hall, BPI alumnus and program associate for gender, racial and ethnic justice at the Ford Foundation, a charitable institution that seeks to advance human welfare. The panel was moderated by Ken Burns, executive producer of Novick’s documentary.
Programs like BPI have had demonstrable success at reducing re-incarceration rates. Incarcerated individuals who received correctional education were 43 percent less likely to return to prison within three years than those who did not receive education, according to a 2013 study from the RAND Corporation, a policy analysis think tank.
Hall, who completed a BPI undergraduate degree in German studies in 2011, said the philosophers he studied at BPI allowed him to better understand himself. 
“Walter Mosley, Friedrich Nietzsche, the social sciences, the philosophies — allow me to understand myself and articulate what is going on inside me,” Hall said. “Those were the tools I used to be able to say, ‘This is me, and this is the world I exist in.’”
Brian Ferguson (COL ’18), a Georgetown graduate who was wrongfully convicted of homicide and spent 11 years in prison, echoed a famous champion of freedom in his assessment of the relationship between being educated and being free.
“One of my heroes, Frederick Douglass, said that education is the key to freedom, and I really believe that,” Ferguson said. 
Ferguson spoke on a second panel that was moderated by University President John J. DeGioia. Panelists included Marc Howard, a Georgetown professor of government and law, Shon Hopwood, an associate professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center, and George Chochos, BPI alumnus and assistant director of Georgetown’s Pivot Program, which connects former inmates to classes and internships.
The chance to receive a postsecondary education in prison is limited. Among state prisons, 35 percent offer college level courses, and only six percent of inmates participate in these programs, according to the Vera Institute of Justice, an organization dedicated to improving the U.S. justice system.
Being in prison reduced his life to a statistic, according to Chochos. 
“Experiencing reality through metal bars is very difficult. Prisons are constant reminders of your dehumanized status. I wasn’t George Chochos; I was a number,” Chochos said.
Chocos attributed the positive shift in his perception of his role in society to the education he received through BPI.
“Somehow, what I had to say — my scholarship and my voice — could have meaning; somehow my life could add value to society. I could transcend a number,” Chochos said.
The panelists spoke about a number of initiatives Georgetown has started over the last couple of years to help inmates in prison and to help former inmates adjust to life after incarceration. 
Howard founded Georgetown’s Prisons and Justice Initiative, an initiative dedicated to studying and addressing the issue of mass incarceration, in 2016. The Pivot Program, which was established in collaboration with the Prisons and Justice Initiative in November 2018, is a fellowship that helps formerly incarcerated individuals become productive leaders in society. The program offers non-credit-bearing certificates in business and entrepreneurship for formerly incarcerated individuals. 
The MORCA-Georgetown paralegal program, a paralegal certification project run by the university and Washington, D.C.’s mayor’s office of returning citizen affairs, began in October 2018. Additionally, the Georgetown Prison Scholars program, which launched in January 2018, offers courses and lectures at D.C. jails. 
In 2015, former President Barack Obama’s administration announced a pilot program to give Pell Grants, government-funded scholarships for college education, to 12,000 incarcerated U.S. citizens. Pell Grants had been unavailable to inmates since the 1994 Higher Education Act.
However, the government-sponsored initiative is insufficient in addressing the scale of the problem, according to Kenner.
“In America we suffer from a real cynicism about the role of education itself,” Kenner said. “So when people look at education or college in prison, they’re looking at a person that’s a problem because they committed a crime, or a problem that’s a set of institutions because they’re very expensive to the taxpayer.”

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has been testing automatic doors on trains in the Washington, D.C. area over the last three weeks as part of a plan to reintroduce automatic doors by the end of the year. 
The transition back to automatic doors would shorten wait times and reduce rider risk, according to a March 4 WMATA news release. Without automatic doors, drivers may open the doors on the wrong side of the track, which could produce injury and increase commute times, according to Ian Jannetta, WMATA media relations manager. 
The automatic doors were first implemented during WMATA’s launch in 1976 as part of the automatic train operation system, which gave trains self-driving capabilities. The system was discontinued after a 2008 accident at the Fort Totten station, where two trains crashed into each other following a system signaling error. The incident killed eight passengers and the train operator. Regarded as the deadliest in WMATA’s history, the accident forced the organization to reexamine its entire operations systems and discontinue automatic train operations, according to DCist.  
While train operators will still be in charge of closing doors, installing automatic doors reduces the interactions that operators have with machinery, which results in safety benefits, according to Jannetta.
“Metrorail operators initiate an ‘open doors’ command more than 20,000 times each weekday,” Jannetta wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While rare, there have been instances where operators have temporarily lost awareness and accidentally opened doors on the wrong side of the train, something that the automatic system prevents.”
Although WMATA officially announced their plans for installing automatic doors in 2018, the organization has planned to transition back to automatic trains for several years now, according to The Washington Post.
WMATA aims to restore the automatic train operation system because of its potential to shorten wait times and enhance customer experience, according to the news release. 
“Following a series of wrong-side door incidents several years ago, Metro began training operators to pause several seconds prior to opening the doors,” the news release read. “However, for customers, there is now a delay of several seconds between the train arriving at the station and the doors opening.”
To ensure the safety of its return to automated doors, WMATA plans to introduce a system to disable automatic features outside of rush hour and train its operators on navigating the system, according to the Washington Post. WMATA still plans to have operators on board to monitor the systems, make announcements and close doors.
The automatic doors are set to be implemented system-wide after undergoing additional testing, according to Jannetta. 
“Additional testing will be conducted over the next several weeks, along with ongoing train operator familiarization,” Janetta wrote. “If all goes well, Metro expects to return to system wide use of the auto-doors feature later this year.”
Reinstituting automatic train operation is one of several plans to increase ridership on Metro, which now competes with rideshare services such as Uber and Lyft. Other potential initiatives included creating an all-day peak service, allowing users to make payments through a mobile app and giving ride credits to customers whose trip is more than 10 minutes late, The Washington Post reported.

An open letter requesting Washington, D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) step down as National Committeeman of the D.C. Democratic Party was published March 6, following allegations that he misused his position to solicit corporate deals.
Evans is the councilmember who represents the neighbourhoods including Georgetown, Dupont Circle and Foggy Bottom, among other areas. 
The letter, addressed to Evans, was signed by 23 members of the D.C. Democratic State Committee after accusations that Evans used his position in government leadership to solicit business deals from private firms publicly surfaced Feb. 28.
A grand jury subpoenaed documents relating to legislation benefiting Digi Outdoor Media, a digital commercial advertising firm, last September. Evans said he returned money and stock shares that he received from the digital sign company before introducing the legislation in a text message to The Washington Post.
Evans should step down because his compromised reputation will jeopardize the momentum of legislation addressing important D.C. issues such as statehood, according to Zachary Israel, a D.C. Young Democrats national committeeman. Israel signed the open letter to Evans.
“There are many individuals who are better able to serve and represent us on the Democratic National Committee, and the time has come for him to do the right thing and step down for the good of the party,” Israel wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
D.C. Working Families, a progressive advocacy group that seeks to raise living standards for working families, drafted and released a petition March 6 calling for Evans to be stripped of his chairmanship of the Committee on Finance and Revenue. The petition also requested Evans be removed from his position on the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety. 
The focus on Evans has distracted from D.C. efforts for initiatives such as the push for statehood, and have jeopardized voter trust in the Democratic party, according to the letter.
“The clouds growing over your alleged activities complicate efforts to win D.C. Statehood, determine D.C.’s position in the primary calendar and restore the faith of D.C. voters that their local Democratic Party leadership puts their interests first,” the letter read.
A representative from Evans’ office declined to comment on the accusations.
The allegations and open letter have received mixed responses. President of D.C. Young Democrats Marcus Goodwin said the letter was premature because the allegations against Evans have not yet received a comprehensive investigation, according to The Washington Post. 
D.C. Council Chair Phil Mendelson (D) announced he would reprimand Evans in a March 5 news release. However, Mendelson did not call for Evans to resign.
“Our Code of Conduct states explicitly that a Councilmember ‘may not knowingly use the prestige of office or public position for [his] private gain,’ and that government resources shall not be used for personal business,” Mendelson said. “This reprimand will send a clear message that Mr. Evans’ actions are not only unacceptable but are inconsistent with the Council’s ethical standards.”
Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) disapproved of Mendelson’s plan to reprimand Evans, calling for a special council investigation into Evans’ alleged wrongdoing in a March 5 news release. 
“Chairman Mendelson’s proposed reprimand of Councilmember Evans is merely a slap on the wrist, allowing the Council to check a box and move on,” Grosso said. “It stops short of any real accountability as Councilmember Evans will remain at the helm of the powerful Finance and Revenue Committee from which he peddled his influence using the prestige of his office.”
A full investigation is unnecessary because Evans’ emails to businesses clearly demonstrated a violation of conduct, according to Mendelson.
“Some have suggested that I should appoint a special committee to investigate the matter,. However, there is no question whether Mr. Evans’ emails violated the Council’s Code of Conduct, and therefore waiting for an investigation would be an unnecessary delay,” Mendelson said in the news release. 
Evans’ behavior reflects poorly on the councils’ public image and makes it impossible for him to continue in his position, according to the letter. 
“The Council cannot afford to have decisions made by a committee as consequential as Finance and Revenue continue to be marred by questions of impropriety or influence peddling,” the letter said. “The Council also cannot have someone who is under grand jury investigation overseeing government ethics via a post on the Judiciary committee.”

Washington, D.C. Councilmember Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) introduced a bill in the D.C. Council to allow minors to get vaccinated without parental approval March 5. 
The proposed legislation, entitled the “Minor Consent for Vaccinations Amendment Act of 2019,” would allow any minor who understands the need for and the nature of a vaccine as well as the risks associated with it to receive a vaccination from their doctor. 
Current D.C. law allows minors to receive health services such as abortions, treatment for substance abuse and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. However, decisions regarding vaccinations require an individual to be at least 18 years old, according to a Feb. 5 news release by Cheh’s office. 
Some families choose not to vaccinate their children because they believe that vaccines may cause autism or have other harmful health effects, according to Cheh. 
“Vaccinations are perhaps our most effective and essential tool to prevent a number of communicable and deadly or debilitating diseases,” Cheh wrote in the news release. “Anti-science beliefs not only put unvaccinated children at risk of contracting deadly diseases, but lead to the spread of diseases that have been all but eradicated.”
The bill comes in light of an ongoing measles outbreak in 12 states and concern for the outbreak to spread into D.C., a large source of tourism in the United States.
The World Health Organization named vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019. The proportion of children who have not received vaccinations by the age of 24 months, though low, has grown, according to an October 2018 report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
High school student Ethan Lindenberger, who chose to get himself vaccinated after his 18th birthday, testified in front of the Senate Committee on Health, Education Labor and Pensions on March 5, according to USA Today. While Lindenberger’s mother was an anti-vaccination advocate, Lindenberger found scientific research which debunked her claims, leading him to get vaccinated. 
“My mother is an anti-vaxx advocate that believes that vaccines cause autism, brain damage and do not benefit the health and safety of society,” Lindenberger said in his testimony. “As I began to approach high school and think more critically for myself, I saw that the information in defense of vaccines outweighed the concerns, heavily.”
A similar bill was introduced by New York State Assemblywoman Patricia Fahy (D) in the New York State Assembly on March 8. Similar measures have already been adopted by California, Washington and Oregon.
Critics of the measures have cited concern over allowing minors to make their own health decisions. Laws in California and Oregon require the minor to be above the age of 14 or 15, depending on the state, or to be evaluated to ensure that the minor is mature enough to make the decision to vaccinate, according to WAMU, the primary NPR member station for D.C.
Children who wish to be immunized should have the right to receive vaccinations, Cheh said.
“A child who wishes to be immunized should not be put at risk when his or her parent is unwilling or unable to vaccinate,” Cheh said in the news release. “Access to these important and sometimes life-saving treatments should not be withheld in the District of Columbia.”
The bill currently has eight co-sponsors, among them former mayor and current Councilmember Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7) and Chairman of the D.C. Council, Phil Mendelson (D). The next step for the bill is a review and markup in the Committee on Health, chaired by Gray.
There is no timeline currently set for the proposed legislation; however, the bill is expected to draw public attention as the bill must face a hearing and two council votes before being enacted as law, according to WAMU.

I am nurse practitioner and have worked in a  DC school setting in the past and have deep concerns about this proposed bill.
> the state should not have control over children, parents should.
> parents have a right to know what substance is being put in their child.  As an NP I have learned that every “body” is different…medications  that  are safe for some have adverse reactions in others
> what has happened to “informed consent”
>children do not have the wisdom to understand the good or ill of vaccines
> if a child has a vaccine reaction,  who is going to take care of that child, the state? The potential legal ramifications are staggering.
> how much of this all pushed by the pharmaceutical companies?  Look at the opiate epidemic and the cover-up with that.   Do we trust them them empirically with our children?

Georgetown University Law Center Professor Alicia Plerhoples was endorsed by grassroots advocacy group VA Democracy Forward in her bid for chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, the highest governing body of Fairfax, Va., on March 2.
VA Democracy Forward, a group that promotes progressive candidates, joins Jennifer Carroll Foy, a delegate in the Virginia House of delegates, in supporting Plerhoples’ campaign. Foy is headlining a March 30 campaign fundraiser for Plerhoples.
Plerhoples had previously announced her candidacy for Fairfax County’s School Board, but suspended her campaign Feb. 15 to run for chairman of the county board instead, a switch motivated by a desire for her ideas to have a wider platform.
“I had previously been running for school board but realized that my skill sets around community economic development are much more better suited for chairman, and that I can make a bigger and larger and more meaningful impact as chairman,” Plerhoples said in an interview with The Hoya.
Plerhoples, a woman of color, began her campaign in the face of the impending retirement of Catherine Hudgins, the only person of color on Fairfax County’s Board of Supervisors. She launched her campaign because of the lack of candidates discussing the issues that matter in her eyes to the county. 
“I also looked at the field of the candidates that were in the race and, as a resident of Fairfax County, I didn’t see anyone that I would vote for or anyone that was talking about the issues that I really care about, which includes the affordability of the county,” Plerhoples said.
Fairfax County must help its disadvantaged communities that face important hurdles in economic security, according to Plerhoples. 
“I am running for Chairman because I want to close the gap,” Plerhoples wrote in a Facebook post announcing her candidacy. “Because there are two Fairfax Counties, divided by economic security and opportunity. ” 
Plerhoples’ time at Georgetown Law has given her the motivation and experience to run for office.
“Certainly my time teaching at Georgetown has encouraged me to run for this position, and I think it’s really because some of the work that I do at the law school is directly transferable to the skillset for chairman,” Plerhoples said. 
Plerhoples is the director of the Social Enterprise and Nonprofit Law Clinic at Georgetown, which supports the economic growth of small businesses, social enterprises and nonprofit organizations in the Washington, D.C., area through providing free legal assistance. 
While at Georgetown Law, Plerhoples has chaired the Diversity Committee and co-taught “Campaigning for Public Office,” a class that simulates running for public office, with Zakiya Thomas, who now serves as her campaign manager. Plerhoples said she started the course with Thomas because of an uptick in interest among students in entering public office and government service.
To focus on her campaign, Plerhoples will be on sabbatical through the Democratic primary on June 11.
Fairfax County is one of the prosperous counties among its peers, with an average median household income of about $117,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. However, Plerhoples describes two distinct realities of the County: one that is affluent and enjoys strong economic development, and one that does not enjoy Fairfax’s overall economic prosperity.
“We are one of the wealthiest counties in the country, but that masks some of the realities on the ground of our county,” Plerhoples said.
The mean income of the top 20 percent of earners in Fairfax county is over 11 times higher than the bottom 20 percent of earners, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve data. 
Despite the county’s prosperity, certain districts have poverty rates that reach as high as 14 percent house thousands of students who receive free or reduced price school lunch. The county needs to do more to help these communities, according to Plerhoples.
Plerhoples said she hopes to continue this work as chairman through focusing on affordable housing, early childhood education and growth that addresses the threat of climate change.
“Under my leadership, Fairfax County can become the leader in the region for stemming the effects of income inequality — by investing in affordable and workforce housing, universal preschool, and economic growth that addresses the existential threat of climate change,” Plerhoples wrote on her campaign website.
This article was updated March 22 to correct Foy’s involvement in Plerhoples’ campaign.

As a 2009 alumn who is running for local office this year as well, I couldn’t be prouder to call Alicia friend and support her in her race for Chair of Fairfax County! Hoya Saxa!
