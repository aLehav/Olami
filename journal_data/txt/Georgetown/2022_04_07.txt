The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate voted against holding yet another student referendum to restructure GUSA at an April 4 meeting. 
The proposed referendum, which fell short of passing by two votes, would create policy committees and appoint student representatives to university boards, councils and committees. The goal of the proposal was to restructure GUSA to be more accessible, as well as increase involvement and participation in the organization. 
Restructuring through a student referendum is the best way to make meaningful changes to GUSA, according to GUSA Senator Bora Balçay (SFS ’23), who introduced the bill.
“I think the biggest problem that we face right now is an excess of bureaucracy and a lack of direction,” Balçay said in an interview with The Hoya. “Few people in a very large organization are dedicated to the actual path, and unless we fundamentally change how we do things, I don’t think that can be solved. I think it is very easy to get involved on the ground level, but I think it is impossible, if you’re a dedicated person, to be satisfied with the institutional constraints of the organization.”
Still, GUSA Senator Zev Burton (SFS ’22), who voted against the referendum, said the primary issue with GUSA is not its structure, but rather low involvement from current members. 
“When you have a third of senators not showing up, that’s as big a red flag,” Burton told The Hoya. “The real issue here isn’t students wanting to be a part of GUSA. It’s just that once they’re part of it, once they have that title of senator, they don’t actually show up. Restructuring doesn’t get rid of the lack of willingness to show up and do the work like that.”
GUSA previously attempted to restructure itself through a student referendum that failed Nov. 7 due to lack of student turnout, with only 20.11% of the student body voting in the election, which fell short of the required 25%. 
Unlike the previous referendum, which called to abolish the GUSA Senate and Executive and replace the bodies with a student activist assembly, the most recent proposal would have maintained the GUSA Senate and Executive. 
If the recent referendum had gone to the student body and succeeded, it would have increased enthusiasm for GUSA, thus promoting student involvement in the organization, according to Balçay.
“We would have seen a lot more excitement around elections in the first place. Also, we would have a lot more dedication and a lower turnover rate,” Balçay said. “As is, too many people are on tasks that really don’t make sense and don’t really deserve their time.”
However, Burton said that the referendum failing to make it out of the Senate is a victory for both GUSA and the student body.
“I think it was rushed, and I think it would be too embarrassing if it were to have gone to the student body and failed again,” Burton said. “I think the student body has already weighed in. Let’s move on. Let’s start working on getting textbooks into people’s hands and getting laptops — stuff we can actually change. If we want to improve the perception of GUSA, doing internal restructuring isn’t going to solve that issue.”
GUSA President Kole Wolfe (SFS ’24), who remains in favor of GUSA restructuring, said it is necessary for the organization to effectively serve students.
“Some senators believed that we would not be able to reach the minimum number of votes needed to pass a referendum, and said that this failure would be ‘embarrassing’ for GUSA,” Wolfe wrote to The Hoya. “I believe in, and vocalized, the notion that we should be more concerned about be able to fulfill our duty to adequately provide for student need instead of public opinion surrounding GUSA, especially when we are already generally viewed in an unfavorable light.”
Wolfe said GUSA leadership plans to reintroduce similar legislation again in the fall and will focus on internal reform in the meantime.

When Siena Hohne (COL ’22) discovered transphobic protesters had gathered outside of Georgetown University’s front gates, she immediately put on her “Homo Saxa” sweatshirt and brought a speaker to the front gates, where she blared Lady Gaga’s “Born this Way.”
Hohne was joined by around two dozen other Georgetown community members to oppose a group of protesters from the anti-LGBTQ organization American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property (American TFP). Around 11 TFP representatives had gathered around noon April 4 outside Georgetown’s front gates at 37th and O St. NW, holding signs that read “God created them Male & Female. Stop the ravages of transgender ideology.”
With origins dating back to 1971, the American TFP, which is part of a larger international TFP, describes itself as “an organization of lay Catholic Americans concerned about the moral crisis shaking the remnants of Christian civilization,” according to the group’s website. TFP did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment.
Hohne, former co-president of GU Pride, said it is important that students joined the counterprotest to stand in solidarity with transgender people, especially given the rise of anti-trans bills being introduced across the country. 
“The counterprotest is a really essential thing for allies to do to show that we do love trans folks here, that we love kids — that we are not going to let these people get away with spreading lies and hate, just ruining people’s day,” Hohne told The Hoya. 
The American TFP strongly opposes gay and transgender rights, and “pro-homosexual clubs on Catholic college campuses,” according to their website. 
For transgender students at Georgetown like Elliott Lloyd (COL ’24) the presense of transphobic protesters outside of Georgetown’s front gates was especially distressing. 
“This incident was particularly disturbing just to see how much hate people really have,” Lloyd said in an interview with The Hoya. “And as an openly trans student on campus, it definitely did not make me feel safe to go to that protest.” 
Lloyd, who joined counterprotesters after hearing about it in the “Gaytown” Georgetown student GroupMe, a group chat, said it is important to stand in solidarity against transphobia, especially given the rise of anti-transgender legislation being introduced across the country.   
“We want to stand up so that trans students at Georgetown know that we’re welcome and an important part of the community,” Lloyd said. 
Since the start of 2022, almost 240 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in state legislatures across the United States, with more than half specifically targeting transgender people. In comparison, 41 bills similar to these were introduced in 2018, and 191 were introduced in 2021. 
Georegetown has no affiliation with the TFP, according to a university spokesperson, and condemns the beliefs of the organization.  
“As an institution that values interreligious understanding, inclusion and respect for all persons, we find the viewpoints of this group offensive, degrading and hateful,” the spokesperson wrote. 
Gracie Coughlin (COL ’22), who joined counterprotesters at the front gates after hearing about the transphobic protest from a friend, said protests like these are harmful to students. 
“People telling you that your identity isn’t real is just really hurtful to students. And trans people have been facing this for all of time. So I feel like we’ve got to stop,” Coughlin said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Transgender people, especially transgender people of color, have historically been excluded from the LGBTQ community, even though those communities have been at the forefront of the fight for LGBTQ rights for decades. Through the civil rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s white, cisgender gay and lesbian rights activists acively excluded trans people from their activism.  
Georgetown’s LGBTQ Resource Center, which provides support for LGBTQ members of the Georgetown community, condemned the TFP protests in an April 5 email.
“However, what we witnessed yesterday is a clear example of what many Trans people live with on a daily basis, we witnessed the hatred and bigotry that continues to be present in our country,” the LGBTQ Resource Center wrote in the statement. “We want to remind all our Trans students that you belong here, you are welcomed, and you are loved.”
The university could not take action against protesters standing outside of campus grounds, according to a university spokesperson. 
“While external protestors have the right to stand on the sidewalk outside of the front gates, which is public property, they are not permitted to enter campus,” the spokesperson wrote. “GUPD officers continuously monitored the situation to ensure protestors remained off campus property.”
Lloyd said Georgetown should be doing more to support transgender students, including providing more gender-neutral bathrooms on campus and changing housing policies. 
“I’m facing a lot of transphobia, pretty much on a weekly basis. I’ve been called a lot of slurs here. I faced a lot of harassment. And that sort of made me a little frustrated to see some of the same people who hadn’t really done anything in those instances show up sort of only in this case, when it was protesters from outside Georgetown,” Lloyd said.  
The campus community has the responsibility to fight transphobia everyday, Lloyd said. 
“I sort of wish that people would also make an everyday commitment to looking at how they can fight against transphobia. And other moments in their life, not just moments like these,” Lloyd said.

The Georgetown University College Academic Council recognized Professor Erin Cline with the College Honors for her meaningful impact on students. 
Each year, undergraduate students in the College can vote for up to three professors for the award, selecting those who have most influenced their academic experience at Georgetown. This is the 16th iteration of the award.
Cline, a professor of philosophy and theology who specializes in Chinese philosophy, received the most votes in this year’s award cycle. 
Cline said she is grateful to her students for nominating her for the award. 
“I am deeply honored by this award especially because it comes from the students. One of my colleagues told me he thinks it is the most important award Georgetown gives, for that reason. I have a deep affection for my past, present and future students and so it means the world to me,” Cline wrote to The Hoya. 
Cline said she shares the honor with her fellow colleagues in the theology department. 
“I am also grateful to teach alongside so many other excellent teachers in Theology & Religious Studies who inspire me and from whom I have learned much, and so I share this award with my department,” Cline wrote. 
Kate Chaillet (COL ’23), was a student in Cline’s Ignatius seminar, “Human Flourishing: East and West,” which focused on what it means to live a deep and fulfilling life, as well as what it takes for the spirit to flourish amid challenges like poverty, grief and disability.  
Chaillet said she is grateful for how Cline and the course gave her the tools to make the most of her time at Georgetown. 
“This class afforded me a place to slow down, reflect, and think deeply about how I wanted to live my life and the person I wanted to be over the next four years and beyond,” Chaillet wrote to The Hoya. “The thing that struck me most about Professor Cline’s teaching style was her incredible ability to listen. She listened carefully to each and every student. And, rather than respond right away to a student’s comments, she often allowed for silence.”  
The course specifically drew on lessons from a variety of Buddhist, Confucian, ancient Greek and Jewish traditions. 
Cline hopes that through her courses her students can derive life lessons from the classroom. 
“My pedagogy is deeply Ignatian. I aim to teach the whole person, and to practice cura personalis in my classes,” Cline wrote. “I also aim to get students to take seriously the idea that there is a spiritual dimension of human life, and that the spirit, like the body, needs exercise, as Ignatius of Loyola argued.”
Lin Henke (COL ’23) took an Ignatius seminar, “Introduction to Chinese Philosophy and Advanced Readings in Chinese Philosophy,” with Cline. Cline will also serve as Henke’s thesis advisor next year. 
Henke, who voted for Cline to win the award, admires her personal approach to teaching, which helped to engage students in the coursework. 
“Professor Cline is a very warm and expressive teacher. She brings in examples from her personal life and checks in with us about our own lives,” Henke wrote to The Hoya.
Lucy Doyle (COL ’22), president of the College Academic Council, said the award is meant to strengthen ties between professors and students. 
“College Honors is a perfect example of what we aim to do: showcase the reciprocal relationship between students and the college, and celebrate how professors and students contribute to and improve each other’s academic experiences at Georgetown,” Doyle wrote to The Hoya. 
Cline hopes she can continue to foster close relationships with her students to facilitate insightful learning.  
“I strive for students to find me approachable partly by sharing of myself openly in my teaching,” Cline wrote. “I find that they respond in kind, and all of us learn more deeply when we feel that we have a safe space to share our experiences openly—and in order to best interrogate the truth, beauty and goodness in different texts, we need that kind of openness.”

The Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy launched a community lecture series that will focus on fostering community dialogue about inclusion as it relates to democracy, politics and policy. 
Each event will feature a speaker sharing their perspective on and experience with community inclusion, followed by comments from a member of the McCourt School faculty and a question-and-answer session.
The series aims to foster a dialogue among community members and the public, all of whom can attend the events to gain a better understanding of inclusion, according to Sharon Mar, chief of staff at the McCourt School.
“Our goal with these community lecture series is to build a more inclusive community and more importantly develop the knowledge and skills so our community can engage in productive dialogues,” Mar wrote to The Hoya.
The series provides a space for students, community members and the public to engage in lectures and question-and-answer sessions that expand community understanding, according to Maria Cancian, dean of the McCourt School.
“As part of our commitment to inclusion, the McCourt School established this new public lecture series to provide a forum for community dialogue on a wide range of topics,” Cancian wrote to The Hoya.
The inaugural event in the community lecture series took place April 6 featuring speaker Wendy Castillo, senior director of equity, data and impact​ at the ​National Urban League, exploring the intersection between inclusion and data analysis. Castillo discussed QuantCrit, a field of study that seeks to apply Critical Race Theory to improve the use of statistical data in social research. Nora Gordon, professor at the McCourt School, offered a follow-up after Castillo’s lecture before Cancian moderated a question-and-answer session. 
During the lecture, Castillo said it is crucial to consider the impact of a researcher’s own background when analyzing their work and data.
“Who are the researchers?” Castillo said at the event. “What are their backgrounds? And how might their backgrounds really be influencing the assumptions that they are making? Whose interests are being displayed in the research agenda? Who is benefiting from the research agenda? Who is funding them? And who is their prime audience?”
Castillo said that she encourages researchers to always include positionality statements in quantitative research to make the answers to these questions more transparent. 
“The idea of a positionality statement is to reflect on your position in society and think about your biases, your blind spots, it’s also about exploring the position you have, but also the power you have in society,” Castillo said during her lecture.
According to Castillo, remaining cognizant of existing racial biases influences the way we view data. 
“Numbers are not neutral, because at every point in the process of collecting and analyzing and interpreting numbers, decisions are made and categories are given,” Castillo said at the event. “We choose the categories, and those are arbitrary. There’s not something that is telling us to choose. We are deciding that subjective choice. Voice and insight data cannot speak for itself. We speak for data; the numbers are accurate.”
In September, the community lecture series will host Randall Kennedy, a Harvard Law School professor and the author of “Say It Loud! On Race, Law, History, and Culture.” Kennedy will discuss the intersection of race and the law. The McCourt School plans to continue hosting lectures, making this an ongoing series.
Gordon hopes that the takeaway from the lecture is to consider a variety of factors before analyzing research results.
“I hope students will take away that with the power of interpreting and analyzing data comes important responsibility,” Gordon wrote to The Hoya.

The McCourt School of Public Policy climbed seven places in rankings compared to last year to reach the top 5% of all public affairs programs in the United States this year.
The U.S. News and World Report, which publishes annual rankings of the best colleges and graduate schools based on various criteria such as academic reputation and peer assessment scores, ranked the McCourt School in 12th place for public affairs programs. 
Barbara Schone, associate dean for academic affairs at the McCourt School, said she credits the increase in ranking to the school’s expansion over the past few years. 
“The McCourt School has been an area of growth at Georgetown that has happened, in part, due to the generous gifts by alumnus Frank McCourt (who just gave his second $100 million to the McCourt School last spring),” Schone wrote to The Hoya. “These gifts have enabled us to invest in ways that are unique. Our move to the Capitol Campus in a brand new building in the summer of 2024 will also enable us to be at the center of policymaking in DC.”
Maria Cancian, dean of the McCourt School, said she was pleased to see the improved rankings and acknowledgment of the school’s dedicated faculty.
“Our mission at the McCourt School is to provide a world-class education,” Cancian said in a statement to the McCourt School. “I am delighted to see the work of our faculty, researchers, students and alumni continue to be acknowledged by U.S. News voters as we strive to solve the most pressing challenges of our time and help shape more equitable and inclusive communities in the U.S. and around the world.” 
The school’s inclusive and diverse community and location in Washington, D.C., make it stand out from other public policy programs, according to Schone.
“We have an unusual community of students, alumni, faculty, and staff that are committed to policymaking,” Schone wrote. “Further, being able to study public policy in Washington, DC, is hard to beat whether one is interested in domestic or international policy. We also have a strong commitment to making the McCourt School the most inclusive Public Policy school in the nation.”
The rankings are based solely on peer assessment data from academics and leadership within public policy programs across the country. Because of this, Schone said she believes that the rankings might not reflect all of the McCourt School program’s strengths. 
“The rankings can be somewhat idiosyncratic since they aren’t based on concrete criteria,” Schone wrote. “I would say that we pay some attention to the rankings, but we also realize that due to their idiosyncratic nature, they might not reflect all of the strengths of our program. It is hard to know from year to year how the rankings will adjust.”
In addition to ranking graduate schools overall, the U.S. News and World Report ranks specialty areas for programs of excellence. This year, the McCourt School ranked 4th in International Policy and Administration, 11th in Public Policy Analysis, 13th in Social Policy, 14th in Health Policy and Management and 14th in Public Management and Leadership. 
Atsuhiro Oguri (GRD ’22), who is studying International Development Policy at the McCourt School, was particularly excited to hear about the improvement of the International Policy and Administration ranking, as the field aligns with his interests and career goals.  
“The MIDP at McCourt stood out to me with its unique program design when compared to other master’s schools,” Oguri wrote to The Hoya. “I have enjoyed its well-structured curriculum with its strong focus on quantitative analysis. Also, the small cohort size and collaborative atmosphere have allowed me to build a tight-knit community with incredibly talented cohorts.”
The success of a variety of programs at the McCourt School reflect the dedication of the faculty and students, according to Schone. 
“These are areas that have been core strengths at the McCourt School for quite some time,” Schone wrote. “We have a wide array of faculty doing exciting research in these areas, and I believe that the rankings reflect that work.”
Schone said that she attributes the large improvement, particularly in the Public Management and Leadership ranking, to the recent faculty hires over the last few years.
“I am extraordinarily confident that the investments that we are making at the McCourt School will continue to pay off in terms of the quality of the educational experience we provide our students,” Schone wrote.

The dean of the Georgetown University Law Center (GULC) signed onto a letter urging the Biden administration to end the use of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Title 42 public health order, an immigrant expulsion policy established during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Dean William Treanor signed onto the letter, which was signed by leaders at 14 Jesuit law and immigrant advocacy institutions, including Fordham University School of Law, Boston College Law School and Loyola University Chicago School of Law, on March 30. Two days later, on April 1, the Biden administration announced that it would end its use of Title 42, which was first implemented under the Trump administration in March 2020. 
Title 42 has been harmful to migrants seeking to enter the United States, according to the letter.  
“The harms visited on vulnerable migrants by the Title 42 Order are extensive and well-documented. From March 2020 to February 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported more than 1 million expulsions at the U.S. Southwest land border under Title 42,” the letter reads. 
The order, which the Trump administration implemented in March 2020 terminated migrants’ rights to enter the United States. The Trump administration said the order was intended to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission at border stations and detention centers. 
The order has allowed border control authorities to bypass typical immigration screening measures, allowing them to expel border crossers to their countries of origin or Mexico without allowing them to seek humanitarian protection. 
The letter expressed concern about the Biden administration’s continued use of the order in expelling migrants seeking humanitarian protection at the U.S.-Mexico border. Detailing the harms the order has caused migrants seeking to enter the United States, the letter argues that migrants do not pose a serious threat to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. 
Treanor, who wrote the quote alongside Fordham Law School Dean Matthew Diller, said he believed the voices of Jesuit institutions would impact Biden.
“It was our belief that the voice of Jesuit law school deans would be singularly important, particularly to President Biden, as we called for the immediate rescission of the Title 42 Order and the protection of refugees, the promotion of justice, and adherence to rule of law principles,” Treanor wrote to The Hoya.
GULC Professor Elisa Massimino was proud to see GULC call for the end of what she viewed as a cruel and unnecessary order. 
“The use of Title 42 was a cruel and cynical ploy by the Trump administration to shut down access to refugee protection at the southern border,” Massimino wrote to The Hoya. “It has been condemned by public health experts as unnecessary and counterproductive. I was proud to see our dean and other leaders of Jesuit institutions call for an end to it.” 
Since the legal provision’s enactment it has been used to expel over 1 million people seeking humanitarian protection. 
The CDC announced that termination of the order will be implemented beginning May 23. The CDC decided to end the order after considering current public health conditions and increased tools that can be used to fight COVID-19, including vaccines and therapeutics. 
Jesuit institutions have been advocating for the end of Title 42 since its implementation, according to Giulia McPherson, director of advocacy and operations at Jesuit Refugee Service/USA (JRS/USA), an international Catholic organization that supports and advocates for refugees and forcibly displaced persons around the world, who signed onto the letter.  
“Jesuit Refugee Service/USA welcomes last week’s determination by the Centers for Disease Control to terminate Title 42,” McPherson wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “Since its implementation in March 2020, JRS/USA has advocated alongside partner organizations and fellow Jesuit institutions for the U.S. government to rescind this harmful policy.”
McPherson said that her organization is ready to support asylum seekers impacted by this change in policy through psychosocial and legal assistance.
“Throughout this transition, we will continue to urge the Administration to place the rights of asylum seekers at the center of all policy decisions,” McPherson wrote.
Treanor said it was overwhelming to see so much support from peer institutions. 
“This call reflected the core Jesuit principle of commitment to the protection of all people. We were both overwhelmed, but not surprised, by the enthusiastic support we received from our colleagues at other Jesuit law schools, and we were delighted by the Administration’s decision,” Treanor wrote.

The Georgetown University Initiative on Tech and Society is hosting Tech and Society Week, a festival demonstrating the challenges and opportunities within technology. 
This week of events, which started April 4 and ends April 8, includes workshops, research presentations, lectures and multiple virtual events exploring the issues of technology and society. The student-run event included programming from Georgetown professors and organizations. 
The Georgetown Ethics Lab, the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation, and the Institute for Technology Law and Policy all helped with programming for the event. 
Evagelia Tavoulareas, the managing chair of the initiative, said the week of events will help to connect students and professors on the topic of technology. 
“There is so much great work happening across the campus that comes at questions at the nexus of technology and society from different angles,” Tavoulareas wrote to The Hoya. “Events like this allow us to spotlight that, and build connective tissue between the people and organizations who are immersed in these issues.” 
Hosting the event in-person was a good way to bring people together on this topic, Tavoulareas said. 
“Tech and Society launched right before the pandemic, so it’s really wonderful to see this all surfacing in such an engaging way across the campus. In many ways it is a physical manifestation of the work happening across tech and society, and we hope this is just the beginning,” Tavoulareas wrote. 
The Georgetown Tech Policy Initiative (GTPI), a student-led group at the McCourt School of Public Policy, was also involved with this year’s Tech Week. GTPI engages in policy discussions on the future uses of technology and connects students with leaders in government, academia and civil society. 
GTPI President Jordan Miller said that the high turnout for events throughout the week demonstrates growing demand for discussions about technology policy. 
“We hope that students will absorb both the gravity of this moment in history, including what is at stake if we do not course correct from technology that thrives on partisanship and outrage, but also the possibilities that are now within reach due to emerging innovation, as well as the need for further involvement by tomorrow’s policy leaders who can set rules of the road,” Miller wrote to The Hoya.  
Shelby Switzer, a Beeck Center Fellow who works on an intergovernmental collaborative software project, planned two events for this year’s Tech and Society Week. 
One of the events, a virtual panel called All Roads Lead to Procurement, examined how to apply new technologies across jurisdictions, Switzer said. 
“On Thursday, we’re having a virtual panel called ‘All Roads Lead to Procurement’ where we’re going to talk about the challenges facing city and state procurement thresholds and how we can help improve the way that government at the local and state level buys better tech,”  Switzer said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Faculty members are also involved during the week of events. Donald Moynihan, a professor in the McCourt School of Public Policy who studies how technology can enhance citizen-state interactions, spoke at an April 5 event titled “Is Tech A Dependence of Public Policy?” The event explored the role of technology responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Moynihan said establishing relationships between a variety of departments across the university is essential to enhance technology policy. 
“Georgetown has a great many faculty interested in the topic of how tech matters to society, in places like our public policy school, computer science department, and law school, as well as specialist centers like the Beeck Center,” Moynihan wrote to The Hoya. 
Switzer hopes students will walk away gaining something from Tech and Society week. 
“I personally am most looking forward to meeting more people across Georgetown and seeing the really cool work that I know is going on here and hopefully getting to connect with these folks. I hope that everyone else kind of gets the same out of it. It’s a great chance to connect with real work on the ground and talk with people doing that work,” Switzer wrote.

Four Georgetown undergraduate students have been named 2022 Goldwater Scholars in honor of their research in the natural sciences, mathematics and engineering.
The Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation, an agency that partners with the U.S. Department of Defense to recognize student achievements in scientific research, gave the awards, which consist of up to $7,500 to be used for tuition, fees, books, room and board for sophomores and juniors. 
This year’s Goldwater Scholars — Aryaman Arora (COL ’24), Adrian Kalaw (COL ’23), Dominic Pham (COL ’23) and Nadia Sadanandan (NHS ’24) — were selected from a pool of over 5,000 college sophomores and juniors. 
This year marks the first time since 2006 that more than one Georgetown student has been named a Goldwater Scholar in a given year, according to Lauren Tuckley, director of Georgetown’s Center for Research and Fellowships (CRF). The center supports Georgetown students in applying to competitive fellowships like the Fulbright Student Scholars Program.
Arora, who centered his research for the award on computer translations and the encoding of South Asian languages, said this work allowed him to connect to his heritage while also contributing to an often overlooked field.
“I really like this kind of research — it appeals to both my academic interests and is a way to engage with my culture,” Arora wrote to The Hoya. “At the end of the day I want things I work on to benefit people and be openly accessible, and research is a practical way of doing that.”
Sadanandan, whose research focuses on tumor biology in zebrafish, hopes to apply what she learns through research as a Goldwater Scholar to eventually become a pediatric oncologist.
“In high school, one of my best friend’s fathers passed away from cancer and that drove me to wanting to research this,” Sadanandan said in an interview with The Hoya. “Also, one of my favorite teachers from high school passed from cancer, which has led me to wanting to discover more and help find solutions for this.”
As a Goldwater Scholar, Pham is excited to continue to pursue and conduct research, which he became passionate about while at Georgetown.
“I entered Georgetown knowing I wanted to try scientific research, but I didn’t really know what it was,” Pham wrote. “My journey to getting involved in research was filled with a lot of luck—being in the right place at the right time and having research mentors who guided me from one step to the next.”
Pham previously served as Managing Editor and Creative Director at The Hoya.
Kalaw’s submission for the Goldwater scholarship applied computational methods to the examination of protein mutation in antimalarial drug resistance, which he said was an unconventional and unprecedented research strategy.
“I was in uncharted territories for our lab and our field applying novel methods at the boundary of what we do and do not know,” Kalaw wrote to The Hoya. “I had never felt more excited to be a scientist.”
Becoming a Goldwater Scholar is an honor for students who devoted time and effort to research that they are passionate about, according to Pham.
“The Goldwater Scholarship really validates my work thus far and my decision to pursue a research career,” Pham wrote to The Hoya. “I’m incredibly grateful to my academic mentors, family, and friends for their support and inspiration.”
The Goldwater Scholarship’s esteemed reputation in the science fields makes this an impressive accomplishment for the university, according to CRF’s Tuckley.
“The Goldwater is our nation’s most prestigious undergraduate STEM scholarship,” Tuckley wrote to The Hoya. “This achievement reflects both the high quality of our students’ engagement in rigorous research and the outstanding faculty mentorship that occurs at the university.”

Select Georgetown University students were chosen for the opportunity to work at venture capital or investment firms to complete tasks including due diligence, deal sourcing and assisting portfolio companies. 
The Georgetown Venture Fellows Program, a joint collaboration between the MBA Career Center at the McDonough School of Business (MSB) and Georgetown Entrepreneurship, welcomed four undergraduate and 13 graduate students to its eighth annual cohort. The Venture Fellows will work at one of 11 different firms part time during the spring and fall semesters and full time during the summer. 
Eric Young, managing director and assistant dean at the McDonough School MBA Career Center, said Venture Fellows learn crucial investing skills during their participation in the program. 
“Students gain exposure to the venture capital lifecycle, get involved with deal flow, financial modeling, due diligence, attending investor meetings, even taking part in company retreats. Sometimes they’ll work with portfolio companies,” Young wrote to The Hoya. “One of the greatest benefits is the networking students do and the relationships they build, within Georgetown and beyond.”
The Venture Fellows Program offers an entry point into the competitive venture capital industry, and applications for spots within the program were at a record high this cycle. The MBA Career Center coordinates with regional and national companies, while aspiring Venture Fellows submit applications and complete one to five interviews at firms, where they often receive job offers in the venture capital industry after graduation.
Jeff Reid, director of Georgetown Entrepreneurship, said that firms were previously unsatisfied with traditional interns, which created demand for longer programs like the Georgetown Venture Fellows Program. 
“If the internship is just a few hours a week during the school year, it’s difficult for the student to get into the flow of the workweek,” Reid wrote to The Hoya. “And if it’s just a few weeks during the summer, the VCs told me that by the time the student learned enough, the summer was over. Thus, our Fellows Program runs from January through at least August, and sometimes an entire 12-month cycle. By the time the Fellowship is finishing, many firms tell me the Fellows were so valuable they can’t wait to get the next one.”
Taylor Deasy (MSB ’24), a Venture Fellow interning with Qodeo, a startup that matches venture capital and private equity firms with entrepreneurs, said that the Venture Fellows Program has already opened up doors to the industry of venture capital. 
“It has been an amazing experience so far,” Deasy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The ability to work so closely with the management team and have a visible impact on the company has been super cool. I am flying out to Boston for a VC event tomorrow, which should be an amazing experience as well. The fellowship has exceeded my expectations and I look forward to moving along with the process.”
Jacob Berns (GRD ’23), a Venture Fellow working with StepStone Group, a private markets firm which leads a group for venture investing, said the work he does aligns with his interests.
“I’m a Team Lead in the InSITE Fellows program, which is a program that matches local startups with teams of MBA students to help in a consulting-style capacity,” Berns wrote to The Hoya. “I come from a consulting background and really enjoy working with startups, given my interest in venture capital, so this program was also a great fit for me.”
Berns said the program’s network effect benefits both individual students and the larger Georgetown reputation. 
“The Venture Fellow program provides a great community for both graduate and undergraduate students interested in venture capital to connect,” Berns wrote. “The more and more interest and participation we get into the program, the more recognition and awareness Georgetown will get in the national venture capital conversation.”

A Georgetown University professor wrote a book entitled “The Other ‘68ers: Student Protest and Christian Democracy in West Germany,” which focuses on center-right student activists in West Germany in 1968.
The book, written by history professor Anna von der Goltz, was released last June. On March 30 a reception was held to launch the book, which was published by Oxford University Press. Through oral interviews and archives, the book explores the effects of the protests in the 1960s on German student activists across the political spectrum, specifically focusing on the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.  
Christian Democrats are often left out of post-World War II German history, von der Goltz said, despite the large role they played in German history. 
“It really started with a question: What about them? What did they make of student protest, of cultural upheaval — everything that is certainly associated with the 1960s,” von der Goltz said in an interview with The Hoya. “I just started looking into it a little bit, and then was quite struck by how much I found and their presence in a lot of key protest events.” 
The CDU party is a center-right German political party that supports a free-market economy and social programs, but holds conservative social views. The party was founded in 1945 by Catholic activists, liberal and conservative Protestants and members of the middle class who wished to prevent the rebirth of facism in Germany after WWII. 
The CDU believed that a federal republic would best protect against a resurgence of facism in Germany and that the far left was a new embodiment of facism, according to von der Goltz. 
Georgetown History Department Chair Bryan McCann said von der Goltz’s book provides a perspective about German youth that is not typically told. 
“Von der Goltz’s book overturns previous understandings of young leftists challenging a staid establishment. She demonstrates that Christian Democratic students participated in a project of challenging an older generation in their own way,” McCann wrote to The Hoya. 
The use of oral history and von der Goltz’s interviews with veterans from political campaigns mentioned in the book added more depth to the storytelling of the book, according to McCann. 
Von der Goltz said her research highlights the tension that existed between generations during this period of German history.  
“There’s this famous quote that also made it into West Germany about how you don’t trust anyone over 30,” von der Goltz said. “That is sometimes taken to mean that really, the main conflict here is an age-related one with young people versus old people, and what I share is really that it’s also young people against each other. I think that has larger repercussions for how we think about the role of generations in history.”
Ideological division, as shown in the book, remains a relevant topic today, von de Goltz said.  
“The ’60s and ’70s in West Germany were an era of intense polarization,” von der Goltz said. “There are many echoes obviously between the American ’60s and the present here, but also between what was going on then.”
Von de Goltz has taught an undergraduate proseminar course focused on divisions within Germany entitled “Europe’s 1968.” She plans to teach this course in fall 2022 as well. 
Professor Aviel Roshwald said the book was an original take on the experiences of the 1960 generation in West Germany by focusing on political activity .
“She shows how the era around 1968 proved a rite of passage for them as well, but as part of a distinctive political and cultural trajectory that was to have a lasting impact on the substance and style of the Christian Democratic party in decades to come.” Roshwald wrote to The Hoya. 
Studying this era of German history can inform current political circumstances, especially given polarization, according to von der Goltz.
“I think studying this period can sharpen the analysis of the present. I think in some ways, maybe it shows us that there were other outcomes possible,” von der Goltz said. “What we’re experiencing here now isn’t the only way the story could have unfolded.”

Georgetown’s first all-women team will compete in a global business venture capital competition final against 19 teams from around the globe.  
Georgetown’s Team Elm will compete April 8 and 9 at the Venture Capital Investment Competition (VCIV), an event based on venture capital startup pitch analysis, due diligence and written deliverables. The event is hosted by the University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School. 
Team Elm won the Mid-Atlantic regional competition in February against teams from American University, Elon University, Emory University and the University of North Carolina, where they competed to present the best hypothetical investment before a panel of judges. 
Teams are judged on the quality of their diligence sessions, term sheets and partner meetings.
The team is composed of five undergraduate women: Erin Connery (MSB ’24), Kate Gilles (MSB ’23), Betsy Ratliffe (SFS ’23), Tian Shi (COL ’22) and Sydney Yin (SFS ’22). Former championship winner Sara Zulkosky (GRD ’14), a Georgetown entrepreneur advisor, is their coach.
Gilles said it was inspiring to be a part of an entirely female team in what is traditionally a male-dominated field. 
“It’s been exciting to see that people are inspired by an all-female team. At our regional competition, one of the judges remarked that he felt inspired when he saw our team competing,” Gilles wrote to The Hoya. “He has daughters and hopes that they feel empowered enough to also enter male-dominated spaces as we have.” 
Only 4.9% of venture capitalists in the United States are women. White women disproportionately make up this already small figure, with only 0.2 % of Latinx and 0.2% of Black women representing venture capitalists. Furthermore, female founders in the United States secured only 2% of venture capital funding in 2021.
At VCIC, teams must conduct independent research, craft diligence questions and term sheets, participate in diligence sessions with entrepreneurs and have partner meetings with the judges. In venture capitalism, due diligence refers to investigating an investment opportunity before committing funding. 
The team was commended by judges for their ability to engage with entrepreneurs, something they were told male-majority teams lacked, according to Shi. 
“During the feedback sessions from our regional competition, one of the judges said that the main difference between our all-female team and male-dominated teams is that we are more cognizant of how to interact with the entrepreneur and better at establishing rapport,” Shi wrote to The Hoya. 
Georgetown Entrepreneurship Founding Director Jeff Reid said it is symbolic that an all-women team made it to the final of the competition.  
“The fact that they are all women is important in a symbolic sense, but nobody should forget that they are also extremely talented and each one of them has demonstrated a strong understanding of venture capital,” Reid wrote to The Hoya. “This is not a gimmick; they are very good at what they do. And they want to win.” 
Georgetown Entrepreneurship, a program that fosters an entrepreneurial environment across campus to make an impact on the world, is committed to diversity, Reid wrote. 
“Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core values for Georgetown Entrepreneurship, so I am happy that this team can bring some attention to how the Venture Capital industry is trying to change,” Reid wrote. 
Applications for the team opened this past fall to all undergraduate students, where students outlined their interest in venture capital, relevant skills and experience, according to Reid. Teams are then formed based on this information, he said. 
Although the final competition will take place April 9, Ratliffe said she is confident that the team will continue to support one another in the future. 
“Although the competition ends this weekend at Global Finals, I feel confident that our team will continue to support each other long after the competition is over,” Ratliffe wrote to The Hoya. “We are very lucky to have spent a significant amount of time with each other over the last few months and we have gotten quite close.”
Ratliffe looks forward to seeing what her fellow teammates accomplish in the future at Georgetown and in venture capitalism.  
“As five women all interested in the venture capital space, a notoriously male-dominated business sector,” Ratliffe wrote. “We are extremely supportive of each other’s goals. I know this support will continue moving forward, and I am personally excited to see all of the amazing work my teammates do long after their time at Georgetown.”

The United States political system has become increasingly polarized and requires bipartisan collaboration to best serve U.S. citizens, Representative Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said at an event. 
At the April 5 event, “How to Heal: Pushing Through Polarization,” Kinzinger spoke about how fear worsens political polarization and his hope for future generations’ ability to resolve it. 
The event was hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service (GU Politics), the Georgetown College Republicans and the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition. This event is the first in GU Politics’ new forum series titled “How to Heal: A Series on Pushing Through Polarization,” aiming to bring together political leaders and activists across the political spectrum to discuss the issue of polarization.
Kinzinger said fearmongering has become an increasingly popular tactic used by politicians, which has contributed to the polarization within the U.S. political sphere. 
“Members of Congress raise a ton of cash on fear,” Kinzinger said at the event. “If I tell you that I am the one that’s going to protect either Nancy Pelosi or Mitch McConnell from killing your family — it’s almost that bad — in fundraising, you will part with anything, including your money, to prevent that from happening.” 
Kinzinger is one of two Republican lawmakers on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. He was also one of 10 House Republicans to vote for the impeachment of former President Donald Trump following the insurrection. 
Political polarization among Americans has grown rapidly in the last 40 years — faster than the rise of polarization in European and other prominent democracies, according to a January 2020 National Bureau of Economic Research working paper.
Centering humanity can provide a solution for polarization, according to Kinzinger.
“For the most part, in a political setting, people are scared that this country is not going to accept them or leave them behind,” Kinzinger said. “When both people who have very different views recognize and look in each other’s eyes and say ‘your fear is the exact same as mine,’ that disarms everybody and you begin to see things sympathetically.” 
Kinzinger said a key part of easing polarization is not for people to abandon their beliefs, but to learn how to coexist. 
“It’s important for us to put that message out there to folks and just say ‘demand better.’ When we talk about compromise and common ground, I’m not talking about somebody giving up what they believe and going and becoming moderate or squish or not arguing. Like, keep that, but recognize you live in a society with people that are different than you,” Kinzinger said.
It is up to younger generations to foster bipartisanship within U.S. politics, according to Kinzinger.
“There are too many kinds of old people in politics that are still fighting the same battles they’ve always fought, you know? They’re arguing the same stuff they were arguing in the sixties, right? Same solutions to the same problems. You guys will be the ones that are going to have to fix problems and also change how we deal with each other,” Kinzinger said.
A disproportionate number of American lawmakers represent older generations, with baby boomers making up 53% of the House of Representatives and 68% of the Senate, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center report. Furthermore, the Silent Generation makes up 38 members of congress. There is only one millennial member of the Senate and there are 31 millennial members of the House. 
Kinzinger said future generations are capable of taking action against the polarization plaguing U.S. politics. 
“Your guys’ generation, I’ve got to tell you, is so interested and engaged in this stuff, and they’re so fed up that we’re not going to see a generation of people that are fed up and say, ‘we’re just not going to pay attention,’” Kinzinger said. “You all are fed up and you’re going to be spurred to action.”

Sajaka Shelton: Thanks for this article. It shines light on yet another under represented group within our government. Openly describing &  analyzing differnces in any facit of life can be a catalyst for needful change. These opportunities lead to fair representation for any person(s) on U.S. soil. Starting with the superficial (visually seen), analyzing the cause, then implementing an approprately fair solution (run for congressional seat) will yield unarguable result.s.

Over 40 horses at Meadowbrook Stables, the facility that Georgetown’s Club Equestrian Team uses, have contracted Equine Herpes Virus (EHV-1). One horse has died from the illness. 
The facility, located in Chevy Chase, Md., is monitoring the horses’ symptoms and will remain closed through at least late April. Since Meadowbrook Stables closed March 10, Georgetown’s Club Equestrian Team has been unable to practice at the facility. 
Equestrian Club co-captain Hunter Spillan (SFS ’22) said the club is currently unable to practice because the facility has to restart a 28-day quarantine cycle every time a new horse tests positive for EHV-1.
“It’s a full quarantine — horses are not being used at all right now,” Spillan told The Hoya. “It’s pretty tough because it’s my last season, and basically we’re suspended for the time being.”
EHV-1 typically causes respiratory symptoms like nasal discharge and coughing, but dozens of the horses at Meadowbrook Stables have also shown unusual neurological symptoms, Meadowbrook’s Executive Director Katrina Weinig said.
“The virus can mutate when it’s spread, and there are certain strains that can become neurologic and cause neurological symptoms, such as stumbling and disorientation,” Weinig said. “We’ve never had neurologic symptoms before.”
River, a pony at Meadowbrook Stables, was euthanized March 10 after demonstrating neurological symptoms. Later tests showed that River had EHV-1, according to a Facebook post March 18.
In an effort to mitigate the spread of EHV-1, Meadowbrook Stables quarantined their horses in 24 temporary stalls, while staff members and volunteers continue to take the horses’ temperatures, perform neurological exams and give medications multiple times per day, according to a Meadowbrook email obtained by The Hoya. 
Meadowbrook Stables set up a GoFundMe fundraiser March 21 to raise donations to support the barn while it is closed and help pay for the horses’ treatment. As of April 7, the online fundraiser has reached $32,875 of its $85,000 goal.
The EHV-1 outbreak will ultimately cost Meadowbrook Stables about $150,000, according to a Meadowbrook email obtained by The Hoya. Refunding all riders for canceled lessons would cost the barn around $180,000, which could impact the facility’s ability to continue operations, the email said. As a result, the barn will not be refunding riders. 
Rather than offer refunds, Meadowbrook Stables’ riders can either opt for a partial credit to be used for future lessons after the horses recover or make a charitable donation equal to the amount of their canceled lessons, according to the email. 
Although EHV-1 is common in horses, with most contracting the virus before the age of two, this is the first time horses at Meadowbrook Stables have become sick with EHV-1, according to Weinig.
“We’ve had a potential exposure before and we implemented biosecurity protocols to make sure there were no sick horses and no transmission, but we had no positive cases that time,” Weinig told The Hoya. 
Sofia Houts (COL ’25), a member of Georgetown’s equestrian team from California, said this is the first time she knows that horses she rides have been infected. 
“The virus has been prevalent for over a year and it shut down a lot of shows in California in the fall,” Houts told The Hoya. “In the past it’s been spread at shows, so if we’ve had horses at our barn who were at a show that the virus was at, we would quarantine them in a separate space, but it never infected my barn.”
Weinig said that most of the horses are recovering well, but Meadowbrook will allow the horses to build up their fitness level after weeks of sickness before resuming the typical lesson program. 
The equestrian team hopes that the horses recover quickly and that the team can resume practice soon, Spillan said. 
“It’s like losing a pet or a teammate. For some of them it’s fatal, which is really upsetting and scary,” Spillan said. “As a team, we’re really rooting for them and hoping for the best, and thankfully it seems like they’re getting it under control.”

As she left the U.S. Capitol building on the afternoon of April 5, POLITICO Reporter Ximena Bustillo felt a nip at the back of her foot. When she turned around, she expected to see a squirrel or a rat. Instead, Bustillo came face-to-face with a fox that had sunk its teeth into her ankle. 
Bustillo was one of at least nine people attacked by the rabid fox that incited chaos at the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., before Capitol Police and the Humane Rescue Alliance captured the creature April 5. The fox was euthanized April 6, and D.C. Health confirmed the animal to be positive for rabies that same day.
The attack came as a surprise to Bustillo, who was walking in the grass on the northern Senate side of the Capitol building.
“I was walking and it bit me from behind so I didn’t even see it,” Bustillo wrote to The Hoya. “It wasn’t like I was trying to feed or pet it.”  
Bustillo went to the emergency department to receive rabies and tetanus shots, despite her injury being minor. She said many people reached out to check in on her after she tweeted about the fox attack. 
According to D.C. Health, the fox’s three kits were later discovered in the fox family’s den, but had to be euthanized April 7 because of their exposure to rabies from the mother fox. 
Elisabeth Wachtel (SFS ’24), who works as an intern at the U.S. Senate, was leaving her office Monday evening when she saw a flash of orange fur in front of her.
“I was really confused, because I did not expect that at all,” Wachtel told The Hoya. “Even when you see a dog that’s loose, it’s a little concerning, so to see a fox is just crazy. Also, because the Capitol isn’t near a park, I don’t know how a fox would even get to the Capitol.”
Full disclosure: Wachtel is a news writer at The Hoya. 
The District is home to many animals that have become accustomed to city life, including foxes, and this particular fox was seen around the Capitol grounds in the days leading up to the attack. 
Wachtel heard screams, and ran toward the Metro as quickly as possible to avoid becoming the rabid fox’s next victim.
Wachtel was scared to return to her internship Wednesday after reading about the fox on the news.
“I didn’t go outside for lunch, which I normally do, because I just wanted to stay in the building and I didn’t want to leave unnecessarily,” Wachtel said. 
The fox also attacked Congressman Ami Bera (D-Calif.) the evening of April 4, biting into his pant leg. Despite not sustaining a direct injury, Bera visited a physician and received a set of shots out of an abundance of caution.
D.C. Health will be contacting everyone the fox bit and encouraged anyone who came into physical contact with the fox or its kits to reach out to D.C. Health.
“The DC Public Health lab has confirmed the fox that was captured yesterday tested positive for the rabies virus,” D.C. Health wrote to The Hoya. “DC Health is contacting all human victims who were bitten by the fox. Animal control will post informational flyers around Capitol Hill advising of the fox’s positive rabies status and encouraging people who might have been exposed to call DC Health.”
Foxes are one of the most likely carriers of rabies in the region, and the most common way for humans to contract rabies is through a rabid animal bite. The best way to prevent serious illness or death from rabies is to receive a series of rabies vaccinations — five shots over the course of 14 days — soon after being bitten. Rabies has a mortality rate of 99.9% for those who do not obtain treatment.
Even though the fox tested positive for rabies, District officials have no plans to round up other foxes in the area or to remove wildlife unless rabies testing is warranted by human exposure, according to D.C. Health.
News of the fox attacks quickly circulated on social media, causing a frenzy across the District. A Twitter account was even created for the fox — with the handle @thecapitolfox — and posted a statement from the fox’s perspective satirically denying biting any individuals.
“Today, I was forcibly removed from my den by very scary and mean individuals,” the tweet reads. “I am innocent of the crimes in question. This will not be the end.”
Despite the fear that came along with encountering the fox first-hand, Wachtel said she felt like a celebrity after seeing the fox that became internet famous.
“I almost thought it was a fever dream that I had made up,” Wachtel said. “I do feel like I really saw the current politics.”

Following two years of modified schedules due to the COVID-19 pandemic and staffing shortages, most of the Smithsonian museums will return to a seven-day schedule by the end of May.
The Smithsonian announced a return to a traditional schedule for most of its facilities March 29, with gradual scheduling changes until May 30, when pre-pandemic schedules will return for all but two of the Smithsonian museums. The National Air and Space Museum will remain closed for renovations, and the Arts and Industries Building will remain on a reduced schedule until the end of July.
Alexandria Fairchild, a Smithsonian spokesperson, said the gradual opening will enable the Smithsonian museums to prepare for the challenges related to staffing and security of returning to pre-pandemic operations.
“Opening Smithsonian museums and the Zoo for additional days is a complex process and requires support from departments and resources that are shared by all Smithsonian museums,” Fairchild wrote to The Hoya. “We are increasing days of operation on a gradual basis so we don’t overwhelm these offices and can offer full support to each museum and the Zoo.”
Samantha Yi (SFS ’22), who frequently visits Smithsonian museums in her free time, said the return to a seven-day schedule will make the Smithsonian museums more accessible for students or employees with busy schedules.
“Many people in the workforce are often only free during the weekends, so going back to the traditional schedule will allow more people to visit the museums and attend events that were not possible during the height of COVID-19,” Yi wrote to The Hoya. 
The museums that are temporarily closed will take longer to reopen, whereas the museums that are now on a modified schedule will be easier to open, according to Fairchild.
“There is no specific answer why each museum or the Zoo is returning to seven days a week on a specific date, it depends on many factors like staffing, exhibition changes, and the specific needs of each museum,” Fairchild wrote. “For example, it’s easier for museums that have been open five or more days a week (like the American History and African American museums) to return to seven days, than it is for museums that were temporarily closed until March (like the Anacostia Community Museum), so those museums are earlier on the list.”
The Smithsonian Institution Building, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, the National Zoo and the National Museum of Natural History have already been operating on a seven-day schedule.
While the Smithsonian schedule will soon mimic pre-pandemic operations for the first time since March 2020, staff will continue to monitor COVID-19 trends and take steps to reduce operations or close locations entirely.
Visitors to Smithsonian museums have not been required to wear a mask since March 11, and no longer need to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination. 
Despite the removal of COVID-19 safety protocols required of visitors, the Smithsonian is committed to creating an environment in which visitors feel safe, according to Fairchild.
“Any visitor who prefers to wear a mask during their visit is encouraged to do so. Our museums get very crowded in the Spring and Summer so we cannot always enforce social distancing, but continue to encourage it when possible as good practice,” Fairchild wrote. 
Still, Yi expressed concerns about the lack of safety protocols, especially when large numbers of tourists are all in the same buildings. 
“When it comes to more popular museums, it tends to be crowded with a lot of children as well, which is not an ideal environment to be in when the majority is maskless and the status of vaccination is unclear,” Yi wrote. “This is especially concerning in areas such as the cafeterias within museums where people congregate.”
Staff at the various Smithsonian museums have been trying to reopen since the pandemic forced closures, according to Fairchild.
“Prior to March 2020, Smithsonian museums and the Zoo operated on seven day a week schedules,” Fairchild wrote. “It has always been our goal to return to that schedule, and several factors made that possible this spring including guidance from the CDC and local and national guidelines around COVID-19.”
