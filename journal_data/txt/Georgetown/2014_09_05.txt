A dozen Syrian women scheduled to perform the play “Syria: Trojan Women” on campus later this month will no longer be coming to Georgetown, after the U.S. government denied their visa applications.
The women, who are currently living as refugees in Amman, Jordan, are not permitted to enter the United States because of uncertainty about whether they will leave.
“These women so clearly have been through so much and have such a powerful story to tell. They have a chance to be one of the very few and rare humanizing voices we hear out of the Syrian conflict,” Davis Center for Performing Arts Artistic Director Derek Goldman, co-founding director of the Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics, said. “It seems absurd that in 2014 there shouldn’t be a way to move such an extraordinary and well-documented project from one free country to another with some sense of protection and support for the work they’ve done to tell their story.”
The production reworks Euripides’s “Trojan Women” to include the stories of the refugees. The event at Georgetown was scheduled to be the group’s first performance outside of the Middle East. The performance at Georgetown was supposed to launch Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics’s Myriad Voices: A Cross Cultural Performance Festival, a two-year program series that will focus on generating a deeper understanding of Muslim communities around the world. The Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics is a joint initiative between the School of Foreign Service and the Theater and Performance Studies Program.
“We really wanted to have the chance to give the women the platform to tell their stories and to tell them through this incredible production,” Ambassador Cynthia Schneider, the other co-founding director for the Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics, said. “This play that was written 2,500 years ago about the devastating impact of war, particularly on women suffering the impact of defeat, resonates so strongly with a situation today.”
The State Department’s decision came after months of communication with the Jordanian embassy and top-ranking consulate officers in the State Department on behalf of the 12 women.
“We had been working for about nine months, very steadily and on a daily basis on the visas for these women. We were fortunate to be able to hire a top immigration attorney,” Schneider said. “We have left no stone unturned.”
Evidence such as documentation proving that the women have young children in Jordan and will leave the United States to act in scheduled performances around the world did not prove sufficient in convincing the State Department that the refugees do not plan to stay in the United States, Goldman said.
The group is scheduled to perform in Switzerland in November, and the Swiss government has already approved their visas.
“We hope that if we do go to Switzerland and return from Switzerland, that will be an added piece of information in their favor and we could then potentially reapply with that piece of information,” Schneider said.
In lieu of the play, the festival will commence Sept. 19 with a summit about “Syria: Trojan Women.” The summit will include video footage from the production, a conversation with the show’s artistic team and producers and a forum with policy experts who will talk about the situation in Syria. There will also be a live video chat with the group of women in Amman.
“The summit is basically a solidarity event and an awareness and advocacy event in a moment for the community to come together around this project and hear from the women,” Goldman said.
Additionally, Goldman said that he hopes that the summit will garner attention about the visa denial.
“There’s been a lot of impassioned response in reaction to this news from everyone from government officials to the press,” Goldman said. “I think awareness is the first step. People are feeling outraged that they missed something.”
Schneider and Goldman will continue to work with the State Department and the Jordanian embassy to bring the women to the United States. They are calling the cancellation of this month’s scheduled performance an “indefinite postponement.”
“We certainly hold out hope that the project has a future life in person in the United States and indeed at Georgetown, but we also are realistic about … how difficult the challenges of getting that to change are going to be,” Goldman said. “We believe there could be a way, but it’s going to take some imagination and some open-mindedness and open-heartedness on the part of a range of people including state department officials to really see the reality of the situation.”
Amin Gharad (COL ’16) said that he was disappointed to hear that the refugees will not be coming to campus this month. Gharad, along with 13 other Georgetown students, met four of the 12 Syrian women in the production last month during the Office of Global Education’s Summer in Amman program.
“Spending an evening in Amman with these inspiring women and hearing their stories, in their voices, on their terms, brought the Syrian crisis to life in a painfully real, but necessary, way,” Gharad wrote in an email. “Their visit would’ve gifted us with true voices from a conflict that are often lost in the sea of figures and detached reports. It’s shameful that realpolitik and selfishness could be allowed to stonewall such an opportunity and bring further difficulty to individuals who have already suffered so much.”

Following in the footsteps of Georgetown men’s basketball greats Patrick Ewing (CAS ’85) and Jeff Green (COL ’12), All-American Roy Hibbert (COL ’08) made a donation toward the construction of the John R. Thompson Jr. Intercollegiate Athletics Center, prompting fan-favorite CasualHoya to launch a giving campaign of its own.
The Indiana Pacers center’s $1 million gift came on Sept.  2, on the occasion of Thompson Jr.’s 73rd birthday.
The Thompson Athletic Center has gained a total of $5.3 million from these three donations in the past 11 days alone.
Hibbert credited Thompson Jr.’s son, current Head Coach John Thompson III, for his development as a player and a man during his time on the Hilltop.
“I am deeply indebted to Georgetown University and the basketball program for all they have done for me,” Hibbert said in a statement. “I put in a lot of hard work to get where I am, but I was given a tremendous amount of guidance both on and off the floor from Coach Thompson III and I wouldn’t be here without him.”
A member of Georgetown’s back-to-back Big East regular-season championship teams spanning 2006 to 2008, Hibbert brought the university closer to its $62 million overall funding goal with his donation.
Thompson III returned Hibbert’s gratitude with kind words of his own for his former player.
“This gift is significant but it is only one of the ways that [Hibbert] supports those who are coming behind him at Georgetown,” Thompson III said in a statement. “He has consistently shown that he is a man of actions, not merely words.”
The construction of the center will commence Sept. 12 with a groundbreaking ceremony. Highly touted Class of 2015 recruits Dwayne Bacon and Bryant Crawford will make their official visits to Georgetown on that day, making it a crucial day for Georgetown varsity athletics, and men’s basketball in particular.
In the midst of this flurry of donations, CasualHoya.com founder Andrew Geiger (COL ’99) has launched The Casual Campaign to aid what he considers a vital fundraising process.
“I believe the timely completion of the Thompson Center is the single most important venture for the future success and sustainability of the Georgetown basketball program,” Geiger wrote in an email. “In this new era of conference realignment and with Georgetown entering its second season in a very different-looking Big East, the school needs a facility like the [Thompson Athletic Center] in order to remain competitive with other programs both in and outside of the conference that are competing for the same top recruits.”
As the founder of the popular Georgetown men’s basketball blog, Geiger has engendered a significant response from the Georgetown community through his campaign.
“Since CasualHoya.com is the biggest site on the Internet for Georgetown basketball fans, I felt compelled to do what I could in order to help the cause,” Geiger wrote. “The response to The Casual Campaign has been overwhelmingly positive, and the timing of the initiative in concert with the donations from Ewing/Falk, Jeff Green and Roy Hibbert was perfect as there is an energy among Hoyas basketball fans right now about the project and a desire to make sure it gets completed on time.”
With the looming 2014-2015 basketball season, the importance of Hibbert’s gift and the Thompson Athletic Center project as a whole comes into clearer focus. The Thompson Athletic Center will house the new Georgetown Athletics Hall of Fame and men’s and women’s basketball coaches’ offices. The four-story, 144,000-square foot structure will be built adjacent to McDonough Arena, and will contain weight-training, sports medicine, team meeting and practice facilities for all varsity programs.

The Georgetown University Student Association and its Transfer Council launched a mentorship program for incoming transfer students this semester. In June, 100 transfer students were assigned to 40 peer mentors who helped answer questions and ease each transfer student’s transition into life at Georgetown.
Although all incoming transfer students have an orientation adviser during New Student Orientation, and transfer students in the College, the School of Nursing and Health Studies and the McDonough School of Business have academic peer advisors, GUSA’s peer mentorship program is a unique resource.
GUSA’s Secretary of Transfer Affairs, Sara Margolis (COL ’16) said that she feels that transfer students enter college on a different plane than freshmen, making the transition more difficult in some ways.
“While freshmen don’t really know what the deal is with college, everyone kind of comes in in the same place. They’ve never been to college before and they have kind of leveled expectations,” Margolis said. “When transfers get to campus, they’ve come from different kinds of schools. … Everyone has a different story when they come to Georgetown, but I think that’s especially so with transfers. I felt that there was this void for a resource to introduce transfers to campus and campus life.”
According to GUSA Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15), the program will help give transfers access to more long-term support.
“We definitely saw in talking to transfers last year that often, transfers are not thought of as a first priority when they come to Georgetown, which can really be detrimental to their experience and their transition,” Jikaria said. “We thought that GUSA was a great place where we could create a transfer council that advocates for transfer specific issues.”
Over 40 students applied to become peer mentors for incoming transfer students. These mentors, all transfer students themselves, contacted their mentees during the summer and answered their questions about Georgetown.
“There are a lot of great services for freshmen that come to Georgetown, but often transfers aren’t thought of in that process. The mentorship program kind of is an offshoot of that. It’s a great way to pair up transfers with transfers that are already at Georgetown,” Jikaria said. “It’s definitely important to have that kind of connection and it’s great to be connected to a transfer at Georgetown because a lot of the transfer orientation advisers aren’t transfers themselves, so we thought this was a great way to create that community.”
Kristen Fedor (COL ’17), an incoming transfer student, said that the added resource of a peer mentor has helped her transition into campus life.
“It’s hard going in as a sophomore,” Fedor said. “You don’t want your hand to be held like freshmen’s are, but we still have a lot of questions. It’s nice that they take an extra step for that.”
Although Fedor has not corresponded with her peer mentor frequently, she said that it is reassuring to know that a resource is always available to her.
“I didn’t end up asking [my mentor] that many in-depth questions, but it was definitely nice to know that there were people on campus who were there to help if I did have any questions and to have as a resource especially going through things like preregistration for the first time, or just knowing that if I needed help with the transition, that there was someone there who I had as a resource,” Fedor said.
Margolis said she hopes that this program will be part of a bigger process to make Georgetown more transfer friendly over the next few years.
“I’m hoping that it’s … raising the transfer experience at Georgetown,” Margolis said.“Transferring is never going to be easy. I would never go back and do it any other way, but it’s not easy to transfer schools. I’m hoping that gradually this gets picked up and someone keeps doing it year after year and it becomes the best school in the country to transfer to.”

D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson (SFS ’92, GRD ’07) has been appointed to Georgetown University’s board of directors. She will serve a three-year term beginning in October.
“We are proud to have Kaya Henderson serve on Georgetown’s Board of Directors. We admire and appreciate her contributions to our community, to the District of Columbia and to the education of young people here in our city, and across the country, and around the globe,” University President John J. DeGioia said in a statement to The Hoya. “By focusing on purpose, passion, empowerment, excellence — and most importantly — the success of the young people she serves, Kaya inspires those around her to promote one, fundamental idea: that nothing but the very best will do.”
After graduating from the School of Foreign Service, Henderson joined Teach for America, where she taught middle school Spanish in the Bronx. She went on to serve as national director of admissions for TFA, and eventually as executive director of TFA’s Washington, D.C. branch.
While pursuing her executive master’s degree in leadership at Georgetown, Henderson also worked as vice president for strategic partnerships with The New Teachers Project, a national nonprofit aiming to improve equality of education.
She became the interim chancellor of DCPS in November 2010, and was officially appointed chancellor in June 2011. Named one of the “World’s 7 Most Powerful Educators” by Forbes magazine in 2011, Henderson also received an honorable doctorate from Georgetown in April 2012. In fall 2012, she taught “Education Policy: Teachers” at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute.
“My many experiences as part of the Georgetown family have afforded me some truly incredible opportunities, including the surreal and touching moment when I was presented with an honorary doctorate,” Henderson said in a statement to The Hoya. “I firmly believe Georgetown is the best university in the world and has helped to shape who I am as a person and as a professional.”
In response to an inquiry by Henderson, D.C. Director of Government Ethics Darrin P. Sobin affirmed her ability to serve both on Georgetown’s board while continuing her position as DCPS Chancellor.
“Here, your service on the board would be part time, and I otherwise find nothing to suggest that that service would conflict significantly with the performance of your duties or impair the efficient operation of DCPS,” Sobin wrote in a letter posted on the D.C. Board of Ethics and Government Accountability’s website.
In his letter, he stressed that she will be barred from receiving any kind of gift or payment for her service to Georgetown while she is serving as DCPS chancellor. Additionally, she will be ethically obligated to recuse herself from any issues that could create a conflict of interest. Georgetown has two contracts with DCPS: one that permits DCPS principles to earn master’s degrees and another that gives law students the opportunity to teach pre-law classes to high school students. Henderson will recuse herself from participating in any matters related to these contracts or to any issues that involve both Georgetown and DCPS.
Henderson said she was honored to be chosen for this position at her alma mater.
“I am honored to have the opportunity to lend my knowledge and expertise to help the university continue to meet the Jesuit ideal of developing men and women for others,” she said.

The Metropolitan Police Department reported a significant increase in reported rapes last year, coinciding with the department changing its definition of rape to match FBI-Uniform Crime Reporting’s definition in January 2013.
MPD’s previous definition of rape was “the carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will,” which was updated for the first time since 1927 to be more inclusive and clear by defining rape as “penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.”
“The new definition better reflects the actual incidence of rape nationally,” Gwendolyn Crump, director of MPD’s Office of Communications, wrote in an email.
Reported rapes in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area increased by 67 percent to 393 incidents in 2013. According to Crump, 27 percent of these rapes fell under the new definition.
“Obviously the definition had a huge impact since it encapsulates what sexual assault is, and that is definitely is going to be increasing the number of reports,” Sexual Assault Peer Educator Chandini Jha (COL ’16) said. “I think the new definition is much better in terms of people understanding that rape isn’t just intercourse, but can be with other body parts.”
Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network Founder and President Scott Berkowitz pointed out that the new FBI definition was changed to better categorize crimes.
“The Metropolitan Police Department did not change what was to be considered a crime, but simply the rules about how the police department reports these crimes to the FBI,” Berkowitz said.
Although the change in definition did correlate with the jump in reports of sexual assault, Women’s Center Director Laura Kovach said that the change in legal definition would not necessarily affect the way that victims interpret and report rape, but rather it would affect the legal procedure that ensues after an assault is reported.
“Survivors will use words like ‘abuse,’ ‘sexual assault’ and ‘rape’ based on their experiences and not by legal definition,” Kovach wrote in an email.
Instead, several student activists and non-profit organizations working on the issue credited the rise in reports to an increase in both services and awareness on a national scale.
“An increase in reports is not usually correlated with an increase in assaults, but the increase in survivors being aware of services and being comfortable using those services. So the increase in reports could be an indicator that things are going well and survivors are being helped,” Take Back the Night President Sarah Rabon (COL ’16) said.
Campus Project Coordinator Elizabeth Krauss from the city’s Office of Victim Services commented on the sudden growth in services for survivors and loved ones in the D.C. area.
“In the past two years, those services have become much more visible,” Krauss wrote in an email. “With the U-ASK DC, University Assault Services Knowledge, phone application and website launched in September of 2012, and the ASK DC phone application and website launched in September of 2013, more and more people have been made aware of the excellent services the District has to offer.”
The recent passage of the Sexual Assault Victims’ Rights Amendment Act in May 2014 also guarantees that survivors will have the right to have an advocate present during police interviews and hospital exams.
“[SAVRAA] allows certain rights for survivors to feel comfortable and empowered to share their stories,” Jha said. “It confers confidentiality onto advocates and you can communicate with advocates without fear of being subpoenaed.”
Despite the great increase in reports in 2013, according to RAINN, 60 percent of sexual assaults nationally are not reported to the police and only about 3 percent of rapists will serve time in prison. These figures could be credited to discomfort that survivors feel when reporting to law enforcement — an issue that has been key for activists.
“There is still an issue and the actual rates of sexual assault and the numbers reported to police because sometimes survivors don’t feel comfortable going through the legal process since historically police have not been survivor-centric and have not provided trauma-informed care,” Jha said.

The Georgetown University Student Association has purchased online subscription passes to the New York Times, providing a short-term fix to the cut of Georgetown’s Collegiate Readership Program in March. These 24-hour passes allow up to 100 students to use The New York Times site at one time, and cost GUSA around $800 per eight-week period.
GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) worked with senators on GUSA’s Finance and Appropriations Committee to develop a cost-effective short-term solution to respond to the student need for a news source.
“We got a lot of student reaction that was negative to the cutting of the Collegiate Readership Program, and we saw it as valuable,” Tezel said. “We had agreed with Fin/App that there might have been more cost-effective ways to get news to students, but we didn’t think that this program should be cut altogether. Recognizing that students wanted the news, wanted these newspapers, we wanted to provide something in the short term that would show that GUSA is still prioritizing this as a service before we move into next year.”
Before the Collegiate Readership Program was cut from GUSA’s budget for fiscal year 2015, it provided free print copies of The Washington Post, The New York Times and USA Today in locations around campus, including Sellinger Lounge, Red Square and Lauinger Library. Last year, the program received $14,000 in funding.
The New York Times paywall blocks those without a subscription from viewing more than 10 articles per month. The Washington Post charges $9.99 a month for unlimited online access, although this fee is waived for readers with an email address ending in “.edu.”
Meredith Cheney (COL ’16), a GUSA senator on the Fin/App committee, said that The New York Times online subscriptions worked well because they allow GUSA to analyze how many students use the program each day. Before cutting Collegiate Readership, GUSA members said they suspected students were not fully taking advantage of the program, but did not have a way to measure that claim.
“The New York Times financially made sense, and provided online passes, which we would be able to analyze data on usage,” Cheney said. “It was important to us to be able to evaluate whether people were actually going to use online subscriptions like they said they would.”
According to Cheney, GUSA is working to create a more long-term system, potentially expanding to reach more Georgetown students, including those in graduate and continuing studies programs. A factor in the decision to cut the Collegiate Readership print program was the belief that graduate students and professors were taking advantage of the free newspapers earlier in the day, before undergraduates got to them.
“Long-term speaking, we are hoping to work with the library and also faculty and staff, as well as departments across campus including continuing studies and graduate students to implement a campus-wide program,” Cheney said. “That would be my ultimate hope. Also, on the sustainability front I think it would be wise to strongly consider going completely online.”
Cheney said she hopes that the program can evolve to include a variety of online sources.
“I think that being on a college campus is very much a bubble, and you have to put effort in to burst that bubble,” Cheney said. “I think it’s important to first be diverse in your intellectual scope, and I think it’s also important to be able to decipher which news source you want to educate yourself with. I hope that we can work with Georgetown to diversify our sources.”
Although GUSA has provided an online subscription to students, Jack Bennett (COL ’17) said that he still plans to push for print newspapers on campus.
“Our generation is not aware of the world around us. We read BuzzFeed and Huffington Post and get our news like that,” Bennett said. “There have been a number of studies coming out in the field of sociology on when you have people getting their information from the internet, people are only going to websites that support the views that they already have.”
Bennett said that he believes that The New York Times subscription is a good start on the way to a more robust readership program, but worries that solely online content could be intellectually detrimental.
“I think that if we were to keep not reading the newspaper and it was to eventually just become online stuff, I think that people would totally phase out anything that disagreed with their preconceived notions of how the world works, and there is so much more depth to a lot of issues that people don’t approach with BuzzFeed and everything else,” Bennett said.

No self respecting student reads HuffPo or Buzzfeed for news, just saying…
Also, you can just clear your cache or go on incognito to refresh your nyt article limit (but the readership passes are great to have).

People have always been more likely to read things they think they will agree with – it’s not a new thing brought on by the internet. In New York, liberals usually read the Times and conservatives usually read the Journal, and I’m sure it’s the same in every other city. Just because people are clicking instead of picking up their paper of choice does not mean that the underlying pattern has changed.
Also, I really hope people aren’t getting their news from BuzzFeed’s “13 Things Wrong With The World This Week” or “26 Reasons You Should Pay Attention To The News Today” articles (those are fake titles, but I’m sure similar ones exist). It’s one thing to read BuzzFeed for a 3 minute distraction during work, but it’s published maybe 2 decent articles in its history. Students should look to the NYT, WSJ, WashPo, the Economist, Financial Times, Al Jazeera, BBC, etc… if they want anything substantial. All of those can be found online (some for free, some on a trial basis) and all are much better sources of information than BuzzFeed.

In response to the U.S. News and World Report National University Rankings, The New York Times will release its own college ranking system, focusing on socioeconomic diversity, at its Schools for Tomorrow conference Sept. 8 in New York City. The rankings will be based on the ability of the universities to attract underprivileged students.
Georgetown has placed reliably around number 20 for years on the U.S. News rankings, which measures average class size, retention rate, student SAT/ACT scores and graduation rate as well as faculty salaries, financial resources and alumni giving rates.
David Leonhardt, managing editor of The Upshot, The Times’ website on politics, policy and economics that has produced the rankings, told The Chronicle of Higher Education that the ranking is not meant to be comprehensive but rather aims to highlight the pursuit of greater socioeconomic diversity in higher education.
“We’re in no way trying to compete with the various ‘best school’ rankings out there,” Leonhardt told The Chronicle.
University of Florida President Bernie Machen, who will speak on a panel after the rankings are revealed, told The Hoya that “underprivileged” refers in an abstract sense to students of “different life experiences and different backgrounds” and, more concretely, is based largely upon the percentage of students receiving Federal Pell Grants. He agreed that The New York Times’ rankings are not aiming to determine definitely the best colleges for students to attend.
“They don’t think of this ranking of theirs as the most comprehensive,” Machen said. “You’ll have to decide if that’s the most important thing to you, being the parent and the student.”
Both Vassar College and the University of Florida were chosen to speak at the conference because of their dedication to socioeconomic diversity, Machen said. According to Machen, University of Florida’s percentage of Pell Grant recipients is up to double that of Ivy League universities.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said that while Georgetown’s percentage of Pell Grant recipients, at 10.8 percent, more closely resembles that of the universities in the Ivy League than Florida’s 30 percent rate, the university’s selectiveness limits its ability to admit a large amount of low-income students who have fewer opportunities to meet the standards of elite institutions.
“I think the greater issue starts with the beginning that there aren’t enough kids coming along with the level of academic talent and background it’s going to take to fill up lots of spaces at these very top institutions,” Deacon said.
According to Deacon, endowment is also a limiting factor.
“For a place like Georgetown to have 50 percent Pell Grant, we would need to have someone give us about $5 billion in financial aid to meet the need of those students at the level of equality,” Deacon said.
Anthony Carnevale, director of the McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center on Education and the Workforce, agreed, pointing to Georgetown’s endowment , which is smaller than those of universities in the Ivy League.
“At some level, the rankings are aspiration, and they’re a little bit unfair,” Carnevale said. “What is stunning about Georgetown … is that the graduation rate for low-income and minority kids at Georgetown is just as high as the overall graduation rate, and it’s well above 90 percent.”
Deacon similarly noted the high graduation rate of low-income students as well as the Georgetown Scholarship Program as alternative indicators of Georgetown’s relative success in socioeconomic diversity.
“Getting in is step one, getting through is the key. And not only getting through, but getting through with pride, with accomplishment and with opportunities that are on the equal playing field with the rest of your students,” Deacon said. “How do you measure that in this New York Times poll?”
However, Machen said the U.S. News rankings are no more comprehensive than The New York Times rankings would be.
“At least they’re honest about it. To say that [the U.S. News Rankings are] a comprehensive ranking is a joke,” he said. “There are other things that are important.”
Nora Gordon, a specialist in education and economics in the McCourt School of Public Policy, believes the new ranking system could highlight the inequalities in existing rankings.
“I think one potential benefit of having a system like this could be to actually make people discount the other rankings, even if it doesn’t make them care a lot about these rankings,” she said.
Though Machen agreed that the rankings were not ideal indicators, he believed they would play an important role in indicating the affordability of colleges for students of limited means.
“I’m not sure it’s a perfect surrogate for diversity,” he said. “But it does show that kids who don’t have the economic means of the middle class kids can come here and not be put into big debt.”
Despite continuing debates on metrics for economic diversity, the rankings’ mission to draw attention to economic factors in higher education has been well-received.
“I imagine the primary benefit of this will be just kind of shining a light on the disparities that exist and basically the lack of representation of low-income students at elite institutions.” Gordon said.

In response to several campus safety concerns from students and administrators last spring, the university has introduced LiveSafe, a new mobile application that focuses on addressing campus safety through a simple virtual platform. The application, which replaced the EmergenSee app, became available to Georgetown students at the start of New Student Orientation last month.
LiveSafe is currently active at various universities, including Arizona State University and Virginia Tech, but has been modified to meet Georgetown’s specific safety needs.
“There have been trainings done for the police dispatchers, communication with the NSO leaders and a lot of activity will be taking place within the next weeks and months talk through how best to market the app at Georgetown,” LiveSafe Founder Shy Pahlevani said.
The application includes several unique features to promote safety on campus. An essential component of the app is to provide a comprehensive place for students to call and message law enforcement in order to change how students interact with the Georgetown Police Department and the wider campus community.
“LiveSafe is a two-way communication tool between students, campus police and the school administration,” Pahlevani said.
Students can report concerns to GUPD directly through an online messaging system. The system includes the option for students to send tips anonymously.
“The Georgetown University Police Department has a communication consult in their office and [students] can have a continued conversation and it remains anonymous,” Pahlevani said. “It focuses on breaking down the barriers to communication by making it really simple, intuitive and easy to share information.”
GUPD Chief Jay Gruber is optimistic about the increased efficiency and communication options through the LiveSafe application.
“When a tip is submitted, [it] funnels through our communications center and it’s the responsibility of the communications person to acknowledge that we got their tip,” Gruber said. “If it’s an emergency, we are going to dispatch officers to the scene immediately.”
The innovative app also allows students to customize the tips about specific incidents, such as vandalism or assault, and send them to campus law enforcement. Students can also include pictures, audio and video with their tips.
“LiveSafe hopes to empower students to choose what they want to share with the broader campus community,” Pahlevani said.
The tips will instantly be sent to GUPD, where officers will address the safety issues.
“LiveSafe helps facilitate information sharing about safety in a real-time manner. We envision students using this app to communicate directly not only with each other, but also with the authorities to more quickly disseminate urgent information about campus safety,” Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) wrote in an email.
The app also includes SafeWalk, a feature that allows students to select contacts to virtually track their walk from one place to another, in order to ensure that they safely arrive at their destination. It aims to provide students with an additional layer of security as they walk alone.
“[SafeWalk] can track you in real time with your selected emergency contacts. … It makes it really easy to contact campus police if needed,” Pahlevani said. “It’s these engaging features that draw Georgetown students in.”
The LiveSafe application hopes to eventually include a feature similar to one featured in TapRide, an older app, that allows students to order a SafeRides vehicle and track it in real-time.
“It’s a nice platform on which we can expand and it’s a really simple way for students to become connected to us,” Gruber said. “Texting is so natural and just pulling up the app is so easy.”
LiveSafe and GUPD are currently working with campus partners and groups such as InterHall,
GUSA, University Information Services and others to advertise the app and encourage all members of the Georgetown community to download it.
“It’s a continuous process. We are going to work on marketing throughout the entire year to convince students that it’s important enough to take 30 seconds to download [LiveSafe],”  Gruber said.

The Healey Family Student Center, located below the New South Residence Hall, opens today after years of planning and months of construction.
The university is celebrating the inauguration with tours and free food from noon to 5 p.m. today and a casino night from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m.
Although today marks a soft opening of the center, targeted toward students, an official dedication ceremony featuring the donors and a blessing of the new space will take place Oct. 8.
Currently, the HFSC features a great room, with two fireplaces and a dais for events and performances, along with 12 study rooms and three larger conference rooms. The student center also has four music practice rooms, each of which has a piano, and two dance studios for use by student groups. The great room overlooks the Potomac River.
“Chairs will be lined up toward the window to take advantage of the views and all the natural light. There’s a lot of natural light from the skylights and also from the windows,” Center for Student Engagement Director Erika Cohen Derr said.
Cohen Derr said that building’s incorporation of natural light allows for the minimization of fluorescent lights. Additonally, some rooms within the HFSC include automatic lights operated by motion sensors in order to minimize excess power use. The university is striving to attain LEED Gold Certification for the HFSC, although the application for the certification can only be submitted once the center is complete.
The other main attractions of the center will open later in the semester. The opening date for the newly-named pub, Bulldog Tavern, is set for Oct. 31, while Hilltoss, the new Students of Georgetown Inc. storefront, will open Nov. 1.
The name for Bulldog Tavern, which was chosen through a student-wide vote, was announced Thursday. Another student-wide vote will be held at the end of the month to select the pub’s logo, which will be student-designed.
The HFSC is two stories, and its elevators allow those with physical disabilities to access New South without ascending the steep hill on Library Walk.
A yet-to-be-built terrace financed by a $2.2 million allocation of the Student Activities Fund is planned outside the great room. It should be open within four to six weeks, according to Cohen Derr. Another deck is located outside the pub.
“All of this in the original design wasn’t there. It was all because of student activism and work to reform the endowment process that they had a campus referendum, everyone voted and they voted in favor of giving $2.2 million to create this terrace,” Cohen Derr said.
For the time being, the center will be open from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. on weekdays and from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. on weekends. Once the pub opens, the hours will expand to match the later hours of Bulldog Tavern, which will stay open until 3 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights. Cohen Derr said the Center for Student Engagement plans to keep the center open 24 hours during final examinations. Longer hours will be considered once student interest is assessed.

As testing continues for the D.C. Streetcar project, operation of the public transportation line is set to begin later this year, after a series of delays plagued the project.
Construction is complete on the H Street/Benning Road line connecting Union Station to Oklahoma Avenue in the northeast quadrant of the city. Testing began near the end of July as drivers learned how to maneuver traffic and control the unwieldy vehicles. Reggie Sanders, spokesperson for the District Department of Transportation, said that the project was on schedule to open later this year.
“We now have four cars moving up and down traversing the streetcar system between H Street and Benning. We are doing operator training, and we have 30 operators that have now completed their training,” Sanders said. “That’s very good news towards certifying the system, so we’re really happy with our progress.”
The streetcar runs on rails built into the streets, so operators can merely accelerate and decelerate — albeit slowly — along the track; they cannot change lanes in the street. Consequently, in addition to the 30 hours of required training, the testing process is of vital importance in familiarizing the operators with the road, and allowing drivers along the H Street/Benning Road corridor to learn safe practices while operating near streetcars.
Because the streetcar occupies one lane of the road, potentially increasing vehicular traffic in the area, the DDOT released proposed regulations limiting cycling on H Street in areas with rails. They will accept comments on the proposal until Sept. 27.
“We’re recommending that cyclists not be allowed to ride between the rails east and west on the streetcar because there’s simply not enough room,” Sanders said. “It’s not safe for cyclists to ride in front of the train and ride opposite or to the left or to the right of the train. There’s just not enough room. There’s too much vehicular traffic there to do that safely.”
To ensure cyclists still have a way to traverse the corridor, the DDOT installed “contraflow” lanes on G Street and I Street to the north and south of the streetcar line.
However, the Washington Area Bicyclist Association pointed out that H Street was a vital business corridor that cyclists could not reach anymore and urged the DDOT to make the street safer for bicycles to traverse.
“On H Street, the guideway is the entire street, effectively banning biking in this popular corridor. This is a problem,” WABA Communications Coordinator Colin Browne wrote in a post on the organization’s website.
The increased room required on the street for the vehicles has also caused a spike in parking tickets along the line, as previously available parking spaces have been eliminated to make room for the streetcar. The Department of Public Works reported giving out 143 tickets since July 24.
Sanders remained confident, however, that the community was still embracing the project.
“When you’re doing something this big, there’s always going to be concerns. We’ve reached out to many groups of people, and that includes businesses, to explain the effect it will have on them,” he said. “We work hard to keep everyone informed and to manage expectations and also to work with them on any problems that may have come about.”
The modern streetcar revives a dormant Washington, D.C. tradition for the first time in 50 years, though only after nearly a decade of deliberation. Although DDOT broke ground in 2004 on a line in the Anacostia district, the project faced contracting issues and delays that led to the project being shut down.
Despite the hiccups, the opening of the streetcar line in D.C. follows similar projects in cities like Atlanta and, according to Sanders, heralds more options for public transportation in the city.
“Streetcars are really short-trip ways of getting around town, and we’re moving towards a multi-modal transportation effort, where you can use bus or rail or car,” he said. “It’s of great value to the residents that live in those areas and the people who come to visit Washington.”
Current plans feature six stops along the way. Although the current line does not cross the Anacostia River, future development of the Streetcar system plans to include an extension across the waterway into Ward 7, as well as an extension in the other direction to Georgetown, which would make the system more accessible to students.
Sanders declined to comment on possible expansions.
John Reilly (COL ’17) said that he didn’t see the new streetcars having much of an effect on Georgetown students.
“It’s certainly an interesting idea. Right now, I can’t see the cars having a big impact on student life as they’re so far from the Hilltop. If a line is created connecting Georgetown and Union Station, it would be a great and easy way for students to cross the district,” Reilly said.
