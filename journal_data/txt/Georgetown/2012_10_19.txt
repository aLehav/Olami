Despite a drop in the D.C. area’s homicide rate, less than a third of homicide cases have led to a conviction in the past decade.
According to a study by The Washington Post, the decrease in D.C.’s homicide rate in the city represents significant progress for a city that was once labeled the “murder capital of the country” during the early 1990s. At its peak in 1991 the number of homicides was 482. Since then the number has fallen to 108 homicides in 2011.
Similarly, the recently reported homicide closure rate represents an improvement over past years. The closure rate for homicides in the district has risen from 49 percent in 2001 to 94 percent in 2011.
Georgetown, which has traditionally seen a lower crime rate than the rest of the city, has also seen a decreasing homicide rate. According to The Post’s report, the last homicide that occurred at the university was the murder of 20-year-old David Shick (MSB ’01) near the Healy Gates in 2000.
Just outside the university gates, however, the murder rate increases slightly, with the recent 2011 murders of Tyronn Garner on M Street last Oct. 31 and Viola Drath Aug. 12, 2011, near Wisconsin Avenue.
In the last decade, a total of five homicides were committed in the Georgetown neighborhood, which includes Burleith-Hillandale, West Village Georgetown, Waterfront Georgetown and East Village Georgetown.
The Metropolitan Police Department closed four of the homicides, giving the Georgetown area an 80 percent closure rate.
“I appreciate the support and collaboration we have with MPD and are fortunate that there are very few homicides in the area and none involving the university community,” Jay Gruber, chief of police and director of the Department of Public Safety, said.
Nonetheless, the small sample size of homicides in Georgetown makes the area difficult to compare to some of the city’s more dangerous neighborhoods, which contribute to the more than 1,000 homicides still left unsolved.

After turning to the Georgetown University Student Association for financing last March, the Georgetown University Lecture Fund has experienced a $16,233 increase in funding this year.
The group had previously been funded by the Student Activities Commission since 2008.
“We made the switch because we wanted to ensure that more students and student groups could get as much funding as possible for the fantastic speakers they’d like to bring in a matter that is straightforward and more transparent,” Lecture Fund Vice Chair of Internal Affairs Chris Mulrooney (COL ’14) said.
This year, GUSA allocated $60,000 in one lump sum to the Lecture Fund — a 37-percent increase from last year’s budget under SAC — and will continue to earmark funds for the group annually. Last year, SAC granted the Lecture Fund a total of $43,767 on an event-by-event basis.
The prior process for funding speaker events through SAC was confusing, and it was difficult to organize events with non-SAC groups, according to Mulrooney.
Aanika Patel (SFS ’13), Lecture Fund vice chair for external affairs, agreed.
“[Under SAC,] I would start making the motions for getting the contract and getting good sponsors for an event, and eventually, we would have to cancel because we just didn’t have the funding,” she said. “Now that GUSA gives us this lump sum for the entire year, it makes planning, at least from my perspective, a lot easier.”
Despite the increase in funding, the $60,000 total still falls $145,000 short of the Lecture Fund’s $205,000 request for this academic year. Because of scarce monetary resources, members must negotiate with speakers to lower prices.
“Given that in a typical year we organize or oversee in excess of 50 speaking events, we stretch this budget extremely far,” Lecture Fund Chair Sean Keady (SFS ’13) said.
According to Patel, the Lecture Fund aims to keep the cost of all events under $5,000.
“A lot of times speakers and agents will give you the runaround,” Patel said. “We don’t have a great budget, so it’s really presenting the organization and Georgetown in a way that makes speakers want to come here for more than just that check they’re going to get in the mail afterward.”
To accommodate expensive speakers, the Lecture Fund collaborates with other organizations to finance and plan events. One such source of support is the Karl F. Landegger Program in International Business Diplomacy, which helped fund the audiovisual components for an Oct. 9 event featuring Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of the Capital One Financial Corp.
“I was pleased with the type of outreach and the level of professionalism the Lecture Fund students exhibited.  I am a big fan of co-sponsorship, especially when we can connect communities and distribute the burden of cost and management,” Program Counselor Rosaelena O’Neil said. “I look forward to working with them again.”
This year, the Lecture Fund aims to maximize the number of students it impacts through a calendar of diverse events.
“My goal for this year is to try to reach as many students as possible with a wide variety of events that appeal to everyone,” Keady said. “And that doesn’t mean big, huge famous people. That means speakers that cater to individual interests.”
Last year, the Lecture Fund sponsored 64 speaker events, up from a total of 50 events in the 2010-2011 academic year, and it organized 17 of those 64 events independently. According to Mulrooney, the group aims to organize at least 60 events this year and has already held 17 of 22 events planned for this semester, including the appearances of Perlin, actress Rosario Dawson and Doug Ellin, the creator of the HBO television show “Entourage.”

LEONEL DE VELEZ/THE HOYASecretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke about the importance of energy and its status as a 21st-century foreign policy priority in Gaston Hall Thursday afternoon.
Dean of the School of Foreign Service Carol Lancaster introduced Clinton, calling her a “Hoya by marriage” and lauding her years of work in government.
“Secretary Clinton has come to embody the Georgetown spirit of public service,” Lancaster said.
Clinton began her talk by outlining the impact of energy concerns on international affairs, saying that the issue is at the core of geopolitics, economic growth and global development.
“Fundamentally, energy is a source of wealth and power, which means it can be both a source of conflict and cooperation,” she said. “Energy cuts across the entirety of U.S. foreign policy.”
She also detailed the Obama administration’s recent initiatives to develop a more progressive and independent energy policy.
“Many Americans don’t yet realize the gains that the United States has made,” she said, citing increased use of wind, solar and natural gas and the implementation of new automobile fuel efficiency standards.
“We are less reliant on imported energy, which strengthens our global economic and political standing,” she said. “The important thing to keep in mind is our country is not and cannot be an island when it comes to energy markets.”
Under Clinton’s leadership, the Department of State created a new Bureau of Energy Resources that orchestrates the department’s diplomatic efforts on energy.
“We did not have a team of experts dedicated full time to thinking creatively about how we can solve challenges and seize opportunities, and now we do,” Clinton said. “That … is a signal of a broader commitment on the part of the United States to lead in shaping the global energy future.”
Here, Clinton turned and pointed to the front row, where six Georgetown alumni who work in the bureau were sitting.
“That’s a shameless pitch for the Foreign Service and the State Department,” she said.
Clinton went on to explain the three pillars of the Department of State’s policies on energy: energy diplomacy, energy transformation and energy poverty. She cited the department’s efforts in Iran, Sudan and South Sudan, Iraq and the Arctic and said that the United States must play a role in preventing conflict over energy resources.
Clinton also spoke of the necessity of transitioning to cleaner energy sources, arguing that the United States has the knowledge and resources to promote green energy in other countries. She talked about a new initiative, “Connecting the Americas 2022,” that aims to provide universal access to electricity in the Americas within 10 years.
“Interconnection will help us get the most out of our region’s resources,” she said. “It really is a win-win-win in our opinion.”
In terms of energy poverty, Clinton detailed her administration’s efforts to promote transparency and equal access to energy in developing countries.
“Poor governance … is a key factor in energy poverty and political instability,” she said. “We need to ensure that energy resources don’t cause more suffering than good.”
Overall, Clinton promoted an active role for the United States in global energy issues.
“We have no choice. … We have to be involved,” she said. “The challenges I’ve outlined will only become more urgent in the years ahead … and all of us have a stake in the outcome.”
Matthew McManus (GRD ’90), deputy director of public diplomacy and policy analysis in the Bureau of Energy Resources, shared how Georgetown should get involved in the conversation about sustainability.
“It is important for us to engage the next generation and to really have a debate about the best path forward for energy security, our planet and the environment,” he said.

Georgetown’s Department of Emergency Management and Operational Continuity was awarded an Honorable Mention in the 2012 FEMA Individual and Community Preparedness Awards for its “Outstanding Community Emergency Response Team Initiative” Oct. 9.
According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s website, “[The Individual and Community Preparedness Awards] recognize outstanding individuals, organizations, Citizen Corps Councils and programs working to make our communities safer, stronger and better prepared for any disaster or emergency event.”
The Campus Community Emergency Response Team was started at Georgetown in July 2010 to provide emergency assistance to professional first responders in case of a disaster. Students and faculty trained by C-CERT are added to a special Hoya Alert list-serve if their services are needed in an emergency.
“We believe that Georgetown’s C-CERT Team and the Building and Floor Marshals deserve this award because of their consistent dedication and professionalism,” Department of Emergency Management and Operational ContinuityDirector WhitChaiyabhatwrote in an email. “Both groups are comprised entirely of individual volunteers, which speaks highly to the Jesuit values and culture of cura personalis and caring for others embraced at Georgetown.”
FEMA’s National Office of Citizen Corps praised the Georgetown department’s commitment to safety and preparedness.
“Thank you so much for promoting and sharing with us the amazing work that you do to help prepare your communities for disaster,” the National Office of Citizen Corps wrote in an email sent to announce the award on Oct. 12.
The award is listed on the Citizen Corps website, and Georgetown will receive a certificate from FEMA in recognition of its accomplishments.
“We believe our model for CERT at Georgetown has provided the region with a successful and cost-effective strategy for achieving community engagement on the topic of shared disaster preparedness,”Chaiyabhat wrote. “Emergency preparedness is a shared responsibility, at the core of community engagement and leadership, which aligns very well with the history and tradition at Georgetown University.”
Since the Department of Emergency Management and Operational Continuityfounding in the fall of 2007, the department has worked to make Georgetown more resilient in the face of disasters through training and educating the community, according to Chaiyabhat
“We think we have created an effective marriage of ‘programs’ and ‘community culture’ at Georgetown and are not surprised that Georgetown’s C-CERT is being recognized by our federal emergency management leaders for its various successes and endeavors,” he wrote.
Georgetown was the only college or university to be recognized by FEMA for the Individual and Community Preparedness Awards this year.
Georgetown’s C-CERT has expanded this past year and began training 40 new members Thursday.
“I think [FEMA] saw that we took on a strong role in our area based on our growing teams and our growing participation,” member David Lizza (COL ’15) said. “I’m proud to be part of Georgetown’s C-CERT that received the award from FEMA. It’s important for our campus, especially because we’re in D.C., to be prepared for any emergency.”

D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray recently announced a new scholarship fund for graduates of D.C. high schools who come from low-income families and will be attending universities in the District.
Gray set aside $1.59 million in the District’s fiscal year 2013 budget for the fund and has given $1.2 million to 185 students this year.
“Creating a college-going culture begins with instilling the idea that college is an important and attainable aspiration, regardless of one’s financial situation,” State Superintendent of Education Hosanna Mahaley Jones said at the Oct. 5 press conference. “By expanding students’ local college choices and financial accessibility, we also expand their opportunities for success.”
According to Lauralyn Lee, Georgetown’s associate vice president of community engagement and strategic initiatives, the university is a firm supporter of this new program.
“The university is deeply invested in programs that support the success of students from the District of Columbia,” she wrote in an email. “We have enthusiastically supported this latest program.”
The scholarship was partially orchestrated by alumna Emily Durso, the assistant superintendent for postsecondary and career education at the Office of the State Superintendent, and provides $10,000 for students attending private schools, $7,000 for those attending the University of the District of Columbia and $3,000 for those enrolled in the city’s community college.
In order to receive a scholarship, students must be in good academic and disciplinary standing in their high schools and come from families who are considered low income by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.
“Today’s announcement means it will be easier for many District students to obtain a university or community college degree,” Gray said at the press conference. “It’s a wise investment in our students, our workforce and our city’s future.”
The new scholarships come in addition to the D.C. Tuition Assistance Grant, which already provided $2,500 for local students attending private universities in the District.
Lee added that despite its need-blind admissions policy, Georgetown actively supports programs that enhance student access to college programs.
“We are firmly committed to supporting programs that promote access to college regardless of institution, as this one does,” she wrote.

The number of packages received by Georgetown University’s Residence Hall Offices has increased 58 percent since fiscal year 2005, pushing some RHOs’ resources to their limits.
According to data provided by Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, RHOs received a total of 116,491 packages in fiscal year 2012, compared to 73,741 in 2005, and the annual total has risen every year in between. The total is expected to grow again in fiscal year 2013 — RHOs across campus have received 46,693 packages since July.
Georgetown University Facilities and Student Housing hires extra staff at RHOs to work during peak delivery times and heavy-volume periods near holidays to accommodate for the volume of packages, according to Pugh.
But an anonymous RHO employee said that the amount of packages has had a negative effect on RHO employees’ work environment.
“We come in and see 300 packages roll in with UPS or FedEx, and we know it’s going to be a cramped next hour or two trying to log, sort and label all these packages in a space that’s already small and crowded,” he said.
University Facilities has taken steps to deal with the rising number of packages, according to Pugh.
“[W]e have made creative use of current space and storage to increase the number of packages that can be held,” she wrote in an email.
For example, the Village C West RHO has been making use of the floor lounge as an overflow area. The RHOs have also added extra package pick-up hours to make it easier for “We are actively searching for additional improvements, knowing that our current spaces are at or near their maximums,” Pugh wrote.
Despite these measures, the RHO employee said there is still a lack of support from the main housing staff.
“While we’re going through this tough time, [the housing staff] seems unsympathetic to the rising problem and unwilling to find a solution other than ‘do your best,’” he said.
In terms of solutions, the options are limited. Building more and larger RHOs is unlikely, according to the RHO employee.
“For the short term, better support and a forward-looking approach from [the Office of Housing and Residence Life] are all we can hope for,” he said.
According to Pugh, the VCW RHO generally receives more packages than any other — around 200 each weekday — followed by the New South RHO. The RHO employee said he believes the high numbers are a result of the concentration of freshmen, who typically receive larger items and a greater volume of packages than upperclassmen, in these dorms.
Students say the increase in packages corresponds to the growing popularity of online shopping.
“For a college such as Georgetown, with few [stores] in close proximity, students prefer the ease of online shopping and the expedient delivery,” Michael Davidson (COL ’15) said.
Alicia Chavy (SFS ’14) said that she buys online because of the high prices of nearby stores and the difficulties associated with getting out of Washington, D.C., to shop
“Everything around Georgetown is so expensive,” Chavy said. “And I don’t have a car on campus to go shopping in Virginia or other areas.”
Davidson said he has sensed some disorganization at his RHO.
“Packages that were supposed to be delivered to my dorm, LXR, were instead delivered to VCW … which is quite a hassle,” Davidson said, adding that this has happened on numerous occasions.
Unlike Davidson, however, Chavy has not noticed a lackluster performance in her RHO in Kennedy Hall.
“From what I have experienced,” Chavy said, “[RHO] has a really good organizational system for its packages.”

KAYLA NOGUCHI/THE HOYAJames Mann (pictured) and Tom Hamburger, both writers and former journalists, spoke about the fast-evolving dynamics of the presidential race at an event in the Mortara Center Tuesday.Author James Mann and The Washington Post correspondent Tom Hamburger discussed politics, foreign policy and the presidential race in Georgetown’s Mortara Center for International Studies Tuesday afternoon.
Hamburger, a reporter for The Post’s national desk and a former writer for the Los Angeles Times, summarized the presidential campaign and explained why it has become a closer race in the most recent weeks.
“A few weeks ago, there was a feeling that Mitt Romney was so full of bombast and had been so successfully caricatured as a greedy titan of Wall Street, and the economic numbers were trending Barack Obama’s way, that political reporters began to wonder if the presidential election was really over — that we should put our attention more to Congressional races,” Hamburger said.
However, Hamburger noted that during the final month before the presidential election, there often is an October surprise, a pivotal development that occurs late in the race.
“This year, the October surprise was what some were referring to as the ‘Obama no-show’ in the [first] debate,” Hamburger said. “I think that the Obama performance in that debate contributed to what I would call a sense of unease.”
Hamburger argued that despite some signs of economic recovery, such as the drop in the national unemployment rate, there is still a sense of anxiety among Americans about the nation’s status internationally.
 “It’s rather not a specific economic unease as much as a subtle and diffuse one that does relate to America’s place in the world,” he said.
According to Mann, an author-in-residence at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, a former reporter for the Los Angeles Times and author of several books on politics and foreign policy, the renewed focus on international issues is a Romney campaign strategy.
“My own theory is that [Romney is] talking about foreign policy now as a stand-in for leadership,” Mann said. “He’s talking about these issues in a way that will show he is a strong leader, and people can then transfer [that idea] over to the economy.”
Mann added that domestic issues still hold sway with the electorate.
“I’m certain that the polls show that the public cares multiple times more about the domestic economy and jobs than it does about the consulate in Benghazi,” Mann said, referring to the attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya last month that killed American Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
Mann also spoke about his most recent book, “The Obamians, which explores President Obama’s prediction of the country’s long-term future. In his book, Mann divides the Obama campaign team into three different generations: the post-Vietnam generation, the post-Cold War generation of the 1990s, and the “Obamians” — those who came of age in the 2000s.
“The Obamians represent an effort to redo American strategy, to have a lighter footprint in the world, to no longer act assuming that America is and always will have a position of primacy in the world,” Mann said. “That the day will come when the United States is not necessarily the most powerful nation in the world, and … the country needs to start getting ready for it.”
Both speakers discussed the importance of China as a debate topic.
Mann noted that both President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wanted to label China as a currency manipulator during their presidential campaigns in 2008 but did not follow through once in office.
“They took office, and they passed up one chance after another to do that because the belief was that China would take umbrage and there would be a trade war,” Mann said.
In Tuesday’s debate, Gov. Romney reiterated his promise to label China a currency manipulator. However, Mann challenged the effectiveness of his proposed action.
“What [Gov. Romney] doesn’t say is that actually, for all this talk from three candidates, declaring China a currency manipulator does not by itself change anything,” Mann said. “There is no action required as a result of declaring China a currency manipulator. Effectively, what Romney is saying is, ‘I won’t change anything, but I’ll stick it in China’s eye.’”
Hamburger linked the idea of China as a problem or threat to the concept of American unease.
“U.S. trade relations with China, as well as a fear of China as a risen power, reflect this concern about where we’re going,” he said. “The foreign policy issues that Romney is now raising … are an attempt to fire up this concern about America’s place in the world and also instill doubts about Obama’s ability to lead.”

JOY CHAY JEONG MA/THE HOYAFr. Christopher Steck, S.J., spoke at the fifth anniversary celebration for the LGBTQ Center in Riggs Library Wednesday.In the five years since its founding, the LGBTQ Resource Center has helped reframe the issue of sexual orientation at Georgetown.
The center, which celebrated its anniversary Wednesday, was established as a result of the Out for Change Campaign, which began in the fall of 2007 after a student was verbally assaulted because of his sexual orientation. In response to the incident, members of GU Pride petitioned the university to develop a procedure to address hate crimes on campus, gathering approximately 750 signatures within six hours.
“The campus climate for the LGBTQ community was far different five years ago than it is today,” Scott Chessare (SFS ’10), former co-president of GU Pride and one of the leaders of the rally in Red Square that launched the campaign in 2007, said. “It was fractured, divided, not really united. We thought there was a general lack of institutional support.”
“Before Out for Change we had no full-time employee dealing with LGBTQ issues here on campus,” former GU Pride historian Ben McAfee (SFS ’12) said.
As a freshman, McAfee participated in the Red Square rally and helped organize a student presentation to University President John J. DeGioia along with other representatives from GU Pride, College Democrats, Georgetown Solidarity Committee and Take Back the Night.
“We sat down for two to three hours every day until we could articulate what we wanted: education, safety and programming,” he said.
The students spread their message by holding pep rallies in Red Square, creating the now-ubiquitous “I am” T-shirts and handing out LGBTQ awareness flyers to prospective students. McAfee recalled being stopped by Department of Public Safety officers when he tried to enter DeGioia’s office with a group of other students to voice their demands.
“We left an ‘I am’ shirt with his secretary,” McAfee said.
The response from DeGioia was both immediate and comprehensive. He announced the creation of three working groups that addressed areas of reporting, resources and education based on the campaign’s demands. The recommendations of these working groups led to the creation of the LGBTQ Resource Center in August 2008.
“In [that] dark hour, there was a seed of opportunity to respond to what happened,” Chessare said. “I think that is something we saw five years ago [with] DeGioia’s courageous decision to commit to establishing the LGBTQ center, not in spite of our Catholic and Jesuit identity, but because of it.”
That perspective was voiced by Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Jeanne Lord at the center’s anniversary celebration Wednesday.
“When we walk across our campus and see the banners reminding us the values that characterize the Jesuit education — women and men for others, community and diversity — we will know these as lived values within this very special community,” Lord said. “We do this work at Georgetown precisely because we are a Catholic and Jesuit university.”
The center, which was the first of its kind at a Catholic University, quickly took hold. It provides a safe, informal place for students to discuss LGBTQ issues by appointment or at a coffee hour held each Friday.
“It’s just being a presence on a campus. … The resource center is something to take care of us as a whole person that at the same time supports the community as a whole,” GU Pride President Meghan Ferguson (COL ’15) said.
Despite Georgetown’s Jesuit background, there was no backlash when the center was created, according to Sivagami Subbaraman, director of the LGBTQ Resource Center.
“There is nothing that I know of where there was major resistance from either the Catholic or alumni community. In fact, I think most people were quite delighted because the work done is consistent with Catholic and Jesuit principles,” she said. “This is about educational opportunities, about access [and] about providing our students with all of the resources they need to get a full and complete education.”
Georgetown also began advising other Catholic universities on how to incorporate LGBTQ resources into campus life.
“We have been contacted by [other Catholic universities] who have seen how successful the Georgetown model is and are interested in replicating it on their own campuses,” Michael Deneen (COL ’14), a part-time student worker at the center, said.
But Deneen added that the center should be an impetus for further advocacy efforts.
“I hope [the movement] doesn’t lose its momentum,” he said. “Just because we have a center now doesn’t mean the work is over.”

The Social Innovation and Public Service Fund will officially begin soliciting project applications Friday afternoon.
The application will be launched at an event, “Improving Local and Global Communities Through Social Enterprise,” in the Fisher Colloquium, where Deloitte practitioners and SIPS Fund Executive Committee members will discuss ways to develop sustainable solutions to social problems.
The SIPS Fund was created through the Student Activities Fee Endowment reform referendum last February, which allocated a $1.5 million endowment to the fund.
“The purpose of the fund is to take that money and reinvest in Georgetown students and in their ideas with the goal of lowering the barrier for doing good in the world,” SIPS Fund Managing Director Tyler Sax (COL ’13) said. “And what that means, broken down, is making grants or loans to students who want to start their own non-profit or have a proposal for a research project that wouldn’t get funded otherwise.”
The application has been on the SIPS Fund website since the beginning of the semester, and the organization has received about 15 proposals thus far, according to Sax. Today’s application launch is the beginning of the fund’s advertising campaign.
Funding for projects will come from the interest that has accumulated on the endowment, which comprises funds raised between 2001 and 2011. All alumni who graduated in or after 2001 and thus contributed money to the fund through the student activities fee are also eligible to submit an application.
In the eight months since the SAFE referendum passed, the SIPS Fund has been working to establish itself as a public organization, and the fund became a legal entity on July 25.
“Friday marks the opening of our public period, the beginning of us being an outward facing body, whereas before, a lot of work was being done internally to be sure we had a good footing and that we had our evaluation criteria worked out and things like that,” Sax said.
The SIPS Fund looks at three criteria when evaluating proposals: impact on the applicant, impact on the community and whether the proposal is in line with Georgetown’s commitment to being men and women for others.
“What we’re looking for is students with innovative or creative ideas that maybe would fall through the cracks in the other structures that exist here on campus,” SIPS Fund Director of Communications Ethan Chess (COL ’14) said. “We’re looking for people who have innovative, game-changing kind of ideas, either on campus or in D.C. or around the world.”
The application process does not have a rigid structure or set time frames.
“We looked at a lot of other funds and saw that they had hard deadlines that people had to apply by,” Sax said. “We realized that innovation, entrepreneurship and ideas don’t come on a schedule. They don’t come on a timeline. So we wanted the SIPS Fund to reflect the true nature of entrepreneurship and innovation, and with that, we decided to have a rolling process, so people can apply to it at any time.”
The fund also plans to organize networking events throughout the semester.
“I would want to encourage people to apply,” Sax said. “But I would also encourage people to reach out to the SIPS Fund and attend our events as they see them, because we really believe in the strength of the potential for that community even beyond people who are applying for funding.”
Friday’s event is the ceremonial launch of a yearlong effort to establish the SIPS Fund.
“[The event] is going to mark the launch of our funding cycle. We’re now at a place … where we can start moving down the application pipeline we’ve established with different applicants,” Chess said. “Friday is a big day for us. We’re going to come to life.”
The Hoya’s editor-in-chief, Connor Gregoire, is a member of SIPS’ board of trustees.

The rise of college tuition costs has slowed to its lowest rate in 40 years, according to a survey conducted by the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.
The survey, the results of which were released Oct. 16, found that tuition at private institutions across the country rose by an average of 3.9 percent for the 2012-2013 school year. This is the first time on record that the rate of increase was less than 4 percent.
This year’s increase at Georgetown, however, is actually higher than in the past two years. Tuition at Georgetown rose by 3.5 percent between the 2011-2012 and the 2012-2013 school years, compared with a 2.9 percent increase from the 2010-2011 to the 2011-2012 academic years.
According to the NAICU study, the smaller rise in tuition was mirrored by a smaller increase in the availability of student financial aid. Aid increased by an average of 6.2 percent in the past year, a rate that is lower than the past several years. At private institutions across the nation aid increased by 7 percent in 2011-2012, 6.8 percent in 2010-2011 and 9 percent in 2009-10.
At Georgetown, financial aid increased by $1.9 million this year, and the university’s board of directors plans to increase aid by $4.7 million in 2013-2014 and $6.5 million in 2015-2016, according to the university’s five year plan.
