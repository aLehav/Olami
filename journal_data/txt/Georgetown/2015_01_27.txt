The Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility voted against GU Fossil Free’s divestment proposal Monday night and instead recommended to the university’s board of directors a program of targeted divestment, strategic engagement and continuing assessment as an alternative course of action.
The decision, which was originally scheduled to be released after CISR’s meeting Jan. 16, came after months of negotiations between GU Fossil Free, CISR and the university on GU Fossil Free’s proposal for the university to divest from the top 200 fossil fuel companies.
CISR, which consists of 12 voting members including four students, three professors and five university administrators, will present its recommendation to the Committee on Finance and Administration of the board of directors in a meeting in February.
According to a document released by CISR last night and a separate statement from CISR Chair and Georgetown University Law Center Associate Dean for Transitional Programs Jim Feinerman, the majority of CISR members voted against full divestment, though no tally was released. However, a majority also supported an alternative approach to divestment that reflects the moral, environmental and fiduciary concerns of the university.
“After lengthy discussion, CISR concurred with the need to act in light of these concerns, but did not support the proposal for full divestment submitted by Georgetown University Fossil Free,” the release read.
Instead, CISR’s recommendation offers targeted divestment as an alternative, specifically targeting the top 100 companies that cause significant environmental damage from coal mining. Subsequently, the recommendation exempts oil and gas companies from divestment. The CFA and the university’s Investment Office will identify the specific companies for divestment.
“Over a reasonable time period and consistent with good stewardship, Georgetown should divest from energy companies with the worst environmental impact, least commitment to alternative energy and least responsiveness to engagement efforts,” the release read. “Specifically, the university should divest from companies whose principal business is the mining of coal for use in energy production because there are energy alternatives that have less harmful environmental impact.”
CISR’s recommendation also calls for strategic engagement, which advocates for Georgetown to leverage its role as a shareholder of energy companies and to engage in active dialogue to reduce these companies’ harmful environmental impact.
“These efforts should include not only voting on, developing or supporting shareholder resolutions consistent with our principles, but also working with others to develop shareholder resolutions, and to seek opportunities to raise these issues in dialogue and communications with companies as well as other policymakers,” the release read.
The last part of the alternate solution proposed by CISR is the continued assessment of advances in the university’s environmental objectives. CISR recommends the appointment of a working group to produce a full review of the impact of targeted divestment and engagement after three years.
Additionally, a statement released by CISR Chair Jim Feinerman also stressed the importance of the university’s continued efforts in researching solutions and raising awareness about environmental issues.
“CISR further acknowledges and supports the work of academic departments of the university with relevant expertise that continue to contribute to the advancement of these goals with their resources, research and engagement in the public discourse on issues related to climate change, global warming and sustainability,” Feinerman wrote.
Three hours after CISR announced its decision, GU Fossil Free published a response on its website on behalf of the organization expressing disapproval of the CISR vote.
“The CISR’s decision not to support full divestment is disappointing,” the response read. “Partial divestment is an insufficient tactic, and, in light of the challenges at hand, is ideologically inconsistent with the CISR’s mandate to align Georgetown’s investments with its ethical standards.”
In particular, GU Fossil Free criticized the alternative plan for targeted divestment recommended by CISR, citing the insufficiency of only divesting from coal companies.
“Divestment from only coal would effectively legitimize other fossil fuel sectors whose products pose just as severe a threat to global human rights,” the response read. “While we would encourage divestment from any fossil fuel companies, partial divestment does not recognize the severity of the injustices perpetuated by the sector as a whole.”
GU Fossil Free also labeled CISR’s recommendations for strategic engagement and continued assessment as unrealistic.
“[S]hareholder advocacy efforts with companies whose objectionable behavior makes up the core of their business will never bring about the kind of adjustment that urgently needs to take place,” the response read. “These companies’ entire business model revolves around the unethical extraction and combustion of the carbon reserves they profess to own; engaging with these companies will not change this fact.”
Despite its disappointment with CISR’s recommendation, GU Fossil Free expressed hope for the board of directors to vote in favor of full divestment in February.
“We hope that members of the board of directors will favor a more decisive commitment to moral leadership and opt for comprehensive divestment from the top 200 fossil fuel companies across all sectors,” the release read.
A statement released by Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh praised the collective efforts of CISR and GU Fossil Free in engaging the university community in this dialogue regarding the university’s environmental responsibilities.
“We are grateful to the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility for their work and to GU Fossil Free for the important contributions they have made to the question of how we make and meet our sustainability goals, as it relates to our endowment and investments,” Pugh wrote.

The university’s first Hindu chaplain, Pratima Dharm, announced her imminent resignation from her position Jan. 22, citing personal reasons.
Dharm, 43, who began working at Georgetown in October, will leave the university Jan. 31 and said she will retire from the U.S. military, where she served as the Army’s first Hindu chaplain for eight years before taking her position at the university.
Dharm declined to elaborate on the reasons for her resignation.
In an email sent Jan. 23, Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., informed the Hindu community of Dharm’s decision and commended her for her work at Georgetown.
“We respect her decision to leave for personal reasons,” O’Brien wrote.“We appreciate that she did not make this decision lightly, as she enjoyed her ministry here, especially working with our students. We will miss her presence among us, and wish her the very best.”
Dharm, who spent only three months at Georgetown, expressed appreciation for the relationships she formed with students and administrators.
“I’m sad that it was short, but it’s just been an awesome experience,” Dharm said. “The leadership, staff and campus ministry have been so wonderful. My overall experience has been very positive.”
Dharm, who served as a spiritual leader for the Hindu Student Association, emphasized the importance of developing more programs to meet the needs of the Hindu community at Georgetown, which totals in around 400 students and faculty members.
“They’re just wonderful, wonderful students,” Dharm said. “They’re from different parts of the world and it’s a dream to be at Georgetown. I’ve had very good experiences with them and I wish them all the best. They definitely deserve to have their needs met, especially the spiritual and emotional needs.”
Dharm said she plans to continue to worship God.
“The future is big, and I see God’s presence,” Dharm said. “In the future, I want to take my time to continue to worship God and seek his guidance in my future. I truly wish to worship Him and spend time with Him after my retirement from the military. I wish the Georgetown community and staff all the best in the future.”
Dharm said she hopes that the university community will continue to value the Hindu tradition in her absence.
“I have truly enjoyed the opportunity to support and be part of this important community,” Dharm wrote in an email to the Hindu community. “I pray as I prepare to leave you that you will continue to live out the very pluralistic principles of Sanatan Dharma [an alternative name for Hinduism] at Georgetown.”
Hindu Students Association President Smiti Mohan (MSB ’15) said that Dharm had a strong presence and breadth of knowledge.
“She was a role model and a mentor for a lot of students and they really just liked having someone older that they could talk to about their faith and about other issues,” Mohan said. “She had so much knowledge and experience to share that they really enjoyed and liked.”
According to Mohan, Dharm spent a significant amount of time conversing with students and acting as a religious and intellectual mentor.
“The opportunity to just speak with her was really important to most members because she was so knowledgeable and has had so much experience,” Mohan said. “Every time they had a conversation with her, she would share so much that they would feel very enlightened and feel like they got a lot out of each conversation with her.”
Mohan said that the Hindu community will greatly miss Dharm and all she has done for Hindu students during her chaplaincy.
“We just want her to know that we are still supporting her and we are sending her our best wishes her way, and we hope that everything is okay, but we were all very sad,” Mohan said.
O’Brien ensured the Hindu community that the university would continue to develop the Hindu chaplaincy and confirmed that the university will soon begin a new search process for its next chaplain in the coming months. O’Brien did not comment on the potential for interim resources for the Hindu community during this time period.
The university hired Dharm in October in order to provide Hindu community members with a way to address their spiritual and emotional needs. While serving as chaplain, Dharm provided counseling, Hindu worship services and blessings to her constituents.
“We will soon begin a new search process to identify a worthy successor,” O’Brien wrote. “As before, we will rely on the input and support of our students and alumni to identify and select candidates. It is unlikely that we will be able to complete this process before the end of the academic year, as such professional searches take time.”
O’Brien also recognized the value and importance of the Hindu community at Georgetown in his email.
“I join my colleagues in Campus Ministry in thanking you for your faith-filled presence and service on campus and beyond,” O’Brien wrote. “The Hindu community is a vital part of the interreligious ministry in which we take great pride at Georgetown.”

The Corp will close its three coffee services, Uncommon Grounds, Midnight Mug and More Uncommon Grounds, in a staggered schedule from Jan. 28 to Feb. 1 to accommodate an institution-wide change in coffee vendor and coffee brewing equipment.
Uncommon Grounds will close on Wednesday and Thursday; Midnight Mug will close on Friday and Saturday; and More Uncommon Grounds, which is closed on weekends, will be shut Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
Closing the stores will allow technicians to install new coffee equipment in each store, including brewers, espresso grinders and cleaning equipment. During this time, Students of Georgetown, Inc. will also transition from its current brand of coffee, Mayorga Coffee, to Compass Coffee.
Compass Coffee, according to Moore, will cost five to 10 more cents per cup than Mayorga Coffee, but it will also significantly increase coffee quality.
“This is something that we’ve had to put a lot of work into over the past four months … but it’s something that we’re really excited about because we know that a lot of people want to see even higher-quality coffee products,” Corp COO Patrick Moore (MSB ’15) said.
Compass Coffee, located in the Shaw area in Washington, D.C., opened in late September. The company was created by Michael Haft and Harrison Suarez, two former Marines who became passionate about coffee after meeting at Washington University in St. Louis and serving in Afghanistan together.
Coffee beans from Compass come from Brazil, Guatemala, Indonesia, Kona and Ethiopia, and the vendor offers nine different flavors that include Horizon, which is described on the company’s website as “bright, berry-like and sweet” and Azimuth, which is described as “warm, smoky and intense.”
Since opening just three months ago, the coffee brewery has been covered widely by the press, with a multi-part series in the Washington Post, a feature in chef Martha Stewart’s holiday catalog and a ranking on Thrillist’s list of best coffee shops in D.C. neighborhoods. Compass Coffee is also one of the coffee brands served at Baked and Wired in Georgetown and currently, Uncommon Grounds alum Fahad Abdul (COL ’14) works at the Compass storefront.
The Corp’s partnership with Compass Coffee also includes a change to the brewery’s recommended Curtis and La Marzocco brand machinery, known as the Vulcano. The Corp’s current machinery will be put in storage in case the new equipment malfunctions. Moore declined to comment on the cost of the additional machinery.
During the days the storefronts are closed, the Compass Coffee founders will train over 200 Corp employees on the proper use of the new equipment. Moore said that the equipment will lead to quicker and more efficient coffee brewing.
“Consistency and quality is how we chose the equipment,” Moore said. “We’re hoping that it will also be quicker to serve drinks. The Vulcano enables people to get the espresso ready to go in half the time it normally would have taken. … We’re hoping that will speed up the process of making drinks for our baristas.”
Moore said he expects a significant revenue loss during the days when Corp stores are closed but declined to specify the exact loss. Despite this, Moore said that benefits of this change far outweigh the revenue loss.
“This change in general is very important to us, and we hope that this is important to campus as well,” Moore said. “We’re willing to show that we can take that hit … that being said, we think that this is the plan that will help us make the best possible product moving forward.”
Moore said that he is eager to receive student feedback on the new taste.
“We hope that campus will respond positively,” Moore said. “We’ve tried to stagger our different stores as much as possible, so while we know that there will complications on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. … We hope that people will bear with us as we try to make ourselves better.”
Tori Costa (COL ’18) said that she always orders tea at Corp establishments because she dislikes the coffee’s taste.
“The old coffee was absolutely nasty,” Costa said. “I would go out of my way to not go there, even though usually it’s convenient because they have a lot of locations. … I will definitely start ordering more coffee beverages because usually I just get tea.”
Johnny Jung (COL ’18) said that he thinks that the only way the coffee can improve is if Corp employees are properly trained.
“I feel like it’s not so much the coffee itself; it’s the people who have never used brewing equipment, just tossing grounds into the coffee machine,” Jung said. “I feel like it’s less of an issue of the coffee itself and more the process and training.”

As approximately 500 people gathered for the 16th Annual Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life in Gaston Hall on Saturday, around 20 members of H*yas for Choice, a pro-choice student group unaffiliated with the university, staged an eight-hour protest in Healy Circle.
At last year’s conference, H*yas for Choice protesters were removed from Healy Circle by the Georgetown University Police Department. In September, GUPD mistakenly removed H*yas for Choice protesters from 37th Street during an event in which the university bestowed an honorary degree on Donald Cardinal Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington. At Saturday’s conference, the police did not approach protesters or comment on their presence.
Conference attendees came from colleges and high schools across the country and included faculty, clergy and young professionals from the D.C. area. The conference aimed to focus on the value of human life and encourage pro-life dialogue with lectures such as “Theology of the Body: Building a Culture of Awe and Wonder” and “Mercy and Forgiveness: A Life Issue Even for the Guilty.”
The Conference on Life is unique compared to other conferences that convene in the area during the days leading up to the March for Life, conference co-director Evelyn Flashner (COL ’15) said.
“From our position at a Catholic university, we take as our duty and our pleasure to invite more intellectually rigorous speakers, not necessarily Catholic, who will address these issues not necessarily from an activist perspective but more of a perspective of intelligent debate. That’s always been one of our missions,” Flashner said.
The conference opened with a keynote address by His Eminence Sean Cardinal O’Malley, archbishop of Boston, and ended with a panel discussion titled “The End of Intelligent Debate.” Flashner and the conference board of directors aimed to foster a debate about what Flashner said was a “disturbing” tendency to distort and sensationalize abortion.
“It’s addressing this tendency to shut down debate and use euphemisms and rhetoric to cover up the real issue at hand,” Flashner said regarding the final panel. “To any seriously held belief on abortion, whether pro legalized abortion or against it, I think it’s essential to look at abortion as honestly as possible.”
While the conference went on, H*yas for Choice protestors yelled chants such as, “Racist, sexist, anti-gay — Cardinal O’Connor, go away” and “Pro-life, that’s a lie; you don’t care if women die.”
H*yas for Choice President Abby Grace (SFS ’16) and Vice President Vincent DeLaurentis (SFS ’17) said they want the university to recognize that the Conference on Life is another example of underrepresentation of certain groups within the student body.
“I think the biggest misconception that people have is that we don’t want this conference to happen,” Grace said. “While we definitely disagree with everything being said in the conference, the reason why are protesting and why we continue to express our opinions is because we believes that it is fundamentally unfair that H*yas for Choice is the only viewpoint that is consistently silenced.”
DeLaurentis, who wrote a blog post about the conference, said he was upset about some of the “virulently racist and homophobic” viewpoints held by some of the speakers.
“I think the conference is a slap in the face to a lot of Georgetown students, so while Georgetown can claim that it is a pro-life university solely based on the fact that it’s a Catholic university, so many of the speakers comments go so far beyond that,” DeLaurentis said.
Members of H*yas for Choice posted six opinion pieces on the group’s blog before and after the conference that criticized its motivations. One post addressed Damon Clarke Owens, a speaker at the event, who DeLaurentis said has openly expressed anti-gay and homophobic sentiments on social media.
“I wonder why Owens would be invited to speak at a university-endorsed conference,” DeLaurentis wrote in his post. “How can Georgetown simultaneously justify this speaker while continuing to claim to be progressive on LGBTQ issues? What does the university have to say to queer students whose basic dignity has been challenged by this speaker?”
Grace also wrote a post on H*yas for Choice’s blog criticizing conference speaker Jennifer Lahl, who opposes assistive reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization.
“Writing, ‘Assistive reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization not only involve serious medical risks, they also disrupt family life and commodify human beings.’ Lahl misses the forest for the trees,” Grace wrote in her blog post. “If anything, technologies such as IVF empower individuals to have the family life that they determine is best for them. Just because an individual’s family life fails to perfectly align with Lahl’s conception, it is not any less of a family.”
Flashner responded to the protesting that prefaced the conference, specifically the H*yas for Choice blog posts, by expressing a wish for members of the pro-choice movement to attend the conference in an effort to engage in dialogue.
“I would love for H*yas for Choice to attend our event,” Flashner said. “I’m not in the business of converting any of them to the pro-life position, but I would love to encourage dialogue to inform each other’s positions. I worry when the opposition is entirely devoted to shouting opponents down and disqualifying discourse or debate according to either personal positions or actions of speakers, and I worry that an emphasis only on protest standing outside such a discussion without attempting to enter into discussion at all.”
DeLaurentis called the invitation to attend the conference “disingenuous.”
“The way that I think dialogue should work is that both parties should come to it on equal footing,” DeLaurentis said.“When the pro-life student groups can have the nation’s largest student pro-life conference in Gaston Hall, and I get removed from a public sidewalk by a DPS officer, how can you say that any type of substantive dialogue can go along?”
Flashner said the overall goal of the conference is to have an open, honest forum on pro-life positions.
“I would hope that any attendee from Georgetown’s campus will walk away being more edified, understanding more clearly what it is either that they believe or that they whole heartedly rebel against,” Flashner said. “That’s why we try to invite students of all different perspectives.”
Conference co-director Spencer Crawford (SFS ’16) said that he sees next year’s conference theme focusing on common ground between the pro-life and pro-choice movements.
“I think we share a lot more in common than what we may originally think, so I really want to focus more on the sociological effects of issues concerning the prolife movement,” Crawford said.
Pro-choice supporter Michaela Lewis (COL ’18) attended the panel and expressed her frustration with one-sided conversation.
“The issue I take is with the way the panel was conducted,” Lewis said. “I find hypocrisy in the title, ‘The End of Intelligent Debate,’ in that the panel did not function as a debate as it only told one side of a very divisive issue. There was no opportunity for another viewpoint to be represented. … I don’t know how you can make progress when you are expressing your viewpoint to a group of people who also share it. When there is no dialogue, no one is learning anything.”

A cardinal comes to speak on campus–not just any cardinal–but one of only nine members of a Council of Cardinal Advisors that the Pope has selected to work with him to implement reforms in the Church.  And the Hoya chooses to give the headline not to him but to a group of pro-choice protesters standing outside.  Why am I not surprised?  Also, can someone ask those protesters how in the world Cardinal O’Malley has been “racist”?

Also zero coverage of any Hoyas participating in the March for Life, joinig the MSM with a total coverage blackout.  Unfortunately GU is now reaping the rewards of a 25 year admissions policy that has driven the Catholic student population under 40%, leaving it a campus undistinguished from any secular university and burying its claim as being the pre-eminent Catholic university in the US. Nothing remains of that great Catholic Ivy that was home to a Catholic intellectual tradition.
Today’s students want “diversity”, which means accept what the secular world preaches else you are a racist or a homophobe. There will be no joy for them until every last one of the 200 odd Catholic colleges/universities in the US capitulate and trade in their institutional souls and embrace the secular agenda.  We now ignore Jesus who taught us that “you are not of this world.”

Other Hoya Alum says

Think about the kind of mental issues that go behind spending large amounts of time arguing against Catholic values at a Catholic school you willing chose to attend and for something that is already legal. Think about it.

Burr says 
January 30, 2015 at 5:33 pm
Other Hoya Alum has it right. These people are literally deranged.  There the same sort who write blogs and come up with articles about how to argue with your family at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Think of the psychopathy there.  Instead of enjoying a celebration and relishing the time you have with your family members, you feel obligated to go into battle with them.  That’s the Social Justice Warrior mindset.  Sadly, they do it at GU too.  Fluke openly admitted that one of the reasons she chose the law school was to fight against the birth control ban.  People like this are trolls, and nothing more.  That’s all H*ya’s for Choice is in reality.

Pope Francis will visit Washington, D.C., this fall during his first official visit to the United States as pope.
Francis’ three-city trip of New York City, Philadelphia and Washington marks the first papal visit to the United States since Pope Benedict XVI came in the spring of 2008. During that trip, which was the first papal visit in over 20 years, the former pope visited New York and D.C., celebrating mass at Nationals Park and meeting with President George W. Bush.
Exact details of Pope Francis’ inaugural trip to the District are still not finalized, but he did indicate that he plans to celebrate Mass at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Catholic church in the United States, located in the northeast quadrant of D.C. According to DCist, the pope also plans to canonize Junipero Serra during this mass in honor of his service spreading Christianity to the western United States.
More details of the visit, including the exact dates he will be in D.C., will be announced in the coming months.
At this time, Georgetown has no formal plans regarding his visit, but Georgetown officials noted their excitement for the papal visit.
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said the Georgetown community is looking forward to Pope Francis’ time in D.C.
“We look forward to supporting his visit to the United States and Washington, D.C., this fall,” she said.
Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., said he is excited for students to potentially see the pope in the fall.
“I am very happy for our students that the pope will be coming to Washington so that hopefully they will have a chance to see him during his public appearances,” he said.
Chancellor of the Knights of Columbus Max Rosner (SFS ’18) echoed O’Brien, saying that he plans to take advantage of the visit.
“There was some assumption that he would be coming to D.C. but it was not verified until about two weeks ago, which, living in D.C., is a great opportunity to go to a Mass by the pope, especially this pope,” he said.
He said the Knights of Columbus will plan an official trip to watch a Mass by Pope Francis when final details are announced.
“That’s definitely in the works right now, wherever he’s going to do Mass, it may be the National Basilica or the National Mall, either one, we will 100 percent be taking a van to go see him,” Rosner said.
Rosner added that the organization hopes Pope Francis will stop at Georgetown during his visit.
“We’re in the works of us writing a letter to the Vatican hoping that he can actually come to Georgetown,” he said.
Though Pope Benedict XVI did not visit Georgetown during his trip, and chose to speak at the Catholic University of America, Pope Francis has a closer tie to the Jesuit university, as he is the first pope from the Jesuit order. Originally from Argentina, Pope Francis took over the position of head of the Catholic Church in February 2013 after Pope Benedict XVI became the first pope in centuries to resign his position.
Rosner said he believes Pope Francis’ actions reflect his Jesuit values and closely align with the central values of Georgetown.
“My views are reflective of the whole world’s view that here’s a man that with the church’s recent history of being less focused on action and more with doctrine. Here’s a man that the world sees as a model Christian, and even non-Christians can look to this man as an example,” Rosner said. “Him having this Jesuit message, I actually think it even helps Georgetown more, because he’s reflective of what Georgetown’s message is, which is, let’s actually commit to action and let’s engage with the world.”

Given GU’s recent decision to honor HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at the height of the HHS mandate controversy, I won’t be surprised if the Vatican politely declines any invitation by Georgetown for the Pope to speak on campus.  It would be a shame if GU lost such a great opportunity because of something like that.  But the university really stepped in it with that decision.

James says 
January 28, 2015 at 12:50 am
Luckily, I don’t think they get Fox News over at the Vatican, so they probably have a more subtle and intelligent decision-making metric.

Benjamin says 
August 14, 2015 at 3:00 am
What a bitter, bitter rejoinder. There’s no doubt that Georgetown is a failure of Catholic identity at every level, and no reason to suspect that the Apostolic See did not receive that petition. Georgetown may enjoy an on-the-spot visit as a mercy, but it cannot, in its current state, receive a visit as a merit.

Russ says 
September 2, 2015 at 10:55 am
Our company recently renovated Gaston Stage. We heard many times, from many people, that the Pope was, in fact, coming to GU, and actually speaking on that Stage. Any truth to this? If so, when?
Thanks!

Fifty communities across the United States were selected Jan. 14 as semifinalists from hundreds of applicants to compete for the $5 million Georgetown University Energy Prize.
The communities, which are small cities and towns, will work to lower their individual energy consumptions over the next two years, after which one winner will be chosen in June 2017. All applicants were required to have a population of fewer than 250,000 people, making 70 percent of communities in the United States eligible to apply.
Fifty-three eligible communities were selected as quarterfinalists in August based on basic energy plans. In the subsequent stage, each submitted detailed plans to improve energy efficiency, and semifinalists were selected based on their unique and innovative ideas. The plans were reviewed by a panel of energy efficiency expert volunteers and were asked to incorporate commitments from residential associations, businesses and governmental institutions.
“Every one of the fifty has the whole community involved and has a serious energy plan,” GUEP Executive Director Francis Slakey said.
As the communities execute their plans over the next two years, Slakey, Technical Director John Shore and Project Director Christopher Nelson will be in constant communication with the competing cities, receiving quarterly statistics for electricity and natural gas use.
Based on their energy-saving performances, ten finalists will be selected in January 2017 and will be further judged on sustainability, reproducibility and community engagement in advance of the announcement of a winner later that year.
“The plan had to be something that could be duplicated in cities around the country. The goal here is to find plans that can be replicated by small and mid-size cities in the U.S.,” Slakey said.
Although only one community will win the $5 million prize, the expected five percent annual increase in energy efficiency for each community will allow all competing cities to benefit economically with savings estimated at $10 million.
“The Prize is unique and exciting in several ways. Besides yielding innovative solutions that can be implemented throughout the country, it will result in widespread education within the participating communities and beyond, and it will have valuable benefits to every participating community, not just the winners,” Shore said.
Slakey explained that the idea originated a few years ago at Georgetown.
“We started this a couple years ago with a workshop here on campus where we invited in mayors, city planners and energy efficiency experts,” he said. “We asked them what we could do to help their cities get more engaged in energy efficiency. We decided to have a competition and offer a prize. There is nothing like a little friendly competition to get people really motivated.”
The GUEP directors held an event to announce the opening of the application phase in April 2014.
“Hundreds of cities contacted us which gave us the luxury of setting the filter pretty high about who gets into the competition. All communities needed letters of commitment from their mayor, from all utilities servicing their community and from some prominent community-based organization,” Slakey said.
Although large cities have made substantive strides in energy efficiency, the GUEP aims to identify plans that will work in small to mid-size cities in the U.S.
“There is a lot going on for energy efficiency in big cities in the U.S. like Boston, Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, Chicago and San Francisco. They are doing exemplary work, but their plans don’t really scale to small and mid-size cities in the country,” Slakey said.“If it’s going to work in Fargo, Fairbanks or Houghton County, it’s got to be something that can be slotted in very easily without expectations for additional manpower and resources from the city. That’s what the prize is intended to create.”
Each community plans to lower their energy consumption in different ways. Some competing cities will work with scientists at their local universities to apply the latest concepts in behavior change, while others plan to implement sophisticated ideas in gamification or data analysis to identify what their city’s biggest needs are.
Slakey said he believes that the diversity of approaches that integrate both policy and technology will make the competition both effective and exciting.
“There are 50 cities and 50 different plans. Everybody came up with a completely different approach, which was something that we were hoping for. There are some ideas that are just wildly aggressive and there are others that are a bit more conservative,” he said.
Slakey expects that after two years, tens of millions of tons of carbon will be displaced, an important step forward in energy efficiency.
“Right now in America, we are wasting half the energy that we burn. We are sitting on this vast reservoir of available energy. We have to become just as effective for mining for efficiency as we are for mining coal, natural gas or petroleum,” Slakey said.
Besides the GUEP’s proposed benefits for the competing communities, Shore is confident that the GUEP will also be valuable for the university as it engages with sustainability and energy-efficiency initiatives on campus.
“It will foster cross-disciplinary engagement among the various schools within the university, it will yield data for research, for studying what does and doesn’t work in energy education, and it will engage students in numerous ways, including experiences with community service that help to solve real-world problems,” Shore said.
The Office of the President’s Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara (GRD ’96) echoed Shore, noting the connection of the GUEP to the university’s Jesuit identity.
“We believe that there is a unique potential in hosting a challenge like this in the context of a University — a place committed to learning and experimentation, seeking a deeper understanding of our world, and supporting the well-being of our communities and the common good. This challenge has deep resonance with the mission of this university and its Catholic and Jesuit tradition,” Ferrara said.“The Energy Prize is animated by this tradition and we’re very excited about the new ideas and dialogue it will support — as well as the impact it will have for communities around the world.”

Beginning last Tuesday, the Bioethics Research Library in Healy Hall extended its weekday hours until 9 p.m. on days when it is not hosting an event.
The library’s usual hours, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., will remain intact on nights when the library hosts speakers and panels. The Saturday and Sunday hours of 12 p.m. to 7 p.m. will remain the same.
Kennedy Institute of Ethics Head of Information Services Mark Hakkarinen said that the extended hours will allow students to better use the library.
“I want to do the best thing for Georgetown students [to] maximize the use of this space,” Hakkarinen said. “So this sort of idea of flex hours is a way to address that.”
The library is part of the university’s Kennedy Institute of Ethics and operates as a research and study facility with over 30,000 books, journals and archives.
Hakkarinen said that the library made the change after students expressed a desire to spend more time in the Bioethics Library. The library extends its hours during study days each semester from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekends, and students expressed a desire to spend more study time in the library during the academic year. Last year, Anita Joshi (SFS ’15) created a petition to extend the hours that received 127 votes on IdeaScale.
“I was like, let’s just try this, let’s see how this works,” Hakkarinen said. “So we’ve made a lot longer study hours, including late at night, and [there] was really a great response.”
The library hired two new undergraduate students to staff the extended hours and have used some of their graduate student workers to help ease the transition. In case any problems arise during the extra hours, these students will work with Lauinger staff to resolve them.
“Ultimately, it’s going to be a student-run place in the evenings,” Hakkarinen said. “We also have contacts over in Lauinger Library, such as their evening supervisor, in case there is anything they need help with.”
The new flex hours will be paid for partly by the university and partly by allocating money from the library’s existing budget, Hakkarinen said.
Deputy Director of Reference at the library Martina Darragh said that the first few days produced mixed results.
“On Tuesday, that was the first night, we did have a good crowd up until 7,” Darragh said. “Then from 8 to 9, we didn’t have anybody at all. Now, of course, we’re not in exam time, but we’ll see.”
Hakkarinen said that the library staff will monitor capacity to ensure that the extended hours are an efficient use of resources.
“I think we had 25 people in there per hour [on Tuesday],” Hakkarinen said. “But if there’s one or two people in there, it’s not worth it for Georgetown. I think 30 people would be great per hour.”
One issue that the library faces is a general lack of awareness among students, according to Darragh, who noted that, while they receive a lot of repeat visitors, the amount of new students coming to the library to study has not changed.
“We do have a lot of regulars … coming to study in the library is part of their routine,” Darragh said. “Sometimes our regulars will say, ‘I don’t tell anyone else about this because I don’t want it to be spoiled.’”
Hakkarinen said he wants the flex hours to continue during the spring and fall semesters into the foreseeable future.
“If people are in there, I’ll keep doing it as long as we have money coming in,” Hakkarinen said said. “It’s a really reflective space, I think, and you get a different experience in there.”
Julia Ma (MSB ’15), who works in the library during the day, believes the increase in hours will bring more students to the library.
“Students want to work [at] this facility,” Ma said. “This is a really quiet place to work, it’s really nice, [so] once the word gets out, I’m pretty sure there will be more people.”
Laura Higbee (COL ’15) said she believes that once the flex hours become known, more people will come to study in the library.
“I think a lot of people haven’t discovered the Bioethics Library yet,” she said. “It’s a lot quieter than Lau, it’s a lot prettier than Lau. It’s a gorgeous library.”

The first two Georgetown University Law Center students selected as part of a Department of Defense program visited the military commissions and observed pre-trial hearings at Guantanamo Bay in November and December. Additional student trips are planned for the coming months.
Selected through an application process available only to second-year and third-year law students, as well as Master of Law students, Kayleigh Golish (LAW ’15) attended proceedings from Nov. 3 to Nov. 8, which primarily dealt with pre-trial evidentiary motions related to the impending trial of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, a Saudi Arabian citizen accused of orchestrating the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 before his arrest in 2002.
“The most interesting [motion] to me was that the defense counsel was requesting that the death penalty be taken off the table as a possible punishment for al-Nashiri because of the limitations with accessing classified information,” Golish said. “I thought that was a really interesting conversation that was worth having.”
Shaw Drake (LAW ’15) visited the base from Dec. 14 to Dec. 17 to observe hearings related to the 9/11 case, which includes charges against five members of al-Qaida for orchestrating the deadly attack in New York City and Washington, D.C. While Drake was there, the potential conflict of interest for a lawyer of one of the defendants was dominating the proceedings.
“An FBI investigation targeted one of the members of the defense team,” Drake said. “If your attorney is under investigation by the FBI, that could affect the decisions that they make.”
Another critical motion being considered was the refusal of the defendants to attend meetings with their lawyers because of the presence of women guards in the movement of prisoners.
“The five 9/11 detainees were refusing to go to attorney meetings or court because women were now in positions where they would physically touch them,” Drake said.
After several closed-door sessions with the lawyers that the observers could not view, the judge in the case decided to cancel the hearings, denying Drake the chance to view any proceedings.
“It seems like a calculation was made by the judge: Do we hold the meeting that probably gets us nowhere because the prosecution is not prepared … and in doing so, do we bring beaten up and bloodied defendants into the courtroom because they’ve had to be forcibly removed from their cells and tied down? It’s probably not worth doing that,” Drake said.
The Guantanamo Bay Naval Base was a primary subject in the “torture report” released by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in December, which detailed prisoner abuses used to elicit information and confessions from prisoners at the base. Despite the cancellation of the hearings, Drake explained that the defense counsel met with the observers to discuss some of the issues behind the trial, particularly in relation to the torture discussed in the Senate report.
“[Torture] was a dominating discussion topic … It’s pretty clear that the trial is going to have months and months of arguments around that topic,” Drake said. “The defense team has claimed all along that the way their clients were treated will and should impact the reliability of the evidence and the usage of any statements that they’ve made. They alluded in that conversation that what was released in that report is purely the tip of the iceberg.”
Golish echoed Drake, explaining that the question of torture was ever-present in the Guantanamo commissions.
“Someone who’s been subjected to torture, can they give a voluntary confession?” Golish said. “Every defense counsel is going to try to bring those issues to the forefront and try to use them specifically as mitigating factors.”
Both cases are stuck in the pre-trial stage. According to Drake, the defense counsel in the 9/11 case do not expect a trial until 2017, while the al-Nashiri case is projected by some to start later in 2015, though the defense was pessimistic.
“It’s really quite incredible, not in a good sense, how long it takes, because al-Nashiri is facing charges for events that happened in 2000, before 9/11, and he was arrested in 2002. His trial is starting potentially 13 years later. What does that say for fair and speedy trials?” Golish said.
The observer status conferred upon GULC by the Department of Defense primarily applies to non-governmental organizations, though other universities, including Yale University, Indiana University, Seton Hall University and the University of Toledo, have all sent observers to the proceedings as well. GULC’s Center on National Security and the Law Executive Director Nadia Asancheyev (LAW ’06) said that the law center thought the observer status would provide a platform for students to experience the law in practice.
“We have such a depth of expertise on these issues at Georgetown Law … that we could fulfill the Department of Defense’s mission of having observers go and be able to really do a lot with the information that they gathered,” Asancheyev said. “We just saw a natural opportunity to enhance their learning.”
Asancheyev noted that even as three additional trips were pending for January and February, GULC would continue sending observers as long as the program continued.
“When they have a hearing set, it appears that then they go to the observer pool — and we’re in the observer pool — and ask for nominations for people they want to send,” Asancheyev said. “As long as they are continuing to prosecute people at military commissions at Guantanamo, we intend to send representatives as observers.”
Drake pointed to the program as setting the university in a position to interact with important national issues.
“It puts Georgetown in a unique place to be able to engage with major issues that will make headlines over the next few years, and establishing ourselves as a law school that will send qualified and prepared students to engage actively in this observation project is something that will set Georgetown apart,” Drake said.
Golish reflected on her experience, explaining that viewing the trial had given her a nuanced understanding of the issues surrounding the military commissions. As a member of the Journal of National Security Law and Policy, she explained that the organization was planning a symposium to address issues of terrorism trials and would incorporate her experience into the discussion.
“I think there is a lot of stuff that is still unsettled in terms of rights these people have and whether we’re okay with that. We’re a country that believes in laws and adheres to laws and yet, the laws, as they apply to this set of people, who we’re not crazy about, are not clear,” Golish said. “I also went into these proceedings thinking that they were completely unfair. But after going, you realize that people are trying to achieve justice, but the practices haven’t quite caught up with the law and vice versa. And everything surrounding these commissions is very hazy about where the legal lines really are.”

In light of the recent shooting at the office of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, the Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics hosted “Politics, Comedy and the Dangers of Satire” on Friday, a panel featuring distinguished guests who discussed their experiences regarding satire and its cultural and religious implications.
The event, which was sponsored by the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, Bridges of Understanding and the Office of the President, preceded two performances of “Amrika Chalo,” a satirical play by the Ajoka Theatre of Lahore, at Gonda Theatre on Friday and Saturday.
The panel, which was moderated by Co-Director of the Laboratory and Artistic Director of the Davis Performing Arts Center Derek Goldman, featured award-winning Iranian-Canadian cartoonist Nik Kowsar, British-Canadian writer and filmmaker Zarqa Nawaz, Pakistani playwright Shahid Nadeem and Muslim Chaplain Iman Yayha Hendi.
In his opening remarks, Goldman acknowledged the importance of being sensitive to different cultural contexts in writing comedy.
“I teach a comedy course here at Georgetown’s campus and in that context we explore the deep, serious roots of comedy, as an often dangerous form of social critique,” Goldman said. “We talk about the sources and the social power of laughter, the deep connection between laughter and tears, comedy’s role of exposing hypocrisy in uses of power and also how culturally specific comedy is. What is funny to people in one context may be very serious or deeply offensive in others.”
Kowsar attributed the potential danger of culturally insensitive cartoons to the immediacy of their impact.
“The thing about cartoons is that people understand them in a matter of seconds. You don’t have to read a whole ‘War and Peace’ book in order to understand a cartoon,” Koswar said. “Also, you’ll remember the concept of the cartoon, possibly for your entire life. Cartoons, especially those you can’t read, have a great impact on cultures.”
Kowsar also related his personal experiences in describing the consequences of publishing controversial cartoons. In February 2000, Kowsar was arrested and imprisoned for six days in Tehran for drawing a cartoon that satirized the freedom of expression in Iran, for which he received numerous death threats.
“If they are scared of caricatures and cartoons, I think that they have to look at the caricature that they have created of themselves, the radicals,” Koswar said.
Afterward, the moderator called on Nawaz, who spoke about her experiences as the creator of the world’s first sitcom about a Muslim community living in the West. Her work has de-mystified Islam worldwide by showing how practicing Muslims live their ordinary lives.
“I did a documentary about how many of these traditions are not actually based on religion, but on culture, and many people have mistaken culture for tradition,” Nawaz said. “When my show went on air, conservative Muslims went crazy. What I had forgotten was that I was coming in conflict with the cultural understanding of Islam and also of a different generation. It quickly became evident to me, that even though I, as a practicing Muslim, had no intention of mocking Islam, people were looking through a cultural lens, which was very different from my lens.”
Nadeem, who has been involved in human rights issues in Pakistan since the 1960s, then joined the discussion. He had already been imprisoned by various military regimes and adopted by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience.
“[In] the Muslim society, and in Pakistan, where people crack jokes all the time in their private lives, we believe that we have a great sense of humor,” Nadeem said. “However, when that humor is mixed with reality, it has a lot of political and social undertones. So, it is not just the dictators, the authoritative regimes or the religious forces, but also, people in general, especially when it relates to religion.”
Nadeem said that art provides people with a way to criticize social and political issues without being charged with blasphemy.
“In that context, when you want to address certain issues, you want to shock people; you want to make people realize their own contradictions, conflicts and irrational beliefs,” Nadeem said. “It is very difficult to engage that in dialogue, so you have to use theater, music and art. The only way to get away with it is through humor and satire because otherwise you may be charged with blasphemy which is punishable by death.”
Lastly, Imam Yayha Hendi delivered a speech about how certain images can have the power to either promote or destroy a cause.
“Regardless of whether it is a cartoon, a movie or a document, it is an issue of images,” Hendi said. “I have been suffering with images. People don’t think I look like an imam. I have to prove to people that I am an imam because I look different than the general image of an imam. Images help destroy and promote, and we are at an age in which images can promote peace and help relationships work or not.”
Hendi also condemned the Charlie Hebdo attack by calling it a breach in the freedom of expression.
“Regarding what happened in Paris, I think that the image of Muslims has not helped Muslims at all. I say that France failed to engage Muslims, in an intellectual way, but Muslims also failed to engage Europe and America in a spiritual way,” Hendi said. “At the end of the day, there has to be freedom of expression, people have the right to express themselves. But on the other hand, we can morally censor ourselves, but not through censorship by law.”
Giulia Martins (SFS ’18) said she was very impressed by the event, especially by the remarks made by Zarqa Nawaz.
“The members of the panel were incredible. Each person added their own personal experiences, which were incredibly relevant to the matter being discussed,” Martins said. “I loved Zarqa Nawaz. It is so great to see a strong Muslim woman, who has produced amazing pieces of work, really shine a new light on Islam in the western world.”

Jesuit Heritage Week, the 15th annual university event that celebrates the work and spirituality of the Society of Jesus, began Sunday evening with an opening Mass in Gaston Hall and will continue through Saturday, Jan. 31.
The Office of Mission and Ministry sponsors this event, which happens throughout the final week of January each year and involves a series of special events planned by a student-led team.
“The goal is to share with our students, faculty and staff different aspects of the Jesuit tradition,” Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J. said.“ We have academic events, like lectures; we have social events, spiritual events, artistic events and we have athletic events. They share different aspects of the Jesuit tradition and provide an opportunity for students to get to know Jesuits on campus.”
The week’s events are all centered on the goal of bringing the 40 Jesuits of the Georgetown community closer to the student body while celebrating the university’s Jesuit roots.
As part of the week, Fr. John Foley, S.J., delivered a lecture Monday evening on the Cristo Rey model of education. Foley is the founder of a network of schools that use the Cristo Rey, a new Jesuit education model that partners with local businesses for a work-study format of learning.
Other highlights of the week include a lecture on Jesuit history delivered by world-renowned Jesuit historian Fr. John O’Malley, S.J. on Tuesday night and a basketball shoot-out between students and Jesuits during halftime of Tuesday’s basketball game against Xavier at the Verizon Center.
More events include the annual “Spike-a-Jesuit” volleyball match on Thursday night and Jesuit storytelling on Saturday afternoon. A complete schedule of events can be found on the Mission and Ministry website.
The week’s events were planned and coordinated by a team of eight students headed by two student co-chairs, Nikita Jejurikar (NHS ’15) and John Whitmore (NHS ’16).
“The week is meant to celebrate our heritage as a school and to give students the chance to get to know some Jesuits and kind of understand the values that make us a Jesuit institution and what that means,” Jejurikar said. “It’s mostly a celebration and a learning opportunity.”
Jejurikar also said that while the week is centered on Jesuit spirituality, the events are by no means limited to students of Christian faith.
“The Jesuit values and the Ignatius spirituality and mindset inspires a set of values that are not exclusively Catholic or exclusively Christian,” Jejurikar said. “All the events are Jesuit themed but are relevant to all students. All students are welcomed and encouraged to come.”
In an effort to embrace the different faith traditions represented on campus, a Jesuit will be speaking at a service for each of the religions present on campus during the week.
“We have a Jesuit speaking at each of the religious services, from Jewish Shabbat to Hindu Puja, so we reach students in all different areas,” O’Brien said.
Fr. Joseph Lingan, S.J., rector of the Jesuit community, expressed excitement for the events of the week and noted a growing student interest in Jesuit philosophy.
“It’s always wonderful to have student interest in who we are and what we’re about,” Lingan said. “The reason why we’re here is the students here at Georgetown. It’s our delight to meet and encounter and hopefully help students in whatever way we can. This week really spotlights that for us.”

When the government shut down in 2013, Tom Guthrie (SFS ’15) had a revelation that there are too few young people serving in government.
“I was looking at the TV, looking at the newspapers and there were no young people anywhere,” Guthrie said. “And I started looking at the numbers more broadly, and it’s ridiculous. About 3 percent of state legislators are between 20 and 34 years old. About 1.3 percent before these last elections of Congress were under 40 years old. Those numbers are absurd.”
That revelation led Guthrie to co-found the initiative Youth Voices with Matt Weinmann (SFS ’15), a program aimed at encouraging young people to consider running for office and equipping them with the tools to launch a campaign, in early 2014. Since its founding, Youth Voices has grown to a core team of four people and about a dozen others working on specific projects.
More than 60 students attended Youth Voices’ first event, a day-long conference titled “You Should Run,” which was held in the Intercultural Center on Sunday. The event, put on in collaboration with the McCourt School of Public Policy, featured politicians and those who work in the political arena. Topics of discussion ranged from social media to fundraising to local government.
“The thought is to get a lot of young people who are interested in politics into a room with people who have done this before, who have wisdom to offer them and tell them what it’s like to run for office and hopefully get some people actually running,” Guthrie said.
Eleven speakers attended the event, including four Advisory Neighborhood Commission members who participated in a panel on local government moderated by journalist John Celock.
“People will put you in a box because you’re young,” Ward 8 ANC Commissioner Markus Batchelor said during the panel. “But in my community, regardless of your age, people will value you if you’re knowledgeable and consistent.”
At an earlier talk, Rashawn Davis, the youngest person to ever be certified on the municipal ballot in Newark, N.J. at 21 years old, said, “I kept asking people, ‘How can I, a millennial, run for office and be successful?’ and unequivocally the first step people told me to do was build a team.”
Youth Voices is working with the Rockefeller Center for Public Policy at Dartmouth College to plan a second event, a two-day conference to be held in late March at Dartmouth College. The event already has commitments from some of the biggest young elected officials in New Hampshire, according to Guthrie.
Sunday’s event included students not only from Georgetown University but also George Washington University and American University.
“This [event] gave me so much good info about the details, the things that you wouldn’t know about beforehand, problems you can incur, and things that you should really work on,” American University freshman Andreas Elterich said. “I loved it. I got a lot of good info, and I met some really good people.”
Nick Guthman, also a freshman at American University, said that he was drawn to the event by the professionalism of the event’s marketing and that the conference affected his perception of youth in government.
“What I learned and what I’m going to take away is the power that we have as young people and the power that we have to coalition build and work together,” Guthman said. “I think that the power we hold as youth is really just going to keep getting bigger and bigger. And so I’m really grateful for the opportunity Youth Voices gave to us.”

After smoke filled a Yellow Line train because of electrical arcing on Monday, Jan. 12, city and federal officials have responded with concern about the safety of the Metro and the lack of disclosure provided by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) expressed extreme concern about the incident that occurred and the safety of the Metro moving forward.
“From the initial reports, it seems clear that communication problems between emergency responders and Metro, both underground and above ground, appear to have caused critical delays in rescuing hundreds of passengers from two smoke filled trains that took the life of one passenger and sent 86 others to the hospital,” she said in a press release on Jan. 17.
The timeline, according to the District, included what Congresswoman Norton believed to be a failure in communication between Metro and Emergency Response Services.
Emergency responders received their first call 18 minutes after the incident began. Before that, officials report that they were unaware that an emergency evacuation would be necessary.
“It may well be what prevented the loss of more lives is that it only took Metro one minute to activate the tunnel’s ventilation system, which indicates that Metro understood a serious incident was underway. At the same time, Metro may not have communicated the severity of the situation to emergency officials,” she said.
Several D.C. councilmembers raised concerns about the incident at a press conference held Wednesday.
Councilmember Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1) expressed concern at a briefing held by Chairman Tom Downs on Tuesday. She requested that Downs respond generally to concerns about the safety of the Metro while the official investigation is still going on.
“I’ve heard from a number of constituents who are just feeling scared about whether it’s safe to ride the Metro,” she said.
Council member Kenyan R. McDuffie (D-Ward 5) added that the city has a responsibility to residents and commuters to provide a safe Metro system.
“We are asking people, thousands every day, almost a million in the entire system, to ride Metro. We encourage them to do that,” he said. “At the very least, we could … make sure they have the information that arms them to make an informed decision.”
Tom Downs, chairman of the WMATA board of directors, said WMATA will be investigating the incident and instituting any changes that are necessary.
“No matter what the findings are, whether it shows that Metro did something wrong in this process, we are not going to contest it,” he said. “Whatever they recommend as safety fixes, we are going to put the resources in to make those changes as quickly as they can be made.”
Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) probed Downs about why Metro wouldn’t talk about repairs that must be made in response to last week’s incident.
“Councilmember, I would posit that the facts are actually important before jumping to conclusions about what needs to be fixed,” Downs said.
Although officials have been concerned about lack of disclosure following the Metro incident, closed-door briefings with city and federal lawmakers began Wednesday.
A report on the smoke incident was released last Saturday by D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s office. It shows concerns that have subsequently been mentioned by city and federal officials.
The major concern reported in the document claims firefighters in the tunnel around the L’Enfant Plaza Metro station were unable to communicate well by radio with officials outside the tunnel because signal-boosting equipment was not working correctly. The equipment is under Metro’s control, and the report claims that fire officials told the transit agency about the problem days before the incident.
Passengers were stuck inside train cars full of smoke for at least 35 minutes. Transit experts have said that it was unclear whether the fans, which would have diffused smoke, were working properly during the incident. According to Metro records, 171 fire and smoke incidents have been reported in the Metrorail system in 2013 and the first eight months of 2014.
WMATA released a letter apologizing to its riders last Sunday.
“We apologize to all riders and particularly to the family of Carol Glover and those injured or impacted by the events of Monday afternoon,” Downs wrote. “We know that we have to redouble our efforts to learn from this and take every step necessary to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”
