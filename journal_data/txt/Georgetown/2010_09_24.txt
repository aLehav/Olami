The future of Washington, D.C.’s job market remains uncertain after a positive second fiscal quarter with increased job creation followed by a net loss of jobs in August, according to the District of Columbia’s Department of Employment Services.
Most jobs that had been lost during the recession in D.C. were quickly regained by the end of July. D.C.’s employment rate reached its lowest point in December of 2009 with 12 percent unemployment. The Department of Employment Services estimates that D.C. had a 9.9 percent unemployment rate in the month of July.
MetroMonitor, a project by the Brookings Institute’s Metropolitan Policy Program that tracks America’s economic recovery in metropolitan areas, lists the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area as one of the 20 best-performing cities during the post-recession era. D.C. only had a 1.1 percent loss of employment from the highest point of employment pre-recession to the second quarter of 2010.
In another positive sign of job growth, Monster Employment Index’s number of job postings in the D.C. metropolitan area is 6 percent higher this year than it was last year, according to Executive Gov.
The actual number of employed persons living in the District, 709,900, has gone down by 0.1 percent in the second fiscal quarter of 2010, however.
The fluctuations in the unemployment rate might be due to local government policies, according to the DCist. Statistics point to Mayor Adrian Fenty’s 2010 Summer Youth Employment Program, which employs young adults out of high school, and teaches them skills useful for finding jobs, as the cause for the temporary rise in employment.
After the program ended in August, the number of jobs fell by 26,100, resulting in both a higher unemployment rate and a discrepancy in trends.”

Defeating a measure hotly anticipated by immigration reformers, the U.S. Senate voted Tuesday against closing debate on a bill containing the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, after failing to break a Republican-led filibuster. The result was a disappointment to many cultural and political groups on campus, as well as the university president.
Along with a $726 billion increase in funding for troops in Afghanistan, “don’t ask, don’t tell” and DREAM comprised the National Defense Authorization Act. The bill failed to advance to final consideration following Tuesday’s 56-43 vote.
The vote was based on party lines, with few exceptions. Blanche Lincoln (D-Ariz.), Mark Pryor (D-Ariz.), and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) voted against the bill. Reid’s voting against it allows for the bill to be brought up to vote again.
The DREAM Act, which allows undocumented students to become citizens after receiving their degree, has proved controversial on campus, with student groups and University President John J. DeGioia taking sides on the issue.
“[Undocumented immigrants seeking education] played by our rules, they’ve succeeded by our rules. By everything that we stand for as a people, they should have the opportunity to continue their education in this country,” DeGioia, an advocate of the DREAM Act, said during a teleconference with leaders of higher education and immigrant advocates.
The DREAM Act represented a defining moment in the national fight for both immigration and education reform by offering about 726,000 undocumented students who have lived in the United States prior to age 16 the opportunity to gain permanent citizenship following graduation from a four-year college or two years of military service. Previously, only documented immigrants could gain citizenship through military service.
“[This is] an opportunity for more people to contribute to our country’s prosperity . [and a chance to] stop punishing innocent young people for the accidental circumstances of their birth,” Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in a teleconference on Tuesday.
Obama administration officials praised the act for its ability to help the United States educate its way to a better economy and help the United States become the nation with the highest proportion of college-educated citizens by 2020.
The intensity of national debate has been echoed on the Hilltop.
“[The DREAM Act] is Harry Reid’s military smokescreen for incremental steps toward amnesty [.] rewarding law-breaking aliens with accelerated pathways to citizenship,” College Republicans Chief of Staff Kevin Preskenis (COL ’12) said.
College Democrats advocated for the DREAM Act as early as last spring when the group hosted a student-run forum featuring a panel discussion led by President of the Jesuit Association of Colleges and Universities Rev. Charles Currie, S.J., Georgetown student Juan Gomez (MSB ’11), and United We Dream Network board member Matias Ramos. Speaking from personal experience, Gomez and Ramos discussed the challenges of being undocumented immigrants, while Currie highlighted the key role Jesuit universities play in the fight for social justice in higher education.
The act’s history of bipartisan backing in previous votes left many proponents puzzled about Tuesday’s lack of support. College Democrats President Brian Woll (COL ’12) points to the impending midterm elections as a possible factor, stating that several moderate Republicans may have reversed their votes due to constituent sentiment in their home states.
“Republicans were able to effectively kill the bill without actually taking a stance on the DREAM Act. They essentially hid behind a procedural technicality,” Gomez said.
Woll predicted that Tuesday’s results will only galvanize further student motivation. Before the vote, the College Democrats collected 300 signatures on a petition focusing on the bipartisan nature and narrow focus of the bill. Woll planned to send the petition to the six Georgetown alumni currently serving in the Senate, three of whom are Republicans.
“We gathered 100 signatures in one afternoon of tabling, and 200 more online over the course of one weekend,” said Woll, indicating the high level of support the DREAM Act has here on campus.
While the future of the act is uncertain, Gomez conceded that passing the act on its own is not the most pragmatic option.
“The most natural route would be to attach it to a defense measure, like what just occurred, but that won’t occur until after the [midterm] elections,” Gomez said.”

Joseph Hill (COL ’11) came to Georgetown to study government, but he never could have anticipated how soon he would be actually influencing national politics.
Last Wednesday, Hill testified before the House Committee on the Budget in support of legislation that would extend the Federal Perkins Loan Program an extra year from its October 2012 deadline. Hill personally benefited from the Perkins program.
The program, which was founded in 1958, offers low-interest loans to students with financial need through their respective universities. The loan accounts were established as revolving funds subsidized by both federal and university money and have a 5 percent fixed interest rate. Students owe the universities directly, and institutions use the acquired interest to expand the number of loans available.
The Perkins program is set to end on Oct. 1, 2012, at which time participating universities will begin paying back the federal contributions with interest. Rep. John Spratt (D-S.C.), however, has proposed a one-year extension to the program.
According to Scott Fleming, associate vice president for federal relations at Georgetown, the university was asked to find a student recipient of the Perkins loan who would be willing to testify on the benefits of the program before the House Budget Committee, which is deliberating on Spratt’s proposal. Fleming contacted Patricia McWade, dean of student financial services, who identified and asked candidates to participate.
“I asked [McWade], `Could you see if you could help us identify a student who receives Perkins, and someone who is comfortable talking about their own story and how important it was,'” Fleming said in an interview with THE HOYA. “Joe Hill expressed the willingness to do that.”
Hill’s testimony before the committee highlighted his family’s financial struggles, especially in recent years. His father is a realtor who suffers from myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disorder, and his mother works for the Department of City Health in Philadelphia. Citing a recent relapse in his father’s condition, as well as the lame duck markets faced by realtors, Hill explained to the House committee the importance of the Perkins loan in his ability to attend Georgetown.
“Last week, I was talking to my mother, and, without hesitation, she said, `It still wouldn’t have worked without that Perkins loan,'” he told committee members in the hearing.
According to Hill, the Perkins loan was not the most substantial financial aid that he received – he also had awards from the Urban League, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Georgetown Scholarship Program – but it was instrumental in closing the financial holes spurred by his tuition bill that Georgetown’s tuition costs created.
“I’m not going to say the Perkins loan exclusively [enabled me to attend Georgetown], but without significant support from the university and from Perkins, I wouldn’t have been able to come here,” Hill said. “The gap was just too significant for my parents to cover.”
According to Fleming, Georgetown is in total support of the continuation of the Perkins program, but cited Congressional monetary concerns as the greatest obstacle. Spratt’s extension plan would cost an extra $750 million.
“We are definitely in the camp that we want to see Perkins continue,” Fleming said, “In our dream world, we’d love to have it continue just the way it is. We are also realists. Given the fact that over the last several years, Congress hasn’t even appropriated any capital funds to the program, I am challenged to believe that in this budget situation that somewhere under a rock they’re going to find $750 million.”
According to an article by the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, the Obama administration’s 2011 budget proposal suggested that the Perkins Loan Program be expanded rather than eliminated – extended to all 4,400 colleges across America in a move to grow lending from the federal government and pay off debts. The resolution, however, has not been adopted, though Fleming anticipates it will be part of the Perkins debate going forward.
Hill, meanwhile, will be graduating this year with degrees in government and philosophy. He intends to return to Philadelphia to teach in his home community.
In his final comments to the House committee, Hill petitioned leaders to consider the broader implications of the Perkins program beyond money concerns.
“I understand the daunting nature of our budget woes,” he said, “but the Perkins Loan Program is an investment that has made a huge difference in my life and serves as an affirmation of a core American value: That, in America, you can go as far as diligence and hard work will take you.”

In order to defeat the reigning Patriot League Champions and accomplish something Georgetown has not done in 10 years, the team will need its offensive and defensive leaders to step up. The Hoyas need to stop the Holy Cross passing attack and must have a powerful running and passing game of their own. Georgetown will look for solid play from senior slot receiver Keerome Lawrence, junior running back Chance Logan, junior defensive back Jayah Kaisamba and sophomore defensive back Jeremy Moore.
Keerome Lawrence
Since six of nine touchdowns that opponents have scored on Holy Cross this season have come through the air, Georgetown’s top receiver will be crucial this Saturday. “In my opinion Keerome is one of the best athletes in the Patriot League and our quarterbacks have done a good job of getting him the football,” Head Coach Kevin Kelly said. Lawrence leads the Hoyas with 202 receiving yards this season and has also caught one touchdown pass this season. Lawrence is also coming off his best game of the season last week: Against Yale, he amassed 129 receiving yards and also rushed for a touchdown. Lawrence’s dual ability to run and pass will be especially important this weekend with Holy Cross. “Keerome is very dynamic when he gets the ball and gets into space,” Kelly said.
Chance Logan
Though the Crusaders are especially vulnerable to passing touchdowns, much of the damage done against them has been on the ground. Opponents have averaged 186 rushing yards against Holy Cross, usually using two or even three running backs. So far this year, Logan has been Georgetown’s second featured back, but leads the Hoyas with 5.7 yards per carry. “Chance is a different style runner [than junior Philip Oladeji]. He has a good shake and wiggle and makes guys miss. He is not quite as big but is physical,” Kelly said. Logan started off Georgetown’s scoring against Lafayette with a rushing touchdown, his lone rushing touchdown of the season. The Hoyas will need this type of running production homecoming weekend.
Jayah Kaisamba
When the Crusaders have had offensive success this year, it has been through the air, where they have registered five of their six touchdowns on the season. Kaisamba will be essential to stopping this pass attack. Kaisamba is fourth on the team with 17 tackles and has two interceptions, one of which stopped Lafayette’s last-gap comeback attempt. With about a minute left and the score at 28-24, the Leopards were driving when Kaisamba snatched the ball out of the air and fell to the ground at the three-yard line, sealing the upset win for the Hoyas. Kaisamba’s ballhawking has allowed Georgetown to achieve a great turnover ratio, which has been important to success this season.
“We are leading the league in turnover ratio; we are plus-three in that category,” Kelly said. “The turnover ratio is a huge factor in whether or not we win a game. In the past few years we have been negative, but if we keep in the plus area we have an opportunity to win games.”
Jeremy Moore
oore, who returned a kickoff for a touchdown against Yale last week and earned Patriot League team of the week honors, will also be crucial to Georgetown’s pass defense. The defensive back is tied for second on the team with 18.5 tackles and has compiled a team-high five pass deflections, four of which came against Yale last week.
“He has made a lot of big plays so far this year including in the Yale game,” Kelly said. “They tried to go deep on us a couple of times and he made some very athletic plays for us.”

As the nation prepares for November’s congressional elections, D.C. is also preparing for two other events garnering the country’s attention: The Rally to Restore Sanity and the March to Keep Fear Alive, to be led on the National Mall on Oct. 30 by Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, respectively.
After news broke of the rallies on Sept. 16, they immediately became the top hit on Google, a headliner on The Washington Post website and a frequent topic of conversation among Georgetown students, eager to see if these satirical rallies will break the boundaries between comedy and politics and provide a broader commentary on the current state of American politics.
Many Georgetown students said they were at least thinking about going to the rally, with the majority of that fraction saying they would definitely attend. But students from the Hilltop will just be a few more faces in that crowd – TBD.com estimates around 60,000 attendees. Approval of the event permits has not yet been finalized, but event organizers are in talks with park officials to solidify their spot by the monuments the Saturday before elections.
The satirical rallies mean to call attention to the political radicalism displayed in the media. Stewart explained in his on-air announcement that his rally would give a voice to the people who have not made their presence known through the efforts of the Tea Party and left-leaning groups. Colbert announced his ultra-conservative rally less than an hour later on his own comedy news show, “The Colbert Report.”
While the rallies are not explicitly political in nature, some pundits say they fear the events could have an impact on midterm elections. Geoffrey Bible (SFS ’12), chair of Georgetown University College Republicans, said that he believes the rallies are not anti-Republican or anti-conservative, but rather they highlight the extremism of the liberal left and the Tea Party and thus will not have a large effect on election outcomes.
Vice President of the DC Federation of College Democrats and Campus Outreach Director of GU College Democrats Jake Sticka (COL ’13) agreed with Bible’s assessment.
“The rallies will further the image of the Tea Party as radical and the rallies they’ve been having as a little ridiculous, but they won’t have electoral effects,” Sticka said. Sticka and Bible agreed that the rallies will be taken as what they are: comedy.
“If the rallies do affect the outcome of the election, I’m sort of ashamed,” Bible said with a laugh. “These people aren’t politicians, but comedians.”
According to Bible, satire is a potent tool for stimulating political discussion. William Vogt (SFS ’12), communications director of GU College Democrats, also said that the satirical focus of the rallies is important.
“Satire sends a powerful message. The rallies will just bring focus to some of the issues present in the election, and help people have more informed decisions, because they will have a lot of fun, but then they will think about why they laughed,” Vogt said.
Not everyone sees such a powerful purpose in the rallies, however. Mark Rom, an associate professor in the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, said he doubted the rallies would hold sway over voters.
“[Satire is] totally ineffective,” Rom said. “It goes beyond a lot of people and they just don’t get the joke. It won’t fire people up for action.”
Students said that they appreciate the purpose of the rallies – to take aim at the current political atmosphere. Kevin Preskenis (COL ’12), chief of staff of College Republicans, said that the biggest positive impact of the Tea Party movement is energy, not results.
“They are obviously antiestablishment and focused on taxation frustration. You won’t get too many college students frustrated with taxes,” Preskenis said. “So seeing a jump to people like Colbert and Stewart provides a relief from that dissatisfaction.”
The energy of the Tea Party movement has emerged on some college campuses, however, especially schools in Texas, according to politicsdaily.com. This trend does not hold true for Georgetown, Rom said.
“Georgetown students have always been pretty moderate,” Rom said. “Most don’t come from bomb throwers but rather mainstream Democrats and Republicans. They realize the most extreme people shouldn’t be driving the debate.”
But Georgetown’s perceived centrism does not mean all students are satisfied with the way the country is being run. Both Sticka and Bible find students to be unhappy with the status quo. Rom believes this dissatisfaction is reflective of the recent trends toward radicalism in politics.
“Usually, you think of the youth as being extreme, not seeing the gray and missing the nuances. Now, it is hard for me to see the college kids as the crazy ones,” Rom said.
Preston Mui (COL ’13), president of Hoyas for Liberty, thinks that these rallies come at the right time for students to vocalize their frustrations with current politics. Satire may reinvigorate politics in a way that policy itself cannot.
“Modern politics is broken. The news itself is the joke. Students are probably becoming disillusioned with the state of politics right now, and I think that’s a good thing,” Mui said. “The current affairs of politics deserve to be satirized.”

Georgetown field hockey badly needed a victory Tuesday afternoon to avoid a three-game losing streak. Catherine Shugrue delivered.
The sophomore forward scored two second-half goals, helping the Hoyas (5-3) defeat Robert Morris 3-2 at the field the Blue and Gray call home, American University’s Jacobs Recreational Complex. Fellow sophomore Charlotte Tierney added a goal of her own to seal the victory.
The visiting Colonials (2-6) gave Georgetown a scare early on, as junior Chantele Crow scored the only goal of the half on a breakaway in the 12th minute.
The Hoyas took the lead by capitalizing on Robert Morris mistakes in the second half, as both of Shugrue’s goals came off of penalty corners. Tierney’s goal stretched the lead to 3-1 in the 53rd minute, effectively icing the game despite a late goal by the Colonials’ Ally McGuire.
Sophomore Briana Pereira was solid in goal for Georgetown, making three saves in the winning effort. Senior Annika Bannon and sophomore Sophia Pifer racked up two assists each, and sophomore Annie Wilson had one assist.
Georgetown is off to an impressive start this fall, especially considering the program’s recent history. With Tuesday’s victory – the fifth of the young season – the Hoyas have already eclipsed their win total from the previous three seasons combined. Their success is a ringing endorsement of second-year Head Coach Tiffany Marsh’s first recruiting class, as the top five scorers on the team are all sophomores, led by Shugrue and Tierney.
The Hoyas look to continue their success in nonconference play in North Carolina this weekend. They faceoff against Appalachian State on Saturday at noon and then play Davidson on Sunday at 1 p.m.
Big East conference play begins Oct. 1, at home against Rutgers.”

Even if you’re a regular visitor to Yates Field House, you probably don’t pay any attention to the small walled-off area in the back left of the track and tennis courts, with the sounds of constant loud music and the occasional crashing of weights echoing into the rest of the gym.
In reality, though – and this may be tough for intramural basketball warriors to hear – this is the most important part of Yates, and the most overlooked part of Georgetown’s athletic department.
Staffed by only two full-time university employees, the Georgetown strength and conditioning program is responsible for keeping all of Georgetown’s athletes in top shape.
Despite the small staff and relatively small capacity of the facility, the strength and conditioning coaches have a big job to do to make sure every athlete is healthy and ready to deal with the rigors of long, physically exhausting seasons.
“Every hour, this space is utilized,” Assistant Strength and Conditioning Coach Mike Hill said. “We’re jammed in here every day. . We’re only limited by how many [strength] coaches we have, their time and this space.”
Hill and Carl Johnson are the only two full-time strength coaches, and while they do an exemplary job of scheduling and training roughly 750 student-athletes, none of that would be possible without the assistance they receive in running the weight room from interns coming from schools including George Mason, The George Washington University and American, and from as far away as Johns Hopkins.
“If we didn’t have those college kids coming in for internships . this place wouldn’t survive [with] just two guys in here [managing] 750 athletes,” Hill said.
With the help of those interns and various other part-time staffers, what has to be done gets done, albeit sometimes at an hour that is less than ideal.
“We have all the equipment,” Hill said. “[But] if we had enough coaches, if we had enough space . [we wouldn’t] have to wake the swimming team up at 5:30.”
At the same time, though, Hill realizes that the small footprint of the weight room can have the unintended benefit of fostering a great sense of community and allowing the small staff to give every athlete the personal attention required to maximize his or her physical talents and abilities.
“Programs like LSU and Alabama have the biggest facilities ever,” he said. “But are they really getting any good work in? Are all of the bells and whistles really worth it? I really don’t know.”
Hill is fully aware that the men’s basketball team is the flagship program of Georgetown’s entire athletic operation and takes pride in the fact that it – unlike similarly huge programs at other schools – receives the same level of personal attention as its lesser-publicized brethren.
“There’s not one team in here that we hate training,” Hill said. “We just want to help the university as a whole and [help] the kids get better and help the standards get better. . It’s pretty rewarding whether it’s a tennis, football or basketball guy. Top to bottom I think we treat everyone the same.”
One of the more basic problems that the staff faces, in fact, is getting everyone to the point where they can be treated reasonably the same. With the athletic program’s size and diversity, freshmen arrive at Georgetown with weight training experience that runs the gamut from complete ignorance to deep understanding of all the machines, exercises and the roles they play.
“We get kids who have never lifted before, who haven’t ever been in a weight room before,” Hill said. “We’ve had kids come in and actually had to pull them back a little bit because they know too much.”
Once the schedule and baseline competence are established, the coaches can begin improving their charges’ strength and conditioning. Complicating that particular job, which already varies wildly between off-season conditioning – which focuses primarily on building up strength – and in-season training – which is focused more on increasing endurance and shortening recovery times from game to game – are the breaks when the vast majority of the student body heads home to weeks of relaxation.
“With college kids, their bodies adapt so quickly [that] if you get them in the [weight] room and they’re doing what you put on the card, that’s half the battle right there,” Hill said. “But when they go home for Christmas or the summer . that’s when you lose a whole lot of that [work].”
Beyond the day-to-day management of each team’s and player’s weight training and conditioning programs, the strength and conditioning coaches have a huge role to play in most Hoyas’ rehab process, which is a process made more complicated by the distance between the athletic department’s training staff in McDonough Arena and Hill and Johnson’s Yates location.
“The trainers down [at McDonough] tell us what to do,” Hill said. “We administer [treatment] up here, but we still have to relay it back and forth and there’s always that communication gap.”
That gap is being steadily closed, though, through the hard work of the training and strength staffs, as well as moves by the athletic department such as hiring a personal trainer to work more closely with the Yates staff.
Someday, Hill and his colleagues hope to have a facility for themselves, but for now they toil away in the corner of Yates. That hope may be nothing more than a pipe dream for the coaches, but Hill takes comfort in knowing that they are still accomplishing big things for Georgetown athletics from that little space – and for now, that’ll have to do.”

Candidates vying for seats representing 17 residential districts and at-large spots in the Georgetown University Student Association Senate mobilized their campaigns at midnight Thursday, marking the beginning of an election season that will conclude with voting on Sept. 30.
“Students are primarily concerned with balance. A balance of work and fun, strenuous activities and relaxed ones, and making college as enjoyable as it is challenging. I feel the scope of GUSA’s influence can help students achieve this balance,” said freshman Matthew Morris, a first-time candidate running in the Village C West district.
For some office-seekers, including Morris, the districts are highly specialized.
“My district is comprised of entirely freshmen. As freshmen the people in my district are concerned primarily with starting out on the right foot and finding their niche on campus.” Morris said.
Incumbent candidates emphasized their past experience as GUSA senators to promote their candidacy this semester.
“My experience working on funding reform in the GUSA Senate puts me in a position to continue working for students without spending time to learn the ropes,” Sandy Glassberg (MSB ’11) said.
Joseph Brennan (COL ’12), a candidate for an off-campus seat, emphasized the needs of students living off campus and his personal experience with these issues.
“I live off campus and understand the challenges that off-campus students face. I would love to help GUSA direct more focus toward the issues that the off-campus community cares about, including the lack of on-campus parking, limited bike space, expanding [Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle] service and – most importantly – Metro fare discounts,” he said.
Another off-campus topic of concern for candidates is the tenuous issue of 61-D citations.
“In my district, the off-campus community, I think relations with our non-student neighbors are very important. If re-elected, I would very much like to lessen the severity of punishments for noise violations,” Adam Mortillaro (COL ’12) said. “A 61-D is a little extreme for a loud party.”
Still other candidates have chosen to focus their campaigns on broader issues, such as sophomore Vetone Izevag and her emphasis on environmental issues.
“Although the university and its students have made great progress in the `Go Green’ initiative, I would like to strive toward implementing low-flow faucets in dorms and campus buildings in an effort to transform Georgetown University as a leader in campus environmental sustainability,” Izevag said.
Some of the candidates said they hope to enhance GUSA’s role on campus.
“The GUSA Senate exists in order to voice the needs and desires of the Georgetown student body, and therefore a better relationship between the senate and the students needs to be created,” said Marissa Brogger (SFS ’13), a candidate for an at-large senate seat.
Candidates use a variety of tactics in order to reach their would-be constituents.
Freshman Matthew Chung said he hopes to meet with constituents individually to formulate his platform. “I think that my campaign strategy is just to meet as many people as possible. I will be going door to door all of next week to try to meet with everyone in the district. I want to hear their opinions and their grievances. I think that the personal approach is the most effective way to get your message out,” Chung said.
Freshman Denis Peskov,a candidate in the Village C West district, agreed. “Talking to people is arguably a fairly effective way of reaching out.”
Some candidates hope to reach students through mechanisms such as Facebook groups and posting flyers.
On the other hand, others vying for senate seats have some less traditional campaign tactic ideas.
“I hope to have an open dorm room at some point before the election where people can feel free to come and hang out and everyone can get to know each other,” Morris said.

New York University broke ground on its new Washington, D.C. campus on Monday and plans to welcome its first set of students there by the fall of 2012. Up to 150 students per semester will participate in a special program geared toward students with concentrations in economics, history, journalism and politics.
Located in Foggy Bottom on L Street, just a few blocks from The George Washington University and the White House, NYU’s Constance Milstein and Family Academic Center will serve as a “study away” site that will cater to NYU students from the university’s New York City and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates campuses as they live, study and work in Washington, D.C.
While New York City boasts many internship opportunities for students, the new campus in Washington, D.C., will enable NYU students to participate in more of the political internships open to D.C. students.
While some have compared the satellite campus to a study abroad program, the NYU administration disagrees with the comparison.
“We use the term `study away’ instead of `study abroad’ because it is a better reflection of our current reality,” NYU Vice President of Public Affairs John Beckman wrote in an email. “When you have a university with a presence in so many cities, with a network with two portal campuses – one in NYC and one in Abu Dhabi – and with an academic site now in the [United States], `away’ seems a more apt description.”
Beckman said that political internships would be one of the main appeals of the program for students.
“NYU has an extensive internship program in NYC, but just as our location in NY provides enormous opportunities for internships in media, finance, journalism and cultural settings, among others, our center in Washington will provide opportunities for internships related to the federal government and issues of importance on the national agenda,” Beckman wrote.
NYU students echoed Beckman and said that they are excited about this new possibility of gaining experiences they might not have access to in New York in fields directly related to their majors.
“The mix of the political environment of D.C. and the vibrant culture of New York, especially specific to my major or any journalism or government major, would create a dynamic learning environment,” said NYU freshman Christine Choucair, a major in media, culture and communication.”

Law Center Dean William Treanor issued a memorandum earlier this week explaining the presence of military recruiters on the law campus for its Government Interview Program Sept. 20. The memo was issued Sept. 17, four days before the Tuesday vote in the Senate on the controversial “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.
According to Elissa Free, Law Center executive director of communications, military recruiters have had open access to the law campus since the enactment of a 2003 policy triggered by warnings from the Department of Defense that the university’s federal funds hung in the balance.
Passed by Congress in 1994, the Solomon Amendment mandated that universities re-evaluate military recruitment protocol, as it puts schools at risk of losing federal funding – including research funds – for noncompliance with military recruiting standards.
With these financial factors in play, Free said she did not anticipate a Law Center ban on military interviews in the foreseeable future.
“We don’t expect a change unless there is a change in the federal policy,” Free added.
Before 2003, a 1991 policy had barred military recruiters from interviewing students on the law campus, and the university attempted to strike a balance between the Solomon Amendment and opposition to on-campus military recruiting. The updated protocol, established in 1995, allowed the military to advertise jobs through student mailboxes, but restricted interview access to the main campus. But in 2003, Treanor explained, the Department of Defense took issue with the alterations.
“Over the past several years . the Department of Defense has interpreted the Solomon Amendment to place at risk not simply the federal grant and contract funds of the Law Center, but those of the entire university,” Treanor wrote in the memo.
The resulting decision to permit military interviews on the law campus was reached following discussions among the university’s General Counsel, University President John J. DeGioia, faculty members, senior administrators and students, according to the memorandum.
Though military recruiters now have free reign to recruit on the law campus, Treanor said the Law Center administration maintained its opposition to the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.
“The Law Center has [not] retreated in any way from our strongly held view that gay, lesbian and bisexual students should be able to seek any and every job for which they are qualified,” Treanor said. “It is unfortunate that federal policy does not take the same view.”
Treanor said he is committed to opposing discrimination but asserted that the Law Center is not contesting military service. Georgetown University Law students are welcome to participate in the Georgetown Army ROTC program.
“We can and will, however, make clear our opposition to discrimination through postings and through educational materials. We will support forums for discussion of the federal policy,” Treanor said.
When contacted for comment, the Georgetown Army ROTC recruiting operations officer Richard Hull provided a statement on military recruitment.
“We support programs that open avenues for qualified applicants for our program and the [U.S.] Army,” he said.
Despite recent controversy over the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy- students at other universities are making a push for military recruitment opportunities, notably for ROTC programs currently unavailable at many schools.
Two students from Columbia University are organizing an intercollegiate conference to bring back ROTC programs to campuses that have prohibited them. According to the Yale Daily News, about 10 schools will attend, including Harvard and Brown.”

As reports circulate that one in four women and one in eight men will be victims of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault by the time they leave high school and enter college, the eighth annual “R U Ready?” event to be held next Thursday in Copley Formal Lounge hopes to shed a light on the statistic and its relevance to Georgetown students.
“Two main things come from these stats,” Laura Kovach, director of the Women’s Center, said in an email. “First, that men are assaulted too and we need to support male survivors, and second that the rate of risk for women never changes throughout their lifetime.”
“R U Ready” began in 2003 in an effort to give survivors a voice and to raise awareness about resources, Kovach said.
“R U Ready?’ is a program that raises awareness about sexual assault, relationship violence and stalking on our campus and informs the community about on- and off-campus resources,” Kovach said. “We want participants to walk away with the necessary knowledge to be able to help a friend, classmate, teammate or roommate in the event they are assaulted.”
“R U Ready?” is a campus-wide sponsored event coordinated by Health Education Services, Counseling & Psychological Services, Residence Life, Center for Student Programs and the GU Women’s Center, according to the Women’s Center website.
“Sexual violence affects everyone, so I believe that it is very important to know what to do and how to react when confronted with sexual violence,” Melissa McClure (COL ’13), a facilitator for the event, said. “We are trying to promote understanding and knowledge in the Georgetown community about this very current and important issue.”
One of the most important aspects of the event is allowing the community to know that sexual assault is taken seriously at Georgetown and that there are resources available to students on campus.
“As a community we need to support survivors and hold perpetrators accountable,” Kovach said. “Perpetrator accountability is the key to ending sexual assault, relationship violence and stalking.”
In addition to raising awareness on sexual assault through “R U Ready?” the university’s Department of Public Safety is offering RAD – Rape Aggression Defense – courses to all female faculty, staff and students at no cost.
RAD is a 12-hour physical self-defense course for women that is designed to develop and enhance a woman’s options of self defense by providing information on risk reduction as well as instruction of a number of hands-on techniques, according to the DPS website.
Classes will run throughout October and November, and registration information can be found on the university’s public safety website.
“R U Ready?” will be held at 7 p.m. next Thursday in Copley Formal Lounge.
“The large crowd the event usually draws is evidence that a discourse on both sexual assault and prevention is alive at Georgetown,” Maggie Larkin (COL ’13) said. “Much like the university’s familiar adage, it’s time to join the conversation.”

In the nine months since the institution of the D.C. bag tax, the use of disposable bags has dropped by about 60 percent. While residents were initially skeptical of the effectiveness of the tax, according to The Washington Post, five cents are proving enough of an incentive for customers to forgo plastic bags.
The tax has also reduced the number of bags used by Georgetown students, according to Kaitlyn Fredrick (NHS ’11), director of Vital Vittles.
“I have noticed that customers request substantially fewer bags,” she said.
The bag tax has also encouraged customers to be more environmentally friendly.
“Many customers have begun bringing their own reusable bags or purchasing ones that we sell,” Fredrick said.
The university distributed reusable Grab `n’ Go bags for students at the beginning of the semester and many students are now carrying their own bags.
“We wanted to go green, because last year we were giving bags to every student. Most students bring their bags, very few, only like 10 out of 50, leave their bags in the room. Response has been very positive, because people like the idea of going green,” Grab `n’ Go cashier Jose Arias said.
Not all students are thrilled by the new measures, however.
“I buy less and bring my own bag to the store. I don’t hate the planet, and I reuse my plastic bags, but it’s super inconvenient,” Elizabeth Sinden (COL ’12) said.
ost of the revenue from the five cent tax goes into cleaning the Anacostia River, which has been severely polluted by plastic bags. One cent goes to the retailers, two cents if they offer rebate for bringing their own bags, and the remainder goes to alleviate the heavy pollution of Anacostia River, where about 20 percent of the waste is plastic bags.
Through the end of July, the city collected about $1.1 million in revenue from the tax. The projected goal for the year was $3.6 million.
