While the D.C. Consortium has been in existence for 44 years, the academic exchange program remains limited mostly to graduate students within the city, with few Georgetown undergraduates taking advantage of the opportunity to take classes at other area universities.
The Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area allows students from 12 universities and two colleges to cross-register for courses at all member institutions. The number of students taking advantage of the Consortium is generally equal at all District universities, according to Zach Swartz, assistant registrar and consortium coordinator at Georgetown.
Most Georgetown students choose to study at The George Washington University, American University and the University of Maryland. Seventy-three Georgetown students are enrolled in Consortium courses this fall. There have been 470 cross-registrations – the number of courses students have registered in, but not necessarily the total number of participants, as multiple students can register for the same course – since the fall of 2008, according to Swartz.
But registration at Georgetown is limited mainly to graduate students, and the primary purpose of the Consortium is to serve these students, Swartz said.
The most popular Consortium courses for Georgetown graduate students are in government, public policy, the masters in business program and linguistics, but the same is not true for undergraduates. Undergraduate cross-registrations are usually in military science, a requirement for ROTC members. Other requests are for foreign language classes not offered at Georgetown, such as sign language at Gallaudet University. But undergraduates have a difficult path to cross-registration, Swartz said.
“While undergraduate students are allowed to participate, it’s generally only permitted for juniors and seniors requesting courses that aren’t available at GU and which are determined by the student’s dean to fall into an appropriate `area of enrichment,'” he wrote in an email.
Furthermore, students are often rejected because Consortium registration occurs after courses are already closed at other schools.
“Consortium registration doesn’t take place until on or near the first day of class at most participating schools so that students are provided registration priority at their home institutions,” Swartz said. “This can result in a long wait for enrollment confirmation and frustration for students who request courses that close before Consortium registration occurs.”
Despite Swartz’s concerns, students who have taken courses at other schools did not seem to face much difficulty in navigating the process.
“It was actually an incredibly simple process – Georgetown makes it very easy for you to take Consortium classes,” Kathleen Mulvaney (COL ’11), who is currently enrolled in a Swahili course at Howard University, said in an email.
ulvaney said that because Georgetown did not offer Swahili beyond the beginner level, she wanted to explore her options at other universities. She contacted the head of the Swahili department at Howard and received a course recommendation, which she then presented to her dean. After receiving approval from Swartz, she was able to start taking the course at Howard.
Parts of the process remain unclear, however, namely transferring credits for the Consortium course.
“When I spoke with my dean at the beginning of the semester I was told that the courses would transfer and that I would receive credit for the course,” Mulvaney said. “However, one piece of information that I still am unaware of and that I would like to know is if my grade at Howard will go toward my GPA at Georgetown or if it will remain separate on my transcript.”
ulvaney said that on the whole the Consortium process had been a positive experience, as it had allowed her to explore education beyond the Hilltop.
“As far as Howard University staff and curriculum goes, I couldn’t be happier with my decision to take a course there,” she said. “For me, it has been a great experience in that it has given me the opportunity to get outside of Georgetown and meet new people.”
Students across D.C. take advantage of the program, with many students also coming to Georgetown to take classes. Mulvaney said that there are several Consortium students in her African politics and government class. According to Swartz, the primary areas of interest for students coming to the Hilltop are security studies, masters in foreign service, international affairs, government, public policy and MBA classes. The exchange between graduate classes is beneficial to all students, according to Elizabeth Griffith, an associate dean of the MBA evening program, which services both Georgetown and Consortium students.
“When a Georgetown student can take advantage of another institution’s offerings, this is really a triple win – a win for Georgetown as an institution, because we can continue to focus on offering the particular courses we are most equipped to offer, a win for the students, who can supplement their Georgetown experience to meet their unique needs, and a win for other area institutions, who can offer their own unique expertise and share this expertise with a wider audience,” Griffith said in an email.

The Georgetown University Student Association Senate voted in new staff and leadership members Monday evening, electing Adam Mortillaro (COL ’12) as the senate speaker for this academic year.
Mortillaro won by a significant margin against fellow senators Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) and Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13). Mortillaro received 13 votes, Malkerson received three and Gustafson received two.
In his pre-election speech, Mortillaro said, “It’s really been impressed upon me that there is a great deal of talent in this year’s body. There are many pressing issues, and I think the senate really owes these issues our full attention. We should adopt a process of efficiency and efficacy.”
The new speaker said that much emphasis was placed on the Finance and Appropriations Committee last year because of funding reform passed by the senate, perhaps at the expense of coordination between committees.
“There wasn’t as much communication as there could have been between the guys who hold the purse strings and everyone else,” Mortillaro said. “This year we want to create a climate of greater collaboration.”
He went on to underline the need to foster ties among the various GUSA committees: Housing Facilities and Technology, Finance and Appropriations, Community Building and Outreach, Academic Affairs and Student Life.
“If we create a system of openness between committees I think we can be, as a whole, more effective,” he said.
ortillaro also discussed other issues confronting the senate. One such issue is funding for the weekend Georgetown University Transportation Service buses, which depleted last spring.
GUSA President Calen Angert (MSB ’11), however, said that a solution for GUTS bus funding is on the horizon. “We are taking care of it. The contracts are in the process of being signed and the funds are pledged from a variety of sources,” he said.
ortillaro cited student engagement as another issue facing the senate. He voiced concerns over low voter turnout, and expressed hope that strategies like voting booths in Red Square – which, when implemented in 2001, yielded turnout of over 50 percent – might help students to feel more invested in GUSA.
Former Senate Speaker Adam Talbot (COL ’12) commented on the challenges he faced during his own term last academic year.
“Our challenge last year was to build the senate into a stronger institution with a real reason for being,” Talbot said. “As speaker I focused the senate on reforming the way that club funding works on campus and on bringing the student association to more of the campus community.”
The senate body also elected Ben Bold (COL ’13) to serve as GUSA’s vice speaker. According to fellow senator and interim speaker Chris Pigott (COL ’12), “[Ben] will be a great complement to Adam and will get stuff done.”
Heading this year’s Finance and Appropriations Committee is Gregory Laverriere (COL ’12). The six senators elected to participate in this year’s Finance and Appropriations Committee are Malkerson, Pigott, Tyler Sax (COL ’13), Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), Sandy Glassberg (MSB ’11) and Sheila Walsh (COL ’14).

Two Georgetown alumni are seeking to turn innovative new ideas into feasible small businesses through the Compass Partners Fellowship, a program that provides resources and training to aspiring undergraduate entrepreneurs. While the program has 75 new fellows this year, 15 at Georgetown, it still faces the same problem as other startup organizations.
“[Compass Partners has faced the problems] that any startup organization has faced. There’s a lot of ups and downs, and a lot of uncertainty. We’re really lucky to have the supporters and community we do. It’s always great to get advice from those much smarter than we are,” Neil Shah (MSB ’10), one of the founders of Compass Partners, said in an email.
Shah said that none of the sponsors that originally joined the group have left, and that the plan is for the partners to be self-sufficient by fall 2011. The success is especially significant because of the problems the founders had in starting their own companies and how they are now applying their experience to help others start social businesses.
During their freshman year on the Hilltop, Shah and Arthur Woods (MSB ’10) each tried their hand at starting small businesses. Shah pioneered a free-trade tea company while Woods aspired to create a delivery service that would make farmers market produce available to students.
Despite the altruistic aims underlying both endeavors, their businesses ultimately failed due to a lack of support, knowledge and resources. Armed with their mutual belief in business as a mechanism for social change and passion for entrepreneurship, the pair founded Compass Partners in 2009 to ensure other projects would not suffer the same fate.
The mentor teams work with groups of 15 fellows who spend two years developing their ideas, gathering capital and eventually launching their business. Although there are a variety of organizations committed to helping high schoolers and 20-somethings start small businesses, Shah said that by focusing on a niche market of college underclassmen, Compass Partners is able to relate and adapt to the specific needs and expectations of its fellows.
“We have an advantage by being students ourselves – we understand what we need,”
Shah said. “For example, if a fellow tells us they’re not covering sales in their business school classes, we can adjust our curriculum or change speakers to accommodate that.”
The fluidity of the curriculum is one of the distinguishing characteristics of Compass Partners and allows students to add practical experience to the theoretical knowledge they acquire in the classroom.
“[Compass Partners] was great because it was really just engaging and learning from doing and learning from people who had been there and seen everything and who had the experience, and it was more than just reading out of a textbook,” Tom Zorc (MSB ’13), a former fellow and current mentor, said.
Over the past several semesters, Compass Partners has led to numerous successful student-run businesses founded by Georgetown students. Today, Angela Morabito (SFS ’13) will be debuting her clothing line, Headlines: SmartWear, which she developed during her time as a fellow last year.
One of the main ideas the founders want to instill in their fellows is the idea of social business or, as Woods puts it, “using business for the greater good.” He and Shah said that rather than simply giving back through charitable donations, businesses should strive to implement a permanent social aspect into their framework. To be considered for a Compass Partners fellowship, applicants must present a business model that is operationally possible, financially sustainable and socially beneficial.
“What I love about Compass is that it completely changed my understanding of value. How a business can have a mission that’s not just `Let us get the [greatest profit] possible,’ but `Let us get as much profit as possible while still trying to significantly benefit the community in which we work,'” fellow Alex Honjiyo (SFS ’13) said.

Rapper Lupe Fiasco will perform Oct. 30 outside of McDonough Arena, marking a revitalization of Georgetown’s fall concert, which has been on hiatus since 2007.
Sponsored by the Senior Class Committee and Georgetown Program Board with funding from What’s After Dark and The Corp, doors will open for the event at 8:30 p.m., with Lupe Fiasco performing from 9:30 p.m. to midnight. Tickets will be sold in Red Square and online for $25 before the concert and for $30 at the door.
Andrew Malzberg (COL ’11), chairman of the board of the SCC, said the SCC has been working diligently to bring back the fall concert from its three-year lull since Coolio performed in the fall of 2007.
“As a board we decided at our retreat that we wanted to plan a concert in the fall . for the seniors and the greater Georgetown community. We wanted this to be an initiative for something that Georgetown doesn’t have a lot of,” Malzberg said.
alzberg estimates 4,000 tickets will be sold for the concert, which is open to students from other universities for a price of $30 per ticket.
According to Malzberg, the setup, including the lights, stage and sound system, has been booked through National Audio, a private company. The opening act for Lupe Fiasco is currently undisclosed.
When choosing the artist for this year’s fall concert, event organizers considered artist availability for the time period, consulted the results of a GPB survey last spring that polled the student body for their preferred musical acts, and then searched for the best artist that fit their budget. Luckily, Malzberg said, Lupe Fiasco accepted the first bid for the concert.
Tom Lipinsky (MSB ’11), chair of The Corp Philanthropy Committee, which grants external funding requests, said he was excited The Corp was able to sponsor a start-up event such as the fall concert, which lacks university support.
Though The Corp’s contribution of $2,000 is substantial, Lipinsky said the committee felt the end result would be worth it. “It’s on the large size of contributions we make, but we thought this was something that could add to the entire Georgetown experience,” he said.
“The board definitely hopes [the fall concert] is an initiative that is continued for the student body because a lot of universities have two concerts a year, and it would be great to see it continue here,” Malzberg said.
Students were excited to hear that there will be a fall concert this year.
“I’m really excited and proud of the SCC,” Lipinsky said.
“I will definitely be attending, and I’m so excited that we can bring an artist like Lupe Fiasco to Georgetown,” Dan Mathis (SFS ’13) said.”

Jessica Pérez’s high school guidance counselor told her not to bother applying to Georgetown because it would be too hard. From her freshman year in high school, the odds were stacked against her – most of the faces she saw in the hallways would not even make it to graduation. Pérez was one of the few to beat the odds.
 
Pérez (COL ’13) graduated from Garey Senior High, a public school located in a low-income area 30 miles east of Los Angeles. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University listed it as one of America’s 1,700 “Dropout Factories,” a title reserved for high schools in which less than 60 percent of the students who start as freshmen make it to their senior year. This distinction applies to more than one in 10 high schools across America, according to the Associated Press. For David Guggenheim, this is one in 10 too many.
 
 
 
Guggenheim’s documentary “Waiting for `Superman,'” now playing in select theaters, has sparked a discourse on the need for education reform in the United States, an issue that hits close to home for a handful of Georgetown students.
 
 
 
The documentary examines the story of five families struggling to ensure a better education for their children. These five children represented the thousands of faces of students, like Pérez, who grow up in areas with low-performing schools.
 
 
 
“My high school was classified as an improvement school with only a [47] percent retention rate,” Pérez said. “There was no support coming from my high school. Like these students [in the film], I had the support I need at home. Yet, what about those people who have no support system at home? Why should others be cheated of a college education?”
 
 
 
The U.S. Department of Education’s recent study reports that in 2008, about 28 percent of high school graduates from high-poverty schools attended a four-year institution after graduation, compared with 52 percent of high school graduates from low-poverty schools.
 
 
 
Justin Pinn (COL ’13) explained that the standards set at his public high school in Springfield, Ohio, were low and, like in the film, students were placed on tracks based on prior performance and perceived ability.
 
 
 
“In my state, about 40 percent is what you need to pass the [Ohio Graduation Test] in math and science,” Pinn said. “That just shows where our standards were. In middle school, most people were passed on, but when they got to high school, credits and passing mattered . most people got stuck on that bridge to nowhere.”
 
 
 
Pinn said that while his school did offer a partnership with a joint vocational school, it was not emphasized enough and was touted as a route for “nobodys.”
 
 
 
“I don’t believe college is right for everyone, but I saw the door shut on a lot of people. They just sat in the back of the class and faded into the background until it was too late, just because they weren’t deemed college material,” Pinn said.
 
 
 
Even for Pinn, the low standards set him behind.
 
 
 
“In my high school I was the top of the top, but when you put me on a national level I was way behind. . [The school] kept the bar so low,” Pinn said.
 
 
 
“I believe our school’s standards were low because the teachers found themselves teaching to a test and not to the individual needs of students, which only needed you to pass a very minimal amount of material. However, there were a select few teachers that did go beyond the call of duty – and I owe my being [at Georgetown] to them.”
 
 
 
The low standards set by many inner-city public schools are a concern for many students whom statistics predict will not graduate.
 
 
 
One of the film’s trailers presents striking statistics of the 1.2 million students that drop out of high school each year: “These dropouts are eight times more likely to go to prison, 50 percent less likely to vote, more likely to need social welfare assistance, not eligible for 90 percent of jobs, are being paid 40 cents to the dollar of earned by a college graduate, and continuing the cycle of poverty.”
 
 
 
These statistics, along with personal experience in the public school system, are creating a discourse at Georgetown for a nationwide education reform.
 
 
 
According to Pérez, an education reform is necessary because it is unfair that students who try to get a good education cannot because of the school’s lack of resources.
 
 
 
“In California we have recently had so many budget cuts that a third of all the teachers in my school district were let go,” Pérez said, adding that a boost in funding must be the first step in improving schools. “Education is key in this country and yet more money is going into the prison system.”
 
 
 
Pérez also said that it’s time for a switch in the barometer that often measures student success. “Test scores are not everything. You cannot just judge how a student is doing based on a number. We need to makes these improvements and eventually all of our high schools can compare to these magnet schools. Our education should not be placed on a lottery.”
 
 
 
Philip Bachas-Daunert (COL ’13) attended Paul Laurence Dunbar, a public high school in Lexington, Ky., that he described as being in the upper-class part of town. Through this experience, he could see firsthand the inequalities in resources between his school and other high schools in the city.
 
 
 
“The teachers are in the places where the kids will mostly likely succeed,” Bachas-Daunert said. “I went to the best high school in the area . the other high school in a lower income area got the worst teachers and the worse facilities. The kids who really need the help don’t get the help that they deserve.”
This sort of neglect may put students at a disadvantage, but Georgetown has made an effort to compensate for the failures of public high schools. The university actively works to expose children from lower-income areas to the university, as well as to recruit student applications.
 
 
 
In the 2009 Diversity Initiative report on Admissions and Recruitment, the working group observed that Georgetown’s recruitment success has had a direct correlation to the prosperity of the university.
 
 
 
“We came to see that, overall, Georgetown has developed one of the nation’s most successful programs of student recruitment and selection,” the report read. “Perhaps no sustained achievement has been more central to Georgetown’s standing as a top-25 research university.”
 
 
 
The university accepted the admissions working group’s recommendations last spring and has since been working to institute them, such as the creation of an Advisory Group to the Dean of Undergraduate Admissions, composed of students, faculty and staff.
 
 
 
Next week, the university will welcome students from D.C. public high schools for “College Awareness Week,” a college exposure event which will provide the ninth grade visitors with several on-campus activities including a campus tour by a Blue & Gray Tour Guide. Cameron Williams (COL ’11), president of Blue & Gray, said that student volunteers have responded favorably to the event.
 
 
 
“We have a lot of students who are excited about the visit, and a lot of [tour guide] volunteers,” she said.
 
 
 
University officials have backed initiatives like “College Awareness Week” as numbers for minority and need-based admittances have dropped off in recent years. The Georgetown Scholarship Program and the 1789 Imperative especially have sought to provide a significant amount of financial aid to students in the future.”

Following the defeat of Mayor Adrian Fenty in the Democratic primaries of the D.C. mayoral elections, there will be a change in the D.C. public schools system: Chancellor Michelle Rhee is stepping down later in October, ending weeks of controversy, and will be replaced by Georgetown alumna Kaya Henderson (SFS ’92).
Rhee officially announced her resignation on Wednesday. At the press conference, mayoral candidate Vincent Gray, standing with Fenty and Henderson, announced Henderson as Rhee’s replacement.
Henderson will serve as interim chancellor, until January when Gray will take office, should he win the general election and officially appoint her to the position as expected.
Prior to her appointment, Henderson served under Rhee as deputy chancellor. The two have many of the same goals when it comes to education reform, namely that poverty should not affect academic performance, according to The Washington Post.
Henderson attended Georgetown University, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service and a Master of Arts in leadership. Before her appointment as deputy chancellor, Henderson was involved in several different programs to foster academic reform. She began as a member of the Teach for America corps, teaching Spanish to middle school students. Over time, she served as a recruiter, the national director of admissions, and finally the executive director for Teach for America D.C.
During Henderson’s time at Teach for America, the number of Georgetown alumni working for Teach for America reached record levels, according to Georgetown Alumni Online.
Henderson then went on to join The New Teacher Project, where she served as vice president and launched the D.C. Teaching Fellows Program. The program was just one of several alternative certification programs founded by Henderson.
Rhee had participated in both the Teach for America program and The New Teacher Project as well. When she became chancellor, Henderson was Rhee’s first appointment. Rhee described her as a critical and innovative thinker.
“She’s everything you’d want in a leader,” Rhee said on the day of Henderson’s appointment.
During a news conference after the announcement was made, Henderson told reporters, “I’m excited about where we are, and I’m thrilled that the management team has agreed to stay on to continue this process.”
Nathaniel Roloff, director of Georgetown University’s DC Reads, a tutoring program for D.C. public schools, confirmed that sentiment.
“It takes moxie to be a leader that does unpopular things, but we have every reason to believe that Kaya has what it takes to do what she feels is right despite a lack of popularity. I believe that her current relationship to Vincent Gray [the presumptive mayor] will be good for the schools,” Roloff wrote in an email. “Her appointment suggests that similar reform will be in place, Gray will listen and advise rather than micromanage, and the reforms that earned D.C. the Race to the Top funds will continue.”
Former chancellor Rhee has been the focus of both acclaim and criticism for her strong approach to reform, closing 20 schools within her first year in office and replacing many administrators. The reforms made D.C. a winner in the Race to the Top, a grant program for struggling schools set up by the Obama administration, but also alienated many teachers. According to Roloff, Rhee did not have a choice except to be tough.
“The chancellor, instead of hiding from it, embraced [the reality of a test score- driven culture] and made it possible to build schools from on top of the test score regime, rather than crumble beneath it,” Roloff said.
Roloff also said that he does not necessarily agree with some of her proposed changes or actions and that Henderson seems to want to follow Rhee’s vision. While serving as deputy chancellor in 2008, Henderson was instrumental in the controversial firing of 98 members of the central staff, according to The Washington Post.

A Metro stop in Georgetown may still be a pipe dream, but D.C. officials now have concrete plans to build something comparable: a line of electric streetcars with a stop on the Georgetown waterfront. The streetcars should be up and running within the next five to 10 years.
The line will run from eastern D.C. past Union Station to the intersection of K Street and Wisconsin Avenue.`Georgetown’s line is only part of a complex planned streetcar network that will stretch across the city.
“Streetcars are a permanent investment and as a result can spark economic development and revitalization along the corridors they serve,” John Lisle, a spokesman for the District Department of Transportation, wrote in an email. “They will also help connect neighborhoods within the District and provide better transportation options in areas that are underserved by Metrorail.”
The DDOT has already started constructing the eastern end of the line that will eventually run to Georgetown and another line in Anacostia. Lisle predicted that the first streetcars would begin carrying passengers in 2012.
Bill Starrels, vice chairman of the Georgetown Advisory Neighborhood Commission whose district includes the planned Georgetown streetcar stop, welcomes the addition to the neighborhood.
“The one negative of Georgetown now is not having the Metro. The circulator’s helped to a degree, but I think streetcars would really help address that,” Starrels said.
Starrels said that the new lines should fit in with the character of the neighborhood.
“The main concern from a negative standpoint is the overhead wires . ,” he said. “The city itself has a lot of historical rules on why wires need to be buried underground, and that’s been one of the stumbling blocks up to now.”
Lisle, though, said he wasn’t worried about the fate of the project.
“There is tremendous support for streetcars in the District,” he said, “and as we move forward we will be working very closely with the various communities to ensure their concerns and preferences are given full weight.”

In a letter-writing campaign held at the Black House Monday evening, participants responded to a string of diversity-related issues that have arisen on campus this academic year.
Monday’s initiative was coordinated by Candace Carrington (COL ’12), Ross Anderson (COL ’11), Liani Balasuriya (COL ’11) and Taelor Conley (COL ’12), all students living in the Black House, which is a residential space and forum for black and other minority students to socialize and discuss salient issues. Participants were instructed to bring a laptop in order to write email messages to professors and engage the broader campus community.
The letter-writing campaign came in response to the “possible noose” university officials said was found in a locked utility area below Healy Hall several weeks ago, as well as recent racist graffiti in and adjacent to the Healy sub-basement that has been reported by the university. These incidents sparked a campus community meeting held on Sept. 30 with members from the Department of Public Safety, Student Affairs and Campus Ministry.
Although the “possible noose” was later deemed a climbing rope by administrators, turnout at the initial meeting was low, and student organizers said not enough has been done to mobilize the campus community behind issues of race relations.
“We wanted to use this [instance] to be proactive about events before there’s an actual noose,” Carrington said.
Balasuriya, resident director of the Black House, said she was disappointed by student reaction to the incident.
“We were appreciative of the meeting that the university held, yet it was scary how numb the student response was,” she said.
Balasuriya explained that the letter-writing campaign would be best targeted at professors due to their unique range of influence.
“[Professors] can reach everyone. If we can get them to think about it at a department-wide level, then we can try and push the conversation to new spaces.”
Balasuriya said she did not see a lackluster student response as representative of the entire campus, however. “The problem isn’t specific to the university, but we’re asking for a solution that’s specific to the university and that is to mandate this conversation with the strategy on how do we make this a priority for everyone,” she said. “Hopefully we can all join forces to strengthen our community both inside and outside the classroom, and I think reaching out to professors is one way to do that.”
Balasuriya added that the Black House’s campaign was not meant to criticize any portions of campus. “This is not a letter campaign `against’ anything. It’s a campaign for increased coordination among all those who work on behalf of diversity – and to expand this group – because we cannot accept the response of numbness.”
More than 45 students dropped by to assist with the task during the event’s two-hour span.
The group accomplished their goal for the night, which was to send out an email to everyone in the faculty directory, tallying about 2,400 names. Volunteers gathered around pizza and
discussed shared concerns.
Campus apathy was a central issue addressed in the email to the professors. Although some professors have regularly attended events addressing the bias-related incidents on campus, some letter writers said they were concerned too small a group of professors regularly took part. Many of the participants expressed hope that with the help of this email, more professors would get involved after hearing the personal perspectives of students.
Alex Silberman (COL ’11) has already had favorable responses from some professors that he emailed. “We contacted over 2,000 faculty members, and I’ve personally received two or three responses from professors who want to continue the conversation in their classrooms with their students,” he said.
“Conversation’s a nice step to generate action, but what direction it goes in is what matters the most,” participant Eric Reed (COL ’11) said.

Brought together by the call of service, a diverse group of student groups are banding together to help others through an annual event called “25 Days of Service.”
The event, ongoing for the first 25 days of October and organized by the Patrick Healy Fellows Program, coordinates various service events each involving two student groups that normally would not be working together. It is the largest service collaboration at Georgetown.
“It’s a unique way for Georgetown students to meet other students who they otherwise would never see,” said Ryan Wilson (COL ’12), a Patrick Healy Fellow and co-coordinator of the event. “Our hope is that even after the project is over they will collaborate on other events and become friends with people they didn’t know.”
25 Days of Service was started five years ago in an effort to promote tolerance and collaboration.
“That was the inspiration for this idea of collaboration among student groups on campus,” said Hannah Kang (SFS ’12), another Patrick Healy Fellow and co-coordinator of the event.
Clubs interested in being involved attended an interest meeting in September at which they were paired with another club and selected on a service project. Each partnership was given $40 of funding for their project. This year the Korean Students Association and the Caribbean Culture Circle are working together to make goodie bags to distribute at a local children’s hospital, among other projects.
“It’s always really gratifying to see really opposite organizations who have absolutely nothing to do with each other come together to do something for the D.C. community. I’ve seen a lot of really constructive relationships come out of it,” Kang said.
“It’s a nice way to meet new and different people and do something community service-oriented,” said Laurel Zigarelli (SFS ’14), who participated in a joint project run by Georgetown University College Republicans and Hoyas for Troops. Members of the two groups wrote letters to American troops overseas expressing their support.
“It was awesome. . I was able to give back in a way I hope someone will appreciate,” Zigarelli said. “I hope everyone gets a chance to give back in a little way and get involved in one of the events.”
Both Wilson and Kang believe that 25 Days of Service is a crucial part of the university’s commitment to tolerance and diversity, a mission realized through unexpected student group pairings on projects.
“It’s one thing to talk about diversity, but it’s another to actually practice it,” Kang said. “In light of the recent debates we’ve had on campus about diversity, I think 25 Days puts diversity in action. It means getting people involved through their clubs to work with other organizations they’ve never worked with before.”
Kang added that these acts of service play a crucial role in the campus climate, “Without that kind of
action, diversity can only mean so much.”

Last week, the White House announced it would be adding solar panels to its roof, the latest and most buzz-worthy of a series of installations occurring citywide. The trend has also spread to Georgetown, with a house on 33rd Street shedding dependence on traditional energy sources for installations of solar panels.
The eco-friendly panels save consumers money, as part of an energy business that has expanded drastically in the past decade, with industry experts estimating a 50 percent annual growth rate in the United States every year in the 2000s, according to the Los Angeles Times. The United States has yet to catch up to European countries in solar panel installation, however.
“Washington has twice the sunlight of Germany, the nation with the most solar energy in the world,” Anthony Conyers (COL ’12), a member of Georgetown Energy, said.
Georgetown Energy, a company founded by a group of Georgetown students, has been a key force in introducing solar energy to the surrounding neighborhood. The group advocates the use of solar energy, arguing that placing solar power saves D.C. residents money, according to the Georgetown Energy website. With a combination of a 3 percent discount offered by Georgetown Energy, a federal tax credit for installing a solar energy system, and a D.C. grant, D.C. residents can save up to 75 percent of the costs of a solar energy program, according to the Georgetown Patch.
“It makes sense for people in the D.C. area to consider solar energy, financially,” Conyers said. “D.C. offers one of the best solar incentive packages in the country, and all of us at Georgetown Energy are encouraging people to take advantage of them.”
The group consulted with the owner of the home at 1541 33rd St. NW, and helped him put in place the first residential solar program in Georgetown, according to Georgetown Energy.
Despite D.C. incentives, the Georgetown neighborhood holds a tight grip on setup of solar panels in the area. If the panels can be seen from any public road, the Old Georgetown Board, as well as the Historic Preservation Review Board, must first approve the installation, as much of Georgetown remains a historic district.
Though there are hurdles to jump when making the switch to solar panels in Georgetown, solar panel additions are on the rise throughout the District, most prominently at the White House; plans to set up solar panels and a solar water heater on the roof of the White House were announced on Oct. 5. The new program at the White House is not the first time a president attempted to install solar energy at the Executive Mansion. President Carter’s administration installed solar panels in 1979, during the OPEC oil embargo. Carter said that the solar water heater would still be producing energy in the year 2000, but the system only lasted for seven years and was removed by President Reagan.”

This fall the Georgetown University Women’s Center is celebrating 20 years since it first provided a unique forum to support, educate and empower women of all cultures, races, sexual orientations, genders and ages, according to its mission statement.
Laura Kovach, director of the women’s center, emphasized the importance of having the center on campus, touching on Georgetown’s Jesuit identity and the idea of cura personalis.
“The fact that Georgetown has sustained a women’s center for 20 years speaks to how Georgetown cares about its students, not just women but the entire community,” Kovach said. “Care for the whole person includes gender, and the GU Women’s Center has worked over the last 20 years to make gender equity a reality and to provide resources and space to support the entire Georgetown community.”
Having a women’s center comes a long way from campus relations when the first women stepped on campus. While the NHS has admitted women since 1903, the College did not integrate until 1969. The women’s center did not begin until 1990, however, 21 years after the campus went coed.
The center provides guidance and logistical support to student groups on campus, such as Take Back the Night, which hosts events that serve to raise awareness about issues of sexual, domestic and gender-motivated violence.
While the center focuses primarily on supporting women in the Georgetown environment, its events are often aimed at the entire community.
“We do recognize that women need to be in spaces with other women to share stories [and] experiences and support one another — however, there are times and spaces where we must address gender equity issues with the entire community,” Kovach said. “Both women and men are encouraged to utilize our resources and program with us so that we can continue to reach as many community members as possible.”
The center also works with student group GU Men Creating Change, which works to prevent sexual assault against women.
“The Women’s Center has always been supportive of GUMCC. When we weren’t an official [Student Activities Commission] group, they funded events and offered their office for our meetings. The staff is always friendly and supportive, I think because they recognize that we are ultimately working toward the same goal,” said Jackson Perry (COL ’12), co-chair of the group.
In the last few years, the center has seen a lot of changes.
“The center has grown in many ways since I started [in July 2008]. We launched the Women Advancing Gender Equality fellowship, Woman to Woman for faculty and staff and have sustained a successful Women’s History Month program,” Kovach said.
“The Women’s Center is a place that is equipped to handle any and every issue that could possibly be related to women. And although the name suggests that it is just for women, I see men in there all the time, men who want to get involved and play active roles in helping women. Students benefit from a place that is geared toward the whole body because of its many resources and connections to places like the Health Education Services, CAPS and the greater D.C. area. The Women’s Center is the catalyst that ensures that all needed services are available to women,” said Melissa Mays (COL ’11), the co-president of GU Women of Color, which sometimes co-sponsors events with the center.
The 20th anniversary celebration kicked off in the spring with a speech by Lilly Ledbetter, the namesake of a 2009 federal law that solidified fair pay for women, and a celebratory reception for the anniversary with Theresa DeGioia (COL ’89). The celebration continues this fall.
“Another goal is for Georgetown to help us fund a full-time programming coordinator position in the GU Women’s Center,” Kovach said.
The center continues to put on events throughout the year and will hold “Inside the Athletic Closet: Sexism and Homophobia in Sports,” on Oct. 25.
Students who utilize the center often feel very connected to it.
“I think that the WC is a safe space for women to come in and talk about a variety of issues – relationships, sexual abuse, school and career – and it acts as a strong supporter for gender equity on campus . It has helped me develop as a woman leader and an advocate for social change on campus,” said Claire Charamnac (SFS ’11), a WAGE fellow.
“When I walk into the Women’s Center, I feel safe and it is a place that I can come to talk or just relax, if need be,” Mays added.
“Equality for women at all levels can only happen when we engage men to think about and discuss how they understand gender equity issues and how they think about themselves as men. The responsibility for equality should be placed on the shoulders of our entire community and not only on the shoulders of women,” Kovach said.

Following the lead of over 60 other colleges and universities across the United States, The George Washington University is considering implementing gender-neutral housing for the 2011-2012 school year. The university’s final decision will be announced this fall, but the deliberation alone reflects a standpoint that contrasts with the more conservative views held at Georgetown.
GWU student group Colonials for Gender-Neutral Housing, founded in September 2009, has been working with Allied in Pride, GWU’s LBGT student association, the GW Student Association and other student organizations on the issue of mixed-gender housing.
In January 2010, a SA senate resolution passed advocating the implementation of GNH at GWU, and the proposal was brought before the administration.
The Colonials for Gender-Neutral Housing seek to open GNH to all students at GWU, including incoming freshmen, in a voluntary program.
“The beauty of the program is that it benefits students who want to partake in it and does not affect students who do not want to participate,” Michael Komo, the three-year president of Allied in Pride and four-year member of its executive board, wrote in an email.
Participation in the program would require a request to live with a specific roommate of the opposite gender. No student would be placed randomly with a member of the opposite sex.
While the issue of gender-neutral housing has not yet been raised at Georgetown, preliminary discussions to consider gender-neutral bathrooms occurred in fall 2009.
The current administration is not in favor of gender-neutral housing, citing a perception that current housing arrangements accommodate student needs.
“Coed residence halls with single-gender living units and bathrooms are welcoming and comfortable, providing the right balance of community living spaces and privacy that is important to students on our campus. We don’t have any plans to change our policies in this area,” university spokeswoman Julie Bataille said in an email.
Komo, however, thinks that students would feel equally at home in gender-neutral halls.
“GNH will allow students to be happy in their living environment – meaning they will be happier students. This will help ensure that they will perform better in their classrooms and have an overall better GW experience,” Komo said.
Critics of the program argue that GNH will allow romantically involved couples to live together, potentially creating tension in on-campus dorms. Komo refuted the criticism by observing that same-sex couples already have the option to share rooms, but that they rarely choose to do so. Statistically, he said, less than 1 percent of students who participate in GNH opt to room with a romantic partner.
GWU established its Escaping Gender Living and Learning Cohort three years ago. The cohort houses six students and is the only gender-neutral campus housing option. While Georgetown has no designated gender-neutral housing program, all Living Learning Communities are open to members of both sexes on mixed gender floors. In addition, many students opt for living arrangements with peers of different genders.
No school that has offered GNH has rescinded its program. Studies show that only 1 to 2 percent of students participate in GNH where it is available. Based on those numbers, the “Colonials for Gender-Neutral Housing foresee participation of 100 to 200 students in the pilot year of their program.
Though the program has not been officially approved, student supporters at GWU seem to feel confident about the proposal and the benefits that it will offer. According to Komo, the program is designed simply to make students more comfortable.
“GNH is a program in which friends will be able to live with their friends with whom they are most comfortable regardless of gender,” he said.

With no clear launch date in sight, the first major overhaul and redesign of the university’s main website since 2002 remains at a standstill.
The university was last cited as saying the new website was set to operate by the end of the 2009-2010 academic year. According to university spokeswoman Julie Bataille, the university hopes the revamped site will be up and running by the end of the semester, but no specific date has been set.
“We’re very near launch. The timing is still being worked out,” said Scott Anderson, the university’s web communications manager. Anderson declined to comment further or discuss what has caused the delay.
“The main outstanding issue right now in terms of timeline is getting the new content management system in place to support the site,” Bataille said of the holdup. “[University Information Services] is in regular contact with them and working through implementation issues to move the project forward.”
Despite the slow progress, many positive changes will be reflected in the updated version. The university showcases the test site of an interactive and visual map tool of campus buildings with fresh interfaces and new features at https://maps-test.uis.georgetown.edu/.
Bataille also said the website’s renovations account for shortcomings in both image and infrastructure.
“The project involves not just a new front end design but also the implementation of a new back end technical infrastructure and content management system to support it,” she said.
Students, faculty, staff and parents of Georgetown students were consulted during the project to provide feedback on functionality and aesthetics.
any freshmen who spent time last year navigating the website during the application process were less than impressed with the current format, which has been in place since 2002.
“It’s really hard to navigate,” Katrina Perito (COL ’14) said, adding that she opted for other search methods. “I would just go to Google and search for what I needed that way.”
“Honestly, I didn’t really like it,” said Matt Kietlinski (COL ’14), who also said he resorted to alternative search methods. Kietlinski used hoyasaxa.com, a Georgetown-centric search tool, to look for the specific pages he needed.
The university declined to comment on the costs associated with the project.
