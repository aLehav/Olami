Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) reflected on the accomplishments of the late Secretary of State and Georgetown professor Madeleine Albright at a symposium held in her honor.
The Clintons joined moderator Melanne Verveer, the first U.S. Ambassador for Global Women’s Issues, to celebrate Albright’s life of public service and her commitment to her students at the final speaker event of the Sept. 29 symposium, which featured a morning session and a slate of speaker events in the afternoon session. 
President Clinton said in his final conversation with Albright just weeks before her death, she said she didn’t want to waste time discussing her health — she wanted to talk about Ukraine. 
“I’ll never forget it. It was an amazing conversation, it was so vintage Madeleine,” former President Clinton said at the event. “She was just a really smart woman that couldn’t imagine why you waste the last few weeks of your life on reminiscences or regrets when you’d had the life she’d had and there was so much still to do.”
Secretary Clinton spoke on Albright’s personability and unique ability to connect with others.
“Madeleine really had a capacity for friendship; she was somebody who loved to host dinner parties, who loved to go out to dinner, loved to have conversations and loved to come to the White House residence and put her feet up,” Secretary Clinton said at the event. “It was incredibly disarming because she was not at all shy about expressing her opinions, including on matters of some delicacy.”
The morning session of the symposium featured a single speaker event titled “The World She Shaped: Albright’s Academic Legacy,” where G. John Ikenberry, a professor at Princeton University; Stacie Goddard, a professor at Wellesley College; Deborah Avant, a professor at the University of Denver; and ​​Angela Stent, Professor Emerita at Georgetown University, discussed Albright’s commitment to protecting democracy, her role in bringing countries like Poland, Hungary and Czechia into NATO and the role of women in democracy.
Walsh School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman kicked off the afternoon session of events and said Albright has left a lasting impact on her students, the Georgetown community and the world.
“Madeleine Albright changed the world by empowering others,” Hellman said at the event. “She inspired generations of students not only to understand the world, but to serve the world. And her students, so many of whom are here today, went on to do just that — a legacy that is almost incalculable.”
Albright would have celebrated her 40th year as a Georgetown professor this Fall, and although she eventually became known for a lifetime of service at the apex of U.S. foreign policy and as the first female U.S. Secretary of State, Hellman said she always preferred to be known first and foremost as a professor. 
“She said to me, ‘the one thing I tried hardest not to give up was my classroom,’” Hellman said. “Madeleine Albright lived the values of our school and was the very essence of Georgetown in so many ways. We’re proud to call her ours and we’re blessed by what she gave us.”
Albright’s sharp sense of humor, unparalleled diplomatic mind and unwavering commitment to democracy were among the topics U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield spoke about with moderator Verveer at the second event of the afternoon session.
Sherman said Albright’s approach to diplomacy emphasized listening, learning and growing, not just persuasion.
“It’s about remembering that no matter where you are in the world, whether you’re across the table from a friend or from an adversary, you have to be able to put yourself in your counterpart’s shoes to remember that they too are human beings with their own histories, their own interests, their own points of view,” Sherman said. “That’s the spirit Madeleine brought to her classroom here at Georgetown.”
Thomas-Greenfield said Albright was her role model, shaping the way she has approached her role as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, a seat Albright filled around 25 years prior.
“When she spoke, people listened. She was grateful, graceful, generous and strong. She was whip-smart, but at the same time down to earth. I remember thinking to myself, ‘This is what leadership looks like,” Thomas-Greenfield said at the event. “I will always have her as the pin sitting on my shoulders, guiding me as we take on some of the world’s most pressing challenges.”
President Clinton said Albright’s efforts to find joy in her work made her a particularly compelling negotiator. 
“She thought if people could see that you like them, even if you thought they were wrong politically, that it made a big difference in the conduct of human affairs,” President Clinton said at the event. “You have to realize that as intensely as you care, you should still live. The way she lived made her more effective politically — she did better when she was chewing out with a smile on her face.”

The Georgetown University Renewable Energy and Environmental Network (GREEN) launched a food recovery network project aimed at addressing food insecurity in Washington, D.C.
The network, pioneered by Daniella Passariello (MSB, SFS ’23) and Nadia Sadanandan (NHS ’24), aims to cut down on food waste and aid those experiencing food insecurity. The project is part of the Food Recovery Network (FRN), an organization comprising over 180 colleges and universities that are actively donating surplus food to local organizations. The network is the largest student-led movement against food waste and working to end hunger throughout the country.
Passariello said she was motivated to start a chapter at Georgetown after learning about the organization in an environmental studies class during her sophomore year.
“I thought it was the perfect idea for Georgetown and I was so excited to join the chapter but when I googled to find Georgetown’s chapter I noticed we didn’t have one. American University and George Washington University did, but we did not,” Passariello wrote to The Hoya. “It was a bit confusing for me to find this out knowing how much impact Georgetown could generate if we started our own food recovery network.”
Passariello said she reached out to GREEN at the end of last year hoping to launch a chapter at Georgetown. Sadanandan, co-lead of GREEN’s Zero Waste team, said she took on the project with Passariello after she reached out. 
Although the network has not been launched yet, Passariello and Sadanandan plan to meet with representatives from Aramark, Georgetown’s primary food service provider, to discuss the logistics of the project.
Currently the pair plans to store leftover food from dining locations on campus in refrigerators provided by Aramark before being distributed to nonprofit organizations tackling food insecurity, Passariello said.
Molly Austin (SFS ’25), another co-lead for GREEN’s Zero Waste team, said Georgetown’s FRN chapter will help to reduce food waste and simultaneously help those experiencing food insecurity. 
“On this campus we generally have a variety of food options, but unfortunately, many individuals in the greater DC community lack this same accessibility to food,” Austin wrote to The Hoya. “FRN seeks to bridge the gap between the food that would otherwise be wasted on Georgetown’s campus and the people who need it most in the broader DC community.”
Given the prevalence of food insecurity throughout the District, Passariello said she felt impassioned to bring the food recovery network to Georgetown’s campus.
“About one in ten Americans experiences food insecurity in some form, while nearly 40% of all food produced in the US is wasted,” Passariello wrote. “In the DC region one in three people face food insecurity which is exacerbated by the economic disparities between Wards. This presents us with an opportunity to serve our community and promote the issue of food waste and food justice on campus.”
Passariello and Sadanandan hope to put a trial run in place by the end of October, during which food will be collected from Royal Jacket. 
Royal Jacket was selected to pilot this program given its convenience and ability to make an immediate impact, Sadanandan said.
“The easiest way to start for a trial run would be a place with packaged foods, like Royal Jacket,” Sadanandan said to The Hoya. “Leo’s would probably be the most difficult place to start this because they do have the buffet style.”
While Passariello and Sadanandan have not determined which nonprofit organizations they will partner with, they are currently thinking about distributing the food collected to Miriam’s Kitchen, a nonprofit aimed at ending chronic homelessness in D.C., and Martha’s Table, a nonprofit providing healthy food access throughout the District.
One concern with this new initiative is the possible legal implications, especially if expired food is donated. However, a D.C. law coined the Good Samaritan Act provides liability protection for food donors. According to Passariello, this law has helped make Aramark eager to help with the project.
Passariello and Sadanandan said they hope to partner with several on-campus organizations to make this project successful, including Hoya Hub, a pantry that serves as a resource for Georgetown community members experiencing food insecurity, and Georgetown Homeless Outreach Programs and Education, a club focused on issues of homelessness and housing justice. 
Passariello said they have been able to recruit more than 40 students to work with the FRN on campus.
“The amount of students that are excited to volunteer and help with recovery runs shows how this issue of food waste at Leo’s has been on students’ minds for a really long time and it is finally time to take action by simultaneously creating impact in our community,” Passariello wrote.

William Gaston, after whom the historic Gaston Hall in Healy Hall is named, owned 163 enslaved people and supported judicial opinions that opposed equal citizenship for Black people, according to newly released research obtained by The Hoya that was conducted by a Georgetown University Law Center (GULC) professor.
Previous accounts of Gaston’s slaveholding painted an unduly progressive picture of his legal stances on slavery, stating he only owned up to 40 enslaved people, according to a letter sent to University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) by John Mikhail, a Carroll Professor of Jurisprudence at GULC. Gaston was Georgetown’s first student and also helped secure the university’s federal charter.
Mikhail found an estate inventory that listed the names and ages of 163 enslaved individuals, including 21 children under five years of age, whom Gaston owned at the time of his death, when researching on Ancestry.com, where he had gone to find tax and census records on Gaston. Mikhail’s research also suggests Gaston may have enslaved up to 26 families spanning three or more generations.
In the letter, Mikhail said uncovering the truth about Gaston’s ties to slaveholding is an important step in raising awareness about the enslaved individuals connected to Georgetown’s legacy and their families.
“Of course, these children and their siblings, parents, and grandparents were not numbers. Each one had a name, a story, and people who loved them,” Mikhail wrote in the letter. “In all likelihood, many of them had descendants, some of whom are alive today.”
Mikhail’s archival research also reveals that while Gaston was a judge on the Supreme Court of North Carolina, he ruled that Black people, including former enslaved people, were state citizens in North Carolina v. Manuel. However, he upheld a state law that favored racial discrimination and white supremacy, rejecting the concept of equal citizenship under the law for Black people. Later in North Carolina v. Will, Gaston ruled that an enslaved person’s use of self-defensive force against their overseer was almost always unlawful.
Upon uncovering this information, Mikhail said he felt it was important to share that Gaston was a much more significant slaveholder than had previously been understood.
“I started to realize that there was more and different information here than people were aware of,” Mikhail told The Hoya. “It motivated me to get as accurate a picture as I could and then share it with people because I thought it might raise awareness and change the conversation around Gaston.”
In collaboration with other faculty members and students, Mikhail has spent the past six years researching Gaston. Beyond Gaston’s connections to political and legal history in the United States, Mikhail said he was inspired to learn more about Gaston following the publication of the 2016 report by the Working Group on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation.
Mikhail said his research produced two main findings that contradicted previous understandings of Gaston.
“First, Gaston’s slaveholding was far more extensive than the Report implies,” Mikhail wrote in the letter. “Second, his judicial opinions involving race and slavery were less progressive than is often assumed.”
DeGioia founded the Working Group on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation in 2015 following dialogue surrounding the designation of Mulledy Hall, which was named for Georgetown President Thomas Mulledy. Mulledy authorized the sale of 314 slaves owned by the Society of Jesus in Maryland in 1838, referred to as the GU272+, to financially sustain the university.
In 2016, the Working Group published a report reflecting on its findings with recommendations for DeGioia, one of which called for further research on campus sites and programs named for people with a connection to the history of slavery. The group disbanded after publishing the report, according to professor Adam Rothman, curator of the Georgetown Slavery Archive and a former member of the Working Group.
​​The group was led by History Professor Fr. David Collins, S.J., and consolidated the work of faculty, staff, students and graduates to provide advice and recommendations on how to properly acknowledge and recognize the university’s historic ties to slavery. Gaston Hall, a celebrated auditorium located in Healy Hall that hosts many of the heads of state and public figures who visit campus, was on the list of campus locations connected to slavery.
Mikhail said he shared the letter with every faculty member on the Working Group and is in the process of disseminating it to the larger campus community to raise awareness about Gaston’s extensive slaveholding.
A university spokesperson said the university has been in contact with Mikhail since DeGioia received his letter.
“President DeGioia has met with Professor Mikhail to hear about his findings directly. The University is closely reviewing his letter and considering how we may proceed given the emergence of this new research,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya.
Rothman said he helped Mikhail transcribe Gaston’s estate records and said his research answers the Working Group’s call to action.
“This is what is supposed to happen — faculty and students and anybody else who else is interested takes up the time and runs with it, and continues and extends the research that we were part of,” Rothman told The Hoya.
Richard Cellini (COL ’84, LAW ’88), secretary-treasurer of the Georgetown Memory Project, an independent group that aims to identify enslaved people sold by the university in 1838, as well as locate their descendants and honor their legacy, said the contents of the letter represent a larger trend of information around the history of slavery going uncovered.
“I really was shocked that that Gaston’s involvement with slavery was so extensive and so hidden to the rest of us,” Cellini said in an interview with The Hoya. “But I was not surprised because we keep discovering time after time after time, not just at Georgetown, but all across the country, how much of this history has been erased and displaced.”
Professor Maurice Jackson (GRD ’95, GRD ’01), a Working Group member, said Mikhail’s research is part of a continual process of discovery, correction and revision that is characteristic of historical research.
“We didn’t have these details, and things just keep coming out,” Jackson told The Hoya. “This is just part of an ongoing process and he’s made a worthy contribution.”
Cellini said the findings prove the need for ongoing research in conjunction with the university to further investigate the links between Georgetown and its history of slavery.
“There should be new working groups, and they should be much broader than the old one,” Cellini said. “There’s a lot of stuff at Georgetown that still have very close ties to slavery.”
Rothman said Mikhail’s research illuminates the selectivity of memories about Gaston, which is highlighted by the distinction and prominence of Gaston Hall.
“It is a place that is suffused with historical memory except for the memory of slavery and Gaston’s relationship to it,” Rothman said. “Revealing this history just accentuates how heavily curated our historical memory is and how much it overlooks. This is all part of the process of telling the truth about our past.”

I am always surprised at news of major discoveries.  Ancient dinosaur bones and the like I can understand; layers of civilization have covered them for ages, and we just haven’t been around long enough to find them all yet.  
But another discovery of this kind at Georgetown rattles me down deep — is a much-needed wake up call for us all to heed as we uncover our own familial, institutional, and national histories. and as reckless calls are made around the country for dangerously narrowing the curricula of our children’s schools. 
The closing quote by Rothman captures the layers of complexity and nuance involved in such findings and, more importantly,   the need to continually rethink and radically expand the ways we curate our knowledge of our past — our collective memory.  Yet, our collective memory is only as valid as its genuine willingness and insistence to include all people’s histories. 
I am cautiously hopeful as I wait to see how the university leadership and greater community respond to this revelation.  Hopeful that they solicit many diverse voices in thoughtful dialogue and deliberations, and hopeful that their follow-through will be more transparent and expedient than the commitments made thus far in addressing the history of slavery at Georgetown.

Georgetown University students staged a vigil to mourn and protest the killing of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman who was killed while in police custody for improperly wearing a hijab.
Since 1981, Iran has mandated that women veil their hair with a hijab in public. The Guidance Patrol, or “morality police,” is charged with enforcing this law and arrested Amini for improperly wearing her hijab on Sept. 13. Amini died three days later from unclear circumstances; police claim she suffered a heart attack in detention, but prisoners reported seeing police officers torture her and fracture her skull.
Widespread protests broke out across Iran immediately following Amini’s death. Beginning in Kurdistan, Amini’s home province, women denounced Iran’s morality and speech laws, burning their hijabs, cutting their hair and chanting “woman, life, freedom” and “death to the dictator,” The Guardian reported.
Melanne Verveer, executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS) and former U.S. Ambassador for Global Women’s Issues, said these protests differ from previous uprisings in Iran in that both men and women have been rallying against the government for women’s rights.
Verveer said Iranian womens’ rights are seldom spoken about worldwide the way they are right now.
“One of the things that always struck me, having worked for years and years in this area of women’s rights, is how little we pay attention to women in Iran and don’t know a whole lot about what’s happening to them and just how incredible they are, in terms of their own leadership to try to change their circumstances,” Verveer said.
The protests have since spread to Tehran and worldwide — at the Lincoln Memorial on Sept. 23, Bahar Ghandehari (COL ’23) organized a protest that began with a vigil and ended with a march to the White House while protesters chanted Amini’s name.
Ghandehari said she hoped the protest would help unite Washington, D.C.’s Iranian community and raise awareness about the circumstances of Amini’s death.
“It is extremely important to remind each other that we are not alone in times like this,” Ghandehari wrote to The Hoya. “At the same time, I wanted non-Iranians to learn about Mahsa’s killing and the protests in Iran.”
Ghandehari said many young people came to the protest, including numerous non-Iranian students from Georgetown and other local universities.
“It truly warmed my heart to see so many people come together and stand in solidarity with people inside Iran,” Ghandehari said. “We ended up marching to the White House after the vigil, and chanting Mahsa’s name in the streets of D.C. was so powerful.”
Amini’s killing reflects a long-standing pattern of violence from Iranian morality police, Ghandehari said.
“This level of violence from Iran’s so-called “morality police” is not new,” Ghandehari wrote. “Another young woman’s life was cut short because of the Islamic Republic’s misogynistic and discriminatory laws.”
Nima Majidi (SFS ’23), the president of Georgetown’s Iranian Cultural Society, said Amini’s story is just one of many.
“Being a member of the Iranian diaspora means hearing these types of stories too often, and living in constant fear that the next person could be your loved one,” Majidi wrote to The Hoya.
Ghandehari said she hopes people continue to stay vocal and protest in the coming weeks and months.
“The most important thing right now is keeping the momentum going,” Ghandehari wrote. “I would love to see more students mobilizing and organizing demonstrations in Washington, D.C. Solidarity protests outside Iran are as important as those taking place inside the country.”

Georgetown University needs to step up in solidarity with Iranian women, students, and this movement.  They have said nothing.

The director of the Georgetown School of Nursing’s Bachelor of Science in Nursing program has received a prestigious award honoring her exceptional leadership in the field.
Michele A. Kane received the 2022 Isabel Hampton Robb Award for Outstanding Leadership in Clinical Practice at the National League for Nursing (NLN) Education Summit in Las Vegas Sept. 28-30. The award recognizes an individual who inspires passion and clinical reasoning in patient care, conducts evidence-based scholarly research focused on improving patient outcomes and challenges students to expand their clinical knowledge base in innovative ways.
Kane said she was surprised, overwhelmed and grateful to receive the award.
“I’m still kind of pinching myself. It really hasn’t sunk in that this is happening.” Kane told The Hoya. “I just did my career, I just did Michele. I just did. You know, it was just me, and I didn’t think it was worthy of that. But apparently NLN thought so.”
Kane began her nursing career in the United States Navy, accumulating multiple graduate degrees and holding a variety of leadership positions as she moved up the ranks. Kane holds a Ph.D alongside a BSN and MSN.
Kane said her experience in the Navy, while filled with obstacles to belonging, was also defined by the mentorship she received.
“Early in my career I was told, ‘You don’t belong here,’” Kane said. “But what is ironic is that, full circle, these senior individuals saw something in me that I didn’t see in myself, and then became my mentors.These positions, and what I did, is because of the mentoring of these men.”
Kane went on to become the first Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the Naval Medical Research Unit San Antonio, overseeing $40 million in research assets. She was also the first nurse to be deputy chief medical officer at the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, building a high-reliability model for 9.6 million beneficiaries.
For Kane, leadership is defined not by honorifics, but by breaking barriers and doing the right thing.
“But leadership is not a title, right? Because you can lead at any level. It’s about doing what’s right,” Kane said. “You have to have courage to do what’s right.”
Kane has undertaken multiple research projects that demonstrate leadership in patient care throughout every stage of her career. For instance, as a Ph.D student at Uniformed Services University, she studied the effects of embedded shrapnel in American casualties from Iran; her findings, which demonstrated a correlation between shrapnel and cancer development, continue to benefit veterans through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ Toxic Embedded Fragment Center.
Kane said the research project redefined the future trajectory of her career.
“That momentous study opened up the doors tremendously for me,” Kane said. “We took it from the bench all the way to the bedside to the veteran, in the care of the veteran.”
After years of research, Kane said she was motivated to move into teaching and education because of the core value the Navy instilled in her about the importance of mentorship.
“If you’re going to be a leader, you have to excel at driving change and challenging those rules that seem to be carved in,” she said.
Roberta Waite, dean of the School of Nursing, said the School of Nursing community is immensely proud of Kane for her achievement and grateful for the benefit students can reap from her experiences.
“Our School of Nursing students are benefitting from her incredible experiences in the field of nursing. Our country benefited from her dedicated service as an officer in the U.S. Navy,” Waite wrote to The Hoya. “We are proud to have Dr. Kane as a professional exemplar of education, practice, and leadership.”
Julia Ferrante (NHS ’24), a future nurse herself, has Kane as a professor for her Care of Adults with Physical Alterations course and recognizes Kane’s role in the Georgetown community.
Ferrante said Kane has proven to be an excellent mentor.
“She is an amazing professor and inspiring leader in the nursing field,” Ferrante wrote to The Hoya. “I feel lucky to learn from her and her experience.”
Kane feels lucky to not only have taught others, but to have learned from others as well.
“All of us are pioneers,” Kane said. “Yes, maybe I did push the boundaries a lot, but I had a lot of people clearing the way too.”
