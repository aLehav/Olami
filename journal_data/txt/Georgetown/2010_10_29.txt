Farooque Ahmed, a 34-year-old naturalized citizen of the United States from Pakistan, was arrested Oct. 27 for plotting terrorist attacks on four Metro stations in Northern Virginia.
While the details of the attacks remain unclear, the incident raised many concerns about the vulnerability of the city to future attacks.
Although officials do not believe the attacks were imminent, the threat reinforced the need for comprehensive security measures in case of an emergency.
Following Ahmed’s arrest, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority released a statement informing Metro riders about its security strategies. According to the statement, the Metro Transit Police Department has an ongoing security program that conducts random patrols of facilities. Earlier this year, the MTPD launched the Blue Terrorism Identification and Deterrence Effort to coordinate local officers with other law enforcement agents in anti-terrorist patrols. A recent grant by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has also provided more than $9.5 million for the creation of a new anti-terrorism taskforce.
Georgetown’s location in the nation’s capital makes it sensitive to the potential threats targeting the District.
“The National Capital Region and Georgetown University face significant challenges in both threat – the NCR presents a higher-probability target – and coordination [as] over 30 federal law enforcement agencies operate within our area,” said Gary Shiffman, Georgetown’s director of Homeland Security Studies, in an email.
To ensure protection of the campus community, the university has developed preparedness strategies to respond to emergency situations. Public Safety Alerts are sent to all students, faculty and staff to make them aware of recent criminal activity on or near campus. Students enrolled in the university’s emergency notification system, HOYAlert, are also contacted via text, voicemail and email in the instance of emergency.
“Regular interaction and building trust between the university and state and local first responders remains the critical ingredient to enhancing the safety and security of the campus community,” Shiffman said.
Although the university does have strategies in place, it is important for students to remain vigilant about their personal safety and to report anything that might appear suspicious. Students can review the emergency guides or enroll in HOYAlert on the university’s website.
“Georgetown has spent a lot of time enhancing our overall safety and emergency preparedness efforts in recent years and is always looking at ways we can improve,” university spokeswoman Julie Bataille said in an email
The persistent threat of terrorism has also been a particular challenge for the federal government when considering how best to secure national landmarks and government buildings.
In the past year, defense of the White House has come under particular scrutiny after Tareq and Michaele Salahi crashed a White House social dinner. The incident led to the dismissal of the White House social secretary and an internal review of Secret Service security procedures, according to CNN.
As at the White House, security at the U.S. Capitol, a popular internship destination for Georgetown students, remains strict. Prior to Sept. 11, the Capitol was open for entrance to any member of the public day or night. After the terrorist attacks, additional checkpoints for vehicle inspections were introduced outside the building, as well as extensive screening inside to ensure safety. The safety of the Capitol Visitor Center was also emphasized because it was designed to provide improved security at the Capitol and better protect members of Congress.
Closer, less famous sites also face security risks. The Washington Aqueduct, source of water to more than one million people around D.C., has received constant security improvements.
“[The security of the public water system] has been adjusted accordingly and is continuously reviewed and evaluated based on guidance and directives from the Department of Homeland Security and other national agencies,” the aqueduct’s website said. The aqueduct has its own laboratory to monitor the quality of the drinking water.
Despite the proximity of Georgetown to these sites, some students are not concerned about safety.
“I understand this kind of stuff happens. I use the buses every day to get to work, and I don’t think this will change that,” Gina Perlite (COL ’11) said.

After being abruptly awoken and evacuated from their residence hall early Saturday morning, displaced Harbin Hall residents began to piece together the morning’s events and reflect on the students who were said to be involved.
Initial reports claimed that police had responded to a student caller reporting an odor on the ninth floor and that they discovered a student-run drug or methamphetamine lab in room 926. Further investigation reportedly found that the makeshift lab was instead producing dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a psychedelic drug known for its capacity to induce vivid and intense hallucinations that are relatively brief in duration.
Police arrested three students Saturday morning, two of whom are currently facing charges in connection with the alleged DMT lab. Resident Charles Smith (SFS ’14) and University of Richmond student John Perrone, a guest of Smith, are currently scheduled for a January court date; John Romano (COL ’14), the other resident of Harbin 926, was cleared of charges and released Monday.
Romano was aware that Smith and Perrone were intending to produce DMT, according to a friend who asked not to be named and a blog post written by a Harbin resident with knowledge of the situation.
Smith, who hails from Andover, Mass., was known to be the more outgoing of the two roommates. According to Eleni Kessler (COL ’14), Smith seemed innocuous, though she said he never fit in perfectly.
“Charlie seemed like an OK guy. He definitely wasn’t as clean-cut as the stereotypical Georgetown student is,” she said. “There weren’t any red flags, though.”
A friend of Smith and Romano who asked not to be named described Smith as a bright student, adding that Smith was a “great kid, but very naive . thought he was indestructible.”
According to John Vandergruff (COL ’14), who lives on the ninth floor, the roommates were not outsiders.
“They were nice guys who made a bad decision,” he said.
Mark Berardi (COL ’14) said Smith and Romano were easily approachable.
“Even though they were stupid to do this to themselves, they were some of the most genuine, friendliest people I’ve met over the past couple months,” he said.
Kessler said that she was surprised to find out that Charlie could be behind the lab.
“I didn’t expect it from him. He looks like a little boy, like he’s 15,” she said.
A Long Island, N.Y. native, Romano kept mostly to himself, according to Maria Brzozowski (COL ’14), who was in his New Student Orientation group. “He was so quiet,” Brzozowski recalled.
She added that Romano intermittently disappeared from NSO activities, and that when in attendance, he was often listening to music.
Brzozowski said when news of the arrests first broke, she was surprised to learn Romano was involved. “Every third person at Georgetown is named John,” she said. It was only when someone referenced Romano’s NSO group that she realized who he was.
Another Harbin resident agreed with Brzozowksi’s impression. “He wasn’t as talkative [as Smith], so I didn’t really have much contact with him,” he said.
The resident added, “I think there was a lot of reason to suspect it would be John if you were just basing it off of his appearance.”
Harbin resident Kelly Baltazar, a friend of Smith and Romano, ran into her roommate in Sellinger Lounge on Saturday morning, and they began to talk for the first time in days. According to a blog post written by Baltazar’s roommate, Baltazar said – hours before major news sources reported that the drug lab was intended to produce DMT – that two students and a visiting friend had been trying to make DMT in their room, Harbin 926.
As for the odor that initially was said to have prompted the investigation, The Washington Post reported Tuesday that it may not have led to the discovery of the suspected DMT lab at all. According to the Post, Saturday’s search and arrests came after a student who had been approached outside of Harbin while smoking K2, a synthetic form of marijuana, led DPS officers to investigate Harbin 926.
Residents on the ninth floor said they did not smell anything suspicious around the time the student caller informed DPS of the strange odor.
“I have not met a single person on my floor who said they smelled anything,” a Harbin 9 resident said.
As of Monday, the university continued to say that the odor led to the investigation.
Harbin residents were permitted to re-enter their dorm after 6 p.m. Saturday evening, but it wasn’t until 8 p.m. that Baltazar returned to her room, according to her roommate’s blog. “She was crying because they took away her best friends and she was worried about them. `Skinny innocent C- in jail and easy-going J-. It’s not fair. I hate this school,'” the roommate wrote.
After 7 p.m. on Tuesday evening, Baltazar was arrested and led out of Harbin in handcuffs by MPD, according to university spokeswoman Julie Bataille. A search of Baltazar’s room minutes before had yielded marijuana.
Baltazar lives in Harbin 229, and is reportedly close to Smith. “I’d seen them hanging out,” a Harbin 9 resident said. “I saw them outside smoking hookah together.”
Baltazar’s arrest on Tuesday for possession with intent to distribute marijuana was not Baltazar’s first link to illicit substances. According to the DPS Baltazar was cited for possession of marijuana in September. Her roommate wrote on her blog that Baltazar had been suspended in high school for substance-related reasons. Baltazar’s Bronx, N.Y., high school, Riverdale Country School, declined to comment.
According to the blog kept by Baltazar’s roommate, Baltazar said her disciplinary history made her more cautious.

Two cases that resulted in separate arrests of Harbin Hall residents on drug-related charges on Saturday and Tuesday were linked by foreknowledge and personal ties, sources familiar with the suspects said this week.
Charles Smith (SFS ’14) and John Romano (COL ’14), along with visiting University of Richmond freshman John Perrone, were arrested early Saturday morning after officials found a suspected drug lab intended to produce dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in Smith and Romano’s Harbin 926 dorm room.
Second-floor Harbin resident Kelly Baltazar was arrested Tuesday evening and charged with possession with intent to distribute marijuana, according to Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Hugh Carew.
Baltazar was aware of Smith and Perrone’s plans to manufacture DMT before the lab was discovered by police, according to a friend of the three Georgetown students and a blog published by Baltazar’s roommate.
Sources said Baltazar was upset after the arrests of Smith, Perrone and Romano on Saturday morning by the decision to make DMT and to do so in a dorm room.
According to her roommate’s blog, Baltazar told her roommate about the buildup to Smith, Romano and Perrone’s arrest when she returned to her room Saturday evening. Her roommate summarized Baltazar’s account, writing, “C had his friend over for the weekend who brought all of the supplies and was like, `Hey guys let’s make some DMT.’ C agrees and his roommate J goes along with it.”
Although Romano was allegedly aware of the plans, a friend of the students said Romano was not involved in the possible manufacturing of the DMT. According to the blog, Baltazar said she did not think Romano should get into trouble, as it was not his idea to make the DMT.
Romano was released and cleared of all charges at a Monday hearing in U.S. District Court after Smith told officers that Romano was not involved in any illegal activity, according to The Washington Post. Romano and his parents were seen moving his belongings out of Harbin Hall on Thursday.
Smith and Perrone are facing federal charges for conspiracy to manufacture and possession with intent to distribute DMT. Both were released by the U.S. District Court on Wednesday to the custody of their parents, who live in Andover, Mass., until their next D.C. court date on Jan. 24.
The court mandated that Smith and Perrone wear ankle-bracelet monitoring devices to ensure that they stay within a to-be-determined radius in the Massachusetts and New Hampshire area. The suspects must obey a curfew and attend drug- and substance-abuse testing while seeking and maintaining full-time employment or enrollment at a university near their homes.
Smith and Perrone could be sentenced to 20 years in prison and charged $1 million in fines, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s federal trafficking penalties for allegedly manufacturing with the intent to distribute the Schedule 1 drug DMT.
Baltazar was released after pleading not guilty at her arraignment Wednesday. According to the D.C. Superior Court’s docket, she will now undergo drug testing and treatment, and her next hearing is scheduled for Nov. 19. Baltazar briefly returned to campus on Wednesday to retrieve a few items, but the majority of her possessions still remain in her dorm room.
All three students face potential penalties for Category C violations of the Student Code of Conduct because of their alleged intent to distribute and Smith and Perrone’s alleged intent to manufacture. Such violations can result in suspension or expulsion. The university has declined to comment on the status of the students’ enrollment, citing matters of confidentiality.
Baltazar had previously been referred to the Office of Student Conduct after a DPS officer discovered her smoking marijuana on Sept. 10 on Kehoe Field. The DPS report of the incident stated that Baltazarwas carrying marijuana and a grinder at the time.
According to her roommate’s blog, Baltazar had a history of drug-related incidents. Her roommate wrote on her blog that Baltazar made a drug deal in front of her in August. The blog also says that Baltazarsaid she was suspended in high school due to a drug-related incident. At press time, the blog had been removed from public access.
The DPS investigation of Baltazar’s drug activity began last Friday after DPS received an anonymous tip. A DPS officer, who remains anonymous due to DPS policy, said it took DPS until Tuesday to hone in on the suspect, at which point they searched her room. Baltazar was then arrested by MPD.
According to the MPD Incident Report, MPD discovered a green, “weed-like” substance that tested positive for THC, the main psychoactive substance found in the cannabis plant. The DPS officer alleged that the search yielded a quantity substantial enough to warrant a suspicion that there was intent to sell.
On Oct. 27, university spokeswoman Julie Bataille said that the university believes the two cases to be unrelated.
“This investigation is separate from another that remains ongoing related to the arrests of two other students, Charles Smith and John Romano, on drug charges over the weekend,” Bataille said in an email. “We are working actively with MPD to understand if there are any connections but at this time believe they are unrelated incidents.”
“We are certainly trying to get as full of an understanding of this situation as we can,” Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson said in an interview with THE HOYA on Monday.

The competitive nature of the D.C. Council’s primaries left the general elections largely uncontested. Four of D.C.’s eight wards are holding elections for their Council representatives on Nov. 2. In addition, two of the four at-large seats and the Council Chairmanship are up for grabs.
David Catania (SFS ’90, LAW ’94), one of the incumbent at-large Council members, and an Independent, is virtually assured of re-election, due to a lack of competition. When Catania first announced his re-election bid in January, Reverend Anthony Motley, a political ally of Marion Barry and an opponent of Catania’s policies, announced his candidacy for the at-large seat, but was disqualified in September by the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics due to a failure to collect 3,000 signatures to run for the election.
Catania has spent much of his three full terms fighting for the city’s recognition of same-sex unions and the legalization of same-sex marriage. He has been re-elected to full terms on the council in 1998, 2002 and 2006.
Catania has also made progress in the health sector as chairman of the Committee on Health, which he has chaired for five years. Since he became chair of the committee in 2005, the number of uninsured D.C. residents has fallen by more than 50 percent.
Catania’s bid is also aided by D.C. electoral rules stating that one of the at-large seats must go to a politician who is not a member of the majority party on the Council, which is currently controlled by Democrats.
Democratic candidate Kwame Brown is also favored to win the council chairmanship. Brown has won endorsements from the labor unions and the District of Columbia Chamber of Commerce. On Oct. 18, however, The Washington Post reported that Brown had more than $700,000 in debt and was being sued by credit card companies in the District of Columbia Superior Court for unpaid charges and interest over $55,000.
Brown defeated his major opponent, Vincent Orange, in the Democratic Primary on Sept. 24, 55 percent to 39 percent. He is running for chairman against a representative of the D.C. Statehood Green Party.
Ward 2, which includes Georgetown, is not holding elections this year.

Most Rev. Donald Wuerl, archbishop of Washington, was one of 24 clergymen to be given one of the Vatican’s highest honors last week, when he was elevated to cardinal status. Wuerl is the fifth archbishop of Washington, D.C., and the first since 2001 to receive the appointment.
On Oct. 20, Pope Benedict XVI announced the 24 additions to the College of Cardinals, a body charged with one of the most prominent tasks in the Catholic Church – electing the new pope from among its ranks.
Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., Georgetown’s executive director of campus ministry, said that the promotion seems in line with the papacy’s tradition of naming the D.C. archbishop a cardinal.
“The five-year wait has come because traditionally, a cardinal may continue voting in the College of Cardinals until he reaches the age of 80,” he said.
Taking over as D.C.’s archbishop from Cardinal Theodore McCarrick in 2006, Wuerl came to the District with 18 years behind him as bishop of Pittsburgh. McCarrick turned 80 on July 7, but will continue his membership in the College of Cardinals.
Wuerl’s time as D.C.’s archbishop has not been without controversy. Wuerl opposes same-sex marriage, which D.C. legalized last spring. Wuerl joined with several Baptist ministers to call for a vote on the definition of marriage, according to The Washington Post. Following the law’s passage, Wuerl transferred the archdioceses’ 80-year-old foster-care program to the National Center for Children and Families, due to the fact that the program would be legally obligated to treat same-sex couples equally during the foster-care process or lose all city funding.
Wuerl has also taken issue with Georgetown’s liberal interpretation of its role as a Catholic university.
“Institutions that are recognized as Catholic and that exercise their ministry and activities as a part of the Church and in the name of the Church are not independent from the Church,” Wuerl wrote in the Catholic Standard in May 2009.
He also voiced his concern when Georgetown’s Law School allowed a group supporting reproductive rights to give an award to Vice President Joe Biden on campus in April 2009. Wuerl last visited the Hilltop on Sept. 23, 2010, for a lecture commemorating Cardinal John Henry Newman’s beatification in Riggs Library, as a guest of University President John J. DeGioia, according to O’Brien.
Wuerl, a graduate of The Catholic University of America, serves as chancellor of CUA as part of his duties as the archbishop of D.C. and as the William Cardinal Baum professor of theology at CUA. The only other American to be appointed a cardinal last week was Raymond Burke, former archbishop of St. Louis, Mo., and current head of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, the Vatican’s equivalent of a Supreme Court.

The university is making headlines in the technology community following the release of a case study on the efficacy of telecommunications and videoconferencing in university classrooms.
Since 2008, the Hilltop has been home to a “global classroom,” featuring cutting-edge audiovisual communications technology, which students and faculty use to interact with their peers at the School of Foreign Service campus in Doha, Qatar.
The study, titled “Immersive Telepresence Solutions and Managed Services at Georgetown University,” was recently released by Glowpoint, the international video communication services provider that oversees and provides tech support for the global classroom. It details the educational and monetary benefits the university has been experiencing since the global classroom got its start at Georgetown two years ago.
The product of the collaborative efforts of the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship and the university’s technology staff, the global classroom stemmed from frustration over several failed trial runs with technologies that lacked the clarity and workability essential to the day-to-day functioning of the typical university classroom. Since 2000, CNDLS’s mission has been to integrate technology and pedagogic theory into new tools to improve the learning process for both teachers and students.
“We were trying to develop some classes that would take place both on the D.C. campus and on the Doha campus. The one thing that we really wanted was for a faculty member to walk into the room and not have to think about anything but teaching the class, so it would be basically seamless to connect,” said Randy Bass, the executive director of CNDLS.
After several experiences with technologies that produced less than satisfactory results, Bass put together a working group charged with finding a product that would allow students on both continents to feel like they were in the same classroom. From a functional standpoint, Assistant Director of Classroom Educational Technology Services John Steitz emphasized the need for the new international classroom to be accessible to faculty. “You want a system [in which] the faculty don’t have to know how it works. [If] they can work their own laptop, they know about as much as they need to use this room.”
Reflecting on her first experience with the global classroom, professor of international migration Susan Martin admits, “At first it was a bit intimidating to use the Telepresence classroom, but it is actually quite easy. The challenge was to integrate the two sides of the classroom. After only a couple of classes, they really relaxed and began to function more as a classroom.”
The students have had an equally positive reaction.
“You get to learn from people of different cultures that you wouldn’t normally meet, and I think this type of technology really opens means of communication between different people, between different groups,” Claudia Triana (SFS ’11) said.
“You learn so much in a classroom from the other students. When you can really use a global classroom to get students with completely and utterly different perspectives, it adds a whole new understanding of the readings and what you’re discussing,” Julie Walz (SFS ’10) said.
The benefits stretch beyond an overwhelmingly positive response from students and staff – the university has saved thousands of dollars in travel costs that were once used to bring guest speakers to campus.
“[With] the level at which it is used and the value it gives back both in terms of education and in terms of business solutions, there is no question that it’s worth everything we have spent on it, and I don’t think anyone regrets it,” Bass said.

As sophomores settle into their second year at Georgetown, they face decisions that will affect the rest of their time on the Hilltop, sometimes without as much support as freshmen, juniors and seniors are receiving.
While freshmen receive ample guidance from New Student Orientation and meetings with their deans, and juniors and seniors get support as they go abroad and prepare for life after graduation, some sophomores feel – and the university agrees – they are getting lost in the shuffle.
“I do think sophomores need help managing stress,” Maya Chaudhuri (SFS ’13) said.
The student affairs office, deans’ offices and other resources around campus are collaborating to better address the needs of second-year Georgetown students, who are sometimes overlooked as attention is often focused on freshmen and upperclassmen.
The idea for Sophomore Year Experience came in January 2009 when administrators, mostly within the department of student affairs, began talking about the need for additional sophomore year support.
Many colleges and universities have similar programs, including Colgate, Haverford, Brandeis and St. Louis University.
“The sophomore year is a time of important decisions for our students – in regard to majors, study abroad plans, internship decisions, choosing long-term friendships, and possible career directions. During this year, it’s important to provide resources for students in ways that meet their needs,” said Todd Olson, vice president for student affairs.
“The student response has been mixed as we have tried different events throughout our two years,” said Bill Huff, area coordinator of the Southwest Quad and Village C East. Huff has been involved in the process since its inception.
Some students expressed a real need for this continued support on campus.
“I feel like teachers are less understanding with sophomores. They expect you to be on top of your game and there is a lot of pressure to get better grades now that you are `adjusted,'” Chaudhuri said.
Others were more skeptical of the program.
“I don’t think that this is really needed. I feel like sophomore year is a time to help `cut the cord’ and start to go out and contact university offices by yourself – so you can learn how to actually interact in the world where the answers to problems are not put right in front of you, but where you have to seek it out yourself,” Sean Guilday (COL ’13) said.
Looking back on her four years, one senior said that she received a lot of support during her first two years of school, but by the time she was an upperclassman, she has been able to seek out resources on her own.
“Junior and senior year, I’ve been getting support but not in the sense that every little thing I had trouble with, I would go to [various support networks on campus]. I mostly have gone to my dean with academic questions about my major requirements, graduation requirements, et cetera,” senior Elizabeth Meerson (COL ’11) said.
While the program is in its early stages, some students felt that it has been inadequately advertised.
“We have tried several ways to spread the word about Sophomore Year Experience on campus,” Huff said. “We typically use traditional promotional methods – fliers, blurbs on listservs – with moderate success. We have assessed our success with the sophomore focus groups we facilitated last spring and will be doing again this coming November,” Huff said.
The collaboration will continue to develop and hopes to bring in more resources from around campus, as well as seek more input from sophomores themselves, according to Huff.
“This year we are continuing to conduct focus groups . with current sophomores to learn what they want/expect in their sophomore year and will do some again at the end of the year to see what their experience was like overall,” Huff said. “I would love to see SYE become a permanent entity on campus perhaps with a part-time staff member working to promote support for second-year students and a space on campus sophomores could go to look for that support. But that is long term, five to 10 years.”

Georgetown’s eco-friendly practices deserve a B grade, according to the nonprofit Sustainable Endowments Institute, which evaluates colleges and universities every year on their environmental efforts in its College Sustainability Report Card.
The grade from the 2011 edition of the ratings remains the same as last year’s, but it is a significant improvement from earlier scores. The first report card, published in 2006, gave Georgetown a C+.
Audrey Stewart, the university’s program coordinator for sustainability, said she is happy with the score.
“Georgetown deserves credit for what it is doing well,” she said in an email. “Our recycling program is impressive compared to many of our peer institutions, and our climate commitment is ambitious and on track. The SEI recognized that by giving us an A in each of those categories.”
The report’s assessment includes nine policy categories in total. The university also received A’s in two categories related to endowment, but it scored B’s for the sustainability of its administration, green building, student involvement and transportation. It also received a D for the transparency of its billion-dollar endowment, since it releases no specific details on where the money is invested.
Stewart said that fostering student participation in sustainability was a particular challenge.
“[Student involvement] improves not through basic infrastructure changes but through new forms of partnerships, education and relationship-building,” she said. “It makes sense that it will take longer. And as always, a challenge goes back out to students to develop effective and meaningful ways to act as partners in the process.”
The report also praised the university’s pledge that any new buildings it constructs will meet the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standard for energy-efficient architecture. The Rafik B. Hariri Building earned LEED certification earlier this year.
Georgetown has also made a public commitment to reducing its emissions of greenhouse gases per square foot of building space to half of their 2006 level by the end of the next decade. The university has already cut emissions by 20 percent.

A new Mozilla Firefox extension allows anyone on a wireless network to access user accounts on sites like Facebook and Twitter, raising concerns over the cyber security of Georgetown’s network.
Firesheep, which was released for free download earlier this week by software developer Eric Butler, allows users to view all the accounts of other Wi-Fi users logged into many popular social networks. If they choose, the users can also log in to any of these accounts with just a click.
For regular users of large wireless networks, such as the primary Georgetown University network “HOYAS,” the application represents a threat to online security.
Beth Ann Bergsmark, director of academic and information technology, said that the university is aware of the threat and encouraging users to protect their information. But few students said they were aware of Firesheep.
“It sort of creeps me out,” said Kristina Wilson (COL ’13), summing up the reactions of many.
Firesheep exploits the weaknesses of many websites who do not sufficiently protect “cookies,” or saved login information. Butler created the application to demonstrate how serious the problem is.
“On an open wireless network, cookies are basically shouted through the air, making these attacks extremely easy,” he wrote on his website when he released Firesheep.
Bergsmark said that university applications such as Blackboard, MyAccess and GUMail are safe from intruders via programs such as Firesheep. Gmail, which encrypts data transfers, is also safe.
“But you are still vulnerable if you are connecting to other websites like Facebook or Twitter that do not encrypt all of your data transfers,” Bergsmark said. Other sites that could be hacked by Firesheep include WordPress, Yelp, Flickr, Amazon and Tumblr.
Bergsmark recommended that students sign out of any vulnerable accounts when they are finished with the website.
“This is very important,” she said. “If you do not log out, anyone can snoop in on your session, track where you have been, and capture your personal information.”
Bergsmark also recommended replacing the “http” in any web address with “https,” which encrypts your session on some, but not all, websites. She said that it is important to use different passwords so that if hackers steal a Facebook password, for example, they cannot also access your bank account.
Future University Information Services upgrades might help reduce the vulnerability of the Georgetown network.
“UIS is planning on deploying secure wireless authentication and encryption in areas that can support this technology after the roll-out of the new wireless capability in the residence halls,” Bergsmark said.
While students expressed concern over the safety of their online accounts, they also said they could understand the logic behind Firesheep.
“I guess it makes me think about other programs that can access your information online,” Melissa McClure (COL ’13). “But it’s just a very strange way to do it.”

As most of campus lay dormant early Saturday morning, a test of the university’s crisis management protocol was just beginning.
 
Once authorities had discovered an alleged drug lab in a ninth-floor Harbin Hall room, officials ordered an immediate evacuation of the building due to safety concerns. Harbin residents awoke not to their alarms, but to a rushed departure conducted by police and resident assistants. They evacuated the building room-by-room around 6 a.m., after the fire alarm system failed to sound on the first try. Ninth-floor residents were initially told to report to the common room on the eighth floor.
 
 
 
According to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, the residence hall’s alarms underwent a routine inspection just last week and passed fire safety standards along with other on-campus buildings. On Monday, university spokeswoman Julie Bataille confirmed the alarm system passed a D.C. Fire Marshal’s inspection prompted by Saturday’s alarm malfunctioning; alarm tests of other residence halls occurred Wednesday and Thursday.
 
 
 
“We’ve had technicians looking at it, but they have assured us it was a one-time problem,” Olson said, adding that the internal mechanism alerting Department of Public Safety personnel and the Office of Residence Life did work correctly on Saturday morning.
 
 
 
But Saturday’s glitch may not be the first to have occurred in Harbin this calendar year. After an eighth-floor kitchen fire in April, Vice President for Facilities and Student Housing Karen Frank told THE HOYA that DPS was notified via a smoke detector.
 
 
 
“All fire protection systems, including the fire alarm, functioned as they should,” she said at the time. Harbin residents in the building when the fire broke out, however, said that alarms either failed to activate or could only be set off with a delay.
 
 
 
Luis Fortuno (SFS ’14), a resident of Harbin’s eighth floor, was so startled by the officials banging on his door around 6 a.m. that he approached his entryway armed with a tennis racquet for protection. But the calls did not stir everyone, said one student living on the ninth floor; he didn’t wake up until around 7:15 a.m., about an hour after the intended evacuation of Harbin’s 400-plus residents.
 
 
 
The day of the incident, other students living in Harbin told of a chaotic departure from their residence hall.
 
 
 
“We were just kind of following the crowd like cattle,” said Joanne Esteban (SFS ’14), a resident of Harbin 7.
 
 
 
With little to none of their personal belongings – including GOCards, midterm study materials and laptops – pajama-clad residents eventually descended on Sellinger Lounge, the Intercultural Center and O’Donovan Hall as they waited for the OK to return to their rooms.
 
 
 
At 9:19 a.m., Executive Director of Academic Housing Patrick Killilee emailed Harbin residents that it was safe to head back, only to send a message four minutes later reneging on the go-order. The alarms functioned properly during the second evacuation.
 
 
 
As many Harbin residents headed to Leo’s for breakfast (they were permitted to enter without a swipe of their GOCard), other Georgetown students caught wind of the drug bust, particularly as campus, local and national media outlets picked up the story.
 
 
 
“I didn’t think it was true,” said Audrey Avila (NHS ’13), who was eating in Leo’s around 10:30 a.m. She said Harbin residents seemed visibly frustrated. “They were confused and arguing with each other about whether they could get in [to the dorm] or not.”
 
 
 
The official response to student concerns came about three hours later, when Olson sent a blast email to Harbin residents updating them on the situation. Triggered by suspicions of methamphetamine production in a Harbin room, an impending inspection by Drug Enforcement Administration personnel would determine whether students could safely return. Further investigation found that the clandestine lab was producing dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a hallucinogenic known to induce a near-death or dream-like state.
 
 
 
Around 2 p.m., all of campus was forwarded Olson’s email to Harbin residents; for students like Adrian Mansylla (MSB ’13), the university’s message, though informative, was not prompt enough.
 
 
 
“The information was good, but it was too late,” Mansylla said.
 
 
 
“We shouldn’t have had to look things up on the Internet,” Avila added.
 
 
 
On Saturday morning around 10 a.m., Alex Honjiyo (SFS ’13) was left wondering why he had not heard from the university even though media outlets had been reporting at the time that the roads around Georgetown were closed due to the drug lab.
 
 
 
Neither the university’s emergency HOYAlert notification system nor the Campus Alert System – a series of steam whistles that signal to the campus community to take shelter when activated – were utilized on Saturday during the seven hours between the first evacuation and Olson’s first broadcast email.
 
 
 
“It was clear to us from all the guidance we were getting that there was not a threat to the broader community. There was not a safety risk to the broader community,” Olson said.
 
 
 
After being cordoned off with caution tape for much of the day, Harbin Patio was reopened Saturday evening. At 6:26 p.m., residents were permitted to enter the building once it had been cleared of any safety risks by the DEA. Thankful to be back in their rooms, many residents were at ease with the university’s response.
 
 
 
“They wouldn’t let 400 students back in the building if it wasn’t safe,” said Jessica Kocan (COL ’14) a Harbin fifth floor resident.
On Saturday, Charles Smith (SFS ’14), John Romano (COL ’14) and University of Richmond freshman Joseph Perrone were arrested for manufacturing a controlled substance. Romano was cleared of charges and released on Monday, while Perrone and Smith face federal charges. On Tuesday, Harbin resident Kelly Baltazar was arrested for possession and intent to distribute marijuana.
