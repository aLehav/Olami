Adjunct professor Ron Klain (CAS ’83) will coordinate the United States’ response to Ebola, according to media reports Friday morning.
As “Ebola czar,” Klain will be responsible for federal response to any outbreak in the United States. He will report to White House homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco and National Security Advisor Susan Rice, according to CNN.
“It may make sense for us to have one person … so that after this initial surge of activity, we can have a more regular process just to make sure that we’re crossing all the T’s and dotting all the I’s going forward,” President Obama said to CNN.
Klain is a former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden and is currently president of Case Holdings and general counsel of Revolution, an investment group.
Klain has taught at Georgetown for several years, and is teaching the government department seminar “Presidential Debates” this semester.

A tentative plan to combine Georgetown’s LGBTQ Center, Women’s Center and Center for Multicultural Equity and Access has drawn criticism from students opposed to any sort of merger.
According to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, the administration has not made any concrete plans to consolidate these offices. Olson discussed the issue with students during his open office hours last Friday.
“We are considering ways to create more coherence in the programming and work of these offices,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are committed to preserving the distinctive identities and ‘safe spaces’ of these three important offices. We are looking at opportunities to locate all three offices near each other. … No decisions have been made about this, and we will continue engaging with students and listening to their perspectives.
The LGBTQ Center, the first of its type at an American, Catholic university, was created in 2007 after University President John J. DeGioia convened a working group in reaction to a rash of hate crimes against LGBTQ students.
The CMEA aims to serve students who have traditionally faced discrimination due to race or ethnicity by providing multicultural programming, diversity education and academic support. The Student of Color Alliance, the Community Scholars Program and the Black House are among the programs and services provided by CMEA.
The Women’s Center was founded in 1990 and offers a number of programs to support women on campus, including the Are You Ready sexual assault awareness campaign, the Women and Gender Equity fellowship program and programming for Women’s History Month and Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
The centers all have dedicated staff members who run programming and services for their respective audiences. Olson did not specify to students or to The Hoya whether a merger of the centers would eliminate staff positions or cut costs.
CMEA Director Charlene Brown-McKenzie, Academic Resource Center Director Jane Holahan, Women’s Center Director Laura Kovach, LGBTQ Resource Center Director Sivagami Subbaraman, and Associate Dean of Students and CMEA Director Dennis Williams released a joint statement about the consolidation at the beginning of the month, and said that they are still in the early stages of discussion.
“We are just beginning conversations on how we can move forward in supporting the communities we serve in a much more collaborative and purposeful way,” they wrote in the statement. “At the core of our re-thinking is student experiences and needs, and how best we may address these in a changing demographic in higher education.”
Although the ARC was involved in the creation of the joint statement, it is not currently being considered to be part of the consolidation.
Some schools do have similar combined resource centers targeted to these disparate groups, including the Center for Diversity and Inclusion at American University, which encompasses LGBTQ, multicultural, first-generation and female students, and the Multicultural Resource Center at Oberlin College and Conservatory, which supports “historically underrepresented” students. Several universities combine resources for women and LGBTQ students. Nearly all of the top 20 universities Georgetown typically considers its peers have separate resource centers for each group.
The university has discussed the possible consolidation in focus groups made up of students who utilize the centers and would be affected by the change. At these focus groups, Olson has also discussed alternatives to the merger, such as putting the three centers on the same floor and creating larger, more up-to-date spaces for each group. The LGBTQ Center and Women’s Center are currently on the third floor of the Leavey Center, while the CMEA is on the fifth floor of the Leavey Center.
According to GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15),the focus groups have clearly shown that students are not in favor of a consolidation.
“There is not a single student leader who thinks that a formal unified office is a good idea. At the meeting, every single [one] was strongly opposed to the idea,” Lloyd said. “While a common lounge space, or a new advisory structure separate from student affairs might signal a renewed commitment to our diverse communities, merging the centers would only undermine their mission.”
A consolidation would be of particular detriment to the LGBTQ Center, Lloyd said, given its history as the first of its kind at a Catholic university.
“As the most frequent collaborator of the LGBTQ Resource Center, and as the organization that facilitated its founding, GU Pride would not want Georgetown to water down or muddle the historic institution that is the first ever such resource center at a Catholic school,” Lloyd said.
A student petition against the initiative on Georgetown’s IdeaScale platform, has reached 599 upvotes in a little over a week. The petition, started by GUSA Undersecretary of Gender Affairs Mariel Jorgensen (COL ’16), says that each group serves a unique purpose that caters to students’ personal identities.
“While students recognize the value of intersectionality, there is even greater value in an individual’s ability to access safe spaces on campus created to support their personal identity,” Jorgenson wrote in the petition.”An aggregate center would be less able to understand and perform the sensitive work done by current centers, which are more intimately familiar with the specific needs of the students who reach out to them.”
Many students involved in GUSA have spoken to Olson about the proposal and are against it.
GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Megan Murday (SFS ’15) attended Olson’s office hours on Friday to express her concerns with the plan.
“I went to Dr. Olson’s office hours out of concern for and solidarity with several of my friends who benefit from the resources offered by the Women’s Center, LGBTQ Resource Center and the CMEA,” Murday wrote in an email. “These centers should be a point of pride for Georgetown, not a point of contention.”
GUSA Undersecretary for LGBTQ Affairs Lexi Dever (COL ’16) also attended the event, and said that Olson welcomed conversation with students.
“I, along with a number of other students from GUSA, GU Pride, the Queer Women’s Collective and other groups directly affected by any changes to the centers, went in order to directly express our need for the basic structure of the centers to remain unchanged,” Dever wrote in an email. “Dr. Olson and Dennis Williams were quite responsive to our concerns, allowing a strong conversation to develop between the students and the administrators about what should be done to benefit the Georgetown community the most.”
Jayme Amann (COL ’15), a Women Advancing Gender Equity fellow in the Women’s Center and the ally representative on the GU Pride executive board, said that that the idea belittles each group’s unique and individual identity.
“Stop trying to marginalize these groups of people at Georgetown just because heterosexual male white privilege dominates the university administration,” Amann wrote in an email addressing the university. “It’s offensive and belittles the struggle groups represented by these three centers face on a daily basis. If this is about minimizing bureaucracy, the university could have found a heck of a lot better outlet.”

Thank god for the students of Georgetown, because the administration’s will to mediocrity seems overwhelming sometimes. 
This consolidation is obviously a terrible idea. I would welcome the consolidation of Dr. Olson’s office with Facilities, though.

Two months after unarmed teenager Michael Brown was shot by a police officer, 17 Georgetown students travelled to Ferguson, Mo., for the Ferguson October march last weekend, participating in teach-ins and other protests against police brutality and racism.
The students reflected on their experiences during the “Weekend of Resistance” at a discussion group hosted by the Black Leadership Forum, Center for Social Justice, and Program on Justice and Peace in the Intercultural Center on Monday.
GU NAACP President Mikaela Ferrill (COL ’15), who went on the trip, said that she was moved by the solidarity between different groups of protesters.
“Being in the march on Sunday with people of different types of abilities, colors, genders, ages — that was really, really important,” Ferrill said. “I’ve always been interested in coalition building. … One of the best parts of my weekend was seeing solidarity in action.”
The trip was funded by the CSJ and the Office Affirmative Action Programs. The marchers also received about $1,000 in donations through fundraising efforts in Red Square. Participation was open to anyone who wanted to attend.
The weekend of resistance was a part of Ferguson October, a series of protests, marches and panels hosted by Hands Up United, Organization for Black Struggle and Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment. Forty-nine participants were arrested during the weekend.
The Georgetown participants belonged to the Georgetown chapter of the NAACP, Black Student Alliance, Program on Justice and Peace, Patrick Healy Fellowship, Georgetown Solidarity Committee and United Feminists.
Michael Martin (COL ’17) said that he went on the trip in order to gain a better understanding of the situation in Ferguson and to express his frustrations.
“The amount of energy and passion the people of Ferguson had and put together as a community was amazing, it was sort of inspirational,” Martin wrote in an email. “Now I want to make sure my peers and I bring back that same energy and passion and help to educate the students of Georgetown about the seriousness of police brutality in America and how it is detrimental to our society.”
LaDarius Torrey (COL ’17) also said that the trip widened his perspective on racism and police brutality.
“Being there made me realize just how serious and real the issues of the American structure are,” Torrey said. “From that standpoint, it’s greatly disheartening. After coming back from Ferguson, I personally feel obligated to continue to combat injustices and strive for true equality and unity as well.”
Attendee Crystal Walker (SFS ’16) said that she was both inspired by the commitment of the protestors and amazed at the rift between the citizens of Ferguson and the police.
“People are trying to give the police the benefit of the doubt, but in reality I spoke to people who have been there for over 20 years,” Walker said. “There has always been pressure between us and the police, and I feel like Mike Brown’s death was the last point.”
Walker said she was impressed and humbled by those who continued to protest, regardless of poor weather conditions.
“It’s so great to see people who’ve been out there every single night. … It was cold the night we were there and people were still out there, it rains and people are still out there, it’s going to snow soon and people will still be out there,” Walker said. “I think that’s what’s so powerful about Ferguson, that this was the last straw.”
David Ragland, a visiting assistant professor of education at Bucknell University, spoke at Monday’s event and focused on the necessity of solidarity. Ragland discussed the links between different social justice issues and the situation in Ferguson.
“People’s identities are constantly violated, there’s police brutality, the school-to-prison pipeline,” Ragland said. “We see large movements like the ecological movement connected to what’s happening in Ferguson, because who are the first people who are victims of climate change? Poor folks. People of color.”
Ragland said that he was moved by the chants spoken by the protestors.
“I think it’s important for us to see all of the structural violence as unjust but also at root a violation of human dignity,” Ragland said. “One of the chants that stuck with me when I was out there was ‘The whole damn system is guilty as hell.’ We are really all complicit.”
Ayo Aruleba (COL ’17), who also attended the march, said that a powerful moment during the weekend was when the group of protestors addressed Ferguson police.
“One of the chants that resonated with me was, ‘Tell me what democracy looks like. This is what democracy looks like.’ Having the opportunity to stand outside the Ferguson police department … to tell them how we feel about the structure, speak to police officers themselves made me appreciate democracy more,” Aruleba said.
Michael Martin (COL ’17), expressed disappointment at the lack of knowledge on the situation in Ferguson that his peers revealed after his return to campus.
“It was amazing seeing all the people in Ferguson coming out to all of these events … to be with people with the same values,” Martin said. “Then you come back to Georgetown, and these are people who could potentially be leading the world one day. … We had these signs in our hands that we got at the protests, and as we were in the elevator [of LXR], this kid comes up to me and he’s like ‘Oh, who’s Mike Brown?’”
CSJ Executive Director Andria Wisler responded to Martin’s desire to spread knowledge on the issue on campus by relating it to Georgetown’s Jesuit values. She said she encouraged the students to talk about their experiences in Ferguson in all of their classes in order to spread awareness.
“Something I learned that’s very Jesuit, is to give people the benefit of the doubt,” Wisler said. “St. Ignatius talked about this idea, that if people don’t know about something that you care a lot about, you have to meet them there and you have to meet them with love. You give them the benefit of the doubt, and the fact of what you’re saying … You meet them and you tell them what it is.”

An organization called Hoyas United for Free Speech created a petition addressed to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson calling for extensive reform to the university’s Free Speech and Expression Policy on Wednesday night.
As of Thursday night, the petition had received over 150 student and faculty signatures, according to H*yas for Choice President Abby Grace (SFS ’16), who is also a member of HUFS. The petition will remain active for two weeks before the group sends it to Olson.
HUFS, which was formed to create this petition, involves around 30 students from a variety of campus groups, including but not limited to H*yas for Choice, Georgetown Solidarity Committee, GU Pride and GU Fossil Free. A number of unaffiliated students are also involved in HUFS.
According to a release from HUFS that accompanied the petition Wednesday night, the petition was created in response to oppression of free speech on campus. The press release cited the Georgetown University Police Department’s removal of H*yas for Choice from a public sidewalk outside of the university’s front gates on 37th and O streets on Sept. 22 as they held a peaceful protest of the university’s bestowment of an honorary degree upon Donald Cardinal Wuerl.
“In light of recent decisions made by university officials to systematically suppress substantive speech, we have decided to take concrete action to reform Georgetown’s existing Speech and Expression Policy,” the release read.
The petition states that the current Speech and Expression Policy is often ambiguously interpreted by administrators, leading to an inconsistency in implementation.
“The Speech and Expression policy’s vague language allows university officials to interpret policy in a manner that suits their immediate needs rather than applying a consistent standard; in addition, it often leaves members of the university community unsure about what rights they have,” the petition stated.
The HUFS’s petition lists seven demands for the university: eventually eliminating specified Free Speech Zones on campus, immediately expanding these zones to sidewalks in front of Healy Hall and around Healy Circle, recruiting a more diverse group of campus speakers for events, preserving and expanding safe spaces such as the LGBTQ Resource Center, Women’s Center and CMEA, creating a funding system for American Sign Language interpretation and Communication Access Real-Time captioning at events for deaf and hard-of-hearing community members, removing tables used by student groups from the list of “permanent structures” in the Speech and Expression Policy and creating new academic courses that highlight underrepresented viewpoints on campus.
Under the university’s current Speech and Expression Policy, students can only set up tables in designated Free Speech Zones which include Red Square, Regents Lawn, the Healey Family Student Center and the lobby of the Leavey Center. Before the policy was updated in May, tabling was limited to Red Square, with the lobby of the Leavey Center designated as an alternative spot to table during poor weather conditions.
The Academic Resource Center denied requests to fund a sign language interpreter at a Georgetown University Student Association-sponsored LSAT prep course in the spring.
H*yas for Choice Vice President Vincent DeLaurentis (SFS ’17), who helped create HUFS, said he became involved in response to his experiences with speech suppression.
“As a member of H*yas for Choice who has experienced active speech suppression during my short time at Georgetown, I wanted to see more students standing up for substantive speech on campus,” DeLaurentis wrote in an email.
According to DeLaurentis, HUFS hopes to inspire change in the Speech and Expression Policy as well as in the culture on campus.
“The first is to have the demands in our petition, which are essential for free and substantive speech, met by university officials,” DeLaurentis wrote. “The second is to foster a culture, both among university officials and the student body that truly seeks to celebrate free and open dialogue, rather than repressing or tolerating student expression.”
According to DeLaurentis, whether or not HUFS takes future action will depend upon the university’s response to the petition.
Olson said he learned of the petition Thursday and hopes to work with students to develop solutions.
“It looks like many of these topics have been discussed in some depth, or will be discussed soon, in our Speech and Expression Committee, our ongoing diversity work with students and the recently launched Disability Justice Working Group,” Olson wrote in an email. “I look forward to continued engagement with students on these important topics.”
Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) said that although GUSA was not involved in the creation of HUFS, it supports the group’s actions.
“It shows that there still is some work that needs to be done, and it’s great that students are coming together to address it,” Jikaria said. “I really think it shows the administration that there are steps that need to be taken.”

Biology and psychology professor Janet Mann received the Animal Welfare Institute’s Christine Stevens Wildlife Award, a $10,000 grant that will help fund her research on hormone monitoring in cetaceans, an order which includes marine mammals such as dolphins, whales and porpoises.
According to wildlife biologist DJ Schubert, a member of the AWI, a group of judges selected five finalists to receive grants out of a pool of 34 applicants.
“The Christine Stevens Wildlife Award has two areas of focus: one is on the development of humane and non-invasive methods for resolving wildlife conflicts while the second focus is on the development of non-invasive and humane strategies to study wildlife,” Schubert said. “Dr. Mann’s proposal falls into the second category.”
The award, named after the AWI’s late founder and president of over 50 years, honors those whose research aims at developing humane strategies for wildlife conflict management.
Mann’s latest research focuses on measuring the levels of cortisol, a primary stress hormone, detected in the respiratory vapor that is exhaled from a dolphin’s blowhole. Mann is studying the connection between stress and animal illnesses. She conducts much of her research at Shark Bay, a World Heritage Site in Australia, where she has been working for almost 30 years.
“I am very interested in trying to understand why many dolphin populations around the world are suffering .… Off the coast of Virginia last year, a lot of bottlenose dolphins washed up dead and it turned out that it was this disease Morbillivirus which can kill thousands, or even tens of thousands of dolphins a year,” Mann said. “So I am very interested in disease transmission because that can suddenly wipe out a population.”
Chronic stress in cetaceans can be caused by a variety of stimuli, such as pollution, a lack of prey or a loud shipping noise. According to Schubert, most stressors are anthropogenic.
“Collecting stress data on wild dolphins using a non-invasive methodology can provide important information required for the proper conservation and management of dolphin stocks particularly those subjected to anthropogenic impacts and stressors including from cetacean watching activities but also from other forms of recreation, industrial development and ocean noise impacts” Schubert said.
Mann has also worked with the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Md., since 1992. Mann works to collect samples of blow that reveal DNA and hormone levels in cetaceans. The research has encouraged the aquarium to make changes that will lower stress levels in its dolphins; it is considering establishing a dolphin sanctuary and has already stopped its dolphin trick shows.
“The benefits of doing this work is potentially developing a noninvasive stress test for animals in captivity or in aquaria so we could see what we’re doing is not freaking them out,” Mann said. “[We are] applying that to the wild so that we understand our impact on the animals and their environments in addition to their natural stressors.”
Caitlin Karniski (GRD ’19), Mann’s research associate, said that the depth of Mann’s experience in marine biology makes her a good professor.
“What’s really incredible is how well she knows these animals, not just from a species perspective but on an individual level as well,” Karniski said. “Since she has been encountering the same individuals in Shark Bay for almost 30 years now, when she comes across a dolphin on the boat she can instantly know their entire life history, all the important events that have happened throughout their lifetime, she can recall it down to the day.”
Karniski said Mann’s teachings have inspired her to examine this particular field of science in a new light.
“[Mann] and the work she has done has completely opened my eyes up to an entirely new set of questions that you can ask about biology, conservation and evolutionary biology,” Karniski said. “The wealth of knowledge she has is amazing.”
Mann said she hopes her research can help students learn about their impact on the environment and how they can help make changes.
“I feel like this is our planet, and it’s particularly the students’ planet. All the things we have messed up on the planet, you are inheriting,” Mann said. “I think that it’s really important that students are aware of what their impact is on the environment.”

Rabbi Barry Freundel, an Orthodox Jewish rabbi for the Georgetown neighborhood’s Kesher Israel congregation who taught at the Georgetown University Law Center and other local universities, was arrested on charges of voyeurism Tuesday.
Freundel allegedly installed a recording device in the women’s mikvah, a private ritual bath, at the Kesher Israel Orthodox synagogue, located at 2801 N St. He pled not guilty to six counts of voyeurism in D.C. Superior Court on Wednesday.
Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson Gwendolyn Crump said the case is still under investigation.
According to GULC spokesperson Elissa Free, Freundel has served as an adjunct law professor at the Georgetown University Law Center since the early 1990s, teaching a seminar on Jewish law, but is not teaching this semester. Free did not specify when Freundel last taught at the university.
According to the MPD police report, a 35-year-old female observed Freundel installing the recording device Sept. 28, which was in the form of a black radio clock called a Dream Machine. Freundel stated that he was using the clock radio for ventilation in the shower. The Washington Post reported that police found recordings of six women on two separate dates in 2014.
Freundel, 62, has been suspended without pay from the synagogue and from his position as the Rav Hamachshir, overseer of the mikvah.
“This is a painful moment for Kesher Israel Congregation and the entire Jewish community. At this challenging time, we draw strength from our faith, our tradition, and our fellow congregants,” the synagogue’s board of directors said in a statement. “Upon receiving information regarding potentially inappropriate activity, the board of directors quickly alerted the appropriate officials. Throughout the investigation, we cooperated fully with law enforcement and will continue to do so.”
Gabi Rubin (COL ’15), former president and current social chair of the Jewish Students Association, described the mikvah as a private, reflective spiritual experience for both Jewish men and women. Mikvahs are often used by Orthodox Jewish women each month after their menstrual cycles, as well as by converts and by brides and grooms before the wedding.
“It’s a time to look into yourself and to better understand yourself and reflect on your relationship with God,” Rubin said. “It’s a place for ritual reflection and renewal.”
She said that the mikvah is about purity, and that it should never be sexualized.
“It’s a very personal, very individual, entirely non-sexual experience when you are with yourself and looking at yourself as you are. You’re naked, in the way that you would when you bathe, but it’s more of a nakedness of spirit and of body,” she said.
In addition to his role as rabbi and past position as a Georgetown professor, Freundel is also vice president of the Vaad, a council of rabbis, in Washington, D.C., and formerly led the Rabbinical Council of America, a national organization of Orthodox rabbis, in addition to serving as a consultant on ethics to the National Institutes of Health.
The judge ordered that he be released from custody until his hearing Nov. 12.

Enhanced entry screening for the Ebola virus began at Washington-Dulles International Airport on Thursday, along with four other airports, in an attempt by the Centers for Disease Control to thwart the spread of Ebola into the United States.
University Professor Lawrence Gostin, who specializes in global health law, criticized the efficacy of the screenings on Minnesota Public Radio on Oct. 8. Gostin also directs the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law and was the Founding O’Neill Chair in Global Health Law.
“I think that what the CDC has done for airport screening is reasonable and the most moderate they could have done. It’s well targeted, and I think it’s a very measured response,” Gostin told The Hoya. “But will it work? Probably not.”
Ebola screenings began at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport Saturday, and Chicago’s O’Hare International, Newark Liberty International and Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International joined them Thursday.
There have been eight cases of Ebola in the United States. Thomas Eric Duncan, the first reported Ebola patient in the United States, left Liberia on Sept. 19 on a Brussels Airline jet to Belgium. From there, he flew to Dulles International, and spent three hours there on a layover, before flying into Dallas. Duncan died Oct. 8.
“We work to continuously increase the safety of Americans,” CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a press release last Wednesday. “We believe these new measures will further protect the health of Americans, understanding that nothing we can do will get us to absolute zero risk until we end the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.”
These five airports account for over 94 percent of travellers from the Ebola-impacted countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Travellers from the affected countries will be taken aside to a separate screening area, where trained staff from Customs and Border Patrol will check them for signs of sickness.
These travellers will also be questioned about any potential exposure to the virus, and any indication of Ebola-like symptoms or possible encounters with the disease will result in transfer to a quarantined area for further evaluation.
Gostin cited the historical failings of fever monitoring, particularly during the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, outbreak of 2002 to 2003, as precedent for the failure of screenings. The SARS outbreak started in southern China and spread to infect individuals in 37 other countries, including the United States. Hundreds of thousands of travellers were monitored and not a single SARS case was found.
He said that it is possible that symptoms resembling Ebola may result in false positives, wasting resources that could otherwise be used to combat the real threat.
“I’m afraid that this will distract a lot of resources and attention from the real problem,” Gostin said. “This could burden the CDC, as well as state and local health departments and emergency rooms.”
John Kraemer (LAW ’08), professor of health systems administration at Georgetown and a Scholar at the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, was also skeptical of airport screening.
“That sort of assessment will not catch every potential case. People will still be asymptomatic and in the incubation period at the time they go through screening,” he said.
In addition to screenings, House Republicans also called for a travel ban from West Africa in an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on Ebola Thursday.
Gostin vigorously disagreed with a travel ban, arguing that it would prevent aid from reaching the affected countries.
“I think a travel ban would make us much more at risk. What it would do is exacerbate the epidemic in West Africa, and the more that that epidemic rages out of control, the more risk there is of international spread,” Gostin said.
Kraemer, who also opposed a travel ban, admitted that despite its potential inefficacies, airport screening was one of the best available options.
“A travel ban would be highly counterproductive, and something like biologic screening would be logistically very difficult,” he said. “Airport screening is essentially the best option available under the circumstances.”
Instead of focusing on prevention within the United States, Gostin said that it is essential that the government increase the scope of its response in West Africa, which he criticized as inadequate.
“The surest way to prevent cases in the United States is to root out infection at the source,” he said. “It’s been a very flawed and failed effort in West Africa.”
Kraemer echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the far more serious epidemic in Africa.
“Everybody should be allocating significantly more resources to control the outbreak in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea,” he said. “In the United States, Ebola may kill a very small number of people. It is quickly becoming catastrophic in those countries.”
The much-publicized death of Thomas Eric Duncan at Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas, as well as the failure of the hospital to ensure the safety of staff and other patients, has led many to criticize the United States’ ability to handle Ebola. Most hospitals are ill-equipped for controlling the disease and are susceptible to breaches in protocol.
“Dallas exposed a soft underbelly of American vulnerability in our health system,” Gostin said. “We’ve cut our funding for the CDC, we’ve cut our funding for state and local health departments and we have enormous deficiency in our response capabilities.”
Despite this seemingly grim outlook, Kraemer said that Ebola does not pose a significant threat to the United States.
“The likelihood of significant community transmission is very small,” Kraemer said. “You don’t see significant outbreaks of Ebola anyplace that has a functioning health care system.”

With Monday’s release of a relatio post disceptationem document, the Vatican has advanced its position of support for gay and lesbian Catholics. Vatican officials updated the original document Thursday, however, revising the English translation of the document to read “providing for homosexual persons” from the original “welcoming homosexual persons.” The Italian version remains unchanged.
Released by a gathering of Catholic bishops at the Vatican, the document shows a shift toward increased inclusion of non-traditional families within the Catholic Church. The report came at the midpoint of the gathering, also called a synod, convened by Pope Francis to discuss the situation of the family in the world today.
In its most notable shift, the report calls for the church to accept same-sex couples into its religious community, the first time the church acknowledged positive aspects of such relationships.
“Homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer to the Christian community,” the report said. “There are instances where mutual assistance to the point of sacrifice is a valuable support in the life of these persons.”
The document also expresses approval of aspects of unmarried partnership and calls for reflection on attitudes toward those who have divorced and remarried.
“Not to be overlooked, though, is the attention that the synod gave to the stresses on married families today, with special emphasis — not surprisingly with Pope Francis — on the pressures of poverty on families, as well as the need to prepare couples for marriage and the need to accompany couples as they go through their marriage,” Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., said.
Pointing to the prominent use of the words “mercy” and “accompany” throughout the report, O’Brien explained that the document called upon the church to accompany all its members along the principle of gradualness.
“There is an ideal in the moral life. Sometimes people — which is most of us — struggle to reach the ideal. Therefore the best thing for a church to do is to accompany people as they are striving to reach their ideal and not exclude or condemn them on the way to that ideal,” he said.
The document, called a relatio post disceptationem, Latin for “report after debate,” was unorthodox in that it does not represent the final decision of the gathering but rather summarizes the contentious discussion until the point of its release. After the formal reading of the report at the Vatican, 41 bishops responded, prompting disagreement and contention among them.
“There is a lot of disagreement among the bishops about how to proceed. Pope Francis is not afraid of argument or disagreement. He allows different voices to be heard. Ultimately, he will issue a final report, but he is in no rush to get there,” O’Brien said.
Thomas Farr, the director of the Religious Freedom Project at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, joined about 50 signatories in signing Commitment to Marriage, a letter to the Vatican in opposition to same-sex marriage. The letter addressed several threats to traditional marriage, speaking out against pornography, divorce and cohabitation. It also called for the Vatican to “restore any legal provisions that protect marriage as a conjugal union of one man and one woman, entered into with an openness to the gift of children, and lived faithfully and permanently as the foundation of the natural family.”
He said that the Vatican’s document does not reflect changing ideology, only an active discussion.
“There is very little here that is new other than emphasis and tone,” Farr told Newsweek.
Despite the progress, O’Brien predicted the report would spark tension, regardless of the final result.
“There will be clarity given, and I think that clarity will end up disappointing many, whatever side one comes from, because the tension we face here is that we are trying to maintain the church’s tradition while updating it, while helping that doctrine meet the needs of the people of God today,” he said.
GU Pride Media Manager and Historian Campbell James (SFS ’17) said that, despite the recent change in language, the document still represented a positive step forward.
“I think there’s still an overall positive message that gay people can give a great deal of value to the Christian and Catholic community, but it seemed like they tried not to be so radical in this version of it,” James said.
He applauded the move forward but hoped for further inclusion from the church.
“The eventual recognition of same-sex marriage would just be incredible. That’s not necessarily to say they have to perform these marriages, but it would be fantastic for them to recognize them and treat same-sex couples with the same value of straight couples,” James said.
The release of the document coincides with OUTober, a cultural heritage month which celebrates LGBTQ students at Georgetown. As the report attempts to reconcile Catholicism with evolving identities of the modern Catholic congregation, James named the Georgetown community as crucial to the event’s success.
“What I think is really cool about OUTober is that we have the support of all of Georgetown and all of Georgetown’s offices, including Campus Ministry,” he said. “It’s really cool to think that Georgetown has taken specifically the Jesuit value cura personalis, and applied that to taking care of all Georgetown students and meet Georgetown students where they need to be met. … And Campus Ministry backs us up wholeheartedly on that.”

To provide safe transit for women and LGBTQ individuals in the District, Collective Action for Safe Spaces, a grassroots organization in Washington, D.C., that aims to build a community free from public sexual harassment and assault, will launch its new program RightRides D.C. on Halloween night.
The ride service will operate from 11:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. with three donated cars from ZipCar driven by volunteers who have undergone serious background checks and a two-hour training session. Focusing on a locus of U Street NW, the service will extend from Rock Creek Park to the intersection of Bladensburg Road and South Dakota Avenue NE but will not operate in the southeast and southwest quadrants of the city.
RightRides D.C. Coordinator Zosia Sztykowski explained that the organization had noticed a need for safe transportation options particularly late at night.
“[It happens] on the metro system and on buses and every once in a while there would be something that would happen in a cab or an Uber. It’s people that were just getting from point A to point B as they were walking down the street were being targeted in some way,” Sztykowski said. “We knew that our community needed a transportation option that was safe and affordable.”
If successful, RightRides D.C. hopes to continue to offer the free service on other holidays and throughout the entire city. Riders on Halloween will be encouraged to give feedback about preferred holidays and times.
“For next year we have a goal of running the program every Saturday night and it’s going to take a lot of resources to get us there,” Sztykowski said. “Another really important goal of ours is to expand the surface area to all four quadrants of D.C.”
The idea for the RightRides D.C. program was inspired by New York City’s RightRides for Women’s Safety that launched in 2004.
“One way we saw the need for the program was from our blog which collects stories of things that happen in the D.C. metro area involving public sexual harassment and gendered violence,” Sztykowski said. The program has received positive feedback from activists and allies in the District.
“I think it’s great, especially I think it is for those students who are gender non-conforming or trans students who are often getting the most harassed,” LGBTQ Resource Center Director Shiva Subbaraman said.
Halloween night can create a high-risk environment, as community members often dress up and stay out late.
“I feel like some people don’t get to do what they really want to do for Halloween for fear that when they are waiting for a taxi that they could be beaten up or harassed for the way they are dressed,” GU Pride First Year Representative Anthony Anderson (COL ’18) said. “Especially with the recent attack that happened at Georgetown it can be really scary to be out at night.”
While RightRides D.C. will offer a safer transportation service for women and LGBTQ individuals, Women’s Center Director Laura Kovach noted that further action to create a more welcoming community and to address the root problems of harassment is needed.
“It is important that we address safety with women and LGBTQ communities, but we must also make sure that we are not silencing survivors and all of our communities by only saying that women and LGBTQ individuals need to think about safety,” Kovach wrote in an email. “We need perpetrators to not harass and rape first and foremost. Then we should focus on safety as a community effort so that we can hold perpetrators accountable.”
Sztykowski agreed, pointing to programming and campaigns organized by CASS on making D.C. a safer community for all.
“RightRides D.C. just fills this gap for the time being and all the rest of Collective Action programming really deals with this idea of creating a community that is safe for everyone all the time in a variety of different ways,” Sztykowski said. “Even though our goal is to expand the program now, our number one top goal is to make the program irrelevant.”

Despite a population of 155,000 students enrolled across the 12 universities and two colleges in the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area, only between 650 and 700 students participate in cross-registration each semester, amounting to a participation rate of between 0.41 percent and 0.45 percent.
Students at member universities are eligible to cross-register by enrolling in classes at other member schools in the program, meant to give students an opportunity to branch out in their scholarly endeavors and experience other academic institutions.
“No university can possibly offer every conceivable course, so cross-registration opens many other avenues,” Consortium President and CEO John Cavanaugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The universities and colleges in the Washington consortium include American University, The Catholic University of America, Gallaudet University, George Mason University, The George Washington University, Georgetown University, Howard University, Marymount University, National Intelligence University, National Defense University, Trinity Washington University, University of the District of Columbia and the University of Maryland, College Park.
This semester, 32 Georgetown graduate students and 22 undergraduate students are enrolled in consortium courses at other schools, while 50 graduate and students 123 undergraduate students from other schools are taking consortium classes at Georgetown. One hundred and ninety-seven and 195 students were enrolled in classes at Georgetown through the consortium in fall 2013 and spring 2014 semesters, respectively. A total of 39 Georgetown students cross-registered through the Consortium last fall and a total of 43 Georgetown students did so in the spring.
“From what I hear from students, the excellent opportunities are not as well-known as they could be,” Cavanaugh wrote.
By contrast, though it includes fewer members,  Five College Consortium, a consortium of five colleges in or around Amherst, Mass., has about 6,000 students who participate in cross-registration, according to its website. There are approximately 36,500 undergraduate students in the Five College Consortium, which amounts to a participation rate of around 16 percent, over 39 times higher than the Washington consortium’s participation rate. Students in the Reserve Officer Training Corps are more likely to take advantage of cross-registration within the consortium, according to School of Foreign Service Director of Undergraduate Program Mitch Kaneda.
In the Washington, D.C. area, Georgetown is the host school for the Army ROTC, named the Hoya Battalion. There are 134 cadets currently enrolled in the Army ROTC, 27 of whom are Georgetown students, according to Army ROTC Director Lt. Col. Michael Donahue.
Since the Army ROTC program is housed at Georgetown, students from the other participating schools — GWU, CUA, American and Marymount — usually have to travel to Georgetown for required military classes.
“We’re just very fortunate that there is the consortium so it is very easy for a George Washington student to enroll in a class here at Georgetown University,” Donahue said. “Across the country a host program, for instance at the University of Pittsburgh, would also have ROTC students out of Carnegie Mellon and Duquesne, but there may not be a consortium that sort of unites them academically.”
One hundred and four of the 174 visiting students enrolled at Georgetown this semester are in the Army ROTC program.
Aside from fulfilling ROTC requirements, students opt to take part in the consortium’s cross-registration program because they have already fulfilled their major requirements and want to explore other areas of interest that are not offered at Georgetown, according to Patricia Grant, the senior assistant dean of undergraduate programs at the McDonough School of Business.
“Students are rarely doing it to expand their social network and meet other people on other campuses or see what it’s like to take a course at another campus,” Grant said. “They’re more so doing it because they have a free elective space in their curriculum and they have no requirements.”
Students who are interested in registering in a class at another Washington consortium university can do so by requesting that class through their dean. The dean’s office will then work with the registrar’s office to register the student at the other school.
“We are fortunate to be in a metropolitan area with several higher education institutions. When our students identify an opportunity at a consortium university, we work with them to determine its feasibility and, if so, provide our support,” Douglas Little, the senior assistant dean and director of academic affairs at the School of Nursing and Health Studies, wrote in an email.
Zach Highley-Gergel, a GWU junior, took organic chemistry at Georgetown over the summer through the consortium. Highley-Gergel had missed the start of the class at GWU, after studying abroad in the United Kingdom.
“Actually getting into the consortium and starting it was a bit of a pain because of the actual paper writing and stuff like that,” Highley-Gergel said. “But once I was actually in it, it was great. I was integrated as a normal student, classes were good, the lab was good.”
Highley-Gergel said that a setback in his consortium experience was that he did not have access to Georgetown facilities and resources.
“The only annoying thing was I wasn’t allowed a GOCard. And because of not being allowed a GOCard, I couldn’t access some of the things like the library, and I think one or two other places,” Highley-Gergel said.
Aside from cross-registration, the consortium offers a number of other programs such as the Consortium Research Fellows Program for graduate students in certain areas of psychology and computer science and joint library services.
“[The Washington consortium is] a resource that many college students just don’t have,” Grant said. “And so we are pleased that it is something that the Georgetown student can take advantage of if it’s in their academic plan and need.”

CLAIRE SOISSON/THE HOYAThe Washington Canoe Club at 3700 Water St. NW
Two buildings in the Georgetown neighborhood received spots on the 2014 Most Endangered Places list released late last week by the D.C. Preservation League.
The D.C. Preservation League aims to encourage preservation of D.C.’s historic buildings.
“The 2014 list of Most Endangered Places represents some of the challenges that historic resources face in our city. These include proposed excessive and incompatible development that threatens some of our city’s most precious resources; willful demolition by neglect; and financial hardship, which creates obstacles for owners who strive to do the right thing,” Executive Director of the D.C. Preservation League Rebecca Miller said in a press release.
The Washington Canoe Club, located at 3700 Water St. NW, and the West Heating Plant, located at 1051 29th St. NW, both in Georgetown, were designated by the league as endangered, in addition to four other locations across the District: the Anacostia Commercial Corridor, 911 and 913 L Street NW, the Carnegie Library and St. Elizabeth’s East Agricultural Complex.
The D.C. Preservation League includes buildings on the list that are “historically, culturally and architecturally significant,” but have been abandoned or neglected, which could potentially result in alterations or demolitions to the structures. It released the first list in 1996.
Ad:
The Washington Canoe Club, which also made the list in 2012, is an iconic D.C. site. The boathouse, which is over a hundred years old, is one of only two boathouses remaining in the District.
“This building is a real iconic D.C. image,” Andrew Soles, president of the Washington Canoe Club, said. “You’ll often see it in photographs of Georgetown from across the river. … It’s not the Washington Monument, but it’s an incredibly significant piece of Washington, D.C.”
However, the building has not been renovated since its construction in 1904 and recently has experienced a lack of funding and proper upkeep. The building is structurally unsound, with its windows and roofs requiring either repair or replacement. The National Park Service declared most of the boathouse unfit for occupancy in 2010. Since then, the approximately 200 members of the club have been forced to utilize a portion of the original building that is still operational.
Soles explained that the WCC is currently working on plans to renovate the boathouse to its original state. The renovations are estimated to cost around $5 million and could be completed by 2020.
“It’s going to take more than the efforts of just the 200 Washington Canoe Club members to restore it,” Soles said. “What we’re really hoping is to engage the greater D.C. community who, as I say, see this as an iconic building in the D.C. landscape.”
The other Georgetown building on the list, the West Heating Plant, dates back to the 1940s and provided steam for the District’s federal offices until 2000. The building, a behemoth of brick reaching six stories into the sky, currently sits empty on a prime space of real estate off of the C&O Canal.
The property was sold to a group of developers for $19.5 million in March 2013 and is at risk of being significantly modified to make room for approximately 80 condominiums, expected to be the most expensive condos in the District. However, as the West Heating Plant sits in the historic district of Old Georgetown, the proposal requires the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts to be consulted before alterations can be made.
Additionally, Thomas Luebke, secretary of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, pointed to serious structural problems in the building that would likely prevent serious refurbishment or alternations.
“The building has some significant issues in terms of whether it could be preserved or not and to what extent,” Luebke said. “The quandary for redevelopment is, can you use the building which is essentially an enormous box which doesn’t really have floors in it?”
Current plans call for the demolition of more than 65 percent of the building. Only one side of the facade would remain intact during refurbishment while the rest of the building would be taken down to the foundation. Peter Jost, the president of the Foundation for the Preservation of Historic Georgetown, said there would be tension between the preservationists and the realists in terms of what to do with the West Heating Plant.
“There are some preservationists who think nothing should be done to it — it’s beautiful the way it is,” Jost said. “Obviously other people think it should be turned into a usable building. In order to turn it into a usable building it has to go through significant modifications, which I think would change how it looks today. And you have two camps on that. The preservationist or realist realizes that to keep something of the building you have to make some concessions.”
According to Luebke, the Old Georgetown Board will review the issue and issue a report on the structural integrity of the building at a meeting Nov. 6.

Contributors to the new book “Human Dignity and the Future of Global Institutions” discussed the role of human dignity in a changing international environment filled with a proliferation of new international actors in a panel hosted by the masters of science in foreign service program, the Mortara Center for International Studies and the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs in the Lohrfink Auditorium on Thursday evening.
“The one thing that we have seen in the international system is a change, a proliferation in the international actors. Clearly states still exist in the international system but we have seen a proliferation of intergovernmental organizations, nongovernmental organizations [and] substate actors,” co-editor and MSFS director Anthony Clark Arend (SFS ’80) said.
According to the book, this changing international environment should be addressed by a focus on human dignity.
“The fundamental thesis of the book is that human dignity should serve as the guiding principle for all these institutions. It should serve as the touchstone as these institutions, as varied as they may be, try to carry on their work,” Arend said.
According to Arend, the key to a new emphasis in human dignity is starting up a conversation.
“We then end the book with a plea. The plea is to take this concept of human dignity, to take this book as a starting point, to seek to promote what we call a dignitarian dialogue,” Arend.
The authors said that it is difficult to sustain reform for human dignity and rights’ issues because of disagreements about implementations, not because of a lack of a consensus on the general ideas.
“What we recognized in a sense is that it has always been easier to get countries, organizations, groups to agree to concepts than it has been to get enforcement. After all, no one wants to have to answer positively to the question, have you stopped beating your wife yet?” SFS professor Ambassador Don McHenry, the former U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations from 1979 to 1981, said.
McHenry recognized that this issue is at the center of the book.
“The writers have sought to wrestle with not just the concepts of human rights and human dignity, not just the way in which we can get people on the same label in terms of what we are talking about, but they have sought to wrestle with the implementation and the problems which arise,” McHenry said.
The panel also discussed the role of the United States in shaping the conversation regarding human dignity.
“It is too coy to suggest that the United States should stand back and not be a vigorous promoter of human dignity. It shouldn’t take over the dialogue but as there will be suspicion that human dignity is somehow a Trojan horse for the U.S. ways of doing things, it should be a cultivator, not a hegemonic player,” said co-editor Ambassador Mark Lagon, the chair for global politics and security and professor in the practice of international affairs.
The authors said that they chose to speak more about human dignity rather than human rights because of the fundamental cross-culture concept of human dignity.

Critically acclaimed Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who has delivered notable TED talks — including one sampled by Beyoncé — spoke about issues of race, gender and the creative writing process with African Studies Director Scott Taylor in Gaston Hall on Friday.
The event was sponsored by the African Society, the African Studies Program, English department, Lecture Fund, Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Justice, the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and the Offices of the President and Provost.
University President John J. DeGioia gave a brief introduction to the award-winning writer’s many works, the most recent of which, “Americanah,” was released last year. Adichie was also recognized for her outspoken advocacy for gender equality.
During her talk, Adichie criticized the label of “African literature” and its specific accompanying accolades.
“To be prescriptive is to constrain. I think the problem arises that whoever uses the label has an ideal of what an African writer should be and should write about,” she said. “These labels have less to do with literary merit and art. They’re political considerations.”
Adichie has published three novels and has won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction and the Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize for Fiction.
Adichie went on to warn aspiring writers against considering the potential audience of the work.
“When you consider who’s going to be reading your work, you censor yourself,” she said. “Looking at my career in particular, if I had been thinking about audience and marketing, I probably wouldn’t have done what I’ve done.”
Adichie also spoke about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and criticized the American media’s coverage of it.
“It just goes back to this common idea that Africa is a place where people apply a different kind of logic,” Adichie said. “If Ebola was happening somewhere other than Africa, I don’t know if this level of hysteria would exist.”
A reception in Riggs Library followed the event.
During the reception, Adichie discussed misperceptions surrounding Western feminism.
“Feminism isn’t about saying that women shouldn’t be at home. It’s saying that women should have home as well as other choices that are equal and equally possible,” she explained. “It comes from a lack of par. If we have women who have degrees that they need and know they can get the job they’re qualified for, then they choose to stay at home, then there’s no pressure. Many women don’t have that choice.”
Zoe Gadegbeku (COL ’15), president of the African Society of Georgetown, said that she found Adichie’s comments on feminism to be very relevant.
“Her comments on feminism and the ways in which young girls are socialized to be subordinate to men especially struck a chord with me because she is so unafraid and unapologetic in asserting herself,” Gadegbeku said. “The idea of being unapologetic is a powerful one, in the sense that people should be brave in pursuing endeavors they are passionate about. I believe that’s especially important to us as college students who face intense pressure to pursue a very specific path to success.”
Ayo Aruleba (COL ’17) attended the event and praised Adichie for being down to earth.
“A simple line which she said a few times throughout the event was ‘I don’t know.’ This simple sentence gave the rest of what she said a great amount of credibility,” Aruleba said. “Oftentimes, speakers come to Gaston as experts in their fields with the answers to everything, but the fact that she acknowledged the gaps in her knowledge when asked some hard questions showed me how wise of a woman she was.”

A panel of leaders of Catholic publications spoke about divisions within the Catholic Church and Pope Francis’ ideas for unification of the church in an event sponsored by the Initiative on Catholic and Social Thought in Gaston Hall on Thursday evening.
The panel, moderated by Director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life John Carr, included five leading figures in the Catholic magazine world including Fr. Matt Malone, S.J., the editor-in-chief of America magazine, Paul Baumann, editor of Commonweal, Rusty Reno, editor of First Things, Caitlin Hendel, President and CEO of National Catholic Reporter, and Greg Erlandson, president and publisher of Our Sunday Visitor.
Theodore McCarrick, an Archbishop Emeritus of Washington, D.C., delivered opening remarks. He explained that current divides in the Catholic Church have the potential to be fixed by discussion and compromise.
“Pope Francis has given such powerful momentum and clear direction for our work, tonight’s topic is a reflection of his vision and example,” McCarrick said. “He warns us against temptation and the dangers of ideology.”
Reno began by discussing Catholicism and its relationship with the economy, explaining that the church is not doing enough to encourage equality.
“I think the Catholic Church can support, we are able to support, free markets without the illusion that getting rich is enough,” Reno said. “Without the illusion that the markets are going to take care of, discharge automatically our responsibility to our neighbors. That’s something we can contribute to a society that is very tempted by kind of libertarian fantasies.”
Reno also brought up the role of the Catholic Church in American society, and said that a growing group of Americans see the church as an obstruction.
“[There is] a growing recognition that in our society, the Catholic Church is in the way,” Reno said. “It’s in the way of a lot of things that powerful people want. It’s in the way of abortion on demand, it’s in the way of euthanasia, it’s in the way of radical uses of reproductive technology, you know, we’re in the way. …Our concerns of the weak and the vulnerable are in the way. And we’re being pushed out of the way. I think we can’t, in fact, retreat because we’re too big.”
Hendel noted the contrasting political ideologies of Catholics and spoke about the difficulties religious voters face when choosing a candidate.
“I think that for Catholics because there is such a divisiveness among them, that it paralyzes us as a political influence,” Hedel said. “Just the pro-life issue itself makes it very difficult to choose a good gubernatorial candidate because you have you know the one that is pro-life as far as abortion issue goes but then you have the one that is pro-life as far as the death penalty goes. They are rarely on the same ballot.”
Malone said that the panel showed such a diversity of opinion because people often only read news sources that correspond with their belief system.
“We are getting our news and information from sources with whom we are already likely to agree, that we have already clicked like on,” Malone said. “And so, it’s actually making the discourse worse. All the more important then, that I think that Catholic media organizations try to provide a model of a discourse that is different.”
Malone said that despite this, all Catholics have a solid base on which to unify.
“What we have in common, fundamentally, I think, and it’s been alluded to here, is our commitment to God and Jesus Christ. [That] is crucially important,” Malone said.
Chris Grillo (SFS ’17) attended the event and said he was intrigued by the discussion, especially when the panelists spoke about religion’s relationship to politics.
“I’m interested in looking at the intersection between faith and politics, specifically in the era of Pope Frank,” Grillo said. “Any democratic society requires a certain element of faith that requires morals for its citizens to fall back on, and I think that Catholic faith is a good place to start.”

Saudi fashion blogger and designer Alaa Balkhy discussed fashion in the Arab world and her creation of the brand Fyunka at an event hosted by the Georgetown Arab Society in White-Gravenor Hall on Thursday.
The event, co-sponsored by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund and the Georgetown Retail and Luxury Association, featured the 25-year-old who currently lives in New York as part of an initiative to bring a part of modern Arabic culture to the university.
Balkhy was born in Saudi Arabia but lived in Canada until the age of nine. Balkhy spoke about how she noticed several cultural differences that made an impression on her.
“As a child, I never understood why in Ramadan we had to eat late or why we couldn’t eat pepperoni pizza. It was so hard for my parents to explain to us, as kids, why we were a little bit different,” Balkhy said.
She then returned to Saudi Arabia, where she jumped between different schools and cities. When she graduated from high school, there weren’t many options for women in terms of universities, with only three private schools and one public university accepting female students, but she still managed to graduate from college and earn a bachelor’s degree in graphic design.
After graduation, she assumed that she would be able to find a job since graphic design was a growing field.
“I was looking for a job for a year, but there was nothing. So, I thought about creating something. You tend to be bilingual in the way you design. You have to mix Arabic and English, and that for me was very interesting,” she explained.
As she continued to look for a job, Balkhy conceived the idea for the brand Fyunka, which mainly focuses on bags.
“I wanted the name of the brand to be Arabic — that was so important to me — to show where it came from. I also wanted to show that the brand was from Jeddah,” she said. “I tried to make a statement bag, because in the Gulf specifically, girls tend to carry more expensive bags or designer bags. I wanted to break this trend.”
Balkhy noted the importance of social media to Fyunka’s success, especially in her home country of Saudi Arabia.
“Instagram was a huge factor. We have 11,000 followers right now, and I can see that every time I take Fyunka to another country, there is repercussion in Instagram. People, especially in Saudi, tend to use social media more, because there is no public social life. So it tends to be more online,” Balkhy said.
She then discussed her plans for the future as she looks into possibly creating a new brand as well.
“I want to be in the department stores. But I would also love to create another brand, other than Fyunka. Something that is more mature. I feel like I created Fyunka three years ago, and I’m evolving. I’m growing and I feel like the brand is also growing. Maybe keep Fyunka and create something else that is more mature,” Balkhy said.
Salma Jordan, who owns the accessory brand TARB, attended the event.
“I own a company and as an owner, it was interesting and brought insight. She talked about her struggles and how she decides which products to put up and at the same time maintain the integrity of her brand. I’ve been following her work for a couple of years and I’m excited to see where it is going to go in the future,” Jordan said.
Alexandra Medellin (COL’16) said that she particularly enjoyed Balkhy’s personality.
“I thought the event was great. She was an incredibly candid and charming speaker, and was willing to take as many questions as we threw at her. I found it really informative,” Medellin said.

Richard Kraemer, a senior program officer at the National Endowment for Democracy, spoke about the future of Afghanistan in an event sponsored by the School of Foreign Service and the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding on Wednesday in the Intercultural Center.
Kraemer, who specializes in the Middle East and North Africa, discussed Afghanistan’s recent presidential elections. In what was alleged to be a fraudulent result, Abdullah Abdullah was defeated by Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai for the presidency. After intense negotiations, the government decided to appoint Ahmadzai as president and Abdullah as CEO — a newly re-established position equated to that of a prime minister — of Afghanistan.
“For an already divided society, this has been one of the most divisive issues we’ve seen. … Everyone has a view on it,” Kraemer said. “There are a lot of misconceptions … all that are going to have to be managed as Abdullah and Ahmadzai try to go forward in the unity government.”
Tamara Sonn, the Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani professor in the history of Islam, said that the recent events in Afghanistan suffer from a lack of coverage, and that Kraemer could provide necessary insight.
“It’s a difficult situation and it’s very unclear how that power sharing arrangement will work,” Sonn said. “We’re very lucky to have with us Richard Kraemer to tell us a little bit about the status of the power-sharing agreement and some kind of ideas about what might happen next.”
According to Kraemer, the people of Afghanistan were very hopeful as the first phase of the presidential elections neared.
“Going back to April 5, there was a tremendous degree of elation, I mean, we saw almost 60 percent of the population turn out and vote after what had been a series of lackluster performances in 2009 onward,” Kraemer said.
Kraemer said that Afghanistan’s electoral process has the potential to be fair and balanced in the future.
“This is a very inspiring time for Afghans and those of us that work on Afghanistan who care about the country’s future, because we saw these people brave the likelihood of being subjected to any kind of insurgent violence,” Kraemer said. “We saw that there had been decreasing amounts of fraud.”
Ahmadzai, a former World Bank economist and finance minister, won the popular vote over Abdullah, a doctor and former foreign minister, by about 56 percent to 44 percent, which some claim was the result of fraud. Kraemer said that he was disappointed in the ensuing accusations, although he understood them.
“You can see the murkiness, you can get a sense of the degree of fraud, you can get a sense of why there were various sides that thought they had been wrongly treated in this process,” Kraemer said.
Kraemer said that the problems with the election put Afghanistan in a precarious position.
“The first couple weeks now have actually been encouraging,” Kraemer said. “[Ahmadzai has] said a lot of the right things, he’s taken a lot of the right steps and he’s taken some concrete action as well.”
Thaameran Sarveswaran (SFS ’18) said that went to the talk because of his interest in Afghanistan and South Asia and was eager to hear from an expert.
“Specifically to me, I’m studying Farsi, so I’m working with the region,” he said. “I came because [the topic] was Afghanistan.”
According to Sarveswaran, Kraemer’s speech gave an interesting perspective on the current turmoil in Afghanistan.
“[Kraemer’s] insight into the Afghan democratic process and the future of the Afghan unity government post withdrawal was thought provoking and optimistic,” Sarveswaran said.
