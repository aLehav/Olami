The right to privacy is essential in any free society, argued former National Security Agency employee Edward Snowden in his second virtual discussion with Georgetown students Wednesday.
Snowden, who participated in the discussion in Lohrfink Auditorium via Skype, is currently living in asylum in Moscow, Russia, after he leaked classified information from the NSA in 2013, disclosing the organization’s surveillance programs. He is wanted by the U.S. government for the theft of government property.
The event, hosted by the Lecture Fund, coincides with the recent release of Oliver Stone’s new film “Snowden,” portraying Snowden’s release of the documents and its aftermath, on Sept. 16.
On Oct. 5, the FBI revealed that since the summer it had been investigating a former NSA contractor for stealing classified documents, putting national security under the spotlight again. The New York Times reported Oct. 5 that Yahoo was searching emails for signs indicating state-sponsored terrorism as part of its mechanisms searching for child pornography and spam.
Snowden said those who argue they do not mind the NSA’s scanning their email — citing the fact that they have nothing to hide — underestimate the impact of government tapping into all internet usage.
“That is really a misunderstanding of the way people interact with technology,” Snowden said. “Because the difference is this is voluntarily; there is a difference between intensely intimate details that you wouldn’t tell anyone listened to without our consent.”
According to Snowden, both consent and privacy are essential in a free society.
“When you are talking about a liberal society, a modern society, our society, our government was founded on one bedrock principle and that is the consent of government — consent is only meaningful if it’s in a form,” Snowden said.
Snowden said privacy is about protecting information, not hiding it.
“Privacy isn’t about something to hide, privacy is about something to protect and that thing is you,” Snowden said. “When you lose privacy, you’re losing an open society, you’re losing the opportunity to make mistakes.”
Privacy is the most fundamental human right, according to Snowden.
“Privacy is the fountainhead from which every other right is derived,” Snowden said. “Privacy is the right to the self. Without it, you are not even part of society: You are just subject to it.”
Snowden said he was surprised by the events following his decision to leak classified information.
“I expected a five-day story,” Snowden said. “I thought I would end up in jail.”
Snowden currently resides in Russia, after the country granted him asylum in June 2013, the same month he began releasing the documents.
Snowden said he went to the press to raise awareness and make it more difficult for the U.S. government to deny the existence of his documents.
“I wanted to get the issues back on media and change the conversation,” Snowden said. “But the media doesn’t tell stories without faces.”
According to Snowden, Stone’s film accurately portrays the state of U.S. policies relating to information and privacy.
“My particular focus of the film that I was pleased to see is that a lot of the policy aspects were accurate,” Snowden said. “If my side of the story is screwed up I’m not that worried because I don’t care so much about my reputation.”
Lecture Fund Chairman D.J. Angelini (MSB ’17) said bringing Snowden to campus two years in a row showcases how classroom lessons translate to the world outside the university.
“Today we thought with all the news regarding privacy and civil liberties and the release of his movie, there isn’t a better time to bring a more relevant speaker to highlight some of these lessons we learn in the classroom in a real-life, tangible way,” Angelini said.
The Lecture Fund’s event featuring Snowden last year was delayed by 45 minutes due to a technical glitch.
Danae Alogoskoufi (COL ’20), who attended the event, said Snowden’s arguments on privacy were reasonable.
“I particularly agreed with Snowden when he argued that without privacy all our other rights are diminished,” Alogoskoufi said. “I thought he was very articulate with his views and I liked the fact that he did not want the focus to be on him but at the same time he realized that if he did not speak out they would bury his discovery.”
Aishah Malhas (COL ’20) said she appreciated Snowden’s attitude in light of the public attention he has garnered.
“His modesty regarding his role in disclosing top-secret NSA files and his indifference about the consequences that this bore on his own life proved how passionate he was about what he was fighting for and how much he considered cyber freedom to be essential,” Malhas said.

The grand opening of Washington, D.C.’s only Planned Parenthood clinic Sept. 26 was marred by two dozen protesters who swarmed the facility’s headquarters outside a celebratory launch gala attended by notables including Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and actress Kathleen Turner.
The facility, named the Carol Whitehill Moses Center, is strategically located in Northeast D.C. so as to be accessible from all parts of the District. The 27,000-square-foot clinic will serve as the administrative headquarters for Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington and is expected to provide services to more than 12,000 people in its first year.
The $20 million facility includes six nonsurgical exam rooms and four procedure rooms, making it larger than the two D.C. clinics that shut down in the past two years.
The Carol Whitehill Moses Center directly replaces one in downtown D.C. that closed in June 2015 after 40 years of service. Another clinic in Southeast D.C. closed in 2014. Maryland hosts three other locations in Suitland, Gaithersburg and Silver Spring, close to the metropolitan area.
The Carol Whitehill Moses Center Vice President of External Relations Mara Braunger said the location’s opening is the product of years of planning and represents the core of Planned Parenthood.
“We are thrilled. This has been years in the making,” Braunger said. “The current facility not only encompasses our values, of our dignity and of the Planned Parenthood brand but also is a fantastic anchor for a vibrant resource center in Northeast D.C.”
Van Hollen, who attended the center’s opening gala, said he fought attempts to defund Planned Parenthood in the Senate so more locations nationwide will have access to reproductive rights.
“It will provide vital health services to women and men across the region,” Hollen wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Planned Parenthood makes every effort to provide a safe and welcoming environment for its patients and employees, and I am confident this new facility will be welcomed as a vital health resource in the community.”
Prior to the opening of the new D.C. Planned Parenthood, the organization operated weekly clinics out of the Shaw-based nonprofit Bread for the City, which provides low-income D.C. residents with comprehensive services.
Bread for the City Communications Manager Karen Byer said the partnership between the two organizations proved beneficial for the community.
“We were pleased to open up our center to PP of DC,” Byer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We see ourselves as community partners and we were happy that we could play a small role in their expansion.”
The clinic offers services to both men and women including breast and pelvic exams, emergency contraception, same-day birth control, treatment for sexually transmitted infections, HPV vaccines and abortion services.
In 2015, Planned Parenthood served more than 20,000 people in the D.C. area. According to a Sept. 27 article from The Washington Post, 12,000 women used its birth control and 19,000 people were treated for sexually transmitted diseases last year. Fifty-four percent of its patients were women of color and 42 percent were 25 or younger.
Braunger said Planned Parenthood works to serve low-income patients who might not otherwise have access to medical services. Additionally, she cited the facility as a space for people to receive services without stigma or criticism.
“Planned Parenthood across the nation fills needs for low-income women and men and even more than that in the beacon of safety, where people can come for a variety of reproductive health services where they are treated in supportive manner,” Braunger said. “And no matter what service, they receive it without any judgment. I’m not sure that a whole lot of medical facilities can stand behind that type of brand promise.”
Amelia Irvine (COL ’19), president of anti-abortion student group Vita Saxa, said opening a new clinic was unnecessary given the presence of three other clinics in the D.C. area.
“I regard this clinic’s opening as deeply saddening, but I ultimately understand that this is no great accomplishment for Planned Parenthood,” Irvine wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Women have other options in D.C. for obtaining contraceptives, primary care, STI testing and cancer screening, and thus the opening of this Planned Parenthood clinic only hurts women in the District.”
After construction of the clinic began in September 2015, anti-abortion activists clashed with the neighboring Two Rivers Public Charter School. According to a December 2015 lawsuit filed by the school’s board of trustees, the alleged protesters heckled children as young as 3 years old by displaying images of aborted fetuses.
In July, protesters accepted the terms of an injunction to limit their activity near the school. According to the injunction, the protesters are not allowed to interact with anyone on school grounds.
Though Irvine said she disagreed with the tactics used by these protesters, she is troubled by the clinic’s proximity to the elementary school.
“I don’t believe it’s appropriate for pro-life protesters to deliberately show graphic images of any sort to children,” Irvine wrote. “It is highly inappropriate for the clinic to be located next to an elementary school. My first concern is for post-abortive women; I can’t imagine seeing an elementary school or children at recess after undergoing an abortion.”
The new facility was designed to protect its workers from protesters, with security guards checking in guests at the entrance. Additionally, employees can leave through an outdoor courtyard instead of the main entrance to avoid abortion protesters.
Safety measures were brought on in light of multiple high-profile attacks on Planned Parenthood clinics, one of the most recent occurring when Robert Lewis Dear Jr. shot and killed three and injured nine more at a Colorado Springs clinic last November.
H*yas for Choice Co-President Emily Stephens (COL ’18) said she agrees that employee safety is a large concern for the new clinic.
“Most Planned Parenthoods face pretty much constant protest. That’s why there are clinic escorts who go and stand outside as a counterbalance to the protesters and escort people who are actually using the clinic inside,” Stephens said. “D.C. is lucky because they have a really well-established clinic escort program.”
Braunger said as an employee of Planned Parenthood, she is confident enough in its safety measures to feel secure working there.
“The way Planned Parenthood works is we have a very realistic view of safety and making sure that the safety of our patients comes as a priority. And so if I didn’t feel secure and comfortable I wouldn’t work here,” Braunger said. “It’s top priority and we have a very strong safety record, we have multilayered protocol in place, we have a very good relationship with all levels of law enforcement. And so I feel as comfortable working here as I would anywhere in the District.”
 
Correction: A previous version of this article listed Mara Braunger as the president of external relations. She is the vice president. The center opened on Sept. 26, not 27 in Northeast D.C. Additionally, the previous version stated federal funds were used to construct the building, which is incorrect. No federal funds were used.

Stop picking on Robert Lewis Dear. He was only trying to protect babies from being killed at Planned Parenthood

If it is newsworthy to report the number of people who used PP’s “birth control” services (unless that is code for abortion) or how many people were treated for sexually transmitted diseases last year, then why isn’t it newsworthy to report is how many babies were aborted – does PP not publish that information and why not?  
Isn’t PP proud of what they do?  Did the author look into this?  Doesn’t want to know?  Doesn’t want the readers to know? Did the author try to find out that information, or intentionally overlooked this?

A new student-led group advocating for a smoke-free campus is petitioning the Georgetown University Student Association to hold a studentwide referendum on banning smoking on campus.
Smoke Free Georgetown, which is led by Mac Williams (NHS ’17) and GUSA Senator Henry Callander (COL ’18), launched its petition and Facebook page Tuesday. The campaign is independent from GUSA.
The group hopes the petition will encourage the university to hold a referendum, according to Callander.
“The main purpose behind the petition is to hold a referendum. The idea is that we’re just kind of trying to gauge what students feel about the matter and the issue,” Callander said. “If the student body believes that it’s the right course of action through a referendum, then that’s the course, hopefully, the university will take.”
GUSA Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) said a referendum on the issue will only be held if it passes a GUSA senate vote.
“The senate will vote on whether or not to have a referendum if either a) a senator introduces the topic and calls for a vote, or b) if a petition to call for a referendum reaches 300 signatures,” Fisk wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Currently, university regulations prohibit smoking in any indoor spaces. Smoking is only permitted in designated areas, which have to be away from entrances to minimize the change of secondhand smoke.
The Georgetown University Medical School campus implemented a full ban on smoking in 2014.
In April 2014, students launched a similar petition to make the main campus smoke-free.
However, the Smoke Free Georgetown campaign aims to achieve a complete smoking ban on Georgetown’s main campus. Callander said this would be the best solution and would match Georgetown’s policies with those of many other universities.
Other universities, including Harvard University and The George Washington University, have already implemented complete bans on smoking. Sixty-five percent of schools ban smoking completely, according to Williams.
As of Oct. 1 this year there are 1,713 college campuses in the country with comprehensive bans on smoking, according to anti-smoking advocacy group Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights.
This grew from the 446 smoke-free campuses in October 2010.
“For now, we’ve been talking about going 100 percent smoke-free,” Callander said. “That would be the most effective approach, and that’s what other peer institutions have done. So, we want to follow suit and do the exact same thing.”
As of 2:30 a.m., the Facebook page had amassed 255 likes. Callander and Williams declined to disclose the number of signatures on the petition so far.
Williams said the group was motivated to bring Georgetown in line with peer institutions to create a healthier campus.
“The initiative was started to try and bring Georgetown in line with our peer institutions with the ultimate goal of improving the health of our students, faculty and visitors of campus,” Williams said.
A 2012 surgeon general’s report on tobacco use said secondhand smoking is linked to fetal abnormalities and can exacerbate asthma and pre-existing lung conditions.
GUSA has not been made formally aware of the group’s goal of a smoke-free campus, according to Fisk, but it is willing to take the necessary steps to address the issue if the student body desires.
“The topic of a smoke free campus has not been something formally brought to us, but if students care about it and want to make it a priority, we’ll respond accordingly,” Fisk wrote.
GUSA Senator At-Large Scott Lowder (COL ’17) said he is in favor of a campuswide ban on smoking because secondhand smoke can adversely affect students with health issues.
Lowder said his own experience with asthma has made him aware of the public health issue smoking poses.
“I do believe smoking shouldn’t be on campus.  I think the overriding concern should always be the health of the students, especially as a student who suffers from asthma and has actually gotten asthma attacks from direct exposure to secondhand smoke,” Lowder said.
Smoking is a common concern for prospective parents, according to Williams. Williams, who is a Blue and Gray Society tour guide, said many parents of prospective students expressed their concern at the amount of smokers on campus.
For Williams, the personal inspiration for Smoke Free Georgetown was the desire to improve his own health and that of other students on campus.
“I started thinking about this my sophomore year, but I’m also a tour guide. All the time I get questions from parents asking ‘Why do I see people smoking on campus?’” Williams said. “It’s something that’s important to me. My health and the health of my peers is very important to me.”
Callander said Georgetown should emulate other universities in banning smoking and promoting the health of students.
“The entire [Univeristy of California] system and [California State University] system already consists of about 30 to 40 schools. They all went 100 percent smoke-free in 2013 and 2014. You see these public schools have this trend of doing this because this is a very positive initiative,” Callander said. “So we want to take ourselves to the same spot.”
Smoke Free Georgetown aims to allow students with concerns about smoking on campus to express their views on whether smoking should be allowed on campus, according to Callander.
“We leave it up to the student body. We’re literally the messengers and we want the students to be the push. It’s not our place to do it,” Callander said.

Clean Air Quality Law.
It is hereby ordered that all things that generate chemical releases simular in nature to tobacco smoke are hereby OUTLAWED.
1. Automobiles and gas or diesel engines or any other contivance that emits chemcial releases. This savings equals to the public not being forced to inhale 100s of billions of cigarettes each day.
2. All plants are outlawed as they releases tons daily of the Carcinogen ISOPRENE. Equal in volumes of Millions of cigarettes each day.
3. Restaraunts will be outlawed from preparing any cooked foods as these release 100s of millions of equal cigarettes each day.
4. In home cooking is also outlawed as it produces upwards of 10s of thousands of equal cigarettes inside and outside the home.
5. Outdoor cookouts and fireworks are outlawed as they releases 100s of millions of equivalent cigarettes a day or on weekends in the yards and parks of our city.
6. Humans are hereby outlawed from existence insode the city limits as their own human breath contains hundreds of the same chemicals as found in tobacco smoke!
7. Nature itself is outlawed as it generates Billions of chemcial releases naturally into the atmosphere a day hense posing a threat to human life.
8. This Clean air law becomes effective Immediately.
9. Your preference of suicide is a personal choise,Police will write tickets and lock up any survivors after this law becomes effective. A grace period of 30 days will be in place to educate the public on its existence.

The Ghost Town Administration has just learned that all these chemicals found in tobacco smoke are natural to the earth and that mankind also evolved within this filth ridden air!
Therefore all Tobacco Control Measures are here by OUTLAWED as for being contrived JUNK SCIENCE!

OSHA also took on the passive smoking fraud and this is what came of it:
Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence: Third Edition 
 This sorta says it all 
 These limits generally are based on assessments of health risk and calculations of concentrations that are associated with what the regulators believe to be negligibly small risks. The calculations are made after first identifying the total dose of a chemical that is safe (poses a negligible risk) and then determining the concentration of that chemical in the medium of concern that should not be exceeded if exposed individuals (typically those at the high end of media contact) are not to incur a dose greater than the safe one. 
 So OSHA standards are what is the guideline for what is acceptable ”SAFE LEVELS”
OSHA SAFE LEVELS 
 All this is in a small sealed room 9×20 and must occur in ONE HOUR. 
 For Benzo[a]pyrene, 222,000 cigarettes. 
 “For Acetone, 118,000 cigarettes. 
 “Toluene would require 50,000 packs of simultaneously smoldering cigarettes. 
 Acetaldehyde or Hydrazine, more than 14,000 smokers would need to light up. 
 “For Hydroquinone, “only” 1250 cigarettes. 
 For arsenic 2 million 500,000 smokers at one time. 
 The same number of cigarettes required for the other so called chemicals in shs/ets will have the same outcomes. 
 So, OSHA finally makes a statement on shs/ets : 
 Field studies of environmental tobacco smoke indicate that under normal conditions, the components in tobacco smoke are diluted below existing Permissible Exposure Levels (PELS.) as referenced in the Air Contaminant Standard (29 CFR 1910.1000)…It would be very rare to find a workplace with so much smoking that any individual PEL would be exceeded.” -Letter From Greg Watchman, Acting Sec’y, OSHA.
Why are their any smoking bans at all they have absolutely no validity to the courts or to science!

And where will the smokers go? 
Do you children even stop to wonder what effect your heavy-handed bans and rules will have on people who are addicted to smoking and can’t stop just because you stamped your feet and told them it was icky?

In the wake of protests and an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office following the police shooting and death of Terrence Sterling, D.C. officials released graphic footage from an officer’s body-worn camera on Sept. 27 and the identity of the Metropolitan Police Department officer who shot him.
Sterling, a 31-year-old from Fort Washington, Md., was shot by MPD officer Brian Trainer, 27, a four-year member of the department, during the early morning hours of Sept. 11. Prior to the release of the video and Trainer’s identity, MPD reported that the officer shot Sterling, who it claims was driving erratically, when he attempted to ram his motorcycle into the passenger door of the police car the officer was exiting.
Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) release of Trainer’s name marked a departure from MPD precedent in which city officials decline to release the identities of officers involved in shootings. Trainer and his partner, who has not been named, have been placed on paid administrative leave.
Hundreds of protestors marched through Northwest D.C. on Monday evening demanding greater transparency from the mayor’s office regarding the investigation. Prior to the march, the protestors held a vigil near Third and M streets NW, where Sterling was shot.
Deputy Communications Director of the mayor’s office Nicole Chapple said the city released the five-minute video as a way to increase transparency with the public during the investigation.
“We deemed the body-worn camera footage to be in the public interest and consistent with the goals of the program and how it’s been establishing and creating a broader accountability between the law enforcement communities and transparent government,” Chapple said.
The body-worn camera footage begins one to three minutes after the shooting took place and shows Sterling bleeding on the ground as officers attempt to administer first aid to him.
“Keep looking at me, keep looking at me, buddy, keep looking at me, look at me,” an officer can be heard yelling. “Open them up, there you go. Open them up, open them up, open your eyes.”
The Chief Medical Examiner’s Office in D.C. said Sterling had two bullet wounds — one in his neck and one in his back. MPD declined to comment.
Chapple said it is still unclear when the investigation, undertaken by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, will be complete.
“We tried to maintain open[ness] and transparency and we want the investigation to be done in a complete manner,” Chapple said.
During a press conference last week, the Sterling family’s attorney Jason Downs probed several details of the case, including whether there are any additional surveillance videos. According to Downs, the Sterling family was allowed to see a 60-to 90-second clip — which was not included in the public video — which allegedly contained footage of a police union representative urging Trainer to turn off his camera.
Downs further questioned why the hasty arrival of a police union representative on the scene preceded the arrival of medical attendants.
“The family and the community want to know, who do these officers call first?” Downs said. “Do they call an ambulance to protect an innocent civilian? Or did they call a police union representative to help Officer Trainer get his story straight?”
One point of contention surrounding Sterling’s death is why Trainer’s body-worn camera was not turned on until a few minutes after he shot Sterling. In response to this incident, D.C. officials have mandated that dispatchers remind officers to switch their cameras on before responding.
Harlan Yu, principal of Upturn, a company that released a scorecard with the Leadership Conference Aug. 2 in order to monitor body-worn cameras in cities across the country, said D.C.’s policy regarding those cameras has improved with the new measure. Yu also praised D.C.’s commitment to transparency in showing those who were captured on the videos the footage.
Overall, Upturn favorably categorized MPD’s policy of limiting officers’ discretion on when to record, making the MPD policy publicly and readily available and making footage available for individuals filing complaints. However, the policy was criticized for limiting retention of footage and for placing no restrictions on the use of biometric technologies like facial recognition to identify individuals in footage.
“I think it’s a positive step in the right direction,” Yu said. “D.C.’s policy is pretty good in requiring officers to record all interactions; they have a pretty long list of required events where body worn cameras need to be on.”
Yu noted by not having his camera on at the time of the incident, Trainer acted in violation of both former and current MPD policy. Yu said the body-worn camera policy must not be ignored in the future by officers if it is to be truly successful.
“It’s certainly the case that in the Terrence Sterling incident, that officer should have had his camera on, and it wasn’t, and that officer had pretty clearly violated D.C. police policy on this,” Yu said. “While the policy itself is pretty strong, it’s only as good as the enforcement of that policy by staff.”

Human rights attorney Ahilan Arulanantham (COL ’94) was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship, a no-strings-attached five-year grant worth $625,000 for individuals who demonstrate exceptional creativity in their work. Arulanantham currently serves as the American Civil Liberties Union’s director of advocacy and the legal director of the ACLU of Southern California. In an interview with The Hoya, Arulanantham reflects on his plans for the fellowship, his advocacy for detainees being tried for deportation and his years at Georgetown.
What are your goals for your fellowship, and more specifically, what would you like to achieve with your grant?
I hope the award allows me to elevate the work that I’ve been doing, and broadly speaking, my goal is to bring immigration, detention and deportation systems into harmony with our values and our constitutional law. I don’t see the fellowship as fundamentally changing my direction and my work. I do want to take a portion of the funds and use it to support work that I care about but did not get to pursue in my life, and in particular, I’m thinking about human rights work in Sri Lanka. My family is from Sri Lanka, and I care very deeply about the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, which remains very problematic for people of the Tamil minority. My family, we’re Sri Lankan Tamil. There are human rights organizations doing important work there and I want to use at least a portion of [the grant] to support them. Beyond that, I haven’t really thought about it. I’ve thought about it some, but I haven’t really gotten a fixed idea of how to use it in support of my work, and it’s a great problem to have. I’m still pondering it.
You have worked in immigration law and expanding rights to detainees being tried for deportation for many years. What is the most significant case that you have worked on?
I think the case which is going to the Supreme Court in December is a challenge to the detention system under which immigrants are incarcerated for years without a hearing in front of a judge on whether their detention is actually necessary. It’s all kinds of immigrants — it’s people who are lawfully present, green card holders who had a conviction but finished serving their sentence and after that get sent to a second prison system while their immigration case goes on.  Others are refugees — people fleeing the most dangerous countries on earth come to our shores and then get imprisoned for months and sometimes years while we decide whether or not they’re eligible for asylum. I’ve worked on [Rodriguez v. Robbins] for almost a decade already and now it’s going to the Supreme Court. That’s certainly very significant compared to most of the cases I’ve done.
What has been your inspiration in pursuing your line of work and advocating for minorities, especially the immigrant population?
I was born here, but my family is from Sri Lanka and we’re Tamil. My parents left before there was a whole civil war, but they were subject to job discrimination and there was sporadic violence against the Tamil really throughout the period they were growing up in the country. They came here because they just did not believe Sri Lanka would be a stable and productive place for them and for their children. And then when I was 10, the civil war began in Sri Lanka, and much of my extended family fled the country. Many of them actually came and stayed with us. My cousins, aunts and uncles, and then other more extended family, and then other people who were not related to us. That experience was very formative for me because I was sort of a firsthand witness to the struggle that refugees and immigrants go through, and then also the successes they can have. My cousins and aunts and uncles, some of them are extremely successful people now. That experience as a whole left a very deep impression on me.
What are the main issues that remain with the deportation system?
Number one I would say is basic due process protection is absent. In that I would include legal representation for at least many if not all immigrants facing deportation. You have to remember the government pays for a prosecutor to argue in favor of deportation in every case in immigration court, yet we don’t provide counsel even for the most vulnerable immigrants like children, people who are asylum seekers fleeing persecution, people who have lived here for long periods of time who are separated from their families. Basic due process protection is lacking.
How did your time at Georgetown influence your work?
The biggest influence by far was my participation in the debate team. I learned many of the critical thinking skills and also life skills like hard work, doing work for its own sake and not necessarily because of the result, working in teams.  So many things I learned through my participation on the debate team. It was a huge part of my experience at Georgetown. Also, I’m still close to a number of people who I went to school with at Georgetown, and those friendships have sustained me at different points in time including some of the rough times in my life and over the years.  A lot of the people I’m still closest to today are people like my roommate. Those friendships really have lasted.
What wisdom would you like to impart to current Georgetown students who are passionate about immigration issues, human rights and law?
The most important thing I would say is try to imagine the world that you want to see, the world as it should look if it were just and fair in your conception of what that should be. And then, set your sights to make the world that way. That would be the first thing I would say. The second thing I would say is just remember the path will not be straight, the job that allows you to do that may not be open to you immediately the day after you graduate, or the day after you graduate law school, or whatever it is. Even if you get the job that you think is that job, then doing that work is not going to be straightforward.
But just remember that the value comes in trying to come to shape the world in a way that’s more fair and just as you see it and continuing to do that work. Living your life that way is incredibly rewarding. Every day when I go to work I know that there’s nothing else I’d rather be doing. I’m not postponing for later the thing that I really want to do with my life now.

As the union representing facilities workers continues contract negotiations with the university, student advocacy group Georgetown Solidarity Committee has accumulated more than 400 signatures from members of the community on a petition to push the university to address a series of contract demands, including a 5 percent raise and further raises tied to the cost of inflation.
The petition — launched online on Sept. 28 — will run for the next few weeks, according to GSC organizers. GSC hopes to obtain 1,000 signatures before submitting the petition to university administrators.
The petition is part of a campaign to promote awareness of ongoing contract negotiations. The university has been negotiating terms for a new labor contract with the Service Employees International Union 1199 Union Local since early September.
GSC is pushing the university to offer workers raises that are tied to cost of living increases and inflation. The university is currently offering a 2 percent increase in wages over the course of three years. GSC and Union 1199 are pushing for a 5 percent raise.
GSC members have also specified goals of ending understaffing and alleged racism and discrimination in the workplace and a minimum wage starting at $15 per hour.
The District’s minimum wage is currently $11.50 and will reach $15 by 2020.
University Media Relations Manager Ryan King said Georgetown is searching for a fair compensation package and hopes to finalize a deal soon.
“We are committed to providing fair and competitive compensation packages for all university employees,” King wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have a long history of collective bargaining with 1199SEIU and we have reached mutually acceptable collective bargaining agreements with the union in every negotiation.”
Students can sign the petition in person at Red Square on Wednesdays and through an online Google form advertised on the GSC Facebook page.
GSC also organized rallies and protests near McShain Lounge in McCarthy Hall, the site of ongoing negotiations, on Sept. 22, the site of the ongoing negotiations. The group also published and distributed pamphlets outside O’Donovan Hall seeking to educate students and workers about the goals of the negotiations.
Though GSC has raised awareness on issues pertaining to understaffing and the mistreatment of workers, the negotiations are mostly centered around the increase in wages.
GSC member Joseph Gomez  (SFS ’19) said the petition aims to raise student awareness and remind the administration that students care about workers on campus.
“Because it’s the beginning of the year, we want to reinvigorate student support for workers and to show administration that students on campus support the workers,” Gomez said.
Previously, the organization has used petitions in conjunction with coordinated campaign efforts.
In 2013, GSC disseminated petitions in an effort to persuade the university to cut its sportswear manufacturing contract with Nike after the company was accused of worker’s rights violations.
GSC organized a petition drive in 2015 as part of a campaign that sought for improved work and wage conditions for Aramark workers during their contract renegotiations with Aramark. Aramark employees and management agreed to a contract in April 2015, which includes a 40-hour paid work week, plans for unionization and less expensive health insurance.
Joshueua Pena (COL ’17) said he hopes this campaign succeeds in advocating for workers’ rights, but he remains cynical about its impact.
“They’ve done this stuff before and nothing changed, maybe slightly, but not a huge impact,” Pena said.
Pena said workers’ issues require more than student activism.
“This is an ongoing issue that’s not going to be solved by petition. It needs something more drastic,” Pena said. “I appreciate the effort, but they are not having a tangible impact.”

funny that this piece didn’t quote any workers, but decided to interview someone who probably doesn’t know any workers and definitely doesn’t lift a finger to fight on their behalf
smug liberals at the Hoya at it again with their meaningless moralizing

“Are You Ready?” — an annual conversation on preventing sexual assault on campus and better supporting survivors —  returned in its 14th iteration Wednesday.
Established in fall 2003, “Are You Ready?” is sponsored by Health Education Services and the Women’s Center in partnership with Counseling and Psychiatric Services and the LGBTQ resource center.
This year, the program, hosted in Copley Formal Lounge, featured a presentation by Marc Grimmet, a psychologist specializing in clinical mental health, and his partner Juliette, the founder of Chrysalis Network, an organization aiming to support the creation of programs to combat sexual assault and domestic and relationship violence.
Grimmet also serves as an associate professor and director of the Community Counseling Education and Research Clinic at North Carolina State University.
Juliette Grimmett spoke about her experience as a sexual assault survivor, while Marc Grimmet shared his perspective as an ally of survivors in their presentation “Working for Culture Change: A Story of Survival, Healing, and Action.”
Juliette Grimmet, who has more than 20 years of experience working with colleges, communities and schools to address campus sexual assault issues, said it is important to openly discuss the issue of sexual assault on college campuses and to educate students on how to take action against this issue.
Even the most open communities may not discuss sexual assault, according to Juliette Grimmet.
“I grew up in this very liberal community where we would talk about all these issues, but we didn’t talk about this,” Juliette Grimmet said.
Juliette Grimmet said the process she had to go through to report her rape was overly complicated and difficult compared to her perpetrator.
“We all just sit at this table for three and a half hours together sharing details about what happened,” Juliette Grimmet said. “My incident report was single-spaced, three and a half pages and extremely detailed. His was half a page basically double -spaced.”
According to Juliette Grimmet, although her university found her attacker responsible for the assault and for breaking the honor code, he was not expelled or suspended.
“His sanction is one year of social probation, which means still play on the lacrosse team, you can still live on campus, you can walk by Juliette on this really small campus,” Juliette Grimmet said. “He went on to work for George W.  Bush at the White House.”
Juliette Grimmet said this injustice motivated her to warn the rest of the campus community of the danger of sexual assault and to write letters to campus newspapers emphasizing the prevalence of the issue.
“Knowing that I had to stay at this school with this person who harmed me and knowing that they knew that and that they were OK with that and subjecting the community to potential violence, which I knew certainly was going to occur,” Juliette Grimmet said. “It really wasn’t until this happened that I truly, truly found my voice.”
Inspired to help others facing similar experiences, Juliette Grimmet became a peer educator and pursued positive change through educating others and setting up programs to advocate for survivors.
Marc Grimmet said friends and allies of survivors can be especially important in supporting survivors.
“Sometimes, our friends and families tell us things that are happening to them, but we have to be really thoughtful about how we respond because if we respond in an inappropriate way it can really be more harmful than good,” Marc Grimmet said.
Marc Grimmet said hearing survivors’ stories is essential to raising awareness and creating a community that is receptive to change.
“I don’t think we can really appreciate it and know that we all have a role in doing something about it until we’re able to hear these stories and know they have been all too often and too common,” Marc Grimmet said.
Maddy Moore (SFS ’17), who is the chair of the Georgetown University Student Association safety and sexual assault policy team, said the purpose of the program is to develop a more supportive campus for survivors of sexual assault.
“The goal of ‘Are You Ready?’ is to create a university community that is supportive of survivors and that does not tolerate sexual assault,” Moore said.
Carla Goodwin (COL ’18), who attended the discussion, said events such as “Are You Ready” are critical to furthering the overall narrative around campus assault.
“I think it’s necessary since the prevalence of sexual assault on campuses is very wide and it is not really talked about,” Goodwin said. “I think events like this are just really important.”
Laura Chant (NHS ’18), who also attended the event, said the conversation fostered by “Are You Ready” should continue beyond the night.
“Even though freshmen receive peer education on sexual assault during [New Student Orientation], it is vital that a larger conversation is had,” Chant said. “Recurring education is important to combat rape culture, so I really think events like ‘Are You Ready’ should be mandatory for all students; this conversation should no longer be ignored just because it makes some people uncomfortable.”

The Class of 2020 will be the School of Foreign Service’s centennial class, the SFS administration announced in a celebratory event in the Intercultural Center Auditorium on Friday.
The event featured speeches by SFS Dean Joel Hellman, Executive Director for the SFS Centennial Will Layman and several students. The event was followed by a barbecue and the distribution of SFS centennial T-shirts to all attendees on Copley Lawn.
Associate SFS Dean Sam Aronson said the SFS intends to showcase the past, present and future of the school through the centennial programs.
“The SFS as part of the Centennial wants to do many things, but we’re sort of dividing some of the work into three different buckets, one being past, present and future, and so The School That Walsh Built class is intentionally looking at the past, at the history of SFS,” Aronson said.
Leading up to its 100th anniversary in 2019, the SFS established a centennial office, which has spearheaded several new initiatives. Last spring, the SFS launched a special class on the history of the SFS called “The School That Walsh Built,” taught by SFS Chief of Staff Emily Zenick and Senior Associate Dean for Graduate and Faculty Affairs Tony Arend (SFS ’80). The class examined the university archives to identify prominent figures in the school and understand the school’s evolving culture throughout its history.
The SFS also formed the Century Scholars Program, where first-year students are paired with upperclassmen to celebrate the centennial and brainstorm possibilities for the next 100 years of the SFS, for the Class of 2019. The school is also launching the Centennial Entrepreneurship Program for students in the Class of 2020 this fall, given that the Class of 2020 will be the 100th graduating class from the SFS, while the Class of 2019 will be graduating in the school’s 100th year.
Aronson said the two centennial programs are designed to help the SFS develop plans for its future.
“It’s not meant to be binding but to help give the school some idea of what it could look like for the next century, so that’s another way to look at it,” Aronson said.
Centennial Entrepreneurship Program mentor Arielle Rosen (SFS ’19) said she appreciates the self-reflection the school is undergoing in preparation for the centennial.
“It’s been very cool to see how their idea for the centennial has been evolving and how they’re still trying to figure out what the SFS actually means and how to best celebrate that,” Rosen said.
Century Scholar Isabella Perera (SFS ’19) said the SFS has done a good job engaging all stakeholders.
“I think it’s incredibly important that they’ve included the student voice,” Perera said. “I think it goes to show that they recognize the School of Foreign Service is a collaboration between the administrators, students and even alumni.”
Joshua Chang (SFS ’20), who attended the centennial kick-off event, said it made him proud to be in the SFS.
“I really enjoyed the event because it helped instill this sense of pride, in the sense that you’re in a distinguished school for international relations and foreign service, but also this reverence for how far the school has come since before World War I all the way to now,” Chang said.
Chang said he was optimistic for the impact the SFS Class of 2020 could have in their four years at Georgetown.
“It’s such an honor to be part of the 100th–year class,” Chang said. “I know that my peers and I will go on to do great things in terms of career and things we learned within the School of Foreign Service, and I hope that we can leave behind some definitive or long-lasting legacy.

To ensure health equity, there needs to be a united response to the prevalence of racism in health care, according to President of the American Public Health Association Camara Jones at a talk at the Georgetown University Medical Center on Monday.
According to Jones, racism has three levels — institutionalized, personally mediated and internalized — that each contributes to differing qualities of health care between demographics.
Jones said it is important to tackle all three levels of racism.
“That is our challenge, especially in these days. That is our challenge when you are activated as a campus community to acknowledge history and then have to rectify it,” Jones said. “The reason we need universal access to high-quality health care is because that’s how a civilized society values all of its people equally.”
Various systems of oppression must be addressed to ensure health equity, according to Jones.
“We must address these systems of power like racism, heterosexism, economic systems like capitalism and the like that are distributing resources in populations if we want to achieve social justice and eliminate health disparity.”
Jones also identified three major obstacles to reaching health equity: a lack of knowledge about historical culture, a narrow focus on the individual and an emphasis on meritocracy, which is particularly dangerous.
“The myth of meritocracy is a myth of equal opportunity which has not yet been realized in this country,” Jones said.
Jones said racism can be invisible to those who are not affected by it.
“It is difficult for men to recognize male privilege and sexism. It is difficult for white Americans to recognize white privilege and racism. It is difficult for all Americans to recognize how American privilege in the global context is,” Jones said. “But for those on the outside, they are very aware of that there’s a two-sided sign going on because the sign’s closed to them and they can look through the window and see people inside.”
Jones said even those who do not see racism must help address its prevalence in society.
“Does racism really exist? I say I know it’s hard to know. In fact, that’s part of being privileged — not to have to know,” Jones said. “But once you do know, you choose to act.  So it’s not a scary thing; it’s an empowering thing.  And it doesn’t even compel you to act, but it equips you to act.”
Jones proposed three steps towards achieving health equity: naming racism, considering in what forms racism is operating and organizing and strategizing to act. Addressing the social determinants of health is imperative in eliminating inequities in health care.
Taylor Brown (NHS ’16), who attended the event, said Jones’ call to action is a guiding principle as she prepares for life after Georgetown. A health care management and policy major, Brown said she hopes to influence the health care system to become more equitable.
“Being a health care management and policy major, it’s honestly been a very interdisciplinary major as far as studies go,” Brown said. “While I am interested in both management and policy, no matter what job I end up getting, I definitely want to not lose sight of the fact that I want to go into the health care field to create a more equitable system, and she gave me so many tips and recommendations to keep in mind as I’m looking for jobs.”
NHS Assistant Dean of Student Academic Affairs Brian Floyd said it is important for Georgetown to seek health equity in the community’s actions.
“As our institution has recently announced its steps to atone for its past with slavery, we also feel that this talk and topic is an important part of these efforts, not only to raise awareness to those in our community of the health disparities that continue to exist for many vulnerable populations but also to share how we as a school are committed to aiding in this effort,” Floyd said.
Jones invited the audience to participate in her talk and her work as a whole.
“I am going to share these tools with you so that they become your tools,” Jones said, “because this is not my national campaign against racism; I want to invite you to become active duty, anti-racism, actively engaged in it.”

The innovative use of data will significantly benefit the next White House administration, according to a new report by the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation and the McCourt School of Public Policy.
Sponsored by the Case Foundation, Nielsen and the Democracy Fund, the report —  titled “The Architecture of Innovation: Institutionalizing Innovation in Federal Policy Making” — was released and presented at the second session of the Beeck Center’s “Data for Social Good” series  Wednesday.
The report outlined suggestions to both Republican and Democratic presidential transition teams and encouraged hiring more technologically skilled employees throughout the public sector and incorporating technological innovation in city planning.
Beeck Center Executive Director Sonal Shah outlined the report and said the center is ready to start pursuing these goals and initiating policy discussions.
“We are thrilled with this report and also the incredible response that we’ve gotten on how to think about this architecture in the nation and government, especially in the federal government, and how to really think about these issues on a state level, but even internationally at the same time,” Shah said.
University Provost Robert Groves also discussed the need for new data ethics in the field, specifically citing how ethics should play a larger role in both data collection and use.
“This is a moment in time where we all collectively need to develop a new ethical framework for the treatment of data,” Groves said. “This phrase ‘data ethics’ is a term that we at Georgetown have been talking a lot about, and that both means the use of data for ethical purposes but also the inclusion of all sections of the population covered by data in order to drive our research.”
Groves added that data ethics are important for the university and other peer institutions that view community service and care for others as core aspects of their missions.
“We’re here because I think we share the belief that investing in data can help to increase both the understanding of us as a people, as a society, that human behavior that drives societal improvements and thereby improves public policy,” Groves said. “This is an institution that is devoted to service to others, and we think data can be a force for social good, so let’s hope that we’re devoting our energy to that.”
The event also featured a fireside chat with U.S. Chief Data Scientist in the Office of Science and Technology Policy DJ Patil, Executive Director for the Deloitte Center for Government Insights William D. Eggers and Dean of the McCourt School of Public Policy Edward Montgomery. A panel discussion with Executive Director of the International Business Machines Center for the Business of Governance Daniel Chenok, professor and former Dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy Donald Kettl, Chief Technology Officer for the District of Columbia Archana Vemulapalli and National Director of the U.S. Cyber Challenge Karen Evans followed.
Sunil Ishairzay, a managing partner of sustainable development nonprofit Earthopia who attended the event, said he was interested in how the speakers and the report connect data with other global issues such as rural development and democratization.
“Technology is one of the areas that we’re really looking to to help with a lot of these rural development areas so that they can leapfrog into different stages,” Ishairzay said. “I’m also interested to see how they use data not just as a tool for governance, but also how they can use it for actual social good and to make it useful for democratization, for true democracy, to give people a voice.”
Clara Cecil (MSB ’18), who also attended the event, said she was interested in use of data as a tool for service and hoped the event would touch on how data can work to solve global environmental issues.
“I’m really interested in using data for the betterment of society. I’m curious as to how it will be used in the next administration,” Cecil said. “I would like to see a connection with the environment and how that plays into all of these things, and especially how that will impact data in the years to come.”
