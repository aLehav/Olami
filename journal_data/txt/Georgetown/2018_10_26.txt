The National Coalition for Men, a nonprofit organization that advocates for men’s rights, filed a Title IX complaint alleging that Georgetown University discriminates against men in its hiring practices and by supporting organizations that provide outreach to women.
“Georgetown University is in violation of Title IX because it offers resources, funding, fellowships, and scholarships that are available to women only, even though men are a minority both nationwide [42 percent] and at Georgetown University [44 percent],” according to the summary of the complaint.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, nationwide in 2018, 43.56 percent of undergraduates in both two- and four-year institutions are male.
The complaint, filed to the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights on Oct. 3, lists 18 university-affiliated institutions through which, it claims, Georgetown violates Title IX or that, according to the complaint, violate Title IX themselves.
Georgetown has not yet been formally notified of the complaint by the Office of Civil Rights. If the OCR deems the case a violation of Title IX, the university will be notified, according to Campus Safety Magazine.
Title IX protects individuals from discrimination based on sex in education programs that receive federal funding, according to the Department of Education website.
The complaint calls for the dissolution of all female-only or female-biased groups, the conversion of female-focused programs into gender-neutral programs and the creation of equivalent male-focused programs to any remaining female-focused programs.
The university does not discriminate based upon sex, a university spokesperson said.
“Georgetown University is committed to an inclusive learning environment free from discrimination,” the university said in a statement. “Georgetown programs do not discriminate on the basis of sex and organizations on campus focused on gender equity are open to all genders.”
The complaint lists 18 organizations as alleged violators of Title IX, including the Cawley Career Education Center, the women and gender studies department, the Georgetown Women’s Center, the Georgetown Women’s Alliance, the Georgetown Women’s Foreign Policy Group and Women Who Code, among others.
The document accuses the university of hiring practices explicitly biased in favor of women and endorsement of outreach organizations such as Asian Women in Business, American Business Women’s Association, the Society of Women Engineers and Women in Technology.
“Georgetown University violates Title IX by expressing an unlawful preference for women in its employment/hiring practices: ‘it is the goal of Georgetown University and its departments to advertise, recruit vigorously, and employ qualified candidates, particularly minority persons, women, veterans, and persons with disabilities,’” the complaint reads. “This bias is systemic, since all applications go through the affirmative action process.”
Even though the intent of these institutions may not be to discriminate, their designation as women’s groups is enough to warrant a Title IX response, according to the document.
“The fact that these scholarships and programs are endorsed as ‘Women’s’ is sufficient, in and of itself, to infer disparate treatment,” the document reads. “Such endorsement has a clearly dissuasive/discriminatory effect on males.”
Title IX complaints can advance to federal investigations if the Office for Civil Rights finds them to be credible violations of law, according to the Department of Education. If the recipient of a Title IX complaint is determined by the investigation to have violated the law, it must either make the changes demanded by the Office of Civil Rights, risk loss of federal funding or face a referral to the Department of Justice, according to the Department of Education website.
Once a complaint is submitted to the Office for Civil Rights, government officials evaluate if they will further investigate. If the complaint passes for an investigation, the OCR will notify parties involved with a letter, according to the Campus Safety Magazine. If the OCR determines that a Title IX violation occurred, it will seek negotiations and attempt to sign a written resolution agreement with the school and the group filing the complaint.
The complaint also condemns Christine Fair, the School of Foreign Service professor who tweeted violent imagery about male senators during the hearings this month for then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Fair was placed on research leave after the tweets were condemned by faculty, students and alumni.
Fair should be terminated as a result of her “terroristic threats,” according to the complaint.
“[Fair] is an active and ongoing security threat to her male students, she cannot be expected to teach her male students in a fair manner, and her presence creates a hostile environment against young male students on campus,” the coalition wrote.
In recent months, NCFM filed similar complaints against several universities nationwide, including the University of Pennsylvania, Northeastern University and Yale University, and has filed Title IX complaints against other universities in the past. The complaints at the University of Pennsylvania and Northeastern are not currently pending investigation as of Sept. 28, according to the Office of Civil Rights and the investigation at Yale University began in April and is ongoing, according to the Yale Daily News.
This story was updated Oct. 31, 2018 at 3:34 p.m. with a new photo and to correct a previous statement that said that the National Coalition For Men includes a Washington, D.C. chapter. The organization does not have a D.C. chapter.

Until women are equally paid in academia (and industry), represent at least half of research grants and funding, and are proportionately represented in tenured and leadership positions, Title IX continue to help them. This effort is little more than an attention-getting nuisance suit.

Christine Fair is a horrible stain on Georgetown’s reputation. Her vitriol brought this lawsuit, and the fair thing to do would be to terminate Fair.

Karen — women already get paid on an equal basis with men. Single women make more than single men. Men work in more dangerous jobs. Women earn the majority of college degrees. Stop spreading misinformation.

Over half the student body at Georgetown are women. Over half the teaching positions are held by women. So what”s the beef?

Please be aware of facts before posting ignorant comments. Women are paid on an equal basis in some cases,  but this is in no way universal (especially in higher paying positions such as law, medicine, and business).  Female doctors earn an average of $100,000 less than their male counterparts. You are correct that equality has been attained in certain fields, and even inequality that men are more likely to work in physically dangerous position–but do not spread misinformation.  The wage gap is still very real, and in cases like medicine, very dramatic. Inequalities exist in both directions–to say otherwise is just factually incorrect and discredits any point you try to make. Educate yourself on both sides of the spectrum.

It is literally ridiculous to act like men are under attack when the same system they’re invoking now does nothing to protect women when they’re assaulted (although they love to pretend like their would-be friend Kavanaugh didn’t skate his way into a lifelong Supreme Court position after being accused of assaulting multiple women).
Instead of punching down and dismantling the systems created by women to feel confortable in academia (an institution, at least in our case, that was built for white land owning men), and maybe idk start a men’s support group (which is allowed! we have a men of color group, but I’m sure there weren’t too many involved in filing this complaint!) where they can figure out exactly where their parents failed in raising them with self-confidence and an at least cursory understanding of how power structures work.

Was this a response? I am reading it, and nothing you say makes sense.
1. “Literally ridiculous” isn’t a real phrase.
2. None of the accusations against Kavanaugh were credible in the least.
3. So, Georgetown has one throwaway group with a racial focus –“Men of Color” is not the same as “Men.” Does this balance all the female-only groups listed in the complaint? No.
4. Women rape and abuse men as often as vice versa. Feel free to check out Lara Stemple’s studies. We have no prosecution against such women thanks to radical feminists monopolizing female victimhood.

Georgetown University’s nearly 1,100 graduate student assistants are set to vote on whether or not to unionize, after a two-yearlong effort by the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees for university recognition of a graduate teaching assistant labor union.
The election, to be held between Nov. 5 and Nov. 8, is being moderated by the American Arbitration Association, a neutral third party.
Eligible students will be able to vote at Lauinger Library, the Intercultural Center, Regents Hall or the Preclinical Science Building between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. each day of the election.
The ballots are secret, and graduate students eligible to vote include doctoral, graduate or student research assistants; doctoral, graduate or student teaching assistants; and doctoral teaching associates.
Graduate student assistants, as they are called collectively, must either currently be holding one of these positions or have held one within the past two semesters to participate in the vote.
If GAGE wins the election, the organization will gain collective bargaining rights on stipend amounts, wage rates, benefits, hours and similar matters, according to the April 2 election agreement between the GAGE and the university. GAGE would not gain bargaining rights on academic issues like tuition rates or degree requirements.
Graduate student workers are not currently represented by a union and are paid at varying rates.
“We value our graduate students, who are an important part of our academic community,” Provost Robert Groves and Executive Vice President for Health Sciences Edward Healton wrote in an Oct. 22 universitywide email. “Georgetown is committed to continuing to enhance the resources provided to graduate students.”
Chad Frazier, a seventh-year doctoral student and former member of the GAGE Election Negotiation Committee, said holding the election is a key marker in the push to unionize.
“I think that the coming election will represent a major turning point for graduate student-workers at Georgetown,” Frazier wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Since GAGE first began to organize a union in January 2017, we’ve had thousands of conversations with graduate student-workers across campus about the issues that matter to them: stipends and hourly wages, health insurance, sexual harassment, transparency with job postings, parental and family leave, and much more!”
Douglas McRae, a graduate worker and fifth-year doctoral candidate in the department of history, said that the election will allow graduate students’ voices to be heard.
“This election is important for graduate workers because it is our chance to bring our collective voice to bear on our working conditions,” McRae wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We provide value to the ununiversity through our teaching and research, and the recognition of GAGE will allow us to improve the conditions in which we provide that value, as well as affirm Georgetown’s  commitment to social justice in the workplace.”
GAGE is affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers, a nationwide union representing over 1.7 million members. The vote presents two options, to unionize or to not, and if a majority vote in favor of unionization, GAGE and AFT will become the collective bargaining agent for all graduate student assistants, according to Georgetown University.
“I hope, of course, that we win our election, and by a large margin,” McRae said. “I hope not just that we win, but also that the administration recognizes those results and duly bargains with us as employees of Georgetown.”
GAGE filed to hold an election this semester on Oct. 8, putting the actual election almost a month after the initial filing. The election filing came nearly a year after GAGE first demanded university recognition and the start of contract negotiations Nov. 1, 2017.
Frazier, who worked on GAGE negotiations with the university, said conversations with graduate student workers demonstrated the importance of unionizing.
“These conversations have all underscored the need for an organization that can bargain with the administration on more or less equal footing,” Frazier wrote.
Following GAGE’s November 2017 letter asking for recognition, the university initially declined to recognize the organization Dec. 4, 2017. GAGE continued to negotiate with the university, and on April 2, 2018, announced an agreement to hold an election during the fall semester.
Over six months later, the upcoming election will determine the next steps for GAGE and graduate student assistants.
“Organizing is a way to connect workers and teachers across departments and make it easier for us to support each other,” Deidre Nelms, a teaching associate and fourth year doctoral candidate in the department of philosophy, said in an email to The Hoya. “When hundreds of us are united in a recognized union, we’ll be able to bargain with the university for an improved, stable contract.”
The university maintains that it is remaining neutral during the election, encouraging graduate students to learn more about unionization and to vote.
Graduate student teaching assistants are considered university employees under the regulations of the National Labor Relations Board since an August 2016 ruling. However, this ruling could be challenged in the future. A third-party organization administering the election ensures the result if the ruling is ever reversed and that the university cannot legally challenge the election outcome.
Graduate students at Harvard University held a similar election in November 2017 under the NLRB, and the students elected to form a union, according to The Washington Post. The university challenged the election, but the NLRB rejected the appeal in July 2017 and mandated that another election be held. The students voted again in April 2018 to form a union, according to The Washington Post.
Should Georgetown graduate students elect not to form a union in November, the university will continue to improve student worker conditions, according to Groves and Healton.
“Georgetown will continue its efforts to improve conditions for graduate students if a union is not elected and will bargain in good faith if one is elected,” Groves and Healton said.
This post has been updated at 12:10 a.m. on Oct. 29 to reflect the National Labor Relations Board’s classification of graduate student teaching assistants as employees.

Tanzanian billionaire and member of the Board of Advisors to the McDonough School of Business Mohammed Dewji (MSB ’98) returned home safely Oct. 20 after armed robbers abducted and held him for nine days.
Two masked gunmen seized Dewji outside of the Colosseum Hotel on Oct. 11 in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania’s largest city and commercial capital. Dewji’s abduction received international attention from news media, and his family offered nearly $500,000 for information that could lead to his return.
Police found Dewji nine days later in Dar Es Salaam around 3 a.m. after his captors released him uninjured. In a tweet attributed to Dewji from the account of the Mo Dewji Foundation, an organization he started to reduce poverty in Tanzania, Dewji announced his release.
“I thank Allah that I have returned home safely. I thank all my fellow Tanzanians, and everyone around the world for their prayers. I thank the authorities of Tanzania, including the Police Force for working for my safe return,” Dewji wrote in a tweet.
Dewji, 43, is Africa’s youngest billionaire, according to Forbes. Dewji formerly served in the Tanzanian Parliament and is currently the CEO of MeTL Group, a multinational corporation founded by his father, Gulamabbas Dewji, in the 1970s and Tanzania’s largest company, bringing in annual revenues of $1.5 billion, according to Quartz.
Dewji currently sits on the MSB’s Board of Advisors, and he has not only welcomed many Hoyas to Tanzania to assist in global study but also serves as an ambassador for the university and its values, MSB Dean Paul Almeida wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“As a longtime member of the McDonough School of Business Board of Advisors, Mo has been invaluable to the school’s efforts to be the best in the world and the best for the world,” Almeida said. “He blends his successful business career with a responsibility to give back to others, particularly in efforts to create sustainable avenues for eliminating poverty in Africa. Through philanthropy and civil service, has made a significant impact in Tanzania.”
Dewji said his abductors spoke a South African language, adding to police suspicions that his captors were foreigners. Dewji also told Tanzanian authorities that despite offering to pay ransom, his kidnappers did not accept any offers. The motive for the abduction is currently unknown, Tanzania’s Inspector General of Police Simon Sirro said.
“Mohammed Dewji told us that the kidnappers wanted money but were very afraid, even though they were armed. He asked them several times how much they wanted but they gave no figure,” Sirro said to Al Jazeera.
Police also recovered a car and assault rifle that the kidnappers attempted to destroy. Tanzanian police are still investigating the incident, Sirro told Al Jazeera.
“We now know their network; we know which country the plans were made,” Sirro said.
News of Dewji’s abduction also affected the Georgetown community, and Almeida said the community is thankful Dewji is unharmed and back home.
“We were saddened to hear of Mo Dewji’s abduction on October 11, and our entire community has been praying for his safety,” Almeida said. “We were relieved to hear the news that he was reunited with his loved ones over the weekend.”

The Nevils dormitory experienced multiple false fire alarms on the nights of Oct. 9 and 10, as well as the afternoon of Oct. 16.
An electronic circuit switch fail caused the false alarms, according to a joint statement made by Georgetown University Facilities Management and the Office of Residential Living in an email to East Campus residents Oct. 25. Nevils, an apartment-style residential community located on East Campus, houses mostly upperclassman students.
“Upon identifying the fault, we inspected the relevant system and repairs were made. We will continue to monitor the system and will perform tests if necessary,” the email said.
The Oct. 9 fire alarm sounded intermittently for over two hours, starting at around 2 a.m., according to Nevils resident Marshall Webb (SFS ’20). Residents evacuated from the building when the alarms sounded but became confused as the alarms continued and no police cars or fire trucks arrived at the scene, according to Charlotte Hine (MSB ’19).
“It was close to 25 minutes before we saw anyone of authority,” Hine wrote in an email to The Hoya. “At 4:30 a.m., someone who appeared to have authority finally told us that we could re-enter the building, and that facilities would shut off the alarm shortly. It took over 90 minutes to shut off the alarm.”
Students were given the all-clear to return to the building before the fire alarms were turned off, according to Webb.
The alarms sounding in the middle of the night posed a disruption to many students who were trying to sleep, Hine said.
“Many people chose not to go back into their apartments because the noise was too loud. Some slept in the hallways until the alarm stopped. I used earplugs and pillows to block the noise,” Hine said. “I had a job interview the following day. Others had early classes, midterms, and work commitments.”
Alex Mitchell (SFS ’21), another Nevils resident, echoed Hine’s sentiment that the fire alarms disrupted his sleep. On the second consecutive night of alarms, Mitchell left Nevils and slept on a friends’ couch in another dormitory.
“We sat on our little balcony while the sirens blared. We couldn’t even be inside,” Mitchell wrote in an email to The Hoya.
As the alarms continued, some students stopped leaving their apartments, according to Webb.
“With each evacuation, the number of people you see leave the building is lower and lower and lower,” Webb wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Hine emailed the Office of Residential Living to ask about the possibility of receiving a refund of the nightly rate of the housing fee for the two dates in question. Her request was denied.
“I was told they do not issue refunds for these types of issues,” Hine said.
Students will be notified of the cause of any future fire alarms, according to the email from the Georgetown University Facilities Management and the Office of Residential Living.
“In the spirit of open communication, we will notify all East Campus residents of the cause of each future fire alarm tests via e-mail within 12 hours of each event,” the email said.

Georgetown’s fifth annual Latinx Heritage Month concluded Oct. 15, after a month-long series of events stemming from collaborations between a range of campus organizations. On-campus programming will continue through Nov. 2, ending with celebrations for Dia de Los Muertos.
Collaboration between different Latinx student groups made a significant difference in planning the events this year, according to Mireya Iglesias-Ayala (MSB ’19), the cultural director of Georgetown’s Latin American Student Association, and Jose Ramos (MSB ’19), the president of Georgetown’s Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán, a national organization founded in the 1960s meant to foster unity among Chicanx individuals through political action.
“We really attempted to work more together in order to bring about all these events, especially for the Día de los Muertos week long celebration,” Iglesias-Ayala and Ramos wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are really content to have so many organizations on board promoting our cultures.”
Increased collaboration in planning served to bring together the Latinx community, Iglesias-Ayala said.
“This year we worked to have multiple orgs as hosts to promote unity amongst all Latinx orgs and the various cultures/social issues/traditions that exist in our diverse home countries that we bring with us here at Georgetown,” Iglesias-Ayala said. “Since most of us are seniors leading these orgs we wanted to make the effort to collaborate and bring about more cross functional leadership because that is what a community is supposed to be.”
Georgetown officially began commemorating Latinx Heritage Month in 2014, but students organized initiatives to celebrate Latinx Heritage Month over a decade earlier and to create a community on campus, according to Joseph Gomez (SFS ’19), resident director of La Casa Latina, which provides resources for Latinx students on campus and hosts events to share the narratives of these students.
“In 2002, a group of Georgetown University students designed a dinner event for the Latinx community on campus to take place during Latinx Heritage Month,” Gomez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Due to a lack of institutional support and interest, it was necessary to gather as a unified group of aware, resolute individuals.”
The schedule of events expanded dramatically in the following four years. Student organizations planned and hosted events to celebrate the month, beginning on the first day of National Hispanic Heritage Month on Sept. 15. These events include the 16th annual Latinx Leadership Forum and the first Spanish Mass of the fall semester.
The event schedule for this year’s Latinx Heritage Month will culminate with a Día de los Muertos celebration from Oct. 26 through Nov. 2 hosted by various organizations, including La Casa Latina and Campus Ministry. This year’s celebrations will include a Spanish liturgy hosted by Campus Ministry, according to Iglesias-Ayala.
“Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) is a celebration to honor those that have passed,” Iglesias-Ayala said. “We will be having various altars around campus to commemorate our loved ones who have passed. Spanish Mass will be included in the normal liturgical order of the masses.”
Latinx Heritage Month is significant in the ways it empowers and creates community for Latinx-identifying students at Georgetown, according to Iglesias-Ayala and Rocío Mondragón Reyes (SFS ’19), the logistics coordinator of Ballet Folklórico Mexicano de Georgetown, a dance group that performs traditional Mexican dances on and off campus.
“The overall hope is that with these various events of celebration, those of us who identify as Latinx, can each find space and time in celebrating, acknowledging and sharing our culture amongst the rest of the Georgetown Latinx community and the community at large,” Iglesias-Ayala and Reyes said. “It is a way to remind us of our identity as a community and to celebrate it.”
Latinx Heritage Month  has also led to the creation of other community-building initiatives for Latinx students at Georgetown, including the formation of La Casa Latina, according to Gomez.
“Our success [in 2014], led us to contemplate and mobilize on other important issues our community faces here on the Hilltop. Thus, the movement to start a Casa Latina for Hoyas was born,” Gomez said. “On April 10, 2015, LLF and the Last Campaign for Academic Reform (LCAR) submitted our respective proposals and petitions to university administrators. After various meetings with administration, Casa Latina was established for the Fall of 2016.”
Iglesias-Ayala, Reyes and Ramos said they are pleased with the outcome of this year’s celebration and look forward to the continuation of significant, increasingly strong Latinx presence on campus.
“There is simply an overall hope to continue to strengthen our presence and alliances amongst each other so that the generations to come have a space and means through which they can celebrate and share their Latinx identity,” the trio said. “Given that we now have a physical space, Casa Latina, we just seek to ensure that the student run organizations continue in strength so that this space can be used to its full potential.”

A Georgetown University Student Association effort to make Georgetown a smoke- and tobacco-free campus seeks to collaborate with Students of Georgetown, Inc., more commonly known as the Corp, to end tobacco and nicotine sales in Hoya Snaxa and Vital Vittles.
GUSA Policy Chair for Student Health Casey Kozak (NHS ’20) sent an email to the personal email of Corp CEO Alex Gong (SFS ’20), copying two other Corp employees, asking them to speak with her about eliminating sales of tobacco products and replacing them with contraceptives Oct. 10.
“I would like to meet with you and discuss a possible collaboration of working to replace nicotine sales on campus with contraceptives, which I believe could off-set [sic] the loss of profit,” Kozak wrote in the email.
The Corp representatives did not respond to Kozak’s email and Chairman of The Corp Ricardo Mondolfi (SFS ’19) said he was not aware of the email until his Oct. 23 interview with The Hoya.
“We have not been contacted by anyone in the community about our tobacco sales,” Mondolfi said in a phone message he left before an interview with The Hoya. “It’s an issue we discuss and continue to look at.”
Kozak created two surveys and sent them in the GUSA weekly email Oct. 24. The first asks about students’ opinions on tobacco and nicotine sales on campus, and the second asks about students’ opinions about the sale of contraceptives, which, Kozak said, could replace tobacco in Vittles and Snaxa. No on-campus vendor at Georgetown currently sells contraceptives, because it would violate their lease agreements with the university, which does not support or affiliate with any groups that offer contraceptives.
The Corp has not yet seriously deliberated ending tobacco product sales, Mondolfi said.
“There’s not even been an internal deliberation about this,” Mondolfi said. “It’s just we have sold tobacco products for who knows how long, certainly since I came to Georgetown, and the nature of it is that we’re going to continue doing it until we decide not to, and we just haven’t sat down to have that conversation.”
The Corp would collaborate with GUSA on the issue of eliminating the sale of tobacco products on campus, Mondolfi said.
“We’re happy and ready to begin a conversation with GUSA as we have on many other issues in the past,” Mondolfi said. “We closely collaborated with them, and this is certainly an issue that we’re happy to engage on, and a lot of members of Corp leadership feel very strongly on this issue as well.”
The Corp will consider student health, morals and finances as it decides whether to stop selling tobacco products, Mondolfi said. The Corp brings in $5.5 million in revenue annually, according to Mondolfi, but he could not offer any information about what percentage of that revenue comes from tobacco sales.
In 2016, a majority of students voted in support of making campus tobacco-free in a schoolwide referendum. GUSA is pushing the university to meet its goal of going tobacco- and smoke-free by 2018, GUSA Press Secretary Jonathon Marek (SFS ’21) said.
“University administrators have made clear that Georgetown is in the process of becoming a smoke- and tobacco-free campus, with full implementation expected by the end of this academic year,” Marek wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The administration must provide additional clarity on its plans for a smoke- and tobacco-free campus to align with its stated goal and to allow GUSA and others to examine its proposals and determine if they are in the best interest of the student body at large.”

Mr. Mondolfi needs a PR lesson says 
October 28, 2018 at 7:39 pm
The fact that the “chair” of a board’s justification is “the nature of it is that we’re going to continue doing it until we decide not to” is appalling. 
The arrogance of outwardly denying the existence of an email as well as justifying his stance by saying that tobacco has been sold “for who knows how long, certainly since I came to Georgetown” is ridiculous, as if he is an administrator that has been at the school for decades. The Corp needs a more comprehensive response or at least a more competent person to respond to campus media.

The Georgetown University Student Association announced the names of its 13 new executive board members Oct. 21.
These executive positions were left vacant following the Sept. 11 resignation of former GUSA President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) and the Sept. 14 resignations of former GUSA Vice President Naba Rahman (SFS ’19) and Chief of Staff Aaron Bennett (COL ’19).
After ascending to the positions of president and vice president respectively, Juan Martinez (COL ’20) and Kenna Chick (COL ’20) released applications for the executive board Oct. 7.
Chick and Martinez aim to focus the administration’s efforts on three primary tenets: transparency, health and advocacy, according to Chick.
Chick and Martinez appointed Alejandro Garcia Escobar (SFS ’21) as chief of staff, and Anna Naiyapatana (SFS ’21) as executive treasurer. Varsha Menon (SFS ’21) will serve as the director of student engagement, and Nav Khaira (COL ’21) will be the deputy director of student engagement.
Jack Pelose (COL ’19) and Casey Doherty (COL ’20) will serve as the director of university affairs and the director of campus affairs, respectively. Darcy Palder (COL ’21) has been appointed director of communications, and Victoria McFadden (SFS ’20) will take over the position of director of student affairs. Madison Alvarez (COL ’21) and Sonia Adjroud (SFS ’20) will serve as co-directors of student activism.
The new executive board held a GUSA Expo on Oct. 21 to introduce themselves to the student body and highlight opportunities for students to get involved in GUSA.
McFadden wants to use her role in GUSA to establish fundraising programs to benefit students, such as the Hoya Hub, Georgetown’s on-campus student-run food pantry, she said.
Menon hopes to ensure that GUSA can be more representative of all students at Georgetown and that it will serve the diverse student body of the university.
“I’m hoping to use my position as director of student engagement to encourage greater representation of diverse and intersectional voices on this campus, while simultaneously establishing stronger relationships with the student body,” Menon said. “As this current administration works to rebuild a lot of the issues that have weakened GUSA, we as senior staff hope to do more for the student body by reaching out to them.”
The student engagement team plans to improve relations between GUSA and the student body through outreach efforts, according to Menon.
“My team and I are working to have more transparent outreach to the Georgetown community,” Menon said. “We would also like to provide feedback avenues so we can better learn how to serve Georgetown.”
In an email to all undergraduate students, members of the GUSA executive encouraged students to contact any member of the executive board with projects in which they are interested.
“Please do not hesitate to reach out to any one of us, we are so excited to work with you,” GUSA executive members wrote.

Empowering lay members and changing church culture are necessary for the Catholic Church to address sexual abuse, panelists agreed at a discussion held in the Dahlgren Chapel on Wednesday.
The panelists examined the best path forward for the Catholic Church in light of the sexual abuse allegations that have surfaced against several members of the church, including former cardinal Theodore McCarrick and Cardinal Donald Wuerl.
The panel included Anne Burke, a justice on the Supreme Court of Illinois and former interim chair of the National Review Board for the Protection of Children and Young People of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops; Rev. Gerard J. McGlone, S.J., Ph.D., psychologist and associate director of Protection of Minors for the Conference of Major Superiors of Men; Erica Lizza (SFS ’19), president of Catholic Women at Georgetown; and Kerry Robinson (CAS ’88), founding executive director and global ambassador of the Leadership Roundtable. (Full disclosure: Lizza is a member of The Hoya’s editorial board.)
John Carr, director of the Georgetown University Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, moderated the discussion.
The empowerment of laypeople could hold the church more accountable on issues such as cases of sexual assault and could force a shift in the church’s culture, Burke said.
“Until the laypeople are involved and know what the procedures are and what the rules are, I don’t know what we can do,” Burke said. “We have to make sure we draft those procedures.”
The problem of sexual abuse within the church remains ongoing, Burke said.
“This isn’t 50 years ago,” Burke said. “It’s still happening, so the culture is continuing.”
Civil authorities should step in to ensure the church undergoes a true cultural shift, Burke said. She also criticized the church for failing to incorporate the critiques of external review boards.
“I don’t see us getting into the culture unless we stand straight to them and force them,” Burke said, calling on the audience to place more pressure on their priests and bishops to implement reforms.
Wuerl resigned as archbishop of Washington, D.C., on Oct. 12 amid criticism over his handling of sexual abuse cases when he served as bishop in the Diocese of Pittzburgh. Wuerl remains the interim archbishop while the Archdiocese of Washington searches for a replacement, per the request of Pope Francis.
McCarrick resigned from the College of Cardinals in July following an allegation of sexual abuse. Since his resignation, four people have come forward with allegations of sexual abuse, which the Vatican is currently investigating. McCarrick served as Wuerl’s predecessor as archbishop of Washington, D.C, until 2006. Both McCarrick and Wuerl hold honorary degrees from Georgetown.
McCarrick has denied the allegation, and Wuerl has defended his actions while in the Diocese of Pittsburgh.
Bishops should “come clean” by proactively releasing documents and files that could indicate whether, and to what extent, they were complicit in the cover-up of sexual abuse, Burke said. Releasing such information would be an opportunity to show accountability, as dioceses across the country have received federal subpoenas, she said.
“It’s like substance abuse or alcoholism, where you hit rock bottom,” Burke said. “Until we know everything that’s going on, there’s no way for us to heal.”
McGlone, as a psychologist who has treated abusers, called for increased transparency in the church to begin changing the culture.
“Enough of the policy, enough of the criminal approach, enough of another report,” McGlone said. “We have to have significant cultural change and monitor that change.”
The Georgetown community should work with other Catholic universities to create a working group on addressing the issue, McGlone said.
The university should conduct an internal investigation on ways in which it is complicit in ignoring abuse, according to Lizza. Georgetown should also revoke the honorary degrees currently held by Wuerl and McCarrick, Lizza said.
“As to why this hasn’t been greenlighted or moving faster, I think it’s the same old culture of thinking that if we ignore it, it will go away,” Lizza said.
The university should also continue holding events that foster conversation about abuse in the Catholic Church and should host community outreach with students, Lizza said.
The Vatican needs to overhaul its system of promoting and selecting bishops in order to include women in Catholic leadership, according to Robinson.
“Why not have women serving on the congregation of bishops?” Robinson said. “We should be ashamed of ourselves as a church for underutilizing women. That is a terrible example of stewardship.”
The event showed the church’s reflection on its internal problems, rather than addressing issues like nuclear weapons, immigration, and racism, which Dahlgren dialogues have historically focused on, Carr said.

Acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons Hugh Hurwitz mandated that the residential re-entry management center that wins the next five-year contract from the BOP will be required to accept all high-risk prisoners, according to an Oct. 11 news release.
The BOP addresses all issues related to the federal and Washington, D.C. prison systems, according to the BOP’s website. Because the federal government functions as a state government for the District, the BOP implemented its new policy without the D.C. Council voting on the issue. BOP contracts residential re-entry management program centers, also known as halfway houses, to provide support and housing for inmates close to being released.
The BOP is looking to replace or renew its current contract with Hope Village, the halfway house currently holding the five-year contract, according to the Oct. 11 news release. Fifty percent of inmates who return to Washington, D.C. are re-incarcerated within three years of release, according to The Washington Post.
The new contract received immediate backlash from Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, who condemned the policy in a Oct. 11 news release on her website. Norton expressed concern that inmates accused of harming children could be settled close to places where many children are located.
“We must strongly contest this new decision to condition the contract on agreeing to accept child predators, even for facilities that may be located near schools, child care facilities and other places where children congregate,” Norton said in the news release. “Due to its high density, almost all locations in the District are within 1,000 feet of areas where children congregate.”
The BOP will have to balance public safety with the need to provide crucial support and resources to formerly incarcerated offenders necessary for them to reintegrate after their release, Marc Morjé Howard, director of the Prisons and Justice Initiative at Georgetown, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“There is no easy solution to this dilemma. While the concern over sex offenders is understandable and real, finding effective ways to support returning citizens is one of the greatest challenges we face in the context of criminal justice reform,” Howard said. “Many formerly incarcerated individuals do succeed in becoming productive, responsible, and fully-engaged members of our community.”
Instead of incorporating judicial or legislative approval, the BOP used its contracting power with residential re-entry management programs to change policy, Norton said in the Oct. 11 news release.
“This new requirement appears to be a policy, not a statutory, decision,” Norton said. “Therefore, this change is unwarranted, unworkable, untenable and unacceptable.”
The concern over high-risk prisoners being allowed in residential re-entry management program housing neglects the needs of returning citizens, Howard said.
“By focusing attention on a few of the most difficult cases, we tend to dehumanize these individuals and raise the general level of fear around the larger issue of returning citizens,” he said. “As a result, we then fail to come up with more nuanced solutions that recognize the range of personalities and circumstances involved (not unlike assuming falsely that all immigrants are violent gang members).”
Norton previously challenged the BOP for failing to evacuate inmates during natural disasters in a Nov. 1, 2017 news release from her website. After her statement, she met with then-BOP Director Mark Inch to discuss the matter.
BOP has not yet responded to Norton’s letter on this specific issue. However, earlier in October, Norton petitioned the BOP to relocate juvenile inmates from D.C. to facilities closer to the city, according to an Oct. 4 news release. This letter has also received no response.

The Archdiocese of Washington released the names of 31 priests who were considered “credibly accused” of sexual abuse toward minors in the last 70 years on Oct. 15.
The list includes 28 ordained priests of the archdiocese and three religious order or non-diocesan priests, with details under each name revealing the actions taken by the archdiocese following reports of abuse. Seventeen of the named priests are deceased.
The list was the product of an internal review ordered in 2017 by Cardinal Donald Wuerl, former archbishop of Washington, according to the Oct. 15 news release. Pope Francis accepted Wuerl’s resignation from the archbishop position Oct. 12 after Wuerl received criticism for enabling sexual abuse during his tenure as bishop of the Pittsburgh Diocese. The accusations against Wuerl surfaced in a Pennsylvania grand jury report released Aug. 1
The list serves as a reminder of the ongoing effects of sexual abuse in the church, Wuerl said in the Oct. 15 news release.
“This list is a painful reminder of the grave sins committed by clergy, the pain inflicted on innocent young people, and the harm done to the Church’s faithful, for which we continue to seek forgiveness,” Wuerl said.
Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests criticized the list as incomplete, arguing several credible accusations had been left out and jeopardized the integrity of the list. Six of the names had not previously been made public, according to The Washington Post.
“As it is, today’s disclosure appears to be a hastily assembled PR stunt, not a comprehensive effort to inform parishioners and citizens in Washington, D.C. about the extent of the scandal there,” SNAP said in an Oct. 15 news release.
The internal review remains ongoing and the archdiocese will update the published list if necessary, Archdiocese Director of Media and Public Relations Chieko Noguchi wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Oct. 15 archdiocese news release reveals cases of priests who were credibly accused but were reinstated to ministry, including Thomas Schaefer, who was first accused of sexual abuse in 1967. Schaefer returned to ministry only to be reported again in 1982, and returned another time in 1983 before being permanently removed from parish ministry in 1986. Schaefer was arrested in 1995 and convicted in 1996 of sexual molestation, according to The Washington Post.
The archdiocese has not found a credible allegation in nearly 20 years, and no priest in active ministry in the archdiocese has been subject to a credible sexual abuse allegation, according to Noguchi.
Noguchi did not elaborate on the archdiocese’s process of determining whether an accusation against a priest is considered credible.
The move was an important step in both coming to terms with the existence of abuse and demonstrating accountability for those who abuse or enable abuse, according to Erica Lizza (SFS’19), president of Catholic Women at Georgetown. (Full Disclosure: Lizza is a member of The Hoya’s Editorial Board.)
“We hope that this and other efforts to cultivate transparency on the part of the Archdiocese can prevent future abuse and promote healing for the Church,” Lizza wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The release comes after disarray in the Washington Archdiocese following Wuerl’s resignation. Theodore McCarrick, archbishop emeritus of Washington, D.C., resigned in July from the College of Cardinals following multiple allegations of sexual abuse. Both McCarrick and Wuerl have honorary degrees from Georgetown University. The Vatican is currently conducting an internal investigation into allegations against McCarrick.

Media organizations exacerbate discrimination against immigrants without documentation by misconstruing the role that immigrants play in the United States, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas said at a Gaston Hall event on Wednesday.
The language used to describe immigrants without documentation in the media perpetuates the belief that immigrants without documentation do not contribute to the U.S. economy, Vargas said.
“I have lied my way through my career in journalism. I felt guilty I had to lie just to get a job. Undocumented workers contribute billions of dollars in taxes and social security and people don’t realize that,” Vargas said. “The master narrative and how we talk about ‘illegal aliens’ in the country is what propelled Donald Trump to the presidency. The media, specifically the media in D.C., has been complicit in that.”
Vargas won a Pulitzer Prize in 2008 as part of the Washington Post team that covered the 2008 Virginia Tech shootings, according to NPR. He was also nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary for his 2015 documentary “White People,” which addressed issues of race and identity in the United States.
Vargas is the CEO of Define American, a nonprofit media organization that uses storytelling to advocate for immigrant rights and fight discrimination. His new book “Dear America: Notes of an Undocumented Citizen,” chronicles the story of his life as an immigrant without documentation. Vargas said he will donate his honorarium from the event to UndocuHoyas, a student group that advocates for the rights of students without documentation.
Vargas reframed the issue of immigration for those without documentation as an issue about families.
“We can’t talk about the policies and politics of these issues until we understand the human part of this issue,” Vargas said. “This issue is not about immigration reform, not about border control or walls, it’s about families. Immigration has always been about families.”
The evangelical community offers a support network for immigrants without documentation in the United States and helps them feel more integrated into U.S. society, according to Vargas.
“I was at an event in Georgia, and I met a young Guatemalan man who said that he didn’t realize that white people liked him until they got into church, because that’s where they hugged,” Vargas said.  “I remember he told me ‘When I walk into that church, I don’t need papers to be equal under the eyes of God.’”
Vargas, who only discovered that he did not have documentation when he was 16, said that the imperative for him to hide his identity damaged many of friendships and presented him with a personal struggle with his identity.
“Being in the undocumented closet was tough because I realized I wasn’t just hiding from the government, but I was hiding from myself,” Vargas said.
Despite the challenges that Vargas faced as an immigrant without documentation in the United States, his experience and time in the United States allowed him to achieve his professional and personal success, he said.
“It’s almost like America is one big dare: We are all being dared to dream as big as we can and find windows that reopen when doors close, to remind ourselves to be grateful,” Vargas said. “Even though [the United States] doesn’t know what it wants to do with me, it has dared me to be the person that I am.”
Minority communities in the United States must overcome their differences to advocate against discrimination, Vargas said.
“I think this is a time for us to figure out what bridges have to be built. In the immigrant rights movement we don’t do enough with the African-American community,” Vargas said. “We cut each other into pieces and create borders where there are none.”
First-generation college students can play a crucial role in reshaping culture in the United States, according to Vargas.
“First-generation college students are remaking America and what civic participation looks like,” Vargas said. “I used the word ‘citizen’ very deliberately because that’s what we have to have in common.”
He encouraged students without documentation to participate in U.S. politics despite their immigration status and to redefine what it means to be a citizen.
“I would argue that there’s a citizenship that is deeper than the law you pass and the papers you have and what you are born to,” Vargas said. “There is a citizenship of participation and we have to participate and really engage.”

Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) signed legislation Oct. 18, establishing the office of nightlife and culture to serve as the intermediary between residents and late night venues.
The position was created in response to Washington, D.C.’s booming nightlife industry, which encompasses 2,267 bars and restaurants, rakes in $3.8 billion in sales and employs 68,900 people, according to the National Restaurant Association.
The office, which will be led by a chosen director of nightlife, will be tasked with promoting D.C.’s nightlife culture, while also ensuring that the needs of residents are not neglected as the industry grows.
“We know that this creates fantastic opportunities as well as a few challenges,” Bowser said in reference to the growing nightlife scene in the district, in an Oct. 18 news release. “And the Office of Nightlife and Culture is going to ensure that we’re working across D.C. Government, with our residents and businesses, to ensure a vibrant D.C. nightlife that works for everyone.”
The legislation was introduced in November 2017 by Councilmember Brandon Todd (D-Ward 4), who sees the position as an opportunity to coordinate the various interests surrounding D.C. nightlife.
“This new office will help ensure that all stakeholders are working together to address concerns such as parking, noise, and litter, and that new and existing establishments have help cutting red tape as they seek to expand opportunities in neighborhoods across the District,” Todd said in the press release at the bill’s signing.
D.C. joins a fast-growing list of cities around the world with an office to deal specifically with nightlife. Though the title varies, New York City, Orlando, London, Iowa City and other cities have established similar positions, according to The Washington Post.
Interest in the position has been unprecedented, with the position receiving more applications than any other cabinet position, according to The Washington Post.
“This job, man. People are excited about it. Around the country, across the oceans,” Lindsey Parker, Bowser’s deputy chief of staff, told The Washington Post.
Applications are being accepted online and are open to all residents of the District or anyone willing to relocate within 180 days of getting the job. Ideally, the director will be someone that has experience in both public policy and the hospitality industry, Todd told The Washington Post.
The full-time position pays a $97,434 to $118,000 yearly salary. Applications will be accepted until the position is filled with a suitable candidate.
The Office of Nightlife and Culture will also include five volunteers that will work under the director. Additionally, the director will meet quarterly with a 15-member Commission of Nightlife, which will include voices from business, residential and government interests.
As with all legislation passed in the District, the Mayor’s signing begins a 30-day review period in Congress before the law takes effect and the position is officially established.

The Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative recently named its eighth annual cohort of Entrepreneurs-in-Residence, a team of entrepreneurs and investors who will spend time on campus throughout the academic year to advise both undergraduate and graduate students on starting their own companies.
The EiRs for the 2018-19 year are: Laura Clark; David Fogel (SFS ’93, LAW ’97, GRD ’97); Talia Fox; Shye Gilad (GRD’12); Patricia Henriques; John Jabara; Jay Kenny (COL ’95); Fiona Macaulay; Mike Malloy (COL ’12); Peter Mellen (COL ’89, GRD ’98); Miguel Monteverde; Jill Monk; Meghan Roman (MSB ’96); Mark Silverman (MSB ’72, LAW ’75); Marc Steren; Dave Terzian (COL ’76); Tien Wong and Khuram Zaman.
The Entrepreneur-in-Residence Program focuses on connecting Georgetown students to a diverse network of accomplished alumni, industry experts, and business executives.
Throughout the term, these EiRs hold office hours and weekly chalk talks, where they discuss their experiences in the startup world and provide networking opportunities between students and EiRs, according to Jake Yoon (SFS ’19), who has attended these events. Georgetown students are also able to reach out and schedule one-on-one meetings or calls.
Yoon highlighted that EiRs can be helpful regardless of where one is in their entrepreneurship journey. Prior knowledge or experience of entrepreneurship is not necessary to sit down and chat with an EiR.
Ahmed Ibrahim (MSB ’22) said that speaking with EiRs can spark a newfound interest in entrepreneurship.
“I think often times the common thought about entrepreneurship is that it’s innate, but I think it’s really cool that in McDonough, you have so many opportunities and so many experts to consult with. Just by talking with them, you can realize certain aspects about yourself that you didn’t before,” Ibrahim said in an interview with The Hoya.
Peter Mellen, founder of Netcito, emphasized the importance of mentorship in launching a startup.
“I made virtually every mistake in the book along the way. Probably the biggest mistake was not seeking more mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs. Getting the right advice at the early stage of launching a business can be a game-changer for a founding team,” Mellen wrote in an email to The Hoya.
EiRs can support students in their entrepreneurial endeavors in a number of ways.
“When coaching students, we often use the phrase, ‘nail it before you scale it.’ Students often skip steps along the path to building a business… As Entrepreneurs in Residence, we help students test their business model and prove demand for their product with minimal investment,” Mellen said.
“I am an early stage investor and much of what I do in my working life is very relevant to students who are trying to move their ideas and startups forward… I have invested in and been in a number of businesses in my career and it gives me a perspective that I can share with the Georgetown Community,” Mark Silverman, a venture investor, wrote in an email toThe Hoya.
“Where I think I’m able to help the most is to get students to think more critically about their ideas and whether or not there’s a real business opportunity. It all starts with ‘What problem are you trying to solve for your customer?’ If the student has a clear and defensible answer to that question… then they’ve got a huge head start and the greatest chance of success,” Miguel Monteverde, a D.C.-based tech and media executive, said in an email to the Hoya.
Tien Wong, chairman and CEO of Tech2000, who has been involved in the Entrepreneur-in-Residence program for the past six years, spoke to the rewarding nature of being a part of such a program.
“I have always felt that it is incumbent on those who are fortunate and who have achieved some degree of success to always seek to give back. I have had the good fortune of having had a lot of help and mentorship in my journey, and only feel it fitting to be able to provide guidance and mentorship to students as a small way of giving back,” Wong wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Entrepreneur in Residence Program was founded under the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative with the support of Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business.
Under the banner of StartupHoyas, the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative provides a plethora of academic, extracurricular, and off-campus programs, with the overarching goal of creating a culture of entrepreneurship on campus, according to the StartupHoyas website.
The four facets of the initiative are encouraging entrepreneurial spirit, teaching about entrepreneurship, connecting students to a community of innovators, and encouraging students to launch their own new ventures, according to the StartupHoyas website.
Mellen, who has been involved with the Entrepreneurship Initiative since it was started eight years ago, said that the initiative has made substantial progress towards its original goals.
“Entrepreneurship education was virtually nonexistent when I was a student at Georgetown,” Mellen said. “Now we have an entrepreneurship minor, the Entrepreneur in Residence program, the Venture Lab, multiple student clubs, and many other resources for aspiring entrepreneurs.  It’s thrilling to be part of this growth.”
