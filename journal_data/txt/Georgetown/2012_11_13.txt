The university will convert its wireless coverage entirely to SaxaNet and GuestNet by Nov. 14, at which time the unsecured HOYAS network will be removed from all access points on campus.
The change was announced in a broadcast email sent from University Information Services Associate Director William Anderson Friday night.
Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis cited the lack of security and openness of HOYAS as reasons for eliminating the network.
“HOYAS is insecure, and it doesn’t have appropriate security controls,” she wrote in an email.“HOYAS permits all outbound access which can let compromised computers attack other machines.”
Throughout this semester, UIS has warned students and staff about phishing incidents, which include the attempt to acquire personal information — username, passwords and bank accounts — through phony emails.
UIS released its fourth notification in 2012 about a phishing incident Friday, an hour after the announcement of the complete change to SaxaNet.
SaxaNet provides encryption for all wireless traffic, which prevents hackers from accessing private information.
The university also plans to expand Wi-Fi access in the southwest corner of campus, installing 81 new wireless routers in New South and 214 such devices in the Southwest Quad by spring 2013, according to Davis.
“Funding has been approved, and UIS is working with [Georgetown University Facilities and Student Housing] and the contractors to schedule the work in student rooms,” Davis wrote.
But many students remain frustrated by unreliable Wi-Fi connections in certain parts of campus, especially the Southwest Quad.
“It’s very slow,” Southwest Quad resident Rachel Park (SFS ’13) said. “I don’t know if it’s just my computer or my location, but sometimes I have to log in like every two minutes. In my room, I have to use a cable to get some workable Internet.”

Though many of Georgetown’s peer institutions are becoming smoke and tobacco free, the university currently has no plans to implement a similar ban.
American University made an announcement Nov. 5 that it will enact a campus-wide smoking ban in 2013. According to an Oct. 5 American Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation newsletter, it joins more than 600 college campuses nationwide.
In addition, The George Washington University will soon announce a smoke-free policy effective beginning in the 2013 school year Nov. 15, according to the GW Hatchet.
In a memorandum to the AU campus community, University President Neil Kerwin cited health reasons as the driving force behind the new policy.
“The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that tobacco use in any form, active or passive, is a significant health hazard,” Kerwin said. “There is no safe level of exposure.”
But Maria Riquezes, a sophomore at American, was critical of the impending ban.
“I have heard people say that this move is a logical next step to earn some sort of environmental award,” Riquezes said. “I personally know that it’s going to be very hard for some students to deal with. I think college is an adult environment, and the ban somehow makes it seem childish.”
Though the Georgetown University Medical Center is smoke-free, the university does not have plans to ban smoking on the rest of campus, according to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh.
GUMC became smoke free Jan. 2011, according to an email sent Jan. 3 from Executive Dean of the School of Medicine Howard Federoff to Medical Center staff. Federoff cited the university’s Jesuit values as the basis for the ban.
“Our smoke-free policy helps us … care for the whole person and community,” he wrote.
On the main campus, smoking is currently prohibited in all indoor locations and within 25 feet of building entrances and windows, as required by D.C. law.
Some students, however, were in support of creating a smoke-free environment on campus.
“I hate having to walk by all of the smokers outside of [Lauinger Library] every day,” Colin Sawyer (SFS ’16) said. “I think that Georgetown should implement a smoke-free policy … [so] college students are discouraged from starting or continuing to smoke. It would protect the health of students from both first- and secondhand smoke while making the campus much cleaner.”
Other students felt the university should not regulate smoking on campus.
“I don’t think the university should implement a totally smoke-free policy,” Alex Barnes (SFS ’16) said. “It would be very inconvenient for smokers to have to walk off campus to smoke several times a day. I think there are better ways of dealing with the problem that protect clean air for non-smokers while minimizing the restrictions on smokers.”
Students on both sides of the issue added that smoking does not seem to be a priority for the university, nor is it a major issue on campus.
“Most of the roundtables and other discussions have been about food [and] technology, which I think are more important to a larger section of the student body and the school,” Andrew Haddad (SFS ’15) said. “I don’t think there is a huge smoking community at Georgetown, though people certainly still do it.”

According to a June press release from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, vending machines were supposed to be installed in all stations by September. However, WMATA decided to delay the installation after disability advocates complained about a lack of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The newest machines, which cost $12,000 each, are universally accessible because of features that allow both sight- and hearing-impaired Metro riders to use them.
Though older machines without such features remain in some stations, they will be replaced in 2013.
Previously, public transit users had to purchase SmarTrip cards at vendors such as CVS and Safeway or order them online.
The installation of the machines is the latest of many steps in WMATA’s plan to replace all paper fare cards with SmarTrip cards. Eighty-four percent of Metrorail users and 90 percent of Metrobus users now use a SmarTrip card, according to The Washington Post.
The change comes after WMATA began charging an additional dollar on top of the normal Metro fares for paper fare cards this July. In comparison, SmarTrip cards can be purchased for $5 and allow access to all of D.C.’s public transportation systems in addition to several regional bus services, such as Fairfax Connector and Loudoun County Transit.

Half the Sky, a global advocacy group that seeks to empower women and girls, formed a new branch at Georgetown this semester.
Moriah Lenhart-Wees (COL’13) was inspired to create Georgetown’s Half the Sky chapter after reading the book “Half The Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide.” The book, which was co-authored by New York Times journalists Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, tells the stories of individual women who overcame oppression through economic and educational opportunity.
According to Lenhart-Wees, college students will form a key component of the movement.
“One of the ways that the authors of the book are seeking to spread awareness about their campaign is through college students,” she said.
Currently, Georgetown’s chapter includes five ambassadors who act as liaisons between other chapters throughout the world
“Half the Sky is not going to acquire club status, per say,” Lenhart-Wees said. “We are part of the GU Circle of Women, and we’re going to work within that organization while communicating with the international Half the Sky movement.”
Fellow Half the Sky ambassador Stephanie Arzate (SFS ’15) also joined the group after reading Kristof and WuDunn’s book.
“As the title of the book itself says, women hold up half the sky,” Arzate said. “I do not believe that a country can reach its full potential if its women are not given the equal opportunities to lead and learn. More than anything, I hope that our tenure as campus ambassadors allows others to understand more about how female empowerment truly is the key to solving some of the most critical issues the world faces.”
Kristof and WuDunn encouraged readers to take action in their own communities and educate their friends and family about the challenges that women face in the developing world.
The book, which was published in 2009, rose to the number one position on the New York Times’ non-fiction bestseller list after its release. The authors have also partnered with PBS and several celebrity actresses, including America Ferrera and Meg Ryan, to air a four-part miniseries.
Georgetown’s Half the Sky chapter will hold its first event, a screening of part of the miniseries Nov. 13 in the Intercultural Center auditorium. The Georgetown University Circle of Women and the Georgetown Women’s Center are cosponsoring the event.
“Our call to action … was to bring the whole idea of Half The Sky to campus through the film and other venues of action, and that definitely aligns with the type of work that GU Circle of Women tries to promote,” said Katia Teran (SFS ‘13), president of GU Circle of Women and a Half the Sky ambassador.
“The film is just the introductory portion of our project,” Lenhart-Wees said. “We’re showing it to explain to people what the Half the Sky movement is.”
The screening will emphasize the importance of education and economic empowerment for women.
Lenhart-Wees said that the main difference between Half the Sky and other women’s advocacy groups on campus is its ability to form partnerships with grassroots organizations around the world.
“I believe that working directly with the women who are themselves experiencing oppression and not through an outside aid organization is a much more effective way to empower them,” Lenhart-Wees said. “Our goal is to work with those women in communities all over the world to bring to life the solutions they themselves have already come up with. … I just want people on Georgetown’s campus to realize that the world is bigger than Georgetown and that although women on our campus are doing pretty well, we should extend that and try to help women around the world reach that level of education.”
Teran agreed.
“Women and girls in the developing face issues that impact issues on a larger scale,” she said. “We need to change the hearts and minds of both boys and girls and raise the value that these societies assign to their women.”

The Cura Personalis Initiative, a new student-run effort, will seek to address issues of diversity on campus and bolster students’ perceptions of the university’s identity.
Spearheaded by Guadalupe Fernandez (SFS ’14), president of the organization, and Zenen Jaimes Perez (SFS ’13), the initiative was launched in September, when students from the Georgetown Solidarity Committee and the Vietnamese Student Association began raising questions about the level of diversity on campus.
“A lot of clubs were already having these dialogues,” Antony Lopez (COL ’14), a participant in the initiative, said. “We had all had these conversations at the same time and just decided to come together and do something about this.”
The initiative aims to establish a network of students and alumni who are interested in discussing diversity and create a fund through the Office of Advancement that would allow alumni to donate money to programs that promote and celebrate minority groups on campus.
The group’s three main goals include creating a cultural and ethnic studies center, bolstering academic offerings in minority and ethnic studies topics and increasing support for scholarships, events and mentorship for minority students.
“We’re reaching out to [alumni],” Carly Rosenfield (COL ’14), another participant, said. “We’re saying, ‘We understand the way you feel. We’re trying to change that and we need your help.’”
Rosenfield added that Georgetown needs to provide more opportunities for students who are interested in ethnic studies.
“A student could go through Georgetown never taking a class [that is] not based on either the United States or Europe,” Rosenfield said. “Georgetown is very much behind its peer institution[s] in terms of the breadth of its academics.”
Unlike many of its peer institutions, including Boston College and the University of Chicago, Georgetown has neither a general education requirement for a diversity-based class nor an ethnic-based department of studies.
While the university offers an African American studies program, there is a difference between a department and a study program. A fully-developed program can offer tenure to professors, while in a study program, professors must attain tenure in a different department or remain adjunct.
The group raised awareness about their efforts at the Students of Color Alliance Unity Dinner, a gathering held on Nov. 5 that brought together students, faculty and administrators to discuss topics ranging from the role of racial and ethnic groups to ways to increase collaboration between SOCA and other organizations on campus.
The dinner allowed the members of Cura Personalis to get feedback on their proposals and garner support for their efforts.
“I was really excited by their presentation,” said James Saucedo (MSB ’13), a student who attended the dinner. “I saw the initiative as taking the [Student Commission for Unity’s] recommendations and bringing them back to campus.”
“The time is right for a lot of changes to occur,” Lopez said. “There are a lot of things that Georgetown does well. Our goal is getting them to work together, centralizing them [and] creating oversight.”
Initiative members are optimistic that Provost Robert Groves will be responsive to their efforts, citing his recent blog post about diversity.
“The fact that he’s listening — that’s a good first step,” Fernandez said.

Georgetown alumni James Hilson (COL ’08), Eric Rodawig (COL ’07) and Ken Martin (MSB ’07) returned to the neighborhood last month as the new owners of the local Saxbys franchise.
According to Hilson, the three friends have had their eyes on the O Street branch of the national coffee chain since graduating from Georgetown.
Hilson, a former opinion editor of The Hoya, worked in the coffee shop as a student in 2007 and 2008 and developed a relationship with former owner Jack Egle. According to Hilson, Egle contacted him when he decided he was ready to sell the franchise.
“[Egle] wanted to put it in the hands of people who he knew really cared, people he was confident in … people who care about the Georgetown community and … feel like they’re part of the Georgetown community culture,” he said.
While the team declined to comment on the price they paid to purchase the franchise, Hilson said that the trio was attracted to buying the business because of the fondness the coffee shop has shown for the Georgetown community.
“There’s a great camaraderie … between the Saxbys employees and the different customers that we serve,” Hilson said. “I think Saxbys has a great relationship with the community, and it’s nice to be part of that relationship and atmosphere.”
Rodawig, formerly a viewpoint editor of The Hoya, added that the team feels fortunate to be assuming a leadership role in one of the best-known businesses in the area.
“There aren’t a ton of businesses right in Georgetown, and the ones like [Booeymonger’s] and [The] Tombs are kind of institutions and have been part of the community for a long time. We’re excited to be part of the community [for the] long term, as there aren’t too many opportunities for that,” he said.
Rodawig said that the new owners hope to build on the success the franchise has established during its six years of operation by expanding product offerings at the location.
“We are looking to expand some of [our] products, like yogurt, smoothies and oatmeal, and we would like to add some soup, especially with the colder winter months,” he said. “We would like to make our own sandwiches in there … rather than having them delivered fresh daily from a deli.”
He added that the team will seek to maintain the “mom-and-pop” feel of the coffee shop by continuing to source products locally and adding menu boards designed by a local artist.
“Our goal is to have that local, small-business feel,” Rodawig said. “The touch of an owner who’s in the shop every day … [is] someone who can make the shop have that feel.”
Hilson said that the team is considering accepting GOCard as a form of payment, a service that was removed from the coffee shop earlier this year.

The Georgetown University Student Association website is currently offline while the organization transfers its site to a more user-friendly platform.
Previously, GUSA’s website, GUStudentAssociation.com, was published on Drupal, a content-management platform. The new site will have a georgetown.edu URL and will be supported by WordPress. According to GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13), this will enable better integration of the student government into the campus community.
“The thought was that we would have some more institutional ability with a georgetown.edu website and just have all the documents stored at one place,” she said.
Gustafson said she anticipates that the change will result in a more efficient website with more storage capability.
“We don’t really need the functionalities of what Drupal could offer versus [the] WordPress platform, so we decided to switch over, and also our storage would be here at Georgetown,” Gustafson said.
GUSA Senate Speaker Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) agreed with Gustafson.
“It will be a lot more accessible for students and easier for us to update,” Tisa said.
Currently, GUSA relies on social media and university emails to communicate with students, while the GUSA senate stores its meeting minutes at box.net, an online file sharing website. However, while the minutes are open to the public, few students are aware of the existence of that information.
Tisa said it is important to make GUSA senate records available through the official GUSA website so students can communicate openly and efficiently with their elected representatives.
“Transparency and engagement has been a huge priority this year, and the new site will take it to another level,” Tisa said.
According to Gustafson, the website transfer process has taken longer than expected because all georgetown.edu student organization websites are being re-evaluated to increase cohesiveness.
“I think it is a necessary thing to happen because the university had disconnected approaches to technology in the past, so I’m really happy that this re-evaluation … is going on,” Gustafson said. “There has been a huge push in trying to have a cohesive approach to technology and website hosting. … I think we’re also part of that process,” Gustafson said.
According to GUSA Secretary of Information and Technology Michael Crouch (MSB ’13), the next step includes an evaluation of the proposed university-affiliated GUSA website by University Information Services.
“We are not doing too much right now besides waiting on administrators,” Crouch wrote in an email. “The issue is not just about the GUSA site, it’s about defining requirements for hosting any sort of site on the main Georgetown URL.”

Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J. (COL ’88) professed his final vows to the Society of Jesus in Gaston Hall Saturday.
The profession of final vows marks the end of the formation — the formal teaching period for a Jesuit. The ceremony requires the priest to reaffirm his commitment to poverty, chastity, obedience and the Jesuit mission.
Held during the 11:30 a.m. Catholic Mass, O’Brien’s final vows reaffirmed his dedication to the Jesuit service of the Church and the world.
“For me, the vow profession is a recommitment to my life as a Jesuit,” O’Brien said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is a life I’m now living at Georgetown, and it’s a recommitment to service and ministry I offer at Georgetown.”
The profession of final vows is the sixth and final step in becoming a Jesuit, and it ended O’Brien’s 16-year journey. The other stages included a two-year period of novitiate studies, a three-year period of first-level studies, a three-year period of regency that includes educational and spiritual training, a three-year period of theology studies, five years of ministry and a period of tertianship — preparation for the final vows.
After graduating from Georgetown, O’Brien studied politics and earned a law degree from the University of Florida. He began practicing corporate law, but felt that something was missing from his career as a litigator. Seeking a higher level of fulfillment, he began work as a high school teacher and started considering a life in the priesthood.
“When I practiced law, the idea of becoming a Jesuit priest came back in a very big way. In order to discern that call, I left my law practice,” O’Brien said. “In teaching at this high school, my call to become a Jesuit priest became stronger each year.”
Throughout his years of service, O’Brien has taught at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, worked in the Office of University Mission and Ministry at Fordham University, served as an associate pastor at Holy Trinity Church in Washington D.C., volunteered in the Jesuit refugee services, hospitals and jails and lived abroad in lesser developed countries.
O’Brien was ordained as a priest in 2006 and returned to Georgetown in August 2008 to work as executive director of Campus Ministry. In August 2011, O’Brien was named vice president for mission and ministry.
“A Jesuit’s life is characterized by study, work and prayer. It is a mix of those three things,” O’Brien said. “I bring all of that to my work here now at Georgetown.”
The Mass was conducted as an open service, with Rev. James Shea, S.J., the provincial of the Maryland province of the Society of Jesus presiding over the ceremony. O’Brien delivered his vows before the sacrament of Communion.
“Whatever greatness we aspire to, it must run through the lives of those who have the least — the poor, the homeless, the neglected, the undocumented, those bearing the burdens of injustice in our world,” O’Brien said at the ceremony. “In the end, this day is not about one man’s profession of vows but a religious community’s commitment to something larger than ourselves. Final vows are a promise in an act of hope for the future.”
University President John J. DeGioia also spoke at the ceremony.
“There is a finality that we recognize. All doubts are removed, [and] there is no question regarding Kevin’s acceptance of the responsibility of total commitment,” DeGioia said. “But final does not mean that Kevin stops growing.”
Above all, the ceremony was a celebration of O’Brien’s impact in the Georgetown community.
“The example that Fr. O’Brien sets everyday as a model is commendable,” Rev. Stefanie Chappell,Harbin Hall chaplain-in-residence, said of O’Brien’s work. “He makes me want to take my commitment to faith more fully and seriously.”
Knights of Columbus member Kevin Sullivan (SFS ’14) agreed.
“This is our way to give back to Fr. O’Brien and his achievements within the community,” Sullivan said.
Not one for resting on his laurels, O’Brien said he now looks forward to continuing his service for the Church, the Georgetown community and the world.
“My work with the poor in this country and in other countries always reminds me of the heart of my calling as a Jesuit. Wherever I am, whatever I am doing, I must always keep the needs of the poor and marginalized close to me,” O’Brien said. “That’s when a Jesuits vocation is lived most authentically.”

The Georgetown University Student Association began recruiting students to serve on an advisory committee to assess the quality of religious life on campus and craft the GUSA Mission and Ministry Report.
The committee will comprise about 12 students in addition to co-chairs Kevin Sullivan (SFS ’14) and Laura West (COL ’13), representatives from the Georgetown University Office of Campus Ministry, Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. O’Brien, S.J.,  and university chaplains.
Applications for student spots on the committee were sent out Nov. 6 and are due today. Sullivan will select the student representatives by the end of the week, according to West, who also serves asGUSA secretary of mission and ministry.
Sullivan lauded the new initiative.
“This is the students’ first opportunity to have a formalized voice to have this kind of discussion,” he said. “It’s a big step in the right direction.”
According to West, the group aims to gather data to gauge the role of  campus ministry and religion and offer suggestions to improve ministry on campus. Sullivan said the committee hopes to release its report by the end of the 2013-2014 academic year.
“We want to make sure we focus on all aspects of campus ministry — so in the classrooms, extra-curricular and co-curricular,” West said. “We want to be intentional and not too broad in our scope and recognize that campus ministry plays a role in a lot of aspects on campus.”
The committee and the Office of Campus Ministry will release a campus-wide survey early next semester to measure student opinion about religious life on campus. The group will also organize focus groups and formal discussions on religion and gather information from other Catholic schools in the District to compare experiences, according to Sullivan.
“We hope to have hard data ready by the end of the next semester and spend the end of the next calendar year working on compiling the information and writing the recommendations,” West said.
The idea for the working group arose from the Student Life Report, a 10-year plan released in February 2012 that outlined ways to improve the quality of the on-campus experience. It was also inspired by the Task Force on Georgetown’s Catholic and Jesuit Identity, a faculty commission report released in 1997 that explored ways that Georgetown could enhance its Jesuit identity.
“The Student Life Report stated that the spiritual life merits its own study separate from the student life report,” Sullivan said. “The Student Life Report called on others who would be more qualified to perform the report.”
After gathering data, the group will present its insights to the Office of Campus Ministry, university faculty, administrators and students.
“We wanted to present a report that takes some of the insight that has come from student discussions … so we can get a better understanding of how religion manifests itself on campus and where our weakness[es] and strengths are,” West said. “The goal is to provide the university with a set of both commendation and recommendations about how religious and spiritual life can continue to flourish on campus.”

U2 frontman and social activist Bono spoke about the fight against global poverty and AIDS in Gaston Hall Monday evening.
The event was co-sponsored by Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan and the Global Social Enterprise Initiative at the McDonough School of Business.
Bono criticized the prevalence of attack ads in the presidential campaign, joking about a scenario in which universities ran attack ads.
“Hello, we’re Georgetown and we approve this message. … Syracuse: a school whose mascot is a fruit,” he said in a mocking, baritone voice.
More seriously, he called for Americans to focus their energy on global health issues rather than partisan politics.
“I’d like to hear an attack ad on malaria,” he said.
Bono went on to speak about the effects budget cuts have on populations that depend on foreign aid for famine and AIDS relief.
“Cuts shouldn’t cost lives,” he said. “We must not let the economic recession become a moral recession.”
He discussed the efforts that are necessary to make a difference, challenging the idea that social change can be affected through a one-dollar donation at the grocery store.
“If you want to turn the world right-side up, it’s not going to take a minute or an hour or a day. It’s going to take your whole life,” he said.
Bono emphasized the importance of fostering independent economic growth and investment in developing countries and the pitfalls of reliance on foreign aid, comparing growth in China to growth in Africa.
“We used to talk about Asian tigers … but this is not an African tiger. This is a lion,” he said, predicting that Africa’s future economic development would mirror China’s recent rise to prominence.
Bono closed his speech with an appeal to the American ideals of equality and the pursuit of happiness, saying that support for global health and development initiatives is an extension of these values.
“These aren’t just American ideals anymore. … These truths, your truths, they’re self-evident in us,” he said.
Students said they appreciated Bono’s advocacy efforts in addition to his stage presence.
“It was very inspiring. Obviously he’s very passionate about what he does and really believes that all of us can make a change,” Nadeen Hussain (NHS ’15) said. “He encouraged us to think outside the box and make change.”
“He was very personable. He was both a rock star and innovative,” Lee Stromberg (MSB ’13) said. “He had the charisma of a rock star but the ability to connect with people very easily.

Many students voting in the District of Columbia and northern Virginia last Tuesday encountered long lines and delays at polling places, which in Georgetown were partly because of a surge in student voter turnout.
Arianne Kaldewey (SFS ’15) and Kelly Pierce (MSB ’15) both spent almost three hours at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, the polling place for Georgetown University and the surrounding area.
“People were definitely frustrated because there was not only general disorganization but also a lack of communication regarding the hold-up,” Pierce said. “As a student with a schedule, I know that the unforeseen time commitment was … frustrating for many.”
For some students, the delays ultimately prevented them from voting at all.
Natasha Khan (COL ’16) said she did not end up voting as a result of the wait times at the polling center. Khan had wanted to register at Duke Ellington but decided against it after seeing the line at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday.
“I only spent five minutes in line at Duke Ellington,” she said. “Because I realized from the length of the line that it would probably take another few hours before I could vote and I didn’t want to take that long … I decided to leave.”
According to Agnes Moss, the public information officer for the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics, the problems at polling centers in the District were likely a result of high voter turnout.
Although the board is still in the process of collecting and analyzing Tuesday’s data, Moss said that a rise in the number of absentee ballots from 2010 to 2012 could indicate that voter turnout in the District was higher than it was two years ago, when early voting was first introduced.
“There were 22,000 people who cast their ballots during the early voting period for the mid-term elections [in 2010]. This year, there were over 58,000. That shows you the trend of what [overall turnout] could be once we’re finished counting the ballots,” Moss said.
Moss was adamant that a lack of voting machines or unpreparedness on the part of poll workers did not cause Tuesday’s widespread delays.
“We came to the conclusion that that number of machines would be sufficient based our historical data from 2008,” Moss said.
Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14), who was elected the commissioner for single-member district 2E 08 of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Tuesday, said that he believes high turnout by same-day-registration voters accounted for delays but stressed that the Board of Elections and Ethics should have been better prepared.
“There were two factors,” he said. “One, the precinct seemed a little unorganized. … The other issue, specifically for Georgetown students, was there was abnormally high turnout, specifically in my single-member district, so the Board of Elections [and Ethics] ran out of ballots for that district twice.”
Craig Cassey (COL ’15), who was elected commissioner for SMD 2E 04, said that students had to wait while ballots were reprinted, which contributed to delays.
Moss attributed the disarray that Pierce and other Georgetown students witnessed at polling places like Duke Ellington to the fact that there were a few poll workers who did not show up for duty.
Moss added that, according to policy, everyone in the District who was in line by 8 p.m. was allowed to vote.
“Precinct captains were instructed, and they knew very well that anyone who made it to the line by then could cast their ballot,” Moss said.
According to Moss, there are a number of other factors besides high turnout that the Board of Elections and Ethics will take into account when analyzing Tuesday’s data, including the inefficiencies that specialized ANC ballots may have caused.
“There were over 661 ballots in the city due to ANC races,” Moss said. “What that means is that when you go up to the check-in clerk, you have to give him or her your ANC district, and there were over 90 ANC races throughout D.C. You had to get a special ballot for each and every one of those, so that probably came into play.”
Nonetheless, Georgetown students urged that the District take into account the growing volume of students who want to participate in local elections.
“I think there was a miscalculation of how many Georgetown students were not able to fill out absentee ballots for their home state and would want to register to vote in D.C.,” Kaldewey said.
Cassey said that while students should be encouraged to register before the delay of the election to minimize wait times, he emphasized that it is still important to cater to same-day voters.
“There will always be a population we should empower with the chance to vote … through same-day registration,” he said.
Prindiville added that he has already raised concerns about issues regarding same-day registrants with the ANC and plans to launch a discussion with the Board of Elections and Ethics soon.
According to Moss, the board has just begun the process of evaluating Tuesday’s data and identifying the issues that caused the delays.
“We’re now reviewing what were all the factors that came into play and how we can take them into consideration moving forward,” she said. “All decisions [and] all preparations are based on historical data. Everything has to be justified by data so we can use our resources in the best way possible.”

Georgetown graduate and Ignatian Programs Coordinator Colleen Kerrisk (COL ’10) shared her experience working with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps at an informal dinner with a group of 20 seniors and juniors Friday night.
The dinner, which was held in the home of Director of Professional and Residential Ministry Michelle Siemietkowski, aimed to raise students’ awareness of the JVC and to encourage students to consider the program when making postgraduate plans.
Founded in 1956, JVC pairs volunteers with some of America’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods. Volunteers spend one year serving in positions that focus on education and immigration.
When Kerrisk began her talk, she asked the students why they were interested in the JVC. Reasons varied from confirming whether or not to become a Jesuit to having an interest in community organizing after graduation.
“For me, I knew from the get-go that I wanted to do JVC,” Kerrisk said.
She credited her Georgetown education as the motivating factor behind her decision to apply to JVC.
“I learned about how broken and unjust our world is in the classes I took at Georgetown,” she said. “I wanted to learn about these people — their names and faces, not just statistics.”
Like every interested applicant, Kerrisk underwent an online application process, followed by an interview with a JVC staff member and a reflection process to prove her personal commitment to the program.
After her acceptance, Kerrisk was assigned to Proyecto Pastoral, an after-school educational program for children in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. The program was organized by the Dolores Mission Church, a small Jesuit parish known for its active pursuit of community-wide social justice.
Kerrisk said the Dolores Mission Church enlivened her spiritual life.
“There was no separation of faith and life there. They were so intertwined,” she said. “I saw them embrace homeless men as sons, brothers and fathers.”
This communal spirituality encouraged Kerrisk to complete a second year with JVC. She moved to D.C. and began her work at an inner-city tutoring program.
Kerrisk shared the story of an undocumented immigrant from the Dominican Republic whom Kerrisk helped get accepted into her dream university and acquire enough scholarship and financial aid funds to afford her education.
“You all will have different experiences, but the ones I’ve had, they’ve helped to shape and form me,” she said. “I will always carry these people, these experiences and JVC with me.”
Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13), a student who attended the meeting, said she attended the dinner to meet the off-campus chaplain-in-residence and learn more about post-graduation options.
“I’m looking into a lot of options and it gave me a better understanding what the JVC is as a volunteer option,” she said. “I haven’t applied to many things after graduation but when I do, I definitely will look back and draw upon her experiences.”
