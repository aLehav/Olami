Aramark workers on campus are engaged in efforts to renegotiate their contract with the company, demanding better work and wage conditions, since their current three-year contract expires in March.
A group of 20 Aramark workers from O’Donovan Hall, Cosi and Starbucks and a group of 30 students from the Georgetown Solidarity Committee marched together to Aramark leadership at Leo’s Friday to present their demands. In addition, “Equality at Georgetown,” an online petition created two weeks ago by the Georgetown Solidarity Committee in support of the workers’ demands, has already amassed over 900 student and community member signatures.
Georgetown Aramark workers from Leo’s, Cosi and Starbucks unionized in March 2011 under UNITE HERE, a company that provides guidance to over 90,000 food service employees around the world. The company runs an office on K Street in Washington, D.C., as well as other offices around the country.
The workers have utilized the union in the past to renegotiate contracts, specifically in March 2012, when they negotiated a three-year contract with Aramark that provided workers with a 50-cent-per-hour wage increase and coverage of 85 percent of their health care costs by the third year. This contract expires this March, and the employees are now involved in contract renegotiations with Aramark leadership.
The workers’ demands include a 40-hour paid workweek, better benefits and raises, protection for immigrant workers and sustainable food practices for on-campus food.
Georgetown Aramark employee and union representative Rhonda Smith said that the workers are fighting for rightful treatment and respect.
“I want every worker to have a 40-hour pay week — paid hours,” Smith said. “I want every worker to have his or her pay raised. I want every worker to have dignity and respect. I want every worker to have their job protected by the union. I want better health plans, loyal health plans.”
Currently, Aramark workers do not receive the benefits that come along with a 40-hour work week such as health insurance and raises even if they are working up to 37 hours a week. In addition, workers are not provided with sustainable food to serve in the dining hall for students and receive minimal protection for immigrant workers.
Unionized Aramark workers at other universities in the area including American University and The Catholic University of America have already successfully negotiated contracts to achieve these goals.
Smith said that UNITE HERE has provided employees with advice and encouragement during the contract renegotiation.
“They [the union] have been helping a lot,” Smith said. “They are in touch with us every day. They help us talk to people, get our petitions signed, educate people, and what not. They help [teach] us how to talk to people, what to do. We just came from a meeting — they help us learn how to talk to the managers when they are doing something wrong. They’ve been really good.”
Aramark’s Director of Corporate Communications Karen Cutler said that Aramark will work to bargain with the union in the coming months.
“Aramark has hundreds of collective bargaining agreements around the country with the various unions who represent our employees,” Cutler wrote in an email. “Negotiating union collective bargaining agreements are a routine part of business. At Georgetown, we are committed to bargaining in good faith and are working hard with union representatives to come to an agreement that works for everyone. We had a productive meeting this week and hope to have a new agreement soon.”
Aramark manages over 260,000 employees worldwide with a revenue of $13.51 billion dollars as of 2012. The company has been criticized in the past for various claims of mistreatment and uncleanliness. For example, in 2012, an Aramark regional manager sent an email to all employees that warned them that unionizing could lead to job termination. In addition, in February 2012, the Health Department found that 14 Aramark-run cafeterias in New Orleans received critical violations, four of which were for rat feces.
The petition is still active, and GSC President Clara Mejia (COL ’17) said that they hope to reach 2,000 signatures by March. They will deliver the petition to Aramark management the second week of February after negotiations continue to develop to encourage more compromise between Aramark and the worker’s union. They will continue to request signatures from students by presenting their goals to classes with the help of Aramark workers and advertising the petition on social media.
“These workers are an integral and valued part of our community and we need to stand in solidarity and fight with them,” Mejia said. “Given its history and mission of standing in solidarity with the workers and advocating for them, GSC started the petition to bring awareness at the lack of a fair and just contract in Leo’s and to reaffirm student solidarity with campus workers.”
GSC helped workers unionize in 2011 and has remained an active partner with them since then. They provide a hotline for workers to call about work-related grievances, meet one-on-one with employees, and host events and appreciation meals for all workers on campus. Mejia said that students at Georgetown must advocate for the employees around them.
“As students, it is our responsibility to advocate for the needs of workers because they too form part of our Georgetown community,” Mejia said. “In addition, student presence and support will pressure Aramark into giving the workers a more fair contract they deserve.”
Aramark worker Rhonda Smith said that student help in this campaign has been invaluable.
“It’s awesome,” Smith said. “They care. They back us 100 percent. When we went to go serve them the petitions they were right there by our side. Last time we heard we had 900 signatures from Georgetown students. They are concerned. The community and the university, the Jesuit community, they all support us.”

Local Mexican restaurant Los Cuates and convenience store Wisemiller’s Grocery & Deli were raided in the past two weeks by the Metropolitan Police Department in attempt to locate use of fake identifications among customers, as well as the sales of alcoholic beverages to the underaged.
On Saturday, around 20 underage students were caught with fake identifications by undercover police officers in Los Cuates. Manager Sergio Kehl said that no prior warning was given to the management, as three police officers entered and began to question customers in the restaurant. Although the identifications were confiscated, no students were arrested.
The officers said to the students involved at the restaurant that their names would be referred to the university, where further discipline would be carried out. The disciplinary measures to be carried out by the the university are still unknown. The Office of Student Conduct could not be reached for comment.
Student Advocacy Office Co-Director Ben Manzione (SFS ’15) said he could not comment on specific cases, but he described the usual disciplinary process when police refer cases to the university.
“The student goes through the legal system and then the student could also face disciplinary sanctions from the university. The way that works is the Metropolitan Police Department, when the student is arrested, sometimes what they’ll do is they’ll call the university and they’ll let the university know right away. Other times what they’ll do is they’ll forward the reports to the university,” Manzione said. “They will refer reports involving students who may have committed crimes to the GUPD and then the GUPD will forward them to the Office of Student Conduct and then they’ll get adjudicated from there.”
Manzione added that, of the cases on which SAO works, usage of fake IDs was among the most common referrals from the MPD, in addition to noise violations.
“We do see a fair amount of cases come involving the use of fake IDs,” Manzione said.
In addition to sanctions for students, the Alcohol Beverage Regulation Administration, which regulates licenses for restaurants to sell alcohol in the District, investigates incidents of underage sales to determine whether to suspend or revoke alcohol licenses.
ABRA Public Affairs Specialist Jessie Cornelius would not comment about the specific incidents in the past two weeks, but she explained the organization’s general policy on license suspensions.
“Essentially the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board can suspend or revoke an alcoholic beverage license if the licensee violates District laws and regulations including but not limited to District of Columbia Official Code Title 25 and Municipal Regulations Title 23, violates the terms of the license or settlement agreement, presents an imminent danger to the health and safety of the public, or fails to pay licensing fees and fines,” Cornelius wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The District of Columbia Official Code Title 25 and Municipal Regulations Title 23 states that the board may issue fines and suspend or revoke licenses if the licensee allows the establishment to be used for any unlawful purpose.
Furthermore, the MPD chief of police may request the suspension or revocation of a license if there seems to be a correlation between increased crime within 1,000 feet of the establishment and the operation of the establishment. If an establishment loses its permit, it is ineligible to regain its license for five years.
Recently, Foggy Bottom bar McFadden’s Restaurant and Saloon closed after it lost its license when five people were stabbed at the establishment Dec. 30.
Licenses are subject to revocation only after a hearing involving the defendant. Kehl said that authorities had not yet reached out to Los Cuates after the Saturday night raid. The restaurant turned away several college-aged patrons Sunday after they attempted to use fake identifications, prompting rude remarks from the customers.
Fake identifications have also been seized at Wisemiller’s over the past two weekends, but the Metropolitan Police Department and Wisemiller’s staff declined to comment on the incidents involving fake identifications and sales to underage drinkers.

This is an example of upper class privilege. Students at most public universities would be in the clink and charged with minor in possession, which in some states can permanently preclude receiving certain professional licenses.

Students at most public universities can get into bars and drink without worry of getting busted by undercover cops.

After the D.C. General Hospital in southeast Washington was converted into a homeless shelter in 2001, Georgetown University Medical Center students revived the building’s medical tradition by creating the first student-run clinic in D.C. in 2006.
The HOYA Clinic, established in the hospital’s east wing in 2006, serves a population desperately in need while simultaneously providing medical students with real-world experience. Nearly nine years after its founding, the clinic now serves as a model for a similar center set to open next month on the island of Antigua.
Boasting over 400 medical student volunteers, the HOYA Clinic uniquely depends entirely on medical students for its operation on the administrative side as well as in the exam rooms with patients. Having raised funds through GUMC aid, events, private donations and a grant from the Association of American Medical Colleges, all of the clinic’s services are free of charge, and they see patients of all age, regardless of insurance or immigration status. In addition to health assessments, the clinic offers wellness workshops on topics from nutrition to meditation to Zumba.
Caitlin Ingraham, a second-year medical student, serves as one of seven student coordinators. She works alongside other student volunteers, nurse practitioners and M.D. physicians to evaluate acute and chronic illnesses, administer vaccines for the human papillomavirus and sexually transmitted infections, provide general wellness physical exams and instruct patients in basic health education.
“For a lot of Georgetown medical students, it’s their first time being part of a medical team and being part of a clinical team that gets to see patients and learn about patients’ lives and then help patients to make medical decisions,” Ingraham said.
With its location in the city’s southeast quadrant, together with its proximity to the D.C. General homeless shelter, the clinic allows students to engage in social justice work while extending their education.
“I am incredibly interested and committed to social justice work and addressing health disparities and social and economic inequalities, and I think that being part of the HOYA Clinic is a way to engage in that and to start to use the skills I have and all of the infrastructure that is here at Georgetown to try to chip away at some of those issues,” Ingraham said.
Larick David, a first-year medical student volunteer, echoed Ingraham, pointing to the clinic’s toy drive over Christmas for children staying at D.C. General as an example of the center’s commitment to the community.
“The work that the students have been doing at HOYA Clinic has opened avenues for us to reach that community in other ways,” David said. “It’s not always health oriented, it’s ways to improve their lives in general and it goes back to the idea of cura personalis I’ve seen here at Georgetown.”
Antigua’s University of Health Sciences Chairman Deborah Robinson-Akande noticed the clinic’s work.
She approached GUMC Assistant Dean of Diversity and Inclusion Benjamin Walker in September 2013 with a proposal for students at the two schools to collaborate.
As the two talked, Walker realized that Antigua’s population was similar to the community to which the HOYA Clinic administers: composed of medically underserved individuals with big health problems ranging from diabetes to basic health education. The idea to build a clinic in Antigua modeled after the HOYA Clinic immediately sprang up; the clinic in that area of Antigua had closed a few years previously, leaving residents without easily accessible health services.
“[The] Jesuit identity Georgetown has is not just something on the website or a slogan or hanging from banners, it’s something that is really organic and palpable,” Walker said. “This is an example of that.”
The board of directors, composed of GUMC directors as well as faculty members from the University of Health Sciences in Antigua, described their vision of the Free Clinic at English Harbor becoming “a jewel in the ring of health clinics.”
They also believe it will advance the way medicine is practiced on the island, and they have hopes for an island-wide network of medical records.
“The health minister is really excited about it because we can collect data on incidence rates of [diseases],” Walker said. “That has never been done before.”
The collaboration could open further opportunities for students at the medical center.
“One of the big plans for us here at Georgetown is that when it’s up and running and the quality of the educational experience of the students is evaluated by our dean for international programs, then it would be great to have this as another international program offering,” Walker said.
Walker explained that the goals of both the Free Clinic at English Harbor and the HOYA Clinic were to integrate students into the fabric of the community to help the residents while seizing the opportunity to educate students in an interactive environment.
“That’s a strength of the medical education at Georgetown: we introduce you to the patient early and we teach you how to learn from the patient. That is extremely important,” Walker said. “You can be number one in your class all through undergrad. But there is always something you can learn from your patients. Because no matter how long you’ve been practicing medicine those patients have been in their bodies longer.”
Although it now serves as a model for the Antigua clinic, the HOYA Clinic is still continuing to develop its services, hoping to add dental treatments and mental health services to its repertoire. The clinic will also host two health insurance enrollment days for patients in the community this month.
“Those are big infrastructure things that go beyond what Georgetown medical students can provide but we are always seeking out new partnerships and new ways to build the services and the support structure we can provide for our patients,” Ingraham said.

Students living in university-owned townhouses will have to walk their trash to one of four collection sites within a block of their homes once city-provided curbside trash pickup ceases Feb. 3.
The change in university trash policy was announced in an email Tuesday to on-campus townhouse residents and arises as a result of current methods of trash disposal that have led to sanitation and rodent issues.
“The technical reasons for the change are apparent if one walks our community streets,” Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya. “There is improper storage and flow of trash which consist of open trash cans which are not properly sealed, trash cans in public space on days other than collection days, too many trash cans, trash bags on the curb and other debris improperly stowed on the sidewalks.”
The mishandled trash not only is an eyesore to the community but has led to rodent problems, according to Morey. The new waste disposal plan includes daily trash pickup, new rodent control efforts for the area surrounding the dumpsters and regular cleaning procedures.
Townhouses on the 3600 block of Prospect Street have been using a central trash collection system on their block for years, according to the email sent to students this week. The new policy will help to standardize collection methods across residence halls.
Planning and Facilities Management employees from the university will collect the old plastic roller trash bins and distribute trash bags to townhouse residences once curbside service ceases next week.
Morey said that although students did not request the change in policy, they were included in the decision-making process through the Georgetown Community Partnership Steering Committee as well as the Environmental and Landlords Working Group.
Students have expressed concern, however, that the new trash disposal system will be an unwelcome burden, especially during inclement weather, leading to longer walks to collection sites.
“I think it’s a policy that’s not necessarily advantageous to students,” townhouse resident Ben Forester (MSB ’16) said. “We signed a contract at the beginning of the year to get our trash taken out. Now what they’re calling improvement is they’re pretty much making us take our trash out to a farther location every day. We have to walk two blocks every day with all our trash bags.”
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said that though the longer distance is a hindrance, the old method of collection presented an annoyance of a different type.
“I understand that carrying trash to containers can be a chore,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I know that managing trash cans is also a chore. We believe this change will not add a burden. We appreciate students’ flexibility in adapting to this new approach.”
Townhouse resident Nina Eng (NHS ’16) shared a different point of view than Olson.
“While the university feels it will aid students, they neglect to realize that the extra effort of moving the trash can through the house or to the backyard is negligible in comparison to the new required process of walking trash to the new further trash locations,” Eng said.
Staff Writer Katherine Richardson contributed reporting to this story.

Past Townhouse Resident says

Please, this is hardly an extra effort. Trash pickup was already dismal at best, carrying a few bags out a week on your way to class is not even a chore in and of itself.

More than 700 students have signed a student-created petition on Facebook calling to repeal the university’s new housing policy that denies housing lottery access to students studying abroad in fall. The policy was issued on Feb. 6, 2014.
The petition, titled “Student Against Restrictive Housing Policy (2015),” was created Jan. 25 as an event page by Declan Kelly (COL ’17) and Will Simons (COL ’16).
“It’s the freshmen and the sophomores that are at stake here, so naturally, we thought a sophomore should lead the charge and that’s what I’m doing,” Kelly said.
According to Georgetown’s Selection Handbook, a student who confirms their fall study-abroad plans with the Office of Residential Living will forfeit their eligibility to go through the housing selection process during the fall semester.
Fall study-abroad students will be assigned to a random roommate or fill in for a student studying abroad in the spring through a direct swap when they return to campus. Students studying abroad in fall 2015 will be notified while they are abroad about applying for spring semester housing. There is no guarantee that students will receive specific housing on campus.
Study-abroad applications for the fall semester are due in February while applications for the spring are due in October. Approximately 57 percent of Georgetown students study abroad, which totals to about 900 students a year.
“Students who study abroad [are] making a decision to not have a ‘typical’ junior year on campus. … However, by deciding to study abroad, there are payoffs. One of those is not having the exact housing experience one might have had if they did not go abroad,” Executive Director of Residential Services Patrick Killilee said.
According to Killilee, dissuading students from studying abroad in the fall was not a consideration when changing the selection timeline.
“Students are asked to provide their top five choices for housing,” Killilee said. “They can request roommates and to fill an anticipated vacancy. Our priority is to assign to the requested vacancy if possible, house students in roommate pairs and then by requested building. We know it is often more important to students to live with someone they know over where the actual room is located.”
This policy change was previously scheduled to go into effect during the fall 2014 semester, but was rescheduled to start during the fall 2015 semester after students voiced concern about the rule through a similar Facebook petition. The petition garnered over 500 signatures and encouraged the housing office to delay the implementation of this policy.
In addition, students in the class of 2016 will receive priority in selecting housing for next year after a university policy shift in February gave priority to rising seniors over rising juniors.
“They just tried to dump it on the next class and that is something that everyone that’s in the Class of 2017 and any class after that has a perfectly legitimate beef with,” Kelly said. “We’re students of this university, we pay — some would consider — a whopping amount, to go here. If that doesn’t afford you the right to a voice when it comes to where you live and with whom you live, then I’m not sure what we’re doing here.”
Last year, Simons worked with Killilee to voice concerns about the changed policy. As a result the policy was pushed back one year, and Simons was able to study abroad in Buenos Aires and return this spring to live in a Nevils apartment with friends.
“[Study abroad is] something so unique and Georgetown pushes it so heavily,” Simons said. “If you look at it from marketing materials they really like to push that over 50 percent of students study abroad, we have all these programs, we have these two great villas. … [The policy change] just seems to go contradictory to them trying to focus on study abroad.”
Simons and Kelly plan to post an IdeaScale petition online this week to help demonstrate student support. They hope to get a strong backing from the freshmen and sophomore classes before planning to meet with housing administrators a couple of weeks into February.
Killilee said he was unaware of the petition that went online Sunday and that no changes will be made to the implementation of the new housing rules.
“We made the announcement that this change would go into effect for the 2015-2016 selection process last February. We will not be changing the procedure or delaying its implementation,” Killilee said.
However, Simons and Kelly said they plan to have the policy fixed by March 17, the study abroad decision deadline. Kelly said it is possible that administration will change the policy.
“It depends on how loud Georgetown can shout,” Kelly said.
Timothy Paul Shaker (COL ’17) said that this policy makes studying abroad far less attractive.
“I actually have considered not studying abroad because of the new restrictions. But honestly it just seems like such a wasted opportunity especially with how great Georgetown’s study abroad program is,” Shaker said.
Addie Lancianese (SFS ’17) said that the new policy dissuaded her from studying abroad in the fall.
“My roommate and I both wanted to go abroad this coming fall. But we’re not willing to risk an amazing semester for a possibly miserable one,” Lancianese wrote in a post on the petition’s Facebook event. “I’ve seen and heard too many horror stories to be placed in a random placement with someone I might not get along with. I shouldn’t be punished for expanding my horizons by going abroad.”

confused says 
January 30, 2015 at 9:57 am
I actually don’t see the difference between this “new” policy and the policy that’s currently in place. Can somebody please enlighten me?

The School of Foreign Service Academic Council will continue its discussion on the merits of the certificate program and the possible introduction of minors into the SFS curriculum following a town hall discussion between students, SFS Associate Dean Mitch Kaneda and SFS Interim Dean James Reardon-Anderson last Tuesday.
SFSAC President Megan Murday (SFS ’15) said that the academic council prioritized student input in their evaluation of the differences between a certificate and a minor program.
“We wanted to evaluate the certificate program and see if it would be relevant to bring in minors instead,” Murday said. “The discussion unfolded regarding evaluating the current certificates — how they function for students, what roles they play in an undergraduate education — and if there’s room for minors. Before we’re going to take a vote, the academic council has to gather student input and have a formalized response on what students prefer and what would be in their best interest.”
In a survey sent out from the academic council to SFS students two weeks ago, the majority of students indicated an interest in introducing minors into the curriculum. Thus far, 423 students have responded.
“So far, it looks about 65 percent has favored minors to certificates from what we’ve seen so far at the survey,” Murday said.
According to Murday, the discussion originated this summer after the SFSAC learned of student concern about the difference between minors and certificates as credentials.
“The SFS is really unique, and that’s definitely a strength in looking for a job. But if we were to talk about the ethos of the school and explain what your major is, especially … one that less people have heard of like [Science, Technology and International Affairs], it’s hard to add an explanation on what a certificate is and what that means in terms of complementing your education,” Murday said. “It doesn’t have the natural ‘Oh, that means six organized courses that students had to take.’”
Murday said that students who attended the town hall meeting were also attracted to the possibility of earning a minor outside of the SFS, something students of the other three schools are able to pursue. For example, students in the College can receive a minor in Science, Technology and International Affairs from the SFS.
In addition, some certificates in the SFS can be achieved as minors in other schools. For example, SFS students can only receive a certificate in subjects such as women’s and gender studies, classical studies and Latin American studies, while students in the College can receive a minor in all of these subjects with the same number of credit classes.
“Minors would also allow more access to programs in other schools,” Murday said. “I think it’s important to know that … [we’re] also making sure that the classes that students have outside of the core multidisciplinary education also provides them with a knowledge base and skill set to have outside of Georgetown and beyond.”
SFSAC Vice President Anna Hernick (SFS ’16) added that students have expressed interest in earning minors in programs from other schools.
“It’s always been an issue that students have been about — not just earning a minor versus a certificate, but having access to programs across schools,” Hernick said. “What students are most worried about is having access to programs in other schools, and also having recognition for coursework that is completed like computer science or maybe a foreign language.”
Kaneda acknowledged that while it may be in the interest of students to earn minors from other schools, minors pose practical problems.
“We have heard from many students that College minors should be made available to SFS students, but at the same time, we need to be conscious about resources and costs,” Kaneda said.
In the SFS, certain classes can provide credit for both a major and a certificate in a process called double-counting. Kaneda noted minors would require students to take more courses because students would not be able to continue using courses from their major requirements to fulfill minor requirements through double-counting.
“Minors … would allow double-counting of courses with majors, possibly being more meaningful as a qualification than certificates, [which] would allow double-counting to some extent,” Kaneda said. “Without double-counting, minors would allow students to learn from more courses, but on the other hand, minors could be less accessible to students who do not come in with [Advanced Placement] and other credits.”
Kaneda said that the decision to introduce minors should be made considering the difference between the academic experiences of the certificate and minor programs.
“[The] focus should be on the learning achieved in the certificates rather than how much a certificate or minor means as resume qualification,” Kaneda said. “SFS centers and programs that provide the certificates can bring academic communities and thesis writing experiences to the students to deepen the SFS experience.”
According to Kaneda, a certificate program allows for a more comprehensive academic experience for students that a minor program would be unable to offer.
“[Since] minors by definition are combinations of courses, we cannot require departments to include thesis research or provide other co-curricular and extra-curricular experiences to the students pursuing minors,” Kaneda said. “SFS consists of multiple centers and programs that can provide such experiences to the students, and certificates can be designed to add to the overall learning experience of students beyond the majors and other SFS requirements.”
Emily Portuguese (SFS ’18) said she hopes that this initiative will eventually lead to an SFS minor program that encompasses a broader variety of topics.
“I wish students in the SFS were able to get minors in subjects unrelated to foreign service because a lot of us have interests in other areas like psychology, math or music,” Portuguese said. “Also, I think we should be able to have a minor in a language after we take so many language classes and have to pass a proficiency exam.”
Kelly Tierney (SFS ’18) said, conversely, that certificates are a more efficient and better way of gaining credibility in the SFS.
“It doesn’t particularly bother me because some certificates have overlap with major-required courses and can take fewer classes to fulfill,” Tierney said. “However, minors may allow for more options and variety.”
Timothy Yin (SFS ’17) agreed, and said that the certificate system allows students to further specialize within the SFS in a way that minors cannot.
“I guess I like the fact that the certificates are very well integrated into the SFS curriculum,” Yin said. “To me they seem to represent a deepened course of study in a particular field of international affairs.”
Yin said that despite this, he hopes the SFS will begin to recognize that students may have a desire to pursue other academic interests.
“It is important to realize that a lot of SFS students have interests outside of international affairs and I have friends who want to pursue minors in topics like math and journalism that they aren’t able to do so in the SFS,” Yin said. “I would not replace certificates with minors, but do think that the SFS should offer the flexibility to students to choose minors or certificates.

Graduating students entering the job market have a significantly higher impression of their readiness for employment than their employers, according to a report released last week by the Association of American Colleges and Universities.
While the result reflects the growing demand for skill requirements in a sluggish post-recession job market, Georgetown officials expected a slowly recovering economy and Georgetown’s emphasis on work-based experience to help mitigate these differences.
The report compared the responses of 400 executives at private-sector companies and non-profit organizations to 613 graduating college students, approximately three-fourths of whom attended a four-year private or public institution.
The survey conducted by Hart Research Associates revealed that employers’ evaluations of skills such as communication and critical thinking were less favorable than the students’ self-evaluations. For example, while 66 percent of the surveyed college students rated their critical thinking skills between an eight and a 10 on a 0-10 scale, only 26 percent of employers rated students in a similar range.
Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce Director Anthony Carnevale explained that in 1983, the American economy began changing due to improving technology that prioritized machines in manual labor, which favored service jobs in sectors such as finance, healthcare and the information industry, demanding high entry-level requirements. With schools unable to adjust quickly to the changing market, a perception that college graduates were insufficiently prepared for the job market evolved.
“There was a very rapid increase in skill requirement, and we were suddenly dependent on our two-year and four-year college system and the for-profit schools and technical schools to get the job done,” Carnevale said. “They couldn’t keep up. The change was so fast that they didn’t keep up through the ’80s and ’90s. Most employers will tell you still that they’re not keeping up now.”
He added that while universities effectively teach the knowledge required to obtain a bachelor’s degree, students ineffectively use this knowledge in the workforce.
“Someone who takes economics or gets an economics degree at a university understands what’s in the textbook,” Carnevale said. “But they’re not good at applying that knowledge, thinking critically or doing a variety of other things which is now demanded at entry-level. A long time ago, just getting the degree was enough, but it’s not anymore.”
Carnevale said he believed this discrepancy exists because undergraduates have a fairly truncated view of the real world, as they are not truly part of it yet, but added that finding a solution may be easier said than done.
“It’s tough to get a curriculum to mimic the real world,” Carnevale said. “The real world’s more complicated.”
Cawley Career Education Center Executive Director Michael Schaub agreed with Carnevale and added that internships often fail to fully prepare students for the workforce.
“Even though many students pursue internships during college and obtain some experience in the workplace, they have yet to fully engage in work — 40 or more hours per week, week in and week out,”
Schaub wrote in an email to The Hoya. “After college graduates gain experience in the workplace and receive feedback from supervisors and peers, they will be better equipped to evaluate their competency across these learning outcomes.”
Professor of public policy Harry Holzer expressed mixed feelings about the report. While his observation that young workers are struggling in the recession did not make him dismiss the results, he believed that the surveyed employers are not a truly representative sample that fully represents the job market.
“The sample’s tilted towards bigger organizations and bigger companies,” Holzer said. “A lot of people are employed at small- and medium-sized firms that don’t have any executives.”
Holzer also said he believes hiring rates of young adults are more significant than employers’ dissatisfaction rates.
“We know that employers aren’t getting their dream employees and they’re often disappointed with a lot of the young people that they’re getting,” Holzer said. “If, in fact, they’re still willing to hire them and pay for them, that’s what we care about more.”
While the AACU report focused on the consequences for graduating college students, Holzer, whose research primarily focuses on the low-wage labor market, worried about the implications for disadvantaged workers who do not have a bachelor’s degree.
“The gap between people who have a B.A. and people who don’t have a B.A. remains as wide as ever,” Holzer said. “If employers aren’t that thrilled with people who have B.A.s, imagine what it’s like for folks who don’t have them.”
However, while not fully recovered, job prospects for the graduating class of 2015 are in better shape they were in 2008 and 2009 due to the slow rebound of the economy. Additionally, despite internships not perfectly replicating the work environment, the increased exposure of Georgetown students to pre-professional and graduate school opportunities offers them an advantage in developing specialized skills that are in demand in the job market, according to Carnevale.
“[Georgetown] does a very good job of integrating students into both work-based and service experiences, which is one of the distinctive things here,” Carnevale said. “They’re about teaching people how to work with other people outside of academic context to make their way in situations where you’re not just talking about the questions at the end of the chapter. You’re talking about the actual operations of real institutions in the real world with real people.”

Two independent equipment failures at Henle Village and Harbin Hall affected hot water systems this week, and students living in Henle remain without access to hot water during peak hours.
A water pump failure in Harbin due to a mechanical malfunction led to a reduction in hot water capacity, while a simultaneous problem with a hot water valve affected a shower cluster on the seventh floor of the building.
The pump in Harbin was replaced within two days, and the valve was repaired after just one day.
Meanwhile, in Henle, a hot water heat exchanger failed and left the system unable to meet the demand during peak usage times.
According to Vice President of Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey, the materials needed to replace the heat exchanger have been ordered, and he anticipates the system will return to normal early next week.
“We periodically experience hot water issues in residential and academic buildings, which are usually attributed to mechanical or electrical failures,” Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is fair to say the issues we experience are not alarming considering the campus is comprised of approximately 6,000,000 square feet of space.”
Aging campus infrastructure was not to blame for the two problems, according to Morey.
“Our infrastructure challenges are fairly similar to our peers in higher education and facility management in general,” Morey wrote. “Our challenge lies in being able to effectively respond to such failures and to provide quality services while repairing.”
Harbin Hall Community Director Ashley Kockler expressed a similar sentiment in an email she sent to Harbin Hall residents during the outage.
“It is never easy to keep a building this active and amazing running smoothly all the time, and sometimes unfortunate situations arise,” Kockler wrote.
Despite hot water being returned in a matter of days, the incident inconvenienced a number of residents.
Harbin resident Katelyn Shahbazian (SFS ’18) said that the outage came at a particularly bad time, when she and a number of residents were ill.
“Unfortunately, I was actually sick during the time of the outage, so I especially wanted to have a hot shower,” Shahbazian said. “I actually didn’t shower for a few days, personally. A friend and I dashed over to the guy’s cluster in our towels because they still had hot water.”
Meanwhile Henle residents were told to shower in Darnall Hall or Yates Field House until the hot water system is fully restored.
Marla Abadilla (MSB ’17), who was also sick when the hot water failed, said that the situation was frustrating.
“I understand that one of the tanks is still operating, but I’m constantly worried that the hot water will run out any second,” Abadilla said. “Having to worry about taking a warm shower creates a huge inconvenience.”

As part of the Designing the Future(s) of the University initiative, the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation launched the Futures Fellowship on Jan. 5, which will offer 23 selected undergraduate students the opportunity to participate in a consulting project with a client organization on a specific social problem.
Student applicants from all schools and grade levels were able to fill out an application detailing their interest in the program due Jan. 11 and were notified of their acceptances Jan. 13. Fellows will receive a fellow recognition note on their transcripts, but will not receive academic credit.
This spring, the Fellowship will connect its inaugural class of 23 students with the Ateneo de Manila University in the Philippines through Skype and conference calls. Students will be tasked with expanding a nutritional program for children who are unable to fully participate in school due to ongoing starvation.
Throughout the semester, the students will develop ideas and conduct research to evaluate the current program. At the end of the fellowship, they will present their recommendations to the clients and other mentors.
Beeck Center Director of Impact Investing Michael Chodos expressed his high hopes for the program, which he believes will help students to develop an ability to work across different sectors to solve complicated but important social issues.
“Through the Fellowship, students get to learn what it means to think about these really important problems on the ground level and to be able to identify where all the different pieces are,” Chodos said. “[They will learn] how to put together a comprehensive way of thinking about these problems, and to iterate as they experiment with potential solutions.”
The fellows will meet on a weekly basis times throughout the semester, in addition to attending lab sessions. The classes will be conducted in a group-mentoring format.
In addition to various professors who will mentor the students throughout the course including Chodos, guest speakers and senior students with experience in development projects will also speak to the students regularly.
In conjunction with other programs from the Designing the Future(s) of University initiative, the Fellowship aims to foster inter-disciplinary and cross-school experiential learning and opportunities.
Beeck Center Executive Director Sonal Shah said that the Futures Fellowship is also interlinked with other programs offered by the Beeck Center, including the GU Impacts program, which allows students to engage in social development work overseas, including a planned summer trip to the Philippines.
“Many of the students in the Fellowship program would have the opportunity to go and work with the organization in the Philippines during the summer,” Shah said. “This connects them from classroom to real fieldwork.”
According to Chodos, the Beeck Center plans to offer a lab focusing on social action every semester to allow students to apply their knowledge by working on a specific issue. In addition, the center is in the process of getting approval to convert the currently zero-credit course into a for-credit course next fall.
Marco Fornara (SFS ’16), who was accepted into the fellowship this semester, said that he believes the program will allow him to apply problem-solving skills to real world situations.
“I have done a lot of theoretical and intellectual work in my study of politics, and I want to see the results applied to real life situations, which is the most important aspect of problem-solving,” Fornara said.
Amanda Zeidan (MSFS ’16), another accepted student, said that the fellowship aligns well with her personal development goals.
“Understanding the way local governments, NGOs and different communities relate to this kind of project is an integral part of policy-making and is especially important for us students going into foreign service,” Zeidan said.

Photographer William Wegman donated five photographs to the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Arts & Humanities Program in an event exhibiting his work Thursday.
Wegman, a renowned artist, photographer and author whose works are held in permanent collections at the Museum of Modern Art and have appeared on “Saturday Night Live” and “Sesame Street,” spent the morning visiting pediatric oncology patients, reading from his new children’s book “Flo and Wendell Explore” and helping them make puppets of the characters. In the evening, he signed books for guests and announced the donation of the photographs, entitled “Courage,” “Endurance,” “Love,” “Strength” and “Hope,” all of which featured his signature Weimaraner dogs.
In addition to partnerships with Hope for Henry and Tracy’s Kids, nonprofit organizations that help children with cancer, Wegman’s visit was sponsored and organized by Lombardi’s Arts & Humanities Program, which aims to help patients, caregivers and family members emotionally cope with illness through art, music, visual arts and education. Lombardi Center Director Louis Weiner, who introduced Wegman, highlighted the program as essential for patients at the center.
“It’s important to remember that coming to Lombardi is not easy for our patients. It’s a stressful time in their lives, they face many challenges, and it can be a traumatic experience,” Weiner said. “It’s a high-intensity experience and having the beauty of the arts as a way of expressing ourselves and dealing with the challenges that we face as a community really makes it a little bit easier to come to work and to be seen here as a patient.”
Arts & Humanities Program Director Julia Langley, who was a Lombardi patient in 2006, echoed Weiner, saying the Arts & Humanities Program is both comforting and healing for Lombardi patients.
“We try and provide a way for them to process their emotions through music, dance, visual art, knitting, or expressive writing. If you’re dealing with an illness like cancer, it’s a chronic illness. You might get better or be in remission but you’re never considered 100 percent safe from ever having it again. You’re always dealing with it. The treatment doesn’t stop when you stop seeing your doctor,” Langley said.
Weiner also expressed his admiration for Wegman’s work as particularly in line with the mission of the Arts & Humanities Program.
“Wegman’s photos lift the spirits of everybody who comes in here. They look at these and they smile. They’re whimsical, they’re profound and the more you look at them, the more you get out of them,” Weiner said.
Wegman expressed his excitement to exhibit his work at the Lombardi Center.
“What an amazing place to have a show,” Wegman said. “It really is much better than the Whitney, or even the [Museum of Modern Art].”
He added that events like this one are a reason why he loves art.
“I became an artist because I liked to show off what I did and make people happy. A big turning point when you’re an artist it to show your work to someone who isn’t your mom, your best friend or your aunt and have him or her say, ‘That’s really good.’ This is total gratification for me,” Wegman said.
Langley expressed her appreciation for Wegman, who is helping patients to build a community and process their illness.
“He is generous with his time and his commentary. People have come out to see him because they think he does something special. We need that here at Lombardi. We need those uplifting and happy moments,” Langley said. “Art is one of the ways that I feel better about life and that I feel more optimistic. I think creativity is a great gift and a way to stave off fear.”

OWN IT, a student initiative that aims to connect students with women in leadership in leadership, announced last Wednesday that it will host its second annual OWN IT Summit March 28 in Gaston Hall. Over 50 speakers and an expected 800 attendees, 400 more than at last year’s summit, are anticipated to attend.
The summit was founded in 2013 with the mission of bridging the gap between college-aged women and professional, industry-leading women by hosting a series of panels and workshops.
OWN IT, which was housed within the Georgetown University Women In Leadership last year, is now working independently with guidance from the university’s Office of Communications.
This year, the summit will expand in both size and scope. The first OWN IT summit took place in the Lohrfink Auditorium with 400 attendees and 30 speakers.
Last year, tickets for the summit sold out in one day, despite the fact that a list of speakers had yet to be released. Tickets for this year go on sale Feb. 13 on OWN IT’s website.
According to Summit Co-Founder Helen Brosnan (SFS ’16), this year’s summit will feature a variety of changes including a new format. Brosnan declined to comment on the speakers, which will be announced in the upcoming months.
“We are changing the format by trying to include a few more fun elements in the day — some performances, and a few surprises that you’ll see as it gets closer,” Brosnan said.
The summit will also see the addition of non-industry specific panels in an effort to highlight the overlap of professionalism and success between industries. To do this, the panels will be organized by the four themes: inspiration, image, innovation and impact.
“Those are our four themes for our four panels,” Brosnan said. “[This] allows us to have cross-industry, more stimulating conversation. Women across fields have a lot of similarities.”
Despite several changes to its format, the core goals and values of this year’s summit remain the same, according to Director of Speakers Allyn Rosenberger (COL ’17).
“The main theme is really to bridge the gap between women in leadership positions and the millennials who admire them,” Rosenberger said. “All too often we are faced with powerful women talking to other powerful women, and that really isn’t very inspiring to us college students. This is a way to challenge that and make female leaders and leadership events much more accessible.”
Georgetown University’s OWN IT Deputy of Logistics Sarah Clements (COL ’18) said she promises that the summit will also retain its emphasis on creating a similar tight-knit environment from last year.
“A criticism that often comes with these types of events that bring together powerful people is that they end up talking in circles to themselves — other powerful people,” Clements wrote in an email to The Hoya. “OWN IT is going to be different. Speakers and students alike are ‘participants’ and we hope to build an environment through small breakout sessions and even smaller ‘office hours’ where both speakers and attendees are learning and building from each other.”
Brosnan said that they will also work to create an even more friendly atmosphere at the conference this year.
“We got a lot of positive feedback from last year about the level of comfort that people got at this event,” Brosnan said. “We tried our hardest to make it feel like you were walking into a room of potential friends, and that’s something that we’re trying to hammer home this year as well. Even though you’re in a huge venue, you’re still surrounded by 800 girls and industry leaders who want to talk to you.”
Summit Co-Founder Kendall Ciesemier (COL ’15) said that student interest and involvement in the summit has increased significantly since last year, as planning stages began last September.
“We have an awesome team,” Ciesemier said. “From freshmen to seniors, we have gotten more people involved this year.”
Due to the success of last year’s OWN IT Summit at Georgetown, other schools have expressed interest and have begun plans for their own summits. According to Ciesemier, Washington University at St. Louis, Boston College and Howard University have reached out to OWN IT via Facebook or email after the success of the summit last year.
“We [co-founders] decided that we wanted to bring this amazing event to our campus because we didn’t feel that there was an event that encapsulated all the aims of OWN IT. There are plenty of leadership events for the females of a specific academic school or sponsored by alumni, but we felt the campus was lacking a student driven initiative of women empowering women,” Ellen Kaushansky, co-chair of the Summit at Washington University St. Louis wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Ciesemier and Brosnan have been helping these schools develop their own OWN IT programs.
“We give them a guide book to help them structure this and figure out what the best tactics are,” Brosnan said. “We also help them with logistics, how to build a team, a website, and the best ways to reach out to people. They do a lot of work by themselves though, [as it is] very much what works for their school.”
Kiana Knolland, the OWN IT Summit ambassador at Howard University, said that she was inspired by Georgetown’s inaugural conference.
“The incomparable work they’ve done on Georgetown’s campus is absolutely remarkable and I am excited that OWN IT is expanding to Howard University,” Knolland wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Never has it been more important for women to confidently move in the direction of their career dreams and unapologetically embrace their strengths and imperfections. Our main objective is to inspire the young women on our campus and to connect them with women who understand their journey and plight.”
Rosenberger said that she is honored that other schools have expressed an interest in replicating the summit.
“The fact that we have spread to three other schools is my favorite bragging point when it comes to talking about the summit,” Rosenberger said.
“The fact that young women at other schools want to help us spread our message is amazing. It makes me even more proud to be a part of the planning team.”
According to Brosnan, each school’s summit will retain its own uniqueness.
“We don’t think we should have carbon copies of the same summit,” Brosnan said. “[Working with other schools] is a nice way to unite similar forces together. Why all work against each other when we could all be working with each other?”

Is there any particular reason this was set as the same date as the Ignatian Q conference?
The Ignatian Q conference is an LGBTQ and allies conference held at Georgetown.

Helen Brosnan says 
February 9, 2015 at 9:18 am
Hi Nora, 
Unfortunately, we have had this date since September. We did not know the date of ignatianQ until yesterday — we are getting in touch with some of the organizers today to find out more information about their schedule for that weekend. We try our best to avoid conflict with all major events at Georgetown and in the rest of the world as we choose our summit date, but unfortunately events always slip through the cracks and this is one of those times. We wish the ignatianQ summit the best of luck on a successful event and we value the conversation it will be bringing to campus!

In an effort to create greater transparency of instructors’ statuses as students within the Faculty of Languages and Linguistics, Georgetown University Student Association Senator At-Large Adam Shinbrot (COL ’18) has introduced a bill that seeks to make students more aware of the doctoral candidate program in the department.
The bill notes that “there is a well-regarded program that these instructors must complete to become teachers of such classes,” and says students deserve to have a better understanding of the program as well as know who to contact with questions or concerns.
Shinbrot, unaware that Ph.D. students went through instruction prior to teaching classes, initially proposed a bill which sought to prevent doctoral candidates from being instructors.
“When I looked into this, I realized that there was a rigorous set of evaluations that these doctoral candidates have to go through,” Shinbrot said. “They have to go through training, and I think students should know this so there is more clarity.”
Shinbrot has also created a petition in an effort to demonstrate student support for his bill and raise awareness of the issue, which he says is lacking throughout the student body.
“If I don’t know [about the program], and I’m a German major, odds are that well over half of the students in language courses have no idea,” said GUSA Senator Tyler Bridge (COL ’17).
In the linguistics program, Ph.D. students must take a yearlong class on how to be an instructor.
Following that, they must submit a portfolio of their work. They then become teaching assistants, and if the professor approves of their work, they may co-teach a class and eventually may have the chance to teach a class by themselves.
According to both Shinbrot and Bridge, one of the biggest problems that the bill looks to address is the lack of clarity regarding whom students should contact if they have a question or suggestion.
While students may contact the department chair or the director of the program, Shinbrot suggests putting the contact information of the person responsible for the Ph.D. program in the syllabus as a solution to this problem.
“This is not difficult to do and it would make students happy,” Shinbrot said. “Put that in the syllabus or talk about it during syllabus week. It’s that easy.”
Ph.D. students do not teach classes in every department of the FLL, and some departments do not have a Ph.D. program at all.
The linguistics, German, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese departments all have graduate programs and use doctoral candidates as instructors.
Last semester Sydney Brooks (COL ’18), a prospective linguistics major, took an introductory course co-taught by two Ph.D. students.
She said that while they did mention that they had taught before, she was unaware of any training and would not have known whom to contact had she noticed any problems with the teaching style of her professor.
“I don’t know who I would be looking for within the linguistics department,” Brooks said. “I think that it would be reassuring to students to be aware of the training their instructors have received, as well as a specific contact if problems arise.”
Shinbrot and Bridge hope that this bill will allow students like Brooks to have a better understanding of their instructors and how to navigate the departments in question.
“We’re not calling for doctoral students to step down, and we’re not calling on departments to stop doing anything,” Bridge said. “Before this, there was no discussion about this topic and no transparency about what happens. This is the first step to change things.”

But why? So students who are pissed that they didn’t get an easy B+ in a class they don’t study for can call up the PhD coordinator with some “suggestions”? Give me a break.

Georgetown University’s Designing the Future(s) of the University Initiative received $1.7 million in alumni donations and a $4 million anonymous gift at the end of January.
The gifts will allow the initiative, launched in 2013, to explore how best to design a liberal arts education for the increasingly globalized future and discover ways to make higher education more student-centered.
“The fact that this project is funded entirely through philanthropy is a testament to the value that alumni place on their Georgetown education,” University President John J. DeGioia wrote in a statement. “These gifts, combined with donations from partner organizations, are helping the university adapt to the demands of the 21st century.”
Vice Provost for Education Randall Bass said that the donors expressed a desire to make substantive changes to the future of higher education. According to Bass, the initiative’s staff has yet to decide exactly what specific projects the donations will fund.
“All of the alumni gifts are specifically for the reinvention of higher ed, so they’re alumni who in particular have been inspired and excited by the Designing the Future(s) Initiative,” Bass said.
Provost Robert Groves said he believes previous successes of the initiative have inspired donors to fund the project.
“The internal investments that Georgetown made in academic year 2012-2013 have paid great dividends to innovation in the classroom already,” Groves said. “The recent decisions for multiple funding sources to support these efforts with their money gives us great confidence that our strategy has value.”
The university has been involved in higher education development and future planning projects since 2000 with the creation of the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, which has helped developed seven massive open online courses since 2013.
In addition, the university developed the Initiative on Technology-Enhanced Learning in 2012 to incorporate $8 million of technology into the university learning experience. The Designing the Future(s) program adds on to these initiatives, allowing future planning to extend to the university curriculum.
Bass said he believes that the faculty involvement aspect of the Designing the Future(s) Initiative will help modernize education on campus.
“The best part is that it’s faculty-driven,” Bass said. “A lot of the programs, or a lot of the experiments are really focused on trying to find ways to create more credit-bearing interactions between faculty and students outside of the traditional classroom and trying to take some of those experiences that students find are so valuable for their education and moving them from the co-curriculum where they don’t get credit for them.”
According to Bass, this initiative will provide students with a chance to tailor their education to their specific interests.
“We’re also trying to find ways to help students develop even more personalized pathways through Georgetown, in ways that fit their passions and interests, and try to remove some of the boundaries between the units that allow people to cross schools and cross campuses and to take even more advantage of all of the resources Georgetown has to offer,” Bass said.
Education and Academic Affairs Director Catherine Armour said that the alumni donations will be the key to success in the initiative.
“Georgetown is very fortunate to have committed donors engaged in looking to our future and philanthropically supporting the Designing the Future(s) initiative both through large and small gifts,” Armour said. “These gifts will literally make the difference — funding curricular experiments which contribute to a sustainable and forward-facing Georgetown education.”
One of the new projects that the Designing the Future(s) Initiative is developing is a minor or certificate in writing, design and communication with no required courses. Instead of course work, students would work on their own projects to complete the requirements.
“We’re going to be piloting this program — that rather than relying on courses or seat time — will award credit for projects completed, so students will be participating in a studio environment in which they are creating writing design or communications projects,” Professor Margaret Debelius said. “They might come out of course work or they might come out of work that students did in an internship, or in a community based learning setting, or in a study abroad program. …This project-based learning is meant to harness some of that energy.”
Debelius said she felt that the gift would allow professors to explore new and innovative options for the Georgetown curriculum.
“What the gift is really going to allow us to do is to do some curricular experimentation … to be able to test several different models is a great use of the gift, and once we know more, we can make some other decisions,” Debelius said.

Georgetown University Law Center’s Harrison Institute for Housing and Community Development guided the restoration of the Sierra Cooperative, an affordable housing complex in northwest Washington, D.C. that was almost completely unlivable in 2012 but made a full recovery and celebrated its grand opening Jan. 22.
The Harrison Institute, which was founded in 1972 by adjunct law professor Jason Newman as the Project for Community Legal Assistance, is one of the longest-running legal clinics in the country, focused on providing legal advice to craft policy and assisting housing and community development. Harrison Institute Director and law professor Michael Diamond said preserving affordable housing in the district is an important cause.
“I think that more of this needs to be done,” Diamond said. “In the city, affordable housing is disappearing and preserving it and increasing the supply is a critical need.”
In conjunction with this mission, the Harrison Institute provided legal and developmental consultation for the Sierra Cooperative project and also helped to gather funds to restore the cooperative, which was in shambles before the project.
“The building had been sufficiently damaged. The roof had caved in five or six years ago and there wasn’t money to fix it apparently and water poured into the building ruining walls, ruining systems. You’d walk in the front door and you couldn’t breathe because of the smell of mold that just permeated the entire building,” Diamond said.
Despite the conditions, four residents remained in the building, while the other 16 spaces remained unoccupied.
“The real heroes in this project were the four brave and determined residents who decided they were not going to leave their homes despite unbearable challenges. I applaud the Sierra residents’ grit and determination and am thankful that I had the opportunity to help make a meaningful and positive difference in their lives,” Harrison Institute lead attorney Raquel Skinner said.
The restored cooperative, which is located in the Eckington neighborhood, includes 20 units of affordable housing, with tenants ranging from people at or below 30 percent of the median income to 80 percent of the area income. Diamond said the total project cost about $2.7 million.
“We took on the job of both developing the property and being a lawyer for the property,” he said. “There wasn’t enough money to do most things except keep the most basic services afloat and we helped get money to make immediate repairs on certain things and then to make the long-term repair.”
Skinner described the obstacles the project faced during restoration.
“One significant hurdle involved fixing a water pipe that burst during one of the coldest days of the winter last year, which materially increased the cost of the renovation,” Skinner said. “A constant challenge that we had to deal with was making sure that the financing for the deal was able to cover renovation work for the building.”
Despite challenges, Diamond said the residents of the Sierra Cooperative were extremely helpful.
“There was pretty much no problem with the residents,” he said. “The residents met regularly as a group to make decisions and made the decisions that they had to make to move forward. They both survived in these conditions and developed a capacity to move forward in those conditions, which is pretty really remarkable.”
In addition to the Sierra Cooperative project, the Harrison Institute has also recently gotten involved with the restoration of Capitol Manner Cooperative and Paul Dunbar Apartments in the Columbia Heights neighborhood.

Cultural anthropologist of digital culture and Professor in Residence at the University of California, Irvine Mimi Ito spoke about the importance of implementing digital learning and the educational opportunities presented by technology Monday evening in the Fisher Colloquium of the Rafik B.

The event, including a question-and-answer session moderated by Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia, was a part of the 2014-2015 speaker series Designing The Future(s), a Georgetown initiative tasked with engaging the entire Georgetown community in exploring solutions to issues facing higher education.
Ito began the presentation by conversing with the audience about the statistics of media use in children, and she expressed how traditional literacy in the form of reading books and writing is consistent in our digital age.
“In many ways the values surrounding our education, about learning, they have not changed, but the world outside of the classroom has changed tremendously in terms of the opportunities offered,” Ito said.
According to Ito, students continue to seek information through digital delivery and new formats, including MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), made popular by venues such as Coursera and iTunesU.
“This is the challenge we are facing as educators — is that we are experiencing and living through a culture clash between the modes of instruction we have institutionalized and how young people are actually going about sharing and accessing information in an era of abundance and free-flowing information,” Ito said.
Ito then spoke about the university as an entity, a place for students to find their place in the world, as an anchor at the center of a connected learning network.
“The question that we are all struggling with is not this question of values or learning philosophy, but what does it really look like to have the university, our research, the courses we teach, the faculty-student relationships, really reflect an era of information abundance where the university is in an open network whether we want it to be or not,” Ito said.
Ito concluded by citing examples such as “#PHONAR” at Coventry University, a photography course taught with a hashtag, connecting courses in which professors at universities across the globe use MOOC technology to teach. This realization led Ito to co-found the Connected Courses project, an online course exploring connected learning in higher education.
“We are trying to catalyze a community of faculty to support one another and build an affinity network, find other people in their discipline who they can connect with to not only expand their professional practices… but also their educational practice,” Ito said.
Following the presentation, President John J. DeGioia asked Ito how connected learning can be implemented at Georgetown.
“The biggest personal ‘aha’ to me for connected courses was that faculty have to experience the connected learning through connecting with others online,” Ito said.
In response to DeGioia’s inquiry about how to recruit exceptionally talented and creative students, Ito emphasized that modern-day admissions criteria at traditional universities ought to be revised and experimented with to garner a more passionate student body.
“If you look at the roster of things young people are supposed to master to get into a good school, is that really reflecting what you are looking for in your freshman class?” Ito asked.
“Increasingly, the over-management of young people’s high school careers in order to meet admissions requirements is stifling the kind of problem-solving exploration, the ability to care about the world, that you are actually looking for [in admissions]. Is there anything in how you structure admissions that could maybe surface that more?”
Vice Provost for Education at Georgetown Professor Randall Bass said that Ito’s emphasis on connected learning and encouraging a passionate student body got at the heart of the Designing the Future(s) initiative and are issues the university should take a close look at.
“I think the question is whether we create enough space for students to pursue their passions,” Bass said.“Do we create enough space when students first get here to give them the room to pursue a passion, to connect to a community, to do the kinds of things that Professor Ito was asking? It certainly happens for some students. It certainly happens eventually, but could we be doing more by design for it to happen earlier?”
Zackary Abu-Akeel (SFS ’18) said he appreciated Georgetown’s commitment to look at new forms of higher education through garnering input from speakers like Ito.
“I know that Georgetown always prides itself in being a traditional university, and I am excited to see the ways that it can modernize teaching, taking into account its traditional values,” Abu-Akeel said.
Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16) said she admired Ito’s perspective on technology and its role in positively influencing education.
“I think Georgetown sometimes is hesitant to adapt a lot of technology-based learning because they are afraid it is going to sacrifice the classroom education Georgetown covets, but I think that Ito’s talk showed that it can actually propel discussions in the classroom and even make that conversation more productive,” McNaughton said.
