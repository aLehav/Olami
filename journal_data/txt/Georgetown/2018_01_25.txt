The demolition process for the Kober-Cogan Building began Monday with the installation of a fenced perimeter around the building and parts of the adjacent parking lot as the first stage of construction for the new MedStar Georgetown University Hospital’s medical and surgical pavilion.
The installation of the fence Monday is the first phase of the removal of hazardous materials, such as asbestos, from Kober-Cogan in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency guidelines.
Kober-Cogan, located between the Leavey Center and the MedStar parking lot, was closed indefinitely in May 2010 after the discovery of mold in the building. The university relocated its occupants to the main medical center and shut off all ventilating systems in the building.
Kober-Cogan housed the psychiatry department and served as a part of the hospital.
The removal of hazardous materials is anticipated to last until June, according to a report released by Georgetown University Planning and Facilities Management in May 2017.
Construction is planned to occur between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. during the week, with limited noise from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. on weekdays and 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. on weekends in observation of campuswide quiet hours.
Work on the pavilion and a new road across from the French Embassy on Reservoir Road is also set to commence in spring 2018. Plans for a new road were approved in June 2016 as part of the 2017-36 Campus Plan.
In accordance with Washington, D.C. zoning regulations, all universities in the District must submit campus plan agreements that outline student and campus growth to the zoning commission every 10 years.
The decision to raze Kober-Cogan rather than renovate it came in part due to the challenges posed by limited existing infrastructure, according to the Master Planning website of Georgetown University Planning and Facilities Management.
The new facilities were developed to tackle the problems experienced by the current MedStar complex, which has not had a large-scale renovation in decades. Issues that MedStar faces range from limited capacity and overcrowded emergency rooms to aging infrastructure.
MedStar President Michael Sachtleben told The Hoya in November that the hospital needs improved facilities.
“We are in aged facilities,” Sachtleben said. “In fact, in the main building, where my office is and where we still care for patients today, was dedicated by Harry Truman.”

Collaboration between local leaders across the United States is crucial to addressing both local and national challenges, Mayors Francis Suarez (R) of Miami, Fla., Pete Buttigieg (D) of South Bend, Ind., and Lydia Mihalik (R) of Findlay, Ohio, said Tuesday night at an event cosponsored by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, the Georgetown Global Cities Initiative and the United States Conference of Mayors.
The event was moderated by Sheila Foster, a professor of law and public policy at the Georgetown University Law Center.
The event, which served as the GGCI’s first public offering, provided a forum for local officials to address their leadership in the face of the federal gridlock. Topics ranged from climate change resiliency and regionalism to the importance of cross-national governmental collaboration.
Suarez, who took office in November, said that local mayors can often be more effective than government at the state and federal levels dominated by party politics.
“We [mayors] look at the world as problem, solution,” Suarez said. “We don’t look at the world through a partisan lens.”
This pragmatic policymaking has allowed Miami to combat climate change by adopting resiliency efforts, Suarez added. To prevent flooding from rising seas, Miami officials promised last year to spend about $200 million on improved storm drainage systems, seawalls and flood pumps, according to the Miami Herald.
Buttigieg, who was elected in 2012 at the age of 29 as America’s youngest mayor of a city with about 100,000 people, offered regionalism as a solution to govern U.S. cities and towns.
“What we found is that we rise and fall as a region, and rather than try to all fight each other for our little parochial interests, what we really need to do is make sure that the region as a whole is better off,” Buttigieg said.
The South Bend mayor, who was a candidate for the Democratic National Committee chairmanship in February 2017, emphasized regionalism as a way for the United States to remain economically competitive against China.
“At a time when there are obscure, minor cities of 5 to 10 million in China, the idea that our big competition is from a nearby rural county just is no longer keeping up with the times,” Buttigieg said.
Mihalik, who became the first female mayor of Findlay upon her election in 2012, also emphasized the importance of collaboration. She promoted idea-sharing between local governments, touting the United States Conference of Mayors as a good example of collaboration.
“Mayors are really good at sharing passionately and stealing shamelessly,” Mihalik said, attributing her paraphrase to a common saying among mayors.
Tom Cochran, CEO and executive director of the USCM, said he was optimistic about the prospects for the United States under the mayors’ leadership.
“I’ve never had so much hope in America as I’ve had with this new crop of mayors that we have elected,” Cochran said. “I believe that if you are students of public service, look at the cities, look at the local level, and watch these mayors. You are looking at the future of America.”
Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), GU Politics executive director, is also optimistic about the future of politics, describing Suarez, Mihalik and Buttigieg as good examples for young people as they pursue leadership and public service roles in their communities.
“Too often in politics, I think that people are under the impression that they have to wait for their turn before they can be elevated to positions of leadership,” Elleithee said. “Well, here are three young people who seized an opportunity to make change in their local communities and are doing it every day, putting partisanship aside to just get things done.”
Kathryn Blanco (COL ’21) said the event inspired her to continue to explore the processes of local government.  
“I liked seeing how politics, or not even so much politics as governance, works on a local level, because it’s not something you hear about a lot on the news,” Blanco said. “It’s something I want to learn more about.”

Anti-sexual assault activist and educator Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17) has been selected to serve on the Biden Foundation’s advisory council for ending violence against women, the foundation announced Monday.
The Biden Foundation is a nonprofit organization launched last year by former Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden. Its mission includes advocacy in a wide range of policy areas, including LGBTQ and gender equality, foreign policy and the advancement of community colleges.
The foundation’s 16-member council is composed of activists, professors and leaders with expertise in women’s issues, according to the Biden Foundation’s website.
Hinerfeld has extensive experience as an activist against sexual assault. She previously interned for the Violence Against Women Team in the Office of the Vice President during Biden’s term and for the National Domestic Violence Hotline.
At Georgetown, she worked as a sexual assault peer educator, served on the board of Take Back the Night, a campus sexual assault and domestic violence advocacy group, and advocated for improved campus sexual assault prevention and response through the Georgetown University Student Association and viewpoints published in The Hoya.
Hinerfeld said she is excited to work at the Biden Foundation with a group of experts.
“I am incredibly excited to work alongside many of my heroes in this work,” Hinerfeld wrote. “I hope to learn how to be a more effective advocate and to offer a younger perspective to this work. Together, I hope that we can make violence against women obsolete.”
Hinerfeld said violence against women is prevalent on college campuses.
One in three women in the United States will experience domestic violence in their lifetimes, with women between the ages of 18 and 24 being the most likely victims of violent abuse by an intimate partner, according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.
Moreover, one in five women and one in 16 men will experience sexual assault while attending university, with LGBTQ students facing much higher levels of violence, according to a 2016 report by the Department of Justice.
“These statistics matter — they each represent millions of lives touched by violence — disrupted educations, broken families, and lives ended much too soon,” Hinerfield wrote. “By focusing on prevention and bringing an end to these cycles, we can ensure that all Americans are able to lead lives free of violence.”
Hinerfeld said her passion for advocacy started during her time in high school in Portland, Ore., when she co-founded a nonprofit called Youth Ending Slavery, which focused on combatting sex trafficking in the region.
The urge to fight for justice for the most vulnerable members of society drove Hinerfeld to apply to Georgetown and study social justice, she said.
On campus, Hinerfeld served as co-chair of the Georgetown’s Sexual Assault and Misconduct Task Force.
Established in June 2016, the task force advised the university on the issue of sexual assault and misconduct on campus and suggested policies to combat it, particularly by increasing reporting of incidents, knowledge of resources and trust in its policies and procedures, Hinerfeld said.
Laura Cutway, Georgetown’s Title IX coordinator who worked with Hinerfield on the task force, said Hinerfeld’s advocacy work hugely benefitted sexual assault survivors on campus.
“Olivia is an incredibly talented individual,” Cutway wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I was impressed by her work ethic and sincere dedication to supporting survivors of campus sexual violence in new and different ways.”
Cutway said Hinerfeld’s desire for meaningful social impact will instigate further positive change.
“Her powerful voice, coupled with her relentless passion for change, will be a true asset to the Biden Foundation and to the countless individuals she will knowingly and unknowingly impact in the future,” Cutway wrote.

While the federal government was shut down for about 69 hours between Saturday morning and Monday evening, the Washington, D.C. local government remained open using funds granted by a 2017 provision introduced by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), the District’s nonvoting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives.
The provision, which was included in the fiscal year 2017 omnibus appropriations bill and signed into law by Congress on May 5, 2017, allowed the D.C. local government to access local funds during the recent shutdown. The D.C. budget includes federal and local funds.
The government shutdown began early Saturday morning after Congress failed to pass an appropriations bill and the continuing resolution that had kept it open for the past four weeks expired.
The bill was a forward-looking provision in anticipation of a potential shutdown, a spokesperson for Norton’s office told The Hoya.
The shutdown exemption was included for the first time following the 16-daylong federal government shutdown in 2013, and has been included in the spending bill every year since. Before the provision, the District had to prepare contingency plans whenever there was a threat of federal furloughs.
“The D.C. government has done its job and passed a budget and should not be caught up like a bystander paying the price for congressional gridlock,” Norton said in a Jan. 20 news release.
According to Norton’s website, the provision was the first step in her campaign to achieve budget and legislative autonomy for the District.
Prior to the shutdown, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) called a news conference Jan. 19 informing residents the D.C. government would be open regardless of a federal government shutdown.
Bowser’s press secretary LaToya Foster said the provision introduced by Norton is what allowed all D.C. government agencies to continue operation.
“The District isn’t vulnerable to federal shutdowns because Congresswoman Eleanor introduced the bill a couple years ago,” Foster said in an interview with The Hoya. “Everything is still functioning as normal — D.C. government agencies, public schools, hospitals — everything is still open.”
The D.C. government remained operational during the 2013 shutdown by using a special reserve fund.
In a Jan. 20 news release, Bowser announced agencies that had operated with no negative impact from the federal government shutdown. These included the D.C. Fire and Emergency Management Services, D.C. Public Schools, Department of Energy and the Environment, Department of Health, Department of Housing and Community Development, Metropolitan Police Department and the Office of the State Superintendent of Education.
A number of federal tourist attractions remained open, including the National Mall, the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, though some were unstaffed. The sites were able to remain open Monday using leftover funds from the 2017 fiscal year appropriation, however.
The Department of Employment Services would provide furloughed and uncontracted federal government employees with unemployment compensation benefits for the period of the shutdown, Bowser announced in a Jan. 20 news release.
The department anticipated approximately 17,000 federal employees would be furloughed, based on counts from the 16-daylong federal government shutdown of 2013, according to Tiffany Browne, public affairs consultant for the department.
Browne said furloughed federal employees were able to file claims online or in person.
“A representative from the unemployment insurance compensation department was assisting walk-ins at our DOES headquarters, but for the most part people were able to file their claims online,” Browne said in an interview with The Hoya.
Legislation ending the federal shutdown Monday night has since guaranteed pay for federal employees put on unpaid furlough during the shutdown.
