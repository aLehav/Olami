A locked room in Village C East was burglarized over the weekend, the Department of Public Safety reported.
The incident occurred between August 1 at 6:00 p.m. and August 5 at 2:10 p.m., when an unknown intruder entered the secured room and stole several personal items. The room door, originally locked, was found unsecured when the student returned from a weekend trip.
There is currently no description available of the suspects. DPS requests that anyone with information regarding the incident contact them immediately.
