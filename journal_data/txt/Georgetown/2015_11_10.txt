The permanent rerouting of four Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle lines has resulted in longer waiting times and mixed responses from riders, as the McDonough Bus Turnaround opened yesterday.
As per the 2010 Campus Plan, in which the university agreed to lessen noise and traffic congestion in the surrounding neighborhood, the Dupont Circle, Georgetown University Law Center, Rosslyn and Arlington routes now enter and exit via Canal Road.
In conjunction with the route restructuring, there is no longer GUTS service at the Car Barn route to Rosslyn, Va., via Prospect Street.
The Georgetown University Student Association implemented an online survey yesterday immediately after the changes to garner student and faculty opinion on the change. After the first day of implementation, according to GUSA Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16), student feedback on the route changes has registered as primarily negative.
“It’s only day one and we’ve already been inundated with student concerns. If I wanted to attend a university where it takes over a half-hour to get into D.C., I would’ve stayed in Fairfax, Va.,” Rohan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “If the unreasonable transit times being reported are not soon drastically reduced, GUSA will respond accordingly.”
GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) said he waited 33 minutes for the bus to Dupont Circle, and that he will communicate riders’ issues to the administration.
“I had a highly disappointing experience today between the amount of time in transit and abnormally long lines to even board the bus,” Luther wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In the immediate future, we will be closely examining and scrutinizing people’s experience with the new route and working with the administration to remedy the issue should the problem persist.”
Riders have commented on the inconvenience of long wait times for GUTS shuttles and an increase in the distance required to travel from the turnaround to other locations on campus.
According to Christian Zeballos (GRD ’16), the time it takes to walk from the GUTS shuttles to class will make the changes inconvenient.
“I guess it’s slightly inconvenient because I have to walk a little bit further than I used to,” Zeballos said. “It’s definitely a bit more of a walk.”
In a universitywide email sent on Friday, Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said the change was motivated by Georgetown’s vision for a more connected living and learning experience.
“This strategic initiative is part of the university’s broad vision of connecting the academic, recreation and social hubs on campus,” Morey wrote. “The Bus Turnaround is consistent with our goal of moving traffic away from the center of campus to make campus more pedestrian-friendly.”
The Wisconsin Avenue shuttle will remain in its current route, with a pickup at the top of Wisconsin Avenue.
Passengers will have access to new amenities including covered bus shelters and seating, which are projected to be installed over the winter break.
According to Morey, as part of the university’s effort to increase sustainability, the turnaround also features a rain garden to help with rainwater management. Morey emphasized the positive safety benefits that the route change will incur on the student body.
“In general I think that the population at large is better served because the core of our campus is now protected; we don’t have buses coming through there, [creating] more of a pedestrian-friendly environment, less traffic and obstructions to walk around campus,” Morey said.
The university has also been actively working with the District Department of Transportation to prepare for the GUTS changes and address congestion along Canal Road. To ensure a smooth transition, the DDOT posted traffic control officers at the Canal Road campus exit during the evening rush hour.
Taylor Willis (SFS ’16) lives off campus in Crystal City, Va., and commutes to Georgetown on the Rosslyn, Va., bus. He said that he expects to be inconvenienced by the change in location.
“On the one hand, there’s a chance this change makes it take less time to get from Georgetown to Rosslyn, but it does so by eliminating … where I usually get on,” Willis said. “I guess I’m willing to give it a try before saying it’s not worth it, but my hopes aren’t high.”
Kim Zagory, a commuter and administrative assistant at the Medstar Georgetown University Hospital, who was quoted in an earlier article (“GUTS Bus Lines Rerouted, Sparks Commuter Criticism,” Sept. 18, 2015, The Hoya), said she is concerned with the long walk from the turnaround to the hospital.
“It’s a pain,” Zagory said. “It’s a long walk and that’s problematic, particularly for patients who may have mobility problems or people who are ill. It’s a hospital.”
To alleviate mobility concerns, a new minishuttle will be available for riders who require assistance or desire a more convenient route to north campus. This shuttle will drive passengers from the lot outside the hospital back and forth from the bus turnaround.
According to Morey, these shuttles are expected to run three to four minutes apart, and will run on a continuous loop throughout the day.
Tami Lacasse (SFS ’18), a weekly GUTS rider, said she is not bothered by the change.
“I do not believe that it will change very much, although it might be a longer distance going from class to the bus stop,” Lacasse said. “I don’t see it as being a big problem.”
Leslie Martin (GRD ’16) said she believes the switch will add to campus safety and foster a more pedestrian-friendly campus.
“I think it’s a good move because it makes campus more pedestrian-friendly, which is really important to me, with safety involved. … Overall, I liked the drive better this morning, it was a lot smoother,” Martin said.
According to GUSA Secretary for Campus Planning Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), data from test trips on the new routes show longer travel times on the Dupont route during peak evening hours, while the Dupont and Rosslyn routes will be a few minutes faster during peak morning hours.
“The potential for increased route times … is concerning,” Goldstein said. “We’ll be able to see those effects as the turnaround goes into use over the next few months.”
According to the GUSA Campus Plan Report, the shuttles make two million individual trips per year. The report also stated that 32 percent of GUTS riders are students.
In response to the time increase, Morey said that GUTS plans to add an extra bus during peak hours in the future.
“We’re going to try to achieve a headway of 10 minutes,” Morey said. “If you walk to a stop, whether it’s at Dupont or here on campus, [and] you walk up there at 6:51, theoretically a bus has just left [and] you’re waiting nine minutes for the next bus.”
GUSA has been involved in meetings with administrators regarding the planned changes for the past two years. According to Goldstein, GUSA hopes to continue the conversation surrounding the quantity and quality of access to transportation at Georgetown throughout the 2018 campus-planning process.
“It’s important that the university continue to demonstrate its commitment to the student and rider experience of GUTS,” Goldstein said.
Goldstein said that the new GUTS routes are the beginning of a renewed focus on transportation.
“Hopefully that will mean another look at … expanded access to Zipcar and Capital Bike Share on campus to facilitate other access to transportation, and a renewed conversation with students about the effects of the bus turnaround on their daily routines,” Goldstein said.
Hoya Staff Writer Matthew Larson contributed reporting.

This new route is absolute bullshit. It’s like we’re located in a suburb. I’m sure that they’ll still play up the university’s location “within the city” during admissions, but these changes make the city inaccessible. Google Maps says that the journey to Dupont Circle from Georgetown Hospital should take 10 to 14 minutes- the way that the GUTS is set up currently takes over 30. If we want to talk about “sustainability,” why don’t we talk about the fact that we’re doubling carbon emissions? If we’re talking about student quality of life, why aren’t we talking about over 30 unnecessary minutes being added to daily commutes? It’s not like students have the option to drive themselves, because the fascist neighbors won’t let us have cars.
Georgetown administrators: Don’t you see that you have leverage? Are you so blind and weak that you’d rather spare yourself the whining of some ANC commissioners than actually serve students? There is more student resentment toward you and the neighbors than any other time in modern history. You break up our parties, you make our travel difficult, you construct unnecessary dorms. Very few students feel like you have our best interest at heart. You better start changing that before you cross a line, and with this GUTS change, you already may have.

District of Columbia Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) has introduced a bill that would lower the voting age from 18 to 16 for municipal and federal elections held in Washington, D.C.
Councilmembers David Grosso (I-At Large) and Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1) are co-sponsoring the bill. Even if the council passes the measure, Congress must approve it before implementation. If successful, D.C. would join Takoma Park, Md., and Hyattsville, Md., as the third city in the area to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in municipal elections, but the first to allow them to vote in federal elections.
Allen explained that despite original reservations, he became more receptive to the idea after hearing from community members about the maturity of 16- and 17-year-olds. Those lobbying for the bill also expressed a desire to reconnect younger people with city politics after the District experienced a rise in youth violence this summer.
“There’s a lot of expectations that we put on [young people] … to be able to make good decisions for themselves,” Allen said. “If I trust a 16-year-old to do those things, why in the world wouldn’t I trust them to go to a voting booth?”
Grosso also noted that these younger voters can provide new perspectives and highlight issues that have been neglected in the past.
“I don’t see why we couldn’t make a pitch to younger residents to vote,” Grosso said. “If 16- and 17-year-olds are able to vote, they may be able to push some policy issues that are important for younger residents.”
Grosso also introduced a bill that would extend the right to vote in municipal elections to non-citizens. He argued that both measures are constitutional under the 26th Amendment to the Constitution, which states that citizens 18 years and older may not be prohibited from voting. However, it does not mention those younger than 18.
In the first elections since the bills were passed in Takoma Park and Hyattsville, turnout of voters aged 16 and 17 was four and two-and-a-half times, respectively, that of the rest of the entire voting demographic. Allen cited these elections as a reason to be hopeful that young people can be politically engaged.
“Statistics will show over and over again, the more frequently someone votes when they’re younger, the more likely they’re going to be a lifelong voter,” Allen said. “There’s an immense opportunity to have people start voting at that age of 16 and 17 and 18.”
Allen also explained that the right to vote will give high school students the opportunity to place their academic knowledge in a practical context.
“They’re taking history, they’re taking civics, they’re learning about the political and how they have their voice heard,” Allen said. “I think what shows you is you can get 16-and 17-year-olds to feel like they have a stake in this, to feel engaged.”
Georgetown University College Democrats President Matt Gregory (SFS ’17) expressed support for the measure but believes there will be determined opposition from Republicans in Congress because younger voters may be perceived to favor Democrats.
“In terms of partisanship, you would probably see some opposition from Republicans,” Gregory said. “D.C., just looking at it demographically, is largely Democrat if you look at the people that live there.”
Georgetown University College Republicans Chair Amber Athey (COL ’16) opposes the measure. Athey said she believes that 16-years-old is too young and that parents will heavily influence younger voters.
“I don’t know very many 16 year olds who are politically involved,” Athey said. “I think [lowering the voting age] leads to this voting pattern where people are just getting ideas from their parents.”
Leah Reinhard (COL ’18) agreed that 16 may be too young for voting.
“Having the right to vote in this country is a privilege everyone should take advantage of in this country,” Reinhard said. “However, having that opportunity at 16 is just too young to participate in the process. If they can’t legally make certain decisions as minors, how can they be expected to make decisions for our country?”

I have taught High school students, who are clue less about politics.
And this was in a highly educated area.
There is no way that lowering the voting age is going to bring more educated
voters into the system.  It is a very detrimental effort to push some sort
of left length agenda to the front by using children as pawns.

Students, graduates and working professionals from the Washington, D.C. area and beyond gathered for a daylong innovation competition focused on creating technological accessories for presidential debates to increase voter engagement among millennials.
The “Hack the Debate” event, which was hosted by Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service and the Independent Journal, took place in the Healey Family Student Center on Nov. 8.
IJ will also co-sponsor the New Hampshire Republican Primary debate with ABC News on Feb. 6.
Five teams of up to six hackers had eight hours to conceptualize, design and implement a plan to broaden the scope of millennial conversations on the debate process. The product was then pitched to technology and political industry professionals with one winner chosen at the end of the day.
Judges based their decisions on the directness, feasibility, receptiveness and originality of the team’s ideas. Judges included IJ’s Chief Technology Officer Carl Seusca, Facebook Public Policy Director Katie Harbath and Politico Executive Vice President of Business Development Peter Cherukuri.
Teams faced moderators, fact-checking and social media with pitches that ranged from a spin-off of a popular mobile game, “Cookie Clicker,” to a Tinder-inspired application, “Bull,” designed to allow debate audiences to question or support candidates’ statements in real time.
A team of product developers from Mic.com, an online news outlet, won the competition. They pitched “DebateMate,” a mobile-friendly website that centers around providing real-time rankings of emojis as they become associated with candidates on social media.
“Our idea is simple and actually works,” Mic News Vice President of Product Andrew Sessa (SFS ’09) said. “The idea of an emoji spans across all languages so it’s also useful for things outside of a debate.”
IJ will work with the DebateMate founders to develop the idea into a functional tool for audience participation in the Feb. 6 debate.
The hackathon also incorporated two panel discussions, called “Tech Talks,” and brought in professional journalists, IJ employees and other industry experts to advise the teams as they crafted their final products.
The first Tech Talk, titled “Inside the Campaign Debate,” brought Republican National Committee Digital Director Gerrit Lansing and Democratic National Committee Digital Director Matt Compton together in a dialogue on voter engagement and technological advancement on the 2016 presidential campaign trail.
The second panel, “2016 is the Year of the Debate – Thanks to Technology,” centered around real-time audience response, search trends and data aggregation during and after debates. Panelists included Government & Politics Partner Manager Sean Evins and Google’s U.S. Politics Account Executive Steve Johnston.
Michelle Jaconi, CNN veteran and current executive editor of IJ, described IJ as a company that uses technology to reach a broad and youthful audience through multimedia, multi-platform journalism.
IJ Founder and President Alex Skatell, who also currently serves as a student advisor at the IPPS, emphasized the company’s goal of providing users with news in a technology-friendly context.
“IJ is focused on showing, not telling, and listening to people on the ground, not just our viewpoints,” Skatell said.
IPPS Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) noted similarities between IJ’s mission and that of the IPPS.
“We had an early partnership with IJ because of the fact that we recognize that if our goal is to inspire young people, to show them the different avenues to get involved in public service, we actually have to start a conversation on their terms and using their tools,” Elleithee said.
According to Skatell, IJ hopes to garner the same record-breaking viewership from earlier 2016 presidential primary debates using the technological innovations produced by the competition.
“This is the first time that any network or debate partner is opening up the floor for ideas from the public at large and thinking about what should debates have to stimulate and engage and inform them,” Skatell said. “Everyone is looking forward to listening to young people and across the spectrum about how to better engage viewers and have it be a debate that’s helpful to get to know [the candidates].”
Elleithee echoed Skatell’s sentiments, highlighting that the goal  is of the hackathon to deepen the knowledge students have of political debate processes.
“It’s very much in the spirit of why we exist, to pull back the curtain and help students understand the hows and the whys but then hand it off to you to figure out how to do it better,” Elleithee said.

BBC Worldwide North America President Ann Sarnoff (GSB ’83) emphasized the importance of reimagining content in an era of mass media consumption at the Fisher Colloquium in the Rafik B. Hariri Building on Thursday.
The Georgetown University Women’s Leadership Institute organized the event, titled “The Evolution of Television.” GUWLI Director Catherine Tinsley moderated the discussion. GUWLI, which was founded in 2003, is a joint initiative between the Office of the President and the McDonough School of Business dedicated to empowering female leaders in the business sector through scientific insight and data-driven knowledge.
Sarnoff, who previously worked for Nickelodeon and Dow Jones, is known for bringing an entrepreneurial and innovative spirit into the workplace. She was responsible for large marketing and sales projects that diversified the BBC’s content department and currently works to address the future of television and content consumption.
Sarnoff said that her goal at the BBC is to address millennials and the way they are constantly redefining the concept of television and media.
“Millennials are the cord-cutters because they grew up on the Internet, watching things on their computers and on smartphones,” Sarnoff said. “The state of television is in a very exciting state of flux because at companies such as BBC, we are content creators.”
According to Sarnoff, this reimagining of television is indicative of the growing power of companies such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, especially as major television providers have begun selling their shows directly to these sites as a form of direct release.
Referring to this growth in the quantity and means of distribution of television, Sarnoff acknowledged the importance of consumer choice and demand in an age in which consumers have increasing liberty to change content providers quickly.
“A lot of British programming … is high quality, and we feel very confident that as television continues to evolve on multiple platforms, [BBC content] will rise to the top,” Sarnoff said. “But all consumers now have ultimate choice to choose what to watch when you want it, on demand. … Consumers don’t like to wait for anything.”
With the amount of choice modern-day consumers now have, Sarnoff said that there is a new emphasis on being first to market with higher-quality products.
“[Consumers] want more exclusive programming that you won’t see on any other service,” Sarnoff said. “Netflix is a prime example of this trend. … This changes our economics as content providers because now we have a different way to monetize shows. Not only can we sell to traditional cable and network providers, but also these services for first windows.”
Another key point of the conversation was the progress of content consumption in developing countries. According to Sarnoff, the evolution of television has not been equal in all countries as states often lack the infrastructure to adapt to data-intensive television practices.
Sarnoff said content producers are still seeing rapid developments in these countries, in spite of the lack of infrastructure.
“Video is very data-intensive and hard to get across networks … so it really is about the infrastructure,” Sarnoff said. “Developing countries develop the infrastructure and leapfrog the Western way of rolling out television networks, jumping straight into the on-demand content.”
Sarnoff further elaborated upon her own principles of leadership and building an efficient team. She also acknowledged creativity as the center of all innovation and progress in her industry.
“I also believe, in order to bring innovation into a culture, that you should reward failure and punish inaction,” Sarnoff said. “Celebrating and learning what we do wrong allows better decisions going forward. Through this attitude, I was able to help inspire my teams to make progress and think creatively.”
William Treanor (COL ’19) said he appreciated Sarnoff’s insights on both the television market and the role creativity plays in her leadership.
“It was incredibly interesting to see how the shows we watch on TV or Netflix represent such a small fraction of the worldwide market and reflects the decisions made by a small group of individuals,” Treanor said.
Joseph Stabile (SFS ’19) said that Sarnoff offered a unique perspective on the issue of content consumption as a female media executive.
“I found it really interesting to hear her position on the evolution of television as technology advances [and] her insights as a woman in a high-ranking business position,” Stabile said.

This year marks the 10th anniversary of the university’s implementation of the Just Employment Policy, a comprehensive agreement that ensures fair and competitive compensation packages for full-time campus workers.
Under the policy, the university has incrementally increased compensation for full-time contracted workers every two years over the last decade, reaching the minimum total compensation requirement of $16.45 per hour this January, compared to the local minimum wage of $10.50.
In addition to its wage policy, the document also recognizes existing negotiated union agreements, ensures the right to a safe and harassment-free work environment, provides workers with access to university resources such as English as a Second Language classes and permits workers to unionize without intimidation or delay.
The policy applies to both workers directly employed by the university and those employed by university contractors, such as Aramark, Epicurean and Company and Follett.
The policy is overseen by the Advisory Committee on Business Practices under the Office of Public Affairs, comprised of nine administrators and faculty members, including Associate Dean of Student Affairs Dennis Williams, McDonough School of Business professor Robert J. Bies and sociology professor Leslie Hinkson and one student, Caleb Weaver (SFS ’16). Members are appointed by the university on two-year terms.
The university enacted the policy in 2005 after repeated demonstrations by the Georgetown Solidarity Committee, which culminated in an eight-day hunger strike by 25 students in early 2005.
In commemoration of the policy’s anniversary, the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor hosted a series of three panels in Riggs Library last Thursday to discuss the origins, impact and future of the policy.
The initiative, founded in 2009, organizes projects such as educational programs for laborers and opportunities for students to participate in public policy research with professors on labor economics.
At the event, Vice President for Public Affairs Erik Smulson (CAS ’89) said the policy ensures that university business practices align with Jesuit values.
“The Just Employment Policy is really a commitment from the university to social justice and for the common good. It is very true to who we are as a university and the respect we have for the dignity of all humans and those in the workplace,” Smulson said.
KILWP Executive Director Joseph A. McCartin also said the anniversary marks an opportunity for the university to reflect on the policy.
“We look at our Just Employment Policy at Georgetown as a really great model that we hopefully can generalize and make applicable to other university settings,” McCartin said. “Part of this event was to mark what we have done over the past 10 years … but part of it was to think about what we could do better, and then to think about how we might spread this kind of idea.”
Recently, the policy has increased its influence outside of Georgetown. In the past two years, students at John Carroll University, Brandeis University and Loyola University Chicago have proposed to implement the Just Employment Policy on their campuses.
In October, McCartin represented the KILWP in a discussion of the policy’s benefits at the Summit on Worker Voice in the White House.
According to Senior Adviser to the President for Faculty Relations Lisa Krim, the administration recognizes that the policy has room for expansion in the future.
“Although a union structure only encompasses the part time faculty on our campus, we did spend time after the negotiation working directly with our full-time, non-tenured faculty to set up career tracks for them in ways to recognize the contributions that that group is entitled to,” Krim said. “So the work continues, some of it is in the union context and some of it is outside the union context, but it is all based on the same goals: respect, inclusion and really the pursuit of our mission.”
Over the past decade, university employees have used the policy numerous times to exercise their rights. In March 2011, workers at O’Donovan Hall, Cosi and Starbucks, all operated by Aramark, cited the policy in their process to unionize under UNITEHERE, a local union. Adjunct professors also used the policy in their negotiation to unionize under Local 500 of the Service Employees International Union in October 2014.
Most recently, Aramark workers cited the policy to negotiate a fair process for unionization and improved work and wage conditions at Leo’s, Hoya Court and the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center.
In an interview with The Hoya, Sam Geaney-Moore (SFS ’12), a former member of GSC and current representative of UNITEHERE Local 23, said that the policy only holds weight if enacted by the community. Geaney-Moore assisted Aramark workers in their contract renegotiation process.
“The Just Employment Policy is a powerful tool for workers, students and professors to use to protect the rights of everyone who works on campus. However, it is a tool, not a solution by itself,” Geaney-Moore said. “Students and workers must organize to promote justice for everyone who works at the university.”
Dante Crestwell, a warehouse receiver at Leo’s, said that prior to unionization, Aramark discouraged its workers from unionizing.
“You couldn’t even use the word ‘union’ and your name in the same sentence and not be called into a manager’s office,” Crestwell said. “People would get their raises at the time of the economic downturn and it was like a 6-cent or a 12-cent raise. A penny a month.”
According to Crestwell, once the university reminded Aramark of its responsibility to abide by the Just Employment Policy in an open letter, worker conditions improved.
“All of a sudden, this letter from Georgetown came about Just Employment Policy and Jesuit values and Aramark was like, ‘We can make this work, we can be friends,’” Crestwell said. “Without us unionizing, it would be a 90 percent turnover [in employees] at Leo’s.”
Kerry Danner-McDonald, an adjunct in the theology department, also said the policy was effective in pushing for the unionization of adjunct professors. Although adjunct professors are not entitled to higher wages under the policy, as they are not full-time employees, the policy allows them to assemble and unionize.
“Part of the benefit of organizing is realizing that you are making a difference and recognizing that the system is unjust and doing something about it. And I think for many of us it allows us to retain our integrity while we continue to do a job that is exploitive,” Danner-McDonald said.
Danner-McDonald agreed that the Just Employment Policy can do more to support part-time employees.
“I think one of the challenges of the Just Employment Policy is that it articulates a living wage for full-time employees, but we are not full-time,” Danner-McDonald said.
At the KILWP event, Weaver, the only student on the ABCP, said that students should engage with workers beyond expressing gratitude.
“I am sure workers have 100 people telling them, ‘You are a valued part of this community,’ but it means a lot more … when workers see students doing more than saying that, and really [live] out that statement [by] putting in the work to prove that it is true,” Weaver said.

Russian pro-democracy activist and former world chess champion Garry Kasparov encouraged Western countries to enact assertive foreign policies against Russia in a speech in the Intercultural Center Auditorium on Thursday.
The event, titled “Garry Kasparov on the Rise and Fall of Russian Democracy and Why It Matters to America and the World,” was part of Kasparov’s promotional tour for his latest book, “Winter is Coming,” a critique of the Putin regime. The Lecture Fund organized the event and distributed free copies of the book to the event’s first 150 attendees.
Kasparov, who became the youngest undisputed world chess champion in 1985 at 22 years old, described the contrast between his former role as an emblem of the Soviet Union’s intellectual superiority to the West decades ago and his current dissidence against the Russian government.
“When people ask me about my chess skills and how useful they are in navigating the hot waters of Russian politics, my answer is that they were absolutely useless,” Kasparov said. “Because in chess, you have strict rules with unpredictable results, while in Putin’s Russia it is exactly the opposite.”
Kasparov advocated for an interventionist foreign policy in order to preserve global economic interests and protect global security. According to Kasparov, the failure of the United States and its allies to intercede on behalf of democracy in Russia could potentially manifest in greater aggression from its leader.
“I’ve read enough history books to know that appeasement has killed more people than deterrence,” Kasparov said. “The lesson from history is that the weakness always provokes foreign aggression. Strength is vital in dealing with dictators, and hopefully the free world will step up to the challenge.”
Kasparov criticized American foreign policy for its failure to provide a united front in quelling the expansion of Putin’s power. He said that the lack of bipartisan consensus within the United States runs contrary to the politics of the Cold War era, which saw common goals among Democrats and Republicans.
“It comes down to making excuses and backing away from challenges,” Kasparov said. “Don’t tell me that Vladimir Putin is more dangerous than Josef Stalin in 1948. … Every day Putin stays in power, the drier the political desert in Russia. And who can survive in a political desert? Only creatures like snakes and rats and scorpions.”
Benjamin Forestier (MSB ’16), who organized the event as an associate board member of the Lecture Fund, said he studied Kasparov’s techniques to implement in his own gaming strategies as a chess player of 15 years. He said Kasparov’s advocacy work compelled him to pursue inviting Kasparov to campus since June.
“Georgetown is a Jesuit university, and though we are supposedly men and women for others, I think the biggest risk we face as students is getting too comfortable,” Forestier said. “With Mr. Kasparov, we have somebody with a brilliant mind and extraordinary achievements who left his comfort zone, who pulled himself out of safety in order to contribute to something he believes is the greater good.”
Nick Shedd (SFS ’18), who hauled his chess set to the lecture to have it signed by Kasparov, said although he had reservations about Kasparov’s foreign policy, he was swayed by his account of political oppression in Russia.
“I honestly came because I saw a post on Facebook that Kasparov was signing chessboards, and I thought that was awesome,” Shedd said. “I stayed because hearing his story and getting that insider perspective about the workings in Putin’s government was very cool, and it’s something we talked about a lot in my Russian class last year.”
Alejandro Perez-Reyes (COL ’17), a government and Russian double major, said Kasparov’s analysis oversimplified the current state of Russian affairs by attributing developments to Vladimir Putin alone, rather than to millions of processes, procedures and interests.
“In my view, he made the Russian government synonymous with Putin’s desires, and when you think about it in context, there are Russian bureaucratic agencies — different power actors — who influence what Russia does,” Perez-Reyes said.
Despite this limitation, Perez-Reyes said Kasparov offered a convincing argument in laying out a moral framework for U.S. foreign policy.
“I don’t think I will ever hear that kind of experience or perspective voiced with as much moral authority,” Perez-Reyes said. “I don’t think we can forget about that and still say that U.S. foreign policy is morally justified at all, because if we do that, we are turning our backs on people who really need our help.”

U.S. Secretary for Homeland Security Jeh Johnson called for a bipartisan response to the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States in his keynote address at the 12th annual Immigration Law and Policy Conference.
The Georgetown University Law Center, the Catholic Legal Immigration Network and the Migration Policy Institute co-hosted the conference in the Georgetown University Law Center Hart Auditorium on Oct. 29.
“We must account for these people. They are not going away in a Democratic or a Republican administration,” Johnson said. “We want to encourage them to come forward, submit to a background check and if eligible, to get on the books. And to those of us who say we do not have the authority to do this without a change in law, then I say it’s time to change the law.”
Panels on issues of immigration in American politics, specifically focusing on the 2016 presidential election and unaccompanied children detained on the U.S.-Mexico border, followed the speeches.
Panelists came from immigration advocacy groups and government immigration departments, and also included legal scholars.
The panel discussions included “Today’s Politics and U.S. Immigration Policy,” “Exploring the Future of Executive Action,” “Unaccompanied Central American Children: One Year Later” and “Examining the Growth of Immigrant Detention and the Future of Detention Alternatives.”
Migration Policy Institute Director of Communications and Public Affairs Michelle Mittelstadt highlighted the growth of the conference since its first year, and addressed the most timely issues in the sphere of immigration.
“We feel that immigration is a subject both in policy and politics that is often misunderstood,” Mittelstadt said. “The conference takes its shape annually from not only what has been the top policy discussions that have taken place but also what are likely to be the top policy discussions in the year ahead. I think the conference was reflective of where the country and where the debate is right now.”
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres delivered the other keynote address of the day. He focused on the humanitarian aspects of the European refugee crisis, highlighting the situation’s social and moral costs.
“The humanitarian response capacity of the world is no longer enough to be able to provide the minimum levels of core protection and the minimum levels of lifesaving assistance to the people,” Guterres said.
Director of the Institute for the Study of International Migration Susan Martin said that Guterres’ speech gave an honest depiction of the global refugee crisis.
“The high commissioner gave an excellent lecture that really captured what’s happening today with regards to refugees and displaced persons,” Martin said. “I thought he was very frank and wasn’t pulling any punches in talking about what are some of the constraints facing the problems in working globally on refugee issues.”
Mittelstadt also expressed the belief that the panels were thought-provoking but pessimistic about the U.S. government’s reaction to immigration issues.
“Some of the biggest takeaways were that there’s little expectation that Congress and this administration or a new administration are going to quickly turn to immigration legislation,” Mittelstadt said. “I think that the discussion coming out of a couple of the panels made clear that there’s nothing that currently suggests that there’s the political space for the parties to come together and do something in Congress.”

The McDonough School of Business’ full time MBA program fell two spots to 26th in the country while its part-time MBA program surged 34 spots to fourth in the country, according to Bloomberg Businessweek’s business school rankings released in October.
The drop and rise of the full and part-time programs, respectively, can be attributed to a new rankings methodology. The criteria now includes a survey of former MBA students who are six to eight years removed from graduation.
Jonathan Rodkin, Bloomberg Businessweek rankings and research coordinator, explained that the new methodology behind the rankings was a result of a multi-year reevaluation of past criteria. The former model placed greater emphasis on components of the school itself, such as faculty or test scores, whereas the new rankings reflect graduate employment success post-graduation. The new methodology will be used for the foreseeable future, Rodkin said.
“The last couple years have featured a top-to-bottom evaluation and rethinking of the rankings methodology,” Rodkin said. “In the future, we don’t anticipate big changes like this.”
There are five components to the rankings methodology. Three areas incorporate data collected from surveys with seniors about to graduate, alumni who graduated six to eight years ago and companies likely to hire MBA program graduates. The other two categories are job-placement rates, which measure how likely a graduate will find work, and salary information.
Rodkin explained that the new rankings seek to reflect how well a business school’s MBA programs create career opportunities for its graduates. Bloomberg added an alumni component to evaluate how graduates thought their education had helped them.
“We can track [alumni] career progression over time,” Rodkin said. “[Bloomberg asked about] their program in how it helped increase their earning potential and how it helped them prepare for various aspects of their working life.”
Prashant Malaviya, senior associate dean for MBA programs, said the higher ranking for the part-time MBA program can be directly attributed to alumni satisfaction. The MSB’s part time MBA program was ranked second in the country for graduate satisfaction with their current work, according to Bloomberg’s list.
Specifically, Malaviya cited the MBA Evening Program as successful among alumni. The MBA Evening Program course is taught over 34 months for a total of 60 credit hours, with classes offered two evenings a week Monday through Thursday.
While the drop of two places for the full-time MBA program was a disappointment, Malaviya cited recent trends in the full- time program, such as recruitment of students with greater diversity and experience, as reasons to expect a future increase in ranking.
Malaviya noted that the MSB completely renovated its full time MBA program in 2012, aiming to offer a more inclusive and global experience. Malaviya predicted that Georgetown’s ranking might improve with time after more graduates who are beneficiaries of this updated program reach the market.
“Georgetown’s MBA programs are in a cycle of continuous improvement,” Malaviya wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As the world changes, so does the way we do business. So, we strive to improve our program every year.”
In an article announcing the rankings, Rodkin and Business Education Editor Francesca Levy explained that the measures are particularly relevant due to high interest in receiving MBAs.
Rodkin and Levy cited the new methodology as key to aid applicants in choosing business schools.
“More graduate degrees in business are awarded each year than in any other field in the U.S.,” Rodkin and Levy wrote. “New business schools are accredited by the dozen every year. [We need to] identify the best ones.”
Among similar rankings, the U.S. News and World Report ranks the MSB’s full-time program 24th in the country while its part time program is tied for 13th.
