A student-led vigil and a panel discussion between university scholars this week spurred reflection and action on Georgetown’s campus, two and a half weeks after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.
“It’s been 50 years since Freedom Summer, 50 years since the Civil Rights Act, 50 years since Dr. King won the Nobel Peace Prize, and what we’ve experienced in the past two weeks is a recognition of the unfinished work of this republic, the unfinished work of seeking to realize the American Dream, the unfinished work of the American idea, the unfinished work of the American project,” University President John J. DeGioia said at Tuesday’s vigil. “Two hundred and thirty-eight years later we recognize that the work of this republic is unfinished.”
The Black Leadership Forum organized the vigil, which included comments by assistant professor of history Marcia Chatelain, who has been organizing online discussions about how to teach students about Ferguson through the hashtag #FergusonSyllabus, associate professor of history and African-American studies Maurice Jackson, Rev. Raymond Kemp, DeGioia and various student speakers.
“I look here and I see what is wrong with America, but you young people — you are going to save the future of America,” Jackson said at the vigil, reflecting on solutions to white privilege and police militarization.
Continuing the conversation on Thursday evening in Gaston Hall, Provost Robert Groves moderated a panel discussion with university-affiliated scholars including Chatelain, Jackson, sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson, government professor Douglas Reed and Georgetown University Law Center professors Paul Butler and Peter Edelman.
Groves began the forum by acknowledging the emotional gravity of the situation.
“In Ferguson, we’ve all seen video images that shocked us, another life cut down, never to fulfill its promise,” Groves said.“And so it’s understandable that our first responses are emotional. As we continue to reflect, we must engage new ideas and perspectives that deepen our understanding. So it is important, I think, that we bring to bear at this moment, at this time all the knowledge and wisdom of those who devoted their lives to the study of race and intergroup relations.”
Butler continued the discussion by explaining the laws and structures that give power to police departments in America. He referenced Section 1033 of the National Defense Authorization Act, which provides police departments with surplus military equipment, such as grenade launchers and tanks, for free.
“When these departments get this equipment, they have to use it within the year, otherwise they have to give it back to the Pentagon. So think of the perverse incentives that provides the police,” Butler said, stating that the American people also have legal protections including the right to film the police and the right to protest.
Chatelain commented on the national impact of Brown’s death, citing the persistence of Ferguson protestors.
“We no longer think of social unrest as a problem of sociologists but as a problem of all engaged people,” Chatelain said. “You’re seeing this from an interdisciplinary lens. This isn’t just an economic problem and this is just not a problem from lawyers, but it’s a problem for all of us.”
Stating that poverty and racism drive tragedies like Brown’s death, Dyson said that there are excruciating conflicts in cities like Ferguson between residents and people like police officers who occupy social and urban spaces.
“The problem with the police is when they show up, they often can’t make a distinction between who was the ostensible criminal and the criminalized black person. That’s because there’s a preconception of what black people are likely to do,” Dyson said. “The criminalization of black people is a devastating consequence of four centuries of rejection and repudiation of the humanity of black people. What we saw there was the inability to see a black person as a human being.”
Butler and Dyson expressed disappointment in President Barack Obama’s lack of commitment to racial justice, stating that politicians need to lead national change and that programs like education initiative My Brother’s Keeper are inefficient and misguided.
“We need to make our leaders more accountable for race, starting with President Obama. When he was elected …there was measured optimism that he would make racial justice part of his platform and he has not. Now, when he reluctantly talks about race it seems more like he’s explaining to white people how black people feel. We need less translation and more real leadership,” Butler said. “Barack Obama is a brilliant man and if he uses his last two years of presidency to focus on racial and economic inequality, what a wonderful legacy that would be.”
Reed recommended changes at the university level, noting the absence of students and professors of color in Georgetown’s classrooms.
“The university does two things primarily — research and teaching — and if we’re really going to be serious about this we need to invest in the programs and the capacity of the faculty to do research on this. In American government, my department, we don’t have someone who teaches on race,” Reed said. “That absence leads to an absence of knowledge at the university that has consequences.”
Students, who filled Red Square for the vigil and packed Gaston Hall for the panel, expressed support for university and student efforts.
“Anything like this is important, just like the Trayvon Martin case. We want to shed light on any injustice at Georgetown, as the type of school that we are and the importance we have to the country,” Jabril Trawick (COL ’15), who attended the vigil, said. “I think that our doing this helps open our eyes toward justice. This is important because it influences other people; it influences other universities. It’s great to be a leader in something like this.”

And so now we are to define kangaroo courts as vigils” and “panel discussions?” But of course: where else but at Georgetown and Through The Looking Glass.

Although non-student employees at Georgetown have so far been unaffected by this summer’s minimum wage increase from $8.25 to $9.50 in Washington D.C., as they currently earn more than the new wage rate, some Georgetown employees still fear the potential threat of lay-offs and reduced hours as the minimum approaches $11.50 in 2016.
Tiffany McGriff, a cashier at O’Donovan Hall, currently earns a salary exceeding the $11.50 minimum wage. However, she expressed her fear that the future hikes could cause budget cuts that might limit her hours, which currently stand at 37.
“It’ll probably affect me but it hasn’t affected me now. Probably next year it might affect me but I hope it doesn’t,” McGriff said. “Because right now I’m not looking forward to budget cuts; I can’t afford budget cuts. But my hours have been good.”
McGriff particularly pointed to higher-salaried workers, who she believed would see their hours furloughed to offset the increased costs.
“I think they’re going to furlough the ones that are actually making more money,” she said. “Now for the ones that are making minimum wage, they’re going to give them roughly no more than 35 hours. They’re not going to get 40.”
However, despite her fears, she supported the minimum wage increase as a basic necessity. She gave the example of her daughter, a 2010 Strayer University graduate with a degree in business administration, currently working at a job in security and a second job at Safeway.
“You can’t make a living off $9.50. Especially if you’re working five, six hours, sometimes you might get seven or eight hours. So it’s not livable. You can’t live off that,” she said. “My daughter was like, ‘I went to college for nothing, because I can’t find anything in my field.’”
Fernandez McPherson, a utility worker at Leo’s, saw an increase in his wages when he came to Georgetown and was pleased that other workers in the District will see a similar increase.
“I started off, it was $5.25, then it was $7.25, $7.55, then $8.25. Then I came here and it was $11.60,” McPherson said. “So that had a major impact on me … I get a raise every six months.”
Aramark, which operates the dining hall, could not be reached for comment.
Since many Georgetown employees already earn more than $11.50, some employees hope that they will see proportionate raises in their salary as the District’s minimum wage increases.
“When I first started they started us off at $12, so that feels like our minimum wage. So if they increase it, it would be nice for them to increase ours as well,” said an AlliedBarton dormitory security guard, who wished to remain anonymous. “Since we’re already above what they’re increasing it to, I don’t think they would. But it would be nice for them to at least push it up a notch.”
Those opposed to raising the minimum wage argue that prices of goods will automatically skyrocket to offset the cost of paying workers more, forcing the D.C. wage to be indexed to local inflation.
However, Georgetown University Bookstore Director Janet Uzzell said that the bookstore would not likely raise prices as bookstore prices would not be affected by a higher wage.
“Prices for goods that we sell are predetermined,” Uzzell said. “I think in some cases there would be a need [to raise prices], but I think the associates appreciate that they’re making a better wage. Wages aren’t always tied into better associates, but I think it does contribute.”
While Uzzell said that the Follett Corporation, the management provider for the bookstore, would have to raise wages for some of their associates, she maintained that the added pay would not significantly affect the bookstore’s budget.
“Does it eat into the budget?” she said.”Yes. But I think we have a better associate working, so a better associate means a better customer experience. And that means better sales, so it offsets each other. But it doesn’t mean that we automatically raise prices to cover wages.”
The increase will affect student employees, who do earn minimum wage in many jobs.

Ambassador Barbara Bodine joined the School of Foreign Service as the director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy on July 1. The former ambassador to Yemen left the United States Foreign Service after a 33-year career, which included a stint as administrator of the Baghdad area in 2003. Bodine revealed her plans for a resurgent ISD and reflected on her eventful career as a diplomat in the Middle East.
What drew you to Georgetown specifically? You’ve been a resident at several universities and had a long career in the Foreign Service, but why Georgetown, and why the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy?
It’s a world-class university. I’ve worked with the institute off and on for a very long time now with several of the previous directors. I’ve always been an admirer of the institute. And to be honest when somebody told me that this directorship was coming open, I got my application in as fast as I possibly could. The mission of the institute is something I deeply believe in and to be associated with this university? Absolutely.
What exactly do you envision the role of the ISD to be? How would you characterize the institute’s role in the past few years and do you see it moving in a different direction?
I think rather than talking retrospectively I’d like to talk prospectively. The two operative parts of the title are “study of” and “diplomacy.” The short version is, my first goal is to reweave the institute into the School of Foreign Service and into Georgetown University. I do think over the last couple years it went further and further away. Most students didn’t know it existed, a lot of faculty didn’t know it existed, and to the extent that people knew it existed, they didn’t know what it did. So, to bring its profile back, how do you do that?
I want to do some working groups on ongoing major issues and one that we’ve talked about … is doing something like, “How do you manage Putin’s Russia?”
What brings you to academia after having a very active role in the Foreign Service, in policy and practice?
As opposed to going to work for a defense contractor and making a lot of money? I think, first of all, I still love the policy world and policy issues, and if you can’t do it in the government, being at a school of public policy where everyone else is as interested in the same things as you are is a great environment. I truly enjoy working with students. … I had a terrific career. It’s time for somebody else to go off and have that career and if I can share some lessons and insights and help the way that people helped me when I was a junior officer, that’s terrific. There’s a little bit of handing the torch off.
Could you tell me a little bit about your career in the Foreign Service?
On one level, I didn’t know what I was getting into. I’m from southern California and I didn’t have a lot of experience with the world of diplomacy. So I liked the idea of diplomacy, I liked the idea of the Foreign Service, but I didn’t know what it was. I did know that I liked policy, I liked international policy, I didn’t want to be an observer to it. At the end of the day, the decisions are made in the government. That’s where it actually happens. Influence, information analysis systems, all of the stuff coming from everybody else, absolutely. But the actual decision — I wanted to be a part of that. I wanted to make a difference. I ended up with a life and a career that was so much better, so much more fun, so much more meaningful than I could ever have imagined.
You were in Iraq or Kuwait during the Gulf War, right?
In the Gulf War I was in Kuwait when the Iraqis invaded. I was a hostage for five months. The U.S. government was able to negotiate with the Iraqi government for all the dependents and nonessential personnel to leave Kuwait and Iraq and go home. But we had 3,000 Americans trapped in the city and so the ambassador and I said, “We’re not going to leave.”
We weren’t quite sure what we were going to be able to do but we felt it was immoral to get out, so we stayed. The Iraqis were not happy so they locked us in our embassy compound and cut off the water, food, electricity, plumbing and everything else. We spent five months that way. But we got every single American out.
We had a palate of tuna fish. For five months, I had tuna fish for lunch and for dinner every day for 137 days.
I have not eaten tuna fish since. My cats do not get tuna flavored treats. I have a tuna-free home. Even today I just can’t do it.
You were in Kuwait during the invasion and were ambassador to Yemen around the USS Cole bombing and also you administrated the Baghdad area in 2003. Those were under three different presidents, three different policies and different parties. The Foreign Service is supposed to be apolitical, so how do you balance all those different situations?
I was also in Baghdad during the Iran-Iraq War. I think the Foreign Service is apolitical. When you become a Foreign Service officer, you take an oath of office which is actually the same one the president takes. You take your oath of office to uphold the Constitution. You’re not taking an oath to the president, or to a party, you’re taking an oath, as someone explained to me, to “we the people” and your job is to serve the national interest. … There are still these broader national security goals, but if I go in and I am the representative of the U.S. government, the people I’m talking to don’t really care what Barbara Bodine’s views are. They want to know what the U.S. government policy is, and that’s what you’re representing, and that’s also what you’re trying to further sometimes by being very candid back to Washington.
Because you administrated in Iraq in 2003, what do you predict will happen in the near future and do you have any policy prescriptions?
Iraq is going to be with us for a very long time. … I don’t think anyone wants it to divide. I do agree with those that say the primary problem is a political one and I would say that in addition to the very real question about invading in the first place, how many troops we invaded with, did we have enough troops to stabilize the country? No. Did we have a plan for the day after? No. Did we make some fundamental mistakes like sectarianizing the government? Yes. So a lot of these go back to 2003.
The other issue is a political-diplomatic issue that Maliki was not held, I think, strenuously enough to create an inclusive and representative government, and he became increasingly sectarianized, increasingly despotic to the point where when ISIS came in, they were leaning on an open door.
You were also very intent on advancing women’s education and other rights, what do you foresee in that?
The status and role of women in the Middle East has always been better than portrayed here, and it’s also been getting better. Has it reached some sort of nirvana? No, and neither have we. When we have this thing down perfect, I will be far more judgmental about other people, but we have a long way to go, too. Women today are remarkably better educated than their mothers, certainly their grandmothers. They’re much more involved in working outside the home than the home, they have a far greater political role than before. It has changed fundamentally. Is there going to be pushback? Absolutely. … There’s a long way to go, but it’s gone much further than we give them credit for. The fact that women were so visible in the Arab Spring is actually a reflection of changes that started 20 years ago. These were the daughters of the women who had first pushed through, who thought “I have a perfect right to be on the frontlines of the Arab Spring.”
I’m always cautious, but I’m generally optimistic.
Did you experience pushback being a woman in such a high position in the Middle East?
No. I think it’s been overblown very badly. I ended up spending over 30 years in the Middle East. I would not have done that if I wasn’t effective, and I didn’t enjoy it. The fact is that the Middle East bureau for decades had the highest percentage of women officers in every single embassy.
Do you plan on staying at the ISD for a while?
That’s a question for the dean. I plan on staying for a while. I took my last job for a year, and I ended up staying for seven. I joined the Foreign Service for 10 and stayed for 33.

In a move signifying some progress in university policy toward transgender students, the university has placed a transgender student in housing with other students of the same gender, amid ongoing conversations about changing housing and registrar policies that affect transgender students.
Since meeting with university officials for the first time last April to discuss transgender issues, student LGBTQ activists have addressed an array of topics, including the representation of transgender students’ preferred names on their GOCards.
Celeste Chisholm (COL ’15), a former trans* representative for GU Pride, said that when she returned to campus this fall after studying abroad last spring, the changes in the university’s responses to transgender students felt sudden.
“I’ve actually seen more of a sharp change,” Chisholm said. “For one thing, I used to be housed in the basement of Copley Hall by myself in the handicapped room that was obviously meant for wild cards, and my junior year I was housed in McCarthy Hall in the boys’ section. But this year they actually housed me with three other girls in Village B. It’s great. It’s wonderful and nobody cares.”
In the past, Georgetown’s policy has been to house transgender students with students of the gender they present as “full time,” although “full time” was not always clearly defined, according to transgender students. This is related to Georgetown’s policy to not recognize non-binary genders, which Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson expressed last year, spurring some negative student reaction.
Chisholm’s housing fits with the “full time” policy. Lexi Dever (COL ’16), the current GU Pride trans* representative, said she is living in a single in Copley Hall, and not the basement room Chisholm was given a few years ago.
Gender-neutral housing, which would allow students to live with roommates of any gender, has been a point of student advocacy and a focus of some Georgetown University Student Association candidates’ platforms in the past few years, to limited avail. During last year’s GUSA vice presidential debate, all candidates said their tickets would support gender-neutral housing.
Dever said the presence of openly transgender students on campus has helped to advance these policies.
“Right now we have four or five openly transgender students at Georgetown for the first time,” Dever said. “We have actual students fighting for their actual rights. This is simultaneously getting more things done and building awareness among the whole community.”
One issue that student activists are also discussing with administrators is how GOCards identify transgender students. Many transgender students are called by something other than their legal name, and their preferred names are oftentimes placed in parentheses or quotation marks on the ID cards.
“I still have those parentheses, and it’s terrible. It’s uncomfortable because you are basically outing yourself to everyone you interact with,” Chisholm said. “These aren’t nicknames of ours. They are the names that we go by every day. It’s a real name.”
Student advocates and the University Registrar are working to expand this policy for now so that all students who regularly identify with a name other than their legal name can have their preferred name included on their GOCards in quotes or parentheses in order to prevent transgender students from being singled out.
Currently, students have to go through LGBTQ Resource Center Director Shiva Subbaraman, who then contacts the University Registrar, in order to add acknowledgement of their preferred names on their GoCards.
“We are hoping to make it so that it doesn’t have to always be Shiva. It could be a chaplain, a professor or any university member who can advocate for the student to say that their preferred name is something they are really serious about,” Dever said.
In response to these concerns, the University Registrar is working toward being more inclusive and accommodating to the needs of transgender students at Georgetown.
“Whatever we decide to do would have to accommodate the needs of individual students for privacy and flexibility around a very emotional issue and at the same time allow the university to have accurate academic records, but I don’t see any reason why we can’t find a way to accommodate both of those imperatives,” University Registrar and Assistant Provost John Q. Pierce said.
The most significant change, however, has been in the overall culture at Georgetown.
“Our students are at heart very understanding people,” Chisholm said. “The biggest change I’ve seen is the culture surrounding these issues and how the bureaucracy of Georgetown is allowing for students to make these interactions with trans students, and I think that’s the most important part.”
This year’s New Student Orientation included a conversation about gender and gender identity during training for orientation advisors.
“As an OA, we did spend some time during training discussing the topic of the gender pronouns that our new students might identify with. There was a concern among staff that we weren’t creating a welcoming enough environment for transgender students,” Orientation Adviser Alexandra Smith (COL ’17) said. “I’m proud to be at a place where we can have these discussions, but there’s a long way to go before that’s an integrated and central part of all university policy.”
Both university officials and student activists within the LGBTQ community plan on continuing these conversations throughout the semester to make Georgetown a safer and more accepting place for transgender students.
“I’m not sure if we agreed to a clear solution yet, but I know that there is a clear solution,” Chisholm said.

First-time violations of some Code of Student Conduct regulations that occur during freshman year will no longer be visible to employers and graduate schools on a student’s disciplinary record, after changes to the code implemented this summer that the Office of Student Conduct is expected to announce today.
A first-time violation of certain noise and alcohol policies will be kept as an internal record, rather than a disciplinary record, provided that the student completes sanctions and has no additional conduct violations over the rest of his or her time at Georgetown, the university will announce today, according to Georgetown University Student Association President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15).
“This policy addresses students who may have had a lapse in judgment and/or decision-making during their first-year [sic] of college,” reads the revised code of conduct, which is already available online. “It encourages students to take responsibility for their decision-making by giving tangible benefits to those students who learn from their mistakes and demonstrate better decision-making throughout the remainder of their Georgetown career.”
While the Office of Student Conduct may disclose requested information from a student’s disciplinary record with potential employers or graduate schools, provided that the university receives written consent from the student, information from a student’s internal record will not be shared with anyone outside of the university.
“Now, essentially, if you get a first-time alcohol violation as a freshman and you don’t receive an additional violation, that won’t appear on your record. It will be maintained internally by the university,” Tezel said.
Upon completion of sanctions, the violation will be transferred from the student’s disciplinary record to the university’s internal records. The first violation will, however, reappear on the student’s disciplinary record if the student commits any further conduct code violations.
This policy applies to on-campus noise violations and on-campus alcohol violations, including possession or consumption of alcohol and the possession or use of alcohol-related paraphernalia, and does not extend to transfer students during their first year at Georgetown.
If a freshman commits multiple infractions  during the same incident, all of the violations from that incident will be removed from the student’s disciplinary record in compliance with the new policy.
Students are typically required to complete an educational requirement, pay a fine, undergo housing probation or complete work sanction hours as a penalty for such violations.
“The new policy reflects a movement that the Office of Student Conduct has made in the past year or two toward educationally based assignments in order to assess learning from past violations,” Tezel said.
In addition to the first-year record policy, the Office of Student Conduct created a provision to the Code of Student Conduct stating that students of any year will no longer receive fines from the Office of Student Conduct for their first trash or property maintenance violation.
Students are usually fined by the D.C. Department of Public Works in addition to the Office of Student Conduct for trash violations.
“We were advocating on the behalf of eliminating the fine because it was kind of a common sense idea that the residents are already being fined by the city for this and it’s unfair for the students to receive an additional fine for a trash violation,” Tezel said.
Work sanctions and educational assignments will still be issued as penalties for first-time trash and property maintenance violations.

Georgetown will welcome its first Hindu chaplain, army captain and chaplain Pratima Dharm, in October. After Dharm retires from active duty, she will begin working part time with students, professors and the Office of Mission and Ministry.
Dharm currently serves as the first Hindu chaplain in the U.S. Army and has worked at army bases and hospitals around the world for eight years, including a yearlong deployment in Iraq. She is the head conflict resolution/resiliency and suicide prevention chaplain at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
Dharm will join Campus Ministry’s staff of Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Orthodox and Protestant chaplains.
According to Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., a group of students and administrators helped select the new chaplain from a competitive pool.
“We’ve been looking for a Hindu chaplain for a couple of years now, and we’ve been talking with students about identifying a Hindu chaplain and the type of chaplain they want,” O’Brien said. “It was a competitive open search, but she was identified because of our contacts with the local Hindu community.”
The selection committee included three of the past presidents of the Hindu Student Association, including current president, Smiti Mohan (MSB ’15) and former president Ronak Parikh (MSB ’12). According to Mohan, the administration strongly valued student input during the decision-making process.
“We are the individuals with the most working knowledge about the process, the needs of the Hindu community and what the role of a Hindu chaplain would look like at Georgetown,” Mohan wrote in an email. “However, HSA boards have been discussing the hiring of a chaplain since my freshman year. It was very exciting and we were thrilled that Campus Ministry valued and placed such an emphasis on including our student feedback in their decision process.”
O’Brien said that Dharm is the best candidate for the job because of her multicultural and multi-religious background.
“She brings a unique mix of religious sensitivities to the position. She is a woman steeped in her own Hindu tradition, yet she has also been engaged deeply with other religious traditions, first as an Army chaplain, which serves all traditions,” O’Brien said. “She has had deep engagement with Christians and Muslims and Jews, so she brings a really unique set of experiences, which makes her sensitive to our interfaith engagement on campus.”
As a chaplain, Dharm will provide counseling, Hindu worship services and blessings to any member of the Georgetown community who seeks her guidance.
“[I will] help the students understand and be in touch with their faith traditions and their culture,” Dharm said.“The Indian culture and Hindu culture is very deep and very ancient, and to be able to have some continuity, even on a campus, is very important.”
Dharm said that her experience with young people in the army has prepared her well for helping students with the stresses they face on college campuses.
“On active duty, the actual population that we take care of and administer to are the young soldiers. The issues are pretty much the same,” Dharm said.“There are issues of identity that we deal with and issues of suicide, which is very rampant in the Army. … There’s a lot of stress related to starting a new career in the army, and here too, with the academics. … [We are] bringing them the grace of God, the aspect of faith and the aspect of grace in all of our counseling and guidance.”
Mohan said Dharm will provide the HSA with a figurehead and role model in the years to come.
“I’m very excited for the HSA community to have a mentor and role model,” Mohan wrote.“I’m also excited to increase the awareness and presence of Hinduism on campus as the number of Hindu students grows exponentially each year.”
As the first Hindu chaplain, Dharm will add a new facet of religious diversity on campus, O’Brien said.
“From its founding, Georgetown has committed itself to service of students of different faith traditions,” O’Brien said. “We are proud of our Catholic heritage, but to be Catholic in the world today is also to engage in substantial interreligious dialogue, and our hiring a Hindu chaplain to serve on our staff reflects this age old commitment to the service of students of all faiths and to interreligious dialogue.”
Dharm said she is pleased to help the university on its way to a more diverse and culturally eclectic community.
“It is very important to note that Georgetown has a tradition of diversity and celebrating diversity, and I think that this is a step forward in that,” Dharm said. “You couldn’t go more into diversity, you have to always only step forward. Each step that we take is a lesson for us all as a community. There will be many more steps that I am confident Georgetown will take.”

Georgetown University Fossil Free, a student campaign group focused on petitioning the university to divest its endowment from fossil fuel companies, has released its completed 35-page proposal. The group of about 10 students has worked on the proposal for over a year with the university’s Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, professors and administrators.
According to GU Fossil Free’s media contact, Chloe Lazarus (COL ’16), the campaign hopes that CISR will approve the proposal, which can then be presented to Georgetown’s board of directors for final approval.
“We’re asking Georgetown to divest its investment in fossil fuel companies,” Lazarus said. “We’ve been working with the CISR for that amount of time as well, and they’ve been giving us tips and suggestions on how to approach this so that the board will agree to it. We’re asking them to divest from fossil fuel companies and reinvest in socially responsible companies, and we hope this includes renewable energy companies.”
In the proposal, GU Fossil Free employs thorough research and comprehensive sourcing to outline why the university should divest from fossil fuels. According to Lazarus, divestment is a moral necessity, a financial benefit and a political tactic.
“The carbon bubble is going to burst soon, and it’s actually financially better for Georgetown to switch its investments to longer-lasting companies, rather than companies that are about to crash,” she said. “We also have such a pull with the political spectrum but also with this religious spectrum and we kind of have to use our place here to promote these kinds of things that aren’t really being focused on.”
In order to develop the proposal, GU Fossil Free enlisted the CISR for help with more technical investment terms.
“CISR has been pretty important and helpful for us being able to understand how to approach this proposal,” Lazarus said. “We don’t have a lot of professional experience with investments and so we really are thankful for CISR’s contributions on what to approach, how to approach it, how best to express that desire, but at the same time, GU Fossil Free would like to make our proposal our own.”
The Georgetown University Student Association has publicly supported GU Fossil Free’s proposal and divestment from fossil fuels since November 2013. GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said he fully supports GU Fossil Free’s mission.
“I was able to read through the proposal, and I was incredibly impressed and won over by the objectives of the group,” Tezel said. “I had been previously, but any doubts in my mind that Georgetown should divest from fossil fuels were put to rest with that report. …  In my opinion, when the time is right, I am hoping that senior university officials will take the conversation of divestment seriously and that that conversation will happen on every level, from the committee on investments of social responsibility all the way up to the university board of directors.”
If GU Fossil Free’s proposal is accepted by the board, Georgetown will join the 13 universities, including Stanford University, currently in the process of divestment from fossil fuel companies.
According to GU Fossil Free’s recent press release, GU Fossil Free hopes to see Georgetown become the first Jesuit university with an endowment exceeding $1 billion to divest from fossil fuels.
“Through divestment, Georgetown can make a strong statement… and reassert itself as a leader among our peer institutions,” Tezel said in a press release.
 
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that GU Fossil Free suggested specific companies to the university for reinvestment. GU Fossil Free is a divestment campaign, not a reinvestment campaign, and does not suggest specific companies for reinvestment to the university.

Uber, the app-based transportation company, dropped its rates for the discounted uberX service while raising prices for the signature UberBLACK cars, effective Aug. 18.
Originally Uber’s only service, this high-end town car service now charges a minimum of $15, with a $7 base fare that adds $3.40 per mile traveled in the vehicle, approximately a 7 percent increase on previous rates. The cancellation fee also doubled from $5 to $10.
“As UberBLACK is our premium rider experience, we are continually striving to have it be recognized as the go-to luxury ride in D.C.,” Uber spokesperson Kaitlin Durkosh wrote. “The goal of the initiative is higher earnings for partners and higher quality for riders.”
The service also permanently cut its uberX prices by 15 percent this month, making it 30 percent cheaper than a local taxi, according to Durkosh.
Durkosh stressed the importance of having a variety of transportation options for any person’s budget.
“Riders really love having multiple options available via the Uber platform and at various price points,” she wrote in an email.
UberX, Uber’s most popular service in D.C., has a consumer base of mostly young people under the age of 40 looking for inexpensive transportation, making the ride-sharing service a popular option among Georgetown students.
“I did notice the price change when I took uberX last week, and it will probably make me more likely to take it because uberX or taxi is all I use anyway,” Sohum Patel (MSB ‘17) said.
Audrey Fangmeyer (NHS ’17), however, said that while she noticed the price cut, she did not see herself using uberX more because of it.
“I noticed the change, got an email from Uber and 15 percent is a significant price cut, but as it is I don’t use Uber or uberX very often, so I don’t see the change affecting me,” she said.
She pointed to the popularity of the uberX service as an affordable alternative to the pricier town cars. The cheaper option began serving the D.C. area in August 2013 and features hybrid and mid-range cars.
Because of the presence of other available cheaper options, students were unconcerned by the price hike.
“I don’t really use the town cars, and uberX is cheaper anyway, so the price changes wouldn’t really affect me,” Aaron Wen (SFS ’17) said.
Founded in San Francisco in March 2009 by Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp, Uber, along with other unregulated ride-sharing companies, has recently come under fire for offering inadequate insurance to its riders, incomplete background checks on drivers and minimal driver training and vehicle inspection.
The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles issued a cease-and-desist letter to both Uber and Lyft, another ride-sharing company, on June 5. While D.C. Taxicab Commission spokesperson Neville Waters (GRD ’91) said that no such plans are underway in the District, the DCTC has proposed regulations on Uber’s service, including a proposal in April to limit the hours of Uber drivers without a taxi license, mandate background checks and require insurance provided by the company.
Despite the various regulation battles, Waters said that the DCTC has not changed its rates since the rise of Uber and that the commission was uninvolved in the rates set by the company.
“We don’t engage in regulating in any digital dispatch rates,” Waters said. “It’s a competitive marketplace.”
Waters stressed the need for more regulations on these ride-sharing companies, specifically the need for an inventory of drivers to keep better tabs on the companies,
“We’re hopeful that we’re going to a resolution soon once the city council is back in session that will allow us to enforce against illegal street hails,” he said.”These digital dispatch services—their vehicles should not engage in street hails. They can be booked by electronic purposes, and you know, to help enforce against the hails, we want to have an inventory of who’s driving for these companies.”

After the highly contested merger of the Corcoran Gallery of Art with both the The George Washington University and the National Gallery of Art was approved by a D.C. Superior Court judge, admission to the Corcoran will be free of charge for the first time in 145 years.
Formerly the oldest independent private art gallery in the District, the Corcoran has struggled financially in recent years. The gallery ran deficits in 11 of its last 13 years, finishing its fiscal year last year with a deficit of $5.5 million in 2013 and with $9.2 million in 2012. In 2011, the gallery experienced a seven-year low of just 85,000 visitors, finishing that fiscal year with a $7.2 million deficit.
The museum announced its proposal to merge with GWU in February of this year, prompting initial backlash from certain members of the art community, including students, faculty and staff of the Corcoran, among others, who hoped to preserve founder William Corcoran’s original vision of an independently run art gallery.
After battling it out in court, Judge Robert Okun ruled Aug. 18 that it would be “impracticable” for the Corcoran Gallery to continue running as usual.
“This court finds it painful to issue an order that effectively dissolves the Corcoran as an independent entity,” Okun wrote in his 149-page decision.”But this court would find it even more painful to deny the relief requested and allow the Corcoran to face its likely demise — the likely dissolution of the college, the closing of the gallery and the dispersal of the gallery’s entire collection.”
The National Gallery of Art will now take control of the Corcoran’s 17,000 pieces of art, of an estimated worth of approximately $2 billion. The National Gallery will eventually keep a portion of the artwork, and the rest will be donated to other museums.
Now under the control of the National Gallery of Art, the Corcoran ceased charging its $10 admission fee on Aug. 22, continuing during the month of September, until the gallery closes Oct. 1 for renovations.
How the Corcoran College will be integrated with GWU has yet to be decided, GWU President Steven Knapp told The Washington Post.
National Gallery of Art publicist Mimi Carter noted that the recent free admission has sparked a rise of visitors to the museum galleries.
“We’ve already seen a three- to five-fold increase in museum attendance at the gallery, and we expect this will continue through the month of September,” Carter said.
She added that the free admission has encouraged a wider demographic of newcomers to the Corcoran.
“I think what’s interesting is that you are just starting to see an increase in all of the demographics — young, old, tourists, locals, lunch-goers — so that’s been exciting,” she said.
Georgetown art professor Elizabeth Prelinger voiced her support for the court’s ruling. “I personally support it very much because the Corcoran had very unfortunate management over the years and has been in a lot of different difficulties, mainly financial ones,” she said. “I think that this will be the best possible solution … both to keep it connected in the art world, but also to keep some semblance of its previous being by having contemporary art from the National Gallery be shown in its rooms.” She acknowledged the case of the Save the Corcoran group, who advocated against the dissolution of the Corcoran’s independence, but said she felt the merger was the best solution to preserve the museum’s artwork for the future.
“It’s difficult when you have a museum, a gallery, that has had such a long history, and you know a single collector who named it … so it is the end of an era, but it’s also the beginning of a new one,” Prelinger said.
Assistant Director of Georgetown’s Art and Museum Studies Program Alana Housholder agreed that the NGA’s much-needed financial support for the Corcoran was a major benefit of the merger.
“The advantage of being connected with the National Gallery is that they have the money to care for the collection, so they can use the right lighting, and the right humidifiers, the right air space, the qualifications that are needed for different kinds of artwork,” Housholder said.
Despite the Corcoran Gallery’s loss of independence, Carter stressed that the agreement will still uphold William Corcoran’s intentions as best as possible by making the artwork more accessible to the public, a value he always upheld.
“I think it’s important to focus on the fact that with the NGA Corcoran building, one of the main goals of the agreement was that the art in the Corcoran collection would be more accessible to the public. And by making the museum free, we are achieving one of the main goals of the historic agreement between the National Gallery of Art and George Washington and Corcoran,” Carter said.

Too bad the Corcoran didn’t come to Georgetown. William Corcoran was a GU alum

Although the university issued a revised speech and expression policy in May, the Georgetown University Student Association and other student organizations are calling for even more extensive access to benefits reform across campus, and clearer communication of the boundaries of new free speech zones.
The revised policy designates spaces such as Regents Lawn, the lobby of the Leavey Center and the Healey Family Student Center as free speech zones for students to table, stage protests and share ideas, but fails to specify the exact locations of zones outside residence halls.
According to GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), the Office of Residential Living has not yet produced a map of acceptable free speech zones, despite multiple requests.
“Somewhat unfortunately, the Office of Residential Living hasn’t gotten back to us on the areas in front of residence halls that students can table,” Tezel said. “The free speech memorandum of understanding was finalized in May and this is something we were trying to work out over the summer. I think the delays can be attributed in part to the shifting construction landscape and the lack of certainty of what areas would be cut off.”
H*yas for Choice President Abby Grace (SFS ’16) said that the organization, which is not recognized by the university, has requested a map multiple times. Without a map, Grace said that she is worried about being removed from Sunday’s Student Activities Fair.
“If we’re confronted by GUPD, we want to have something issued from the university clearly labeled, showing that we’re allowed to be there,” Grace said. “As of today, they still haven’t gotten back to us. … I get that things are busy with construction and move-in and whatnot, but at the same time, if you’re going to say that you’re opening new zones, you can’t just say that they’re there but not provide clear guidelines as to where they are.”
According to Assistant Dean for Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr, student groups without access to benefits can only table in Red Square during the fair, separate from university-affiliated organizations on Copley Lawn. Groups without access to benefits include fraternities and sororities, student businesses, clubs in development periods and campaigns.
“As has been the case every year, individual students or groups without access to benefits can set up in Red Square,” Cohen Derr wrote in an email. “This year in planning for inclement weather the organizers of the SA Fair—the Council of Advisory Boards—has decided to have a rain date instead of a rain location, so in the case of bad weather the SA Fair will move to Sept. 7, and Red Square will continue to be the location for individual students with a viewpoint to express or groups without access to benefits.”
This restricted access to benefits for certain student groups will become a major focus for this year’s GUSA staffers, Tezel said.
“We are about to be engaging the administration on it [access to benefits] in a very serious way,” he said. “What we’re looking to do in some form or another is to ensure that groups like H*yas for Choice, even if they don’t receive funding from the university, still deserve to be able to express themselves as one of many voices that takes place in the campus dialogue.”
GUSA will continue discussions about access to benefits with university administrators, and Tezel said that he hopes to increase access to tabling at the fair, reserving spaces such as Copley Formal Lounge for events, communal storage space and Center for Social Justice van rentals for unrecognized student groups.
“Recognized student organizations should have preference in reserving [Office of Campus Activity Facilities] space, reserving vans and everything else, but especially if we are allowing outside vendors to take advantage of space opportunities at Georgetown, it’s really a shame that we’re not providing that same opportunity to groups of students,” Tezel said.
Grace said that H*yas for Choice will also advocate for access to benefits reform in order to expand free speech on campus.
“There’s still issues with people not being clear on the policy, and I think that what we are going to be demanding this semester is regardless of what a policy says — if its enforcement is not clear, you might as well not have the policy,” Grace said. “We believe that we are here to hold people accountable. We respect that the university does have religious affiliations, but at the same time, we think that the university should respect the innate right of every student to freedom of speech and expression.”
