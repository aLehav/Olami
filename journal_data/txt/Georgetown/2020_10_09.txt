Losing in-person classes has also meant losing the opportunities to bump into strangers walking to class or strolling through Red Square. Searching for those serendipitous connections, four undergraduate students decided to relaunch the Instagram account for Humans of Georgetown. 
Students originally created the account in 2013. Until recently, its most recent post was dated February 2016. So, when Carlos Asorey (SFS ’21) messaged the page asking if anyone was there, Seo Young Lee (COL ’22) thought it was high time to resume the storytelling. 
Humans of Georgetown, based on the 2010 photography project Humans of New York that aimed to photograph 10,000 inhabitants of New York City and has since gained over 20 million followers on social media, photographs Georgetown students, faculty, staff and graduates and catalogs their stories. The project’s earnest, personal focus makes it especially important in an impersonal time, according to Lee.
“It would be such a shame for something like Humans of Georgetown to fade away,” Lee said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Especially now more than ever, there’s no way of casually bumping into someone so we think, we hope, that we can be the platform that proactively reaches out to people to get those spontaneous stories that someone may just scroll past.” 
To reinstate the account, Lee and Asorey assembled a team, including Asorey’s roommate, Neehar Mahidadia (NHS ’21), and Lee’s sister, Yu Young Lee (COL ’24). Since then, Olivia Lebo-Planas (COL ’23) and Phoebe Woonprasert (SFS ’23) have joined the project. 
“What we’re focusing on is trying to create a sense of community while we’re online and so disconnected,” Yu Young said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “We want to get a sense that we are still humans of Georgetown regardless of where we’re all placed.”
Anyone can submit a story or nominate a friend to be featured on the account through a Google form. From there, the account’s organizers reach out for an interview. If a storyteller is on campus, Mahidadia said he and Asorey try to safely connect in person. Otherwise, the team meets online. 
The Humans of Georgetown team strives to make the interviews casual and friendly, Yu Young said in an interview with The Hoya. 
“We want to emphasize that it’s just a conversation about their life, their values, their thoughts, their feelings,” she said. “Anything is valid.”
As of Oct. 8, the account featured three stories from Rabbi Rachel Gartner, Alisha Patel (MSB ’24) and Mark Wilcox (SFS ’21). 
“I won’t lie, the quarantine was tough,” Patel said in a post about living on campus. “But being out and being able to meet all these incredible people from around the country and even around the world has made my time here worthwhile.”
For Mahidadia, the stories shared by Humans of Georgetown resonate as much with the nostalgia felt by seniors with the sense of unfamiliarity some freshman might be experiencing, he said. 
 “There’s a lot that connects the population of Georgetown together that people don’t know yet,” Mahidadia said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. 
The pandemic has radically repurposed the main mission of Humans of Georgetown, which initially set out to be a platform to share spontaneous experiences on campus, according to Yu Young. 
“It’s interesting to have a twist where the stories that we share are very intentional and not as random or organic as they could be,” she said. “Not wrong or bad, but a different kind of storytelling.”
Though Georgetown may be smaller than New York City, there are no fewer stories to share and showcase, according to Mahidadia. 
“Georgetown is a very tightknit and small community, and part of this is to showcase that,” he said. “While we’re all different, we’re all humans of Georgetown.”

Washington, D.C. residents can cast a vote for candidates for two vacant Councilmember At Large seats Nov. 3, as the city prepares safe alternatives to in-person voting. 
This year, 23 at-large candidates are campaigning to fill one of two vacancies on the D.C. Council. Virtual debates held Sept. 29 and 30 provided space for candidates to discuss their platforms and perspectives on topics such as police reform and the current Council budget deficit.
For candidates and voters alike, racial equity and COVID-19 relief take precedence in this election. 
The pandemic has exacerbated previously existing systemic racism, according to Mónica Palacio (LAW ’93), who is hoping to be the first Latina to win an at-large seat. Her priority, if elected, would be funding racial equity programs. 
“I had someone last night ask me, ‘what’s your first priority when you get elected?’” Palacio said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “For me, it would be funding an initiative that has already been passed by the Council, which is the Racial Equity Achieves Results law. That means that we require the government to place a racial equity lens on all our priorities.”
The Racial Equity Achieves Results Act, introduced by Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5), would convene a Racial Equity Working Group to operationalize new racial equity policies and would create racial equity training for District employees. 
Commercial improvements to the District have come at the cost of communities of color, according to Ed Lazere, another candidate in the race for an at-large position. Lazere also aims to put racial justice and equity at the heart of the Council’s agenda. 
“It’s a shame that our prosperity has come at the price of rising homelessness and pushing Black and brown people out of the city,” Lazere said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “As a prosperous and caring city, we can do much better.”  
Facilitating generational wealth by investing more in city programs such as DC Open Doors, which provides down payment assistance to house hunters, and the Home Purchase Assistance Program, which provides loans and financial assistance as well, is a key pillar of candidate Marcus Goodwin’s platform. 
“When I talk about education,” Goodwin said in a phone interview, “I really want to bridge the educational attainment gap between white students and their Black and Latino peers who are graduating and matriculating to college at a much lower rate.”
Comprehensive pandemic recovery is also a major challenge facing the District and the Council, according to Lazere. 
“It’s got to be how do we come out of this pandemic without setting our community and economy any further back than it has to be?” Lazere said. “What do we do to get our children back to school quickly, what do we do to prevent residents from being evicted and what do we do to protect our small businesses?”
Traditional get-out-the-vote efforts have become unsafe, so candidates have taken to social media to canvas voters. Palacio said she has used sites such as Facebook to compensate for the lack of face-to-face interaction.
“I expected to talk to thousands and thousands of people, and it hasn’t been like that at all,” Palacio said. 
To address the pandemic’s ramifications, Lazere has called for a permanent ban on evictions for those who were financially disadvantaged by the pandemic. 
“It would be a public policy and moral failure if we let residents lose their homes because they lost their jobs through no fault of their own,” Lazere said. 
In response to the pandemic, D.C. implemented the Vote Safe DC initiative, to send all registered voters a ballot at their home address without them needing to request one. Voter registration before the Nov. 3 election in D.C. closes on Oct. 13.
Delivering ballots is only half the battle when some residents have never voted by mail, according to Goodwin. 
“People have ballots and don’t know how to use them,” Goodwin said. “That’s a problem, and the drop boxes aren’t ready yet.” 
D.C. opened its mail-in ballot drop boxes Oct. 5, which will be available through 8 p.m. on Election Day. Voters also have the option to vote early in person. These facilities will open Oct. 27 and will close Nov. 2.

Panelists reflected on the common threads between Frederick Douglass’ quest for freedom in the 19th century and the global fight for racial equality in modern times during a virtual event commemorating the 175th anniversary of the activist’s oration tour of Ireland.
Dennis Brownlee, founder and president of the African American Irish Diaspora Network, began the Sept. 29 discussion by introducing the historical framework of Douglass’ travel to Ireland in 1845 and how his 19th-century fight for freedom has parallels to the Black Lives Matter movement today.
The programming, titled “‘Agitate!’—Frederick Douglass and Ireland,” was hosted by the Global Irish Studies initiative at Georgetown and moderated by professor Miriam Nyhan Grey, associate director of Glucksman Ireland House at New York University. Three principal panelists — Howard University professor Edna Greene Medford, Quinnipiac University professor Christine Kinealy and Georgetown University history professor Maurice Jackson — led a conversation highlighting historical and contemporary justice in Ireland and the United States.
Kinealy began the conversation by recounting the context of Douglass’ visit to Ireland. Following the publication of “Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave” and his ensuing fame, Douglass fled to Ireland at the end of 1845 out of fear of capture under the Fugitive Slave Act. Douglass was enthralled and inspired by the freedom, liberation and equality that greeted him in Dublin and decided to extend his stay and study in Ireland, according to Kinealy.
“Within two weeks of being in Ireland, he writes back to Garrison saying that, not only does he for the first time in his life feel safe, but for the first time in his life he feels equal,” Kinealy said. “So being in Ireland becomes a very liberating, transformative experience for the 27-year-old Frederick.”
While the treatment of Irish immigrants diverged greatly from the Black experience in American history, Douglass understood the two communities endured persecution, according to Jackson. Jackson told the gruesome story of when Douglass came across a man covered in a sheet in a ditch with half his face bitten off.
“He found that the man was Irish and he spoke about that. And the white person told him no, you don’t speak about that, you speak about the plantation. You speak about facts, we will give you the philosophy,” Jackson said. “And Douglass says, ‘No, I must fight freedom everywhere.’ And this became a concept that we in America took back, that he saw the struggles of the Irishmen.”
Kinealy said empathy was a cornerstone of Douglass’ legacy because he contested that the fight for equality could be found anywhere and everywhere.
“Oppression was not bound by border or nationality or ethnicity or color or gender,” Kinealy said. “As Frederick Douglass said, ‘Power concedes nothing without a struggle.’ If we just sit back and let it happen, it will happen. We have to be active agents.”
Medford explained that Douglass’ visit to Ireland demonstrated his ability to appeal to people’s shared humanity, making him the champion of human rights of his time.
“Every human being has a responsibility to ensure that every other human being is treated with justice and equality and humanity,” Medford said. “Douglass’s relationship with Irish Americans showed that he understood that we were all in the same place as human beings and that we had to make sure that everyone had the opportunity to live as full a life as possible.” 
Douglass was one of the first to internationalize the plight of Black people and cultivate an ideal of global citizenship that echoes the universal Black Lives Matter movement today, according to Jackson.
“In Minneapolis, and in many cases, everywhere, what you see now is some white kids taking responsibility, taking some initiative. They’ve joined together to fight for Blacks,” Jackson said. “They’re fighting for something that Douglass fought for all his life.”
The Embassy of Ireland, joined by the Council of International Educational Exchange, announced a monetary sponsorship for the fourth cohort of Frederick Douglass Global Fellows for the 2021 year during the event. Ten students of color across the United States will be chosen to attend a study abroad program in Ireland to continue the legacy of agitation for societal change within their own communities.
Simon Coveney, Ireland’s minister of foreign affairs, reflected on the compassion of Douglass and concluded by calling for Ireland to recultivate the tolerance that welcomed Douglass in the first place.
“These past few months have given us pause to reflect on whether all who moved to Ireland today are as welcome as Frederick Douglass was honored 175 years ago,” Coveney said. “We’ve been challenged to acknowledge and address inequalities within the narrow bounds of our own island. And we must continue to strive for equality and liberty, both at home and abroad, in these pursuits.”

This week Georgetown University’s LGBTQ Resource Center kicked off a monthlong schedule of virtual events celebrating Georgetown’s LGBTQ community.
OUTober celebrations began Oct. 7 with a group discussion about family, faith and sexuality. The month’s events, which coincide with LGBTQ history month, include panel discussions, lectures and other programming dedicated to amplifying LGBTQ voices at Georgetown. 
The online programming aims to strengthen student bonds within Georgetown’s LGBTQ community, according to Shiva Subbaraman, the executive director of the LGBTQ Center and the Women’s Center on campus.
“The coming together of all of who we are and who we can be, that is very powerful for the LGBTQ community, because oftentimes, you know, this piece of our identity can be in conflict with the rest of the identities and so to provide a space, to provide opportunities and places where we can be whole people is really important,” Subbarman said in an interview with The Hoya.
OUTober began in 2013 as Coming Out Week. Like in past years, OUTober 2020 will celebrate International Pronouns Day and host a Mass of Belonging alongside Catholic Ministry. Faculty and administrators plan to host discussions about the gay community in Nazi Germany and intersectional family life, among other topics. On Oct. 9, organizers are set to hold a virtual Coming Out Day. This year’s Coming Out Day will look different than in past semesters, when students gathered at Red Square and processed through a decorated closet door amidst a crowd of cheering onlookers. 
Converting OUTober programming online may make it harder for LGBTQ people to build relationships with each other, according to Subbaraman.
“I think the biggest loss I’m feeling is that ability to gather in Red Square,” Subbaraman said. “There is something about, especially for gay, LGBTQ people, our ability to see each other in person and that sort of visceral sense of connection is very, very important, I think, you know, because we, unlike other identities, we can’t tell who each other is, right? Like we can’t recognize each other until we sort of get together.”
Despite these setbacks, the event organizers feel confident students will still be able to commemorate LGBTQ history and pride in a virtual setting. 
Haley Wierzbicki (COL ’21), a student staff member at the LGBTQ Research Center, said she has been attending more than ever before because the events are online. 
“I think people who are maybe totally not sure what OUTober is, or who we at the center, or other groups can come in to zoom and if they want to turn off the camera and just be there from a distance they can do that,” Wierzbicki said.
The LGBTQ Resource Center teamed up with the GU pride, GU Queer People of Color and the Tagliabue Iniative for LGBTQ life to arrange the events. Many of this year’s events, including Coming Out Day, will be held asynchronously, which will allow students to participate when they are available. 
Nikash Harapanahalli (COL ’24), a student involved with GU Pride, feels OUTober’s virtual format makes it more accessible to students, especially those who may be on the fence about attending. 
“I feel safer and more comfortable having all these resources and the fact that I can just easily access them with a click of a finger,” Harapanahalli said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
The event organizers encourage anyone interested to attend as many or as few events as they are comfortable with. OUTober 2020 may prove to be especially important for first-year students who are living at home, Amena Johnson, Assistant Director of the LGBTQ Resource Center, added.
“I imagine that lots of students didn’t expect to be at home — I didn’t expect to be at home. Some freshmen may have been waiting to go to college to come out,” Johnson said in an interview with The Hoya. “And they may be struggling with that. So I think that [OUTober 2020] is definitely something that they should get involved with.”

Four of the nation’s foremost political operatives — all veterans of several congressional fights — convened Wednesday night to discuss the ongoing battle in the Senate over whether to confirm Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett.
The Georgetown Institute for Politics and Public Service discussion featured four political strategists: Democrats Stephanie Cutter and Brian Fallon and Republicans Antonia Ferrier and Ron Bonjean. Cutter advocated for the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland in 2016, while Bonjean was a communications strategist for Justice Neil Gorsuch’s nomination the following year. Ferrier and Fallon have also been intimately involved in previous confirmation battles, with Fallon having previously served as an aide to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Ferrier having served as an aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
The quartet spent the night politely jousting over the future of the Supreme Court and the fate of the seat left vacant by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s passing last month. President Donald Trump announced his intention to appoint Barrett to the seat Sept. 26, with Senate hearings set to begin Oct. 12. Barrett, a federal appellate judge and Notre Dame University law professor with a conservative track record, is expected to shift the balance of the court farther to the political right if confirmed.
While the Democratic strategists Cutter and Fallon shared their party’s plans to delay Barrett’s confirmation, Republican aides Ferrier and Bonjean were unyielding in their determination to push the nominee through, even with the presidential election less than a month away.
“Is this the optimum timing from everyone’s perspective? No. But it’s just the reality of where we are,” Ferrier said. “When you have power and the ability to do it, you do it.”
Fallon, who now leads the judicial reform group Demand Justice, acknowledged that Democrats have little leverage in the fight but said the party would attempt to delay Barrett’s confirmation regardless. 
“Democrats are going to try and pull out all the stops … I think Chuck [Schumer] is going to try and use all of the procedural tactics that are available to him,” Fallon said.
However, Fallon later broke with his party’s leadership to criticize Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), admitting anxiety about whether the octogenarian could successfully combat Barrett during the upcoming confirmation hearings.
“There is a little bit of unrest in the caucus, as well as among the activists, about [Feinstein’s] opening round of questioning,” Fallon said. He expressed his preference for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), the party’s vice presidential nominee, to ask all questions on the Democratic side.
Each of the speakers said they expected Trump and McConnell would be successful in pushing Barrett through, although Bonjean left open the possibility of the confirmation debate getting explosive.
“The Senate is a nitroglycerin right now,” Bonjean said. “Anything can occur.” 
Barrett will need “lots of caffeine and lots of Gatorade” to make it through the process, Bonjean predicted.
For the most part, the event, which featured questions from Georgetown students and GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), focused on what would come after Barrett is presumably confirmed. The panelists were concerned about how Barrett’s nomination might impact the upcoming election.
“Democrats are worked up about it,” Cutter said, expressing hope that the party’s focus on Barrett’s views on the Affordable Care Act could sway voters in November. 
However, Bonjean insisted Trump would benefit from the vacancy, noting that judicial issues tend to animate conservative voters.
“A Supreme Court nomination unites the Republican Party. It’s like the one thing that is the fabric woven in our ideology,” Bonjean said. “Many Republicans who might have thought about voting for Biden will likely vote for Trump because they would like to have another one of Trump’s nominees on the bench.”
Looking even past the 2020 campaign, Fallon predicted that the rush to fill Ginsburg’s seat would push more Democrats to support proposals to pack the Supreme Court, which his organization Demand Justice has ardently advocated for. “I think that the more that this is viewed as illegitimate by the public, I think that makes it more likely that there is a political permission structure down the road for Democrats to talk about how we can reform the judicial branch of government,” the strategist said. 
But Ferrier responded by warning Fallon that Democrats may regret such a move if they win the majority because it could easily backfire once Republicans regain control. 
“If you are in power one time, you will lose power again,” Ferrier said. “Be careful what you wish for.”

Topher Mathews, publisher of neighborhood blog The Georgetown Metropolitan, has launched a bid for Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, running to replace retiring longtime Commissioner Joe Gibbons. 
Since 2008, Mathews has observed the comings and goings of the Georgetown neighborhood, cataloguing them all on his website. Mathews also served on the board of the Citizens Association of Georgetown, a neighborhood organization promoting safety, beautification and historical preservation, from 2011 until 2020, chairing the transportation committee. He was inspired to run after Gibbons announced his retirement this year. 
The COVID-19 pandemic’s deleterious effect on the neighborhood, including Georgetown restaurants, also spurred Mathews’ campaign. He said he supports expanding outdoor dining to help the food service industry bounce back safely. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) plan allowing indoor service at 50% capacity poses a health risk, according to Mathews.
“With the pandemic, obviously it’s hitting the restaurants in particular the hardest. I certainly support the efforts to provide safe places for them to continue their business,” Mathews said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I would say I am skeptical, or I do not agree fully with the Mayor’s steps to aggressively bring back indoor dining. I don’t agree with that, I think that’s not appropriate at this point.” 
Mathews would also like to bring the Slow Streets initiative, a program launched in June by the District Department of Transportation, which limits traffic and provides more space for pedestrian social distancing, to select streets in Georgetown with restaurants open for outdoor dining. 
“I think we should go further to make the streets around the streateries, particularly the ones that are not on Wisconsin or M Street, more pleasant,” Mathews said. “I would definitely be for bringing Slow Streets to N Street, because you have Martin’s Tavern on one side, Cafe Georgetown on the other.”
The constituency Mathews would represent if elected, Small Member District 02, is home to many Georgetown students living off campus. Mathews sees students as residents just like anyone else he would represent. 
“Ultimately, students living in the neighborhood are still just regular people living in the neighborhood, and they shop at restaurants and stores and ultimately are no different from people who are not students,” Mathews said. “The things that I would fight for would appeal to them just as much.”
Another question facing the Georgetown neighborhood is how to aid people experiencing homelessness. Citywide, family homelessness has decreased over the past five years, while at the same time, the rate at which families exit homelessness has also decreased, according to Street Sense Media.
Just policies would restore the housing status and mental health of the homeless, according to Mathews. 
“I certainly support the construction of more housing for people that can’t otherwise find it,” Mathews said. “And certainly there’s a mental health aspect to a lot of people who are experiencing homelessness that can be addressed from a housing perspective but also really has to be addressed from a public health perspective.” 
This summer saw a nationwide backlash against racial injustice and the police killings of unarmed Black people, with Black Lives Matter protests organized throughout Washington, D.C. Although Mathews supports shifting some duties away from law enforcement, he does not endorse defunding the police. 
“I would not say I support the general proposition of that, but I certainly support a lot of the elements of that,” Mathews said. “Primarily shifting a lot of the responsibilities away that are not ideally served by somebody with a gun, away from that, and with the increase of social services serving a lot of those roles; I certainly support those aspects. It’s hard to buy into a motto like that without necessarily knowing what the specific provisions would be for MPD specifically.”
Another hot topic Mathews weighed in on is the management transfer of Duke Ellington Field in Burleith from District of Columbia Public Schools to the District of Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation. After a DPR controversially granted a local private school privileged access to another field in the neighborhood, residents worried students might lose access to Duke Ellington Field too, although DPR maintains access will remain the same. 
ANC 2E weighed in with a resolution calling for the city to prioritize public school access to the field. DPR is better suited to manage the field, according to Mathews. 
“I definitely support the shifting of Duke Ellington over to DPR,” Mathews said. “I know there’s a lot of concerns from people in the Burleith neighborhood of the ramifications of that, but I think it would be an asset better managed by the department that runs it as its primary responsibility.”

Georgetown University undergraduate students plan to launch a petition demanding the university disclose the nature of its relationship with a trade association that represents America’s electricity companies.
The petition, created by student environmental advocacy groups GU Fossil Free and Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network, asks administrators to disclose information about a conference hosted by Edison Electric Institute at the McDonough School of Business and the extent of Georgetown’s relationship with EEI.
EEI is a trade association that represents all of the nation’s investor-owned electric companies. 
The conference, titled the EEI Campaign Institute and hosted on Georgetown’s main campus in February 2019, was billed as a weeklong “Campaign Institute” meant to teach electric utility lobbyists and executives how to advance their political initiatives.
EEI is committed to increasing profit for fossil fuel companies and stands in opposition to Georgetown’s stated commitments to sustainable financial and campus policies, according to the petition.
“At the Campaign Institute, EEI worked to train utilities executives to justify investments in fossil fuels, fight referenda that would increase renewable portfolio standards, and sanitize their records under the scrutiny of climate activists,” the petition reads.
The petition asks Georgetown to provide information about whether its partnership with EEI extends beyond the campaign institute event. The petition also demands that Georgetown end its partnership with EEI because the company promotes environmentally hazardous practices and campaigns against clean energy.
Petition organizers hope the petition calls attention to the university’s hypocrisy in supporting EEI, according to Victoria Boatwright (COL ’22), the president of GREEN.
“In agreeing to our terms, Georgetown will reject the ‘business-as-usual’ approach that permits corporations and special interests to profit off environmental degradation and carbon emissions, resulting in disastrous environmental consequences and social inequity,” Boatwright wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Boatwright, EEI members FirstEnergy and Arizona Public Service promoted environmentally damaging campaigns, and in some cases, illegal practices. In July, a grand jury indicted former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder (R) and four other Ohio lawmakers for allegedly accepting $60 million in bribes from FirstEnergy in exchange for bailing out two nuclear power plants.
“It is harmful to sit by as bad actors advocate for and spread their malpractices,” Boatwright wrote. “To advocate for a clean, just future and live up to our value of ‘Care for our Common Home’, Georgetown must condemn anti-clean energy campaigns.”
However, the university’s relationship with EEI does not extend past the conference, as it was part of the MSB’s Executive Custom Programs, which are hosted at Georgetown but sponsored by organizations that are not affiliated with the university, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Both EEI programs were initiated by EEI and Georgetown faculty developed their own individual content as part of the conference. No Georgetown students took part in this programming,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The MSB typically hosts between 30 and 40 executive custom programs each year with a wide range of organizations and industries, according to the spokesperson.
EEI chose to host its campaign institute program at Georgetown because of the MSB’s reputable executive education programs, according to EEI Executive Director for External Affairs Brad Viator.
“EEI’s goal was to find an academic institution that could help us to develop a curriculum to teach the current tools, technologies, and strategies that are being used to develop successful campaigns and effective partnerships for today’s public policy issues,” Viator wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Although the university said it has no relationship with EEI aside from the conference, GUFF and GREEN plan to proceed with the petition. Organizers plan to contact Director of the Georgetown Environmental Initiative Pete Marra, the Office of Sustainability and Chief Operating Officer Geoffrey Chatas, according to Boatwright.
Last semester, GUFF successfully pushed for the university to divest from fossil fuels. The club hopes the petition will convince administrators to further commit to sustainability, according to Boatwright.
“If Georgetown truly is governed by this value, it will recommit to the fight against climate change,” the petition reads. “If not, Georgetown will clearly be justifying harm against its students in opposition to its ‘Jesuit Values.’” 
CORRECTION: This article was updated Oct. 11 to correctly attribute the final quote in the piece. The quote is from the petition, not Boatwright.

The Georgetown University McDonough School of Business’ Master of Science in Management program recorded a 296% increase in applications for its latest class.
The graduate program is a 10-month, accelerated business degree program designed to help students who hold non-business bachelor’s degrees to enter the business world. The program’s second cohort will feature a total of 68 students, up from the 31 students in the inaugural 2019 group.
The new class of 2021 will feature students from 17 colleges and universities across the United States. Of the new students in the program, 45% hold Bachelor’s degrees in the humanities, social sciences or liberal arts, 35% in business and finance, 13% in STEM-related fields and 7% in economics, according to the program’s own statistics.
Because cohort members have diverse academic backgrounds, the program features a curriculum specifically designed to ease students into the business field, according to Evelyn Williams, academic director of the program.
“One of the main differences between our program and other competitors is that we actually start with summer programming that helps students learn about the different functions of business and to explore what they might like as a vocation,” Williams wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Since the program began only last year, this year’s applicants were the first to go through a year-long recruitment cycle, as opposed to the six months of recruiting for to the program’s first class. With the longer time period for applications, administrators and admissions deans were able to come up with creative ways to recruit students to the program, according to Nita Swinsick, assistant dean of recruitment and admissions for executive and specialized degree programs.
“Our students from the first cohort also helped immensely by speaking with prospective students about their experiences and enabling candidates to hear about the value of the program firsthand,” Swinsick wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Other possible reasons for the increase in applications could be Georgetown’s proximity to several corporate headquarters, the program’s focus on international business communities or the integration of STEM in the curriculum, according to Williams.
Regardless, applications to the Master’s in Management program will only continue to grow in the future as more people are made aware of its details, according to Swinsick.
“We’re seeing a lot of interest in our Master’s in Management and expect an increase in applications in the coming years, especially as more prospective students learn about this program,” Swinsick wrote. “It’s such a wonderful program which truly helps students become more competitive in the job market.”

Amid a continuing contractual dispute between Georgetown University’s graduate student union and the administration, the Georgetown University Student Association Senate rallied to support the union’s demands.
The GUSA Senate unanimously passed a resolution at its Oct. 4 meeting calling for the university to recognize the right of the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees to bargain for fall semester work policy changes. GAGE recently announced plans to enter arbitration proceedings with the school, arguing the university violated the union’s contract by refusing to bargain with union leadership over the university’s plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The university formally denied the union’s grievance request Thursday morning, all but certifying arbitration proceedings.
Throughout the summer, GAGE lobbied for guaranteed health and economic protections for graduate workers, entering formal bargaining sessions with the university in July. The bargaining sessions proved fruitless, with the university backing out of negotiations in late August, according to GAGE leadership. 
Senate Speaker Leo Teixeira (COL ’21), who introduced the bill, expressed frustration with the administration’s handling of the dispute with GAGE. 
“It is a tremendous failure on the university’s part to so blatantly disregard these graduate workers’ right to unionize and to engage in collective bargaining,” Teixeira said during the meeting. “This should be regarded as a horrific, horrific deed on their part in any circumstance.”
The resolution will hopefully put pressure on the administration to further negotiate with the union, according to Teixeira, who emphasized the importance of supporting vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I think as advocates who represent the student body, we absolutely should stand in solidarity with GAGE with all Georgetown graduate workers and agree to sign on to this as an official stance of GUSA, as well as to urge and demand the university return to the table and give them this COVID agreement,” Teixeira said.
Senator Dominic Gordon (SFS ’24) also expressed dissatisfaction with how the university handled GAGE’s demands.
“I mean, seriously, 200,000 Americans are dead, people,” Gordon said. “[Graduate workers] are going to have issues with COVID-19. We’re going to have to figure out a way to get around this, and I was actually going to ask: did the university provide any reasoning at all for refusing to negotiate? Because to me it just seems ridiculous. I don’t get why the university would not in good faith negotiate with the graduate union.”
The senate also released demographics on diversity of both the current GUSA Senate and of the candidates for the most recent senate election cycle in a presentation created by the GUSA Election Commission. The demographic breakdown highlighted strong LGBTQ, gender and racial diversity in the senate compared to past years. 
Around 57% of the current senate identified as cisgender female, according to the survey. Close to 29% of the senate identified as cisgender male, and 7.1% of senators identified as non-binary; the remaining percentage provided no response. 
Around 43% of senators identified as straight, while 14.3% identified as gay and 25% identified as bisexual. 
Just over 35% of the senate identified as white, according to the survey. An equal proportion of senators — 17.9% — identified as Black and Asian. Close to 4% of senators identified as American Indian/Alaskan Native, and another 17.9% of senators identified as other. 
The presentation also revealed high levels of socioeconomic diversity. While over half of Georgetown students pay full tuition, only 25% of senators reported paying full tuition. Additionally, nine senators reported being first-generation college students and twelve senators reported being part of the Georgetown Scholarship Program, a program that provides support for first-generation and low-income Georgetown students. 
While applauding the increased senate diversity, Election Commision Chair Varsha Menon (SFS ’21) emphasized the need to maintain diversity and not tokenize it. 
“So just kind of keep that in mind that, like, yes, you have a very diverse senate, which is awesome — like more women than men,” Menon said at the meeting. “You have folks who are gender non-conforming, that’s awesome. But, just being aware of keeping it a space where marginalized people can feel like they can be here.”
Menon also mentioned the recent senate election, noting how several senators dropped out of their races because of concerns about a culture of exclusion in the senate.
“You might be wondering, like this isn’t really my place to say that, but it really is because the culture that you foster in the senate, kind of spills over into elections,” Menon said. “There is a first year who withdrew, and he literally said in his candidacy withdrawal that the senate seems so toxic, that it was not going to be good for his mental health, which is not wonderful. That’s not the kind of vibe that I think you guys should aim for.”
