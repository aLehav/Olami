Former New York Times columnist Bob Herbert called for increased attention to poverty facing black America in a lecture Thursday evening.
Sponsored by the Georgetown University Library Associates and the Ellen Catherine Gstalder (COL ’98) Memorial Lecture Fund, Herbert’s lecture primarily focused on the crises that African Americans have experienced and continue to face since the recession.
“We don’t even hear much about it,” Herbert said. “The media can tell us all about Kim Kardashian and who wore what to the Oscars but poverty? Not so much.”
Herbert said that while the economic downturn impacted all Americans, the real tragedy of the United States’ current state can be found in the lives of African Americans.
“While the suffering has been widespread, the worst of the pain has been endured by black Americans,” he said. “And that situation is getting worse, it’s not getting better.”
Herbert spoke about the high unemployment rate for African Americans.
“There are black neighborhoods, and I’ve visited many of them, where hardly anyone has a legitimate job,” he said. “These are neighborhoods where all hope seems to have been lost, where the children themselves seem never to have learned how to dream.”
According to Herbert, many people fail to see the situation of African Americans as worse than any other group in the United States.
“Forget about a recession, there’s a full-blown depression in black America,” he said.
The lack of father figures for black children is a rising problem that can be especially detrimental to the development of young, male African Americans, Herbert said.
Herbert said he was lucky to have his father and several uncles as positive mentors in his life.
“I had father figures galore in my life,” he said. “Compare that life to the lives of so many children, and not just black children, growing up today without fathers in their lives.”
Herbert appealed to Americans to work harder to keep families together. He said he is hopeful that the situation for African Americans will improve.
“Do we have any reason to be optimistic? I hope so,” Herbert said. “Blacks in America have a long and proud history of overcoming hardship and injustice. It’s time to do it again.”

World Bank President Jim Yong Kim presented a bold vision for the end of global poverty in Gaston Hall Tuesday afternoon.
“We now have the opportunity to rid the world of the stain of global poverty and economic exclusion,” Kim said. “But if we are to succeed, we must make some hard decisions.”
He outlined the World Bank’s major goals for the near future, the foremost of which is to end extreme poverty by 2030. Kim argued that the goal can be attained provided growth rates in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa remain high and growth translates into job transference and overall decline of poverty. But Kim acknowledged that the timeline is extremely ambitious, and that success is by no means a guarantee.
“We must move with greater urgency,” Kim said. “We must focus on how the United Nations can work together as a multilateral system more effectively. The challenges in front of us are enormous, but progress is inevitable.”
Kim said that the policy decisions must take into consideration the state of global development, specifically regarding the current economic crisis, which he said still affects world markets despite some leaders’ assurances of economic recovery.
Kim transitioned fluidly between statistics and anecdotes to remind the audience that behind the numbers, world poverty has very real impacts on individuals’ lives.
“Let me stress the human face of this crisis,” Kim said. “We need to restart growth in order to help millions of families. Today, we learned that the overall unemployment rate in the eurozone is 12 percent. This means that people don’t have jobs and are suffering today, and many have lost hope.”
Recalling a trip to China earlier this year, Kim shared the inspiring story of a woman who dreamed of building her own business but lacked the financial means to get started. She scraped by on her husband’s income as a taxi driver until she secured a $10,000 loan from a local bank as part of a program promoting female entrepreneurship. The International Finance Corporation, a private sector branch of the World Bank, sponsored this loan, allowing her to successfully open her own car repair shop, which now employs approximately 150 individuals.
Kim cited such stories as the reason for his positive outlook. With advances in the social sectorcombatting HIV/AIDS, especially in children, Kim said there is great promise for the improvement of global conditions.  For example, in 1990, 43 percent of the international population lived on less than $1.25 per day. That statistic had fallen to 21 percent by 2010.
“We are at an auspicious moment in history when the successes of past decades and an increasingly favorable economic outlook combine to give developing countries a chance for the first time ever to end extreme poverty,” Kim said.
Kim stressed the importance of inclusive growth that includes people from across the globe, deeming action toward the betterment of human conditions a moral imperative. Kim cited the 1.3 billion people still living in extreme poverty and the 6.9 million children under the age of five that die every year.
“Fighting extreme poverty, however, is not enough,” Kim said. “We must collectively work to enable these individuals to lift themselves well above the line of poverty and boost shared prosperity.”
Kim concluded by stressing the importance of addressing these issues for the sake of the younger generation.
“A world without extreme poverty is the world we want for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren,” Kim said. “The opportunity is squarely in front of us, now we must seize the arc of history and bend it towards justice.”

Bringing together writers and artists from around the world, the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practices held its seventh Spring Symposium and Literary Festival April 2 and 3.
The symposium — titled “America from the Outside: How the World Sees US” — was sponsored by the Lannan Foundation, a family foundation that includes some Georgetown alumni and promotes cultural freedom, diversity and creativity.
Three-time symposium Director Henry Schwarz chose this year’s symposium theme based on experiences as a teacher more than 10 years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
“The students and I were turning a corner with the election of Obama and the wrapping up of the wars and so on because, almost for the first time since 9/11, we were able to think clearly about what these years had meant because we had lived under the shock of responding to terrorist attacks,” Schwarz said.
According to Schwarz, this realization coincided with his exposure to the works of the symposium’s speakers and prompted him to structure this year’s symposium around how the world views the United States in the aftermath of 9/11.
“The idea of coming to some sort of reckoning with 9/11 with these new cultural and political developments just seemed very exciting and exhilarating,” Schwarz said.
The conference began Tuesday afternoon with a screening of Heidi Ewing (SFS ’93) and Rachel Grady’s 2012 documentary “Detropia” about the decline of Detroit’s economy and its effect on the city’s residents.
Later that evening, journalist Naomi Klein and television journalist and documentary filmmaker AviLewis spoke in Gaston Hall about “The Take,” their documentary about Argentina’s occupied factories.
Schwarz said that he invited Klein to speak because of her reputation as an outspoken critic of corporate globalization and of her appreciation for the symposium’s theme.
“She’s an icon of our times and an essential figure of progressive culture,” Schwarz said. “She shared a desperate argument that our very existence is in our hands, and people understood that powerfully.”
The symposium continued Wednesday morning with an event entitled “America the Beautiful,” featuring Ewing, New York University professor Wafaa Bilal and photographer Trevor Paglen, whose recent works all relate to the War on Terror and 21st -century America.
Bilal, known for his live performance interactive art about international politics, spoke about his 2007 piece, “Domestic Tension,” in which he lived in a Chicago gallery space for 31 days during which viewers could observe his everyday activities and shoot a paintball gun at him via a website.
“The results were inspiring, healing, yet deeply disturbing,” Bilal said.
Ewing spoke about the conflation of religion and politics in the shadow of the War on Terror.
“You can’t dodge the War on Terror or dodge your era,” Ewing said. “Every story has been affected in some way by 9/11.”
Paglen, who uses astrophotography to capture black sites such as secret air bases in the United States and CIA prisons in Afghanistan, shared a selection of his photographs related to secrecy and covert operations.
“Secrecy is a logic … but when that logic intersects with what the world is made of, there are lots of contradictions,” Paglen said.
The symposium also featured readings by poets Naomi Ayala, Dinaw Mengestu (COL ’00) andAbdourahman Waberi. The readings offered insight into how 9/11 has impacted relations between the United States and the rest of the world. A panel discussion between symposium speakers and Georgetown professors followed the presentations.
During the panel, Mengetsu said that the convergence of politics and aesthetics makes for challenging but illuminating subject matter.
“What you hope, on the novelistic side, is that you’ve absorbed the politics that are important to you, and these merge and support each other in tandem with aesthetics,” Mengetsu said.
Journalist Christopher Hedges concluded the symposium with a speech about the United States’ overall foreign policy, including foreign aid and international defense.
“All of the correctives, all of the openings for American democracy come through radical movements that never achieve formal positions,” Hedges said.
Hedges added that the U.S. foreign policy has created an international environment of fear.
“As a journalist, it’s been very disturbing to watch … Obama’s harsh measures of confinement, torture and government effort against whistleblowers,” Hedges said. “People are too frightened to speak.”
Hedges called for a restoration of reform movements and encouraged attendees to question the government.
“People held against their will and forced to work — that’s the future,” Hedges said. “It is only by building those movements out of the formal mechanisms of power that we have any hope of saving the planet and protecting ourselves.”
Overall, Schwarz said he was pleased with the symposium’s results, despite minimal student attendance.
“These types of events are equally, if not more, educational than classroom learning,” Schwarz said. “To see students attending with some regularity, as if this were a required event, would be gratifying.”
D.C. resident Donna Graham has attended the Lannan Symposium for the last several years said she felt the presentations were enlightening.
“The presentations were both informative and scary,” Graham said. “I keep coming back because I always enjoy being exposed to the new authors and artists that participate in the conference.”
Jay Plamondon, an exchange student from Middlebury College, agreed, specifically regarding Hedges’ speech.
“It was interesting to hear about the defense rhetoric that stresses keeping American power strong, but there’s never a voice questioning that authority,” Hedges said. “[That questioning] is played off as fringe movement, but Hedges showed how it’s actually refreshing.”

After a first-place finish in 2012, Andrew Arsht (COL ’14) and Andrew Markoff (SFS ’14) of Georgetown’s debate team finished third in the National Debate Tournament last weekend.
Seventy-eight duos from colleges across the country, including three from Georgetown, competed in the tournament at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah, from March 28 to April 1. A pair from Emporia State University won after beating Northwestern University, which had defeated Georgetown in the semifinal round of the tournament.
“It was disappointing because we always look to win,” Markoff said. “Our research didn’t quite get us where we wanted to be.”
In addition to winning the tournament in 2012, Arsht was named best speaker at last year’s conference.
“Their loss to Northwestern was pretty surprising and kind of disappointing,” Holden Choi (SFS ’16), a member of the Georgetown debate team, said. “The rest of us had kind of taken for granted how good the Andrews were.”
Fellow debate team member Andy McCoy (SFS ’16) agreed and praised the Northwestern team.
“They just got us,” McCoy said. “They’re excellent, and they have a really good coaching staff.”
The other two Georgetown teams, the first composed of Tyler Engler (SFS ’15) and McCoy and the second Choi and Peter Vale (COL ’14), lost in the preliminary rounds, both to pairs from Harvard.
Choi said that the tournament could be extremely stressful for participants, even those who have been attending competitions for their entire high school and college careers.
“It’s not surprising to see people break down,” Choi said. “It’s a lot to handle.”
Engler agreed, citing his own high school debate career.
“I did debate for four years in high school,” Engler said. “[In college], it’s more intense, more time intensive, but it’s essentially the same animal.”
This year’s debate topic focused on whether the federal government should increase domestic energy production. In the preliminary rounds, debaters must negate and affirm the resolution a total of four times, while in elimination rounds, the position of each team is decided by coin flip. Each round lasts 1.5 hours, with individual speeches taking six to nine minutes.
The team competes once or twice a month at universities across the country beginning in January, with all competitions focused on a single topic. To prepare, team members spend 20 to 40 hours a week researching a topic and practicing their arguments.
“There’s a constant arms race to find the best arguments,” Markoff said.
Debaters stayed on campus during spring break to prepare for the tournaments, with those who did not compete helping the teams conduct research, including at last weekend’s tournament.
“It was awe-inspiring to see everyone working as one collective unit,” McCoy said.
Markoff agreed and said team members were very close.
“We’ve all become really good friends, really good collaborators and teammates,” Markoff added.

After months of advocating for comprehensive, mandatory sexual assault education during New Student Orientation, the GUSA Sexual Assault Working Group has reached a temporary compromise to introduce voluntary discussions during Welcome Week.
While former Georgetown University Student Association Deputy Chief of Staff Lisa Frank (COL ’13) had hoped to insert a mandatory, hour-long group workshop on sexual assault, NSO coordinators said they saw too many conflicts with NSO’s tight schedule already determined.
Instead, the less formal, voluntary ice cream social during Welcome Week will provide a forum for discussion for those interested in the topic. Additionally, an extension to the script of a play duringNSO with mandatory attendance will address sexual assault on campus. AlcoholEdu will also be updated to address the issue of sexual assault more thoroughly in both the questionnaire and media portions of the online training program, which is mandatory for freshmen.
Despite the failure to incorporate a dedicated workshop into NSO, Frank said that the NSO Show’s update is an improvement.
“Sexual assault will still be a more prevalent part of NSO than it has in the past,” Frank said. “TheNSO Show introduces a lot of important issues in it and this year they are looking to do a lot more student interaction … It’s getting moved to the first day of NSO and then there will be a discussion with your main groups right after that … so that’s a really great development.”
Nora West (SFS ’15), secretary of student health and a safety and sexual assault peer educator, is still pushing to add a mandatory sexual assault workshop to NSO in the future, while GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) has made sexual assault education a priority in his spring agenda for the rest of this year.
“We are still planning for NSO in the future because our Welcome Week program is self-selecting … and we don’t want it to be a discussion between people who are used to discussing these issues,” West said.
Frank agreed, emphasizing how participation must be compulsory in order to be successful.
“One of the other advantages is that [NSO] is mandatory, and we think that Georgetown does need to move towards having a mandatory sexual assault workshop discussion,” Frank said. “We will still be in conversations with administrators over the summer to say what worked well from the sessions [during Welcome Week] and what didn’t and go from there.”
Frank stressed the importance of introducing the sexual assault discussion early in students’ college careers.
“If you want to change the culture [at Georgetown], the way to do it is with that incoming class because then, in four years, everyone has had training and everyone is in a much better place to talk about these issues and help their friends out,” Frank said.
GUSA Sexual Assault Working Group member Chandini Jha (COL ’16) agreed, referencing the “red zone” — the six-week period at the start of the school year when freshmen are at the highest risk of sexual assault.
“The fact is that when you come to the college campus, you’re away from the traditional environment and safety nets … so people have a hard time identifying what sexual assault may be,” Jha said. “You’re really an adult now and you need to deal with these issues and if you don’t have or know that you have the resources to deal with these problems then that’s an issue.”
Frank said the discussions would centralize around the education and perception of sexual assault, rather than prevention.
“I think the message that Georgetown students hear loud and clear is that if you are a woman, you’re at risk. If you drink, you’re at risk. If you walk alone, you’re at risk. And we’re sorry, but we can’t do anything about that, but tell you about it,” Frank said. “That’s not what we should be hearing here.”
West stressed the importance of giving students the tools to use the right language in discussions about sexual assault.
“It’s a discussion, not a training,” West said of the initiative. “Sexual Assault Peer Education discusses consent, resources on campus, the creation of environment against sexual assault… how we can use proper language in the discussion … It’s a place for students to figure out what consent means to them.”
Jha said the question of consent is a prominent issue among incoming students.
“The most heartbreaking thing is when [friends] say they don’t know if they’ve been sexually assaulted, you feel almost as if you have your control taken away from you,” Jha said. “We don’t want freshmen to be scared to talk about sexual assault … but the confusion about sexual assault and consent is something that we really need to address.”

The Office of International Programs announced Wednesday that it has cancelled the Georgetown 2013 Summer Program in Alexandria, Egypt, citing safety risks.
“While security concerns have generally been limited to a few locations in Egypt and foreigners have not been targeted, the unrest is expected to escalate in the near future due to fuel and food shortages,” Associate Director of Overseas Studies Lisa Gordinier wrote in an email to students enrolled in the program.
In January 2011, Georgetown students studying abroad at the American University in Cairo were evacuated following protests against then-president Hosni Mubarak. The program resumed that summer, but Derrik Sweeney (COL ’13), who was studying abroad at AUC, was arrested later that year in November for allegedly taking part in violent protests.
“We were told there was a possibility of cancellation, but I was also told that the trip usually went on no matter what and they even went the summer after the Arab Spring,” said Ross Wasserman (COL ’16), who was set to study in Alexandria this summer.
Fellow enrollee Haley Lepp (COL ’15) said that OIP claimed the cancellation was largely attributable to an increase in violence against women and in areas that had not previously seen severe unrest.
According to OIP Executive Director Katherine Bellows, the office surveys the security climates in every country where it operates.
“The criteria used in making a decision are multifaceted and include the gathering and assessment of information from many different sources including Georgetown’s own regional faculty experts,” Bellows wrote in a statement.
The program would have taken place at Alexandria University from June 5 to Aug. 15 and incorporated cultural activities, including a trip to Cairo, with intensive Arabic studies at all levels. Participants — 23 Georgetown and two non-Georgetown students — were to receive 12 credits for their studies.
Some students who had enrolled in the program say that the cancellation will throw their academic plans off course.
“This program was integral to my academic plan, as I am going abroad next year to London and will not be taking intensive Arabic classes there,” Elizabeth Cheung (SFS ’15) said. “Alexandria would have increased my chances of passing the proficiency test post-London.”
Lepp, who is considering transferring to the Walsh School of Foreign Service, said that she might have to stay in the College because her chances of achieving the SFS-mandated language proficiency will be inhibited by the cancellation.
Others expressed similar concerns about their academic futures.
“I applied because I wanted to complete Georgetown’s third level of Arabic before studying abroad at the School of Oriental and African Studies next year so that once in London, I could take fourth level Arabic classes that Georgetown does not really offer,” Simone Gannage (SFS ’15) said.
OIP has provided those enrolled in the program with information about alternatives, such as the Georgetown School of Continuing Studies’ Arabic and Persian Language Institute, which would award six credits for its intensive option.
“Had I been told two weeks ago that they were looking into cancelling the program, I would have applied for internships, other summer Arabic programs and anything else I could think of, just in case they did,” Gannage said. “Now, a lot of the deadlines have passed, leaving me with not that many options.”
Student deposits will be refunded upon request or credited for future use from their accounts.
According to Bellows, there have been no status changes as of now with any other summer or fall programs, including the fall study abroad program at the American University in Cairo.  “We will monitor the events in Egypt over the next couple of months before making a decision on that program,” Bellows wrote.

As students eye the finish line of the academic year and count the days until summer vacation, GUSAPresident Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) are taking an unprecedented step to encourage no such slacking among their staff.
The Georgetown University Student Association leaders released a spring agenda Thursday, which outlined priorities for each member of their executive cabinet for the remainder of the academic year.
“We picked the things we can do this semester and also things that we could start this semester and achieve fully later in the year,” Tisa said.
Tisa emphasized that the agenda was not intended as a checklist, but rather as a means to actively engage with the student body.
“We’re putting this out to hold us accountable and keep us transparent,” Tisa said. “The executive always does a lot of work, but there may be some students out there working on the same thing or [who] have ideas to do things in a better way but don’t know what’s going on with GUSA.”
The first item listed on the agenda was to combat sexual assault, which mandates increased sexual assault awareness programming during New Student Orientation, advocacy for clear disciplinary amnesty policies for victims of assault and sexual assault training for student leaders. These efforts would build on recent agreements to address sexual assault during the NSO show and as part ofAlcoholEdu and address recent failures to incorporate a mandatory hour-long sexual assault discussion into NSO.
“Reporting of sexual assault is extremely low at Georgetown, as it is elsewhere. Part of that is due to taboos and negative culture,” Tisa said. “We want to facilitate an environment that is comfortable for survivors to report cases. If you report a sexual assault you should not be charged with drinking, drug use or any other circumstance that may have been happening at the time but is totally irrelevant to the fact that someone chose to become a perpetrator.”
Since taking office, Tisa has repeatedly cited the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, which mandates that the university house 90 percent of undergraduates on campus by fall 2025, as the largest challenge facing his administration.
As a result, the agenda also includes easing restrictions on on-campus socializing, which would involve extending party hours, relaxing limits on kegs and reevaluating apartment safety capacity levels.
“Especially with Georgetown Day coming up, Georgetown students study hard and work hard, and there’s nothing wrong with wanting to party hard,” Tisa said. “There is a lot that students, administrators and the neighborhood can agree upon. While maintaining safety standards, students should be able to socialize without the fear of punishment.”
For athletics, GUSA plans to actively solicit student feedback on the construction of the new Intercollegiate Athletic Center. Tisa also aims to continue advocating for the creation of a clubs sports trainers program, an initiative that former GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) introduced with limited results during their term.
Student Advocacy Office Co-Directors Ben Manzione (SFS ’15) and Michelle Mohr (COL ’15) said that priority would also be given to the tentative fall 2013 launch of a mobile app containing the Code of Student Conduct.
“We recognize that there is a need to better communicate the code to the students,” Mohr said. “Multiple different sources have come up with the idea that technology would be the best way. The [Disciplinary Review Committee] proposed the idea, Clara and Vail talked about it and individual students have also been discussing about it.”
According to Mohr, the mobile app would detail various scenario cases, better informing students about their judicial process rights.
Manzione added that SAO is also planning to create an online form on the GUSA website and through the mobile app, allowing students to submit questions about their cases or the Code of Student Conduct.
“We’re trying to make it easier for students to navigate the Code of Conduct and know their rights,”Manzione said.
Secretary of Academic Affairs Guy Mentel (COL ’14) prioritized mandating Blackboard Gradebookusage — an initiative the GUSA senate recently launched.Specifically, Mentel said he would work closely with the GUSA senate Intellectual Life Committee to discuss the idea with the academic councils of each school.
“After we’ve spoken to academic councils of each school and garnered their support, then we’re going to take it to the administration and say, ‘We have the GUSA executive, GUSA senate and the academic representative of each school behind this,’” Mentel said.
Secretary of Sustainability Gabe Pincus (SFS ’14) narrowed his focus to purchasing recycling bins for on-campus apartments and townhouses and creating recycling signs throughout campus in residence halls and academic buildings.
In addition, Pincus said he would continue working with the university administration to establish an Office of Sustainability, an unfinished initiative from Gustafson’s administration. However, little progress has been made since the initiative stalled last year.
“We’re continuing to work with facilities to come up with some viable office at the moment,” Pincussaid. “Hopefully, there will be something soon.”
Other initiatives on the agenda include arts advertising to the neighborhood community, practice spaces for performing arts groups in light of Healey Family Student Center construction, recruitment for an LGBTQ mentoring program and certification of double the number of current student Safe Rides drivers.

Georgetown University and the Georgetown Business Improvement District are looking to have the city-wide D.C. Streetcar project expanded deeper into the Georgetown area.
 
“Both the university and the BID are interested in how to get the streetcar to serve the university population since it is such an employment concentration and generally a concentration of people that are heavy transit users,” said Jonathon Kass, transportation director of the Georgetown BID,.
 
Lauralyn Lee, Georgetown’s associate vice president for community engagement and strategic initiatives, said that because the university is one of the largest employers in D.C., with nearly 9,000 employees and thousands of students, an additional transportation method would benefit the university community.
 
“We just think that it would be unfortunate if you do a study that brings people into Georgetown that can’t get them up to the campus,” Lee said. “That would minimize the opportunity that’s created by this additional public transportation option.”
 
Kass agreed, saying that both Georgetown and BID are interested in making the university a focal point for the expansion of the One City Line, which is currently planned to extend from the Georgetown waterfront to Benning Road.
 
“The combination of a serious concentration of employment and the student population that often uses transit outside of the peak times is more than the average population,” Kass said, noting that streetcar systems in Tucson, Atlanta, Portland and Providence have all made an effort to integrate local universities into their networks. “Extending to the university can be a real opportunity to fill what are otherwise empty seats.”
 
According to Lee, a streetcar connection to Georgetown would align well with its long-term plan to create more sustainable commuting and transport options.
 
“In the long-term, we’re looking at anything and everything that’s creative that might offer solutions, and the streetcar, because it was kind of part of the city’s strategy for how to handle public transportation opportunities for its residents, really struck us a great opportunity to do that,” Lee said.
 
Kass added that there have not yet been any discussions about the path that an extended streetcar line to the university would take, but that the District of Columbia Department of Transportation has not eliminated the possibility of expanding the system, which is expected to include 37 miles of track by the time of its completion in 30 years.
 
“From DDOT, we have heard a willingness to talk about how to get to the university,” Kass said. “They’ve been clear that the boundaries of the current study don’t allow any … assessment of alternatives, but they have suggested that they will take an initial look, so they seem very willing to work with us.”
 
However, Lee said that streetcar plans that have already been approved would include stops near Georgetown’s other campuses, including its new School of Continuing Studies campus near Mount Vernon square, slated to open in late 2013, and the Law Center. As such, it would make sense for the line to extend to the university’s main campus. She noted that the university wants the line to reach as close to main campus as possible, at the very least closer than the Circulator stop located at O Street and Wisconsin Avenue.
 
The D.C. Streetcar project will complement the current Metro and Circulator systems and establish the first streetcar system in the District since the previous one was dismantled in 1962. The complete system is expected to connect the Georgetown waterfront area to downtown D.C. via K Street.
 
“There’s still a lot of planning that has to get done in order for those [tracks] to be built,” said DaraWard, a spokesperson for the D.C. Streetcar project. She added that DDOT must consider a myriad of factors including streetcars’ impact on pedestrians and other traffic and streetcar stop locations prior to construction.
 
The first of these streetcar lines is to run from Union Station to Oklahoma Avenue via H Street, NE and Benning Road and is expected to open by October 2013. Approximately 80 percent of track construction was completed in prior years during the H Street, NE Great Streets Initiative to revitalize the area.
 
The remaining 20 percent of construction includes the installation of a stop and turnaround at the Hopscotch Bridge, a turnaround at the eastern end of the bridge and a connection to the streetcar yard and soon-to-be-built car barn training center.
Once this line has been tested, certified and opened for passenger service, DDOT will move forward with planning and construction for additional tracks.
 
Twenty-two miles of the proposed system have been prioritized to be built first. The prioritized lines include those from the waterfront to Union Station, Takoma to Buzzard Point and Buzzard Point toAnacostia.
Within the next two weeks, DDOT will release its findings from a feasibility study conducted last fall and eventually perform an environmental assessment. An additional study concerning transportation from Union Station to the Georgetown waterfront must still be completed before DDOT can extend the project into downtown D.C. and Georgetown.
 
Ward said that there is still no estimate of when the line would reach the Georgetown area.
 
But the project could be fast-tracked with Mayor Vincent Gray’s newest budget proposal, which allocates millions of dollars toward the transportation system.
 
“Everyone would like to move as quickly as possible,” Kass said. “The mayor’s budget proposal released last week with $400 million extended over the next six years to the streetcar network is a real sign of the desire to move fast.”
 
While there is support for the expansion of D.C. Streetcar into Georgetown — including from Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner Bill Starrels, who said that streetcars would have a positive impact on the area — the project will not be without neighborhood concerns.
 
“Naturally there are people who would rather not lose parking lanes. There are people that would rather not lose traffic lanes and there are people that would rather have wider sidewalks,” Kass said. “When it comes to sharing the right of way, there are always a lot of interests and understandable desires.”

Georgetown professors who live near campus in West Georgetown and Burleith seem to be caught between two opposing worlds.
What Mayor Vincent Gray at an Oct. 3, 2011, Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E public meeting dubbed Georgetown’s “creeping presence” into the surrounding area has drawn scores of complaints from aggrieved neighbors.
According to Anna von der Goltz, a history professor who lives in university-owned housing close to campus, faculty members who have feet in both the school and the surrounding community can feel conflicted.
“They do see themselves as caught in the middle,” von der Goltz said.
“I talk with and hear from my neighbors very frequently, and their observations on this subject are the same as mine,” ANC 2E Chair Ron Lewis wrote in a Nov. 8, 2011, supplemental report to the D.C. Zoning Commission. “The loud and disruptive late-night student behavior has continued this fall at the same objectionable levels as in the past.”
The university’s compromise agreement with neighborhood groups on its 2010 Campus Plan last summer, including the landmark formation of the Georgetown Community Partnership, has ushered in a new phase of cooperation and detente. But tensions nonetheless remain, as confirmed by the university’s March announcement that it would redouble its efforts to enforce off-campus noise policies while launching a new shuttle service to Dupont Circle and Adams Morgan on weekend evenings.
As residents themselves, some professors characterized the disturbances from student parties as less severe and less widespread than neighbors typically make them out to be.
“There have been problems with student noise, but it’s not constant throughout Burleith,” said Eric Langenbacher, a professor in the government department who has been a member of the Burleith Citizens Association for nearly 15 years. “I live near 35th and T, and we haven’t had problems with student noise — party noise — for years.”
Matthew Kroenig, a professor in the government department who lives a few blocks from campus in West Georgetown, agreed with Langenbacher.
“The students don’t bother me at all,” Kroenig said. “I know some neighbors complain about noise. I think if you’re outside Rhino late at night on a weekend, then it can be a problem. But if you go a couple blocks up the hill, it’s an incredibly tranquil neighborhood.”
Even when neighbors do find a party to complain about, Langenbacher said that they should not automatically blame Georgetown students.
“If I can think back to some of the more problematic houses over the years, they aren’t usually students,” Langenbacher said. “They’re usually young professionals and whatnot.”
In addition, Kroenig pointed out that noise from parties is to be expected for those who live near  college campuses.
“The university has been there since 1789, so I’m pretty sure it was here before any of the residents bought their houses,” Kroenig said. “They kind of knew what they were getting themselves into … buying a place a block from the university. If you live a few blocks from a college campus, there are going to be college students.”
Von der Goltz added that new measures such as shuttle services will have minimal impact on reducing noise.
“I think students will also have house parties if they live in the neighborhood,” she said. “It’s not going to solve the whole problem.”
Although the university seeks to move more of the student population back on campus, Langenbacher believes that living off-campus is a valuable component of student life.
“I think that it is important for young people to learn how to live in various kinds of neighborhood,” he said. “There is a lot of value added from living off-campus.”
But sometimes creating reasonable policy to accommodate both student needs and neighbor desires is complicated by the residents themselves.
“There has been a group of neighbors that is quite angry,” Langenbacher said. “They’ve been angry for a long time. If you talk to them or get into it with them, the anger shows. The anger is not just directed at students or representatives of the university but sometimes toward neighbors who don’t entirely endorse their views.”
Within the BCA, Langenbacher said that members who are vocal may appear to represent the organization even if not everyone in association shares the same complaints about students.
“I do know for a fact because of conversations I’ve had — email exchanges on the Burleith Listserv and stuff like that — that not everybody was in agreement with the vocal stance that the Burleith Citizens Association took in regards to the campus plan,” Langenbacher said. “There are issues with student noise and whatnot that are legitimate issues and they have to be dealt with … but the BCA has to understand that there are people with feet in both worlds. I myself would have liked to see a more balanced stance on the part of the BCA, but that’s not always how it works out.”
Von der Goltz agreed, saying that some neighbors seemed to oppose “anyone who is not seen as conforming to a particular standard.”
“In general, I think Georgetown homeowners are somewhat peculiar and pedantic,” von der Goltz said. “Longtime residents are quite keen to keep things ordinary and tidy.”
But she also said that she understands both student and neighbor perspectives.
“You can kind of see how tensions would erupt,” von der Goltz said. “In some ways, it can be avoided, and I’m sympathetic to both sides.”
In a demonstration of the ambiguity that characterizes his unique position, however, Langenbacher stressed that the university had to regain the trust of the neighborhood.
“A lot of people in the community perceive that the university made rhetorical efforts in the past, and there was no follow-through,” Langenbacher said. “They didn’t put their money where their mouth was.”
Langenbacher added that the BCA was “cautiously optimistic” about town-gown relations in part because of leadership changes within the BCA and the university and initiatives like the Georgetown Community Partnership.
As for specific solutions, Langenbacher believes that signs across the neighborhood reminding people to limit noise, a Listserv for students who live off campus to allow the dispersal of notices reiterating rules and norms and more meetings between students and neighbors would help.
Kroenig had an idea that’s probably not going to gain traction with either side.
“I think the students should just invite their neighbors to the parties. I think they’re just envious that they’re missing out on the fun.”

There was fortunately no April Fools’ prank awaiting 2,413 students who received regular decision letters of acceptance to the Georgetown Class of 2017, a record portion of whom identify as racial minorities.
Of the 19,879 students that applied, 16.6 percent were admitted in the combined early and regular decision cycles, a slight bump from last year’s record low of 16.5 percent.
The McDonough School of Business, with an acceptance rate of 15.7 percent, was the most selective school for the first time ever, a distinction traditionally reserved for Georgetown College. The acceptance rate for the College, at 16.3 percent, was the only one to increase from last year across the four schools. Admission to the School of Nursing and Health Studies and the Walsh School of Foreign Service, both at 17.7 percent, also grew more competitive this year.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69) attributed the distribution to the current state of the economy and increasing pressure for students to choose “practical” majors.
“Students seem very concerned with secure career choices, which is why we’re seeing this increase inMSB [and] NHS majors,” Deacon said.
There was a three-point bump from last year in the number of accepted students who identify as Hispanic, now at 11 percent. Thirteen percent of admitted students identified as Asian and eight percent as black, both down two percent from last year’s accepted class. Seven percent of accepted students identified with multiple races. These combined figures have resulted in Georgetown’s most diverse admitted class ever, with 39 percent coming from minority backgrounds.
In addition, a record number of first-generation college students — 12 percent — were admitted, which Deacon attributed to the Georgetown Scholarship Program.
“We continue to ask ourselves, ‘How can we go about doing a better job reaching out, levelling the playing field and attracting students from all backgrounds?’” Deacon said. “Raising money [for financial aid] is a critical question for the changing character of Georgetown.”
The accepted class is 55 percent female, slightly lower than the national trend of about 58 percent female, according to The New York Times.
International students made up 11 percent of admitted students, up from last year’s eight percent. The largest groups of foreign students were accepted from China, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Georgetown admitted students from all 50 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and 69 other countries, although the applicant pool indicated interest from students in 119 countries, according to Margaret Lysy, associate director of the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.
The two most represented states in the admitted class were California and New York, with 396 and 392 students, respectively. New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia saw 280, 180 and 159 students accepted, respectively.
Deacon emphasized that a major component of achieving a more diverse Georgetown will be a healthy endowment that allows the university to offer more generous financial aid packages to those who are accepted.
The Georgetown admissions process continues to distinguish itself from other universities with its mandatory interview and refusal to use the Common Application.
This decision results in fewer applicants and higher acceptance rates compared to peer institutions such as Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania, which had their lowest admissions rates on record with 5.79 and 12.1 percent, respectively, according to The New York Times. Yet Deacon believes the process allows Georgetown to take a more holistic approach to admissions, which includes mailing applicants their decisions rather than posting them online.
“We’ve held on to this way of doing it that we find to be a more appropriate way to end what has been a very lengthy and very important process in your life,” Deacon said.
Students on the waitlist must hold out until after May 1, when deposits are due, to find out whether they will join next year’s freshman class.
According to Deacon, the university has placed 2,000 students on the waitlist, from which it has traditionally taken around 50 to 100 people to reach its target number of 1,580 students — a number that has remained consistent for several years due to restrictions in the campus plan.

Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey has solicited student, faculty and staff input into Georgetown’s long-term strategic master planning through two surveys, MyCommute and MyCampus, both released April 2.
“We need to be cognizant of how our clients use the facilities on campus, how they navigate, where they eat,” Morey said in explaining the impetus for the surveys. “I think, anecdotally, we know certain things, but if the students input that data and we can see it live, it will validate what we know and give us info that we didn’t already know. … Data is what can help drive good decisions.”
Morey said that the survey’s results would impact future decisions such as possible new dining areas and traffic engineering.
The surveys, which close April 16, have already attracted strong turnout.
As of Wednesday, 1,700 faculty and staff had completed MyCommute, while as of Thursday, 1,316 students, faculty and staff had completed MyCampus. Approximately 45 percent of MyCampusrespondents were students, while approximately 25 percent were staff and only 6 percent were faculty.
MyCommute was designed to measure faculty and staff commuting and traffic patterns around campus, focusing on campus parking, Georgetown University Transportation Shuttles and public transportation use, while the MyCampus survey sought to determine which areas of campus are used for which purposes.
Based on information about workers’ and graduate students’ commuting habits to and from the university, the university could potentially create new initiatives to reduce car traffic and parking on campus, increase biking opportunities, make pedestrian walks friendlier and incentivize carpooling, according to Morey.
“The idea isn’t, you know, people need to get to work, so build more parking — that’s not a sustainable approach,” Morey said. “We want to do transportation in a green, sustainable way.”
Morey also cited the economic benefits of more sustainable commuting habits. New parking lots would replace valuable on-campus green space, while building new underground parking would be expensive.
“We need to balance the extent to which we can leverage people’s habits so that they can get to work and make it more convenient to change their behavior,” Morey said. “If we can know what these behaviors are, we can make programs to do that.”
In MyCampus, participants were asked to indicate their most commonly used areas of campus by dragging various icons onto an overhead satellite image of the main campus. Icons represented categories of use, such as studying, socializing, dining, classes and living.
Participants were also asked to draw their usual on-campus traveling patterns by walking, biking or driving. Respondents also answered questions about dangerous areas of campus, whether due to traffic, crime or other causes. Finally, the survey asked participants to indicate the location of the “heart of campus” as well as to highlight the core area of campus.
Students who took the survey had ideas they hoped would be considered at some point in the planning process.
Lindsay Kolowich (COL ’13) focused on the transportation and safety portions of the survey.
“The [portion of the survey that addressed] areas that students deemed unsafe was the most useful, in terms of using the information for the future,” Kolowich said.
Kolowich, however, doubted her input would be incorporated into the final stages of the planning process.
“I’m not sure how much it will impact future decisions,” Kolowich said. “I saw it more as a cool way to track which types of people use different facilities.”
Andrew Haddad (SFS ’15), who did not take the survey, also doubted its impact.
“The school keeps sending out a number of random surveys, and I don’t know how much it will actually do,” Haddad said. “It’s hard to tell [which] surveys are actually important and will get used.”
But Alex Barnes (SFS ’16), who would like to see renovation to outdoor areas of campus, including more outdoor seating in Harbin Patio, was more optimistic about the effectiveness of the survey.
“I think it’s important to provide good feedback, especially if the survey is going to be a long-term thing. Hopefully, the university will use this for several years to come and when they’re considering new building projects,” Barnes said. “I think it’s going to be something they refer to repeatedly.”

Since its release in 2006, the musical “Spring Awakening” has brought controversy to the stage and left amazed audiences in its wake. These aren’t your typical showtunes, and these aren’t your traditional Broadway themes or plot. And with performances starting this Thursday, Mask & Bauble is staging this unconventional Tony Award-nominated musical in the Davis Performing Arts Center.
“Spring Awakening” is a rock musical by Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater, complete with handheld microphones and dry ice. It is based on the 1891 German play by the same name and openly discusses controversial topics, such as abortion, masturbation, homosexuality, rape, child abuse and suicide, using soulful ballads, angsty group numbers and poignant dialogue. As you can imagine, these were not easy themes to deal with for college-aged actors, but the cast pulled it off with incredible maturity and a staggering level of talent. This is made even more impressive by the fact that two of the most difficult roles are taken on by freshmen: Olivia Duff (COL ’16) and Andrew Walker (SFS’16), who play Wendla Bergman and Moritz Stiefel, respectively.
“Spring Awakening is a coming-of-age story, but it is presented from the perspective and in the language of the adolescents [who] are coming of age, not their adult ‘oppressors’” Walker said. “The process has been emotionally draining, but you know how important the work you’re doing is and how important it is to tell these characters’ stories, and you just push through it.”
Both of these freshmen give stellar performances despite the difficulties these roles pose. The emphasis of the show is on the troubled and complex characters, which is a trial that director Hannah Hauer-King (COL ’14) was more than ready to handle.
“Character work for this process was challenging but even more so exciting,” Hauer-King said. “It is important not to vilify or simplify any of the characters within the piece. Even the adults who are the source of the children’s anxiety and distress must be seen as tragic characters, a product of a society that limits expression and intimacy.”
Acting opposite Duff and Walker, John Roach (COL ’13) portrays the role of the misunderstood Melchior with an authenticity that is sure to break hearts in multiple scenes.
“Every character is integral in telling this story, and that is a testament to the incredible actors we have working on this show and [Hauer-King’s] brilliant direction,” says Walker.
Kyle O’Donnell (COL ’14), who undertakes the role of Hanschen, echoed these thoughts and described his own character as a self-important, driven and snarky individual. This character poses several unique challenges that stem from his sexual confusion.
“I think the characters excite me most about the work. The characters are complicated and complex — children on the brink of adulthood,” O’Donnell said. “We can all relate to their struggles with sexuality, love and familial relationships. Hannah has been extraordinary in being our leader through this complicated work.”
Though the space in Poulton is small, the tech crew has made excellent use of their resources with intricate moving panels and several platforms stationed around the stage to create levels. Just as one actor is used to portray many different roles in this production, the pieces of scenery are equally versatile. The proximity of the audience to the stage doesn’t seem to faze the actors, and one may find oneself staring directly into the face of an outraged German teenager during any one of the large group numbers or feel the gust of wind as a cast member rushes on stage from their entrance behind you. The production team was incredibly resourceful and the fact that the show encompasses the whole theater really amplifies the experience for the audience members.
“Spring Awakening” will take place on Stage III in Poulton Hall April 4 to 6 at 8 p.m., April 7 at 2 p.m. and April 10 to 13 at 8 p.m. Tickets are $8 for students and $12 for general admission and will be available at performingarts.georgetown.edu.

In an attempt to ease the semi-annual preregistration hassle, Students of Georgetown, Inc. launched a beta version of Classy on Tuesday.
Classy is a three-step tool that aims to make the MyAccess system more student-friendly. The class list is easier to read, with course descriptions popping up on the page rather than opening a new page as on MyAccess. Classy creates mock schedules, as many students currently do on computer calendars, based on students’ chosen courses and consolidates courses by class reference number in order to facilitate comparing class times. In addition, class descriptions list faculty evaluation results and contain direct links to MyAccess, course evaluations and Rate My Professor.
“There was a need for a more efficient way to preregister,” Corp Marketing Director Emily Coch (COL ’15) said.
Classy, which was written entirely by The Corp’s Information Technology department, was finalized the week before preregistration began.
According to Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis, the idea for Classy began in November during the University Information Services-hosted Hackathon.
“The Corp’s IT and marketing team has taken the initiative and owned the continued development of the Classy app since the Hackathon,” Davis wrote in an email.
Corp IT General Manager Jonah Joselow (COL ’15) said he hoped that Classy would allow students to focus on the important parts of preregistration.
“It’s quicker,” Joselow said. “The major problem we wanted to solve is that, normally, kids have multiple tabs or windows open and are drawing on paper and a lot of that is removed from what we put together.”
Coch agreed and hoped that the new program would allow students to focus more on the content than scheduling of prospective classes.
According to Davis, The Corp was in constant communication with Provost Robert Groves and University Registrar John Pierce through the developmental process.
“UIS worked with them to help bring together the appropriate stakeholders from across the university to expedite this initial beta launch during the spring preregistration period,” Davis wrote. “I see our role in Classy’s development as an example of UIS’ role to facilitate innovation on Georgetown’s campus.”
So far, Classy has received more than 3,000 unique page views.
“Based on the feedback from social media people seem to be really excited about it,” Joselow said.
Despite this tentative early success, however, Joselow said that the university wanted Classy to be used in conjunction with MyAccess, MyDegree and academic advisers.
“This is uncharted territory for the university,” Joselow said. “They are still formulating how they want this to go.”
Joselow said this first preregistration season would test the beta program’s usefulness and effectiveness, and The Corp would continue working on the design over the next months.
“We are looking forward to working with the university and UIS in specific about future plans,” Joselowsaid.
Christian Chung (SFS ’15) said that Classy helped him preregister faster because it combined information from various websites.
“Quite frankly I think it is something that the school should have attempted to develop a long time ago. I’m surprised that it took The Corp to really spearhead this effort, but regardless, I thought that it was really user-friendly [and] accessible,” Chung said. “The ability to really just centralize that all into one website was really helpful.”
