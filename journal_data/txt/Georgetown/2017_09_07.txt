Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin (SFS ’66, LAW ’69) of Illinois hosted 16 students without documentation on Capitol Hill to express his support after this week’s repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
The students, some of whom were protected under the Obama-era policy, watched from the Senate floor gallery as Durbin delivered a speech advocating for a legislative fix for the so-called “Dreamers,” young adults who were brought to the United States as children and have been living without documentation for years.
“I’m joined this evening by a number of visitors in my office. They are the Dreamers from Georgetown University, my alma mater,” Durbin said on the Senate floor. “I thought it was a pretty big deal when I transferred from St. Louis University to come out here to Georgetown … but what I did was nothing compared to what they have done.”
Durbin’s remarks and invitation come on the heels of Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ announcement Tuesday that the Department of Homeland Security would phase out the DACA program by March 2018, closing the pool to initial applicants and allowing recipients to keep their employment authorization documents until they expire.
Amid uncertainty about how the federal government might shape immigration policy in the coming months, the students discussed the political climate and the legislative conditions under which Congress could attempt to pass the Dream Act of 2017, which would grant deportation reprieve and a pathway to citizenship to young immigrants without documentation.
Sanjuana Castorena (NHS ’21), who is a DACA recipient who attended the discussion, said learning about the bill gave her an optimistic outlook about a possible legislative solution.
“The political climate has always been tense and aggressive with any sort of immigration act or proposal, but this specific moment has left me hopeful,” Castorena said. “I feel more confident in the Dream Act picking up votes and possibly passing, but it would take more movements like calling our representatives from our states to remind them what it’s all about and how important it is.”
Durbin has been an advocate of immigration reform in the Senate since 2001, when he introduced the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, the original DREAM Act. Durbin thinks the political climate could be conducive to pass a bill.
“This may be what we need: We need to have our backs against the wall, a moment of reckoning where we have to go on the record,” Durbin said in an interview with The Hoya. “I can’t guarantee anything — I’ve been around in Congress too long to ever do that — but I feel good that if we can get this measure on the floor, we can pass it.”
The Dream Act has garnered four Republican cosponsors, including Sen. Lisa Murkowski (COL ’80) of Alaska. To attain the 60 votes needed for legislation to overcome a filibuster — a procedural move used by senators to kill a measure — the bill needs eight more Republican supporters, assuming all Democrats vote in favor of it.
A host of other bipartisan legislative measures to grant legal status to Dreamers are also on the docket for this Congress, including the Recognizing America’s Children Act and the American Hope Act.
The White House has signaled its support for the Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment Act, which includes no language regarding students without documentation in its initial form.
Many DACA beneficiaries are concerned about the extent to which the information they have put on their applications will be used for enforcement purposes. The Department of Homeland Security told recipients Tuesday it would not “proactively provide” the data to law enforcement.
However, DHS said it will cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement if requested and where there is “a significant law enforcement or national security interest,” such as gang membership.
In addition to Durbin, several members of the Georgetown community have advocated for a policy that would help Dreamers, with University President John J. DeGioia calling the decision to rescind DACA “unconscionable.”
Juan Martinez (SFS ’20), a DACA enrollee, said the university is supporting students in many ways, including by providing funds for application fees and advising.
“Coming here, I never knew I would receive this much support, and I was surprised,” Martinez said. “It just really reassures me and allows me to pursue my studies first, because I know that I’m going to be supported and that’s something that a lot of undocumented students haven’t had in the past.”
Georgetown has taken steps to institutionalize support for students without documentation, including hiring Arelis Palacios as the university’s first full-time associate director for undocumented student services and creating a website last year to aggregate university resources for this community.
Through a program called Friends of Dreamers, students and faculty have also addressed more than 1,000 letters to members of Congress urging them to support the Dream Act. The letters include a narrative about a Georgetown student living without documentation.
Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming (SFS ’72), who oversees the letter-signing initiative, said it has received overwhelming support in its initial stage and will continue.
“We have to put a face on this legislation, because when you put a face on it it can be very powerful and very convincing, so we intend to continue that campaign,” Fleming said. “I would say to any student who has reasons to question this legislation, … meet a few of the Dreamers on our campus, and I think after you meet these individuals you would be very hard-pressed to not want them to be part of our country.”
Durbin, who has told the stories of over 100 Dreamers on the Senate floor, agrees.
“You can talk about the theory of the law, you can talk about the wording of the law, the reason for the law, but when you start talking about real lives and real stories and real people, it changes the conversation,” Durbin said. “When they hear the story, they understand why we’re doing this.”

Three swastikas were found on the walls of two residence hall elevators this week.
A swastika was found carved onto the wall of a Village C West elevator Tuesday evening, and two swastikas were found painted in red on the inside of an LXR Hall elevator Wednesday evening.
The two cases mark the first bias-related incidents reported on campus this academic year, including one in a freshman dorm less than a week after the first day of classes. The Georgetown University Police Department is investigating both incidents.
A student living in LXR reported the second incident to GUPD Wednesday evening, and the swastikas were removed hours later, according to LXR resident Donovan Taylor (MSB ’20). Vice President for Mission and Ministry Rev. Mark Bosco, S.J., confirmed the second incident in an email Thursday morning.
The incidents mirror a bias-related incident in March, when two swastikas were scratched into a Village C West elevator and later discovered by a Jewish student on the way to class the following morning.
In a campuswide email Wednesday, Vice President for Mission and Ministry Rev. Mark Bosco, S.J., and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson condemned “all acts of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, and any form of hate.”
“These acts are antithetical to our values as a Catholic and Jesuit university and our commitment to be inclusive and welcoming to people of all faiths and racial and ethnic backgrounds,” Bosco and Olson wrote.
In total, at least eight bias-related incidents on and around campus were announced by email to the university community in the 2016-17 academic year. The incidents included anti-Semitic graffiti found near the Makom Jewish gathering space in Leavey Center in May, the removal of Muslim and Hindu flyers from chaplain-in-resident bulletin boards in March and two alleged off-campus assaults on students wearing hijabs in November.
Another incident on March 12 involved a white nationalist group posting white nationalist messages in several locations on and off campus, which were swiftly condemned by student groups and university officials.
Director for Jewish Life Rabbi Rachel Gartner said the vandalisms highlight the hatred of the offenders and applauded the university’s swift response.
“While this cowardly, despicable act of anti-Semitism is a disheartening reminder of the hate we humans are possible of unleashing on one another, the university’s quick, unequivocal and strong condemnation is a heartening reminder that humanity is capable of great love and support too,” Gartner wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In a joint statement, the Georgetown University College Democrats and College Republicans denounced the graffiti as “symbols of hatred and anti-Semitism.”
“In these first weeks of the semester, we remind all Hoyas, especially the new Hoyas, that Georgetown stands for inclusivity and has no place for bigotry,” the statement read.
This week’s incidents come at a time of heightened national concern about an increasingly prominent white nationalist movement. A so-called “Unite the Right” rally in August drew crowds of white nationalist, neo-Confederate and neo-Nazi marchers to Charlottesville, Va., killing one and injuring 19 others on Aug. 12 after a white nationalist plowed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.
University President John J. DeGioia responded to the events in Charlottesville in a letter welcoming students back to campus Aug. 18, saying the community has an “obligation to reject hatred, racism, bigotry, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and all ideologies and manifestations of white nationalism and white supremacy.”

When will GU acknowledge that this isn’t a bunch of bad actors but something ingrained in a large portion of the community? Including our board of directors

Don’t elevators have video cameras?  Has the Hoya asked for a copy of the video?
[…] were both blood red. One was a little smeared; the other had cleaner lines. These were the second and third swastikas found on campus this semester, and this is the second time I have had to start an article for The Hoya by […]

Washington, D.C.’s government will sponsor over 100 art events throughout the city in a monthlong showcase of creativity across the District.
Announced by Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) on Aug. 30, the second annual 202Creates initiative will celebrate arts and cultures in the month of September, with events ranging from this weekend’s 202 Arts and Music Festival to culinary tastings and dance performances.
The initiative is coordinated by the D.C. Office of Cable Television, Film, Music and Entertainment and the D.C. Commission on Arts and Humanities.
According to Chanda Washington, a spokesperson for the District Office of the Deputy Mayor of Planning and Economic Development, 202Creates aims to celebrate “creatives,” or those who are involved in creative jobs and hobbies in the District, and explore how they work to change the perception that the District lacks a cultural scene.
“You think about D.C., you think about the monuments, the Smithsonian, the existing cultural vibrancy that exists in the city. We want to amplify that. We want people to see how it blends within our neighborhoods,” Washington said. “We want people to see how you can take part in it and get a job from it, how you can build on it.”
Jeff Scott, the chief of external affairs for the District’s Commission on the Arts and Humanities, said 202Creates also applauds the creative sector’s wide-reaching impact, with creatives in fields including music and art as well as writing and technology.
Scott also noted the variety of artistic offerings across fields in D.C., highlighting the range of talents across the music, theater, fashion and design industries.
“Some of the goals of it really are to show the different individuals and organizations that are working in these creative fields, and to show within that the great range of different things that are being done. We have such a wide variety of creative and cultural offerings in the city,” Scott said.
Scott said the local government has worked to reach out to all communities in the District this year, coordinate a targeted social media campaign and build on other outreach efforts to ensure that all eight wards of the city can enjoy and take part in the creative economy.
“This is as much an awareness initiative as anything else, I feel — to use the different events and programs that we produce, but to also use social media and outreach to get the information out there,” Scott said. “In becoming aware of it, hopefully they become more active participants and engaged with that.”
Washington also said 202Creates highlights the city’s creative economy. According to Mayor Bowser’s office, creativity is a significant part of the District’s economy, bringing in over 2,400 arts-related businesses and creating over 120,000 jobs in creative sectors, 1,800 of which were added just in the last year, from hairstylists to chefs and graphic artists.
“The creative economy, in essence, is the way we create jobs, the way we grow the economy by using the creative energy that already exists in the city,” Washington said. “We believe that’s some energy that would allow us to pump up our economy and create more jobs for District residents.”
Scott said the creative economy goes beyond employing current District residents to attract potential new businesses and residents to the city, expanding the tax base and improving the overall quality of life.
“Not only are these individuals and professionals doing great work, but their work is contributing to the overall growth and vitality of the city. It’s part of why we think people want to live in D.C.: because we have these sorts of offerings, because we have these arts and humanities offerings, because we have a robust creative sector,” Scott said. “Even if you yourself do not work in that sector, your life is touched by it in some way.”

Washington, D.C., is now the world’s first Platinum-certified environmentally friendly city, according to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Cities program.
Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and Mahesh Ramanujam, president and CEO of the U.S. Green Building Council, announced the honor Aug. 31 at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Shaw, the highest-rated LEED school in the United States.
Developed by the nonprofit U.S. Green Building Council, LEED is an international certification program that rates buildings, homes and neighborhoods based on the environmental responsibility of their design, construction, operation and maintenance.
“We are proud to be recognized as the world’s first LEED Platinum city. Our commitment to these issues will not yield, and we look forward to continuing to build a greener, more resilient, and more sustainable D.C.,” Bowser said.
Launched last year, LEED for Cities applies the USGBC’s signature model to cities, evaluating city performance in categories such as water, waste, energy, transportation and human experience. To receive designation as LEED Platinum, cities must create sustainability goals and submit data for the USGBC to track over time.
The Bowser administration has made environmental sustainability a priority in the District, renewing the city’s commitment to the Paris climate agreement following President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency.
The administration has also developed Climate Ready D.C., an arm of the greater Sustainable D.C. planning project aimed at making the District the most healthy, green and livable city in the United States.
According to the USGBC, D.C. has the most LEED-certified buildings per capita in the United States at 29.04 square feet of LEED space per resident.
“It is in the best interest of Washington, D.C.’s safety, economy, and future to take sustainability and resiliency seriously, and as the nation’s capital, we have a special obligation to lead the way on environmental issues,” Bowser said.
Georgetown University shares a similar commitment to sustainability and seeks to achieve LEED Gold certification for every new building and renovation, according to Office of Sustainability Director Audrey Stewart.
“Georgetown takes an integrated and holistic approach to sustainability, placing value on a ‘quadruple’ bottom line: people, planet, prosperity, and purpose, guided by our Catholic and Jesuit values and our commitment to the common good,” Stewart wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Georgetown currently has eight on-campus LEED-certified buildings including Pedro Arrupe, S.J. Hall and the John R. Thompson Jr. Intercollegiate Athletics Center, totaling 1 million square feet of LEED space.
Gaia Mattiace (COL ’18), Core Pathways fellow and former president of Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network, reiterated the importance of LEED certification to achieving both on-campus and District-wide sustainability goals.
“D.C. becoming the first LEED Platinum city provides us, and the university at-large, with even greater inspiration to pursue more sustainability, energy efficiency, and water conservation projects on campus,” Mattiace wrote in an email to The Hoya. “D.C.’s LEED certification is truly a testament to how we, as a community, are moving more and more towards recognizing the challenges of climate change, pollution, and environmental degradation, as well as the need to rise to the occasion and to make a positive and much needed change.”
