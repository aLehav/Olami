After two years of planning, approval and construction, the university completed renovations on about 22,000 square feet of the Car Barn’s first floor this month, creating a new graduate student lounge and providing space for the Georgetown University Press and the university’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
The new lounge, located in the southwest corner of the building, features custom fabricated floor-to-ceiling glass windows that increase window space by replacing former garage doors. The university also has plans to make further renovations to departmental offices located in the Car Barn.
“We’re trying to accomplish many things. One is it consolidated other lease space to make us more efficient,” Vice President of Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said. “It provided space for graduate student growth, some graduate student common space and study-collaboration space and we’ve also got space in there that we call swing space.”
The new swing space in the Car Barn will be used to temporarily house other programs or departments currently located elsewhere in the Car Barn so that their offices can also be renovated.
“The intent is that we get more efficient,” Morey said. “And in order to do that, you need to move those people somewhere. So we also have a small area that’s for swing space so that we can go in and strategically renovate other parts of the Car Barn in the future.”
One of the major drivers of the renovation project, according to Morey, was GU Press’ expiring lease at its previous office location, 3240 Prospect St. NW. The lease expired in November and the GU Press staff moved into the Car Barn on Nov. 21.
When the Car Barn’s owner, Douglas Development Corporation, listed space on the first floor of the building about two years ago, the university negotiated a contract to lease it. At the time, Douglas Development was also attempting to attract a retailer to the available first-floor space.
Prior to Georgetown’s lease two years ago, the university was using the first floor of Car Barn as garage space, according to Morey.
Alongside the student lounge, the Government Master’s program in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences relocated its offices to the newly renovated Car Barn space from the Intercultural Center. The increased space for the Graduate School falls in line with the university’s plan to increase the size of the Graduate School over the next two decades.
“The university has aspirations to expand the Graduate School,” Morey said. “If you look at our campus plan, we’re looking to grow our graduate program over the next 10 to 20 years by 2,000 students. At least, that’s what we requested in the plan and have approved. So, obviously those folks need a home.”
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Norberto Grzywacz said the complex nature of issues that graduate students study requires collaborative work, which the newly renovated space in the Car Barn helps to stimulate.
“In addition, the design of the new space will encourage these unique programs to interact with each other,” Grzywacz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Thus, the new space is an essential part of an important innovation in higher education.  This innovation turns a good portion of a university scholarly production outwards towards society.”
According to proposals submitted in November 2016 to the Old Georgetown Board, an advisory committee of architects appointed by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, a federal entity, the Graduate School also plans to add signage to the M Street and Prospect Street entrances to the Car Barn reading, “Georgetown University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.”
Georgetown University Press Publicity and Exhibits Manager Jackie Beilhart said the new GU Press office is a step up from the former space. Not only is the new office closer to campus, but it includes an elevator, unlike the former lease. Furthermore, Beilhart said that the university made sure to modify the office to ensure higher-than-average air quality.
“Since the space is brand new, it’s definitely very nice and very well put-together whereas our last place hadn’t been renovated in a bit,” Beilhart said. “Certainly, just having a new place in general has been really lovely.”

University officials are working to assess how the Georgetown community would be impacted by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Friday, which temporarily bans citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States.
A report compiled by the university registrar’s office provided to The Hoya identified about 20 undergraduate students currently at Georgetown on student visas who are citizens of the seven countries named in the order: Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Libya.
According to a summary of the order compiled by university staff, these students will not be able to re-enter the United States if they leave during the 90-day ban. University President John DeGioia expressed his concern about the ban in a campuswide email Jan. 29.
“The implications of this order are significant and concerning,” DeGioia said. “We are an institution that values the contributions of our international students, staff and faculty, and we are deeply committed to interreligious dialogue and providing a context in which members of all faith backgrounds are welcomed and encouraged to practice their faith.”
Media Relations Manager Ryan King said none of the students are currently overseas and the university is not aware of any students abroad who may be unable to return. He added that the university may not yet fully understand the implications of the order.
“We are continuing to examine the effect of the Executive Order on the Georgetown community,” King wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In addition to the seven-nation entry ban, the executive order also bans admission of refugees from all countries for 120 days and the migration of Syrian refugees indefinitely. The order applies to about 800 refugees who had already cleared a multi-step vetting process that can take as long as two years, according to a report by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.
The order has received condemnation from Georgetown administrators, faculty and student groups. In an email on Sunday to the School of Foreign Service faculty obtained by The Hoya, SFS Dean Joel Hellman wrote that the order challenges the values of the SFS.
“There is the risk to our community members who will be directly impacted by the ban,” Hellman wrote. “More broadly, there is the challenge to the very values upon which the SFS was created and for which we have championed for nearly a century.”
Professor Charles King, who is the chair of the government department, said in an email Sunday obtained by The Hoya forwarding Hellman’s email to government department faculty that the department will work to support all students and faculty affected by the order.
“The idea of a wholesale ban on travel from particular countries, as well as the specific association of national security and a cultural-religious category -— implicit in the executive order, explicit in the public rhetoric — are inimical to the professed values of this university,” King wrote. “We will continue to support and protect all members of our community, regardless of their status.”
The Georgetown University Student Association senate passed a resolution Sunday expressing solidarity with Muslim students and refugees.
“We condemn the Executive Order on refugees and travel from Muslim-majority countries issued by President Trump on January 27th,” the resolution reads. “We urge the University to provide all necessary resources to support any Georgetown University community member who is affected adversely by this Order.”
In a statement posted to the group’s Facebook page, the Georgetown University College Republicans Executive Board denounced the order.
“Although we understand the grave threats that our country faces from radical Islamist terrorism, we do not believe that security should trump humanity.” the statement reads. “Our Board believes that this policy will debilitate our international credibility and will isolate pivotal allies who are crucial to the war on terror.”
The Georgetown University College Democrats later shared the College Republicans’ Facebook post, writing in a post that the group was “so proud” to be working alongside them.
“Trump’s recent executive actions on immigration and refugee asylum are not issues of partisanship — these actions constitute grave violations of our country’s founding principles and encapsulate the cruel effects on a government whose policies are guided by fear, power and bigotry,” the statement reads.
After hundreds of refugees and others flying to the United States were detained at airports across the country over the weekend, protests and legal action have emerged in cities and airports nationwide.
The Trump administration has held firm on the order, although the seven-nation entry ban was walked back Sunday after significant backlash to no longer include legal permanent residents. In a statement posted to his Facebook page, Trump said the order is necessary to protect American citizens.
“America is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border. America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave,” the statement reads.
Research professor Elizabeth Ferris, who is also a senior fellow at the think-tank Brookings Institution and has written about refugees, said the order is misguided, as refugees are not a security threat and current vetting procedures are already strong.
“There is this misguided notion that refugees are somehow terrorists or linked to terrorists, and yet the reality is that these are people who are fleeing violence,” Ferris said. “They’re not a threat. The vetting procedures that have been put into place the last couple years are extreme. We’ve protested for a year that they’re too much, that the delays are too long.”
Government professor Andrew Bennett, who specializes in American foreign policy, said he is concerned about the impacts the order will have on the United States’ standing in the world.
“I share the concern of foreign policy professionals and terrorism experts in both parties,” Bennett wrote in an email to The Hoya. “President Trump’s hasty executive order on immigration, and the haphazard decision process behind it, are damaging to American interests and the fight against terrorism.”
[…] January, DeGioia led the university’s efforts against the travel ban, currently being challenged in the Supreme Court by refugee rights organizations and others […]

In his first week as President of the United States, Donald Trump has changed how the White House communicates to the American people through his frequent tweeting and direct rebuking of media outlets.
In light of this new political landscape, the McCourt School of Public Policy’s Institute of Politics and Public Service’s spring class of fellows, which includes political journalists, advisers and leaders, hope to develop a better understanding of what Trump’s presidency means for American democracy moving forward.
The fourth class of fellows includes Marolon Marshall, former director of state campaigns and political engagement for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, President of Americans for Tax Reform Grover Norquist, Senior Washington Correspondent and co-author of Politico Playbook Anna Palmer, Jen Psaki, who served as director of communications and senior advisor to former President Barack Obama and a media consultant for the 2016 Trump campaign, Tony Sayegh.
In an interview with The Hoya on Friday, the incoming class of GU Politics fellows shared their thoughts on the recent campaign, the implications of Trump’s communication methods and how they plan to use their discussion sessions with students to learn about the perspectives of the younger generations.
Why did you each decide to join this fellowship?
Marshall: Honestly, to get a chance to learn from the students. We are in an interesting time right now in our politics in this country and to learn — obviously, we have had our own political experiences that we want to share — but to really learn from how students are experiencing it and also how to communicate now in this new world. Hearing from students at an institution like Georgetown is going to be really helpful for everyone as we plan moving forward.
Sayegh: There is a lot we can learn from this process. We are practitioners, we clearly talk to a lot of colleagues and friends, but there are so many open questions that to get the input of the next generation of people doing what we are doing in the world of politics and public policy and public service would be terrific. For my part, as well, I was always the beneficiary of great mentoring.
Psaki: It is easy to become jaded and to only listen to the same voices in our political system, and I was drawn to this because it provided an opportunity to hear from fresh and new voices in the student body. I’ve already learned a lot from just the last 24 hours.
Palmer: It gives me time to take a break from the fast pace news cycle of every day … and really reflect a little bit on what’s happened and what is happening, and try to make sense of what is happening in the world and get a broader perspective from the people around this table, as well as the students, in terms of what the dialogue is going to look like.
You all mentioned you wanted to learn from the students. What do you have planned during the year to try and incorporate that process?
Palmer: From my perspective, the way I plan on setting up the lectures and the discussion groups is as less of a lecture and more of a really interactive thing.
Psaki: The focus of my discussion group is social media — the good, the bad and the unknown. There’s no question that students at Georgetown probably have a perception on this, in terms of what tools should government campaigns be using, what isn’t working, how to reach people with all the range of platforms out there.
We are also going to spend a fair amount of time talking about the dangers the use of propaganda.
Sayegh: My discussion group looks at the entire event of the 2016 campaign and tries to in a retrospective way understand what happened, and the short-term and long-term implications.
It is great to bring in practitioners from both sides because this is a conversation which is happening among all the people in our world — whether it’s the policy or the media or the politics world or campaign world.
Marshall: My discussion is on organizing and social justice, looking at how the public’s voice in coming together around certain social justice issues throughout the history of our country has really pushed those issues forward.
With regard to this recent campaign season, what were your thoughts about the how communications have changed during this campaign and what we have seen in these past two weeks with the White House communications team?
Psaki: What we saw through the campaign – one of the opportunities in social media and the expansion of platforms –  is that there are a lot of new ways to reach people, and clearly the Trump campaign and Donald Trump took advantage of that and spoke directly to the American people.
Palmer: We’ve seen that for Trump, Twitter is the new bully pulpit. He doesn’t feel he needs the traditional media to get his message across to his supporters. We’re at a point where the media is really in a period of a new development in terms of how they’re going to handle this White House and how they’re going to handle facts and fiction and lies. It’s going to be a process that’s going to develop, and there’s going to be some speedbumps along the way.
Sayegh: No matter what tactical tools or communication tools you have, if you’re not winning the argument, it’s very hard to win the election. It all goes back to the candidate and the message and people’s belief in the message and the person obviously selling it.
To a large degree, and why you’re seeing alternative communications coming out of this White House as far as the president’s own Twitter handle and expanding the pool that covers the president.
That’s actually a major discussion we’re going to be having — the long-term impact on journalism. Are we entering a new world where it’s not just about objective journalism anymore?
I do think you have a president who very much believes it’s his job to communicate to the American people directly.
Going forward, do you think President Trump’s campaign and White House strategy of direct communication will result in a permanent change to the U.S. political climate, or do you think this will be unique to Trump?
Sayegh: You’ve perfectly encapsulated the theme of my discussion group — I don’t know. I don’t think any of us really know.
The one lesson I’ve learned after nearly 500 campaigns since I was 17 is, when you win, you didn’t do everything right and when you lose, you didn’t do everything wrong.
Psaki: Campaigns are aspirational, that’s true for every candidate who’s ever run for president. You can say lots of things and not back it up with action from Congress with the ability to actually get it done.
Governing is real and it’s harder than people think it is, bringing coalitions together is harder than people think it is, getting laws passed is harder. President Trump promised a lot of things to a lot of people, so now this isn’t about whether your tweets go viral, it’s about whether you deliver on the promises and how that impacts people in the country.
Marshall: I do think you’ll see more people running for office who may not have run before, on both sides. Like, “Okay, I have all these different tools now, I can just put my phone towards trying to get my message out.” Which, I think, is frankly good for democracy that people just say, “I’m just going to jump in and run for city commissioner or mayor or something.” I think this election on both sides will get more people to get involved in the process.

The Georgetown University Student Association senate passed two resolutions Sunday pertaining to last semester’s referendum that sought to abolish the GUSA senate and replace it with an elected assembly primarily responsible for allocating club funding.
The first resolution, drafted by GUSA senator Jasmine Ouseph (SFS ’19) and GUSA senate speaker Richie Mullaney (COL ’18), clarified that GUSA bylaws concerning elections apply to referendum campaigns and established impartial voting stations run by the GUSA Election Commission.
The second resolution allows GUSA senator Scott Lowder (COL ’17) and Owen Hayes (SFS ’18), GUSA’s finance and appropriations committee chairman, to continue their  process of appealing the Constitutional Council’s enjoinment of the referendum results, which began in December.
Focusing on the results of December’s senate restructuring and club funding reform referendum, the first resolution addresses the aftermath of voting results that were initially withheld by the Constitutional Council following six members of the Vote No campaign filing complaints of electioneering on the evening of Dec. 1.
Six members of the Vote No campaign filed a complaint on the evening of Dec. 1 alleging GUSA violated its own bylaws by attempting to influence students to vote in favor of the referendum and by not properly presenting the amendment to the student body with enough time.
Passing unanimously with all 20 senators voting for the resolution to change the bylaws, the resolution addressed complaints that alleged GUSA’s violation of its own bylaws by attempting to sway students toward the referendum as well as by preventing students from having ample time with the proposed amendment’s points.
The restructuring referendum results were later determined invalid Jan. 20 on the grounds that GUSA violated its own constitution by not properly presenting the amendment to the student body at least two weeks prior to the referendum. The Constitutional Council found GUSA not guilty on all counts involving electioneering and improper campaigning.
The complaints originated with GUSA senators Ouseph, Isaac Liu (COL ’20) and Charles Hajjar (MSB ’20), GUSA Free Speech Policy Team chair D.J. Angelini (MSB ’17), GUSA Dining and Auxiliary Services Policy Team chair Mark Camilli (COL ’19) and Dylan Hughes (COL ’19), who is unaffiliated with GUSA.
In addition to filing his appeal, Lowder also said the first resolution helps clarify confusion from the referendum campaign.
“We can have official voting stations that are unbiased, nonpartisan and made clear that voting stations by any campaign would not be allowed,” Lowder said.
GUSA Senator Jack Pelose (COL ’19) said at the meeting this resolution addresses many causes of biased electioneering, including limited enforcement of existing rules regarding tabling.
The university’s free speech and expression policy allows tabling only in designated areas, including public squares and certain locations outside of Lauinger Library, Henle Village, Darnall Hall and the Healey Family Student Center.
The second resolution that required for Lowder and Hayes to submit the appeal, however, passed on Sunday with a vote of 14 to two with four abstentions. GUSA president Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and vice president Chris Fisk (COL ’17) chose not to appeal the Jan. 20 Constitutional Council decision.
According to Lowder, the Constitutional Council will consider the motion this week.
“In terms of the appeal, because the Constitutional Council ruled on an issue that was only brought up on the day of the hearing and not in the original complaint, it’s in the interest of all parties to completely litigate this issue and make sure we have a clear and concrete ruling moving forward,” Lowder said.
At Sunday’s meeting, Lowder also said the appeal, entitled a motion for reconsideration, is not intended to force another referendum on the restructuring of club funding.
“The larger issue is that looking for past Constitutional Council decisions are very hard to find and there’s not a lot of involvement,” Lowder said. “A more precise written explanation for why they did what they did would be better for all parties involved.”
GUSA Senator Isaac Liu (COL ’20) said he does not believe the Constitutional Council’s decision is worth appealing.
“It’s time to move beyond this issue and accept the Constitutional Council’s rule,” Liu said. “And I think we should think about what the general student body is going to think if this drags on.”
GUSA Senator Evan Farrara (COL ’19) said the appeal should be allowed as long as the Constitutional Council realizes that it is coming from an individual and not the senate as a whole.
“People are saying that if senator Lowder goes ahead with this appeal he is acting on behalf of the senate and I don’t think that’s true. Since he has as a student the right to appeal, he can do so,” Farrara said. “I don’t think his appeal is valid just because this Constitutional Council has the right to interpret the bylaws as they see fit. But I still think he has the right to appeal.”

The 44th annual march drew thousands of anti-abortion activists to gather on the National Mall and march to the Supreme Court on Friday. Vice President Mike Pence was the first vice president ever to address activists at the annual March for Life.
The march also marked the first in eight years to be held under an anti-abortion president. Just five days earlier, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to bar foreign non-governmental organizations that perform or promote abortions from receiving federal funding.
Pence spoke at noon before the march, vowing to end federally funded
abortion nationwide. He also promised that Trump will soon announce a Supreme Court nominee to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia (CAS ’57) last February.
In addition to Pence, Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway also addressed the crowd.
Conway, who has recently drawn criticism for her support of the new administration’s use of “alternative facts,” spoke about her hope for the anti-abortion movement during the Trump administration.
“This is a new day, a new dawn for life,” Conway said.  “This dismissive notion of out of sight, out of mind is over. Science and medicine have joined religion and morality in causing many Americans to rethink just how fragile and how triumphant human life truly is.”
Those who gathered at the march came from various backgrounds, from religious clerics to students attending on school trips.
Some who had marched in year’s past, like Fr. Gabriel Zeis, a Catholic chaplain from Princeton University, said this year’s march felt noticeably different.
“There is a greater energy this year. People are motivated to think that we possibly have a stronger voice today than we ever had before in the Capitol,” Zeis said.
Many at the March for Life, including Zeis, largely agreed that Planned Parenthood should be defunded, halting all federal funding to the nonprofit that focuses on providing reproductive health services and resources such as contraceptives, family planning services and abortions.
“Planned Parenthood is a flawed system. No one has ever taken a close look at it. The national conversation has to be around developing a good program that’s going to care for women but not allow for abortions,” Zeis said.
A week earlier, at the Women’s March on Washington, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards spoke about her resolve to keep the organization functional and providing services.
“Today we are here to deliver a message. We will not take this lying down,” Richards said. “You need to call your Senator and say we cannot go back. Together we are a movement and we are unstoppable.”
Georgetown’s pro-abortion rights group, H*yas for Choice, protested at the march, releasing a statement that Trump’s recent policies affect large groups of people.
“We viewed this as an opportunity to register our dissent with the anti-choice values the march promotes, and to show our continued support for abortion access nationwide,” the statement reads. “These policies will endanger the lives and well-being of millions of people in jeopardy, particularly people of color, people with disabilities, low-income people and people living in rural communities.”
H*yas for Choice also addressed its goals for the club and university, prioritizing HIV and sexually transmitted infections screening, access to free menstrual hygiene products, increased access to contraception and better quality care at the Student Health Center.
The group also called for Georgetown University to maintain the minimum standards for contraceptive coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act, which dictates that contraceptive methods and counseling for all women be provided by plans in the health insurance market.
“Despite this volatile national climate, we will continue to move Georgetown in a progressive direction,” the statement reads.
Georgetown University Right to Life, an anti-abortion rights group, sent about 40 members to participate in the march.
GU Right to Life President Amelia Irvine (COL ’19) said her hope is that the Trump administration’s changes are accompanied by legislation and the appointment of an anti-abortion justice to the Supreme Court.
“One day, I hope that the preborn will enjoy the same rights as every American, and that will only happen when Roe v. Wade is recognized by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional and overturned,” Irvine wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Mike Baker, a northern Illinois resident who travelled to the District for the march, mentioned he was particularly hopeful that Trump’s Supreme Court nominee would work to overturn Roe v. Wade and defund Planned Parenthood.
“The court has been very progressive in things that it hasn’t had to,” Baker said. “The court has forced my children to grow up in a society where marriage has been redefined, which in my opinion, is not their job.”
Rosemary Battle, the president of Students for Life at Michigan State University, said that she hoped to see abortion become separate from religion.
“I hope that the next Supreme Court Justice realizes that this isn’t just a religious issue, that it is definitely a science issue,” Battle said.  “Being pro-life means you have realized that it is an individual that is conceived. It’s not just part of the woman, it’s actually its own being.”

Thank you Tait Ryssdal for helping to make the term “anti-abortion” the correct definition of those who oppose abortion. As a supporter of a women’s choice to choose to have an abortion, I am also not “pro-abortion” (which semantically would be the opposite of “anti-abortion), just as I am not “anti-life.” (Is there anyone anti-life? I guess if one were suicidal, they would be.)  One suggestion I do have is that instead of describing someone as “pro-abortion rights” (because that still has that “pro-abortion terminology), perhaps describe them as an abortion rights advocate or proponent of abortion rights. Thank you again for a very well-written account of the March for Life.

The Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department released a surveillance video and photograph Sunday of a suspect wanted in connection to the kidnapping of a Georgetown student that occurred Thursday on the 3400 block of O St., NW.
On Jan. 26, at approximately 3:20 p.m., the suspect forced the victim, an unidentified student, into a light gray or silver colored sport utility vehicle and drove away.
The suspect forced the victim to attempt to withdraw money from an ATM and make large purchases at retail locations in the District and Maryland. The victim was released unharmed.
MPD describes the suspect as a white male in his late 30s to 40s, 5’9” to 6’0” tall, of medium build, dark colored hair, mustache and beard. He was wearing a black suit, black shirt, gray necktie and black shoes.
GUPD informed the university community of the kidnapping in an email Jan. 27 at about 1:30 p.m., saying they would coordinate with MPD to increase surveillance in the West Georgetown neighborhood. MPD is also offering a $1,000 reward to any individual who provides information that leads to the arrest of the suspect.
Sydney te Wildt (COL ’20) said she was stunned by the news of a student being kidnapped.
“Living in such an affluent neighborhood provides us with such a false sense of security,” te Wildt said. “Though Georgetown is incredibly safe, there are still dangerous people out there, even during the day.”
[…] male suspect accused of kidnapping a Georgetown student last January pled guilty to assault with intent to commit robbery Nov. 2, as part of a plea agreement with […]

The university has recruited third-party mediator Don Edwards, Justice and Sustainability Associates’ CEO, to assist in the negotiations between Georgetown and Nike regarding the university’s licensing contract, which expired Dec. 31.
Georgetown let the licensing contract expire following the 35-hour sit-in of President John J. DeGioia’s suite of offices staged by members of workers’ rights group the Georgetown Solidarity Committee on Dec. 8 and 9.
At the conclusion of the sit-in, the university’s administration agreed not to renew the contract with Nike unless the company commits to allowing full, independent access to the Worker Rights Consortium, Georgetown’s preferred independent factory monitoring organization. According to the agreement, Nike either has to sign Georgetown’s Code of Conduct for University Licensees or establish its own code of conduct on par with the university code’s standards.
GSC member Lily Ryan (COL ’18), who participated in the sit-in, said that the university should be congratulated for not renewing the contract, but they should not have continued the negotiations or hired Edwards given the real impact Nike’s labor practices have on people who work in its factories worldwide. Ryan also sits on the Licensing Oversight Committee, which advises the university on its licensing contracts.
“The fact that they decided they needed to bring in a mediator is very telling,” Ryan said. “To me it’s another tactic to stall the conversations, redirect GSC members, redirect LOC members who are really concerned about this and see this as an urgent problem.”
Georgetown’s Senior Director of Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said the university explored independent mediation to help with the negotiations process when the contract expired. The university’s athletic sponsorship with Nike remains and is separate from the licensing contract.
According to Pugh, Edwards met with the LOC last week to better understand the members’ goals. She also said the university believes the mediator should help ensure that an agreement is reached that both secures timely, independent access for the WRC and upholds the university’s code of conduct.
“Georgetown believes that principled and practical engagement is the best way to ensure the safety, welfare and rights of workers around the globe,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown is positioned to champion human dignity and is committed to seeking solutions that provide meaningful results in the lives and communities of workers.”
Ryan said the meeting offered no new information in terms of a timeline for the negotiations with Nike going forward or stated if there is a point at which the university will abandon its efforts to reach an agreement.
“From the mediator they brought in, he was kind of like, ‘We’re going to do this until we find a consensus or determine that there is no way forward,’” Ryan said. “To me, that could be infinitely long and the university has been negotiating with Nike for over a year, so I’m not sure what they’re expecting to change.”
According to international business diplomacy professor John Kline, who is also a member of the LOC, hiring a mediator will further prolong negotiations that have already lasted longer than a year.
“The appalling failure of Nike audits to recognize widespread worker abuse at Vietnam’s Hansae factory, its attempt to dismiss worker protests as a ‘misunderstanding’ and its stonewalling of WRC factory access for a year while abuses continued should disqualify Nike as a Georgetown corporate partner rather than gain it more exceptional treatment,” Kline wrote in an email to The Hoya.
While the university continues its negotiations with Nike using the mediator, the members of GSC who continued the sit-in overnight await the results of their conduct hearing.
On the first day of the sit-in, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson signed a letter that eight students received, outlining that the students violated the university’s Code of Student Conduct in failing to comply with instructions to vacate private property.
The students met with Dean of Students Jeanne Lord on Jan. 18 and Jan. 19, where they defended their actions but did not deny them.
“There’d been no progress made, and we felt that it was our duty to do something,” Ryan said. “To us, the code of conduct is a living document and not every situation will fit nicely and neatly into every box of every charge.”
A day before the hearings began, the eight students filed a complaint to the Speech and Expression Committee. The complaint states that any disciplinary action against the students in reaction to the sit-in would be a violation of their freedom of expression.
“It was our responsibility to do this, and we think it would be unjust to impose any sanctions, particularly given the whole thing is about a code of conduct and it’s so interesting that Georgetown is so excited to enforce this code of conduct and not the labor code of conduct,” Ryan said. “That’s just a nice irony that we all are mindful of.”

The 2017 Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life, the largest student-organized anti-abortion conference in the United States, focused on “working toward a truly pro-life politics,” Saturday in Healy and Gaston Halls.
The conference, launched in 2000, has taken place annually at Georgetown in tandem with the Washington, D.C. March for Life. Vice President Mike Pence spoke at this year’s March for Life on Friday, in the first speech by a president or vice president at the rally ever.
The conference is named in honor of Cardinal John O’Connor, who served as Cardinal of New York until his death in 2000. O’Connor earned a doctorate in political science from the School of Foreign Service in 1970. He dedicated his life primarily to advocacy for the preservation of human life, and he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal shortly before his death.
The event, co-directed by Jeannette Joly (COL ’17) and Michael Khan (COL ’18), was intended to contemplate the basic foundations of the anti-abortion stance and to examine the consequences of political engagement in issues of life and choice at both national and international levels.
Held a day after the march instead of its usual scheduling beforehand, the conference included several speakers, a panel discussion, three breakout sessions, the presentation of an award named after former Georgetown theology professor Thomas King, S.J. and a concluding Mass.
Reggie Littlejohn, founder and president of anti-forced abortion group Women’s Rights Without Frontiers, offered this year’s keynote address.
In a panel discussion during the conference, John Carr, director of the Georgetown University Catholic Social Thought Initiative, said the anti-abortion movement must continue to build on the legacy it has established.
“We have a lot to be proud of. For 45 years, we have kept this cause alive in the face of the elites of every continent telling us it was over. But we’re not where we want to be. And we need to do a better job,” Carr said.
During the panel discussion, Carr said it is important young people remain involved in the anti-abortion rights movement.
“You must be really tired of old people telling you how great it is to have young people in the pro-life movement, leading it — always, the best part of the March for Life,” Carr said.
GU Right to Life Vice President MyLan Metzger (COL ’19), who served as co-director of outreach for the conference, said the conference aligns with Georgetown’s Jesuit values.
“The Conference is important because it promotes intellectual discussion about a variety of topics dealing with human life,” Metzger wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think the Conference is a perfect reflection of Georgetown’s Jesuit values, including its striving for academic excellence, and faith and justice.”
The conference attracted a protest from H*yas for Choice, Georgetown’s unrecognized pro-abortion rights student group.
The group protested each stage of the conference, according to H*yas for Choice Co-Presidents Emily Stephens (SFS ’17) and Brinna Ludwig (NHS ’17). The group tabled outside the front gates all day and chanted throughout the day.
The group also published blog posts the week before the conference explaining its rationale for protesting.
H*yas for Choice member Kory Stuer (COL ’19) said the conference represents regressive values.
“We feel that this conference is just an inexcusable affront to the Georgetown community, because it represents a kind of hatred and bigotry in a lot of different ways, and a lot of just retrogressive values that we don’t feel really belong on this campus,” Stuer said.
Stuer said that, in spite of the objections to the conference taken by H*yas for Choice, he and other pro-abortion rights students have made attempts at dialogue and direct engagement with anti-abortion rights students.
“We’re willing to approach dialogue and approach working together, but we haven’t really seen any signs that that’s coming from a place of good faith,” Stuer said. “We’re not interested in political gestures; we’re interested in things that mean something.”
Metzger said GU Right to Life is also committed to engaging in dialogue with groups with differing opinions.
“We are committed to the free expression of ideas, even if they may disagree with our own,” Metzger wrote. “For this reason, the Conference reserved Copley Lawn for anyone who wanted to express their criticism of the Conference. However, we would have loved to have critics ask questions at our panel and breakout sessions, rather than chant about how “‘Right to Life has got to go.’”

Rallies have surfaced at Washington, D.C. area airports in protest of President Donald Trump’s Jan. 28 executive order that bans entry into the United States for citizens hailing from seven Muslim-majority countries.
The order, titled “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,” prohibits individuals from entering the United States from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days, and bans individuals entering the nation from Syria indefinitely.
Although the Department of Homeland Security initially said the order included banning those holding a valid visa or green card, they rescinded that statement and said that by Sunday evening, 392 green card holders received waivers to enter the country.
Protests at Washington Dulles International Airport began Saturday evening and were arranged by an organization aiming to involve white Americans in racial justice causes, Showing Up for Racial Justice.
Chanting demonstrators at Dulles offered travelers arriving from foreign countries food, directions and other resources. The demonstrators were joined by teams of lawyers, waiting to assist travelers in need, and even Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).
SURJ Organizer Cayce Utley said the rally was important to the organization because of the fear they had seen among the Muslim community since the ban was implemented.
“We spoke with some of our colleagues who are already working on this from a Muslim-led point of view, and we discussed with them whether or not it would be helpful to mobilize over the weekend at Dulles,” Utley said. “There’s been legal support and a greeting squad greeting people who are coming off of the international flights. We’re just trying to offer moral support in any way we can.”
Aniqa Raihan, a senior at the George Washington University, is planning a continuation of the protests at Reagan National Airport on Wednesday. She emphasized the personal importance of continued protests, as she is the child of Muslim immigrants to the U.S.
“I am a human being with compassion and respect for my fellow people,” Raihan said. “I believe in the rights of refugees and in the dignity and value of immigrants. It has always been important to fight for the rights of people who aren’t yourself or your family, but it is especially important now as fear tests our collective commitment to justice.”
However, some feel that the protests are an extreme reaction to Trump’s order. Jared Horne (COL ’19) noted that other presidents have capped refugee admissions to the U.S., but did not receive the public objections that Trump has.
“The fact that multiple presidents in the past have done the same, and they’re yelling that he’s a racist for it? They’re hating Trump just to hate Trump,” Horne said. “They don’t look at what’s happened in the past. They’re just creating more of a diverge between Republicans and Democrats. If it was Obama saying this, I don’t believe that they would be protesting.”

Republicans in Congress this week have made a step forward in overturning Washington, D.C. legislation regarding abortion and physician-assisted suicide.
On Thursday, the House of Representatives voted 238-183 in favor of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, which officially prohibits the use of all federal taxpayer dollars to fund abortion services nationwide. The act also prohibits local D.C. tax dollars from funding abortion services, except in the case of sexual assault, incest or endangerment to the life of the mother.
11 representatives abstained from voting. Those who voted in favor of the bill included three Democrats. No Republicans voted against the legislation.
Encouraged by President Donald Trump’s anti-abortion stance, Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) reintroduced the bill Jan. 1, having introduced it in both 2013 and 2015. Smith said the bill is part of an ongoing effort to reverse the legalization of abortion across the nation.
“Someday, future generations of Americans will look back and wonder how and why such a seemingly smart and enlightened society could have permitted over 60 million children to be exterminated by abortion, often with government enabling and subsidy,” Smith said when introducing the legislation on the Senate floor.
After D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) signed the District’s Death with Dignity Act on Dec. 19 and submitted it for Congressional review on Jan. 6, Republicans in Congress began efforts to dismantle it.
The act allows doctors to prescribe lethal doses of drugs to terminally ill patients with less than six months to live, under the condition that patients make two verbal requests for the treatment, separated by at least 15 days, to a physician and submit a written request at least 48 hours before the medication is dispensed. There must also be at least two witnesses to the written request who can attest that the patient is acting voluntarily and not being pressured to sign the form.
On Jan. 12, Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Texas) introduced a resolution of disapproval to overturn the act. Wenstrum said he proposed the resolution as a protective measure for the sanctity and dignity of human life, as well as a method of ensuring federal tax dollars will not fund physician-assisted suicide.
“America must be a nation that supports and cherishes human life, no matter the age, ethnicity or health of that life,” Lankford wrote in a press release. “Washington, D.C.’s assisted suicide bill would erode our culture’s respect for life, and possibly lead to the mistreatment and exploitation of the disabled and most vulnerable among us.”
Senator James Lankford (R-Okla.) proposed similar legislation in the Senate.
Though congressional leaders rarely block District legislation, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) also said he would use his authority as the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to prevent the Death with Dignity Act from reaching the floor of the House for debate.
D.C.’s nonvoting Congressional delegate Representative Eleanor Norton Holmes (D-D.C.) condemned the actions of congressional Republicans on Thursday, stating that they were violating the Home Rule Act of 1973, which grants District officials the liberty to govern over local affairs.
“It is truly remarkable that instead of using the Committee’s time to conduct appropriate oversight on federal matters, including the new administration, Republicans have chosen to abuse the Committee’s authority over the District of Columbia and meddle with our city’s purely local affairs,” Norton wrote in a press release.
Georgetown University Right to Life President Amelia Irvine (COL ’19) said Right to Life stands with congressional leaders in their efforts to block abortion subsidies and physician-assisted suicide, citing a Marist College poll that found 61 percent of Americans oppose tax dollars being used to pay for abortions.
“We also applaud efforts by members of Congress to reverse the controversial D.C. legislation that legalized assisted suicide last year,” Irvine wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We believe that Congress is acting within its rights to defend life however it can in the District of Columbia.”

Amending Colorado’s Prop 106 is sorely needed.  The initiative was bought for $8,000,000 of deception.  Even as they proclaimed that the poison must be self administered they did not provide for an ordinary witness.  The difference is that without a witness it allows forced euthanasia but with a witness they would up hold individual choice.
Amendments would include requiring a witness to the self administration, restore the illegality of falsifying the death certificate require the posting of the poison applied in the medical record for the sake of good stewardship for future studies, register organ/tissue trafficking, reveal commissions and memorials paid to the corporate facilitators and keep all records for transparent public safety policy.

At least four university alumni are slated to join President Donald Trump’s administration as he continues to assemble his cabinet in the weeks following his Jan. 20 inauguration.
The recently-confirmed Secretary of Homeland Security General John Kelly (GRD ’84), Office of Management and Budget Director-designate Rep. John Mulvaney (R-S.C.) (SFS ’89), Secretary of the Navy-nominee Philip Bilden (SFS ’86) and Robert Lighthizer (CAS ’69 , LAW ’73), who has been nominated to serve as a special trade representative, are all positioned to become part of the Trump administration.
The number of Georgetown-affiliated Trump team members is expected to grow, according to Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming.
“There no doubt will be others as the process moves forward,” Fleming wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Lighthizer is the only undergraduate alum appointed to a cabinet-level position. In a Jan. 3 statement announcing Lighthizer as the pick for special trade representative, Trump said Lighthizer has the experience necessary to handle trade negotiations with other nations.
“Ambassador Lighthizer is going to do an outstanding job representing the United States as we fight for good trade deals that put the American worker first,” Trump said. “He has extensive experience striking agreements that protect some of the most important sectors of our economy, and has repeatedly fought in the private sector to prevent bad deals from hurting Americans.”
Lighthizer’s stance on free trade aligns with that of Trump, who said in the statement he is confident Lighthizer will be successful as USTR.
“He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity,” Trump said.
The senate has yet to schedule Lighthizer’s hearing.
Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said that Georgetown alumni often serve in presidential administrations.
“Georgetown produces dedicated public servants and we’re honored to have a number of alumni serve during each Administration,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to sociology professor William Daddio, this trends have continued to grow over the past two decades.
“In the last 20 years there has been a strong and growing connection between the federal government and Georgetown,” Daddio said. “Georgetown in general, and especially the law school and the School of Foreign Service Master’s in Security Studies, is very influential in preparing people for senior government officials.”
There is also potential for university faculty to begin work with the new president as part of the administration. In a Dec. 14 interview with Jacob Brogan of Slate, government and international relations professor Matthew Kroenig said he would be open to the possibility of working with the Trump administration despite criticizing the President’s foreign policy platform in the past.
In March 2016, Kroenig joined over 100 other Republican policy experts in signing a letter condemning Trump’s foreign policy platform and stating that he would not serve in Trump’s administration on the campaign trail. Kroenig was working on Senator Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) campaign at the time.
“We are all better off if he can get the best possible people around him and so I think me and many of my colleagues who opposed him in the past would be willing to go in and help with policy if we’re welcome,” Kroenig said.
Kroenig declined to comment on whether or not he has been offered a position within the Trump administration at this time.

Must we take credit for this? Does this homogenized, and most conservative administration become more temperate and nuanced with four more white men ?

Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority leadership expressed concerns this week that, despite facilitating over one million rides during the inauguration weekend, the financial costs of increasing services and extending hours negatively impacted the organization’s budget.
At a meeting with reporters Thursday, WMATA General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said the Metro staff is still calculating Metro’s total expenditure on additional services during Friday’s inauguration and Saturday’s Women’s March on Washington; however, he expects the costs of handling and assisting the record crowds from the march to exceed the revenue brought in from additional rides.
WMATA has increased its rail service hours three times during the past week since the inauguration, including Jan. 20 for President Donald Trump’s swearing-in, Jan. 21 for the Women’s March and Jan. 27 for the annual March for Life.
The rail system recorded 1,001,616 rides Jan. 21, the second-busiest day in Metro’s history. The system recorded 570,557 trips the day before.
Despite these numbers, officials are say they are concerned the rail system failed to profit due to the costs of payment for extra staff put in place to assist crowds.
D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), who is the chairman of the council’s Metro board, said at a board meeting Thursday that despite Metro’s efficient performance over the 48 hours, the agency is not receiving a reimbursement from the federal government for the additional services it provided.
“We had a million people riding the system. We probably spent more on operating the system than the additional revenue we took in. So, we lose money,” Evans said. “That’s something we just have to absorb.”
Evans said Metro’s performance during the time period improved the agency’s standing and credibility, a long-term benefit, especially as Congress begins work on a federal infrastructure package which may include further investments in WMATA.
However, Riders have praised Metro’s performance during the 48-hour period. Georgetown professor Marilyn McMorrow said in a Washington Post letter to the editor that though the system was full on Saturday, Metro employees were considerate and helpful.
“Metro did a splendid job with such packed cars and platforms. Metro officials were everywhere and so helpful,” McMorrow wrote. “I tried to thank every Metro official I saw. I know times have been bad. But Saturday, Metro did more than get ‘back to good.’ Saturday, I think, Metro was at its finest.”

The university has launched a new series of one-credit classes exclusively for seniors and recent alumni this spring in order to instill practical skills that can ease students’ transition into professional life after graduation.
The series, Bridge Courses, aims to allow students the opportunity to gain professional and personal skills, reflect on their university experiences and engage in discussions about how to lead a meaningful and fulfilling life.
The courses are part of the university’s Designing the Future(s) initiative. The initiative, launched in November 2013, engages the Georgetown community in exploring and experimenting with new methods to deliver higher education.
All Bridge courses are expected to include between 15 and 20 students in order to maintain a seminar and discussion-centered environment for students. Five one-credit classes are offered this spring.
Each class falls under one of two categories: “Personal and Professional Development,” which looks to prepare students for life after Georgetown, or “Revisiting the Core,” courses that revisit topics covered in earlier courses at Georgetown.
The courses will also be offered online to allow recently-graduated students to participate.
Senior Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs and School of Foreign Service professor Daniel Byman said the courses can offer more individualized benefits for students than traditional courses.
“So the hope is that they can apply it to new areas and can think about current issues that are of interest to them, so it can be more individualized in a way that they find helpful,” Byman said.
According to Byman, it is important to actively diversify traditional three-credit courses in order to offer students more learning opportunities.
“Learning doesn’t have to take place in a traditional, twice-a-week, 14 weeks-a-year three-credit class,” Byman said.
Byman is currently teaching a one-credit class in the School of Foreign Service on “Foreign Policy Under Trump,” which has four sections in order to accommodate all cohorts.
The lessons offered in his one-credit class would not be possible within a traditional three-credit structured class, according to Byman.
“Frankly, I don’t think it would be appropriate for a three-credit class, as you can guess, we don’t know enough about Trump’s foreign policy one way or another to do this,” Byman said. “For a one-credit class it’s perfectly reasonable to say we can learn a lot by trying to explore the different directions that Trump might go in because it enables us to try on different topics.”
The classes are not all taught by Georgetown professors. “Life Negotiations,” a class that falls under personal and professional development, will be taught by Andrew Caffey, an attorney at Caffey Law Firm. Caffey emphasized the significance of the practical nature of his course for graduating students.
“The role of my course, ‘Life Negotiations,’ is that it’s trying to be very practical. It’s a practical skillset that graduating seniors I hope, and am pretty confident, will be able to use for the rest of their lives,” Caffey said.
Associate Professor and Chair of the Theology department, Terrence Reynolds, is also teaching a Bridge course titled, “Freud and the Good Life Revisited.” The course is an interdisciplinary class that focuses on core life questions, according to Reynolds.
“It relies upon elements of psychology, sociology, philosophy, theology and history, with a strong ethical component as well,” Reynolds said. “It is designed for all students who wish to engage in a rich conversation about what, in their view, constitutes a good, fulfilled, human life. Freud’s pessimism about our prospects for happiness is largely a jumping-off point.”
Reynolds stated his aim for the course is for students to think about the purpose of their lives.
“My only goals for the course are that students grapple imaginatively and existentially with the authors we read and draw their own conclusions about the struggles and purposes of their lives,” Reynolds said.
Reynolds stressed the need for Bridge courses to complete students’ undergraduate experience.
“Some seniors might appreciate a one-credit opportunity to reconsider some materials they had encountered earlier in their academic careers at Georgetown,” Reynolds said. “Or that they wish they’d had the opportunity to explore.”
