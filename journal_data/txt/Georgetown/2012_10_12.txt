NATALIA ORTIZ FOR THE HOYACapital One CFO Gary Perlin (SFS ’72) attributed his career excellence to his experiential training in a speech cosponsored by The Lecture Fund held in Lohrfink Auditorium Tuesday.Gary Perlin (SFS ’72), chief financial officer of Capital One Bank, discussed the unpredictable trajectory of his career Tuesday evening in Lohrfink Auditorium.
Perlin’s speech was cosponsored by The Lecture Fund, the School of Foreign Service’s Karl F. Landegger Program in International Business Diplomacy, D.C.-based student investment fund Trebizond Investments and Zeeba Investment Group, a student-run markets fund started at Georgetown.
According to Perlin, his undergraduate years at Georgetown were very different from current students’ experiences: They were influenced by the riots that resulted from both the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the response to the Vietnam War.
“We started in the ’60s and finished in the ’70s. We saw the end of some things, we walked in on the middle of others and began some ourselves,” Perlin said, quoting the Class of 1973 yearbook. “Surely, we have lived in two different worlds. Perhaps all can say somewhat the same thing, but no class in recent memory has seen so deep-seated a metamorphosis.”
While at Georgetown, Perlin pursued a major in International Affairs but did not have a set career path.
“What I never would have imagined was that I would become the treasurer or the CFO of a major financial institution or two or three,” Perlin said. “In fact, I’m pretty sure I didn’t know what a CFO was.”
Perlin studied at the London School of Economics and Political Science and Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs before returning to D.C. to work as the chief financial officer of the World Bank. He focused on commodity production in Zambia, Botswana and Peru.
Perlin also served as treasurer of Fannie Mae, a government-sponsored initiative that serves the housing market, for 11 years.
Since 2003, Perlin has served as CFO of Capital One Bank, where he is responsible for accounting and reporting, financial planning, treasury and funding operations, corporate finance and investor relations.
He attributed his success as CFO to his unique perspective of business, which he attained by learning finance through experience instead of a formal financial education.
“I appreciated market forces and their imperfections, and I soon learned in the real world that the dynamics of markets are always idiosyncratic, which means they always need to be learned on the job, regardless of your academic background,” Perlin said.
Perlin encouraged students to seek out opportunities that may not seem apparent at first when establishing a career.
“I wish I could give you a magic formula for building the career you want or think you want, but I can’t,” Perlin said. “I never expected or trained for a career in finance, but careers are like that —  they’re serendipitous, and they only make sense in retrospect.”
The event included a question-and-answer session after Perlin’s talk, during which he encouraged students to consider the broad picture of finance, economics and the job market.
Andrew Nader (NHS ’16) said he was impressed by the speech.
“[Perlin] informed us through his own experiences that careers are unpredictable, but we must be creative and practice ingenuity in whatever work we find ourselves performing,” he said.

Georgetown University Chief of Police Jay Gruber met with fellow Washington, D.C., university public safety leaders to discuss solutions to campus crime at a conference at the Capital Hilton last Thursday and Friday.
The Clery Center for Security on Campus, a local nonprofit organization that seeks to decrease instances of rape on college campuses, held the two-day Proceeding in Partnership conference. Leaders from Howard University, Gallaudet University, Georgetown University and The George Washington University convened to discuss approaches for dealing with campus crime.
The conference featured a variety of seminars, including “Threat Assessment and Management: What Campus Leaders Need to Know” and “Stalking on Campus: Understanding Reporting and Investigative Opportunities.”
Gruber praised the Clery Center for its orchestration of the conference.
“The conference was an extremely important resource in emphasizing collaboration with the internal community and constituents at our university as well as to communicate with them on timely issues like alcohol or sexual violence that are taking place on campus,” he said.
Gruber also stressed the substantial role that the Clery Center, which has advocated for the public disclosure of campus crime records, has played in improving awareness about university crime.
“I think that because of the awareness and communication conferences like these have inspired, we see reasons for why crime trending has been slightly lower over the past three years,” Gruber said.
Nonetheless, Gruber stressed that police forces at urban universities like Georgetown face unique challenges in protecting community members.
“We face a tough struggle with off-campus surveillance,” he said. “We can’t protect students the same way once they get closer to M Street.”
Gruber added that the Department of Public Safety has instituted several preventative measures to reduce the risk of theft, including the creation of student focus groups to define best practices and a partnership with the bookstore to sell laptop cable locks.
“We can’t be everywhere, so we really rely on community and public support to ensure Georgetown remains the largely safe environment it currently is,” he said.

DAVID WANG FOR THE HOYAEight months since being sworn in, GUSA executives Clara Gustafson and Vail Kohnert-Yount have made strides toward their campaign goals.More than halfway through their term, Georgetown University Student Association President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vice-President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) have checked off a number of their platform priorities but still aim to improve campus sustainability and student life over the next several months.
Upon taking office in February, Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount, who comprise the first all-female GUSA executive, set goals to improve diversity, the judicial process for students, student involvement in campus initiatives, quality of student life and sustainability.
The beginning of their term was characterized by heated debates over the inclusion of an LGBTQ-friendly checkbox on freshman housing surveys. But Gustafson said that challenges to the original proposal ultimately resulted in a better solution: a non-discrimination statement that all students must sign as part of the housing process.
“We got a lot of feedback from students who said, ‘No,’ or, ‘You should do it a different way,’ so we reevaluated and came up with a more holistic approach to becoming a more welcoming campus for not only LGBTQ students but any minority,” Gustafson said.
More recently, the executive has also worked to address weaknesses in the university’s Code of Student Conduct.
The pair collaborated with the GUSA senate to hold a referendum on Sept. 28 urging Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson to change the code’s evidentiary standard from “more likely than not” to “clear and convincing.” The referendum saw a record turnout of 2,629 votes, with 96 percent in support of the change. However, the referendum did not carry the authority to alter the Code of Student Conduct, and Olson has yet to make a final decision.
This term has also been marked by an expanded role for GUSA in neighborhood relations. After a summer spent petitioning the university for greater student input in in town-gown discussions, Gustafson secured a spot on the Georgetown Community Partnership, a body composed of members of the university and multiple neighborhood groups that is designed to enforce the campus plan.
“I think it’s fair to say that based on what happened this summer [during the campus plan discussions], there were a lot of pressures to not include students in those discussions, so the fact that we are able to get administrators to get Clara and future GUSA presidents on that committee is a big win,” GUSA Chief of Staff Jake Sticka (COL ’13) said.
A Student Impact Committee composed of students, neighbors and administrators was also formed to supplement the community partnership. The committee will discuss issues including the expansion of food truck services, improvement of social life on campus and adjusting weekend GUTS bus schedules.
Student involvement in designing the New South Student Center also furthered the executive’s goal to increase the role students play in university initiatives.
“I think student involvement in the design of a building on campus has been unprecedented … partly because they donated money [through the student activities fee],” Gustafson said. “I think it sets a precedent for other buildings that we may not donate money … but that we have a stake in it.”
The executive has also made progress in its efforts to enhance students’ relationships with administrators. A new standing student committee composed of both undergraduate and graduate students will meet regularly with Provost Robert Groves to discuss ways to improve intellectual life on campus. Gustafson said the committee marks an important cornerstone for establishing direct communication between students and the administration
According to GUSA Senate Speaker Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), the current GUSA administration has sparked widespread engagement from the student body.
“I definitely detect a shift of GUSA’s role in moving toward the center of a lot of student advocacy issues, which is something a lot of students want to be part of and view as legitimate,” he said.
Despite these achievements, Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount still have unfulfilled initiatives.
The executive has expressed frustration over the university’s slow response to GUSA’s proposal to form an Office of Sustainability.
“At first we thought we were going to get a green light … and we kind of got a yellow light,” Kohnert-Yount said. “It might not happen during our administration, but some form of it might. … We will take steps in that direction.”
Gustafson attributed the university’s inaction to the shortage of data on sustainability at Georgetown.
“When we wanted [to create] an Office of Sustainability, that’s a very huge issue,” Gustafson said. “I think the university just doesn’t quite know where we stand [on] these things.”
Other unmet goals include the expansion of Grab ‘n’ Go options and improving facilities for artistic and athletic student groups.
For the remainder of their term, the pair said it will focus on improving on-campus life as it takes steps to implement recommendations from the Student Life Report, particularly the initiative to establish a universal system for students to book space. Kohnert-Yount looks forward to her remaining months in office with enthusiasm.
“We’re at a unique moment in Georgetown’s history where there’s a lot of momentum for important issues, and I’m really excited to be part of it,” she said.

The Licensing Oversight Committee unanimously recommended that the university terminate its contract with Adidas by Dec. 15 due to the company’s violation of Georgetown’s Code of Conduct for Licensees.
According to Scott Fleming, associate vice president for federal relations, the vote took place last Wednesday following months of deliberation. The committee made a formal recommendation to the Office of the President later that week.
Georgetown is a founding affiliate of the Worker Rights Consortium, which issued a report in January alleging that the sportswear company failed to pay $1.8 million in severance fees to employees after one of its manufacturing plants in Indonesia, PT Kizone, was shut down.
After the release of the report, LOC members sent a letter to Adidas and met with company representative Gregg Nebel in April.
According to LOC member Natalia Margolis (SFS ’13), Nebel said at the meeting that his company would not bend to pressure from outside groups.
“He made it clear that Adidas had no intention of paying the severance. He presented all the tools to support the workers by doing things like giving them food vouchers and helping with job placement, but he admitted that it wasn’t working,” she said. “To say, ‘We’re not going to pay you the money you’re owed, and we’re going to pay you in these food vouchers or other alternatives,’ is against the law.”
Students at Cornell University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, have also expressed concern about their schools’ contracts with Adidas and Cornell terminated its contract with Adidas on Sept. 13, according to an article published in Cornell’s in-house weekly newspaper, Cornell Chronicle, on Sept. 17.
The LOC was unable to meet to make a decision until last Wednesday because of scheduling conflicts among its members, which include students, staff and faculty.
Fleming indicated that some members felt the relatively small size of the university’s contract with Adidas would render the termination irrelevant, but he also said that the size of the contract was not a major stumbling block in passing the recommendation.
Margolis said that money should not be a factor in the decision.
“While it might not make a huge impact financially for Adidas, I think the fact that Georgetown is making the stance that we care might make an impact for other universities,” Margolis said. “It makes a huge moral statement.”
An online petition created by the Georgetown Solidarity Committee through change.org, which called for the university to sever its contract with Adidas, played a role in the decision. According to GSC member Julia Hubbell (COL ’15), the petition garnered 172 signatures between its launch on Sept. 18 and its submission to the LOC last week.
“Certainly, the petition was a factor in the LOC’s discussions,” Fleming wrote in an email. “The committee considered a variety of comments and perspectives throughout the time that the matter was before the committee since last academic year.”
Though University President John J. DeGioia will have the final say in cutting ties with Adidas, Hubbell said that she expects the committee’s actions to weigh heavily on his decision.
“It is just an advisory body, but the LOC recommendations are taken very seriously,” she said. “Up until Dec. 15 we are going to continue talking to admins from the student perspective and make sure the action is completed.”
Fleming also expressed confidence that the university will follow through on the LOC’s suggestion.
“The disposition of our recommendation rests with the university administration, and I can tell you that it is actively under consideration,” he wrote. “I would expect a decision in the not-too-distant future.”

The Catholic Association of Students for Equality, a nationwide organization founded by Georgetown students with the mission of promoting acceptance of all sexual orientations on Catholic college campuses, was launched Thursday.
CASE members announced the formation of their group in an open letter Thursday.
“We were … raised with Catholic values. We were taught to believe in family, love and commitment. To work to ensure respect, inclusion and human dignity,” the letter read. “Therefore, it is only natural that as we grew into adults we would apply these values to how we viewed our LGBTQ identities. … We have an experience, a viewpoint given to us by our creator as LGBTQ Catholics, which needs to be shared.”
Founder Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) said that CASE has three main goals: to create a network for pride groups on Catholic campuses, reach out to Catholic schools that do not have recognized pride groups and raise awareness of pride groups’ roles on Catholic campuses.
“Being at the intersection of LGBTQ and Catholic values is a precarious place to be and difficult to navigate,” Lloyd said.
Lloyd developed the idea for CASE over the summer when he realized that he could not find LGBTQ voices in Catholic discourse on a national level.
“As a student, I know that at Georgetown we have a strong LGBTQ voice,” he said. “I thought, ‘How do I get all the other Catholic campuses to share their stories with the nation?’”
He began the project by emailing pride organizations at other Catholic and Jesuit colleges and universities and received an enthusiastic response.
CASE co-founder and The Hoya staff writer Esteban Garcia (SFS ’15) attended the National Jesuit Student Leadership Conference at College of the Holy Cross during the summer to work with other Jesuit student leaders during the founding process. He gauged student and institution interest, ultimately forming a partnership with seven of the CASE member schools.
“From the beginning, we wanted to give gay Catholic students a voice,” García said. “It was to let the Catholic Church that we are here, and we are queer. We do exist, we are on these campuses. We are Catholic, and we support equality for all Americans.”
Current members of CASE include pride groups at Santa Clara University, DePaul University, Loyola University Maryland, Loyola Marymount University, Fordham University, Boston College and the College of the Holy Cross, according to Lloyd.
Over the next semester, Lloyd hopes to expand CASE’s membership to more regions of the country and begin networking between member schools.
According to Lloyd, CASE members are not all Catholic.
“By raising awareness, we want to fight the idea that recognizing groups on a Catholic campus is in conflict with Catholic values,” he said. “The argument just isn’t true. Not only are they not incompatible, but for LGBTQ people [at a Catholic school], it is important to be in line with Catholic values.”
CASE is entirely student run and has no affiliation with Georgetown’s LGBTQ Center. However, GU Pride will contribute resources to assist smaller, non-recognized pride organizations at other schools.
“I am a lesbian and Catholic, and this is near and dear to my heart,” GU Pride President Meghan Ferguson (COL ’15) said. “I really like the idea of connecting student groups across the country. Sometimes it can feel isolating, like you’re the only one. This will get a dialogue going across campuses that don’t have the resources, and we can see how we can support them.”

EUGENE ANG/THE HOYAThe Supreme Court scrutinized the University of Texas at Austin’s admissions policy when it heard oral arguments Wednesday.Affirmative action admission policies came under fire as the Supreme Court of the United States heard oral arguments in the case of Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin Wednesday.
The case originated in 2009 when Abigail Fisher, a white applicant, was denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin. Fisher sued the school on the basis that its affirmative action policy violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The United States District Court upheld the University of Texas’ right to include affirmative action as part of its admissions process in a 2009 decision, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s ruling in 2011.
However, the university’s policy, which allows it to consider race as one of several factors in the admissions process, faced scrutiny from several Supreme Court justices Wednesday.
According to The Washington Post, many of the justices questioned where the university draws the line in seeking a “critical mass” of racial minorities.
“You won’t tell me what the critical mass is,” Chief Justice John Roberts said to University of Texas lawyer Gregory Garre. “How am I supposed to do the job that our precedents say I should do?”
Along with seven other Catholic universities, Georgetown filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Aug. 10 in support of the University of Texas and its race-conscious admissions process.
“[The universities] believe that race-blind admissions practices frustrate or impede the achievement of a diverse student body,” the brief reads. “Considering an applicant’s race or ethnicity as a factor — but not a defining one — in a holistic review of a student … [allows universities] to more fully realize their missions of recognizing the dignity and uniqueness of each person during the admissions process.”
Nonetheless, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said that Georgetown’s approach to affirmative action actually involves targeting students from low-income backgrounds rather than particular racial backgrounds.
“Philosophically, we support affirmative action, because in a holistic admissions process like ours, many disparate factors about every candidate affect how we review them,” he said. “That said, in practice we think of affirmative action as giving attention to first-generation and low-income students, many of whom come from underrepresented minority groups. So, to some extent we have redefined how we think of affirmative action.”
Reactions from the Georgetown student body about the university’s open support for affirmative action admissions policies were mixed.
Celia Sawyerr (SFS ’16), a black student originally from Sierra Leone, said that the policy can be problematic regardless of a student’s race.
“I hate that people assume that the only reason I’m here is because I’m black,” Sawyerr said. “And I do think that there’s a certain element in the entire thing that may be very unfair towards majority groups like whites and Asians.”
However, some students, like Dayana Morales (SFS ’16), think that affirmative action policies should be expanded.
“I would like to see universities take gender and not just race more strongly into account when evaluating individuals for admission,” she said. “Affirmative action as now practiced is a good start, a step in the right direction, but in my opinion, it doesn’t go far enough.”

Georgetown University Medical Center’s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center opened its new Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities Research in Southeast D.C. with a ribbon-cutting ceremony Thursday.
D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Councilmember David Catania and Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia attended the ceremony, among other university and district health officials.
Located at 1000 New Jersey Ave. SE, the new office will be led by cancer epidemiologist Lucile Adams-Campbell and will focus on reducing cancer-related and other health disparities among the underserved and ethnic minority populations in the city.
She defined health disparity as any inequality in treatment or services resulting from race, gender, physical or mental disabilities, occupation, age or education.
“Our focus is on addressing healthy lifestyles to prevent and control cancer,” Adams-Campbell said. “We know we have high sedentary populations, which results in high obesity. We’re focusing on nutrition and diet. If we can just improve the lifestyles of the community we serve, we can make a difference.”
Louis Weiner, director of the Lombardi Center, emphasized the importance of having a research center in an underserved area of the District.
“The District of Columbia has one of the highest cancer mortality rates in the nation, and racial and ethnic disparities in the cancer burden are pronounced, particularly among African-Americans,” Weiner said. “With this wonderful new office, we can more effectively partner in cancer prevention efforts within the community and engage underserved populations and identify and remove barriers to care.”
Gray also pointed out the systemic inequities in health care availability within the different parts of the city.
“We had, at last count, somewhere near 750 primary care physicians in the District of Columbia,” Gray said. “But when you go east of the [Anacostia River] in Wards 7 and 8, where 140,000 people live, there are something like 35 or 40 primary care physicians who actually practice. It’s a dramatic illustration of the additional investments that we need to make.”
The new research office is part of GUMC’s effort to resolve healthcare inequities in the community. Its research undertakings are funded in part by a $6.1 million grant from the National Institutes of Health.
DeGioia lauded the center as an extension of Georgetown’s partnership with the District of Columbia.
“This office adds a new dimension to the range of partnerships, services and collaborations between our university and our city, ensuring that the science that is pursued by Georgetown researchers and faculty is accessible across our city,” he said.

After a U.S. District Judge Mary Collyer ruled that anti-jihad advertisements be immediately installed in D.C. Metro stations last Friday, Georgetown students have launched a protest against the decision.
The anti-Muslim ads, which read, “In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad,” were paid for by the American Freedom Defense Initiative.
The Associated Press quoted David Yerushalmi, a lawyer representing the AFDI, Oct. 5. “The result is absolutely correct,” Yerushalmi said. “There simply was no way under the First Amendment jurisprudence that we have today that this ad should not have gone up when contracted.”
A petition against the ads created by Nabeel Zewail (SFS ’15) and Saaliha Khan (COL ’13) has garnered 1,618 signatures since it was first circulated Oct. 1.
“The United States was founded on the principle of tolerance and respect for all faith traditions; therefore, it is important that the D.C. Metro takes a strong stand,” the petition reads. “[The students of Georgetown University] feel that these ads have no place in the subway system of our nation’s capital.”
The D.C. Subway Commission temporarily postponed the installment of the ads last week in light of the violence incited by the release of “Innocence of Muslims,” a 14-minute video posted on YouTube Sept. 12 that insulted the Prophet Muhammad.
In response, the AFDI sued the D.C. transit system. The case went to the D.C. District Court, where a judge ruled that the postponement violated the AFDI’s right to free speech. Since then, the advertisements have been posted in four Metro stations, where they will hang for one month.
Zewail said he will continue to work against the installation of the ads despite the court’s ruling.
“Obviously, we are disappointed with the outcome of the case and wished the D.C. Metro would not post these hateful ads, but we are currently planning a response,” Zewail said. “We are focused on two goals: one, to continue to work to try to get the signs down and two, to counter their message of hate with a positive one about Islam and Muslims.”
Zewail and Khan have tabled in Red Square, advertised on Facebook and solicited the help of the Interfaith Council and the Muslim Students Association to promote their cause.
“I think, as a Catholic and person of faith, it’s important for us to stand up to this no matter what community is scapegoated,” Jordan Denari (SFS ’13), co-president of the Interfaith Council and practicing Catholic, said. “What we are realizing is that it is really our responsibility to step up and address this.”

The McDonough School of Business received the 2012 Brillante Award for Educational Excellence from the National Society of Hispanic MBAs at a fundraising gala in Orlando, Fla. last Friday.
NSHMBA grants five Brillante awards every year to recognize corporate, educational, membership and volunteer excellence and has honored big name companies such as Sara Lee, State Farm and American Express in the past, according to the official organization website.
This year, other recipients included IBM, Su Casa Hispanic Center, an organization in Cincinnati, Ohio, that provides aid to immigrants, Cosette Gutierrez, a community relations employee at Target and former Chairman of the NSHMBA Board of Directors and Julio Rocha, founder of Rocha Financial Group, LLC.
“Winning a national award like Brillante showcases how Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business continues to be at the forefront of business education,” Elaine Romanelli, senior associate dean for MBA programs, said. “We are honored to be among this year’s award recipients.”
The university’s application for the award was submitted by alum Mary Jean Duran (MBA ‘91), an active member of NSHMBA.
To be considered for the award, candidate schools must advocate for diverse communities and students, promote representation through a diversity initiative, prepare minority students for future careers and engage in collaborative partnerships that foster recruitment, retention, development and graduation of minority students, according to an MSB press release from Oct. 1.
“Serious and sustained discourse among people of different cultures promotes a deeper understanding of international business,” Romanelli said. “I am proud that our program was recognized for its achievements in the area of diversity.”

Last week, six students graduated from Georgetown’s first-ever online-only offering, a master’s nursing program that lets participants take classes through video chats and submit assignments over the Internet without ever leaving their clinical posts.
But the nursing program — which has grown to an enrollment of over 600 since it was launched in March 2011 — is only the first in a series of efforts to integrate technology into the Georgetown education.
Building off the success of this early foray into online learning, Provost Robert Groves recently announced an initiative to bring a new wave of technological innovation to the rest of campus.
According to an Oct. 5 email Groves wrote to the campus community, the university’s Georgetown Technology-Enhanced Learning initiative will aim to expand Georgetown’s online presence and the use of technology in on-campus programs.
Included in the email was a Sept. 19 document titled “Technology-Enhanced Learning: Determining the Georgetown Way,” which lays out the principles that will guide the expansion.
The document cites as one of the university’s main goals the optimization of the use of digital resources and other technology-assisted learning strategies so that faculty members can better help and interact with students. It also highlights the potential for online technology to provide real-time feedback to professors about what course material students find particularly difficult.
According to Groves, this initiative could eventually lead to the redesign of large introductory courses, increased emphasis on student research and more online course offerings. In these early stages, however, administrators are seeking feedback from students and faculty before moving forward.
“This initiative will have several phases, but this first phase is seeking input on whether we’re headed in the right direction for evaluating and implementing new uses of learning technology,” Groves wrote in an Oct. 10 blog post.
Seeking to foster communication between administrators and the rest of the Georgetown community, Groves plans to create what he calls the Working Group on Technology-Enhanced Learning, a forum for students and faculty to share ideas and provide feedback.
“The students and faculty are the heart of the university. They are the font of innovation. The role of a provost is to provide the environment for both of them to thrive. Successful university initiatives depend on the creativity of students and faculty,” Groves said.
Though Groves was enthusiastic about the increased role of technology in on-campus programs, the university currently has no plans to expand its online-only courses.
In this regard, the university lags behind many of its peer institutions, who have more readily incorporated technology into their educational model. Brown, Columbia and Stanford, for example, are among a growing number of universities that now offer online courses through Coursera, a startup online education company. According to a Sept. 19 article in The New York Times, online course offerings have become such a sign of prestige that some university presidents feel their reputation will be damaged if they do not offer these programs.
According to Georgetown College Dean Chester Gillis, university administrators are responding to the growing trend with caution.
“We’re not opposed to it. We’re not afraid of it. But if we are going to embrace it, we want to make sure that we are going to do it appropriately and carefully,” he said.
Groves added that any addition of technology to university curricula will be implemented in a manner that is mindful of Georgetown’s approach to education.
“The Georgetown way on this score will be to evaluate when online experiences assist the learning and when they don’t,” he said. “We want to preserve what is special at Georgetown but make it even better.”

In response to student comments on the university-wide forum IdeaScale, the administration is in the process of assessing Blackboard’s usefulness and discussing how to improve the online resource.
According to Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis, the university considered updating the site even before a suggestion was posted on IdeaScale last month. The post has received 106 votes since it was first published Sept. 16.
“We know that this has been an area that students are passionate about,” Davis wrote in an email.
Davis added that University Information Services spoke with students at the beginning of the year and was aware of their concerns.
“Blackboard has been discussed in many of our meetings with students on campus, from GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) to the Tombs’ ‘Meet the CIO’ session in the spring,” she wrote.
UIS created the survey, which opened Oct. 2 and will close on Oct. 11, to allow students to rate their Blackboard experiences.
According to Davis, over 650 students have taken the survey, and the university has contacted Blackboard to begin brainstorming how to improve the resource.
“My deputy and I recently spent the afternoon meeting with Blackboard executives to discuss our current use of the product and how we can better partner to address GU issues or concerns,” she wrote.
Most of students’ complaints have regarded Blackboard’s navigability.
“I think the interface is too confusing, too complicated, [and] it’s just not user-friendly,” Swedian Lie (COL ’13) said. “To get anywhere, you need to go through a lot of pages first.”
Davis said she checks the IdeaScale website weekly and receives notifications when someone posts an idea in the technology section. So far, posts from the site have inspired projects ranging from improving campus WiFi and cell phone reception to adding information to the university’s mobile app.
According to Davis, her goal for Blackboard is to create a student-friendly tool.
“Ultimately, we want to provide a product that students love to use,” she wrote.

COURTESY OF YOU-ME PARKAshwini Tambe spoke at the Women’s and Gender Studies 25th Anniversary celebration.The Women’s and Gender Studies Program, which celebrated its 25th anniversary last Saturday, is looking to expand its size and scope in the coming years.
The celebration included a reception and a panel, titled “Building Feminist Futures,” which featured six of the field’s most prominent scholars from multiple academic institutions.
“It was an incredibly exciting occasion for feminists to meet, challenge and celebrate each other,” WGST Program Director You-Me Park said.
The panel and round-table discussions aimed to provoke discussions about feminist thought and movements over the past 20 years, according to Park. It also provided an opportunity for participants to reflect on the role of WGST in promoting feminism on campus.
Monica Vizconde (COL ’14), an event coordinator who changed her major to women’s and gender studies after taking an introductory course in the subject, emphasized the unique perspective the program offers.
“WGST allows you to see the world through a different lens,” Visconde said. “Rather than just looking at political courses of action, we explore deeper issues.”
WGST was born out of the Women’s Studies Program, which first began offering a minor in the fall of 1992. Since then, the program’s name changed to Women’s and Gender Studies, and it is now one of the largest interdisciplinary, cross-cultural programs at Georgetown.
WGST currently offers a major and minor to students in the College, while students in the School of Foreign Service can earn a WGST certificate.
Approximately 500 students participate in the program’s courses and roughly 20 to 30 students with either a major or minor in women’s and gender studies every year, according to Park.
Park said that the majority of WGST students are female, and WGST is still a program, not a department. Because of this, WGST receives less university funding than other majors, which limits the scale of events it can organize and the quality of its courses and faculty.
“This program gives me a home, and it saddens me that the program itself does not have a stable one. The fact that professors in the program do not qualify for tenure scares me. We have already lost great professors because of this,” Bonnibel Rosario (COL ’15) wrote in an email. “When I come back to Georgetown as an alumna in three years, I want to see the professors who guided me guiding other students and see Georgetown as a place that embraces their mentorship.”
Madeline Wiseman (COL ’13), who also helped coordinate the event, added that growth and greater awareness about the program are crucial.
“When I say I am a WGST major, I usually get looks of confusion — even contempt,” she said. “But if people took a look at the importance of the issues we study in the context of their own lives, they might not dismiss it so quickly.”
The photo captioned “Women’s and Gender Studies director You-Me Park spoke at the program’s 25th anniversary event,” was incorrectly labeled.  The speaker portrayed is Ashwini Tambe. A correction was made at 4:16 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 14.

Administrators, Jesuits and Vatican II staff discussed the historic council that transformed the Catholic Church at a conference titled “Vatican II After Fifty Years: Dialogue and Catholic Identity” in Gaston Hall Thursday evening.
After University President John J. DeGioia welcomed the audience, keynote lecturer Fr. John O’Malley, S.J., spoke about the integral role that dialogue played in the Second Vatican Council According to O’Malley, conversation and inquiry have not always been a part of traditional Catholicism.
“‘Blessed are the poor in spirit,’ no discussion. ‘Love thy neighbor,’ no discussion. ‘Repent,’ no discussion,” he said.
O’Malley admitted that priests contribute to this paradigm.
“After homilies, do you think I smile at the congregation and ask, ‘Do you think I’m on the right track?’” he said.
For O’Malley, the 20th-century concepts of multiculturalism and religious pluralism opened the door for communication during Vatican II.
In the wake of the horrors of the Holocaust, the Catholic Church reflected on the importance of both tolerance and inter-religious discourse.
“The Church was ready, [and] the dialogue needed a voice,” O’Malley said.
Thomas Stransky, a Paulist priest who was one of Vatican II’s original staff members, brought an insider perspective to the event. In his lecture, Stranksy highlighted the uncertainty and disorder that took place during the council.
“It was an unpredictable journey with an unknown outcome,” he said.
Stransky noted the wide range of issues that the council dealt with, such as celibacy and Judaism.
In spite of its religious nature, however, the council was not immune to events going on in the secular world.
“Vatican II was not free from political influence or pressure,” he said.
Like O’Malley, Stransky zeroed in on the Church’s transition from monologue to dialogue. He said the council’s participants were looking for a new language that was affirmative instead of accusatory.
Students and audience members responded positively to the conference lectures.
“O’Malley gave an excellent vision of the council and of dialogue, and it’s something we live out in the university community,” Chris Duffner (COL ’13) said.

Students discussed Georgetown’s history of on-campus student activism and a 2005 hunger strike that protested worker conditions at the university at an event in Intercultural Center Wednesday night.
The event, which followed a showing of the documentary “Living Wage 101,” was co-sponsored by Movimiento Estudiantil Chican@ de Aztlan de Georgetown — a student organization that examines Latin culture, community and politics — and the Georgetown Solidarity Committee.
The documentary chronicled a three-year campaign at Georgetown that aimed to raise workers’ wages from $6.60 to $14.08 an hour and provide fair working conditions to university employees.
To achieve these goals, students participated in a 10-day hunger strike. The drastic measures resulted in raising workers’ wages and gaining the right to organize.
While the film told the story of the hunger strike, it focused on the importance of justice and emphasized that the campaign’s success depended on the partnership between the employees and students.
Tarshea Smith, a cashier in Leo J. O’Donovan Hall spoke about her experience during the unionization process last year. Workers employed by Aramark Higher Education joined a local chapter of UNITE HERE, a national labor union that encompasses the hotel, airport, food service, laundry and gaming industries.
“The students organized the workers and the workers became worker organizers, so that was when I started organizing my co-workers,” Smith said.
Students and workers also approached the faculty for support during the process, which concluded in February when the contract was signed.
“Some of the professors didn’t know. Some of the professors thought [the university] was because so many of the other departments are unionized,” Smith said. ”The cafeteria was the last place.”

Georgetown honored 15 recently tenured or promoted faculty members at the Fall Faculty Con-vocation ceremony Wednesday afternoon in Gaston Hall.
The faculty members are from multiple schools and departments within the university.
“Through your work, your scholarship and your teaching, you have helped to enrich our tradition and deepen our commitment to the highest levels of academic excellence,” University President John J. DeGioia said in his address to the faculty.
Guest speaker Ann M. Pendleton-Jullian, a professor of architecture at The Ohio State University and a visiting professor at Georgetown, spoke about the importance of incorporating research into university curricula.
“A traditional university is set up with the notion that you have the disciplines at the center — it’s called core curriculum for a reason — and then you have research as an edge condition,” she said. “If we’re going to turn the university inside out, we put those enduring questions in the middle … not as big things, but as little pieces we all work on, and then the disciplines move to the outside.”
