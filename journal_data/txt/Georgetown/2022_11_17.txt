For the first time in over 20 years, two students from Georgetown have been selected for the internationally renowned Rhodes Scholarship.
Atharv Gupta (SFS ’23) and Isabella Turilli (SFS ’22) are joining this year’s cohort of 32 U.S. Rhodes Scholars for their accomplishments transforming emerging markets and global health diplomacy, respectively. The Rhodes Scholarship is the world’s oldest and one of the most selective international scholarship programs that honors students for their outstanding scholarly achievements, character, potential for leadership in their prospective fields and commitment to others and to the common good.
Each year, thousands of prospective Rhodes Scholars submit applications to win two years of postgraduate study at Oxford University in any subject of their choosing. Gupta, a Science, Technology and International Affairs (STIA) major in the School of Foreign Service (SFS), plans to pursue a masters in Social Science of the Internet at Oxford. Turilli graduated with her degree in STIA in May 2022 and will pursue a masters in public policy and public policy research at Oxford. 
Gupta said he celebrated with those who helped make the accomplishment possible after receiving the news.
“Saturday night, I got to tell all my friends and we celebrated, but the next day was when news spread really quick. I honestly think it still hasn’t sunk in fully, it’s still only been a few days and my day-to-day life is still the same,” Gupta told The Hoya. “Today I still had to submit — and start — a paper due at midnight; life goes on. Above all though, it’s just surreal.”
Turilli said she looks forward to working collaboratively with her fellow Rhodes scholars.
“Being part of the Rhodes community is a totally unexpected honor. I truly feel as though I am standing on the shoulders of giants, and I cannot wait to learn with and from such a distinguished and accomplished group of scholars, activists and officials,” Turilli said.
The application process started during the Spring 2022 semester, when the applicants had to apply for internal nomination from Georgetown. After receiving their nominations in June, Gupta and Turilli had to secure several letters of recommendation, official transcripts, resumes and essays, on top of preparing for interviews. 
Gupta said the application cycle was the most intensive writing and reflection process he has ever experienced.
“I learned so much during this period about how to clearly articulate my beliefs while also telling a story, presenting my personal narrative in a way that interviewers can buy into,” Gupta told The Hoya. “It was transformative, to the point where interview prep even showed up in my dreams.”
Professor Emily Mendenhall, who served as Turilli’s thesis advisor, said Turilli was dedicated to her passions both in and outside the classroom.
“Isabella is both deeply intellectual and scrappy. She is constantly multi-tasking through her scholarship and practical work,” Mendenhall told The Hoya. “For her thesis, Isabella read voraciously and interviewed more than 20 leaders in global health policy, from scholars to practitioners and policymakers, interweaving her reading with the interviews,” Mendenhall said.
Turilli served as a crew chief for Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service (GERMS) and researched pandemic preparedness at Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security as an undergraduate. She currently works as a research associate at the Council on Foreign Relations, a top international relations think tank. 
With the Rhodes Scholarship, Turilli said she hopes to improve transparency around healthcare policy so the general public can participate in future decision making.
Gupta said his classmates at Georgetown have reinforced his dedication to improving international aid and that he is looking forward to learning more from his peers at Oxford.
“I’m an optimist at heart and a lot of that comes from the excitement and hope of students around me,” Gupta said. “I think it’s easy, especially when studying subjects like international development and relations, to subscribe to a darker view of the future. But my peers have shaped this part of me a lot and I continue to get energy from them even when things seem bleak.”

D.C. Council unanimously passed a bill requiring all Washington, D.C. government-owned buildings to provide access to free period products.
The “Period Act,” introduced by Ward 2 Councilmember Brooke Pinto (LAW ’17) in March 2021, seeks to expand access to free period products for all District residents in public buildings such as libraries, recreation centers, shelters and congregate care facilities. The bill, officially titled the Period Equity Righting an Injustice of District Residents Act of 2022, follows another unanimously-passed bill introduced by Pinto in January that requires schools in the District to provide free period products to students. The Council held a public hearing on the bill Oct. 11 ahead of its ultimate passage Nov. 15.
With the passage of the bill, government-operated and government-owned buildings leased by private entities must provide free period products in all women’s and gender-neutral bathrooms, as well as in at least one men’s bathroom in buildings where no gender-neutral bathrooms are available. These products include both tampons and pads to ensure the needs of menstruating individuals are met.
Lauryn Ping (COL ’23), vice president of pro-abortion rights student group H*yas for Choice, said this bill further reinforces the importance of period products as a part of personal health.
“When we think of public bathrooms, we know they provide things to wash your hands like soap and paper towels, they provide toilet paper,” Ping said in an interview with The Hoya. “These things are seen as crucial to like the health and well-being of people, but for some reason, period products are oftentimes not lumped into that category of essential things for health, even though people with uteruses get periods.”
According to Pinto, the bill seeks to ensure the health and dignity of D.C. residents and ensure access to period products without worrying about costs or where to find them. 
“Women, transgender men and nonbinary people who menstruate need access to free menstrual products – a health necessity each month,” Pinto said in a press release. “We have seen the associated costs and burdens of accessing these products fall disproportionately on people of color and lower income families.” 
While a lack of specific research exists on how many D.C. residents are affected by an inability to access period products, experts have found that a lack of access to period products is correlated with food insecurity, suggesting that roughly 10.6% of District residents experience difficulty accessing period products.
The bill will help improve the health and well-being of low-income menstruating individuals, according to Ping.
“Period poverty focuses a lot on the economic barriers that prevent people from accessing period products,” Ping said. “The fact that these products are being made available in public restrooms will allow people who are houseless or people who can’t afford to get to these products to not have to decide between period products and food on their table to support their family.”
According to research conducted by the D.C. Council Office of Racial Equity (CORE), a lack of access to free period products can affect the mental and physical health, as well as the social and economic well-being, of menstruating people. This lack of access has a disproportionate effect on women of color and women of color with low incomes.
Ping said it is essential that the bill focused on how access to period products impacts underserved communities throughout D.C.
“It’s really important, not just for period poverty but for every single bill, to really examine how this bill impacts marginalized communities and keep working to ensure that we’re improving our laws and policies to better encapsulate the needs of all people.” Ping said.
The bill will cost $2.3 million to implement for the 2023 fiscal year and a total of $7.1 million over a four-year span. The Department of General Services estimates the District will need to install and keep about 1,327 dispensers in government-owned buildings, excluding schools, which were covered by Pinto’s previous bill. 
Pinto said the passage of the bill will seek to improve the lives of menstruating individuals in the District and reinforce the idea that period product access is a necessary and fundamental human right. 
“This bill is another step towards overcoming the stigma surrounding menstruation and treating access to period products similarly to toilet paper – a product everyone agrees is a basic necessity and can be readily found in public buildings and places,” Pinto said.

More than 280 students have signed a Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) petition urging the university to remove the large white tents on campus by the end of the Fall 2022 semester.
The tents — which currently stand in Red Square, the Southwest Quadrangle, Dahlgren Quadrangle and the Leavey Esplanade as well as outside White-Gravenor Hall and the Rafik B. Hariri Building — were originally installed to create more outdoor meeting spaces on campus during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Camber Vincent (SFS ’24), the speaker of the GUSA Senate. Vincent said GUSA hopes to use the petition released Oct. 27 to show student support for removing the tents to allow for more versatile use of outdoor campus spaces.
The petition calls for the university to share a detailed timeline for the removal of the tents and asks Georgetown to explore creating permanent, sustainable outdoor gathering spaces on campus in place of the tents. 
Jordan Van Slingerland (SFS ’26), who signed the petition, said the tents interfere with Georgetown’s already limited green space. 
“I think first and foremost, we’re a relatively compact campus. I don’t think Georgetown students realize it as much, but especially when you compare us with other universities, we’re a very, very compact campus. We don’t have as much green space as I think a lot of students would like, and we don’t have enough space for activities,” Van Slingerland told The Hoya.
Vincent said GUSA is advocating for the tents to be removed as soon as possible in part because of the environmental impact of winterizing them during colder months.
“They shouldn’t be winterized because winterizing them costs a ton of money and additionally uses propane heaters, which is really bad for the environment, both locally and in general,” Vincent said. 
John DiPierri (SFS ’25), GUSA’s financial appropriations chair, said a record number of students signed the petition. 
“All four grades are represented, all five undergraduate schools, people from all backgrounds, all ideologies, all experiences,” DiPierri told The Hoya. “It’s a very noncontroversial issue.”
GUSA circulated the petition on Georgetown GroupMe chats, Instagram and Flok, a social media platform that students can use to write anonymous posts. 
Nate Schindler (MSB ’26) signed the petition and said he was interested to see how students’ voices impact the university’s decision-making. 
“I think that’s what’s going to be interesting to see for my first look as a freshman, what the student body can actually achieve at this school and what our voices and how our voices can impact university decisions,” Schindler told The Hoya. “So having known about the stigmas about GUSA and whether or not it can be efficient, it’s going to be interesting to see for me if this gets passed.”
According to DiPierri, GUSA aims to include a student representative in all future discussions regarding the tents. 
“One of the goals we’ve had over the past couple of months has been to kind of put student voice into the decisions around the tents,” DiPierri said. “Lots of students dislike where they’re located and what they represent, as obstructions in their day-to-day lives.”
A university spokesperson said that while the tents remain an important part of the university’s public health strategy, it is taking into account the tent petition as it makes a decision on the tent contracts.
“The use of tented spaces on the Main Campus and Medical Center has been an important part of our layered public health approach. The university continuously reviews the various public health, academic and space considerations related to tent use,” the spokesperson wrote. The University has received a student petition from GUSA and student signatories, and is reviewing the feedback as part of the ongoing tent-use consideration.”
DiPierri said the tents take up valuable space that can be used for better purposes. 
“I remember the first week I moved in, when I was a freshman last year, they put the tent up for the beach volleyball court,” DiPierri said. “We were really disheartened that we couldn’t play volleyball on Southwest Quad. That space is so beautiful, and there’s very little green space on campus, and that tent really ruined it.”
Van Slingerland said removing the tents would allow students to make better use of Georgetown’s campus. 
“We’re coming out of a very tough period in our lives right now, and we want to make the best of our four years in college,” Van Slingerland said. “So whether that be by having that beach volleyball court there in the Southwest Quad, whether that be by having more space for tabling in Red Square or just not having that visual obstruction there or being able to better utilize a space like the Harbin patio. The tents definitely hinder students’ ability to make the best of this campus.”

The Capital Pride Alliance (CPA) of Washington, D.C. announced the District will host WorldPride, one of the largest LGBTQ+ celebrations in the world, in 2025. 
InterPride, a worldwide pride alliance consisting of more than 400 pride alliances, announced D.C. as the host city for the 2025 festivities on Nov. 4. The initial 2021 hosting bid from Capital Pride Alliance, a nonprofit organization that organizes Pride events throughout the District, was rejected when Taiwan was initially selected to host the 2025 event. A disagreement between Taiwan and InterPride regarding the name of the event led to the WorldPride 2025 Taiwan Preparation Committee withdrawing from hosting duties. The CPA ultimately sent in a successful bid to host WorldPride 2025.
Members of CPA dedicated their time to promoting their bid and speaking on behalf of D.C. at InterPride’s Annual General Meeting and World Conference in Guadalajara, Mexico. Members at the conference debated where WorldPride 2025 would be hosted after plans with Taiwan fell through. The majority of members voted that D.C. would serve as the host, according to Ryan Bos, the executive director of CPA.
CPA is currently planning for WorldPride events to take place between May 22, 2025, and June 8, 2025. A variety of cultural programs in collaboration with other local LGBTQ+ organizations will be featured at WorldPride, including Trans Pride, Latinx Pride, AAPI Pride, Silver Pride and Youth Pride. CPA will also hold a Human Rights Conference in conjunction with DC Black Pride, specialized Pride events that focus on celebrating the intersectionality of queerness and other identities. 
“CPA is thrilled and honored to have been awarded the privilege of hosting WorldPride 2025,” Bos said in a press release. “WorldPride provides an expansive platform to further the fight for civil and human rights by inspiring changemakers, while collectively celebrating our achievements, diversity and resilience as a local, national and global community.” 
April Sizemore-Barber, associate professor in the women’s and gender studies program at Georgetown University, said she believes the District being chosen as the host for WorldPride 2025 represents an important opportunity for the United States to reject rising anti-LGTBQ+ ideologies.
“At a time when US politicians feel increasingly empowered to run on anti-LGBT — and particularly anti-trans — platforms, an event like WP brings the masses of queer people to the seat of government, showing in sheer numbers the many who will be impacted by homophobic policies,” Sizemore-Barber wrote to The Hoya. 
Sizemore-Barber emphasized the need for protest and resistance among LGBTQ+ communities in the face of hostility to the right to privacy and concerns regarding future Supreme Court rulings on LGBTQ+ rights. 
“As we’ve learned from the Supreme Court’s recent ruling on Dobbs, those rights to privacy and bodily autonomy that seemed sacrosanct can all too easily be overturned against the will of the majority,” Sizemore-Barber wrote. “Progress only occurs because people show up in force to make regression impossible.” 
Recently re-elected D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said in a press release that she is looking forward to WorldPride and hopes it will serve as an opportunity to celebrate the contributions that LGBTQ+ residents have made to the city and its culture.
“Pride in DC is a manifestation of our DC values, an opportunity for people to celebrate themselves and for our entire community to celebrate diversity and inclusivity,” Bowser said in the press release. “I couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate 50 years of Pride in D.C. than hosting the largest LGBTQ+ event and bringing together people from around the world.”
Thousands of international visitors are expected to come to D.C. for WorldPride. In the upcoming years, Capital Pride will be working on safety logistics to ensure that all visitors can enjoy themselves at this massive celebration. 
Sizemore-Barber said she hopes that the celebration will be a step forward in the United States becoming a prominent leader in visibility and acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community.
“For all that it is imperfectly enacted, America has long positioned itself as a global leader in LGBTQ rights,” Sizemore-Barber wrote.“By bringing WorldPride to DC, the event celebrates that legacy and, through mass visibility, will push the US to live up to its most inclusive ideals.”

The National Museum of African American History and Culture will open a new exhibit called “Afrofuturism: A History of Black Futures.” 
The exhibit —  to be located in the museum’s Bank of America Special Exhibitions Gallery — will open March 24, 2023, and remain open through March 2024. The main focus of the exhibit will be to examine Afrofuturist expression and culture as it pertains to music, activism, art and more. 
The new exhibit will seek to spotlight the ways Afrofuturism impacts popular culture and will present the movement as more than a subgenre of science fiction, according to museum curator Kevin Strait.
“Our hope is for audiences to be immersed in the concept by exploring Afrofuturist expression through literature, music, art, film, fashion, activism and visual media to get a sense of Afrofuturism’s historic, and poignant engagement with African American intellectual history and popular culture,” Strait wrote to The Hoya. 
Strait said the idea for an exhibit that tells stories of freedom and liberation through historical objects first arose in 2011 when the museum acquired P-Funk Mothership, the space vehicle model belonging to the funk musician George Clinton. 
Strait said he hopes that the broad range of cultural samples within the exhibit will allow visitors to see a new perspective and explore the history of Afrofuturism. 
“Our hope is for visitors to enjoy their visit and learn more about this topic by seeing the various ways that Afrofuturism connects with and influences our popular culture,” Strait wrote. “The exhibition emphasizes a broader understanding of Afrofuturism, not simply as a subgenre of science fiction and fantasy, but as part of a larger tradition of black intellectual history, with distinct roots that stretch across the Diaspora.”  
One notable inclusion in the exhibit is late actor Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther suit, which he wore in Marvel Studios’ 2018 film “Black Panther.” Boseman, a Howard University graduate, passed away in 2020 from colon cancer. Boseman’s character, Black Panther, quickly became an icon in Black pop culture after the film’s release. 
Strait said Boseman’s suit emphasizes the historical impact of the comic books and the impact of the film on audiences. 
“Displaying the Black Panther costume allows our audiences to engage with a piece of the film and Mr. Boseman’s legacy as well as exploring the huge impact the film, its characters and the setting of Wakanda has had on audiences worldwide,” Strait wrote. “It also allows us to explore the world of comics as bastions of Afrofuturist expression.”
Other notable pieces to be featured in the exhibit include author Octavia Butler’s typewriter, Nona Hendryx’s spacesuit-inspired costume and Nichelle Nichols’ “Star Trek” uniform. 
The exhibit also aims to tell stories of Black liberation through objects. The exhibit will also include the flight suit of Trayvon Martin, who dreamed of becoming an astronaut as a child.. Neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman shot and killed Martin in 2012, sparking national outrage and protests regarding racial profiling. 
Kevin Young, the Andrew W. Mellon Director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, said in a press release that the addition of Martin’s suit furthers the museum’s goal of incorporating themes of Black liberation and social equality in the exhibit. 
“Trayvon Martin’s flight suit tells the story of a dream of space flight ended tragically by earthbound violence,” Young said in the press release. “We are honored to tell more of Trayvon’s story, exploring his love of flight and mechanics and his fondness for science and technology. Afrofuturism charts the joy of a rich, imagined future, often in the face of injustice.”
Strait said he hopes that the exhibit will challenge stereotypes typically associated with the Black identity. 
“I think this exhibit also connects with our larger effort to add layers of understanding to one of the museum’s central narratives of ‘making a way out of no way’ — by exploring these new concepts and spaces of identity for African Americans, and challenging historical stereotypes associated with black identity,” Strait wrote. 
The new Afrofuturism exhibit will expand the way that the museum shares important elements of Black cultural identity, according to Strait.
“Exploring dynamic concepts like Afrofuturism by taking a look at its practice throughout history and across the Diaspora, and the ways it is expressed, historically and in the present, through art, literature, activism and more is a way for our museum to not only further engage with relevant cultural topics, but a way for us explore with our audience these alternative yet impactful and influential expressions of Black cultural identity,” Strait wrote.

The Georgetown Scholars Program (GSP) held its annual GSProud campaign to highlight the identities and achievements of Georgetown University’s first-generation and low-income (FGLI) students Nov. 14-18. 
The GSProud campaign, which launched in 2015, aims to celebrate FGLI students and build community among members of GSP, a program that supports FGLI students on campus. This year’s event, which was the first in-person celebration of GSProud since the COVID-19 pandemic began, featured events including a kickoff celebration on Healy Lawn, a game night, karaoke, a community dinner and a group photo of GSP members. 
Throughout the week, GSP posted on social media and designed a number of installations around campus, including GSP-themed chalk murals in Midnight Mug, the student run coffee shop in Lauinger Library, and Sellinger Lounge, as well as posters with pictures of GSP students in Red Square. The theme of this year’s GSProud week was embracing the voyage, celebrating the different paths students took to Georgetown and their contributions since arriving.
Sofia Chen Ma (MSB ’23), GSP’s student board president, said the theme was meant to highlight students’ diverse experiences before and during their time on the Hilltop. 
“We all have different journeys and different pathways in college, but we still, at the end of the day, we’re still GSP peers. So that’s the theme of embracing your journey at Georgetown and embracing the fact that you are a part of a very vibrant community,” Chen Ma told The Hoya. 
Colleen Roberts (COL ’15) , one of the founders of the campaign, said GSProud encourages conversations about disparities in wealth and socioeconomic status in the broader Georgetown community and normalizes the experiences of the FGLI community. 
“Money — and socioeconomic status — was not something that I was always comfortable talking about but GSP normalized the experiences of FGLI community,” Roberts wrote to The Hoya. “We created the GSProud campaign because it was an opportunity to extend that conversation beyond GSP and into the wider community.”
According to Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15), another founder of the GSProud campaign, GSP has previously partnered with other campus organizations to promote visibility of FGLI students.
“We did a partnership with The Corp where we talked about hiring across class levels,” Ramirez told The Hoya. “We did partnerships with Blue & Gray tour guides to have GSP spoken about on campus tours because not everyone on those tours comes from a family who can afford the Georgetown tuition.”
This year, GSProud has built on its original collaborations and partnered with Georgetown Mutual Aid to host an open-mic night, the GU Farmers Market to provide a 25% discount for GSP members and ESCAPE and the Women’s Center to share support for the program on social media. 
Missy Foy (COL ’03), executive director of GSP, said the GSProud campaign has shifted the culture around being a FGLI student at Georgetown. 
“The GSProud campaign was started by our student board several years ago to help students publicly and proudly self-identify as first-generation or low-income,” Foy wrote to The Hoya. “In GSP’s very early years, students sometimes felt ashamed of these identities; programs like GSProud, led by students, have really helped shift the culture to one of pride.”
Liang Lin (SOH ’24), a member of GSP, said GSProud fosters a sense of community among FGLI students. 
“It’s nice to see other students who are also FGLI being open about that part of their identity,” Lin told The Hoya. “There is some comfort in knowing who else is GSP and fostering a sense of comradery.”
Roberts said GSProud has grown tremendously from its original iteration.
“GSProud started with a social media campaign where we asked our friends to chime in on the chosen day,” Roberts wrote. “Today, GSProud is so much more — I still receive GSP emails and I see that it’s a full week, full of events and sustained conversations.”
