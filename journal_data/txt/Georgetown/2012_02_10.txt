The seven Georgetown University Student Association presidential tickets kicked off their campaigns Thursday at midnight, marking the start of what will be a two-week race.
This year’s field is almost entirely comprised of candidates with past GUSA experience; 10 of the 14 presidential and vice presidential candidates are members of the current senate or executive cabinet.
Several candidates plan to base their campaigns on the need for better engagement between GUSA and the student body.
“We think that outreach and GUSA as an institution need to be flipped inside out, and we need to be going out into the community instead of expecting the community to come to us,” GUSA Director of Special Projects Tyler Sax (COL ’13), a presidential candidate, said.
Sax and his running mate Michael Crouch (MSB ‘13), current GUSA secretary of information and technology, have proposed an executive department designed to foster student outreach. If elected, they hope to build a cabinet made of representatives from student groups on campus.
Presidential candidate Senate Vice Speaker Nate Tisa (COL ’14) and vice presidential candidate and current senator and Finance and Appropriations Committee Vice Chair Sheila Walsh (COL ’14) hope to better represent the student body by promoting diversity both inside and outside of the student government. They are the only all-sophomore ticket.
“We had to be able to form [the campaign team] this year because if we waited in the wings until it was our turn next year, then … the problems with diversity, with structure of student government would perpetuate themselves further,” Tisa said.
GUSA senators Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), who make up one ticket, praised the current executive administration for becoming more open to students than past administrations had been but said they believe that GUSA can still be more proactive in engaging with students.
“We want to actively reach out to students and get their opinions, find out their concerns and answer their questions,” Kohnert-Yount, who is running for vice president, said.
Current GUSA President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) have spent the past few months trying to ensure that their initiatives, including the Student Advocacy Office and the 2012 Student Life Report, will continue with the next administration. Many of the candidates emphasized the importance of continuing and expanding upon these programs.
The ticket made up of GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff John Morris (COL ’13) and Lauren Weber (COL ’13), a member of The Hoya’s board of directors, hope to broaden the scope of the SAO, which counsels students accused of disciplinary violations and advises them on a number of issues they may face when dealing with the school administration.
Candidates have also proposed several new initiatives.
Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), GUSA senator and Finance and Appropriations Committee chair, and Maggie Cleary (COL ‘14), director of executive outreach, issued a 20-page agenda detailing proposals ranging from a Georgetown Zipcar fleet to increasing minors available across all of the undergraduate schools. They intend to hold themselves to these proposals by adding a Campaign Promise Tracker to the GUSA Website.
“Now the best way for GUSA to improve is to deliver on proposals that matter to students and actually get things done,” Malkerson, the presidential candidate, said.
GUSA Fund Chair Murphy Kate Delaney (COL ’13) and Michael Appau (COL ’13) plan to increase the number of ways that GUSA impacts the daily life of a student.
“We see that other student governments at other schools provide student services that GUSA doesn’t have an emphasis on,” Delaney, the presidential candidate, said.
GUSA senator Daniel LaMagna (COL ’13), who is running for president with Markel Starks (COL ’14) as his vice president, declined to comment on his ticket’s platform. Starks is the second men’s basketball player in two years to run for vice president; Henry Sims (COL ’12) ran last year.
The election will be held Feb. 23. It will be preceded by a presidential debate Feb. 12 and a vice presidential debate Feb. 14.
“Seeing the start of the campaign is a little bittersweet because Mike and I have enjoyed our time so much, but I look forward to the two people who will succeed us, and I hope it’s a well thought-out and well run campaign,” Laverriere said.

The architects working to restore Dahlgren Chapel unveiled plans for renovations to the building’s interior at a meeting Tuesday.
Most of the intended changes, which include moving the organ from the rear of the chapel to behind the altar, are intended to increase the amount of seating. According to Jim Wickman, director of music and liturgy, a new organ will have to be constructed for the chapel.
“The new organ will utilize some parts of the old organ,” he said. “We’re still in the interviewing process of hiring an organ builder.”
Students, faculty and priests who attended the meeting raised questions about where the tabernacle and choir would be located if the organ were to be moved. Some voiced concern that the tabernacle would take up too much space if it were moved to share an already tight space with the choir behind the altar, and suggested moving the choir to the rear of the chapel or keeping the tabernacle in its original spot to the right of the altar.
An accurate timeline for the completion of the interior design project has not yet been fully formed. According to Sean Reilly, the principal architect for the project, the deadlines will largely depend on fundraising, which has not yet begun in earnest.
Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., vice president for mission and ministry, was delighted with the variety of the recommendations.
“Great feedback, good suggestions,” he said. “That’s why we have meetings like this.”
The $7.5 million project to restore the 118-year-old chapel, which began last semester, was funded in large part by a $6 million donation from Francis (CAS ’75, LAW ’78) and Kathleen (SFS ’77) Rooney.
The renovations are largely designed to repair significant water damage to the chapel’s foundation.
Although a follow-up meeting has not yet been scheduled, some students are already looking forward to providing more feedback.
“I’m very excited because I think having this discussion in the first place is very meaningful,” AlexPodkul (COL ’13) said. “It’s a meaningful dialogue that we’re going to have, especially in the next couple of months.”

President Obama’s recently announced plan to tie federal aid programs to tuition hikes in order to offset rising costs of college garnered approval from university administrators.
“I’m telling Congress we should steer federal campus-based aid to those colleges that keep tuition affordable, provide good value and serve their students well,” Obama said in a Jan. 27 speech at the University of Michigan.
Georgetown’s Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said that the university shares the president’s goal of making education more affordable.
“Georgetown has a longstanding commitment to making a Georgetown education accessible to all qualified students,” Fleming said. “It is reflected in our need-blind admissions and full-need financial aid policies that date back to the 1980s.”
Fleming lauded Obama’s plan because it ties federal funding to net tuition paid after accounting for financial aid, rather than the total tuition.
He added that despite the high total tuition cost, Georgetown students graduate with about half the average national debt rate.
The president’s plan involves expanding the Perkins Loan Program budget from $1 billion to $8 billion, and increasing funding for Federal Work Study. According to Fleming, the two programs are major components of most Georgetown students’ financial aid packages.
In his speech, Obama announced that he aims to reward “good value” in education with increased federal funding. The program would involve grading schools on their total costs, graduation rates, student loan repayment rates, average student loan debt and graduates’ earning potential.
Georgetown graduates’ low level of student debt default sets up the university to score well under the new system, according to Fleming. But he stressed that the full effects of the new policy are still unclear.
“There are still questions to be answered with regard to the specifics of the president’s proposal,” Fleming said. “We expect to see further details when his budget is released next week.”

Students of Georgetown, Inc. made record profits in 2011, marking a return to profitability after two years of losses.
The Corp’s executives hope to use the new profits to focus on long-term value for its student shareholders.
“Something I’ve always tried to engender in our employees is that when we make money we are much better able to help other students,” CFO R. Scott Munro (COL ’12) said.
According to the company’s Annual Report 2011, which was released Monday, The Corp’s services made $244,384.17 in total net income for fiscal year 2011. The figure represents a five percent increase from 2010. The Corp recorded net losses of $181,745 and $10,418 in 2009 and 2010, respectively.
Munro said that the return to profitability after two years in the red is the result of institutional repricing in Vital Vittles and significant increases in investment returns, despite rising expenses.
The Corp’s administrative policies have historically fostered a focus on giving back to students rather than increasing profits, a tradition that incoming CFO Vidur Khatri (MSB ’14) hopes to continue.
“If we have a healthy bottom line, we can give back in the most creative way,” he said. “If we have a healthy bottom line, we can prepare for the future.”
In the coming years, The Corp hopes to open a location in the New South Student Center, slated to be completed in August 2014, and invest more in student entrepreneurship and innovation. Munro foresees possible price cuts as well, stating that serving students remains a priority.
“We’re trying to move away from throwing money at a problem … [and] toward improving the campus is a significant way,” he said.

United States Ambassador to Japan John Roos provided an on-the-ground perspective of Japan and its allies’ response to 2011’s earthquake and nuclear disaster Wednesday.
The event, sponsored by the Office of the President and the School of Foreign Service’s Asian studies program, highlighted the strength of the U.S.-Japanese alliance.
On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami with 65-foot waves and four subsequent nuclear reactor explosions in Japan. Roos called the ensuing destruction the world’s first mega-disaster.
Beginning his lecture with a video that depicted the large-scale devastation caused by the disaster, Roos said that Japan’s recovery from the tragedy was impressive.
“Experts have told me that in almost any other nation the destruction would have been far greater if not for Japan’s structural engineering, technical expertise, and … resources,” he said.
Roos added that U.S. contributions were integral to relief efforts. After the earthquake struck, the United States dispatched the Disaster Assistance Response Team and nuclear experts from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to the site.
“The speed and flexibility of our military and disaster relief experts was truly impressive, as was Japan’s Self-Defense Forces who led the entire effort,” Roos said.
Roos also discussed the role that technology played in the relief effort. Using outlets such as Youtube, Facebook and Twitter, embassy members made an effort to maintain the dissemination of information.
“I must admit that even having come from Silicon Valley, I underestimated the power of Twitter prior to the crisis, when it was an absolutely vital communications tool,” Roos said. “It gave us the ability to communicate quickly and respond to events on the ground in real time.”
Roos noted that Japan continues to combat the consequences of the disaster. Many coastal inhabitants reside in temporary housing, and concerns about radiation and economic damage linger.
“A major element of our support for Japan now is in convincing the world that Japan is a safe place to visit and to do business,” Roos said.
The ambassador concluded by emphasizing Japan’s importance to the U.S., citing its large role in national security, the world economy and global climate policy.
“The U.S. not only needs Japan, but a Japan that is stronger than before,” he said.

In a city where over 3,500 aggravated assault offenses were reported in 2010, Georgetown and its student groups are stepping up efforts to ensure that community members are better prepared to deal with instances of violent crime.
The university offers self-defense courses through the Department of Public Safety and Yates Field House as its primary means of preventative education. The classes teach both physical and nonphysical ways to thwart attacks.
Since the 1970s, Yates has offered a judo program, which brings in black-belt experts to instruct participants of any skill level or gender. In the past, Yates offered gender-specific women’s self-defense classes, but the program was cut due to the difficulty of finding time and space to conduct the program.
Similarly, the Georgetown Israel Alliance has brought instructors to campus to teach Krav Maga, the self-defense program used by the Israeli Defense Forces. The group is planning to publicize future events for the program more widely.
“Krav Maga is very applicable,” club president Ben Talus (SFS ’14) said. “It can be used if you are walking down the streets of D.C.”
DPS offers a gender-specific self-defense training program, Rape Aggression Defense. RAD is a 12-hour course that aims to supply female students, faculty and staff with the necessary skills to defend themselves in the event of sexual assault.
RAD is a crucial component of the larger programs offered to support students, according to JenSchweer, the sexual assault and relationship violence services coordinator with Health Education Services.
“The RAD program offered by DPS is a piece of a comprehensive approach in talking about safety issues,” Schweer said. “Education, awareness, survivor services and perpetrator accountability are also critical parts of the process. We need all of these pieces in order to fully address the issue of violence.”
But Mike Balsan (COL ’12), president of GU Men of Strength, worries that an emphasis on such programs may have unintended consequences. Laura Kovach, director of the Georgetown University Women’s Center, shares his concern.
“Self-defense may be effective, but focusing on self-defense puts the onus of protection on the victim, not the perpetrator,” Kovach said. “We believe that self-defense is only one component of a comprehensive approach to addressing gender-based violence. One thing we stress is that even if you take a self-defense workshop and you experience an assault, it’s not your fault. No matter what, it’s never the victim’s fault.”
Balsan’s group, formerly known as GU Men Creating Change, seeks to foster a campus environment where self-defense is not considered a necessity. In order to address the root causes of violence against women, Men of Strength offers bystander intervention workshops. The workshops, which take place in small groups in residence halls, bring in professional facilitators from the nonprofit organization Men Can Stop Rape. Participants learn strategies to diffuse situations and distract perpetrators as well as basic crisis management skills to assist victims after an attack.
“You should not feel like you have to know self-defense or have to buy mace,” Balsan said.
In honor of Women’s History Month, the Women’s Center also plans to hold a self-defense workshop open to all genders in March.

Ten months after the certification of their union, workers for Georgetown University Dining Services and their employer, Aramark Higher Education, have tentatively agreed upon a three-year employment contract.
The agreement reached Tuesday between Aramark and the negotiating committee is subject to the approval of the union, which is comprised of workers in O’Donovan Hall, the Jesuit Residence, Cosi, Starbucks and the Pre-Clinical Science Building’s Dr. Mug. Members of the union will meet in the coming weeks to discuss the proposed contract.
The agreement includes significant gains for the employees, including a 50-cent-per-hour wage increase for each of the three years. Aramark has also agreed to cover 80 percent of employees’ healthcare costs for the next two years and 85 percent during the third year of the contract.
Samuel Geaney-Moore (SFS ’12), who has been involved in assisting Leo’s employees, believes that last week’s lunchtime demonstration by union members was an important part of moving negotiations along.
“I think the recent demonstration in the cafeteria was essential in showing [Aramark] that the workers are united and [have] significant support from the student body,” he said.
Leo’s employee and negotiation committee member Tarshea Smith said she was grateful to the students involved in the demonstration and those who supported the formation of the union last spring.
“I think the students played a big role in us getting together. If the students weren’t behind us, I don’t think the negotiating committee would have been as strong,” she said.
Smith added that last week’s demonstration was particularly significant because all of the Leo’s managers happened to be on site.
“They must have called the negotiators at Aramark and said to them, ‘These people aren’t playing around,'” she said.
The university reacted positively to the news, according to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr.
“We are pleased that Aramark and the union worked collaboratively to reach an agreement that honors Georgetown University’s just employment policy,” she wrote in an email.

GUSA plans to distribute a student rights pamphlet before spring break as part of its larger efforts to keep students informed about the codes regulating student behavior on campus.
According to Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12), the pamphlet will cover the campus judicial process, as well as the roles of the Student Advocacy Office, Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service, Department of Public Safety, Student Neighborhood Assistance Program and Metropolitan Police Department.
“It doesn’t deal with everything. It’s a condensed-down version of the code of conduct,” Laverriere said.
According to GUSA Chief of Staff Mike Barclay (COL ’12), the pamphlet is an attempt to update a similar publication that was put together by GUSA and The Corp in 2004.
“It gives people the resources they need to look for in the original code,” he said.
The pamphlet is currently under review by Director of Student Conduct Judy Johnson to ensure that its content accurately reflects the university’s code of conduct.
The student rights pamphlet, along with the Bill of Student Rights and Responsibilities and revisions to the Student Code of Conduct, is part of GUSA’s effort to take a comprehensive look at the code and increase student awareness of their rights.
“With the student rights pamphlet and the Student Advocacy Office, we’re trying to provide two different resources that can make students more knowledgeable about the code and their responsibilities,”Laverriere said.
He added that GUSA’s experience with the SAO so far has reinforced the ongoing push to reform the code of conduct. The two most significant proposed changes to the code are increasing the burden of proof requirement and renewing the focus on communicating student rights throughout the judicial process.
The proposed revisions would raise the burden of proof of code of conduct violations from “more likely than not” to “clear and convincing” in all cases, with the exception of sexual assaults. The change of language is intended to protect students from being penalized in cases with limited evidence.
The reform would also require the Office of Student Conduct to notify students of the resources available to them in the disciplinary emails and to allow students on trial to pause an active session and consult with an adviser.
“Some may consider those as nominal changes, but I disagree,” Laverriere said. “Anything that you can put into the code of conduct to clarify the process that further increases and clears up what a student has the ability to do in a hearing or administrative action is very helpful.”
According to Laverriere, the revision process will continue after the election of a new GUSA president and vice president. All the proposed changes are still subject to approval by the university’s Disciplinary Review Committee.
“It’s a longer process than we originally anticipated, but it’s definitely a thoughtful one,” Barclay said.

William J. Doyle (CAS ’72) was received as a guest of honor at Georgetown Thursday in recognition of his recent $10 million gift to the university.
Doyle, the president and CEO of fertilizer company PotashCorp, and his wife Kathy made the monetary contribution that endows the Doyle Initiative, an effort to encourage tolerance and diversity at Georgetown, in October.
“As the world got larger and more connected, we became less connected in terms of sensitivity to one another,” Doyle said. “I think we all have prejudices, myself included. It’s almost impossible to get through life up to age 18 without any prejudices or preconceived notions.”
The gift was recognized at the annual Doyle Engaging Difference Symposium, which was followed by a celebration in Riggs Library held by the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs and the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship.
The Doyle Initiative was founded on a trial basis three years ago with the help of an earlier donation from the Doyles and has been led by Dean Chester Gillis, Director of the Berkley Center ThomasBanchoff and English professor Randy Bass.
The faculty team has worked to integrate its thematic values with classroom curriculum through initiatives including undergraduate fellows seminars – four-credit classes that are accompanied by a research project – and a junior year abroad network. All of the initiative’s programs are run through the Berkley Center.
Doyle chose to permanently endow the program due to its success so far.
According to Doyle, his time as an undergraduate at Georgetown during the late 1960s and early 1970sinfluenced his commitment to fighting prejudice.
“It was a time of tremendous idealism, and I don’t think we ever lost that sense of idealism for a better, peaceful world,” he said.
Doyle has maintained a close relationship with the university since his graduation.
“I can’t imagine any other school better equipped to take on this subject matter because we educate the whole person,” he said. “There’s a difference here. Georgetown has a soul.”
Doyle gave his first gift of $20 to the university while working as a sales trainee in the agricultural industry immediately after graduating.
“We need to make it possible for the next generation to have [the] same experience [I did],” he said. “If you can donate beer money one Friday night, that will make a difference.”

Longtime Democratic Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans remains unopposed in the leadup to the Democratic primary for what may be his sixth consecutive successful election.
Because the city consistently votes Democrat, the April 3 primary will likely be the only relevant election for Evans, who has held his seat for 20 years.
According to Evans, potential challengers have asked around the community and found little enthusiasm for an opposing candidate.
“They were told by virtually everyone that we were doing a great job and they wouldn’t support anyone else,” he said.
According to Ken Archer, who chaired Fiona Greig’s short-lived campaign against Evans in the fall, the lack of competition is problematic.
“Any election … is better contested just to have a dialogue,” he said. “That dialogue is healthy, and it gets the residents engaged in the issues. It’s easy not knowing what’s going on at the council, and thedialogue is there to remind everyone of the decisions that [the council] makes. That’s not happening thistime.”
But Archer said that he talked extensively with Evans after Grieg’s campaign collapsed last November, and he now endorses the councilmember’s attempt at a sixth term.
According to Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Chair Ron Lewis, Evan’s lack of opposition can be attributed to his widespread support.
“He’s done such a good job and people know how strong the ANCs support him that no one wants to run against him,” Lewis said. “It’s a tribute, really, to the success of his performance.”
Evans has consistently fared well in D.C. elections, typically defeating his opponents by at least 30 points in both primary and general contests.
His candidacy hasn’t been seriously contested since 1991, when he received 31 percent of the vote in a special election held after previous Ward 2 Councilmember John Wilson won his bid for council chairman.
Though Evans is the one of four councilmembers up for re-election who is currently running unopposed, he is among several longtime incumbents on the council.
Democratic Ward 8 Councilmember Marion Barry served as D.C. mayor for 16 years and has held his seat on the council since 2004. Democratic At-Large Member Vincent Orange was Ward 5councilmember for eight years before launching an unsuccessful bid for mayor in 2006. He was re-elected to the council last year in a special election for a vacant at-large seat, which he hopes to retain this election cycle.
While political races often favor incumbents, College Democrats Vice President and Communications Director for D.C. Students Speak Jason Gerson (COL ’14) said that the District’s lack of statehood increases the likelihood that incumbents run for and win re-election multiple times.
“D.C. politics have always been tremendously complex. … In another state, a city councilman becomes a county commissioner, a county commissioner becomes a state representative, a state representative becomes a state senator, a state senator becomes a congressman, a state attorney general or other major statewide role,” Gerson said. “In D.C., the only roles are councilmember, council chairman, mayor, and ANC commissioner, so it’s less likely that incumbents vacate their old seats in the hopes of a promotion.”

The D.C. Zoning Commission decided to delay its ruling on the university’s 2010 Campus Plan until April at what was intended to be the sixth and final hearing on the plan Thursday night.
The meeting was the third time the commission has put off announcing a final verdict on the plan, which was originally slated for a vote in June of last year.
At the meeting, commissioners said that they were still uncertain about the effectiveness of measures the university has implemented in the past year to address neighborhood grievances. The commission agreed to reconvene April 30, delaying its final ruling until data from the entire academic year becomes available.
“I think it was a bit disappointing that they decided to postpone,” Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) said after attending the meeting. “But I think they want to do their due diligence and make sure they have their facts right, which is commendable.”
Though they reiterated neighborhood concerns, commissioners also said they were reluctant to force Georgetown to house all of its undergraduate students on university-owned property. The Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, Burleith Citizens Association and Citizens Association of Georgetown have consistently demanded such a policy.
“Requiring the university to house 100 percent of its undergraduates on campus is something in my book [that] I’m not sure is reasonable or achievable,” Commissioner Andrew May said.
But commissioners also agreed that the current presence of students in the neighborhood is unacceptable.
“The university has to come up with a better solution for off-campus housing so we can lessen some of the impacts on the surrounding area,” Commission Chairman Anthony Hood said.
May suggested that the university find a way of making the option to live off-campus a privilege that students must earn, rather than a right.
“It’s the university’s responsibility to find a better solution,” Hood said.
University spokeswoman Stacy Kerr said that while the university stands by the measures it has adopted to date, it is eager to continue the search for creative solutions to neighborhood concerns.
“Being a good neighbor is a responsibility we take very seriously, as evidenced by the many resources we have voluntarily put into improving the quality of life for our near neighbors and for our entire community,” Kerr wrote in an email. “We look forward to continuing to engage in conversations that result in mutually beneficial solutions for all of the stakeholders involved.”
Zoning Commission Vice-Chairman Konrad Schlater attempted to shift some of the blame away from the university, stressing that while it is responsible for ensuring all stakeholders are satisfied, municipal services must also play an active role in addressing neighborhood concerns.
“We need better coordination with the [District Department of Transportation] for parking enforcement and the [Department of Public Works] for trash enforcement,” Schlater said. “When you have a house that’s leaving trash, that is the responsibility of [the] District government.”
Schlater added that the commission should exercise caution in restricting the university’s ability to grow.
“It bears repeating that Georgetown is the largest private employer in D.C.,” he said. “When unemployment is high, economic impact from this university is very high, so when we’re talking about the expansion of the professional schools and the graduate school and graduate students, along with that comes jobs, and that’s something I want to make sure we keep in mind.”
Laverriere said he was encouraged by Schlater’s testimony and hopes that the commission will come to a decision soon so that the university can move forward with the projects proposed in the plan.
“The university needs this issue to be resolved at some point,” he said. “The longer we hold this up, the longer it’s going to be before we can start with everything we want to do in this plan.”

Students from several D.C. universities gathered Thursday morning to show support for new federal regulations that require most religiously affiliated employers to provide coverage for birth control in their health care plans.
The ruling has ignited a heated debate between those who consider the mandate a violation of religious freedom and organizations that support the new policy.
Catholic Students for Women’s Health, an organization which includes pro-choice groups from American, Catholic and Fordham Universities, held a press conference at the National Press Club to address the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ objection to the mandate.
H*yas for Choice Outreach Coordinator Tanisha Humphrey (COL ’12), who spoke at the conference, said that the purpose of the event was to lend support to the mandate and to let bishops know that not all Catholics agree with their views on birth control.
“Catholic women use contraceptives at the same rate as their non-Catholic peers,” she said. “It’s important for Catholic women [and] Catholic students to stand up and say that this is something that’s important to us, too, and that being Catholic is not synonymous with being against birth control.”
Headliners at the event included former Lt. Gov. of Maryland Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who addressed the necessity of separation between church and state.
“The bishops should not use the power of government to do the things they [themselves] cannot do,” she said.
Catholic University student Erick Orantes added that men have an important role to play in the ongoing debate.
“Men should rise with women to fight the injustices that shake society,” he said.
Kieran Raval (COL ’13), a Grand Knight of the Knights of Columbus, disagreed with the conference’s take on the issue, noting that the mandate is not a question of health but rather of religious freedom under the First Amendment.
“It perplexes me what these folks are actually protesting,” he said. “What’s under attack here is the right of the church to practice its religion without interference.”
“The vast number of the American people are not comfortable with [the mandate],” he added. “When religious liberty is attacked for one church, what’s to say that the government isn’t going to tell Muslims to eat pork or order the Amish to give up their lifestyles?”
Humphrey hoped that the conference would make university administrators aware of student opinion on the legislation.
“I think it is important for university officials to realize that their students are invested in this and that we care and that we’re not going to just be silent while they decide about our health concerns,” she said. “Catholic, non-Catholic; this is a women’s issue.”

It was a winding road that brought Twister Murchison (SFS ’08) to Hollywood, and the Georgetown University Student Association played an important supporting role.
Murchison, who is now assistant to the vice president of animation at 20th Century Fox, points to his tenure as GUSA president, which began in the spring of 2006, as one of the formative moments of his career.
“I learned the value of persistence when I was in GUSA,” he says.
Although it has been almost six years since his term ended, Murchison is quick to recall the highlights of his time in office. In late 2006, he successfully mobilized the student body against a university-sponsored ban on kegs. He also enacted a constitutional amendment that established the student senate. Both are accomplishments which he is still proud to talk about.
Former GUSA presidents have found their way to places from Hollywood, like Murchison, to Wall Street, where last year’s president Calen Angert (MSB ’11) now works.
But while their accomplishments as president are left behind after graduation, Murchison and others say the lessons they learned in office stay with them.
“Coming from Georgetown and being in GUSA, you meet so many people from all these different backgrounds, and it’s great training because out here, you have to be ready to talk to just about anybody,” Murchison says.
After graduating in 2005, former GUSA President Kelley Hampton (SFS ’05, LAW ’10, GRD ’10) went on to collect two more Georgetown degrees. She now works at a non-profit called Break the Cycle, which reaches out to victims of domestic and dating violence.
Though she initially thought that she would go into government, Hampton says that controversy during her campaign caused her to reconsider those plans. Although Hampton won the presidential election, the GUSA Election Commission delayed her inauguration for two months while it debated the legality of fliers her campaign placed in The Hoya.
“Every year there is some kind of turmoil that happens during elections, and my year was no different. That taught me a lot about being political, and I wasn’t really ready to be political,” she laughs.
While campaigning, Hampton met a group of student activists who piqued her interest in women’s rights issues. She decided to go to law school to study the normative side of government and found employment as an activist for women’s rights.
“I think at Georgetown, or any college for that matter, there are certain groups you are going to run into, and then some you don’t. GUSA really pushes you to open up and meet a lot of people that you otherwise wouldn’t have met,” Hampton says.
While the campaign trail schooled presidents like Murchison and Hampton in personal relations, it was serving as president that indoctrinated them in the financial side of university operations. Between balancing budgets and lobbying for funding, GUSA presidents become well versed in financial planning.
“I definitely got a better understanding of the business aspect of the school,” Hampton says.
GUSA President from 2001 to 2002 Tawan Davis (COL ’01), for example, works both as the vice president of New York City’s Economic Development Corporation and as an adjunct professor of finance at New York University.
Perhaps most important for these former presidents was the opportunity to polish their leadership skills early in their careers. Pravin Rajan (SFS ’07), a Rhodes scholar, a captain in the Marine Corps andGUSA president from 2005 to 2006, jokes that he weeded out many of his leadership faults during his term.
“It was definitely amazing leadership experience. I learned many, many things that I will never do again. Many things,” he says. “I don’t know how great of a leader I was at the time. I think I just surrounded myself with smart people, and I definitely use a lot of those leadership skills in the Marine Corps.”
Murchison, Hampton, Davis, Rajan and Angert still joke about their missteps in office and remember their greatest triumphs, along with the relationships they formed.
“I still talk to all my GUSA friends, too, all the time. Those are my closest friends from Georgetown,”Murchison says. “I look back on that time when I was really stressed, but I loved what I was doing, and I’m proud of what we did.
