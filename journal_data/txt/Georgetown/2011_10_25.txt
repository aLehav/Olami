More than 100 students representing a variety of campus organizations gathered Sunday night to launch the Student Group Union, an initiative designed to facilitate better coordination among student clubs.
Held in Copley Formal Lounge, the event served as a platform for organizers to explain their mission to represent and advocate for all student groups while pressing the leaders of various organizations to sign the SGU constitution in the coming weeks.
“This is an overarching group that will be addressing a variety of issues,” SGU steering committee member Eitan Paul (SFS ’12) said. “A lot of effort will be needed to unite all of the different structures of government on campus.”
Once the constitution is adopted, elections for the SGU’s executive committee will be held. The committee will be comprised of one representative each from 10 designated categories of student organizations: media, performing arts, volunteer, advocacy, cultural, political, common interest, club sports, student government and non-advisory board groups.
However, some students at the kickoff expressed concern about the process of classifying the groups. Others questioned whether all clubs would be equally represented within the SGU.
“Ideally, we hope to get the same number of groups under category, but we also recognize that some groups are comprised of a greater number of students,” Paul said. “We are still currently working this out and are willing to receive feedback from every group.”
The event started out with two students sharing their frustrations about the difficulties they face trying to communicate and coordinate space reservations.
Mary Boyle (COL ’14), event planner for the club volleyball team, said this environment dampened the general enthusiasm for club sports on campus.
“Communication between the Yates Field House and club sports is tedious,” she said. “If club sports work as a team, the communication platform provided by the SGU will enable the needs of each group to be met more efficiently.”
Aman Shahi (COL ’13), co-captain of GU Jawani, described similar experiences for performing arts groups. He described the groups Thursday night practices in their cramped space.
“We can’t hear our own songs clearly. Worse of all, it’s crowded, and it smells. A simply solution would just be the dance groups getting together regularly and figuring out a group calendar. But so far no platform … of communication has been formed,” he said.
While one of the core goals of the union is to advocate on behalf of student groups to the administration and to funding boards, James Pickens (COL ’12) said that the SGU has the potential to improve efficiency by creating a platform for communication.
“The SGU can solve a lot of problems without talking to the administration,” he said. “For example, club sports would only have to gather together to work out conflicting practice schedules without every single one of them talking to the Yates Field House. By eliminating the middleman in the university, everything could become easier and faster.”
Similarly, students at the kickoff  suggested an organized platform that gathers useful information that many student groups may be unaware of.
Michael Fischer (SFS ’13), a former columnist for The Hoya, suggested that the group could better advertise the opportunities and funding sponsored by student groups available for students. “SGU should be able to organize and incorporate all of this information,” he said.

The District Department of Transportation will need to repair 215 D.C. area bridges in that were pronounced structurally deficient in a report by Transportation for America.
The classification singles out bridges in need of substantial repairs or replacement.
In the report, which was released Wednesday, over 69,223 bridges were listed as structurally deficient. An average of 3,611,401 drivers travel the bridges classified as deficient every day, according to the report.
John Lisle, public information officer for DDOT, said that many of the D.C. bridges listed in the report underwent rehabilitation soon after the Federal Highway Administration released a similar report in 2009. Plans for repairs on the remainder of the bridges are in the works.
The Key Bridge, stretching from Georgetown to Rosslyn, Va., will undergo repairs in the next two to four years, according to Lisle. In the meantime, contractors will inspect the bridge every six months.
“It’s listed as structurally deficient but there’s nothing that needs to be done right now,” Lisle said. “Just because they’re listed as structurally deficient does not mean that they are a danger to the public or not safe; that is not the case. … It means they are due for repair work.”
Other bridges in the area have already undergone repairs. According to Lisle, the Kenilworth Avenue Bridge, the Eastern Avenue Bridge and the Ninth Street Northwest Bridge are now completely reconstructed. He added that pier strengthening and deck remodeling is almost completed on the 14th Street Bridge.
Both local government and the federal government contribute to the costs of the repairs through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
Despite the worries about the District’s infrastructure, Lisle assured residents and commuters of the bridges’ safety and ensured quick responses to faulty structures.
“We inspect them on a regular basis, and our bridges are safe.” he said.

Georgetown’s Master of Business Administration program scored the 54th spot in a new study of the top 150 international universities from which CEOs and chairmen of leading companies hire.
After surveying business leaders from 10 different countries between Nov. 2010 and Jan. 2011, French consulting firm Emerging and German partner Trendence compiled a list of the elite MBA programs from around the world.
Universities were issued a set number of points for each company that named it as one of the top schools from which it drew job candidates. A university that received a vote from an executive native to its country of origin received one point. Votes cast for a school in a participant’s home continent counted for 1.5 points, while those issued for overseas institutions were worth 2 points.
Harvard University and Stanford University nabbed the top two spots, followed by Yale University.
Though Georgetown’s ranking of 54th placed it behind these American schools, the MBA program remained ahead of many  other regional competitors. New York University, the University of Notre Dame and Vanderbilt University received rankings of 66th, 83rd and 89th respectively.
Doreen Amorosa, the associate dean and managing director of the Georgetown MBA Career Center, said the school’s ranking is a result of the administration’s efforts to boost the desirability of its graduates in the global job market.
According to Amorosa, Georgetown’s MBA Program appeals to businesses because its students are required to balance curriculum, career and community.
“Employers find that MSB students are well equipped with the leadership skills, technical knowledge, collaborative approach and career development tools needed to be successful,” she said.

It is a crisp, Sunday morning in mid-October, and Ivan Plis (SFS ’12) is awakened sharply by the sound of his 7 a.m. alarm. He dresses, says his prayers, laces up a comfortable pair of shoes and prepares for his mile-and-a-half walk to St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church for a morning service.
When he arrives at St. Nicholas, Plis enters through one of the side doors, making the Sign of the Cross while venerating icons along the walls.
“It is like coming into a house and greeting family members,” he said.
He proceeds to take his seat in the upper section of the church where he sings tenor for the choir. As he walks in, the congregation mills around him, since the worshiping space lacks traditional pews and possesses few chairs.
For Plis, the walk up Massachusetts Avenue with a few other Orthodox Christian Georgetown students is just part of his weekly routine.
“I made the effort to find other students of Orthodox background as soon as I knew I was going to Georgetown,” Plis said.
Soon after arriving to school, he became involved with Orthodox Chaplaincy on campus, regularly attending vespers, a traditional prayer service in the Orthodox Christian religion with other students on Tuesday evenings in Copley Crypt.
Though Georgetown offers Vespers on campus, they are not the same as the Divine Liturgy for Plis, who explains that the liturgy is an integral part of worship for Orthodox Christians.
To participate in this form of faith service, Plis must venture beyond the gates, to the heart of the District.
A TRADITION ROOTED IN ACCEPTANCE
According to Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., the university has a longstanding tradition of providing resources for students of different faiths.
“[Georgetown’s founder] John Carroll … experienced discrimination as a Catholic in Maryland,” O’Brien said. “So when he opened up his academy on the Potomac, he wanted it to be open to different faiths.
O’Brien added that the diversity of students on campus contributes to those students’ decisions to worship beyond the gates.
“There are so many expressions of Christianity that often students go off campus,” he said. “We offer ample worship and retreat opportunities on campus, but we do help students worship in other faith communities.”
Beth Hatch, the university’s Protestant program coordinator, said that many Protestant students often seek a more family-oriented community in the city.
“People go off campus for a range of things — they want a style of worship or a supplement to what they are getting. Mostly what I’ve heard students talking about is wanting to be part of a multigenerational church,” she said.
Hatch said that, while her office does offer on-campus worship opportunities, she hopes students choose whichever church setting they find most comfortable.
“We have a traditional service and a gospel service to hopefully try and meet students’ needs, but we also want to help point students toward communities that will be what they’re looking for,” she said.
 
FINDING A HOME IN A HOUSE OF WORSHIP
Many students on the Hilltop consider their off-campus religious institutions a kind of home away from home.
Though Dahlgren Chapel lies in the middle of campus, some Catholic students, like Mike Croglio (NHS ’14), prefer the community atmosphere at Holy Trinity Church, a mere block from Healy Gates on 36th Street.
“It is out of habit that I started [going] to Mass there. I like being in a parish,” Croglio said. “I’ve been going to Church with my parents for as long as I can remember, so it was sort of a reminder of home.”
According to Judith Brusseau, who has been the pastoral associate for faith formation at Holy Trinity for 11 years, students are an essential part of Holy Trinity’s past and present.
“Georgetown students have always played a part in supporting the parish at Holy Trinity as members of the Confirmation team or as catechists,” she said.
The appeal of these off-campus faith communities extends to other Christians, too.
Frank Miller (COL ’14), a member of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, finds his religious home at a Ukrainian Church in Northeast D.C.
Miller, who takes a bus and the Metro for one hour to reach his destination, said that attending services there reminds him of his heritage.
“In my experience, attending Liturgy at the Ukrainian Church is both a matter of family heritage and personal preference,” he said.
A COMMUNITY OF THEIR OWN
For Georgetown’s Mormon students, carving out a niche for worship in the District requires leaving city bounds altogether.
Every Sunday, in a van provided by the university, a group of Mormon students travels to the temple in Chevy Chase, Md., at 10:30 a.m., spending the day there until services wrap up at 3 p.m.
For Grace Brown (COL ’14), who was raised in the Mormon tradition, the commute provides structure to her week.
“It’s a good routine that I enjoy,” she said of the trips to the temple. “I like being able to get off campus.”
For a contingent of six or seven Mormon students on campus, attending these services reminds them of their faith community’s global reach.
“[Since] our Church is [universal], wherever you go, it is similar,” fellow Mormon student Stephen Patrick (COL ’13) said of the congregation.
At the temple, Patrick also attends Institute, a set of religious classes on an array of subjects all geared toward developing personal faith.
Both Brown and Patrick were encouraged to sustain that faith within their first week on campus, when another Mormon student reached out to them to welcome them to the Latter Day Saints community here.
“[The community is] a very tight-knit group and a family away from home,” Brown said, citing the group Scripture study she and the other students hold with their chaplain. Weekly dinners on Sundays also add to the welcoming atmosphere.
“Georgetown has been really supportive — we have a great relationship with the school,” Patrick said.
A COMMITMENT TO FAITH
Students who must commute to church come to know intimately the buildings and communities where they worship.
“[Inside St. Nicholas’] nearly every square inch of wall is painted with images of saints,” Pils said, describing the space that he has come to find so familiar.
From his seat in the choir, he recognizes the familiar faces of fellow Georgetown students and faculty in the congregation. But for Plis, getting out of his Georgetown comfort zone is the greatest draw to St. Nicholas’.
“Being connected to an off-campus worship space has put me in touch with people I otherwise would not connect with,” he said.
After liturgy Plis oftens meets with student parishioners from nearby American University for a weekly breakfast.
He is also working with other Orthodox Christians to increase their presence at Georgetown.
“More recently, some fellow students and I have held talks to see if once a month we can have Divine Liturgy on campus,” he said.
But even as he looks to boost the accessibility of services on campus, Plis said trekking off campus to pray is worth the time commitment.
“You have to make the concerted effort because it is just far away enough to be convenient not to go to Mass,” Plis says. “I am pretty content with what I have, even if I have to work harder for it.”

Attracting President Obama and prominent locals, the premier Georgetown restaurant 1789 has become a District hotspot for upscale dining. But neighbors weren’t always the eatery’s biggest fans. In the buildup to its establishment nearly 50 years ago, management went head to head with community leaders wary of a new eatery in an otherwise tranquil residential neighborhood.
TUMULTUOUS BEGINNINGS
In 1960, Richard “Dick” McCooey (C ’52) began purchasing the buildings that would later house 1789, The Tombs and F. Scott’s.
McCooey envisioned an establishment at 36th and Prospect Streets that would capture the Georgetown spirit.
“Dick McCooey wanted to provide for the university what Mory’s provided for Yale: alternative dining plus a reputable watering hole,” said Fr. R. Emmett Curran, S.J., a prominent university historian and professor emeritus of history.
But before he could open up shop, McCooey was caught up in a battle for the establishments’ liquor licenses. A group of Georgetown residents signed a petition objecting to the venture on the grounds that it would “alter the residential character of the neighborhood.”
Anonymous anti-1789 letters were sent to neighbors, according to an article titled “ABC Hears Final Debates; 1789 Decision Anticipated,” published in The Hoya on Dec. 7, 1961.
Opponents argued that the restaurant’s location was too close to Holy Trinity School, adding that the university would profit from its alcohol sales. Residents feared that the restaurant would foster a drunken atmosphere, diminishing the character of the high-end neighborhood.
McCooey’s attorney called the protesters’ efforts “a campaign of almost military precision, unparalleled in [his] 25 years of legal experience,” according to the Dec. 7 article.
Concerned neighbors launched a two-pronged effort to halt 1789’s progress. After attempting to prevent McCooey from obtaining liquor licenses, the neighbors turned to the Progressive Citizens Association of Georgetown and petitioned to revoke the remodeling permit McCooey had already been granted.
“There was a great deal of apprehension about and resistance to the university’s expansion into the neighborhood in the early 1960s,” Curran said. “Neighbors began referring to ‘imperial Georgetown.'”
According to The Hoya’s article “1789 Sets Construction With Zoning Board’s OK,” published Oct. 26, 1961, neighbors contested the construction project, arguing that it would not adhere to zoning restrictions and that it lacked adequate parking space.
According to Curran, local residents appealed to powers beyond the local government and alcohol board.
“One resident wrote to the Archbishop of Washington: ‘The clock on Healy Hall strikes … pealing forth over our neighborhood the ominous suggestion that our days as a residential community are numbered and soon … Georgetown University will extend all the way to Rock Creek,'” Curran said.
Eventually, McCooey secured Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration’s approval, finally launching his businesses in early 1962 and establishing what is now widely regarded as the culinary cornerstone of the high-end neighborhood.
THE EARLY YEARS
Once established, 1789 quickly won over neighbors.
“The restaurant was a success from the beginning,” Curran said.
Fr. William McFadden, S.J., a theology professor who came to Georgetown in 1963, recalled meeting at the restaurant for a lunch interview when it was first opened.
“It was not yet a fine French restaurant, [but] it was a wonderful addition to the area as a place to meet,” McFadden said. “It was the only place in town [and] a lot of people thought it was great to have somewhere that students [could] go for a night out that was close to campus and safer.”
By the 1970s, the restaurant began building its brand by attracting high-profile chefs. At the time, Alain Taulere, a member of French culinary arts academy Chaine des Rotisseurs, oversaw the restaurant as its chief saucier. He went on to own a ski resort in the French Pyrenees, according to an article titled “Dali’s Half a Loaf” published in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune on Oct. 26, 1975.
Such talent and recognition drew the D.C. elite’s business, but not without controversy.
Then-Speaker of the House Thomas “Tip” O’Neill (D-Mass.) allegedly misappropriated his funds for lavish dinners there in the mid-1970s, according to McFadden.
In the ’80s, McCooey sold 1789 to Clyde’s Restaurant Group, and the recognition of 1789 as a top destination continued to grow.
BUILDING A NEIGHBORHOOD FOLLOWING
Despite neighborhood concerns voiced at 1789’s founding, the restaurant did not foster the rowdy behavior many residents feared.
According to current general manager Dan Harding, the restaurant’s management has received only one noise complaint over the past year.
“The community trusts us,” he said.
Longtime 1789 employee Molly Quigley, who has worked for Clyde’s Restaurant Group since she began as a waitress at The Tombs in 1998, pointed out that the neighborhood did not realize the potential benefits of the establishment at the time.
“You can see why [opening a restaurant with a liquor license] would be an issue, [but] any controversy that existed was quickly forgotten,” Quigley said. “The community craved [1789] without knowing it. They didn’t realize what they lacked.”
The upscale eatery’s neighbors affirmed Quigley’s theory.
“I think it’s an incredible mainstay for fine dining,” Executive Director of Georgetown Business Improvement District James Bracco said. “It has always been a favorite place for me and my wife.”
Jennifer Altemus (COL ’88), president of the Citizens Association of Georgetown and a vocal opponent of the university’s campus expansion, praised the restaurant.
“We all love it,” Altemus said. “I had my wedding reception there. It’s a real gem.”
Altemus said 1789’s efforts to cooperate with surrounding residents have contributed to its success.
“They’re very, very good neighbors. They support our initiatives and fundraisers. They keep the place clean and keep the historic building well,” she said. “They’re very responsive, and if there’s a problem, they’re the first to jump and fix it.”
According to Quigley, 1789 acts as a helping hand to the neighborhood at large; for example, staff members often shovel for nearby residents during winter snowstorms.
“We are a neighbor,” Quigley said. “As management, we operate as homeowners.”
For Harding, despite past neighbors’ reservations, the 1789 complex has not diminished Georgetown’s residential charm.
“It’s cool to live around the block from 1789,” he said. “People who live around us are proud to have us here.”

PolicyMic.com, a fast-growing online forum for political discussion, debuted its weeklong “Hoya Challenge” Monday in order to find the best commentators on the Hilltop.
Students compete by ranking comments posted by their peers based on how interesting and compelling those comments are. Users who approve of a comment because they think it is thoughtful and well supported by facts can “mic” it.
The site aims to foster a nonpartisan, thoughtful debate among young people on current political issues.
“Young people can be very engaged in politics, but they need to be given the right place,” said Jake Horowitz, co-founder of PolicyMic.com.
Horowitz hopes the campus competition will increase PolicyMic’s exposure. Since its inception about one year ago, the site has expanded its membership to 48 states and 68 countries.
“The aim is to really start a conversation on Georgetown’s campus, and, if we do well at Georgetown, to move to the next campus and the next campus after that to really get college students engaged with the site,” Horowitz said.
The three students who have accumulated the most mics by Nov. 1 will receive prizes.
“We wanted to get as many Georgetown students as we could signed up and debating the issues that they care about,” Horowitz said.
The available prizes include lunch with CNN contributor and former Special Assistant to President George W. Bush David Frum, two tickets for the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center and a $50 gift certificate to Uncommon Grounds.
The first debate, led by Georgetown University Student Association President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12), opened at 3 p.m. Monday. Students contributed their opinions on noise regulations and safety initiatives being worked out with Georgetown’s neighboring community.
Students, faculty and PolicyMic editors will also lead debates throughout the week on issues including Ann Coulter’s controversial appearance on campus last week, the debt crises, unemployment and the university’s impact on the environment.
“[Georgetown students] are really active [and] politically engaged, and they want to have these kinds of conversations and represent our generation well,” Horowitz said.
Horowitz founded PolicyMic in June 2011 with the belief that the political dialogue in the mainstream media had become partisan and sterile.
“There was not enough debate happening in the nation, and there was no site where left, right and everybody in between were talking to one another,” he explained. “The news was too partisan and off-putting to young people.”
Paige Lovejoy (SFS ’12) began a PolicyMic discussion Monday night focusing on the investment of $1.25 million of the Student Activities Fee Endowment in social innovation. Lovejoy posted the topic in hopes that the proposal can become a reality, although she acknowledged that the online comments may not always be constructive.
“I’m sure on the discussion-board forum there will be people who post stupid comments that aren’t worth much, and I’m sure there will be others who contribute really valuable insights,” she said. “I’m hoping if the right people get involved, this website can be a credible source on campus for people to express their beliefs.”

The Department of Public Safety did not report a robbery at gunpoint that took place five blocks from campus last month to the campus community.
On Sept. 25 at about 1:22 a.m., the suspect approached the two 22-year-old men while they were walking on N Street, pointed a gun at them and demanded they hand over their wallets and phones. Both men, who were not Georgetown students, complied.
The suspect then instructed them to lie on the ground and wait 30 seconds before moving. By the time the pair had counted to 30, the suspect had fled in an unknown direction.
The suspect was described as a Hispanic male in his 20s, approximately 5-foot-9 or 5-foot-10 with a slender build. He was armed with a black handgun.
According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, the campus did not receive a PSA about the incident because DPS felt that it did not pose a threat to the campus community.
The Department of Public Safety website states that public safety alerts are issued when an incident is reported to DPS or the Metropolitan Police Department that the university feels poses a serious danger or continuing threat to the campus community.
In the past, PSAs have included burglaries, thefts and threatened assaults both on and off campus.
On March 29, The Hoya reported that DPS had sent out a PSA regarding a man who was robbed at gunpoint and physically assaulted in Burleith. The victim had no affiliation with the university, though he was treated for minor injuries at the Georgetown University Hospital.
In a similar incident on April 17, DPS alerted the campus that a woman who was not a member of the Georgetown community was robbed at knifepoint while walking on 35th Street.
But according to Pugh, the September robbery did not qualify as a threat to students, faculty or staff.
“Crimes that occur off campus and are not considered a threat to the safety of the university community do not warrant a campus PSA,” she wrote in an email.
Some students said that they thought they should have been alerted about the incident.
“I think it’s definitely a mistake not to send an email, because I think students have a right to know what’s happening near campus with public safety, especially with something that serious,” MaryToscano (COL ’14) said.
Leo Garzon (GRD ’13) added that he thought DPS should establish clearer guidelines regarding PSAs.
“I don’t feel this situation was necessarily handled poorly, but they need clear rules to decide when [PSAs] get sent out,” he said.
Representatives of the Department of Public Safety did not respond to requests for comment.

A new breed of singing groups with unique cultural focuses are lending their voices to highlight the Hilltop’s cultural diversity.
Chutzpah, an a cappella group comprised of Jewish students, takes its name from the Yiddish word for self-confidence or nerve. Founded in 2009, the group has performed in various concerts around the United States.
“Last year, we went to Kol HaOlam, which was the first national collegiate Jewish a cappella competition,” Laura Narefsky (COL ’14), a member of Chutzpah, said. “There were groups from all over the country in a big synagogue downtown, which was a blast.”
Though the group focuses primarily on its artistry, it also places great importance on its Jewish identity. Deborah Reichmann, the program coordinator for the Jewish Chaplaincy, believes the group helps capture the spirit of Judaism on campus.
“Music has been a major part of Jewish custom for many years, so when the students said, ‘We want to do this,’ we, the chaplaincy, were very happy to help,” she said.
Narefsky agreed that a sense of culture and faith underlies the group’s principles.
“The Jewish identity is pretty important, and it’s the basis of a lot of the songs, but more than anything, it’s a unifying force for all of the members,” she said.
Reichmann stressed that the group’s grassroots beginning showcases the ensemble’s heart and enthusiasm.
“The students conceived of it themselves,” she said. “They had the will and the perseverance and it was an organic movement.”
While Chutzpah often performs in Jewish communities, it also holds joint events with Harmony, another small a cappella group on campus. Like Chutzpah, Harmony, an all-female a cappella group, also features a strong cultural identity. The group was founded in 2000 and considers itself the only international a cappella group at Georgetown.
Harmony’s global flair is what originally drew Business Manager Farah Abdallah (COL ’14) to the group.
“I was interested in joining because it was international, which I thought was the coolest thing,” she said.
Harmony promotes cultural diversity by covering musical styles from around the world.
“That was sort of a niche that there wasn’t an a cappella group to fill,” said Katrina Braun (COL ’12), the group’s musical director and former deputy city news editor for The Hoya.
The group, which performs between five and 10 times per semester, has received numerous external invitations, including one from the French Embassy.
The group is small but enthusiastic, and fosters a spirit in which Abdallah hopes that other students will share.
“I encourage people to join these cultural groups because we’re always looking for diversity,” she said.
Resonant Essence Live is also rooted in strong cultural ties as Georgetown’s only black a cappella group. Founded in 2007, Resonant Essence Live aims to promote African-American culture on campus.
The ensemble also shares an unofficial connection with the Black Student Alliance, according to Jarvis Matthews (COL ’12), a singer in the group. Members can be found serving on the BSA’s leadership board, and the BSA encourages the ensemble to perform at many of its events.
“Our musical selections are primarily taken from the Gospel, R&B, Soul and Jazz genres,”  Matthews said.
The group, which currently has 11 members, performs regularly at the BSA’s Annual Kwanzaa Unity Dinner and Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program Weekend activities. They have also sung at Union Station in an event sponsored by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for Black History Month.
“We desire for our performances to move the audience in such a way that our joy and love of music resonates with the listeners,” Matthews said.

For a dozen students volunteering at the World War II memorial Saturday morning, raking leaves meant more than cleaning up a national monument — it was about honoring history.
The group was led by the Georgetown University Student Veterans Association, an organization that seeks to support veterans during their time on campus. Many members said that GUSVA’s service projects provide an opportunity for veterans to continue serving their country and practicing the military ethos.
“Being a part of the veterans program allows me to continue my service,” Theresa Hildson (SCS ’13) said. “It’s always great to be a part of something bigger than yourself. That is what I enjoyed about being in the Navy.”
For others, the project was an opportunity to show their support.
“We are out here cleaning up the area around the WWII memorial, and we are doing that to show our respect to WWII veterans,” Mark Miller (SCS ’12) said.
GUSVA President Colby Howard (SFS ’12) emphasized the importance of such community service to his organization’s mission.
“There is a role for community service, to act as an ambassador for the university and also to create productive dialogue between the university faculty, staff and also the student body for the betterment of student veterans at Georgetown,” Howard said.
GUSVA, which was founded in 2009 to advocate for veterans on campus, succeeded last spring in getting the School of Continuing Studies to fund a full-time position for a veterans’ affairs coordinator. Although there are no official counts of the number of veterans on campus, 271 students received veterans’ benefits last year.
One of the core goals of the group is to bring together all types of people to support veterans. The volunteer group included Georgetown students with various ties to the military, including ROTC and active duty members, veterans and students who have veterans in their families. Many nonmilitary students also turned out for the event to represent and advocate for other student groups.
“I’m here supporting GUSVA and veterans of WWII, trying to make the Mall a nicer place,” NooraMahmassani (COL ’15) said.
According to Brent Robbins, a maintenance worker with the National Park Service, the NPS is understaffed and depends on volunteers to help with the WWII memorial’s upkeep.
“For every 10 workers we need to maintain the memorial, we have two,” he said.
GUSVA’s members volunteered for about four hours Saturday morning tending to plants and cleaning the grounds around the World War II memorial.
Some veterans said they were particularly moved to see students with no military background eager to support the group’s efforts.
“There were a lot of veterans here who were actually emotional to see that there were students who weren’t in the military that cared,” said Nicole Heydt (COL ’13), director of community outreach forGUSVA.

T
he Georgetown University Student Association senate voted Sunday to fund student attendance of academic conferences with student fee money.
The initiative originally proposed by the GUSA executive would have earmarked $2,500 out of theGUSA Fund — a council created by the senate two years ago to supplement the money student groups receive from their funding boards — for the purpose.
In the final bill, the senate voted to allocate a combined $12,500 to the GUSA Fund including up to $2,500 for students requesting funds under the ambassador program. However, the final bill also permits the fund to allot the money to other student groups if they vote to do so.
As part of their campaign platform last year, President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Vice President GregLaverriere (COL ’12) proposed an ambassador program that would provide funds to help defray costs for students who want to attend conferences.
While the pair originally planned for the initiative to allocate $5,000, they decided to scale back their request to $2,500 for its first year. The bill proposed would also have allocated an additional $10,000 to be used expressly for student organizations.
However, many senators voiced concerns about whether the GUSA Fund was the correct outlet for such funding.
“Does it benefit students more broadly?” asked Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), chairman of GUSA’sFinance and Appropriations Committee, to open the debate.
Some senators noted that the GUSA Fund received several requests from students seeking funds to attend academic conferences last year, suggesting that there is a need for such an appropriation.
Senator Daniel LaMagna (COL ’13), said that he thought there was value in encouraging students to venture off campus for academic events.
“I think sometimes we’re too insular at Georgetown,” he said.
The program would require participating students to be sponsored by a professor or academic department. Upon their return, participants would share what they learned at the conference through a presentation and a brief that would then be posted on the GUSA website.
The senate also voted to amend the GUSA Fund charter to require that all of the fund’s allocations be approved by the entire senate. Senators said they hoped this would ensure more oversight for the program.
