The Metropolitan Police Department Hate Crimes Task Force Unit and the Department of Public Safety are investigating a bias-related incident after racial, anti-semitic and anti-religious graffiti were found in the men’s bathroom of the New Research Center on Tuesday.
A Georgetown Medical Center staffer reported the epithets at 10:55 a.m. to DPS, according to the Public Safety Alert sent out to the campus community.
DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith said that it appears to be an isolated incident and a thorough investigation is ongoing.
“We have zero tolerance for these kinds of issues,” he said.
