With a new administration set to enter the White House in January, the United States must rebuild its tainted global image, three former U.S. foreign policy leaders said during a virtual panel Tuesday. 
The panel, which included former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, retired four-star general George Casey and ex-CIA director George Tenet, expressed concern over the United States’ diminished international reputation and its consequences for future foreign policy. As the panelists discussed the country’s tarnished image, the Trump campaign continued its tenuous legal battle to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, an effort experts warn will further undermine the country’s democratic image and institutions. 
In only the past year, the country’s reputation has slipped to new lows, according to Albright. 
“I think that things have gotten harder for the United States in the last year. Our reputation has sunk lower. The last meeting that I went to, a real one, was in Europe at the Munich Security Conference in March. We were kind of a joke, even then,” Albright said. 
President Donald Trump first announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord in 2017, but the withdrawal became official this November. Countries criticized the United States for backing out, and the reputation of the United States has continued to drop around the world, particularly in light of the botched response to COVID-19. Health experts blasted Trump this summer for withdrawing from the World Health Organization amid a health crisis, another in a long list of missteps the panel said has hurt the United States’ reputation.
The world is watching to see what direction the United States is heading, according to Albright. 
“But I think it’s been a very hard year in terms of how the United States has been regarded, and I think that in many ways we have gotten deeper into kind of a sense of where is the United States, what is the role of the United States and how are we going to behave now,” Albright said.
Casey warned that in the past four years, the United States has fallen behind the rest of the world. 
“For me, it’s more than just the last year. It’s really the past four years. And as I think about President-elect Biden left the office, it was four years ago, and even more has happened in those four years than has happened in the last year. And we kind of turned inward, and I think the world moved on.” Casey said. 
Casey noted that the Biden administration will also have to address a host of complex security issues, including the ascendancy of Russia and China, Iran and North Korea’s growing nuclear capabilities and a revived terrorist threat to the United States and its allies. 
“We’re even more divided politically than we were four years ago, and we’re dealing with a pandemic that’s affecting us personally and economically, and the administration really has its work cut out for them,” Casey said. “I think the road back to global leadership for the United States is going to take a long time if it happens at all.” 
The three panelists agreed that the path for the United States to regain its global credibility is leading the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“I do think that one really does have to do COVID first in all its aspects because it’s a virus that knows no borders,” Albright said. “It means dealing with things in the United States, but then also reestablishing ourselves in terms of trying to help those countries where it hasn’t hit yet, and how do we work with the World Health Organization.” 
The Trump administration received strong criticism from foreign policy experts for gutting government departments of their career civil servants and undermining the work of foreign policy workers with political intrigue. To effectively reestablish U.S. primacy on the global stage, the Biden administration must also reverse the internal damage done by the Trump administration to the country’s foreign policy apparatus, according to Albright.  
“There’s going to have to be some kind of a way that the various departments that are involved in national security have to be revived and have to get their reputations back and have to be populated by people who actually know what they are doing,” Albright said. “That part is going to be very important, and I now believe more and more that the issues that are out there require more departments to be involved in them, kind of whole of government approach.”

Graduate student organizations allege Georgetown University did not adequately address the needs of graduate students and graduate student workers in its newly released plan for the spring 2021 semester.
Georgetown University Graduate Student Government and the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees have raised concerns that the policies for undergraduate students have been more generous and more clearly articulated than the plans for graduate students, after the university released spring plans Nov. 16.
Members of GradGov specifically raised concerns over discrepancies in the tuition discounts for undergraduates and graduate students and unequal access to campus spaces. Both graduate and undergraduate students will continue to receive the same tuition discounts from the fall semester, but undergraduate students not living on campus received a 10% discount, while graduate students only received a 5% discount. Some graduate students also worry they will have fewer campus spaces exclusively apportioned for them.
The discrepancies between discounts fit into a pattern of the university disregarding graduate students, according to Henry Watson (GRD ’23), president of GradGov.
“GradGov finds it unacceptable, but not surprising, that Georgetown is continuing to implement an inequitable tuition discount,” Watson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This inequity reaffirms the university’s tradition of disregarding graduate students, and is layered on top of the lack of graduate student aid from the CARES Act last Spring and an inequitable tuition discount this past Fall. GradGov will continue to fight on the tuition issue moving forwards.”
GradGov held a town hall meeting Nov. 20 with several deans of graduate schools and programs to discuss concerns about the spring plans after they were released, with many graduate students asserting that the administration consistently privileges undergraduates in their policymaking.
In response, several deans affirmed they had advocated for an equitable tuition discount, but both the Office of the Provost and the Board of Trustees rejected the proposal. The deans related that the administration had made up its mind regarding tuition and that graduate students should not expect a 10% discount.
Several deans reported other steps being taken to help graduate students, including the implementation of an $100,000 fund to help struggling graduate students. Details regarding who would qualify and how the funds would be distributed have not been finalized, however, according to the deans.
Any discrepancies between undergraduate and graduate policies fall out of the disparate circumstances facing the two groups, according to a university spokesperson.
“The tuition reduction for undergraduate students not invited back to campus is in recognition that they will not have access to certain undergraduate-focused facilities and services on campus,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “University administrators have met regularly with graduate student leaders over the last semester and intend to continue these discussions. As demonstrated in a variety of ways, we are committed to protecting and supporting graduate students.”
Revived concerns over the tuition discount come after GradGov submitted a petition Sept. 16 to university administrators calling for a 10% tuition discount for graduate students in the spring semester. Additionally, GradGov submitted a set of questions to university administrators complaining about unequal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act disbursements. 
GradGov raised the petition and questions after noticing discrepancies in the university’s disbursements of CARES Act funding, a COVID-19 relief bill that included relief funds for universities and colleges. The federal government calculates CARES Act funding according to the number of students enrolled at a school, and it factors in how many are Pell grant recipients. While graduate students accounted for nearly 40% of contributions to the amount Georgetown received from the act, only 8% of student grants went to graduate students, according to Watson.
The university ultimately rejected GradGov’s petition and did not respond formally to GradGov’s questions by the time it had released spring reopening plans.
The GradGov Senate voted Oct. 30 to approve a spring 2021 statement of principles, outlining GradGov’s official stance on reopening policies. The statement primarily addressed concerns on the topics of campus density, communication, academics, financial support and student safety.
The statement specifically called for equitable tuition discounts, increased financial support for graduate student workers, increased accommodations for students in different time zones, continuation of current grading policies and the establishment of a standard of practice for all professors and faculty. 
Separate from GradGov, graduate student workers and members of GAGE raised concerns about the current lack of clear policies regarding graduate student workers.
Though administrators stated in the Nov. 16 faculty senate meeting in which spring reopening policies were announced that all graduate student workers who were teaching hybrid classes would not be required to teach in person, no formal policy has been presented in writing.
Despite confusion over what the ultimate policy will entail, GAGE remains committed to advocating for graduate student worker protections, according to Ellen Jacobs (GRD ’24), chair of the GAGE communications committee.
“Graduate workers have not received a clear message or contractual guarantee that they will have a choice in whether they teach in-person,” Jacobs wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We await finalized plans from the administration and will offer feedback on behalf of graduate workers about these proposed plans and their impacts on graduate work at Georgetown.”
The university said it will not force graduate workers or researchers to work on campus and will work to provide alternatives for those who choose not to do so, according to a university spokesperson.
“The graduate worker policies for Spring have been updated after consultation with graduate school student leaders and with GAGE,” the university spokesperson wrote. “This Spring, we will continue the policy that provides flexibility so that no graduate student will be compelled or pressured to teach on campus. We are also committed to trying to find alternative assignments for Research Assistants whose research work depends on being face-to-face, but who do not wish to return to campus.”
This article was updated Nov. 20 to include the expected graduation of Ellen Jacobs, chair of the GAGE communications committee.

Many Georgetown University faculty members are frustrated about a lack of transparency from administrators surrounding the university’s COVID-19 response planning, according to a recent survey of hundreds of university faculty. 
The survey, conducted by a group of seven professors who call themselves Scholars for Scholars, highlighted a number of other faculty concerns about the university’s planning for the fall semester. More than three-quarters of faculty surveyed want the university to restructure the budget and use its assets — including the endowment — to protect faculty and staff wages. The survey also found that the majority of faculty would not feel comfortable returning to campus unless they had access to an effective vaccine. 
S4S circulated the survey among faculty members in mid-October, receiving 344 responses. The group’s founders felt the university administration was overlooking faculty feedback and interests when piecing together its COVID-19 response, according to Shareen Joshi, an economics professor and one of S4S’s founding members. 
“Many faculty at Georgetown have expertise on issues directly related to the pandemic,” Joshi wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Many of them have been surprisingly absent in the planning processes.”
The survey results, which were sent to faculty Oct. 27, found that 46% of faculty did not feel included in university decision-making surrounding pandemic policy. At least 80% of faculty agreed they wanted to see greater transparency regarding financial planning during the pandemic.
University administrators decided to shift to online learning in March, as COVID-19 began to spread across the United States. The hasty transition necessitated substantial changes in university finances, academic practices and daily routines. 
The university said faculty were included in deciding these changes. In response to the survey results, a spokesperson for the university identified committees in which administrators had collaborated with faculty and expressed a commitment to continue involving faculty in the decision-making process.
“We are grateful to our faculty who are serving on the many advisory groups some of which were formed to inform the University’s decisions during the pandemic,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Jacques Berlinerblau, a professor in the department of Jewish civilization and another S4S leader, said faculty have still been largely left out of decision-making, and many of the obstacles that have arisen in the past semester because of the pandemic could have been avoided by seeking greater faculty input.
“Something has gone wrong. A lot of our deliberative processes have gone wrong,” Berlinerblau said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is a nationwide phenomenon limited not only to Georgetown. I’m the 1,000th person to say this, but by constantly making this a top-down deliberative process, a lot of good options weren’t being considered.”
Though most faculty said they effectively adjusted to online teaching this fall, a majority of the faculty feel as if the university is further limiting their ability to carry out their research, the survey found. 
At least 80% of faculty surveyed were worried about restrictions on research, with the top two concerns being university limits on the use of research funds and access to facilities. The university limited access to university research facilities and cut funding for research initiatives to minimize community spread and make up for budget shortfalls. 
Joshi said the administration did not adequately prepare for how the restriction of resources would hurt faculty research and did not account for diverse faculty needs.
“Policies were often made quickly without talking to us. We’re a heterogeneous faculty. It was quite stressful to constantly discuss how to get us back in the classroom. We needed to also talk about the impact of the pandemic on our scholarship and research,” Joshi said. “It’s not just students who value on-campus instruction; for some, it’s the library, Healy Hall, labs, access to the servers, or collaboration with our peers. Many of us were eager to have a substantive conversation on the short-term and long-term plan for these activities.”
The university announced Monday that it plans to invite 500 seniors back to campus and host some hybrid courses during the spring semester. S4S leaders said faculty were not widely consulted to help formulate the school’s spring plan, and university transparency is still lacking, according to Joshi. 
“We were not formally consulted in any way,” Joshi wrote in a follow-up email. “We had hoped that the decision-making process would be more transparent than it was.”
While S4S leaders appreciate the university’s offering faculty the ability to return, faculty will not be able to make appropriate work decisions without a more complete understanding of how the pandemic will develop. 
“We appreciate that the university is trying to give faculty the choice to make their own decisions. But we also feel that this should be a broad public health decision,” Joshi wrote. “An individual professor cannot make a fully informed decision without a deeper understanding of the relevant public health conditions and the effectiveness of these new methods of learning.” 
S4S, Joshi added, plans to meet with administrators and continue collecting faculty feedback to encourage greater university transparency and faculty inclusion. 
“Going forward, we really need to be better informed about the deliberations of various committees that are working on pandemic-related issues. We also continue to be concerned about faculty voices,” Joshi wrote. “We truly believe that we can offer a better and safer learning environment to our students if we can ensure that many more of our voices are heard.”

To the author, William Kim:  Thank you for your article.  As a faculty member who takes issue with key aspects of this survey, however, I would be glad to know your response to three questions.
1. The article says:  “The survey results, which were sent to faculty Oct. 27, found that 46% of faculty did not feel included in university decision-making surrounding pandemic policy.”  Does this not indicate that 54% of the faculty do feel included?  
2.  Some members of this self-appointed group decided to remain anonymous.  Did you ask your interviewees why the group made this decision?
3.  Did you do any fact-checking on how many ways faculty were invited to contribute to the various policies and on how many ways the administration took faculty concerns and needs into account?
Perhaps you could write a follow-up article on these points.
Respectfully,
M. McMorrow (Faculty, Government Dept)

The Georgetown University Student Association unanimously voted to create a student advisory committee that will oversee the Georgetown University Police Department at a meeting Nov. 8. 
The committee will serve as a watchdog body tasked with holding GUPD accountable for any misconduct, according to the legislation. 
The bill seeks to address long-standing concerns about the prevalence of racial profiling and police brutality among GUPD officers, according to GUSA Senate Speaker Leo Teixeira (COL ’21), who introduced the bill. While few formal bias reports have been filed against GUPD, many BIPOC Georgetown students in the past year have shared instances of hyperpolicing from GUPD in solidarity groups and on social media, including experiences of unnecessary surveillance and excessive use of force by the department.
The senate originally passed a resolution calling for an oversight committee in June in response to the police murder of George Floyd. The most recent bill, however, revises the structure of the committee and incorporates suggestions from Georgetown United Against Police Aggression, a student organization that seeks to prevent concerning police practices. 
The committee will be tasked with maintaining and publicizing an anonymous reporting form that students will be able to use to make an informal bias or misconduct complaint against a GUPD officer, according to Teixeira. 
“They are going to be serving as a [GUSA] body,” Teixeira said during the GUSA meeting. “We know that that process is pretty arduous, and people were turned off by that process,” he said of the current bias reporting system. 
Despite many complaints of GUPD bias, very few official bias reports have been filed through GUPD in recent years. Students have said the system is tedious and fear their concerns will not be listened to. 
The group will also publish semesterly reports documenting complaints and policing incidents separate from the reporting form, and it will issue recommendations for GUPD in regards to training, policies and protocols to be looked over by administration officials. 
A representative from GUAPA will chair the eight-person committee, which will include representatives from the Black Leadership Forum, the Latinx Leadership Forum, the Asian-Pacific Islander Leadership Forum and the GUSA Senate.
“We wanted to make this a body that is made up of the people most impacted by the problem and therefore have the biggest stake in making sure the problem is changed,” Teixeira said of the committee.
GUAPA did not respond to a request for comment. 
The university has been fielding student concerns and feedback about campus policing, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Georgetown’s Police Department is committed to engaging with the campus community, listening to feedback, and incorporating suggestions,” a spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The spokesperson also encouraged students to participate in the Student Safety Advisory Board, a group that meets biweekly with GUPD chief Jay Gruber to discuss campus policing. 
Senators Camber Vincent (SFS ’24) and Dominic Gordon (SFS ’24) questioned the bill’s ability to influence Georgetown administrators to enact reforms within GUPD.
“Do you think they will listen to us when they say their data is not accurate?” Gordon questioned during the meeting. “Is there a way we can get the university to trust our own reports?”
In response to doubts about the oversight committee’s potential effectiveness, Teixiera suggested that students had to take matters into their own hands, given what he said is the university’s poor track record on implementing student feedback. 
“As we all know at this point, the university is rarely, if ever, in the business of listening to student interests,” Teixiera said. “Just because we assume they aren’t going to be on board doesn’t mean we don’t do anything about it.”

Many on-campus Georgetown University students have had to resort to photo editing and negotiations with health screeners to enter campus buildings after identifying glitches with the university’s digital building access badge. 
On-campus students are required to be tested twice a week and report their symptoms daily through an app developed by One Medical, a primary care provider, according to the university’s official COVID-19 guidelines. Students who report low-risk symptoms, complete their tests and test negative for COVID-19 are supposed to receive a green badge on the app. 
The green badge permits students to access certain campus common spaces, such as Lauinger Library and Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall. Students who fail to meet qualifications receive a red badge, which indicates high infection risk and limits student access, and have limited access to campus common spaces. 
Students must present their badge to public health screeners — security workers contracted by the university — stationed outside certain campus buildings. Faculty and staff approved to work on campus are also required to track their symptoms, receive tests and present a building access badge. 
Some students, however, have reported receiving red badges on the app despite reportedly meeting all of the requirements. In a group chat for on-campus residents, some students have said they have used screenshots of old green passes to get past checkpoints when they encounter glitches, using apps like Snapchat to photoshop the current date onto a screenshot of an old green badge. Students said some screeners only glance at the badges, not always taking the time to verify the dates on them. 
Despite these exceptions and workarounds, many students still struggle to access campus buildings because of the reported glitch. Bella Fasset (SFS ’24), a first-year student living on campus, said when she was turned away from Leo’s with a red badge, she was told by the public health screener to go to Royal Jacket instead, where there are no public health screeners checking badges. 
Fasset reported the glitch to One Medical, but it did not address her concerns. 
“There was one day when my badge was red for no apparent reason,” Fasset wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The person checking badges at Leo’s told me to call One Medical and so I did and they told me it wasn’t a problem on their end, which I told the worker, and they didn’t know where to direct me from there and so the issue didn’t get resolved for that day.”  
One Medical reports risk assessment data to the university but does not manage the badges that students use to access buildings on campus, according to a One Medical spokesperson.  
Other students, like Milan Perry (COL ’21), have experienced similar problems with faulty building badges.  
“I was trying to go to Leo’s and I opened my badge and it was red, even though I had done the COVID daily check-in on the One Medical app the day before,” Perry wrote in an email to The Hoya. “A week or two before, some people in our on-campus chat had problems with their badge suddenly turning red in the middle of the day, but this was the first time I’d noticed issues with my badge.” 
As a result of frequent technical difficulties with their badges, some students have had to spend money on takeout instead of the meal plan they already paid for, according to Cambria Coughlin (NHS ’22), who is also living on-campus.  
“I was unable to go to Leo’s to get food, so I had to have my roommate pick up takeout for me instead,” Coughlin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I was told we had to get a meal plan, so then to not be able to use it was frustrating, especially since I have been so careful about making sure I do the check-ins every day and getting COVID tested twice a week.” 
Despite widespread student complaints about badge glitches, Georgetown has not received any reports from students about issues with access badges, according to a university spokesperson. If students are experiencing troubles, they should email or call the university’s COVID-19 hotline, the spokesperson added. 
Perry expressed concern that if these issues arose on a day she had to work at Lau, she would lose the day’s wages. 
“That day I was only trying to go to Leo’s, so it wasn’t that big of a deal, though being able to access my meal plan is still important, but if a similar thing happens on a day I work then I’ll just be out of those wages.”
This article has been updated to clarify that One Medical is not responsible for student badges.

Omar Alshogre (GRD ’24) was driving through the mountains of Norway when he received an email notifying him he was accepted to Georgetown University just nine days after applying. Because he had never received an admission letter before, he had to Google what the letter was supposed to look like before believing the email. 
Stopping the car, a friend captured Alshogre’s elation in a video that has been viewed over 179,000 times on Twitter since it was posted Nov. 1. 
Alshogre’s acceptance to the university comes after harsh treatment from the Syrian regime headed by dictator Bashar al-Assad. When the Syrian Revolution began in 2011, Alshogre, then 15 years old, attended his first pro-democracy protest, where he was also arrested. 
Though he had gone to that first protest to prove himself to his father, a retired military officer, his subsequent imprisonment for two nights changed their relationship, Alshogre said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. 
“When I made it out of prison, I went to my father to tell him that I survived that. I am strong, right, look what they did to me and I still I survived,” Alshogre said. “At that time, my father changed. My father became a different person because he realized that we may die or he may die in this war.”
What began as a set of nationwide demonstrations for government reform quickly morphed into the vicious Syrian civil war that has claimed the lives of at least 400,000 people. Many dissidents and rebel fighters arrested or captured by the Assad regime have been detained in the government’s elaborate prison system, which is notorious for its poor conditions and the systemic torturing of detainees.
Although he still wanted to prove himself after experiencing prison, Alshogre said his activism quickly became about ending the brutal treatment Assad was subjecting his people to. 
“I just wanted to prove to my father I’m not a kid, but then, when they detained me for the first time then released me, I understood what freedom meant for the first time because they took all of that me,” Alshogre said. “So when I got out of prison, I demonstrated to be free.” 
When Alshogre was detained for the last time at 17, he spent three years between the Saydnaya Prison, known as the “human slaughterhouse,” and Branch 215, a political prison in Damascus, according to Alshogre. 
Weighing only 75 pounds, Alshogre was smuggled out from prison in 2015 for $20,000, a price his mother paid to a judge and a prison officer. The officer and judge staged a mock execution to sneak Alshogre out of the prison. 
Unaware of this deal, Alshogre was carried out of the Saydnaya prison blindfolded. Waking up alone and covered in blood, Alshogre saw sunlight for the first time in three years. Eventually, he would learn another prisoner had been executed in his place. 
He snuck away to Turkey to recover before seeking refuge in Sweden.
After completing high school in Sweden, Alshogre started to speak publicly about his story. Gaining an audience, Alshogre was offered a job with the Boston Consulting Group, a global consulting company, to speak across Sweden about trauma as a driving force of leadership. Through his various consulting projects, Alshogre was able to travel and share his story on his own time. 
Alshogre traveled to the United States for the first time in 2018 to speak at Brown University about his experiences. The same year, he became involved with the Syrian Emergency Task Force, an organization that supports Syrian citizens in their fight for democracy. 
With the SETF, where he currently serves as the director of detainee affairs, Alshogre has advocated for the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, a bill signed into law in 2019 that authorizes sanctions on the Syrian government for its human rights abuses. The bill is named for a Syrian photographer who shared images of torture perpetrated by the Assad regime.
In March, alongside other advocates for the Caesar Act, Alshogre testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations about the passage of this bill and his experiences while detained in Syria. Though it was intimidating to speak in front of the Senate, Alshogre felt like he had a responsibility to share his story.  
“I was afraid to be there but, as well, I said, ‘If I don’t do it, and everybody gets scared, and in the end the regime will win the war, and nobody will get what they want,’” Alshogre said. “If somebody will stand in front and be the face for that, it should be me because I am firstly a public speaker. So I have the way of telling the stories.” 
Since Alshogre’s Georgetown acceptance video surfaced, a surprising number of Georgetown students, faculty and graduates have reached out asking to meet him, according to Alshogre. 
“In Sweden, you don’t say hi to somebody you don’t know, and you don’t go in the elevator with somebody you don’t know,” Alshogre said. “And it’s not only American people, but people who have been studying at Georgetown are reaching out. That was amazing.” 
When Daniel Skaven Ruben (GRD ’16) saw Alshogre’s video, he reached out immediately. 
“Once you’re accepted into Georgetown, you also become part of this family and this community of people that are ready to help you,” Ruben said in a video interview with The Hoya. “The only thing that unites you is that you go to the same school, but that’s enough for someone to say, ‘I want to help you, you’re a fellow Hoya. Let’s see how I can be helpful.’” 
Alshogre decided to apply to Georgetown because he would be closer to policymakers and could combine his interests in business and international affairs with his ideas for a more just future in Syria. He will be pursuing a bachelor’s degree in the School of Continuing Studies, whose campus is located several blocks from the Capitol. 
“I believe I can be part of rebuilding Syria,” Alshogre said. “I have this idea in my head that I am tired of seeing politicians and human rights activists being the only parts working to solve the conflict and the war in the world. And we have a lot of brilliant minds, a lot of businesses, that bring a lot of smart people, but those smart people never had the chance to think of solving the conflicts in war zones.” 
This article was corrected Nov. 20 to correct details about Alshogre’s relationship with BCG, clarify details about his travels to the United States, and add information about the degree he is pursuing.
