The working groups charged with hammering out the four proposals slated to spend the $3.4 million Student Activities Fee Endowment fund are edging closer to completing their proposals, according to the groups.
At the end of last year, four working groups were tasked with creating a detailed plan for the two primary and two back-up proposals the SAFE Commission voted to endorse for use of the money.
One of the primary proposals, which aims to install solar panels on 43 university owned townhouses, is almost ready to implement.
Advocates recently met with representatives of the Office of Housing and Facilities and the university’s Sustainability Office to iron out the details of the initiative. The group also solicited proposals from local solar power firms with the aim of selecting a final candidate for the project later in the fall.
“It certainly seems like that proposal is going to become a reality, which we’re really excited about,” said Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), chairman of the Georgetown University Students Association’s Finance and Appropriations Committee, which is charged with overseeing the working groups.
The initiative could be put to a student referendum as early as the second week of November, allowing the group to begin preparations in time to install the panels at the beginning of summer if the proposal passes.
The initiative will save the university about $235,000 in electricity bills over 20 years by providing 20 to 25 percent of necessary electricity for townhouses where they are installed at cheaper rates, according to estimates by the working group. The group plans to return this money to students through a fund directed by GUSA.
“This is a pretty sure bet for students for 20 years,” working group head David Nulsen (SFS ’12) said.
If passed, the project would become the largest student-funded solar initiative in the world.
Despite disapproval voiced two weeks  ago by Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia concerning the Healy Pub proposal, which was selected as a primary proposal to receive the bulk of the fund’s $3.4 million, members of its working group said they have revised their plan and are preparing for a meeting with university officials.
“Though the administration has signaled in the past that they have serious concerns regarding the proposal, they have agreed to respect the process and hear a full presentation of the proposal on its merits,” members wrote in their latest update.
Malkerson said that group expects to meet with DeGioia within the next few weeks. While he remains hopeful about the upcoming meeting, Malkerson said that the administration’s opposition is a factor to consider for the working groups.
“It’s only responsible to think more seriously about other proposals,” he said.
The New South Student Center, a major renovation to the basement of New South, is one of the proposals that would receive funding if either of the primary proposals falls through. Administrators have cited the project — which is scheduled to open in the fall of 2014 — as a priority over the Healy Pub.
“The process will continue to play out, and if I get a chance to restate my case I’ll be excited to do so,” said NSSC working group head Taylor Price (MSB ’10), adding that students will benefit from whichever proposal is implemented.
While the NSSC will be completed regardless of whether it receives a portion of the endowment funds, proponents argued that additional funding would allow students to better shape the space to their needs. In his latest update, Price wrote that he has begun work on a list of specific ways that NSSC plans could be improved with the addition of SAFE funds.
“This is a proactive measure, but an important one to start working on now,” Price wrote.
The last of the four working groups, focused on the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, proposed ways that the fund could be managed, as well as partnerships with the Center for Social Justice, Hoya Challenge and the Office of Student Affairs to help allocate the money to a set number of projects each year.
Nick Troiano (COL ’11), leader of the SIPS working group, said that the group felt that the university community already had a framework to support social entrepreneurship.
“It’s just the funding that simply isn’t there to scale,” he said.
Working group members also began meetings with the Office of Advancement to help allay concerns that the university would be opposed to a student organization fundraising.
“We’ve had great progress on productive conversations with people in the Office of Advancement,” Troiano said. “We think that there’s going to be an appetite among alumni to give back in that way.”
He added that after some calculations, the working group has also realized that the fund could also be sustainable until 2031 without any further fundraising.
“It’s not make or break for us,” he said.

The recent addition of five Kindle e-readers to Lauinger Library may have campus bibliophiles buzzing over a new chapter in education, but not every volume listed on the syllabus may be available in Kindle format.
For the last two months, the devices have been available for student and faculty use through the Gelardin Media Center. The e-readers may be checked out for up to a month at a time, and just one day after announcing the new Kindles, the library had filled their rental slots through October.
There’s no guarantee students can optimize the rental for class use, however.
While the Kindle store offers nearly a million general interest titles for purchase, as well as monthly textbook rentals for as little as one dollar, its collection of college material is rather sparse. For example, only two of the 13 books required for one “Elements of Political Theory” course at Georgetown —which can be purchased new at the bookstore for about $200 — are available through Amazon.
At the start of this school year, Amazon only offered 18 of the top 100 college textbooks, according to CampusBooks.com. Even among those 18 textbooks, only five were available for the cheapest rental period.
“Academic books are trailing because there isn’t as much commercial value,” Beth Marhanka, department head of Gelardin explained. “It’s just like with movie rentals — feature films are available first, then you get to the documentaries with academic content.”
Lauinger has been expanding its collection of online e-books for years and now offers 10s of thousands of books electronically. Since the legality of loaning Kindle content has been a contentious subject, Lauinger’s Kindle borrowers must purchase e-books out of pocket.
The basic Kindle put out by Amazon.com, which retails for $114, is the top-selling e-book reader, selling millions of units since its 2007 release. The latest $379 Kindle DX, the version that Georgetown offers, can hold 3,500 books while offering tools such as highlighting, note-taking and a dictionary.
“I think what libraries need to be concerned with is the content, not the format,” Marhanka said. “It’s incredibly important for libraries to be on top of this huge change in information technology.”
Even as the number of course books available electronically has risen, recent trends show Georgetown students remain print devotees. According to Lauinger’s Stacks Services Coordinator Claire Corbett, the number of printed books being checked out has remained relatively constant over the last few years despite the rise of electronic alternatives.
“When we work with researchers, faculty and graduate students, they almost always prefer to use hard copies of books,” Corbett said. “It seems to only be some undergraduates who prefer electronic research.”
Corbett noted that she has encountered some library patrons in the past who were angry that a certain text was only available electronically.
“People like holding the book and turning the pages, and they also might want to highlight or take notes on the pages, and you can’t do that with something like Kindle,” she said.
While e-readers have encountered substantial scrutiny from those who find a distinct intimacy with reading print material, Marhanka likens the situation to what occurred during the transition to online research journals, which students now access almost entirely online.
And though the dawn of Kindle at Lauinger is generating buzz, Marhanka said the Amazon product may not be the answer for academics. Rather, she sees a growth opportunity for tablet devices like iPads moving forward.
“Kindle is really wonderful for reading novels, but if you’re getting into academic books, you need color and multimedia,” Marhanka said. “What I find really exciting is when, in an e-text, you can click on a picture and it becomes a video. When you have the content of a book and the capabilities of electronics, it’s the best of both worlds.”
In 2009, Amazon announced a pilot project that first introduced Kindles to college campuses. About 50 students at seven universities, including Case Western Reserve University and Princeton University, were given Kindles to use in their classes. iPads, which tend to be more popular among college students, have also become available for students at many colleges. The University of Maryland, Reed College and the University of Notre Dame all recently implemented programs that distributed iPads, according to a report by the Chronicle for Higher Education.

Allegations of corruption in Mayor Vincent Gray’s administration have led to major overhauls in his top staff.
Current Gray staffers are being accused of nepotism, overpaying top officials and using unethical tactics in the 2010 mayoral campaign.
Gray’s camp allegedly promised an administration position and gave cash payments to fringe mayoral candidate Sulaimon Brown, prompting him to stay in the race and use the media attention to criticize incumbent mayor Adrian Fenty.
Brown was also later given a position within the Gray administration at the D.C. Department of Health Care Finance with an annual salary of $110,000. After Brown was fired from this position in March, he met with officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation to discuss the allegations of scandal.
Though Gray adamantly denies all of Brown’s accusations, the FBI has said it is aware of Brown’s allegations and is in the process of evaluating them.
The mayor was also prompted to fire his first chief of staff, Gerri Mason Hall, in March amid allegations of nepotism surrounding the hiring of Hall’s son and the children of other campaign officials.
On Aug. 30, Gray announced the appointment of new chief of staff, Christopher Murphy, and deputy chief of staff, Angela Pringle.
Murphy comes to his new post after working as deputy chief of staff in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Pringle was formerly the deputy campaign manager for Howard Dean during his 2004 presidential run.
All of the top personnel changeovers have led to widespread concerns about the effectiveness of Gray’s administration.
“The allegations against Mayor Gray are serious, and if proven true are just cause for his resignation or removal from office: The buck must stop at the mayor’s desk,” Sam Dulik (SFS ’13), the director of communications for Georgetown University College Republicans, wrote in an email.
Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13), chair of the student advocacy group DC Students Speak, expressed concern but said he still had hope for the administration.
“Most students who are engaged with local politics can say they’ve been disappointed with some of the scandal that resulted from the Gray administration, specifically the scandal involving Sulaimon Brown and his appointment into the Gray administration, but there are a lot of positive things that Gray has done at the same time,” Stirrett said.
Jason Gerson (COL ’14), the director of off-campus outreach for Georgetown University College Democrats, said that his group remains supportive of the Gray administration.
“Other people make allegations, but we fully stand behind Mayor Gray, and we fully believe in his administration and the policies that he’s pursued so far,” he said.
Despite doubts about Gray’s effectiveness, Georgetown University attests that its relationship with the mayor’s office remains strong and productive.
“Georgetown University enjoys a good working relationship with Mayor Gray and his administration on quality of life issues, as they relate to the university, our students and our neighbors,” Associate Vice President for External Relations Linda Grennan wrote in an email. “We’ll continue to work with community leaders and officials to ensure a high quality of life, regardless of who holds these posts.”
The mayor’s office could not be reached for comment at press time.

As the community prepares to remember the violence of the Sept.11th terrorist attacks, students and faculty will close discussions in a conference designed to highlight recent successes and challenges in conflict resolution.
“Students in part will get this lesson: Peace is not something that comes easily. It is something that we have to work toward,” said Fathali Moghaddam, director of the Master of Arts in Conflict Resolution program.
“From Conflict to Peace: Innovative Approaches to Peacebuilding,” which was organized jointly by the Conflict Resolution program and the Office of the President, is the first conference of its kind at Georgetown. Moghaddam said it has been extremely successful, with several hundred people registered.
“Conflict resolution is so well-matched to the Georgetown institution,” he said.
The conference was designed to highlight successes in recent peace-building, such as South Africa and Northern Ireland. Challenges in the Middle East also dominated conference discussions.
“It’s a very important time for the Middle East,” Moghaddam said. “We see opportunities coming, but we also see great dangers.”
Moghaddam said he hoped the conference’s success would draw more attention to the Conflict Resolution Program that opened its doors six years ago and now has 75 graduate students enrolled.
“One of our goals is to bring more students into conflict resolution,” Moghaddam said, adding that he especially wanted to raise awareness of opportunities for undergraduate students.
Students who helped organize the conference said they are especially excited for today’s speaker panel, which will feature students from Georgetown and around the world. Among the topics are a discussion on sports and peace and one featuring students from Queen’s University in Belfast who will discuss the Irish peace process based on their own experiences.
“It’s going to be very exciting to hear the results of very recent research in all these areas,” Amanda Munroe (GRD ’12) said.
Kaitlyn Allen (GRD ’12), who also helped organize the conference, said that the panelists like Robi Damelin — a widely known advocate and member of Parents Circle, which is an organization for bereaved Palestinian and Israeli parents — were the highlight of the conference for her.
“We’ve all studied her work, in essence,” Allen said.
Damelin, whose son was shot by a sniper while serving in the Israeli Army, said she thought it was important to engage in dialogue with those from opposing sides of an issue.
“On the contrary, I’m happy to talk to people who disagree with me because I feel it’s important to plant a seed,” she said. “We don’t have a monopoly on truth.”

Hit sitcom star and comedian Donald Glover kept Hoyas laughing in Gaston Hall Wednesday night with his nostalgia-driven jokes and anecdotes.
Sponsored by the Georgetown Program Board, the event featured two student opening acts, HenryThaler (COL ’14) and Nehemiah Markos (COL ’14). The Georgetown comedians warmed up the crowd for the star of the show, Don Glover. Most know him for his role as college student Troy Barnes on NBC’s runaway hit comedy “Community,” his earlier work with the sketch group Derrick Comedy or under his rapper pseudonym Childish Gambino.
Andrew Marinelli (SFS ’12) called Glover’s role on “Community” “the lovable jock” who, alongside character Abed, “make[s] the show.” As well as brief writing stints with Tina Fey’s “30 Rock” and “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,” Glover also just finished a comedy tour around the United States and Canada.
Expectations were high among the massive student turnout, and Glover delivered, keeping his energy high and his stories rolling — even deflecting the setback of a dead microphone. By no means did the show keep to the family-friendly guidelines of a primetime sitcom, with Glover even remarking on the discrepancy between his standup and his work on “Community.”
Glover refused to shy away from potentially sensitive subject matter, railing on racism via his experience as a potential contender for the role of Peter Parker in the new “Spiderman” film and even on gender discrepancies in rape.
Despite the racy language and some controversial themes, Glover doled out the physical and energetic comedy Community-aficionados have come to know and love.
Besides describing modern-day pop culture, including an amusing vision of the possible Kanye West and Lady Gaga tour, Glover related several childhood stories. He recounted the kid dilemma of wanting to visit Toys-R-Us but instead being taken to Home Depot which, according to Glover, is “where your childhood goes to die.”
“Being a fan of [“Community”] and knowing his rap and blog, it was really cool seeing him on stage in person,” said Marinelli. “I definitely had a positive reaction to it and think that GPB chose the right person for the young Georgetown crowd.”

GUSA extended the ongoing discussion about increasing student space to fresh arrivals on campus Wednesday in hopes of garnering new student input.
Georgetown University Student Association President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Vice President GregLaverriere (COL ’12) began the forum held in the Leavey Center Club Room Wednesday night by outlining the current student space projects and their views on each proposal. They referenced the student space report completed last year that quantified the dissatisfaction many students felt regarding the current accommodations on campus.
“The report highlighted the need for more study space, more social space, more faith and spiritual space,” Laverriere said.
The vice president explained that the majority of students surveyed for the report chose the second floor of Lauinger Library as the center of campus life. When asked if they found that location desirable, however, the answer was a resounding no.
Meaney and Laverriere also expressed concerns about the proposed use of spaces in New South and the Leavey Center.
“We saw preliminary drawings of the New South Student Center this summer. Everybody was quite alarmed, because it appeared … that Georgetown was trying to do too much with too little,” Meaneysaid.
The current plan for the New South Student Center attempts to integrate social space, study space and club space. According to Meaney, such a wide-ranging proposal would poorly utilize the space.
Meaney and Laverriere suggested in meetings this summer that the New South Student Center focus solely on social space, leaving club space to the Leavey Center. For the most part, though, Meaney said they were happy with how receptive all parties in the university administration have been to their suggestions.
Other students at the forum raised concerns about what a social space in the New Student Center would entail and how it would differ from the seldom-used Alumni Lounge in Village C West.
“[Social space is] a space that you want to utilize while you’re on campus, but not while you’re studying, not while you’re sleeping, not while you’re exercising and not while you’re going to class,” Meaneyexplained.
He described it as an informal gathering place for students. Proposed uses for the student spaces include a restaurant and bar, performance space and an outdoor area that takes advantage of New South’s view of the Potomac.
Some of these, however, are also intended functions of the Alumni Lounge.
“I never go there, and most people don’t,” James Pickens (COL ’12) said. “What can we all do to make sure that the space in New South is so cool that people actually enjoy spending time there? And what steps do we need to take?”
Those in attendance agreed that the major reason for the existing lounge’s disuse centers on its location and lack of services.
“It’s literally sandwiched between hundreds of freshmen,” Meaney said.
According to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, the New South Student Center project and other plans to increase student space will be featured in the university’s upcoming capital campaign, launching in October.
“Student input gathered at the forum in July is being incorporated into an updated design. More drawings and sketches of the new space will be shared with students in the weeks ahead,” he wrote in an email.

This summer, five students joined thousands of their peers from around the globe at World Youth Day in Spain to celebrate their Catholic faith.
Accompanied by Fr. Patrick Rogers, S.J., the group prefaced the event with a 10-day Magis pilgrimage across the Spanish countryside. Sponsored by the Jesuits of Spain, Magis is a program for students from Jesuit universities that encourages learning and reflection in the spirit of the Ignatian tradition. Over 2,500 people met in Loyola, Spain, the historic home of St. Ignatius, before splitting into “Magis experience groups” that traveled around the region.
The Georgetown participants first traveled to Penafiel and Valladolid, Spain with students from Spain, France and Angola. In each city, the group toured important religious destinations while attending daily Mass in French, English or Spanish and participating in Ignatian-style reflections.
According to students, the trip fostered an international and cultural exchange both through community service and interaction with local citizens, including a local Mass in Valladolid, sung at a nursing home and attended a barbeque with the residents of Penafiel.
The Penafiel excursion was a favorite for many of Georgetown’s Magis attendees, with its mix of serious spiritual reflection and leisure.
“It’s a beautiful town with a castle, wonderful people, great food and great atmosphere,” Carlos Mercado (MSB ’13) said. “I felt we bonded really well with our group, and we experienced the Spanish culture, including drinking lots of wine and sangria. We were able to sightsee, dance at a discoteca, swim in the river next to the house we were staying at, along with prayer and the service work we did.”
The trip also allowed the students to break through the cultural and language barriers that separated them from their international peers.
“The people we met from France and Spain were very outgoing, compassionate, friendly and willing to learn about our culture,” Zachary Reese (COL ’12) said. “We even had a long discussion with them about what parts of American culture are accurately reflected in the movies.”
The pilgrimage was followed by World Youth Day, a celebration for Catholic students held in Madrid from Aug. 16–21. The culmination of the week’s events was the papal mass. Millions of Catholics camped out at Cuatro Vientos Airfield on the outskirts of Madrid in order to attend the service held by Pope Benedict XVI.
According to the students, participating in World Youth Day strengthened the students’ feelings of hope for the progress of the Catholic Church.
“It served as a reminder that there are still many young people that have faith in the Catholic tradition. This provides hope for the future of our world,” Mercado said.
Each participant also applauded the work of Fr. Pat Rogers, S.J., the group’s university chaperone.
“He was instrumental in leading our group in prayer throughout our time in Spain, and he was also very, very well-liked by the other people in our Magis Experience group. I remember one guy from Madrid say that ‘Patrick is the coolest priest I have ever met,'” Reese said.
The students added that the Magis and World Youth Day pilgrimage had both changed and strengthened their faith. For trip participant Frank Miller (COL ’14), one moment in particular stood out — climbing the mountains that surrounded the Basilica in Loyola, where St. Ignatius began his Jesuit journey.
“In addition to absolutely gorgeous view of the Basilica and surrounding towns, it genuinely moved me to simply contemplate how I was in the same place as a man who ‘set the world on fire’ and whose spirituality guides mine so much,” Miller said.
For Reese, the impact of World Youth Day stretched beyond the month of August.
“The Magis and World Youth Day events showed me how passionate young people are about the Catholic faith,” Reese said. “There was so much energy and excitement everywhere we went in Madrid, and it was contagious. It’s that energy that I hope to bring with me back to campus.”

As the 10th anniversary of 9/11 approaches, communities in the nation’s capital and largest metropolis are working to reinforce the cities’ defenses against the increased threat of further terrorist attacks.
The Department of Homeland Security confirmed on Thursday evening that it has received credible threats against Washington, D.C., and New York City for this Sunday.
“It’s accurate that there is specific, credible, but unconfirmed threat information. As we always do before important dates like the anniversary of 9/11, we will undoubtedly get more reporting in the coming days,” Homeland Security Deputy Press Secretary Matthew Chandler said in a statement Thursday night.
CNN News reported as of press time that the terror plot, which could involve a vehicle fitted with explosives masterminded by three suspects who are residing in the United States, one of whom may be a U.S. citizen.
According to Georgetown’s Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, the university has made no specific plans to increase security on campus for Sept. 11.
“We take the safety of our campus community seriously every day. Our Department of Public Safety also is in constant contact with local law enforcement,” Pugh said. “As always, they will coordinate with Metropolitan Police Department to assess and address any potential threats to the safety of our campuscommunity.”
On Wednesday, the university conducted the bi-annual test of its HOYAlert and Campus Alert notification systems, which would be utilized in the case of another terrorist attack.
The Campus Alert System’s whistles, which notify those on the Hilltop to seek shelter, first sounded at 1p.m. and ended approximately two minutes later.
Georgetown students and staff who are registered for the HOYAlert program also received test emails, text messages and recorded phone calls during this same interval of time.
Kasey Reisman (COL ’12), who lost a family member in the 9/11 attacks, said that she feels that Georgetown’s security measures are appropriate.
“I imagine that this Sunday, I will feel as safe on campus as I always do. But in the event of a terrorist threat, the university can only do so much to protect us from what is going on on a much larger scale,”Reisman said. “Realistically, the most important steps for Georgetown to take are to take this occasion seriously and keep students informed, something that I believe the university already does a good jobof.”
Though the university administration will not alter its on-campus safety procedures over the weekend, government officials throughout the capital have spent the past weeks instituting new security measures and operations.
The Washington Times reported that shortly after the federal government publicized the possible terror threat, MPD Chief Cathy Lanier announced that she will invoke a state of  “crime emergency,” allowing her to deploy more officers on 9/11.
Lanier will suspend certain scheduling clauses in the MPD’s contract with the police union, giving her the option to cancel officers’ leaves and issue them posts however she sees fit.
This latest development comes soon after Lanier’s introduction of the terrorism prevention systemiWATCHDC early this week.
The program allows users to log onto iwatchdc.dc.gov to report suspicious activity. According to MPD’swebsite, analysts review each report that is received and have the option to contact whoever filed the report to ask follow-up questions.
“We encourage anyone who witnesses what appears to be suspicious or out of the ordinary activity to report this by using iWATCHDC or calling 911,” Lanier said in a press release.
“Even though the activity may seem insignificant, it may be just the piece of information that is needed to get a clearer picture of a potential terrorist plot or criminal activity.”
iWATCHDC is separate from the police department’s crime alert service, DC Police Alert, which sends emergency notifications to local users’ cell phones, smartphones or emails.
On a national scale, the Department of Defense has already raised the alert level at all United States military bases and the Pentagon, which will be hosting an invite-only ceremony for victims’ families on the anniversary.
In New York City, NYPD is preparing to secure the World Trade Center site, which will be visited by President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush.
New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in a press release on Wednesday that thousands of additional officers, some with specialized training, will surround the Ground Zero memorial site.
At the time, Kelly said that he did not have knowledge of any prospective attacks.
Despite these security concerns, the majority of the 9/11 memorials and commemorations are scheduled to proceed normally as of press time.
For Reisman, the events of Sept. 11 hold a lasting message for Americans.
“Understandably, a lot of people feel little or no connection to the events of 9/11 because they do not know anyone affected or are not from the New York area,” she said. “However, I think it should go beyond that. It should serve as a reminder for all to cherish the ones you love, don’t take a single day for granted and take safety seriously.”

Kline and Soule’s report finds that the operating costs for Alta Gracia are almost three times that of its competitors. The authors suggest that the higher productivity of Alta Gracia workers, due to less frequent employee turnover and absenteeism, can close some of the cost discrepancy. However, the authors acknowledge that higher individual efficiency alone is not enough of a solution. The largest supplier of college apparel in the United States, Knights Apparel, offers Alta Gracia products in over 400 bookstores nationwide. Alta Gracia products perform as well in university bookstores as their competing brands; however, the product line accounts for only a small percentage of Knights’ overall production.
According to the report, to achieve a sustainable production level for the current factory, at least 40 bookstores must devote six or seven percent of their floor space to Alta Gracia products. Bozich said Knights’ other clothing lines are currently keeping Alta Gracia afloat.
While Bozich thanked University President John J. DeGioia and the university for promoting corporate social responsibility, he and his employees emphasized the importance of informing others about the beneficial impact of purchasing Alta Gracia goods.
“We’re a long way from being where we want to be,” Bozich said. “If I had one request, it would be, help us spread the word.”
Bozich hopes to eventually employ more people, build more factories and serve as an example for his competitors.
“Hopefully we’ll have such a success story that other companies will want to follow suit,” Bozich said.
Although the profit margins indicate that Alta Gracia is struggling, Kline stressed that the brand has proven its ability to sell and impact the lives of the factory workers.
“The product has proven itself in these bookstores where it’s been given decent floor space,” he said.
He added that this will be the year in which Alta Gracia’s long-term sustainability will become apparent.Bozich expects the brand’s business to double in the coming year.
“The next 18 months is a crucial time for it,” Kline said. “At this stage, it is really dependent on the collegiate consumer.”

Dean of the Masters in Professional Studies in Journalism Program Denise Li has submitted her two-weeks notice. She is leaving the School of Continuing Studies next week.
Following the announcement of a restructuring of the SCS’s journalism branch, Li informed Dean of the SCS Robert Manuel that her last day would be Sept. 16.
On Sept. 2, Manuel announced the creation of the Division of Strategic Communications, Public Relations and Journalism. This new division will encompass the MPS in Journalism program and the MPS in Public Relations and Corporate Communications program.
“The new division is an organizational structure put in place to explore the possible curricular, industry and student interest connections between the two programs,” Manuel said.
A search process for the next dean of the journalism program will begin in the coming weeks. Former Associate Dean of the Public Relations and Corporate Communications program Denise Keyes is slated to head up the new division as a senior associate dean and will be pivotal in choosing members for that search committee, according to Manuel.
Li had announced her intention to resign in June and planned to transition out during this fall semester.
“I said that I would stay until they named new leadership,” she said.
Li explained that she had completed all her responsibilities, such as finalizing the course roster and managing the start-of-term enrollment.
“Basically, I finished what I said I was going to do,” she said. “It’s a good time to pass the baton.”
Over her two-year tenure, Li added numerous course offerings, internship partnerships and at least 15 new faculty members to help expand the program’s offerings. Alumni have gone on to work at major media organizations such as CNN and NPR.
“I’m proud of the many accomplishments that we have achieved together in the last two years,” she wrote in an email.

The recent addition of five Kindle e-readers to Lauinger Library may have campus bibliophiles buzzing over a new chapter in education, but not every volume listed on the syllabus may be available in Kindle format.
For the last two months, the devices have been available for student and faculty use through theGelardin Media Center. The e-readers may be checked out for up to a month at a time, and just one day after announcing the new Kindles, the library had filled their rental slots through October.
There’s no guarantee students can optimize the rental for class use, however.
While the Kindle store offers nearly a million general interest titles for purchase, as well as monthly textbook rentals for as little as one dollar, its collection of college material is rather sparse. For example, only two of the 13 books required for one “Elements of Political Theory” course at Georgetown —which can be purchased new at the bookstore for about $200 — are available through Amazon.
At the start of this school year, Amazon only offered 18 of the top 100 college textbooks, according toCampusBooks.com. Even among those 18 textbooks, only five were available for the cheapest rental period.
“Academic books are trailing because there isn’t as much commercial value,” Beth Marhanka, department head of Gelardin explained. “It’s just like with movie rentals — feature films are available first, then you get to the documentaries with academic content.”
Lauinger has been expanding its collection of online e-books for years and now offers 10s of thousands of books electronically. Since the legality of loaning Kindle content has been a contentious subject, Lauinger’s Kindle borrowers must purchase e-books out of pocket.
The basic Kindle put out by Amazon.com, which retails for $114, is the top-selling e-book reader, selling millions of units since its 2007 release. The latest $379 Kindle DX, the version that Georgetown offers, can hold 3,500 books while offering tools such as highlighting, note-taking and a dictionary.
“I think what libraries need to be concerned with is the content, not the format,” Marhanka said. “It’s incredibly important for libraries to be on top of this huge change in information technology.”
Even as the number of course books available electronically has risen, recent trends show Georgetown students remain print devotees. According to Lauinger’s Stacks Services Coordinator Claire Corbett, the number of printed books being checked out has remained relatively constant over the last few years despite the rise of electronic alternatives.
“When we work with researchers, faculty and graduate students, they almost always prefer to use hard copies of books,” Corbett said. “It seems to only be some undergraduates who prefer electronicresearch.”
Corbett noted that she has encountered some library patrons in the past who were angry that a certain text was only available electronically.
“People like holding the book and turning the pages, and they also might want to highlight or take notes on the pages, and you can’t do that with something like Kindle,” she said.
While e-readers have encountered substantial scrutiny from those who find a distinct intimacy with reading print material, Marhanka likens the situation to what occurred during the transition to online research journals, which students now access almost entirely online.
And though the dawn of Kindle at Lauinger is generating buzz, Marhanka said the Amazon product may not be the answer for academics. Rather, she sees a growth opportunity for tablet devices likeiPads moving forward.
“Kindle is really wonderful for reading novels, but if you’re getting into academic books, you need color and multimedia,” Marhanka said. “What I find really exciting is when, in an e-text, you can click on a picture and it becomes a video. When you have the content of a book and the capabilities of electronics, it’s the best of both worlds.”
In 2009, Amazon announced a pilot project that first introduced Kindles to college campuses. About 50 students at seven universities, including Case Western Reserve University and Princeton University, were given Kindles to use in their classes. iPads, which tend to be more popular among college students, have also become available for students at many colleges. The University of Maryland, Reed College and the University of Notre Dame all recently implemented programs that distributed iPads, according to a report by the Chronicle for Higher Education.

Washington Harbour owner MRP Realty recently unveiled plans to build a 9,000-foot ice rink as part of its efforts to drastically revitalize the Georgetown waterfront.
According to Julie Chase, CEO of Chase PR and a representative of MRP, the rink will be the cornerstone of the company’s renovation plans.
Chase said that this attraction will improve the Harbour’s business atmosphere by drawing consumers down to the waterfront during the latter part of the year.
“A lot of people when they come to Washington Harbour, they think of a sunny day by the water. This is meant to bring more people together in the winter. Anyone of all ages can get together [at the ice rink] and have a good time,” she said.
“[The goal is] to improve the waterfront so it’s a wonderful attraction for Georgetown and more people can enjoy it more consistently.”
At the proposed size, the ice rink would be the largest of its kind in the District. According to JamesBracco, the executive director of the Georgetown Business Improvement District, the rink would draw visitors to the area.
“[Washington Harbour] is absolutely a destination for a lot of folks coming into town,” Bracco said, noting that tour buses routinely drop visitors at the entrance area on K Street.
“I think [the ice rink] would be a huge plus, based on what I’ve heard and seen of the plan. It might well be the biggest patch of ice in the city. It would be an awesome addition to the complex,” he added.
MRP, which has already started renovating the interior of the Washington Harbour office buildings, is also planning on creating a more upscale setting for its restaurants and bars.
Chase said that the realty company wants to provide the waterfront’s eateries with a more sophisticated atmosphere, designed to attract Georgetown’s professional clientele during the lunch and dinner hours.
Among the improvements under consideration is a 7,000-square-foot fountain; set to replace the current water feature, the design will serve as a focal point for the businesses’ new outdoor seating area.
While MRP works on plans for improvement, the company also faces a $5 million class-action lawsuit for flooding that damaged its property last spring.
The majority of the eateries that made their home on the waterfront, including Tony and Joe’s Seafood Place, Nick’s Riverside Grille, Cabanas and Farmers & Fishers, were forced to shut their doors on April 18 after the Potomac River flooded the fountain and its surrounding shops.
A group of employees from the restaurants on site filed the complaint, claiming that the managing company’s failure to raise the property’s floodgates was negligent.
In late June, the class-action lawsuit, originally filed by Mason LLP on behalf of Charles Holcomb, a bartender at Farmers and Fishers, expanded to 39 more plaintiffs, most of them employees of waterfront restaurants.
According to a message posted on the website of Tony and Joe’s Seafood Place, the interiors of several Washington Harbour eateries had to be fully gutted after the storm.
The restaurant does not list an exact date for the reopening of its indoor dining area, but it has made its outside bar and grille accessible to customers.
Dan Simons, concept developer and managing director of Farmers Restaurant Group, wrote in an email that he is encouraged by MRP’s efforts to revitalize the property.
“The renovations and plans for Washington Harbour sound exciting, and we are hopeful that MRP is successful with everything they’re seeking to do,” he wrote. “We believe that Washington Harbour can be a fabulous all-year-round destination. We continue our dialogue with MRP as we look for a solution that will allow Farmers & Fishers to re-open in 2012.”
While these renovations may assist Washington Harbour’s businesses recover from the flood’s effects, Chase said that her clients were prepared to make changes to the property long before the natural disaster struck.
“As soon as [MRP Realty] bought the property [in June 2010 for $244.5 million], they started reviewing how to improve it. This has been happening from the beginning,” she said.
Chase added that the planning stages of the revamp are far from over, as MRP’s ideas must undergo review by the Advisory Neighborhood Commission and the Old Georgetown Board.
The owners of Tony and Joe’s Seafood Place, Nick’s Riverside Grille and Cabanas could not be reached for comment at press time.
