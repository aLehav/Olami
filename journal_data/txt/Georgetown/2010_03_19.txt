As students set off to find affordable off-campus housing in the area, a new initiative by the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs aims to help potential tenants of basement apartments find their match.
By heading to rentmydcbasement.com, owners can access helpful resources regarding leasing, such as instructions on how to obtain a rental license and a checklist of safety standards that must be satisfied in order to meet D.C. building codes.
Building code requirements include a minimum ceiling height, proper light and ventilation, adequate emergency escape access, reliable and level walking surfaces, and sufficient appliance, electrical and facilities upkeep. Owners must also ensure that doors and windows are weather-tight, renters have access to a fire extinguisher, and bedrooms are free from items such as gas meters.
Catherine Dokurno (COL ’12), who is looking to rent an apartment this summer, said she thought the site would be a useful resource.
“I would definitely want some kind of group to help guide me through the process and make sure it would be a legitimate transaction because I would have no idea how to differentiate between a safe and legitimate deal and a shady one,” Dokurno said.
Cat Skolnicki (COL ’13) was pleased to hear of the Web site, saying she has noticed some unsafe conditions in area apartments.
“I was in someone’s basement apartment in Georgetown recently and definitely saw more than one violation of the items on that safety list,” she said. “This basement had walls made completely of exposed insulation and huge cracks.”
An initial DCRA attempt to improve rental conditions for students, thisshouldbeillegal.com, was launched in 2008 and allows students to verify if their landlord is licensed by providing access to online databases. The Web site also contains an inspection checklist and fire safety tips.
While some students worried over rentals’ adherence to safety codes, others stuck with a simple mantra: cheaper is better, even if an apartment is unlicensed.
“I’m sure these Web sites are helpful, but a lack of licensure wouldn’t deter me from renting a place,” Joe Mekhail (COL ’13) said. “For college students on a budget, it’s more important to get a more affordable rental than to have level staircases.”

With the primary elections less than six months away, the races for D.C. Council and mayoral seats are intensifying. On the mayoral side, current D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty, a Democrat, has announced his plans to seek re-election to a second term, despite recent opposition to his policies on contracts, the public school system and the attorney general, among other issues, from members of the D.C. Council.
Last week, Fenty surpassed the campaign fundraising record which he set in 2006, collecting more than $327,300 in five weeks to bring his total campaign funds to more than $3.9 million, according to The Washington Post.
The fundraising totals put Fenty well above the early returns for his potential mayoral challengers, but with a public approval rating of 42 percent – almost half of his approval rating in 2008 — the race could be a struggle for the incumbent mayor.
But the numbers alone are not enough for Councilmember Michael Brown (I-at-large), who is considering a run at the mayoral seat.
“Just because people don’t like someone, it doesn’t necessarily translate voting for the other person,” said Brown, whose D.C. Council term expires in 2012.
Because of his independent status, Brown is not required to participate in the primaries and has not yet made a formal announcement of his mayoral candidacy. Instead, he said he will base his decision of whether or not to run in the general election on Fenty’s primary performance. If Fenty wins, then Brown will challenge him in the general elections. Brown said he would not run if Council Chairman Vincent Gray (D) wins the Democratic primary against Fenty.
“I would be pleased that he would win, because I like his style of leadership,” Brown said.
Gray, whose City Council term expires this year, has made no formal announcement regarding his mayoral candidacy, despite a Clarus Research Group poll which has him at a 4-point lead in a hypothetical race against Fenty.
“Chairman Gray continues to talk with residents and examine the political landscape as he assesses what decision would be best for the District of Columbia and that will help him determine what is in his future in the coming days,” said Doxie McCoy, a spokesperson for Gray.
Another potential mayoral challenger is R. Donahue Peebles, chairman and CEO of the Peebles Corporation, the nation’s largest African-American real estate group, who might be retracting on his earlier claim that he would not run because of his mother’s life-threatening illness.
The Council races are also up in the air, with Democrat Jim Graham seeking a fourth term in Ward 1. His potential challengers include former D.C. Board of Education member Jeff Smith and Bryan Weaver, commissioner of the Adams Morgan Advisory Neighborhood Commission.
Finances, however, might stand in the way of Weaver, who has yet to make a final announcement.
“There is a daunting element to this,” he said, citing finances and challenging a long-time incumbent as possible hurdles to an election.
Weaver has assembled an exploratory committee to look into his chances and the financial feasibility of a campaign, but has said that he will wait before announcing his candidacy.
Ward 6, centered on Capitol Hill, is also shaping up to be a tight race, with incumbent Tommy Wells – who has the second-highest fundraising totals among incumbent Council members, behind Graham – set to face a Republican in the elections.
Democrats outnumber Republicans eight-to-one in the Ward, according to Wells’ chief of staff Charles Allen, but it hasn’t stopped Jim DeMartino, a former Navy consultant, from announcing his bid as a Republican challenger.
Wells will formally kick-off his re-election campaign on March 26, Allen said.
DeMartino could not be reached for comment.

Although Georgetown has made strides in increasing the presence of women in the administration and faculty, men still outnumber women in leadership positions at the university.
Of the 36 members of the Board of Directors, six are women, or 16.7 percent, the third-lowest percentage of the top 25 national universities in the country. Only the University of Chicago and Washington University in St. Louis have a lower percentage of females on their governing boards, out of the top 25 schools as ranked by U.S. News & World Report.
The average percentage of women on university governing boards is 26.5 percent.
“Members of the Board of Directors are elected by the board. The gender composition of the board fluctuates as members retire and new members are elected,” Andy Pino, director of media relations, said.
Laura Kovach, director of the university’s Women’s Center, said she would like to see more women on the board.
“I would like to see more women engaged,” she said. “It’s important to have women involved at all levels at Georgetown.”
“Is it a problem that we don’t have many women advancing through ranks? Yes,” said Cathy Tinsley, executive director of the Georgetown University Women’s Leadership Initiative.
“The issue, though, is not a [Georgetown] one. It is one endemic to higher [education],” she said.
According to Tinsley, there is no easily identifiable reason for this trend.
“[It’s] likely to be a very complex network of reasons,” she said.
Board Chair Paul Tagliabue (CAS ’62) did not respond to requests for comment. The female members of the board did not respond to requests for comment or could not be reached.
Men also outnumber women in executive officer positions, the highest administrative positions in the university. Of the 18 executive officers of the university – which includes the main campus, Law Center, Medical Center and the School of Foreign Service in Qatar – five are women. Five of the 15 main campus executive officers are women.
“I think the university has a respectable representation [of women] at the senior administration level,” said Rosemary Kilkenny, vice president for institutional diversity and equity in the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action.
She noted that minority women were especially underrepresented at Georgetown, including at the executive officer level; Kilkenny is the only woman of color to serve in such a capacity at both the university and the main campus.
Given these statistics, however, Kilkenny stated that this is an improvement from the past.
“There has been a steady increase in the number of women who have ascended to high-level positions,” Kilkenny said.
According to Kilkenny, 39 percent of full-time faculty on the main campus are women, up from 35 percent in 2000.
According to the American Association of University Professors, in 2006, 30.2 percent of tenured faculty members at Georgetown were women and 22.7 percent of full professors were women. Georgetown is above the national average for the percentage of full-time faculty, tenured faculty and full professors who are women.
Kilkenny said that the university is currently compiling updated data on diversity in all employment categories, but that the most recent data is not yet available.
While women only make up about a third – 32.7 percent – of department and program chairs, almost half – 46.7 percent – of Georgetown deans are female.
The university is required by federal law to have an affirmative action plan and to ensure that the percentage of women and minorities hired in all job categories is not below the availability index for that category. The availability index is the percentage of people qualified for a certain type of job that are women and minorities.
Georgetown employs fewer women than the availability index in some categories, including senior faculty and executive officers, but exceeds the requirement in others, such as mid-level paraprofessionals.
Kilkenny said the university posts job advertisements targeted at women and minorities and reaches out to professional networks to attract more women and minorities to apply for jobs at Georgetown.
“These efforts need to be expanded,” she said.
Kilkenny said the university needs to create more opportunities for women to advance within the ranks of the university once hired.
“We have some structural challenges to overcome,” she said. She said the university should consider telecommuting, job sharing, more child-care options and other flexibility measures that would facilitate a balance between women’s jobs and other commitments.
“The opportunities for professional growth and development are certainly there,” she said.
The first women to enroll at Georgetown spent a year at the Medical School in the 1880-1881 school year. The School of Nursing and Health Studies has admitted women since its founding in 1904, and the last undergraduate school to admit women was the College of Arts and Sciences in 1969. According to U.S. News & World Report, the undergraduate student body is currently 53.7 percent female.
*This article is part one of a three-part series on women at Georgetown.*
**Correction:** This article originally stated that in 2006, 30.2 percent of tenured faculty members nationwide were women and 22.7 percent of full professors were women. The percentages cited were a measure of women faculty presence at Georgetown, not nationwide.”

Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justice took to Red Square Wednesday afternoon to protest the university’s stance on reproductive issues, this time drawing onlookers in a skit inspired by St. Patrick’s Day.
In a performance by members of the recently formed coalition of H*yas for Choice and United Feminists, a student portrayed University President John J. DeGioia as a leprechaun hoarding “a pot of gold” full of condoms. Other Plan A members encouraged spectators to sign a petition to the administration regarding reproductive rights issues on campus.
“[The skit’s] goal was to highlight the ways that Georgetown’s policies around sexual health are negatively impacting the lives of students on campus,” Kristina Mitchell (COL ’10), a member of United Feminists who recently became involved in Plan A, said in an e-mail.
Mitchell said she was pleased with the number of students who came to the event.
“We had a great turnout, and were able to elicit a lot of interest from students and other passers-by,” Mitchell concluded. “Plan A is definitely making progress, which has become evident through the overwhelming support of our efforts on the part of the student body, faculty and staff.”
The group brought a letter of protest to the Office of the President on March 4, three days after the Student Activities Commission approved funding for an upcoming Plan A event on abortion rights in a landmark vote.
Other members of the Georgetown community, however, including members of GU Right to Life, strongly opposed the message of Wednesday’s demonstration.
“I did not see Plan A’s demonstration,” said Ellie Hook (COL ’12), president of GU Right to Life, in an e-mail. “However, I have heard a great deal about it and have talked to many students who were grossly offended by Plan A’s distasteful and childish display.”
Hook also addressed the approach the group employed in conveying its message.
“I feel that mocking President DeGioia is a strategically stupid move to make as well. Do they now feel that he will respond to their letter/proposal in a positive way?”
Hook said her greatest concern is not Wednesday’s demonstration, but rather the claims and messages being propagated by Plan A’s marketing efforts on campus. Hook cited statements written on Plan A fliers that the Georgetown University Hospital does not provide rape kits.
“In placing fliers around campus that state that Georgetown [University] Hospital has no rape kits, could that not make women feel that if they are raped, they have no one to turn to, nowhere to go?” Hook said.
Rape kits are administered at the Washington Hospital Center, the only location in D.C. permitted to do so.
Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justice has lobbied the administration this semester to change its policies regarding these issues.
“We got a vague and essentially un-responsive letter from Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson after we delivered our first letter on Feb. 5, and he has not yet scheduled a meeting with us,” Mitchell said. “His actions further deny students a forum in which to voice concerns about these issues.”
Olson responded to the letter from Plan A in a letter on Feb. 24, per DeGioia’s request.
“Georgetown’s policies and practices rest on the strong underpinning of Catholic social and moral teaching and its affirmation of the dignity of all persons from the beginning of life to its natural end,” Olson wrote in the letter. “I recognize that these are complex questions and that there are divergent points of view on the issues that you raise; that is why our policies and practices encourage debate and conversation. Nonetheless, as a Catholic and Jesuit university our policies must reflect our identity and our values.”
According to Mitchell, this is consistent with the university’s longstanding attitude toward reproductive issues.
“President DeGioia’s failure to address reproductive justice in a genuine way is quite clearly a continuation of Georgetown’s general protocol of ignoring and neglecting sexual health issues, but it is still disappointing to see such a blatant lack of engagements on President DeGioia’s part when our attempts to open a dialogue have been so direct,” she said.
Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justice, according to its blog, is “a coalition of students dedicated to changing the way that Georgetown University approaches issues of reproductive justice and choice.” The group is not officially recognized by the administration, and does not receive access to benefits from the university, according to Ruiyong Chen (SFS ’13), a SAC commissioner. “

“We are all fragile, we are all broken people,” Fr. Rick Curry, S.J. said in a tightly packed Healy Hall classroom Thursday evening. “If we connect in our brokenness, then I think we have a chance.”
Curry’s words captured the mood of students who participated in the first-ever “Hate Free Georgetown” week, which began Monday with petition signing and distribution of anti-violence campaign buttons in the Leavey Center. Embracing dialogue and its power to curb incidents of intolerance on campus, participants joined in a series of events that brought lectures, performances and a meditation session to campus.
Curry discussed the power of communication in addressing hate, drawing from his own experiences as an amputee. Curry founded the National Theatre Workshop of the Handicapped, an international acting school for people with physical disabilities. He argued that humans are linked by the fact that they have flaws, that they are imperfect.
Curry said many people avoid those with disabilities because they simply do not understand the differing perspective, describing any lack of active engagement with others as “sins of omission.”
For Dalvin Butler (COL ’13), Curry’s topic of disability discrimination offered lessons for other bases of prejudice. Butler said that the lack of dialogue about all types of discrimination only reinforced such intolerance.
“We’re in a society where many people don’t talk about certain things of that nature,” Butler said. “I do agree on how he made a parallel between how people in society treat the disabled and those who are homosexual.”
Donning buttons – which incorporated the peace sign into the Georgetown “G” – and dancing in Red Square, nearly 800 students had signed a petition pledging their support for nonviolence by Wednesday, according to Joshua Goode (COL ’10), one of the week’s organizers. While other programs in the past have focused on finding resources to cope with hate, this week-long event focused more on forming a culture that bars the development of hate, Goode said. The devices organizers used were artistic expression and the creation of dialogue among different members of the campus community.
“A big part of nonviolence is finding other ways to use that energy,” Goode said before Tuesday’s dance concert in Red Square. About 100 people gathered outside White-Gravenor Hall to watch performance groups, including Groove Theory and Ballet Folklorico. The event – meant to raise awareness of the week – mirrored a top goal organizers have set: communication among campus groups. When Ballet Folklorico performed, Groove Theory members interpreted the ballet soundtrack through their own dance techniques.
“I think that one thing we learned over the past two years is that the performing arts have a very powerful visceral effect,” Goode said. “What the arts do is they attempt to go for your heart.”
Thursday night, New York-based folk artist Mal Blum and her band performed in Bulldog Alley and discussed their experiences in the music industry, and Blum, who self-identifies as queer, reflected on her personal experiences.
The week concludes on Saturday with a performance festival in McNeir Auditorium. Goode and other event organizers compiled a list of six words relating to hate and have sought one-word responses throughout the week from students. Those responses will be woven into a written reflection piece that will keynote the performance.
“The emphasis of this is a community coming together,” Goode said of the reflection piece.
Artistic events like Tuesday’s exhibition and Saturday’s planned performance are especially powerful due to their reliance on positive imagination, Curry said in his address Thursday evening.
“The arts are about the life of the imagination,” he said. “The imagination is about the life of the human spirit. If you’re in a situation where you’re leaning on your imagination then you’re in good shape.”
Other events this week included an interfaith discussion hosted by the Jewish Student Association, a Georgetown University Grilling Society barbecue serving free burgers to the first 125 participants and a field day co-sponsored by GU Pride and Hoya Blue. Funding for Hate Free Georgetown was provided by The Corp, the Georgetown University Student Association, Nomadic Theatre, GU Pride and the LGBTQ Resource Center.

Following the sudden resignation of Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority General Manager John Catoe in January, the WMATA board of directors has appointed former New Jersey Transit Executive Director Richard Sarles as interim general manager.
According to a March 4 press release announcing the appointment, Sarles will take up the post on March 29 and will earn a salary of $25,000. His contract is for a year but can be renewed.
Catoe, Sarles’ predecessor, served for three years as general manager, and despite presiding over the WMATA during the June 2009 Red line crash that killed nine people, he was awarded a three-year contract extension by the board in January.
According to the press release, Catoe said that he faced no pressure from the board to resign.
Sarles has 25 years of experience with Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Port Authorities of New Jersey and New York. During these periods, he completed several high-profile projects such as directing Amtrak’s $2 billion high-speed rail project in the Northeast Corridor, the line that runs between Washington, D.C., and Boston, and spearheading the opening of the River LINE light-rail service in southern New Jersey.
New Jersey Transit’s 11,000 employees and 800,000 passengers daily are comparable to those of the Metro, which has 10,000 employees and 1.2 million passengers each day.
According to Peter Benjamin, chairman of the WMATA board of directors, Sarles’ experience as a transit manager would be invaluable as the board searches for Catoe’s permanent replacement.
“The selection of Mr. Sarles is an important step in the board’s efforts to address safety and other important Metro issues,” Benjamin said in a press release. “Richard Sarles has a passion for transportation and the ability and know-how to help Metro regain the public trust and confidence in the system that serves the nation’s capital and passengers from across the region and around the world.”
As interim general manager, Sarles’ focus will be to set the stage for the future general manager, according to Benjamin.
“As interim general manager, he is not expected to solve every problem,” he said in a press conference. “Rather, he is expected to build a foundation upon which the future general manager and the Metro team would base their long-term efforts.”
In a press conference, Sarles, who has worked in the transportation system since his college internships, made it clear he is not vying for the permanent general manager spot.
“I am taking this position as interim GM because Metro is a vital public transportation system, not only in this region but as a symbol in the entire country, and I believe I can make a valuable contribution in the efforts underway to correct problems and rebuild confidence,” he said.

Arlington, Va., resident Todd Thomas was sentenced March 12 to more than 26 years in prison for crimes including burglary and assaults on five male Georgetown students in 2007 and 2008, according to The Washington Post. The ruling follows reports of two similar crimes perpetrated against males in the Georgetown community in late February.
The attacks for which Thomas has been convicted occurred in the 1200 and 1300 blocks of 33rd and 35th Streets NW, according to the Post. The victims of these crimes awoke in the night to find Thomas in their apartments. At times he was massaging or groping their shoulders and ankles, and on one occasion Thomas sexually assaulted one of the victims.
Department of Public Safety records list two sexual assaults in 2007, one in Village A and one on 35th Street. The three sexual assaults that reportedly occurred on campus in 2008 took place in LXR and Village A in April, and Nevils in May.
According to the Post, a jury found Thomas guilty of 11 charges in November, and he remained in a D.C. jail until his sentencing by D.C. Superior Court Judge Gregory E. Jackson last Friday.
At press time, it could not be confirmed if Thomas was linked to burglaries and sexual assaults attributed to any suspect or suspects colloquially designated as the “Georgetown Cuddler.”
DPS and the Metropolitan Police Department have not traced one common suspect to this string of crimes, which are most commonly break-ins and assaults perpetrated against women. Following a string of burglaries and assaults on and off campus in late August and early September, Vice President for University Safety Rocco DelMonaco noted similarities among incidents but said authorities were having difficulty pinning the crimes on one suspect.
While women are often the victims of burglaries and assaults in the Georgetown area, two similar crimes in 2010 have been perpetrated against males.
The most recent crime – a burglary and sexual assault – occurred near campus in a residence in the area of 35th and T Streets on Feb. 28 and was reported by a male victim unaffiliated with the university on March 2, according to a public safety alert.
A male student reported his house burglarized on Feb. 22, a public safety alert stated. The suspect broke into the home and left after the victim awoke and asked the suspect what he was doing in the house.
The suspects in each of these crimes committed against males are described as white males wearing or possibly wearing a dark-colored jacket.
Authorities do not believe Thomas is linked to any recent burglaries or assaults in the Georgetown area.

The Student Activities Commission and Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriations Committee SAC Liaison Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) reached a consensus Thursday evening on two of the three outstanding conditions of the six-point funding reform plan that block SAC from receiving its full Student Activities Fee allocation.
 
According to Laverriere, he and SAC have come up with feasible plans to address GUSA’s concerns about SAC’s accountability to student groups and usage of their reserve funds for immediate club needs. All five advisory boards and Georgetown Program Board have been asked to comply with the six-point funding reform plan.
 
 
 
Before Thursday’s meeting, SAC complied with three of the six conditions in the plan, including maintaining an appeals process, giving student groups control over the funds that they raise and creating a program to expand the budgets of student organizations. Its refusal to adhere to new GUSA standards resulted in a draft budget allocation of $12,500, a third amount SAC requested.
 
 
 
Laverriere and SAC did not, however, come to a consensus regarding the stipulation of meetings’ transparency, under which SAC commissioners’ votes would be made public.
 
 
 
Laverriere said he believes the two bodies will reconcile on this point of contention in the near future.
 
 
 
“I’m confident that in the weeks ahead we will be able to come to an agreement. We made a lot of good progress [last night],” Laverriere said. “This is the type of thing where we need to sit on what we discussed and come back to it.”
 
 
 
Laverriere will formally present the results of the meeting to the Finance and Appropriations Committee on Wednesday for approval. If the committee approves, the five reform points accepted by both parties will be formalized in a written agreement in order to ensure the smooth proceedings of future budget funding allocations.
 
 
 
“I would say that tonight shows progress can be made with reforming SAC, albeit gradually. [Laverriere has] done a great job working with SAC and because of his efforts, I am still hopeful that this is going to turn out well. We are going to get this right because it’s what we have to do,” Sen. Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), member of the Finance and Appropriations Committee, said.
 
 
 
According to Laverriere, the two groups continue to clash on the issue of public voting because SAC leaders have articulated a need to protect their commissioners’ interests.
 
 
 
“We believe that, if anything, [public voting] would create more dialogue and construct a better event that gets approved,” he said.
 
 
 
If the two groups are unable to come to a consensus through further dialogue, the case will be presented to a neutral university administrator for arbitration.
 
 
 
“I’m confident that through more discussion, it’s possible that this won’t even be necessary,” Laverriere said.
 
 
 
On the topic of reducing SAC reserves, Laverriere and SAC have designed a tentative plan to spend from SAC’s reserves the difference between the total amount requested from GUSA and the final amount allocated, or $12,500 if the advisory board is granted its full allocation of $25,000. The SAC reserve fund currently has a total of $215,000; this amount includes an excess reserve of $65,000, as all of the advisory boards are asked by the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs to maintain a $150,000 balance. In an e-mail sent to student organizations on Monday, SAC Chair Ethel Amponsah (NHS ’11) said that she would like to use the reserve funds to make broad-based improvements.
 
 
 
“[Spending down reserves] is not sustainable as within two years the excess funds would be depleted, and SAC would still receive insufficient funds from FinApp,” Amponsah said in the e-mail. “Instead, the commission would like to use the funds to address some of your expressed concerns and needs such as space renovations and increased storage.”
 
 
 
Laverriere stated that if SAC follows his suggested plan, the commission will still have $50,000 in excess reserves to spend on heftier projects such as student space.
 
 
 
“While I can’t mandate [that this plan] is what they do, that is the voice of the students, and if they decide otherwise, they will get complaints suggesting why [student organization] budget allocations are going to be decreased when they have money to spend,” he said.
 
 
 
According to Malkerson, the Center for Social Justice Advisory Board of Student Organizations also has particularly large reserves, but has presented a feasible plan to reduce their reserve level.
 
 
 
A preliminary deal has been struck on future SAC commissioner appointment and re-appointment. Under the proposal, new applications will be reviewed by the SAC chair, who will then select applicants to be voted on by all SAC groups for final confirmation. Returning commissioners will also be subject to a vote by the student groups they specifically oversee. If more than half of the groups vote unfavorably, the reappointment application will be then reviewed by the SAC chair, the Finance and Appropriations Committee SAC liaison and the university SAC adviser for a final decision.
 
 
 
“While it’s important to get the student feedback, it’s also important to look at it holistically and bring in different eyes,” Laverriere said.
 
 
 
According to Laverriere, if the appointment reform measure is approved, it will take effect starting in spring 2011.
 
 
 
Both parties have sought the guidance of university administrators in dealing with funding reform debates. The Finance and Appropriations Committee met with Jeanne Lord, associate vice president for student affairs, Erika Cohen-Derr, director of student programs and Lynne Hirschfeld, associate dean for finance and administration in the university student affairs office on Wednesday. SAC will also meet with the same three administrators next week.
The Finance and Appropriations Committee will formally pass its final budget proposal for the advisory boards and Georgetown Program Board on Wednesday before sending it to the GUSA Senate for approval. The committee will likely only consider budgets for the other five advisory boards and set SAC’s final budget allocation at a later date.
 
 
 
“It is possible that due to these extended talks . SAC’s budget will not be included with the annual [Student Activities Fee] budget next week. Rather, the commission may be funded through a supplemental allocation later this month or next, depending on the outcome of our discussions,” Nick Troiano (COL ’11), chair of the Finance and Appropriations Committee, said.
 
 
 
While Laverriere is certain that SAC’s budget allocation will be finalized by the end of the year, he said he cannot establish an exact timeline because of administrative meeting scheduling purposes. “The sooner the better, but we’re making sure that we look at every route possible in finding compromises,” Laverriere said.
 
 
 
In the e-mail Amponsah sent to student organizations, she claimed that many of them may experience reduced funding if SAC receives a lower budget allocation from GUSA.
 
 
 
“The marked decrease in funds will undoubtedly limit what SAC is able to fund,” she wrote in the e-mail. “. With rising space costs, new organizations and a desire for more elaborate programming, the Commission will have to decrease allocations. We are considering a decrease in standard operating budgets and are reviewing all allocations made.”
 
 
 
This led to anger and dismay among some of the student organizations that receive funding from SAC.
 
 
 
“We feel that there is no reason that SAC and GUSA should have this standoff and the longer they fight about it, the longer it will hurt clubs like us. This tiff that they’re having puts us in a really awkward position and the announcement that [SAC is] planning on cutting allocation puts the burden of conflict in our laps,” Georgetown University College Democrats President Brian Woll (COL ’12) said. “We had nothing to do with their inability to compromise, and yet we’re being punished by it.”
 
 
 
Other groups are uneasy over the threat of the possible budget cuts that would occur if they are granted fewer operating resources.
 
 
 
“[We are] gravely concerned about the future budgetary funding through SAC.
 
 
 
This year, SAC has allocated sufficient funding for AASA to execute exciting, pluralistic events for the Pan-Asian and the greater Georgetown community. We are now conscious that we will have to heavily rely on other financial sources, such as Diversity Action Council, Center for Multicultural Equity Access’ Student Of Color Alliance and [the] Lecture Fund,” Lisa He (SFS ’11), president of the Asian American Student Association, said.
 
 
 
In the wake of such responses, the Finance and Appropriations Committee has reaffirmed what it considers its first priority: resolving any disagreements it has with SAC.
 
 
 
“It is clear that SAC is unnecessarily holding groups’ budgets hostage as they continue to wage a petty battle with GUSA, which is advocating issues resoundingly supported by clubs and the student body. Ultimately, our Committee will do everything it can to ensure student clubs have access to the funding they need, and we are confident we will be able to do so,” Troiano said in an e-mail.
 
 
 
“I’ve been a firm believer that if, at the end of the day, SAC doesn’t receive an allocation from GUSA, I have failed as a GUSA senator and the commission has failed, as well, in our duties to students. It is in no way OK to push this decision down the line to next year,” Laverriere said. “This is an issue that has been years in the making, and it’s time that the lid be put on it.”

Despite a lagging economy, Ted Leonsis has beaten the odds, fostering growth in three successful businesses in recent years.
Ted Leonsis, former AOL vice president and owner of the Washington Capitals, recently published a book titled “The Business of Happiness,” in which he revealed that one of his secrets to business success is happiness. Instead of taking the standard route of throwing a launch party and book signing, he opted to hold a panel discussion with other successful entrepreneurs in the Rafik B. Hariri Building Monday evening.
In a discussion of the “double bottom line,” panel members demonstrated that it is possible to be a successful entrepreneur and a philanthropist. The “double bottom line” is a business term that describes enterprises that fulfill social responsibility while continuing to turn a profit.
Leonsis said that he has been blessed to experience success in his three business endeavors, Revolution Money, the Washington Capitals and SnagFilms amid the economic climate. “By following tenants in the book, I got successful enough to gain confidence to share the secret with other people,” said Leonsis, explaining his motivation to write a book.
The discussion was moderated by University President John J. DeGioia, a college friend of Leonsis. The panel also included Tom Adams, founder and chief executive officer of Rosetta Stone; Donald Graham, chairman of The Washington Post Company; Sheila Johnson, co-founder of Black Entertainment Television; and Joseph Robert, chairman and CEO of J.E. Robert Companies.
The auditorium was nearly full with students, alumni, faculty and members of the D.C. business community, and the 90-minute discussion incited jokes and laughter.
After brief remarks by McDonough School of Business Dean George Daly and DeGioia, Leonsis opened the discussion by touting his philosophy of “doing well by doing good,” stating that the pursuit of happiness involving community can strengthen businesses.
Panelists then discussed how this philosophy resonated for them on a personal level.
Johnson emphasized creativity, or “coming out of the box,” in helping others. Johnson said that her time at Parsons The New School for Design inspired her to utilize a variety of methods such as film and a magazine-format show with teens to address social issues.
Adams stated that the foreign language education business itself works for the common good, but Rosetta Stone in particular promotes corporate responsibility by partaking in the preservation of Native American languages.
Adams advised students that they pursue careers in sectors that they are passionate about.
Daly said it was refreshing to see that the business and social awareness are not mutually exclusive ideas but can be mutually supportive.
“We also try to have this [philosophy] as a component of every course we teach,” Daly said. “We give it particular focus in our required courses in ethics and in the Social Enterprise program being developed by professor Bill Novelli, the former CEO of AARP.”

In November of last year, the Georgetown University Student Association Senate passed a resolution calling for a change in the way the five campus advisory boards and the Georgetown Program Board fund student activities. Among other things, the senate called for open votes on funding, a process for the selection of new members that would be accountable to the groups they represent and plans for the spending of some funds in advisory board reserve accounts.
These reforms were crafted in response to complaints by students about the advisory boards made during a club summit, a club survey and by individual students to their senators. Four advisory boards and GPB have either complied with all of these points as written or reached a compromise solution with GUSA. One board has not.
The Student Activities Commission has refused to open its votes to the public. SAC also has not outlined a plan to spend down reserves. A recent assessment by the Office of Student Affairs has finally pinned down the worth of SAC’s reserve funds at about $215,000. Given this considerable value – which is $65,000 higher than what the vice president’s office recommends that SAC hold in reserves – SAC ought to stop feeding its reserve account, and instead pass on this surplus to the students.
Perhaps most importantly, SAC has refused to change the self-selecting, unaccountable process by which it chooses its own members. This process is what ensures that, year after year, SAC’s institutional culture remains unchanged.
Despite SAC’s inaction, the GUSA Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee has allocated SAC $12,500 in the draft budget for fiscal year 2010, as a symbol of its good faith, and recognition that SAC has made strides to comply with some reforms. It also has set aside an additional $12,500 that will be allocated as soon as the final reforms are completed.
I have no doubt that some members of SAC will portray the draft budget as a ploy by the Finance and Appropriations Committee to undermine SAC at the expense of student groups on campus. Indeed, the chairperson of SAC has already sent out a letter to that effect to each of the student organizations under SAC jurisdiction.
The reality is that nothing could be further from the truth.
Simply put, SAC is holding student activities hostage in an attempt to preserve its unaccountable way of doing business. It seems SAC would rather deprive organizations of the Student Activities Fee funds that they deserve than to institute reform and dip into their reserves. If they are truly worried about student club sustainability, they ought to consider complying with these reforms.
GUSA will work to ensure that all student organizations that need funds for the upcoming year receive them. They are, after all, the students’ funds. But I do not believe that it is in the best interest of any student to fully fund this SAC if it cannot be held to the same standards of transparency and accountability as any other advisory board – or GUSA itself.
At the end of the day, the Student Activity Fee money belongs to the students. GUSA has made a good faith effort this year to listen to your voices and provide unprecedented accessibility to our proceedings. Through forums, town halls and public meetings, we have endeavored to truly be student representatives. I could not believe more firmly that these advisory board reforms are basic and necessary. I encourage any students who agree to write to SAC at sacgeorgetown.edu. Tell SAC that, after extensive student complaints, it’s time for a change.
Adam Talbot is a sophomore in the College and the speaker of the GUSA Senate.
