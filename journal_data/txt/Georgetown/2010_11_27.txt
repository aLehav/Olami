A student was approached by three unknown suspects who attempted to abduct him while he was walking near campus early last Sunday morning, according to a Public Safety Alert sent to the campus community Tuesday afternoon.
The student was walking in the vicinity of 34th and Prospect Streets around 2:15 a.m on Nov. 21, when the suspects, described as Hispanic males wearing black clothing, first tried to engage the student in conversation. One grabbed the student’s arm and began to pull him toward a black SUV parked nearby, according to the Public Safety Alert. When a Metropolitan Police Department car appeared, the suspects released the student.
No injuries were reported. This was the first attempted abduction this academic year. The Department of Public Safety was unavailable for comment.”
