The Georgetown University Student Association Constitutional Council invalidated the results of the Dec. 1 referendum on a constitutional amendment to abolish the GUSA senate and replace it with a new, elected assembly Friday evening.
The ruling states that the senate violated GUSA bylaws requiring full details of the referendum be released 14 days prior to voting.
The decision also permanently prohibits the GUSA Election Commission from releasing the results of the referendum to the public or to anyone outside the commission. The ruling can be appealed, however, and does not prohibit GUSA from holding another referendum on the same amendment.
“This failure to adhere to the timeline provided in GUSA Constitution Article VII Section 4 requires this Council’s Holding of the December 1st Constitutional Referendum Vote as invalid,” the decision reads. “The Constitutional Council hereby declares that the results of the December 1st Constitutional Referendum are null and void.”
Allegations of electioneering began Dec. 1, several hours before polls officially closed, when opponents of the referendum filed a complaint with the council regarding the referendum. The council delayed the results pending a public hearing on the complaint.
The petitioners alleged that GUSA violated its own bylaws by attempting to influence students to vote in favor of the referendum at polling stations and by failing to present the referendum to the student body in a timely manner. They cited the prominent display of “yes” campaign posters at polling stations and offers of free food in exchange for votes.
GUSA senators Jasmin Ouseph (SFS ’19), Isaac Liu (COL ’20) and Charles Hajjar (MSB ’20), GUSA Free Speech Policy Team chair D.J. Angelini (MSB ’17), GUSA Dining and Auxiliary Services Policy Team chair Mark Camilli (COL ’19) and Dylan Hughes (COL ’19), who is unaffiliated with GUSA, filed the complaint on the evening of Dec. 1. The council extended its enjoinment of the results to Dec. 5.
The council’s decision rejects much of the core of the petitioners’ argument, ruling that the GUSA bylaws prohibiting electioneering at polling stations are strictly worded to apply to elections involving candidates instead of referendums.
“I’m disappointed that the CC believed the bylaws, as currently written, did not reject electioneering in a referendum,” Camilli said. “However, I am pleased that they agreed with us and have decided that the referendum results should be invalidated, especially considering the timeline that they did not publicly release the content of the amendment within the allotted time frame.”
In a non-binding additional holding, the council suggested that the current lack of broader rules governing GUSA elections may run against the spirit of democratic norms, even though the electioneering was allowed under the bylaws as they are currently written.
“This Council submits that without the passage of a Student Bill of Rights that protects the autonomy of the polling station, as well as other fundamental voting rights, democratic norms of governance are imperiled,” the decision reads.
GUSA Election Commissioner Grady Willard (SFS ’18) said the referendum highlighted the need for clearer bylaws.
“The referendum shows the need for bylaws reform, especially as it has to do with bylaws governing referendums,” Willard said. “We look forward to working with GUSA to updating the bylaws in the coming months.”
Ouseph said she does not share the council’s view that the electioneering was allowed under the bylaws, but said she approves of the decision and intends to pursue election reform going forward.
“I’m glad that the Council invalidated the results of the election but I still personally disagree with several of the Council’s holdings regarding our perceived electioneering of the referendum,” Ouseph wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think my goals moving forward are to work on election reform so issues like this don’t occur in the future.”
GUSA Senate Speaker Richie Mullaney (COL ’18) said GUSA is now exploring possible next steps.
“We appreciate the Constitutional Council’s thorough examination of the case. We’re currently looking over their ruling in order to determine our next steps and will be able to share more information once we come to a decision,” Mullaney said. “We remain proud of our team and its efforts during the campaign and look forward to making constructive changes moving forward.”

President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration today sees a tepid welcome from both the Georgetown and greater Washington, D.C. community, with wounds still unhealed 11 weeks after the divisive presidential election.
In addition to the official inauguration events, this weekend will see several protests in response to Trump’s presidency, including the Women’s March on Washington, which is expected to feature more than 200,000 attendees Saturday.
Security measures from both local and campus security and police departments have been upgraded to prepare for about 1 million people to attend, celebrate or protest in and around the District.
Madison Thomas (COL ’19), who is the National Coordinator for College Engagement for the Women’s March, said she is expecting a turnout of 20,000 to 50,000 college students alone.
The Georgetown University College Democrats have been arranging for Georgetown students to host students from other colleges for the weekend.
GUCD Chair Meredith Forsyth (SFS ’19) said she plans to bring club members and other Georgetown students to the march, regardless of their political affiliation. GUCD is sponsoring the march.
“I really do feel like it is an inclusive event. You don’t have to be a woman to march. You don’t have to be a Democrat to march. You don’t have to necessarily be against Trump to march,” Forsyth said. “It’s really for anyone who is for women’s rights. Not only women’s rights, but for people of color, trans rights and LGBTQ+ rights.”
Thomas said the protest is not intended as a demonstration against Trump, but to rally support for women’s rights.
“We are marching on Washington. We are not marching at Donald Trump. We are marching at the United States,” Thomas said. “We are saying that women’s rights are human rights, and this is something we have noticed in recent years — that women are increasingly feeling marginalized in their communities, alienated from politics and media. And it’s not something we are willing to stand by and be silent about anymore.”
Georgetown University College Republicans President Allie Williams (SFS ’19) said the GUCR body will be demonstrating support for both Trump and equality during inauguration weekend.
“We were fortunate enough to receive tickets from the Office of Federal Relations and Institute of Politics and Public Service, so many of our members will be attending and celebrating the swearing in of our new president,” Williams said. “However, we also do have some members who will be attending the Women’s’ March to continue advocacy for equal rights, which we, of course, support.”
Forsyth said she hopes the march will act as a spark for GUCD in the future.
“It’s important for us, as GUCD, to lead people to this march, because it will kind of set the tone for us for the rest of the semester,” Forsyth said. “It sets the stage for the role we want to play on campus and in D.C. — hopefully leading the charge for advocacy and holding Trump accountable to being a president for all Americans.”
The weekend begins with a concert Thursday, followed by the inauguration Friday, the swearing-in of Trump and Pence, his inaugural address and the inaugural parade all throughout Friday.
The total inauguration costs could top $200 million based on past celebrations and estimates by officials planning the week’s events. Costs will be divided between the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a government office, the Presidential Inaugural Committee, organized by private donors and friends of the president-elect and individual federal, state and local departments.
As part of the D.C. Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management and the Georgetown University Police Department’s preparations, 28,000 personnel from three dozen state, local and federal agencies have been on duty in the District this week, according to The Washington Post. 
Molly Dunlap (SFS ’20), who plans on attending the Women’s March, said she would not let any fear of backlash stop her from attending.
“Obviously the city will be really polarized, but I really don’t think anything is going to happen at the Women’s March,” Dunlap said.
Trump’s inauguration has already spurred protests in the District. About 200 protesters marched to Vice President-elect Mike Pence’s home in Chevy Chase, Md., last night to protest against his policies toward LGBTQ communities.
Emily Paciulla (MSB ’18), who attended the protest, said it is important for the LGBTQ community and allies to demonstrate their opposition against the Trump administration.
“I think it’s very important that we have the united front considering that our vice president has a very staunch anti-LGBT history. I think it’s important that we make ourselves visible and known, and like obviously Pence wasn’t there,” Paciulla said. “I think it’s more about the message we are sending that we’re already out of the closet and we’re not going back and just kind of creating the space for people to feel welcome and unafraid of who they are.”
Metropolitan Police Department Public Affairs Specialist Aquita Brown said MPD has been coordinating with other law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety of all participators.
“We do anticipate large crowds and are aware of various groups planning on exercising their First Amendment rights,” Brown wrote in an email to The Hoya. “MPD is prepared to both protect the rights of individuals to exercise their First Amendment rights and ensure public safety.”
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, Georgetown University Police Department Chief of Police Jay Gruber and Assistant Vice President for Emergency Management Tonya Coultas sent an email informing students of rules and safety guidelines for the inauguration weekend.
Olson said students going off campus should exercise caution during a period of heightened tensions.
“I know there could be confrontations and heated exchanges around the city, throughout this weekend,” Olson wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “Just use good judgment, avoid confrontations that may involve some risk, and treat others (even those with whom you may disagree) with respect.”
Gruber said students planning to attend the Inauguration should prepare adequately. The average temperature in the District at noon is around 37 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.
“You’re probably going to be walking everywhere you go; because of the exclusion zones, Ubers, buses and taxis won’t be running to a lot of those areas. Make sure you dress appropriately for the weather and wear proper footwear,” Gruber said.
Gruber said students should limit the valuables they carry, due to an expected increase in pickpockets and petty crime.
“Other concerns we have are making sure you don’t have a lot of cash on you and making sure you only bring one credit card with you,” Gruber said.
Coultas said while she encourages students to go out and attend the weekend’s events, students must look out for their own safety.
“Just be smart. As you’re walking around, have situational awareness,” Coultas said. “Pay attention to road signs. Understand where the evacuation routes are, so if you have to evacuate for some reason, you know where you need to go.”
In the event that emergency does strike, Gruber said students can use the LiveSafe app that is free for all students to download and use.
Coultas said students should be wary of their safety on campus in addition to at the inauguration events.
“Just because you’re on campus, don’t think that there are not going to be people here, so make sure no one follows you in or out of your dorm,” Coultas said.
Given the amount of people visiting D.C. for the inauguration, Executive Director for Residential Services Patrick Killilee said students must follow the housing regulations set out by the university in order to ensure their safety.
“Anything that is university-owned, which could include university-owned townhouses — [students] cannot sublet that property,” Killilee said. “We had heard back in 2009 [for President Obama’s first Inauguration] that [The George Washington University] was having some issues with students trying to sublet their rooms.”
For students who choose to stay on campus during Friday’s events, the university is offering services for those looking for self-care, including free Counseling and Psychiatrics Services from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. today. Campus Ministry will be open all day.

As he sat in a theology class at Georgetown taught by Fr. Eugene Gallagher, S.J., a young student learned of an exorcism that occurred in the Washington area. Inspired by the incident, William Peter Blatty (CAS ’50) went on to write a novel that would serve as the foundation of an internationally renowned franchise —“The Exorcist.”
Blatty died Jan. 12 in Bethesda, Md., from multiple myeloma, passing away just five days after his 89th birthday Jan. 7.
“The Exorcist” helped raise the profile of both horror films and Georgetown. The film includes shots of Dahlgren Chapel, Healy Hall and “The Exorcist Steps,” the 97 steps located next to Car Barn where a priest is possessed to jump from a window and tumbles to his death in the film.
By the end of his career, Blatty had accrued numerous accolades for his work, including an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for “The Exorcist,” two Golden Globes for Best Screenplay for “The Exorcist” and “The Ninth Configuration” and the Horror Writers Association Lifetime Achievement Award.
“The Exorcist” is mainly set in Georgetown, and one of its most famous scenes being shot on the “Exorcist stairs” on Prospect and 36th streets.
The son of Lebanese immigrant parents, Blatty was born in New York City, N.Y., in 1928, and was raised by his mother. In a 1972 interview with The Washington Post, Blatty recounted a childhood marked by unpaid bills and frequent moves that led him to accumulate 28 different addresses.
“We never lived at the same address in New York for longer than two or three months at a time,” Blatty said. “Eviction was the order of the day.”
Blatty attended Brooklyn Preparatory, an all-male Jesuit high school in Brooklyn, N.Y., on a scholarship and graduated as valedictorian in 1946 of his class. For a while, he was uncertain as to whether he would able to afford a university education, writing “it was out of the question” in his 2015 memoir “Finding Peter.”
Blatty met Georgetown professor Neil Sullivan during a chance dinner with his mother in high school. It was this meeting that prompted Blatty’s mother to declare, “Willie, you gonna go to Georgetown!”
Encouraged by his mother, Blatty applied for and received a full-ride scholarship to the university, arriving in the fall of 1946 with only a footlocker, a briar pipe and a copy of “The Confessions of St. Augustine” in tow.
On the Hilltop, Blatty majored in English, contributed to literary journal The Georgetown Journal and performed lead roles in Mask and Bauble plays. He lived in Ryan Hall and attended mass in Dahlgren Chapel every morning, where he would later marry his fourth wife, Julie Witbrodt Blatty, in 1983.
In an October 2015 profile in the Washingtonian magazine, Blatty characterized Georgetown as both academically rigorous and an environment that cultivated close relationships with fellow classmates at Georgetown, which was an all-male school when he attended.
“It was a hard-ass school,” Blatty said. “We had a unique kind of camaraderie, and we shared a gallows humor that grows between confined men. It was wonderful.”
This humor was perhaps most prominent when Blatty led a group of Hoyas to  Villanova University two weeks before a Georgetown-Villanova football game. Disguised as a priest, Blatty stole the rival school’s mascot, an untamed wildcat.
Blatty would later recall his time at Georgetown with fondness.
“Those years at Georgetown were probably the best years of my life,” Blatty said to Washingtonian. “Until then, I’d never had a home.”
In a statement to The Hoya, University President John J. DeGioia said Blatty left a deep-rooted legacy at Georgetown and a lasting impact in the creative field.
“Our University community was deeply saddened to learn of Bill’s passing,” DeGioia wrote. “Bill’s extraordinary faith and creativity has made an enduring impact — he was a longtime friend and will be missed.”
In his acknowledgements in “The Exorcist,” Blatty thanked Georgetown professor Bernard Wagner “for teaching me to write” and the Jesuits “for teaching me to think.”
Upon graduating from Georgetown, Blatty received a master’s degree in English literature from George Washington University before working a range of jobs, including as a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman, beer truck driver and ticket agent for United Airlines. He also served as the public relations director at Loyola University of Los Angeles and the director of publicity at the University of Southern California.
In 1961, Blatty appeared as a contestant on the Groucho Marx quiz show “You Bet Your Life.” His winnings of $10,000 enabled him to quit his job and focus on writing full time.
Though considered a leading figure in the genre of theological horror, Blatty’s early beginnings as a novelist were rooted in comedy. Inspired by his time in the Psychological Warfare Division of the U.S. Air Force, Blatty authored the comedic autobiography “Which Way to Mecca, Jack?” in 1960.
However, following the publication of “The Exorcist” in 1971 — which has sold over 10 million copies worldwide to date — and the subsequent film adaptation two years later, for which he wrote the screenplay, Blatty found his status as a horror writer firmly cemented.
In a 2003 address at Georgetown hosted by the Lecture Fund, Blatty said his foray into horror was not a deliberate decision.
“Terror has never been my day job,” Blatty said. “When I was writing [‘The Exorcist’], scaring people was the furthest thing from my mind.”
Though Georgetown served as the backdrop for “The Exorcist,” Blatty’s relationship with his alma mater was not without conflict.
In October 2013, the writer spearheaded a petition calling on the Vatican to strip Georgetown of its Catholic and Jesuit identity, citing that the university did not uphold Catholic morals. The petition, which garnered over 2,000 signatures, urged Pope Francis to require that Georgetown implement Ex Corde Ecclesiae, a 1990 papal decree governing Catholic universities’ teachings in communion with the Church.
Prior to petitioning the Vatican, Blatty had filed a similar appeal with Archbishop Donald Wuerl of Washington in May 2013. The appeal was rejected.
“The exercise of the authority vested in Your Eminence … to remove the privilege of Georgetown University to represent itself as ‘Catholic’ is now required,” Blatty wrote in the petition, which was released to The Hoya by Blatty’s counsel Manuel Miranda (SFS ’82).
In April 2014, the Vatican responded to the petition, but did not pursue further action in the process of hierarchic recourse.
In 1995, Blatty was involved in the movement protesting proposed changes to Georgetown’s English department. The curricular restructuring, which was ultimately implemented in 1996, came under fire for its elimination of the requirement for English majors to study at least two of three canonical writers —Shakespeare, Chaucer and Milton.
English professor Henry Schwarz, who was present during the time of the controversy, said Blatty played an important role in the resistance to the reforms.
“Many of us who were coming had been educated with African-American, Latin American and Asian-American literature, and our teachers had encouraged us strongly to revise what we saw as a very old-fashioned and exclusive, divisive kind of curriculum,” Schwarz said. “Mr. Blatty was a strong opponent of that.”
Following his death, Blatty was commemorated for his wide-ranging accomplishments in horror fiction.
“RIP William Peter Blatty, who wrote the great horror novel of our time,” author Stephen King tweeted Jan. 13. “So long, Old Bill.”
Actress Linda Blair, who played the character of Regan MacNeil in the first “Exorcist” film, paid tribute to Blatty in an interview with KFI AM 640 in Los Angeles.
“This is really about how special Bill Blatty was because he was intense when I was young. I was a little nervous around him, but when I got to know him later in life he was a teddy bear, he would laugh, and he was funny, and he was interesting and he was special that’s what I think the world doesn’t know about him,” Blair said.
Blatty is survived by his wife, six children, seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. The 2006 death of his son Peter at age 19 inspired Blatty to write a memoir, “Finding Peter,” in 2015.
“Death is not a separation,” Blatty wrote in the book. “When our loved one dies, they do not leave us. They remain. They do not go to some distant place. They simply begin their eternity.”

President Donald Trump’s term will consist of four years of policy conflicting with Republicans and Democrats alike, including the renegotiation of free trade agreements, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the building of a border wall, according to Georgetown professors interviewed by The Hoya.
Government professor Michele Swers, whose research focuses on Congress and the role of women in politics, said Trump is poised to clash with Republican leadership in Congress on his stated positions on trade, which contradict typical free trade-oriented Republican policies.
Trump pledged throughout his campaign to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement — a trade deal ratified in 1994 between the United States, Canada and Mexico — and to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement including 12 Pacific Rim countries, the United States and Canada.
“In the past, Republicans have been the more free trade party. [Speaker of the House] Paul Ryan [R-Wis.] has already stated that he’s opposed to placing additional tariffs on our country,” Swers said. “He’s very much a supporter of free trade and trade deals. And so there is going to be some conflict between Trump and some of the free trade Republicans in the House over plans that he has, and I think that he’ll have a difficult time getting tariffs, additional sort of taxes.”
In an interview with The Hoya, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs at the McCourt School of Public Policy Mark Rom, whose research focuses on social welfare policy, said Republicans in Congress may also be skeptical of Trump’s campaign proposal to guarantee six paid weeks of maternity leave for new mothers.
“This is not a typical Republican proposal. This is typically a Democratic proposal. This is a big thing for the Republicans,” Rom said. “I don’t think Congress wants to give him that. Congress doesn’t want to create a national policy of paid maternity child leave.”
However, Rom said he doubts maternity leave is one of Trump’s highest priorities, saying the proposal was primarily inspired by his daughter Ivanka, not Trump himself.
“Mainly it’s coming through Ivanka’s mouth,” Rom said of the policy. “She’s important, so I think it’s probably on his list of things to do, but probably not at the top of the list.”
On health care policy, Rom said the Republican Congress and Trump are unified in their resolve to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He said that the lack of a replacement plan from the Trump transition team leaves an open question.
“He keeps saying he has a plan and that plan will be revealed soon, but in fact, that plan has not been revealed,” Rom said. “It’s a concept, and the concept is everybody will be covered, it will be great, it won’t cost very much and everybody will have great care. That’s not a plan. That’s nirvana. Until he tells us exactly how he plans to attain nirvana, then we don’t know what he’s really going to do.”
A Congressional Budget Office report released Tuesday said 18 million Americans could lose health insurance if certain parts of the Affordable Care Act, which subsidizes insurance for many Americans, were to be repealed without a replacement.
Dean of Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies Patricia Ann Cloonan said she hopes the benefits of the ACA will continue, regardless of the Republican Congress.
“The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage for millions of people and emphasized the importance of health care providers collaborating with the communities they serve in the delivery of care. More insured individuals and more community engagement are two very good things that I hope will continue,” Cloonan said.
Trump made increasing restrictions on immigration a focal point of his campaign. He called for a full ban on Muslim immigration in December 2015, before beginning to walk back the policy in May 2016. Swers said she expects Trump’s pick for Attorney General Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to help implement a hardline stance on immigration.
“Trump has made immigration a priority issue that he’s talked about a lot,” Swers said. “By appointing Jeff Sessions, who’s also very hard-line on immigration, very law and order, I would expect that they’re going to go after things like sanctuary cities, look to step up deportations. We know that they’re already looking as a way to build his border wall, so that they’ll be focused on those things.”
Swers added that the long-promised border wall between the United States and Mexico looks likely and may not even require any new Congressional action to be built. However, she said it would likely be paid for by U.S. tax dollars first, which contradicts with Trump’s frequent campaign promises that Mexico would pay for the wall. Trump said Jan. 6 that he would ask Congress to pay for the wall, with Mexico paying back the United States at a later date.
Building the wall could cost up to $25 billion, according to The Washington Post. “Right now they’re saying that they’re going to use legislation that had already been passed in previous Congresses related to border security, and then you’re just looking to get funding for the appropriations process,” Swers said. “So that means that we would be paying for it and not Mexico right now.”
Associate government professor Matthew Kroenig, who specializes in international relations and was a foreign policy advisor for former Republican Presidential Candidate Marco Rubio (R-Fl.),  said Trump will take an aggressive foreign policy approach to China, contrasting that of outgoing President Barack Obama. Obama’s foreign policy has been marked by a focus on Asia, including the negotiation of the TPP and the United States’ participation in the regional East Asia Summit.
“Trump has indicated that he plans a tougher approach to China, look[s] to strengthen relations with Taiwan and promise[s] to push back against China’s illegal island building campaign in the South China Sea,” Kroenig wrote in an email to The Hoya. “A move in this direction would be welcome as the Obama administration’s soft approach has allowed Beijing to use coercion to take contested territory from U.S. treaty allies and challenge the rules-based order in Asia.”
Kroenig also said he expects Trump to pursue a friendlier relationship with Russia, but added that this relationship should not preclude holding Russia accountable for the nation’s apparent interference in the presidential election. The Office of the Director on National Intelligence released a report Jan. 6 detailing a Russian campaign to influence the United States election in Trump’s favor.
“Improved relations with Russia is a priority for Trump,” Kroenig said. “There is no doubt that a better relationship with Russia is desirable, but we must also be clear-eyed about the threat Moscow poses and realize that much of the blame for the recent downturn in relations falls squarely on [Vladimir] Putin’s shoulders.”

January 20, 2017 by Christian Paz 1 Comment 
Concerns over limitations of academic freedom in American universities in the Middle East have surfaced following the rejection of a School of Foreign Service graduate student’s request to research migrant labor issues in the Persian Gulf region.
Bogos said she was detained for five hours during her first arrival to Qatar in June 2016 and subsequently detained on two separate occasions – for one hour and seven hours – upon returning to Qatar from trips to South Korea and Greece to renew her travel visa.
During her first detention, Bogos said security officials told her that her name was on a Gulf Cooperation Council blacklist for “security-related reasons.” She then contacted the State Department through the U.S. Embassy.
“I was told by a GU-Q administrator that my visa rejection was because I am on a blacklist and that the Qatari state could not override the blacklist,” Bogos said in an interview with The Hoya.
According to Bogos, the blacklist the immigration official referred to belongs to the intelligence communities of the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which both Qatar and the UAE members.
Bogos wrote critically of NYU’s treatment of workers involved in the construction of its Abu Dhabi campus after studying abroad in the UAE as an undergraduate student at NYU.
The university maintains that Middle Eastern countries have a right to express their sovereignty through their immigration policies.
Bogos said her case shared similarities with that of NYU academic Andrew Ross, who like Bogos studies migrant labor rights and was denied permission to board an airplane bound for Abu Dhabi in 2015.
Ross was subject to surveillance from a private investigator and is still barred from traveling to the UAE. His ban prompted the American Association of University Professors to publically condemn NYU and the UAE.
The Middle East Studies Association President Beth Baron and MESA Executive Director Amy Newhall responded similarly to Bogos’ situation with condemnations of the Qatari and Emirati governments and have called for Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia and NYU President Andrew Hamilton to condemn Bogos’ treatment.
“We further call on both of you to denounce the hacking of private e-mails belonging to members of the academic community, as well as the compilation by the UAE, Qatar and, presumably, other GCC member states of blacklists of students and scholars who are to be denied entry for political reasons,” Baron and Newhall wrote in an open letter sent to DeGioia and Hamilton.
MESA Chair of the Committee on Academic Freedom Laurie Brand wrote in an email to The Hoya that the organization has not received a response from either university. DeGioia’s office did not respond to request for comment as of press time.
Bogos said though she has not been contacted by either NYU or Georgetown, she had seen Beckman’s comments on Inside Higher Ed.
“NYU has not said anything either,” Bogos said. “But the Inside Higher Ed piece has their statements and I wasn’t surprised to see that that was the line they were taking.”
Hellman said this case is reflective of the U.S. State Department’s own policy and tendency to reject a far greater number of student visa request from foreign countries, including Qatar and other Middle East countries.
“Generally when visas are denied, there is no reason provided. The United States isn’t obligated to provide reasons as to why a visa was denied. Qatar isn’t obligated to provide reasons as to why a visa was denied,” Hellman said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is something that they don’t give up by having a relationship with the university.”
Bogos said she understands Qatar has a right as a sovereign nation to exercise its own immigration policy but believes this right can conflict with the values of free expression and academic freedom that define a university.
“If you are going to open up a campus in Qatar, for instance, like Georgetown did, you should be able to say the same academic freedom principles that are being upheld in D.C. should be upheld there, meaning that the university should be able to secure the free movement of both students and faculty between campuses,” Bogos said.
Hellman also noted immigration policy is a sovereign right and Qatar has the discretion to adjudicate regardless of external influence.
“The relationship of academic freedom does not necessarily entail a reduction in sovereignty of a country’s borders. That applies not only to Qatar but to all countries that have universities in them,” Hellman said.
Rachel Pugh, senior director for strategic communications at Georgetown, said Georgetown regrets Bogos’ experience but accepts the authority of sovereign nations to determine immigration policy.
“Last summer, the School of Foreign Service in Qatar welcomed master’s candidate Kristina Bogos to campus as part of her studies and supported her research, as they would any scholar. Georgetown continues to support Kristina in her studies and research,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Hellman said that he communicated with Bogos regarding her visa denial, and noted that although he is concerned by Bogos’ experience, the incident is not representative of a larger issue with academic freedom.
“There’s no consistent restriction that we’ve seen on our faculty,” Hellman said.  “It doesn’t mean that we’re not concerned about her case.”
Hellman cited the academic work conducted by other students and faculty in Qatar as evidence of the absence of any kind of external pressure or resistance.
“Our faculty and students in Qatar routinely work in very sensitive areas, and they haven’t faced any kind of resistance as far as we know,” Hellman said. “We haven’t necessarily seen some kind of blanket restriction on the freedom to deal with these politically sensitive issues, including the migrant labor issues.”
Bogos said she requested that Hellman and SFS-Q Dean James Reardon-Anderson raise her visa case with Qatari officials to determine if they might re-evaluate her case. According to Hellman, he has not received a response from Qatari authorities.
Reardon-Anderson said he is unable to comment on Bogos’ case.
“I and other members of the SFS-Q staff supported her request to enroll as a student in SFS-Q and to gain access to student housing and other facilities,” Reardon-Anderson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I would describe our relationship as positive on both sides.”
Bogos said she plans to continue to press her case with the Georgetown Task Force on Academic Freedom in a Global Context and with both Hellman and Reardon-Anderson, but said she believes there could be more cases of academics involved in research being denied student visas.
When she raised concerns with Georgetown administrators last year, she was told “access to study and residence visas varies across individuals and over time,” which Bogos said could imply prior student or faculty visa denials or travel bans.
Hellman emphasized that the campus in Qatar reflects Georgetown’s commitment to foreign service.
“It’s also critical that we have a strong partner, and we do have a strong partner in the Qatar Foundation who shares our values,” Hellman said. “We share a commitment to building a campus that educates a generation of students.”
Regardless, Bogos remains critical of the presence of Western universities in regions that may offer resistance to critical research.
“NYU Abu Dhabi and Georgetown Qatar, they’re both funded by the government. So, to accept that money and then to sit back and not fight to support your students, then what are you doing? Why are you over there?” Bogos said. “The message I feel now is that they’re only there for the money and just to elevate the university on the international stage, rather than actually ensuring that they’re doing what a university is doing in the first place.”

Undergraduate tuition rates for the 2017-2018 academic year will rise from $49,968 to $51,720, a 3.5 percent increase over the previous year, according to a campuswide email sent by University Provost Robert Groves yesterday.
The increase comes after a strong student reaction to previous hikes, including the creation of protest group Hoyas Against the Hike in September.
Groves said tuition increases were necessary to meet the university’s funding demands.
“In setting tuition rates, we must balance the competing needs of academic programs, students, faculty, staff, facilities and infrastructure,” Groves said. “We are actively working to minimize tuition increases, and we maintain our deep commitment to attracting the brightest students regardless of their financial circumstances.”
Along with the tuition charge increase, Groves wrote, the university will implement modest increases to room and board charges.
The university has increased tuition every year since 2012. In recent years, the rate of increase has slowed: this year’s 3.5 percent hike follows a 4 percent increase in 2016 and a 4.3 percent increase in 2015. The hike also undercuts earlier university expectations of a steady four percent annual increase through 2020.
Tuition has increased 22 percent from the 2012-2013 academic year to the 2017-2018 academic year.
Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said this year’s hike may be unpopular, but are necessary and minimal.
“Realistically speaking, no one wants to see their tuition go up. That being said, understanding our financial strains — especially with our need for renovations, for example — increases in staff, things that the student body would tangibly benefit from with an increase,” Khan said. “I think, based on engagement with Provost Groves, that he was committed to keeping tuition as low as possible. The university seems to be on the same page as students.”
After last year’s hike, Khan and GUSA Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) wrote an article for The Hoya in August 2016 criticizing the administration for a “lack of transparency” in approving the rate increase “without the consultation of any students.” They also called for administrators to “address the ongoing trend of tuition hikes” in a town hall with students.
In response to the article and significant student opposition, administrators participated in a Hoya Roundtable discussion hosted by GUSA in November.
Groves told students at the event that tuition hikes were a necessary response to the university’s funding requirements. He pointed to Georgetown’s relatively small endowment as contributing to the university’s reliance on tuition funds. Georgetown’s $1.5 billion endowment is smaller than other top-ranked universities — Notre Dame has a $10.4 billion endowment, while Duke has an endowment of around $7.3 billion.
Groves also highlighted student-focused uses of tuition funds, including construction projects and improvement to residential buildings.
Khan said Groves’ email shows a positive step by the university towards increasing transparency around tuition increases.
“This is something that’s a big win for students to finally see some transparency,” Khan said. “That’s been a really big frustration. I think the university has been more willing to engage thanks to student activism and advocacy on this. At least from the GUSA end, we’ve been working really hard on this, so it’s just great to see an outcome.”

Passing by a vote of nine to four on Dec. 20, the Washington, D.C. Council approved a new payroll tax to fund an expansive family and medical leave benefits plan for the city’s private sector employees.
If the bill is signed by Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), it moves to Congress for review.
The Universal Paid Leave Amendment Act of 2016 ensures paid leave of eight weeks to parents of newborns, six weeks to workers tending to an ill relative and two paid weeks in sick time.
The council’s approval of the bill imposes a new 0.62 percent payroll tax on all District employers. The tax is expected to create $250 million annually, which will be allocated by the mayor’s office.
Councilmembers David Grosso (I-At Large) and Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) co-sponsored the bill. Grosso said he expects the bill to help the entire community, regardless of concerns from across the aisle. Grosso also said the bill’s passage marks a major success for the District’s progressive lawmakers.
“I think it’s going to be beneficial mostly for the entire city,” Grosso said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is a challenge, but I think people will come to realize that when workers get to come home to care for their loved ones, it’s better for business, it’s better for the workers and ultimately it’s better for the entire community.”
D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), who championed the bill, explained its significance at a council meeting in November.
“This bill will be the most generous in the nation by providing eight weeks paid leave for family care such as a sick child or parent, and 11 weeks paid parental leave such as for bonding with a newborn child,” Mendelson said.
The benefits established by the bill do not extend to federal and District employees as the city cannot tax federal workers and city workers already benefit from a paid leave program. According to a statement from Mendelson’s office, the payroll tax will go into effect in January 2019, and the benefits will be available in January 2020.
Bowser took issue with an earlier version of the bill and claimed she would not sign it into law. However, after the bill went through amendments including reducing the amount of leave time from 16 weeks to 14 weeks, Bowser said she would consider it.
Bowser’s office did not respond to a request for comment as of 2:30 a.m.
Grosso said he believes Bowser disputed the original version because of the way it was funded.
“She didn’t like the way we were paying for this legislation, and frankly she didn’t come up with a great alternative,” Grosso said of Bowser’s initial reaction. “I am convinced that she and the others who have disagreed with this approach agree that it’s important to give paid leave.”
However, Grosso said the bill could ultimately help small businesses as well, creating a healthier workforce in the long term.
“It will also have a benefit to the businesses directly,” Grosso said. “They will have a stronger workforce. They will have a broader base to recruit from for their workers. And they won’t have to train somebody when somebody has to go out for a couple days to care for someone.”
Many business leaders in the District have stated opposition to the bill, stating they previously offered various forms of family and sick leave to their employees, but object to the tax increase that comes with this bill.
Greater Washington Board of Trade President and CEO Jim Dinegar said the board is not opposed to paid family and medical leave, but they have concerns over its funding.
“We worked hard to develop a workable, affordable and appropriate paid family leave approach,” Dinegar said. “We have been vocal proponents of paid leave and represent countless businesses that provide even more leave than called for in this legislation, which is why we were disappointed to be charged a tax to provide benefits our members already provide, often at far better levels.”
However, Mendelson expressed his belief that the bill will bring workers to D.C.
“Most businesses see benefits as a means to attract and retain workers. Looked at from this perspective, the bill makes the District a more attractive place for workers, and therefore becomes a benefit to District employers,” Mendelson said.

Executive Director of the immigrant resource organization Central American Resource Center Abel Núñez received the John Thompson Jr. Legacy of a Dream Award at the 15th annual “Let Freedom Ring Celebration” at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Monday.
The John Thompson Jr. Legacy of a Dream Award, named for the Georgetown men’s basketball coach from 1972-1999, is given each year at the event to honor an individual whose work furthers Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy of social justice and tolerance.
The “Let Freedom Ring Celebration” is one of 18 events the university will host this year to honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. Georgetown will also confer an honorary degree on Lonnie Bunch III, the founding director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture as part of the series.
The event featured performances from Grammy Award-winning singer Gladys Knight, the “Let Freedom Ring Celebration” Choir featuring Georgetown students and community members, the Georgetown Black Theatre Ensemble and the spoken word group Corpus Collective.
Knight sang hits such as “Midnight Train to Georgia,” several hymns and modern pieces such as Sam Smith’s “Stay with Me.”
Knight, whose family knew King when she was growing up in Atlanta, said King’s work had a profound impact on her life.
“Throughout my life, I walked with Dr. King, I supported him in his rallies, I’ve sung for him many times,” Knight said. “I think about his speech, ‘I Have a Dream,’ and to me, there was resolve in that speech. To me, he was ready, he was ready for the challenge.”
CARECEN provides a range of support services to the Latino community in the District, including citizenship courses and legal aid to recent immigrants. According to the CARECEN website, the organization has served over 87,000 Latino residents since 1981.
University President John J. DeGioia said Núñez’s work represented a contribution to a larger struggle for justice.
“In our nation and in our world, there are many great challenges and many persistent injustices that summon us to action, to answer the calling, to respond with hope, to engage with solidarity. Let us heed Dr. King’s call,” DeGioia said. “Tonight, we honor an individual who has dedicated himself to this beautiful struggle.”
DeGioia also remembered the 272 black slaves who, in 1838, were sold to a Louisiana plantation to benefit Georgetown University. All known descendants of the 272 were invited to the event.
“This year, as you have heard already tonight, we place a special recognition on our community’s efforts to reflect on our own past and the importance of remembrance,” DeGioia said.
Núñez said his primary inspiration to work in the Latino community came from his childhood.
As the first person in his family to learn English, he often found himself helping his parents and neighbors with tasks that required English-language skills. This experience showed him that connecting underserved communities to resources can be an important tool in aiding these populations.
“I want to make sure that the development that occurs in this city lifts all boats. You know, I see an incredible wealth and the incredible amenities that exist and not everyone has a chance to utilize them,” Núñez said. “What I want to be able to see, if I’m lucky enough to look back on my body of work, is a work that brought to people. I want to look back and see work that impacted a community and then took appropriate action to make that change, but it was systemic.”
Lauren Finkenthal (COL ’19), who performed in the choir, said she enjoyed working with the other choir members to honor King’s work.
“The community members were also fantastic. They completely anchored the entire group,” Finkenthal said. “It’s really great, and also, of course, it was for an amazing cause that I think we all feel really strong about.”
Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) said he appreciated Georgetown’s dedication to honoring the work of so many influential leaders in the District and across the nation.
“Gladys Knight’s performance was unreal. The work that Abel Núñez does in unreal, and so it’s a pretty spectacular combo as part of a really spectacular event that I’m really proud to say that Georgetown hosts every year,” Goldstein said. “It’s awesome that we get to do this.”

Washington, D.C., finished 2016 with the highest rate of homelessness of any U.S. metropolitan area with 124 out of every 10,000 residents experiencing homelessness, according to a Dec. 14 report from the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
The Hunger and Homelessness survey used data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as well as the National Alliance to End Homelessness to analyze both homelessness rates and homelessness growth since 2009 in the nation’s 32 largest metropolitan areas.
The District also saw one of the most significant increases in homelessness between 2009 and 2016, ranking fourth in the nation with a 34.1 percent gain, trailing only behind New York City, Wichita, Kan., and Honolulu, Hawaii.
Samantha Batko, director of the Homelessness Research Institute at the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said a lack of affordable housing was the main contributor to homelessness rates both in the District and across the county.
“The District, like many other cities included in the survey report, faces the challenge of affordable housing,” Batko wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While the report shows that many of the cities are able to reduce homelessness, the national lack of affordable housing is likely to have a chilling effect on their efforts over the coming years.”
However, District Interagency Council on Homelessness Policy Advisor Theresa Silla said D.C.’s high rates of homelessness and homelessness growth are due to the area’s right-to-shelter laws implemented in 2015, which expand access to homeless services year round instead of only during hypothermia season, which is between Nov. 1 and March 31.
Due to this year-round law, Silla said resources for the homeless are used at a quicker rate by the Department of Human Services, as they are providing services for an additional seven months per year.
“These right-to-shelter laws are something that’s really distinct from a lot of other communities in the nation,” Silla said. “So, factors like affordable housing and other resources can play into these rates, but this to us explains why something or other is happening.”
The report did highlight some successful programs the District has implemented in addressing homelessness.
For example, author Eugene Lowe, USCOM assistant executive director, praised the District’s Capital Area Food Bank for its online social search engine, which connects area residents with free and reduced-price food services.
“[It is| unique among search engines in that it is designed to make human services information accessible so that people can find the help that they need easily, quickly, and anonymously,” Lowe wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Silla said the District Interagency Council on Homelessness was pleased to see that these programs garnered notice and their success indicates D.C. is on the right track on helping individuals affected by homelessness.
“We’ve put in a lot of work to really look at our system and how we’re working to connect people who are experiencing homelessness in the area to permanent housing and resources so that they can end their experience with homelessness,” Silla said. “We want to show that ending homelessness is possible, it is a reality.”
D.C. Coalition for the Homeless Executive Director Michael Ferrell said a more comprehensive look at factors contributing to homelessness is necessary to lowering area rates, especially because of the effect of right-to-shelter laws.
“When you just look at the numbers without any further explanation, the numbers are what they are,” Ferrell said. “They certainly show an increase in the District’s homeless population last year compared to the year before, but understanding what those numbers represent is critically important. We’ve made a lot of progress in the last year, even if an initial look doesn’t tell you that.”
Georgetown University Homeless Outreach Programs and Education member Mandy Brouillard (NHS ’18) said these numbers show a profound need for more homelessness efforts.
“It’s a little bit ironic almost because I think people associate the capital with a place where everyone can fulfill the American Dream, but what we see is really different from that,” Brouillard said. “There’s a lot of poverty here and a lot of inequality and I think that translates into higher rates of homelessness.”
Christian Collier (COL ’19), who has worked with homeless initiatives in New York City such as the Saint Francis Xavier Food Pantry, said the numbers could serve as a call to action for area officials.
“It’s definitely a sign that the city needs to work on fixing this and working to provide more jobs are more opportunities for these homelessness individuals,” Collier said. “However, I think this is a sign to officials that they need to improve and hopefully they will.”

Three Georgetown students were among the 40 Marshall Scholars chosen this year, with Seamus Caragher (COL ’16), Devika Ranjan (SFS ’17) and Erika Raven (GRD ’17) earning the fellowship to spend two years studying in the United Kingdom while pursuing a postdoctoral research topic of their choice.
The three follow in the footsteps of Matthew Quallen (SFS ’16), who was Georgetown’s 11th Marshall Scholar.
Caragher studied neurobiology before graduating from Georgetown last year. Now a 22-year-old research technologist at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, Caragher said he plans to use his scholarship for a one-year master’s degree in cancer sciences at the University of Glasgow, followed by a one-year master’s degree in technology policy at the University of Cambridge.
After studying abroad, Caragher said he wants to pursue a medical degree and hopes for a residency in neurosurgery or neuro-oncology.
“I want to blend translational research and clinical practice,” Caragher said in a statement on the Georgetown website. “To successfully serve as a clinician, I must have deep connections to research. In order to meaningfully contribute to patient-focused research, I need to confront cancer each day.
Ranjan, who is set to graduate from Georgetown with a degree in culture and politics this spring, aims to pursue a master’s degree in refugee and forced migration at the University of Oxford for a year and a second one-year master’s degree in devised theater at the university.
Ranjan said the Marshall Scholarship was a unique fellowship opportunity.
“I loved that I could combine my interest in refugee advocacy with formal theatre training — the Marshall supports this interdisciplinary creativity,” Ranjan said.
Through her studies, Ranjan said she has found similarities between theater and politics, which she hopes to explore further with this scholarship.
“Theater and politics are both based on performance. On the political side, each diplomatic interaction and event is inherently theatrical — we are performing and representing the essence of our country to the rest of the world,” Ranjan said in an interview with The Hoya. “Performance is an entertaining, organic, grassroots way of teaching us about the world around us. Theater is unique because of its physicality.”
University President John. J. DeGioia said in a university press release that Ranjan’s work addressing refugee issues through theatre exemplifies the spirit of Georgetown.
“Devika’s extraordinary efforts to engage marginalized communities through performance reflect our University’s most deeply-held values,” DeGioia said. “We are so proud that Devika has won the Marshall.”
Raven, this year’s third Marshall Scholar, is a Ph.D. candidate in Georgetown’s Interdisciplinary Program for Neuroscience.
With the scholarship, Raven plans to continue her research on the long term behavioral and cognitive effects of iron deficiency at the Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre.
Ultimately, Raven’s research aims to provide a more specific and sensitive way to track developmental change and facilitate diagnosis.
In the university press release, William Rebeck, a professor of neuroscience, said that Raven deserves the scholarship given the research she has done so far.
“Erika’s selection as a Marshall Sherfield Fellow ensures the continuation of her important research on brain development and her dedicated efforts to share the sciences more widely,” DeGioia said with regard to Raven. “We look forward to following the development of her work in the time ahead.”
