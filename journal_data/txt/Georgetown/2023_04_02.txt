Georgetown University’s board of directors approved in February 2023 a new undergraduate degree program offered jointly between the McCourt School of Public Policy and the College of Arts & Sciences starting in the Fall 2023 semester.
The program requires students to spend their first two years on the main Georgetown campus and the next two years on the downtown campus, which will eventually feature a new McCourt School building in close proximity to the U.S. Capitol Building. Students in the program will also participate in a mandatory internship program for one semester as part of an effort to promote experiential learning.
Sarah Whitehouse (CAS ’26), a member of the student strategy team for the McCourt School, said the degree represents a common intersection of the interests of Georgetown students.
“I think the new undergraduate degree is great because it offers a course of study that combines the interests of many students,” Whitehouse wrote to The Hoya. .
While Georgetown policy does not currently allow School of Foreign Service (SFS) students to graduate with two majors, Whitehouse said she thought changing this requirement might benefit students instead of having them commit entirely to the McCourt School.
“I think a better option may be allowing for easier/more dual majors between the College and SFS,” Whitehouse wrote. 
Currently, undergraduates cannot earn a degree in public policy, as the McCourt School currently only offers graduate degrees like the Master of Public Policy and the Master of Science in Data Science for Public Policy. Students in the new program can focus on public policy as a whole or choose a concentration, such as climate change and the environment, domestic and social policy and political institutions, energy and international development, according to a Georgetown University press release. 
In addition to the new degree, the newly constructed downtown site of the McCourt School will welcome students near the heart of Capitol Hill starting in the summer of 2024. The new building will provide an opportunity for students, researchers and faculty to come together in one unified space for the first time since the school’s founding in 2013.
“Our new building will unite McCourt School students, faculty, research centers and staff in the same location for the first time since the School’s founding in 2013, accelerating collaboration and spurring new partnerships,” a press release from the McCourt School reads. 
Jonathan Ladd, an associate professor in the government department and the McCourt School, said the new degree program provides unique opportunities for students.
“I think that it is a great opportunity for students,” Ladd wrote to The Hoya. “Georgetown students are very interested in the whole cluster of subjects related to the social sciences and policy-making.”
Ladd said he will teach the required undergraduate class titled “The Politics of Policymaking” in the McCourt School starting in the Fall semester of 2024. Ladd said the public policy degree is integral for Georgetown students hoping to explore the intersection of business, international relations and government in a single major. 
“The public policy degree will essentially be an interdisciplinary degree that will allow students to take classes in all of those topics with a focus on government policy-making,” Ladd wrote.

Hoyas for Human Rights (HfHR), a Georgetown student organization facilitating discussions on international humanitarian issues, will host its inaugural Human Rights Summit March 31, partnering with several on-campus clubs and associations to raise awareness for global human rights, from worker’s rights to extrajudicial punishment. 
HfHR collaborated with Lauinger Library, the Cawley Career Education Center, the John Main Center, student publications including The Hoya and The Georgetown Voice and a diverse group of clubs to hold 18 events across campus. During the summit, students will be able to discuss human rights careers in the Cawley Career Center, attend a group mediation or hear from a panel on environmental racism.
The planning process for the summit prioritized partnerships with other activist student organizations and integrating human rights into an across-campus event, rather than bringing in speakers for one central event, according to HfHR co-founder Gwyneth Murphy (SFS ’23, GRD ’24).
“Partnerships for the summit were so critical because there’s already work being done across all kinds of human rights areas on campus; it’s just not labeled that way,” Murphy said. “We wanted to just bring together the people that are already doing that work and highlight the great things that they’re already doing.”
The summit will involve representatives from 12 student clubs, two student publications, five university-run student centers and Lauinger Library.  
Murphy said HfHR organizers were surprised by partner clubs’ enthusiasm about participating in the summit.
“We’ve just been overwhelmed by the amount of support that we’ve had and the number of organizations that want to participate, especially for a brand new organization,” Murphy said. “I could see that this felt like an exciting opportunity to them as much as it felt like an exciting opportunity to us.”
Riley Swain (SFS ’25), HfHR’s head of LGBTQ+ issues and gender-based violence, said the summit aims to showcase each participating organization’s contribution to on-campus conversations on human rights.
“Our partnership organizations each contribute a unique perspective on a multitude of human rights issues as well as how to get involved with them, so the summit presents a rare opportunity for these perspectives to be brought together,” Swain wrote to The Hoya. 
The summit will provide an accessible way for students to learn about human rights, Rebecca Cohn (CAS ’25), HfHR’s head of reproductive justice issues.
“Regardless of your interests, every person on campus probably cares about at least one human rights issue, and I think the Summit provides an entrypoint for students into human rights work through already established commitments or interests,” Cohn wrote to The Hoya. 
Murphy and Melissa Deng (SFS ’23) founded HfHR last summer, as Murphy said they felt Georgetown needed a student organization that could voice support for human rights and uplift the work of existing clubs in the space.
“It shocked me that we didn’t have any human rights organization at Georgetown up to this point,” Murphy told The Hoya. “We’re a very socially minded institution, with social organizations, and people deal with human rights, but there’s never been an explicit human rights organization.”
Deng said the club’s primary mission is to support existing advocacy efforts at Georgetown and spotlight human rights worldwide.
“We exist to build off the existing human rights work that is already being done on campus,” Deng said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’re mostly a coalition builder. So our mission revolves around creating this inclusive space for meaningful discussion and mobilization around human rights issues, both on campus and around the world.”
The HfHR leadership also hopes to use the summit as an opportunity to bring attention to the absence of dialogue on human rights on campus prior to the club’s founding, according to Deng. 
“Our biggest hope is just to get more people involved in human rights discourse more broadly and then also to get our name out and show that this absence of a human rights summit, the fact that there was no Hoyas for Human Rights before this year, is definitely indicative of a pattern that we need to change,” Deng said.

Georgetown University has officially opened the Yarrow Mamout Masjid — the first mosque on a U.S. university campus with a spirituality and formation hall, halal kitchen and ablution stations.
Located in the Village C West dormitory, the masjid first opened unfinished in fall 2019 as a space for Muslim students to pray and reflect before construction on the mosque finished earlier this year. The masjid is named for Yarrow Mamout, a former slave who practiced Islam throughout his life and settled in the Georgetown neighborhood after buying his freedom in 1796.
Students, local Muslim leaders, professors and diplomats from Turkey, Qatar and Indonesia attended the March 18 opening ceremony, which came seven years after planning began.
“The construction of the Yarrow Mamout Masjid has been a long-awaited moment for the entire Muslim community at Georgetown, as it provides a visible and tangible expression of the community’s presence and contributions on campus,” Aleena Dawer (SOH ’24), the director of spirituality and service of Georgetown’s Muslim Students Association (MSA), wrote to The Hoya.
“The mosque represents a space for Muslim students, faculty, and staff to come together in prayer, community, and celebration, and it serves as a powerful reminder of the strength and resilience of the Muslim community in the face of challenges and adversity,” Dawer added.
Dawer said the mosque provides her with a place to meet and build friendships with other Muslims from varying backgrounds and to find belonging, support and peace on campus.
“As a Muslim, the Yarrow Mamout Masjid is a sanctuary for me, a place where I can find solace and peace amidst the chaos of the world. It’s a place where I can connect with my faith, reflect on my life, and seek guidance,” Dawer wrote. “It’s a place that inspires me to be a better person, to strive for excellence in all aspects of my life, and to live according to the principles of Islam which include justice, respect, and peace.”
Nile Adhami (CAS ’25), the MSA’s director of programming and its incoming president, said the masjid is a safe space for him to practice his faith, relax and study.
“The new Yarrow Mamout Masjid means everything to me — as a Muslim, it can be difficult to find a home on campus,” Adhami wrote to The Hoya. “It’s a place where I can feel comfortable to be myself, and engage my Islamic faith to the fullest. In a Catholic Jesuit University, that’s a big deal.”
Adhami said the MSA plans to host several community building events, including talks with visiting scholars and Imams, in the newly completed masjid, especially in light of growing global hostility against the Islamic faith.
“The Masjid is an incredible space for hosting community building events, religious talks, and spiritual programming,” Adhami wrote. “In a world where Muslims so often are marginalized, scape-goated, and oppressed, the Yarrow Mamout Masjid is a place where we can proudly assert our presence as Muslims in America.” 
Ammar Hussain (SFS ’24), the MSA’s vice president, echoed Adhami’s sentiments on the community-building potential of the mosque.
“When we built this Masjid at Georgetown, we didn’t just build walls and doors. We built a community — a community in which Muslims from all backgrounds can come together to practice our religion, grow in our faith and spirituality, and form familial connections with other Muslims on campus. A building doesn’t determine community, but what it does do is provide Muslims like me a space on campus where we can freely be ourselves,” Hussain wrote to The Hoya.
Islamophobia, prejudice against Muslims and the religion of Islam, has been on the rise. Over 60% of Muslims in America report being the target of religious discrimination. Anti-Muslim hatred has also become an increasingly global phenomenon in recent years.
Dawer said she hopes non-Muslim students will be able to use the new masjid as an opportunity to engage in interfaith dialogue and learn more about Islam and its customs. 
“To me, interfaith dialogue is about more than just learning about different religions or beliefs — it’s about cultivating a deep sense of empathy and compassion for others, and recognizing the fundamental interconnectedness of all human beings,” Dawer wrote.
“By engaging in interfaith dialogue, we can break down stereotypes and misconceptions and build bridges of understanding,” Dawer added.
