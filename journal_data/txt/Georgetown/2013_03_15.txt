In their 2012 campaign, GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) prioritized social justice, diversity, student space and academic life. One year later, as the pair leaves office, their accomplishments have in some cases surpassed the promises they made in their campaign, despite some setbacks.
 
Diversity
Upon taking office, Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount brought two historic moments to Georgetown: the first all-female executive ticket and record-high turnout for any Georgetown University Student Association election. They then began fulfilling their promise to increase diversity within the student government.
In assembling their executive branch, the pair chose 11 women and 13 men — marking a shift toward diversity when compared with the cabinet of their predecessors Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Greg Laverriere (COL ’12), which included four women and 22 men.
During senate elections in the fall, the pair attended more than 20 club meetings to encourage students to run for the senate. As a result, nine female senators were elected, an increase from the five women who held seats last year.
Earlier in January, members of the GUSA Senate also participated in a Diversity Summit that focused on reenergizing GUSA’s diversity agenda.
“If one of our legacies to the next GUSA executives and forevermore is that we were able to bring issues of diversity and inclusion to the table so that they had to be talked about, then I think we’ve accomplished a lot,” Kohnert-Yount said.
 
Student Safety
The beginning of Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount’s term was characterized by heated debate over the inclusion of an LGBTQ-friendly checkbox on freshman housing surveys. In a viewpoint published in The Hoya (“Acceptance Shouldn’t Be Optional, But Expected,” A3, March 27, 2012), Nick Shaker (COL ’12) criticized the proposal for implying that acceptance and tolerance were optional.
The debate eventually led to the formation of the Safe Transitions Working group that worked extensively during the summer to evaluate the proposal and other potential means of increasing on-campus safety for LGBTQ students.
Although the original checkbox initiative fell through, Gustafson said she was satisfied with alternative measures that resulted from the working group, which included a non-discrimination statement that all students must sign as part of the housing process and a Safe Spaces Program thatwill train student volunteers to mediate conflict and provide resources to victims of discrimination.
“Out of that came a much more comprehensive approach to something that we were trying to solve with a bandage. There are ideas that we are able to have but things that we are not ultimately able to see and we need more people to be brought into the process to solve a problem that we were trying to address with our little idea,” Gustafson said.
A working group on promoting awareness and prevention against sexual assault during New Student Orientation has also been formed as part of an effort to create a safer campus.
“We’re probably going to see more progress in the next year on those issues than we had seen in the last 10 years on those issues, and that’s something, frankly, if two women haven’t been in this role, that issue would have never come up on the table,” Kohnert-Yount said.
 
Increasing Student Voices
One of Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount’s primary focuses throughout their term was to secure student participation in the university’s decision-making process after the pair saw little student involvement in the negotiated 2010 Campus Plan last summer.
“We have pushed incredibly hard to make sure student perspectives have been included in every conversation about students on campus,” Kohnert-Yount said.
Their most notable success was collaborating with the GUSA Senate to hold a referendum last fall urging Vice President of Students Affairs Todd Olson to change the Student Code of Conduct’s burden of proof for the evidentiary standard from “more likely than not” to “clear and convincing.”
The referendum saw a record turnout of 2,629 votes, with 96 percent in support of the change. When Olson finally accepted the recommendation in late October, he said the GUSA referendum played a significant role in his decision.
“I am also grateful to the leadership of GUSA, who brought the voice of the student body very clearly to university administrators on this topic.  I considered heavily student opinions, most recently expressed through the recent referendum vote overwhelmingly supporting this change,” Olson wrote in the Oct. 18 email announcement.
“You have to educate students on why it’s important to vote and organize behind this incredibly powerful force, and use that momentum to translate into an actual push,” Kohnert-Yount said.
However, the pair’s commitment to ensuring student voices are heard extends beyond the referendum.
After a summer spent petitioning the university for greater student input in town-gown discussions, Gustafson secured a spot on the Georgetown Community Partnership, a body composed of members of the university and multiple neighborhood groups that develops the campus plan.
According to Gustafson, the working groups under the GCP — which are concerned with student life, conduct and safety, environmental issues, landlord issues, transportation and parking, communications and engagement, metrics and data — have helped shape productive conversations between neighbors and students.
“Students, administrators, and neighbors work together to talk about the issues and come up with ways to not ensure everyone’s happy, but create a better quality of life for everyone involved. It’s going to be a challenge and will continue to be one, because it’s a relationship-based discussion, and you have to be willing to listen and speak up,” she said.
GUSA has also held town halls to encourage student input on designs of the New South Student Center. Earlier last month, Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount signed a memorandum with Olson to ensure student staffing and 18-plus events at the NSSC Pub. The memorandumguaranteed student input and involvement in the future development process.
Furthermore, Gustafson is in the process of communicating with the Department of Human Resources to generate a list of recommendations on how administrators can effectively partner with students, such as by utilizing HoyaLink and IdeaScale.
“If we have someone from GUSA going to the first employee training no matter what their job is, saying students want them involved in their lives, I think sends a huge message on how we want to interact with each other, treated with respect, and being included in every process, however it affects us,” Gustafson said.
 
Results and Unfinished Projects
One of the largest initiatives of Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount’s campaign platform was to promote intellectual life. The pair has spearheaded the Campus Ministry Report and Intellectual Life Space Report, which are slated to be released by April.
They have also delivered on their promise through collaboration with the Inter-School Academic Council to make professor and course evaluations directly accessible through MyAccess and to sponsor the first university-wide undergraduate research symposium, which will take place on the last day of their term Saturday.
Despite these tangible results, the pair said they encountered difficulties in completing some of their initiatives, notably the failure to establish an Office of Sustainability.
Gustafson explained that the 2010 Campus Plan last summer altered the administration’s priorities.
“[The campus plan] refocused the university administration to the long-term, which is great, but we wanted an office now because there is a lot of need for centralized ways to do sustainability issues at Georgetown,” she said.
Kohnert-Yount agreed and pointed out that the university’s limited resources prevented the executive from accomplishing all of its goals.
“The campus plan brought a lot of priorities to the forefront that made the Office of Sustainability challenging. There were a lot of competing priorities,” Kohnert-Yount said.
The pair, however, expressed optimism for the creation of the office as Vice President for Housing and Facilities Robin Morey took office this semester.
“A lot of results we won’t see happen in our term, but we’re there advocating and planting the seed by saying, ‘Hey, you need to think about this and come up with a plan,’” Kohnert-Yount said.
The pair also saw limited success in improving facilities and spaces for art and athletic student groups, but stressed that they maintained active participation in discussions about NSSC and the new Intercollegiate Athletic Center.
“Space is a challenging issue, and it will always be, but we held the status quo during a time it could have been lost,” Gustafson said.
Introducing athletic trainers for club sports was also an initiative that Gustafson and Kohernt-Yount’s administration worked on with limited success. The Advisory Board for Club Sports’ proposal to establish athletic trainers was denied at the GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee’s Budget Summit Feb. 24.
GUSA Director of SAFE Reform Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), who also ran against Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount in 2012’s GUSA race, said the pair provided him strong support to oversee the implementation of the three SAFE proposals, which include establishing the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, installing solar panels on townhouses, and renovating the New South Student Center.
“Clara and Vail gave me very specific tasks but also gave me flexibility to do my job. They should certainly be getting credit for overseeing the final implementation of the SAFE reform,” he said. “I think they did what they campaigned on and what they told students they would do. Obviously there are areas and policies or approaches that I agreed with and I disagreed with, but when it pertains to my role, I think they’ve done a good job.”
Tyler Sax (COL ’13), who also ran for the GUSA presidency against Gustafson, approved of the pair’s performance over the past year.
“I was happy to see them taking the reins despite not winning myself,” Sax said. “They’ve served Georgetown admirably and they can boast a record as GUSA executives that will stand for a long time.”
Overall, the pair said they were satisfied with their ability to increase interaction between the university administration and the student body and ensure students were delivered the education promised by Georgetown’s Jesuit values.
“The fact that we were able to be women for these men and women for others has been such an honor,” Kohnert-Yount said.

University President John J. DeGioia announced revisions to his financial plan for the upcoming fiscal year in a letter to the Georgetown community March 14 after receiving backlash in response to a proposal that would have frozen pay raises for staff while maintaining increases for faculty.
The new plan, which reflected recommendations by University Provost Robert Groves and the university’s executive vice presidents, called for a 0.75 percent increase to the staff merit increase pool, a six-month delay in the scheduled faculty salary plan increases, a continuation of the salary raise freeze for DeGioia, the executive vice presidents, the senior vice presidents and deans, three additional paid vacation days between Christmas and New Year’s Day and no increase to parking and daycare fees.
“Taken as a whole, these measures provide for a fairer and more balanced approach to staff and faculty compensation in a highly constrained economic environment and keep us on track to significantly improve the university’s financial performance,” the recommendation team wrote in its March 13 memorandum to DeGioia.
In contrast, the original proposal called for a full raise freeze for staff, with both tenure-track and non-tenure-track faculty remaining eligible for merit-based pay increases. The financial plan still includes provisions to reduce expenditures in non-academic university departments by 1 percent annually, decrease projected compensation growth by $7 million and increase graduate student enrollment.
The financial plan ultimately seeks to eliminate the university’s $19 million deficit over the next five years.
“We have taken a conservative approach to allocating resources ensuring that we focus our attention on critical competitive issues such as access and affordability, faculty and staff salary plans, vital academic capital projects and investments in innovative programs,” DeGioia wrote in the letter. “We are facing a challenging environment in higher education, which impacts the financial decisions our community must make.”
DeGioia added that the federal sequestration threatens millions of dollars in possible funding.
“We have been working to identify ways to eliminate our operating deficit, ensure Georgetown’s competitiveness and maintain our commitment to access and affordability,” DeGioia wrote.
However, some faculty members are still unhappy with the revised proposal.
School of Foreign Service Faculty Chair David Edelstein acknowledged that the 0.75 percent pay raise for staff does not keep up with inflation.
“A 0.75 percent pay raise for anybody is, in real terms, a pay cut,” Edelstein said. “I don’t think that is a situation anybody wishes anybody was in. All of the faculty think that our staff work awfully hard.”
Edelstein acknowledged that these efforts attempted to decrease the inequality between treatment of faculty and staff.
“There was some effort in the new plan to introduce some money back into the staff pool, but they did it in a way that, yes, introduces some money back … but only in a way that draws more attention to the fact that this inequality still persists.”
Additionally, Edelstein emphasized that some of the university’s concessions were empty gestures.
“What they were trying to do was they were trying to find ways that they can give things to staff that frankly don’t cost them all that much,” Edelstein said. “Truth be told, the university is basically always closed between Christmas and New Year’s. DeGioia announces in the fall that we’re making those special holiday days, and the university closes. I suspect that gesture, while appreciated … probably everybody noticed it was pushing against an open door.”
But German department Chair Peter Pfeiffer, who had submitted a letter opposing the raise freeze to the university’s board of directors, said that the discussion process reflected a willingness to listen to faculty and staff input.
“I think this shows the campus community can come together in positive ways that include everyone,” Pfeiffer said. “It may have been a process that was flawed early on, but the way the campus has responded since then, including the response by the administration, has been actually a very positive sign.”
Edelstein agreed that the revision represents a good faith attempt by the administration to address a perplexing financial problem.
“I don’t know what I would have done differently. It’s a really difficult puzzle. I don’t know that they got it right, but I don’t know that I could get it more right in a way that wouldn’t anger the people they’ve angered,” he said.
Pfeiffer agreed.
“I think it shows that there is a more equitable way of … [assuring] the university is financially stable and is prepared for some eventualities that may be coming down the pipe,” Pfeiffer said. “I think everybody can live with this, and I think it’s not the best of both worlds, but it’s a better response than what we had before.”
Until the university releases its budget for the upcoming fiscal year, the effects of this revised plan will remain uncertain.
“Full budgets haven’t come out yet, and everyone’s waiting to see what those will look like,” Edelstein said. “All [of the plan] adds up to revenues and expenditures … no one knows what the budget looks like yet, so it’s hard to speculate what the effects will be.”

With professors like former Secretary of State Madeline Albright and journalist E. J. Dionne teaching undergraduates every semester, Georgetown students are no strangers to sharpening their minds in the midst of prominent intellectuals.
Many Georgetown professors, too, were inspired and educated by world-renowned academics and icons of the 20th century.
Thirty years ago, Jan Karski (GRD ’52), an active member of the Polish World War II resistance movement, was on the search committee that hired Eusebio Mujal-Leon, a professor in the government department. Karski earned his doctorate from Georgetown in 1952 and began his 40-year-long teaching career in the government department in 1954. Before coming to Georgetown, however, Karski was held in German and Soviet captivity, enduring intense torture during his efforts to enlighten the world about the Holocaust.
“I didn’t know him well, but I certainly admired him,” Mujal-Leon said. “Just knowing about him affects you. It was clear that he was an exceptional person. He was really a fixture at this university. To me the most powerful way of describing him is as an honorable man.”
Posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012, Karski is commemorated on campus with a statue outside of White-Gravenor Hall. According to Mujal-Leon, Karski was a very popular professor who told captivating stories during class.
“The stories were not just of the normal, ordinary kind, but reflected his life experiences. That type of learning is very valuable,” Mujal-Leon said. “There are different types of knowledge and lived knowledge of a tragedy is something extraordinary.”
Philosophy professor Nancy Sherman recalls her own experience learning from celebrated philosophy professor John Rawls at Harvard University. Referred to by some as the greatest political philosopher of the 20th century, Rawls is known for his revision of the traditional social contract theory as well as his historical understanding of moral and political philosophy. While a graduate student at Harvard, Sherman was enrolled in a handful of his courses on subjects including the theory of justice and moral philosophy.
“Rawls was famously modest and self-effacing,” she said. “That certainly characterized my picture of him as well. He was very humble and also an extremely demanding scholar.”
Sherman says she remembers that he lectured entirely from handwritten notes, at times up to 24 pages long. Rawls also served as one of Sherman’s advisers for her thesis on Aristotle.
“He said to me ‘I’m happy to mentor you, but I don’t know much about Aristotle’s ethics.’ Of course, he certainly did, but didn’t want to present himself as an Aristotle ethics scholar,” she said.
In his graduate years at the University of Chicago, government professor Keir Lieber studied under renowned political scientist John Mearsheimer, who is known for his contributions to the theory of offensive realism.
“People have good ideas but a lot of people are ‘complexifiers.’ He’s a simplifier,” Lieber said. “He is able to articulate his views and arguments in a way that almost anyone can understand. His view is that … professors shouldn’t hide behind needlessly complex jargon.”
Lieber worked as Mearsheimer’s teaching assistant for the course “War and the Nation State.”
“Students loved him. He was very funny. He makes provocative arguments,” Lieber said. “He used to be called the dark prince because of his views … [but] in reality he is one of the kindest, most generous, most open people in the profession.”
E.J. Dionne, columnist for The Washington Post and professor in the government department and Georgetown Public Policy Institute, has studied under several high-profile individuals. He said that these figures enriched his interest in the relationship between politics and religion, topics he teaches as a professor.
As an undergraduate at Harvard, Dionne learned from leading philosophers Michael Walzer and Robert Nozick — whose office was down the hall from Rawls’.
“All these years later I am still a student of Michael Walzer. There are a lot of things in those courses that stayed with me,” Dionne said.
According to Dionne, the most relevant course he ever took was called Eschatology and Politics taught by famous liberal theologian Harvey Cox. Years later as a reporter for The New York Times in the mid-1980s, Dionne was assigned to be the Rome Bureau Chief covering the Vatican, Pope John Paul II, and then Pope Benedict XVI.
Dionne’s experience learning from Walzer stayed with him as he covered the pope, just as his experience in the Vatican stays with him as a Georgetown professor.
“Thirteen years later I find myself covering the Vatican when folks from our class readings were at the center of the news,” Dionne said.
Dionne is not alone in having drawn on the teaching and academic practices of esteemed professors.
Lieber said he seeks to emulate a similar clarity and straightforward approach with his students.
“One of [Mearsheimer’s] teachings is that we are fortunate to be professors,” Lieber said. “As part of that opportunity, we have a social obligation to try and say something about important real world problems. I think that’s a good guide to one’s career.”
Sherman, too, said her approach to philosophy resembles that of Rawls in her commitment to the history of moral philosophy and fidelity to text. But perhaps above all, she remembers Rawls for his venerable classroom presence.
“We all knew we were at the foot of a great master,” she recalled.

When Joshua Siegel (GRD ’00) and Andrew Romans (GRD ’01) first met as students of Georgetown’s Masters in Business Administration program, they realized that, unlike those at many peer universities, Georgetown alumni were not investing in startup companies.
Last summer, Siegel and Romans began discussing plans to fill that void and officially launched Georgetown Alumni Angels Oct. 1, which will give alumni a chance to pool resources to invest in promising startups.
“We felt that because Georgetown is such a large and well-known community, it really needed its own group,” Siegel said. “It wasn’t something that the school could put together on a rapid basis. We decided that we could put it together quickly, effectively [and] efficiently.”
“The Georgetown alumni community is quite powerful and amazing, and so we want to harness that,” Romans added.
According to Romans, angel investing — when an individual or group of investors provide financial support for small startups and entrepreneurs — has grown in importance since the recent financial crisis, which caused venture capital firms to decrease investments in startups worldwide.
The investment group will pay particular attention to those startups that have a connection with the university, although its resources will not be limited to Georgetown companies.
“If someone goes to Georgetown and has a great company and we like it, then we want to fund it,” Romans said. “These guys should be able to get funding.”
Siegel said the start-ups with a Georgetown link would receive particular consideration. “For Georgetown deals … we will go the extra mile,” Siegel said. “We will always speak to the entrepreneur … so that we can look at their deal and try to refine it.”
According to Romans and Siegel, the group has already received proposals from alumni entrepreneurs in Germany, Turkey, Spain and Israel.
“We will evaluate each and every deal that comes to us, but we reject 99 percent of people that come to us on the entrepreneurial side,” Siegel said.
After examining such factors as a company’s financials and management team, Siegel and Romans will decide whether a company warrants funding. The few companies selected will be able to make a brief presentation to GAA investors — who are all either Georgetown alumni or affiliated with the university — and then network directly with the investors.
“It’s a little bit like speed dating,” Romans said. “When you meet somebody, you can decide within the first 30 seconds if you think that she or he is totally crazy and there’s no way you’d ever invest in that company.”
Siegel said GAA receives about five proposals a day, 90 percent of which he estimated have some relation to Georgetown.
GAA plans to hold networking events several times a year, the first of which is set for early March in New York City. Siegel said seven companies have been chosen to present at the event, six of which have a Georgetown connection. Though GAA cannot yet disclose their identity, the group includes startups involved in mobile payments, entertainment and mobile advertising.
GAA plans to invest between $250,000 and $750,000 in the selected startups. The group will support the selected companies for about two years, at which time it will refer the entrepreneurs to venture capital firms.
“In order for a startup to be successful, it needs more than just cash. It needs connections, and it needs guidance,” Romans said. “Part of what we’re doing is harnessing the Georgetown alumni community to make these companies successful.”
According to Siegel, one of the top priorities for the GAA is acquiring more professors and industry experts to serve as mentors for the entrepreneurs.
“Part of what should be appealing about going to Georgetown is that [students] know that there’s this powerful group of alumni that are organized and are able to review a deal, invest in the best ones and make them successful,” Romans said.

Mayor Vincent Gray announced late February that he will pursue an ambitious sustainability plan that aims to make Washington, D.C., the most environmentally friendly city in the country by 2032.
“In just one generation — 20 years — the District of Columbia will be the healthiest, greenest and most livable city in the United States,” Gray said at an event Feb. 20. “We will demonstrate how enhancing our natural and built environments, investing in a diverse clean economy, and reducing disparities among residents can create an educated, equitable and prosperous society.”
The plan, called Sustainable D.C., hopes to cut overall energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions in half, as well as lower waste production by 15 percent. According to the plan, the reductions would be achieved mainly by expanding the use of public transportation systems and bike paths. In addition, Sustainable D.C. resolves to plant 150,000 additional trees across the city and to weatherize many publicly owned buildings by installing gardens on their rooftops.
Both neighborhood politicians and Georgetown officials commended the mayor’s initiative.
Ron Lewis, chair of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, which includes Georgetown, expressed his hope that Sustainable D.C.’s efforts to make the city more sustainable would complement those already being undertaken by Georgetown.
“D.C. should lead the nation in going green, in my opinion, in every way that we can. Already Georgetown University and the community around it are very conscious of the benefits of green environment,” Lewis said. “I applaud the mayor’s initiative to bring a greener approach throughout the whole city.”
However, Lewis noted that implementing the plan would not come without some sacrifices.
“It’s true of every initiative that there are always tradeoffs,” Lewis said. “And there’s no free lunch. It’s just reality that when it comes time to implement any particular plan it becomes time to consider the tradeoffs very particularly.”
Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey also applauded the mayor’s plan and said he hoped that the university’s collaboration with the city government on sustainability issues would continue.
“Georgetown is committed to helping the city achieve its goals to become a greener and healthier city, as demonstrated by our president’s leadership in signing the [D.C.] College and University Sustainability Pledge last year,” Morey said. “We recognize that our campus can play a key role in helping to demonstrate and advance sustainability in our community, and under the CUSP pledge framework we look forward to engaging in the mayor’s ambitious sustainability plan.”
Morey added that Georgetown has in the past decade undertaken several steps to reduce its carbon footprint. Since 2006, the university has reduced gas emissions by over 20 percent per square foot of building space, and beginning in November 2012, Georgetown started purchasing 100 percent renewable-certified electricity for the main, medical and east campuses. According to Morey, the university now ranks fourth among universities nationwide in purchasing green power.
Program Coordinator for Sustainability Audrey Stewart also cited many of the common goals that Georgetown’s efforts on behalf of the environment share with the mayor’s plan.
“Many of our current and planned projects support the city’s goals in Sustainable D.C. For example, the rainwater capture cistern under Regents Hall and the planned rain garden at the New South Student Center contribute to a healthier local watershed and will help reduce pressure on municipal infrastructure. We have also recently expanded our food waste composting initiative to include Epicurean, which helps move the campus toward a zero-waste future,” Stewart said. “We hope that projects like these will help contribute to local municipal goals, in addition to achieving our own goals for a sustainable campus.”

Nearly an hour after white smoke began billowing out of the Sistine Chapel chimney on Wednesday afternoon, Fr. Jorge Mario Bergoglio, S.J., formally introduced himself to the world as Pope Francis.
The choice of Francis, who previously served as the archbishop of Buenos Aires, was a surprise to the many faithful observers and oddsmakers watching the conclave, as his papacy represents a number of firsts for the Roman Catholic Church: He is the first pontiff from Latin America, the first to take an entirely new name since Pope Lando in 913 and the first from the Society of Jesus.
“I think a lot of us are just surprised. We have a Jesuit pope. I don’t think anyone was expecting that to happen.” Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J. (COL ’88), vice president for mission and ministry at Georgetown, said.
At Georgetown, the Healy Hall bells rang out as the oldest Catholic and Jesuit university in the United States celebrated the elevation of a Jesuit pope. Many students joined in, some even running from Healy Circle to Wolfington Hall with Vatican flags. The Office of the Vice President for Mission and Ministry quickly organized a Mass of thanksgiving in Dahlgren Chapel later that evening.
Kieran Raval (COL ’13), former grand knight of the Georgetown University Council of the Knights of Columbus, said that he was thrilled to hear about Francis’s elevation.
“I think my first reaction was really just joy,” Raval said. “I think there’s a very palpable sense of unity in the Church when over a billion people worldwide are coming together in a spirit of prayer and celebration, with the added twist that it’s our first Jesuit pope and we’re at the nation’s oldest Catholic and Jesuit university. That made it particularly special.”
O’Brien, who gave the homily at Wednesday’s Mass, believes that Francis’s experience as a Jesuit will influence his papacy.
 
“Francis spent many decades of his life as a Jesuit, and that will no doubt inform how he is as a pope — his style [and] maybe his priorities,” he said. “The Jesuit spirituality is very earthy, very grounded in the belief that we can find God in all things — that we should meet people where they’re at. … I think he’ll bring that type of spirituality with him to his office.”
History professor Fr. David Collins, S.J. emphasized the importance of Francis’ experience training other Jesuits in his role as a novice master, a position which required him to foster the newest members of the Society of Jesus.
“There’s a lot of Jesuit training that will be imported into the way that he operates,” Collins said. “There’s a certain pragmatic, let’s-get-it-done attitude the Jesuits have.”
Collins said that he believes Francis will bring this mentality to the Curia, the Vatican’s bureaucracy, which many — such as Roman Catholic expert George Weigel — consider poorly managed. Nevertheless, Collins was quick to point out that Francis’s Jesuit background is one of many important qualities that will influence his papacy.
Some say that the pope’s humility will be a defining characteristic for the new pope.
“He’s a man interested in a kind of noble simplicity,” Raval said. “He seems likely to bring the Vatican back into focus on the basics of the faith: preaching the truth — the whole truth — with faith and love, administering the sacraments, caring for the impoverished and being an evangelical force as well.”
O’Brien agreed.
“He’s a man of great poverty and humility. I think that’s what made the selection of his name so important,” O’Brien said. “I think he’ll bring his commitment to poverty and to social justice to the papacy.”
Raval added that the pope’s choice to take the name Francis — which was inspired by St. Francis of Assisi, a priest devoted to serving the poor and founder of the Franciscans — reinforced the idea of the new pontiff’s commitment to social justice.
That Francis is the first pontiff from the Americas, however, is considered by many to be the most remarkable aspect of the Catholic Church’s new leader.
“I think that [the fact that] he’s from Latin America is the huger, bigger deal,” Collins said. “Europe and the Mediterranean world — that’s where Christianity began — and this is the first time that it’s leapt out of that world.”
For Sam Dulik (SFS ’13), vice president of public affairs for the Latin American Student Association, the pope’s election was an exciting revelation.
“We’re so phenomenally proud, just buoyant,” Dulik said. “This [Latin America] is where the growth is. I think this is a huge sign from the College of Cardinals that this is an area they want to invest in.”
Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., a government professor who specializes in Latin America, stressed that the election of Francis is an important step for the Church.
“This clearly reflects where the concentration of Catholics really are,” Carnes said. “There are more than twice as many in Latin America than in Europe. So really, where is the center of Catholicism? It’s in the global south.”
Carnes believes that socioeconomic conditions in Latin America have shaped the Catholic Church’s attention to social justice and that this experience has led the Latin American Church to be more humble and place an increased focus on serving the poor.
According to history professor Erik Langer, director of the Center for Latin American Studies, Pope Francis has earned a reputation for being at odds with the Argentine government.
“One thing to understand is that the Church hierarchy in Argentina is very conservative. It’s probably one of the most conservative — if not the most conservative — in Latin America,” Langer said. “And although the pope is seen as moderate within that hierarchy, that still makes him somewhat conservative. He has, in the past, criticized very heavily Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the president of Argentina. He is seen as someone who is not very friendly to the president or to any of the populist, new left leaders in Latin America.”
Francis must now address the many challenges facing the Vatican. Externally, the Church must confront declining faith among European Catholics — Europe was the only region in the world to see a decrease in the number of Catholics between 1990 and 2010, according to figures from the Vatican — and the global rise of Islam, which had an increase of over a million European followers since 2001, according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life.
In addition, the new pontiff must face the Church’s ongoing sexual abuse scandal, which intensified during the papacy of Benedict XVI when many Catholics, especially in Europe, stepped forward with abuse claims.
Internally, the Church is divided within its administration on issues such as management of the Vatican Bank and meeting international standards of anti-money laundering laws, which was revealed in secret documents recently leaked to the Italian media.
According to Carnes, the pope needs to be able to exert his influence to make real changes.
“People get very used to the idea that ‘This is the way we’ve always done it,’ and I’m sure he had to overcome that already three or four times today,” Carnes said. “My hope is that he’ll keep doing that in every respect. Then, that really is a witness for the rest of us. We can break down our own fears of what would happen. I’m hopeful he can break down the structures and invite us to a different kind of living Church.”

The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority held a meeting Thursday night for Ward 2 residents concerned about rising prices of residential water usage and the upcoming Clean Rivers Project, which aims to reduce sewage overflow.
The town hall meeting was cohosted by D.C. Water General Manager George Hawkins and Ward 2 Councilman Jack Evans.
Hawkins focused first on the rising water costs that have been a recent point of conflict for DC residents. For fiscal year 2014, the average single family monthly bill will rise to $77.46, up by $6.28 from fiscal year 2013. This marks a net increase of $12.02 from just two years ago.
Hawkins partially attributed the rising rates to increased costs faced by D.C Water due to the Capital Improvement Program, an ongoing ten-year, $3.8 billion project for water and sewage infrastructure in the District.
“We realize that the costs are rising, but we also feel that they are necessary to cover the costs of projects that will ultimately benefit the residents of the city,” Hawkins said.
Hawkins also cited increased health costs for D.C. Water employees as a result of the Affordable Care Act for the increase in water prices.
Hawkins also responded to the mounting criticism from Ward 2 residents regarding D.C. Water’s Clean Rivers Project. As currently proposed, the initiative will involve digging beneath the Potomac River waterbed to create a 58-million-gallon storage tunnel that will reduce the amount of raw sewage that ends up in the river after storms.
Specifically, the Advisory Neighborhood Commission expressed concern about the size and placement of the shafts that would be required to build the tunnels. In order to connect the tunnels to the riverbed, project engineers may have to uproot green space between Washington Harbor and the Kennedy Center, according to Evans.
Hawkins admitted that the size, which would be the widest of these types of tunnels in the city, could potentially cause some disruption to residents living on the waterfront.
The meeting closed with concerns from Foggy Bottom and West End residents who complained about noise from ongoing construction projects in the area to repair aging pipes. Residents complained that repairs were performed during the middle of the night, making it difficult for them to sleep.
Hawkins responded to the criticism by telling residents that when pipes burst they must be attended to immediately, regardless of the hour.
“It’s ultimately our responsibility to listen to the needs of the residents,” Hawkins said. “However, it also needs to be understood that we can’t please everybody — though we will try — but reconstruction and maintenance will always be tasks that require intrusions.”

College Traffic, an online goods and services exchange for students developed by alumni Alex Seilliere(MSB ’12) and Andrew Boggs (COL ’12), will officially launch today after the idea began in an entrepreneurship class at Georgetown.
Seilliere conceived the concept for College Traffic in professor William Finnerty’s “Entrepreneurship Foundations” class during his junior year. He said the idea was based on conversations he had with classmates.
“[The class] was a game changer in my Georgetown education,” Seilliere said. “A lot of my friends told me they would use this website on a daily basis if it was created.”
The two said that their experiences as Georgetown students influenced their development of the site.
“I always ended up getting my books really late on Amazon,” Boggs said. “We wait for the last minute, we want to save money, we want do things as simply as possible. The stuff you’re looking for from year to year are similar.”
Seilliere brought Boggs into the project last March, and the two began to meet with developers, mentors and potential investors. Eventually, they decided to move the development base to Ukraine to cut costs.
“We started in D.C. and figured out it would be easier and cheaper to develop it in Ukraine,” Seillieresaid. “We worked on it for three weeks and managed to get a website going for way cheaper.”
The website aims to serve as a common platform used by students searching for goods and services.
Boggs emphasized that the website will be only be available to students and faculty, an exclusivity he hopes will differentiate College Traffic from other online marketplaces and create a safer environment.
The site will initially be available to students and faculty at Georgetown, The George Washington University, American University and Howard University. Boggs said, however, that he and Selliere plan to expand the website to ten to fifteen other cities by next fall.
“It’s all local. Georgetown, George Washington and American will all share the same network. You couldn’t tap into that from over in California, for example,” Boggs said. “[But] we’d like to see College Traffic across the country.”
A beta version of the site has been up and running for four months, during which Seilliere and Boggs have been testing with focus groups.
“We now work with in-house developers, and we are ready to go live,” Boggs said.
Although the website officially launches today, Seilliere and Boggs said that they will maintain the flexibility to add new features, including one that will allow students to find deals in the Georgetown area, which they plan to add in mid-April.
Seilliere anticipates that attracting users will be the startup’s biggest challenge.
“No one’s going to want to arrive in a site that’s [empty] like a desert,” Seilliere said.
“College students can be tough to convince,” Boggs added. “We’re trying to think out of the box in terms of marketing, keeping it new and relevant.”

Despite coming up short in this year’s GUSA election, Jack Appelbaum, Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson and Spencer Walsh will feature prominently in the next executive staff.
“It takes a lot of guts and dedication to run, and when forming our team we looked to these people first as students who have proven their commitment to making Georgetown a better place,” President-elect Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said.
Appelbaum (COL ’14), who was front-runner in the Georgetown University Student Association race and finished a narrow second to Tisa and Vice President-elect Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14), will serve as a senior counselor in the next administration. Tisa predicted that Appelbaum, as former chair of the Student Activities Commission, will provide strong institution experience.
“We want to work with him on student space, reducing bureaucracy, cutting the red tape. He’s somebody that we’re going to really be able to count on for advice,” Tisa said.
Appelbaum served as director of student life report implementation for outgoing GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13). He identified student space as a commonality between his campaign platform and Tisa’s.
“We’ll be focus a lot on student space, which was a point of similarity between Maggie’s and my platform and Nate and Adam’s platform. Getting more student space on campus, making sure there is more student voice in the decision making on campus,” Appelbaum said.
Walsh (MSB ’14), a computer science minor, will be director of technology. One of the central initiatives in Walsh’s platform was increasing GUSA engagement through more efficient use of technology.
Most notably, Walsh was an outspoken critic of the GUSA website, which was unavailable from the beginning of last fall until the end of this January due to a platform switch.
“The administration is only in office for a year. How do we get things done quickly? How would you engage students with technology with innovative ways? Flyers and emails can only go so far,” Walsh said.
Tisa said that one of Walsh’s central goals would be to shift GUSA records to the website to facilitate student access.
Corbin-Johnson (SFS ’14), who emphasized her involvement in diverse extracurricular groups during the campaign, will be director of group outreach.
“Shavonnia, during the campaign, talked a lot about reaching out to groups and really connecting to diversity and advocacy groups, so we have a lot of faith in her ability and passion for getting contact with the students,” Tisa said.
Senate Speaker Zach Singer (SFS ’15), who was formerly vice speaker and took over Tisa’s position as speaker after Tisa was elected president, will serve as chief of staff. Singer served as Tisa’s campaign manager and must resign the senate to join the executive.
“I’m excited for this position. Something I feel very strongly about is the free speech on campus, for example. As chief of staff, I will be able to work closely and intensively with such issues,” Singer said.
Ben Manzione (SFS ’15) will be transition chair, while Emily Perkins (COL ’14) will be director of communications.
Tisa will announce his deputy chiefs of staff, communications team, director of special initiatives and senior advisers Saturday.
The GUSA executive comprises two branches: the staff and cabinet. Staff members are handpicked by the executive leaders, while cabinet positions are chosen among applicants from the student body. Applications to cabinet positions will open Sunday and are due the following Thursday.
“We’re excited for that because it’s a cross-section for Georgetown, anyone who we don’t know yet or who we’ve worked with, people who are the most passionate and dedicated to specific issues,” Tisasaid.

An ad hoc committee on undergraduate grading policy at Yale University that recommended a series of proposals aimed at addressing the university’s rampant grade inflation has drawn attention to swollenGPAs at schools across the nation.   .
In the spring semester of 2012, 62 percent of the Yale student body received A’s, compared to 40 years ago when this figure was only 10 percent.
The committee recommended Feb. 7 that the university switch from a letter grade system to a 100-point scale, which will give the faculty more flexibility in assigning grades. The panel suggested a grade distribution that would place 35 percent of students in the A range, 40 percent of students in the B range, 20 percent in the C range, 4 to 5 percent of students in the D range and less than 1 percent meriting an F. If approved by the faculty, the proposals will be implemented in the 2014-2015 school year.
Other institutions have also attempted to reduce grade inflation. Nine years ago, Princeton University introduced a standardized grade distribution which keeps the levels of A’s below 40 percent.
Georgetown has not been immune from grade inflation but has taken little concrete action to curtail the trend.
“The median grade has continued to go up at Georgetown, as it has at other institutions,” University Registrar and Assistant Provost John Pierce said. “Grades have been going up across the board.”
Over 50 percent of Georgetown College graduates last year received some form of Latin honors, putting the school’s median grade point average above 3.5, according to an editorial in The Hoya this fall. Yale instituted a policy in 1988 capping the percentage of students who graduate with Latin honors at 30, according to the Yale Daily News.
Despite this high statistic, Georgetown students reported that they dedicate fewer hours to coursework than students at peer institutions, according to a survey from the 1998 and 2008 Intellectual Life Reports authored by the Main Executive Faculty.
“Those reports encouraged faculty to challenge students a bit more and consider limiting grades in the A, A- range to approximately 30 to 35 percent of the students in a given course,” MEF Chair and theology professor Terrence Reynolds said.  “Naturally, these were recommendations and not requirements, and as I gather, individual professors and departments have responded to them somewhat differently.”
The McDonough School of Business is the only school at Georgetown to require that departments use a standardized grade distribution. The MSB implemented a grading curve with a maximum average of 3.3 in core courses in the spring of 2009.
“The rationale for the grading curve was consistency in grading and evaluation of the students across sections, particularly where there are many sections of the same course,” Norean Sharpe, senior associate dean and director of undergraduate programs in the MSB, said. “It really was put in place by the faculty out of fairness and equity from the student perspective because of feedback that we had received.”
Sharpe also noted that employers have lauded with the grade distribution.
“I meet on a regular basis with folks from PwC, Deloitte, Citibank, Estee Lauder and Armani,” Sharpe said. “They know our curve and respect our scale and are saying, give us more graduate [and] undergraduate business students.”
College Senior Associate Dean Anne Sullivan noted that the philosophy department, among a few others, has implemented the changes recommended in the report but that many have chosen not to edit their policies.
“Some departments choose to use grading guidelines and others do not,” Sullivan said. “It is a problem to the extent that grading gives students feedback, and students deserve an opportunity to learn from their grade. It is a serious problem but one that’s hard to deal with because some professors will just say, look, all of these students deserve A’s.”
Reynolds worries that this kind of mentality is actually harmful to students.
“We should challenge [students] academically and imaginatively to produce their finest work,” Reynolds said. “Grade inflation, where it occurs, mistakenly suggests mastery of a subject area when something less than genuinely excellent work has been submitted.”
Students applying to law or graduate school, however, will compete against applicants from other undergraduate institutions that may follow significantly different grading policies.
“The Admissions Committee is aware that there is grade inflation at some undergraduate institutions,” said Caroline Springer, associate director of graduate admissions and professional development at the Georgetown Law Center.
According to Springer, the admissions committee receives information from the Law School Admission Council’s Law School Data Assembly Service that identifies the applicant’s GPA as well as the median GPA at the applicant’s college. She said that the report can allow the admissions committee to get a general idea of potential grade inflation.
Springer believes, however, that the grading policy at Georgetown puts its graduates on roughly the same footing as most other undergraduate programs.
“Georgetown’s median GPA, as reported by LSAC in the LSDAS report, seems to be in the middle range of the median GPAs reported by other institutions,” Springer said.
Mike Schaub, executive director at the Cawley Career Education Center, does not believe the grading policy at Georgetown plays much of a role in job applications, even though 25 percent of the jobs and internships listed on Hoya Career Connection include a minimum GPA requirement.
“Most employers weight internship experiences, leadership activities, written and oral communication skills, quality of the undergraduate education, and other personal characteristics more significantly than GPA when evaluating applicants,” Schaub wrote in an email.

A Friday and Saturday neighborhood shuttle service toDupont Circle and Adams Morgan will launch tonight, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson announced in an email to the student body March 12.
“Our responsibility is to provide this service, and we think we’re providing this service as a safety measure for students more than anything,” Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said.
The shuttle service, which will run Fridays and Saturdays from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m., will use 22-passenger busses and cost $12,000 for the remaining eight weeks of the semester. The shuttle will run from the tennis courts by McDonough Gymnasium to the corner of 20th Street and Massachusetts Avenue in Dupont Circle, with a stop at the corner of 18th Street and Columbia Avenue in Adams Morgan. Olson emphasized that the shuttles will benefit all students, not just upperclassmen.
“Both Dupont Circle and Adams Morgan have some appealing features open to everybody, not just those over 21 specifically,” Olson said, citing options like Kramerbooks & Afterwords Cafe in Dupont.
Morey said that the route, which uses the university’s Canal Road entrance and avoids the residential portion of Georgetown, was chosen to avoid disturbing neighbors.
“This is our initial take on the route,” Morey said. “If we find out there’s a better way to do it, we’re going to take that feedback and consider it.”
Unlike the Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle, which is catered to faculty, staff, undergraduates and graduate students, and operates infrequently on weekends, this shuttle will target undergraduates specifically, similar to the shuttle service to Burleith and M Street launched in fall 2011.
According to Morey, although the idea for a new shuttle has been on the table for a while, the Office of Student Life, Facilities Management and the Department of Public Safety officially proposed the idea three weeks ago with student input. Two Georgetown Community Partnership working groups — one on safety and student life, and one on transportation and parking — vetted the idea and officially approved the route March 13.
This shuttle is the latest attempt to improve the quality of student social life on campus and minimize late-night activity in the neighboring community. In his email, Olson emphasized the importance of enhancing student life as part of reducing noise and disruptive behavior in the surrounding neighborhoods.
“I’m hoping this might make the city more accessible for students and also make things smoother in the neighborhood, too,” Olson said. “The potential difference in number of people walking on Prospect might have to do with the number of them looking for cabs, but we have not analyzed things like cab usage in detail.”
Olson said the proposal balances the goal of the 2010 Campus Plan to bring social life back to campus.
“One of the things I’ve heard from students is that they are supportive of the idea, and we don’t want to isolate the students from Washington,” Olson said. “The shuttle is one of the ways to accomplish both goals — taking part of the social life out of the local neighborhood while also pursuing stuff to bring social life back to campus — we need to do a balancing act making sure there are options in the city.”
GCP Transportation and Parking working group member Jake Sticka (COL ’13) cited the new shuttle service as an example of a GCP success.
“The shuttles are really a product of GCP working,” Sticka said. “All sides involved in the community partnership — the students, the university and the neighbors — all sort of recognized something that would be great for all of us. It really shows the power and the potential of GCP when it’s working the way we all hope it will.”

The Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriations Committee released a draft budget Tuesday allocating $979,200 to on-campus student programs.
Available funds shot up $19,200 from last year’s allocation due to the standard rate of inflation — a measure made possible through the Student Activities Fee and Endowment Reform referendum of 2010.
However, Fin/App Committee Chair Sheila Walsh (COL ’14) described this year’s increase as “chump-change” in comparison to last year’s $160,000 increase in allocation funds due to the implementation of SAFE Reform.
Walsh said this funding plateau added an additional limitation to allocating money to organizations that have continually upped their overall proposal.
“This year represents the first budget summit that didn’t increase because of SAFE reform,” Walsh said. “So this means that, practically, we were looking at fiscal year 2013’s budget as a template, so you’re not going to see a lot of any drastic changes in allocation from fiscal year ’13 to fiscal year ’14.”
Walsh supported the idea of another SAFE referendum in the future to further increase available funding for student groups.
“I think that definitely down the road there is going to be a need for another Student Activities Fee increase,” Walsh said. “I can’t pinpoint an exact amount or when that referendum will have to happen, but I think that’s something that will come.”
Of the proposals, Fin/App allocated $234,000 — the largest single amount allocated — to the Advisory Board for Club Sports. While this amount increases ABCS funding from the $228,087 allocated to the board last year, the amount fell short of ABCS’ proposal and primarily denied $41,000 in funding for a start-up club sports trainer program — a big-ticket item on the ABCS agenda.
Walsh cites this budget cut as a reality of a limited budget with a multitude of proposals but said that the lack of funding does not represent a rejection of the proposed program.
“We can’t really dictate how [they] actually go about spending [their funding],” Walsh said. “So, club sports, they have the option of going to the individual teams saying as a blanket statement that we are going to fund your team at ‘x’ percentage … and they can make a conscious decision to direct more of that money to a pilot training program.”
Walsh added that the Fin/App Committee would be open to ABCS proposals for an athletic-trainer program in the years to come, especially with the presence of a pilot program.
The Student Activities Commission received $158,000 — 67 percent of the requested funds and the second largest allocation of all groups. However, this budget marked the first year that GUSA did not increase funding for SAC.
Most discrepancy occurred over social funding in which organizations often requested more than needed for events and maintenance. Walsh said the limited budget contributed to the decreased funding.
The Georgetown University Lecture Fund returned to GUSA for funding and was allocated $65,000 for the year, marking a $5,000 increase from last year’s funding. This will allow for the cosponsorship of events with SAC groups and aid the limited budget of SAC.
The Office of Campus Ministry, which presented a budget proposal of $23,950 on behalf of eight faith-based groups for the first time at this year’s GUSA budget summit, was allocated $12,000.
“The process [of integration] is evolving,” Walsh said of the inclusion of Campus Ministry into the GUSAbudget. “Initially [at] the start of the year, campus ministry was referring to themselves as an advisory board, but … they didn’t abide by [GUSA and Fin/App’s] Six-Point reforms.”
These points require the board to be entirely student-run, which was not the case with many faculty and administrative aspects of Campus Ministry.
“I hesitate to say that we’re hesitant in funding them, but it’s like a pilot for them,” Walsh said. “We can see what they do with the funding that we give them and if they decide to form a structure that abides byGUSA standards. … I think that’s something we are going to see down the road and I hope to see.”
Campus Ministry will take over funding for the Jewish Student Association, previously supported by SAC, freeing up around $6,800 to fund alternative groups.
The JSA was the last SAC-funded religious group. Despite their initial concerns, JSA decided to switch funding sources.
“Our only reservation was that Jewish students might confuse the work the JSA does with the work Jewish Chaplaincy does. Many students participate in JSA events because they revolve around community building and social life. The Chaplaincy focuses more on education and religious programming,” Isaac Mishlove (SFS ’15) said. “If a student was not so interested in Jewish education and religious programs, but more interested in community building and social life, we would not want that student to feel that the JSA’s ties to the Jewish Chaplaincy meant we were doing the same work as them.”
The Georgetown Media Board was allocated $51,000, which falls $7,000 short of the requested allocation due to denied funding for a new website for WGTB. Committee members thought the new website was unnecessary and financially unfeasible this year.
The Performing Arts Advisory Council’s funding request was granted in full at $32,500 and will be allocated toward storage space during construction of the New South Student Center.
Other non-board groups returned to GUSA for funding, including the Freshman, Sophomore and Junior Class Committees — allocated $5,000 in total — as well as Homecoming — granted $15,000 — and Traditions Day — granted $4,500 in funding.
The draft budget will be open to public critique and appeal until March 15. The Fin/App Committee will hear appeals through March 19 and will finalize the budget on March 20 to send to the GUSA senate for ratification.
