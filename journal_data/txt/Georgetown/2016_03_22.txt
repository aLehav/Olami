Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., (CAS ’88) will leave Georgetown to become dean of the Jesuit School of Theology at Santa Clara University at the end of this year, according to a campus-wide email sent by President John J. DeGioia.
O’Brien will start at Santa Clara University — a Jesuit, nonprofit, private university in California — Aug. 1.
“We welcome Fr. O’Brien as the next dean of the Jesuit School of Theology,” Santa Clara University President Rev. Michael E. Engh, S.J., said in a statement on Santa Clara University’s website. “His impressive leadership experience positions him well to help JST become a premier national and international center of graduate theological teaching, research, and ministerial formation. He brings passion as well as broad pastoral, managerial, and administrative experience needed for this complex role.”
Georgetown University will begin the search process for O’Brien’s replacement in the coming weeks, according to the email.
“This announcement is the result of several months of discussions, initiated by Kevin’s religious superiors, who asked him to consider assuming leadership of this school — one of the most important institutions in Catholic theological studies and ministry,” DeGioia wrote.
DeGioia cited O’Brien’s significant contributions to the university’s religious life during his tenure.
“Kevin has animated the religious and interreligious life of our students in countless ways — serving as the Jesuit-in-Residence in Copley Hall, teaching a theology course each semester, and working closely with Rabbi Rachel Gartner, Rev. Bryant Oskvig, Imam Yahya Hendi, Fr. Gregory Schenden, S.J., V. Rev. Constantine White, Rev. Khristi Adams and others across our campuses to ensure that our students — and all members of our community — are supported in their faith traditions,” DeGioia wrote.
O’Brien joined Georgetown in 2008 as the executive director of campus ministry, where he was responsible for overseeing all ministry programs on Georgetown’s campuses.
He became vice president for mission and ministry in 2011, where he has directed mission-focused and social justice programs. O’Brien also sought to partner with campus organizations, including the Division for Students Affairs and the Center for Social Justice, and increased resources for faculty and staff in his position.
O’Brien served as associate pastor at Holy Trinity Church in Washington, D.C., and taught philosophy and ethics at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia before arriving at Georgetown.  He holds a bachelor’s degree in government from Georgetown University, a Juris Doctor degree with honors from the University of Florida Levin College of Law, a master’s degree in philosophy from Fordham University and a licentiate in sacred theology and master of divinity degrees from the Weston Jesuit School of Theology.

Tensions flared among student groups invested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after the vandalism of a makeshift wall created by Georgetown’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine in the Intercultural Center Galleria on March 14.
The wall was put up during Israeli Apartheid Week, which is held in over 150 universities worldwide, and aimed at symbolizing the Israeli West Bank barrier while spotlighting alleged injustices associated with the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza strip.
In addition to the wall, SJP’s programming included events such as a “Faith Washing,” which combatted the view of the conflict as a religious issue, and a discussion on why the SJP uses the term “apartheid” to characterize Israeli settlement.
The defacement included marker etchings and messages over the newspaper clippings, flyers, statistics and photographs pinned to the wall, which was taken down Sunday. The perpetrators of the vandalism have not been identified as of press time. One featured the wall’s title scribbled over and replaced with “International Anti-Israel Week 2016.” Another message invoked a quote by former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, stating, “Peace will come when Arabs love their children more than they hate Jews.”
SJP Chair Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ’17) said she found the messages to be anti-Arab and verging on Islamophobic.
“We were shocked,” Abdelfadeel said. “This is a big issue — it’s bigger than any of us. We’ve done it multiple times in the past and on an annual basis, and we’ve heard from people but no one has ever gone so far as to vandalize our wall.”
The Georgetown University Police Department dispatched a criminal investigation unit to interview affiliated students, witnesses and suspects of the vandalism. GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said apprehended suspects could face criminal charges relating to property destruction and a referral to the Office of Student Conduct.
“Georgetown University is a place where this kind of activity really isn’t tolerated,” Gruber said. “We’re supposed to be a place where you’re allowed to express your feelings or your thoughts without somebody coming up and causing damage to that, so hopefully this was just an isolated incident.”
Assistant Director of Student Engagement Lauren Gagliardi spoke on behalf of the Center for Student Engagement and offered its support to the SJP following the vandalism.
“The university considers acts of hate and bias unacceptable and antithetical to its commitment to an inclusive and respectful community,” Gagliardi wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Georgetown Israel Alliance and J Street U Georgetown, both pro-Israel organizations, have condemned the vandalism of the SJP’s wall.
GIA President Daniel Silbert (COL ’18) said he found SJP’s display one-sided and divisive but emphasized that the GIA would never respond to provocative displays with vandalism.
“If I come face-to-face with whoever did this, I’d say what you did was wrong because you defaced another campus organization’s property, which is against campus rules. It’s disrespectful, but even furthermore, it’s a horrible representation of the pro-Israel community,” Silbert said. “That’s not what we stand for, and if you are upset by what’s being said on that wall, when you respond by writing on it and defacing it, you’re just bringing more attention to it and giving their baseless claims even more attention.”
Molly Wartenberg (SFS ’16), former co-chair and current treasurer of J Street, attributed the politically charged use of the term “apartheid” as fueling the tensions that resulted in the wall’s vandalism.
“One of my main oppositions to it is that it suggests Israel is this horrible apartheid state when there is a huge difference between Israel proper and the occupied territories of the West Bank. I just think glossing over it with one word removes all nuance from the conversation and is also just very inflammatory for everyone,” Wartenberg said.
SJP member Matt Martin (COL ’16) said the term aptly calls attention to the parallels between the colonial oppression of black South Africans and Palestinians.
“Apartheid is an Afrikaans word meaning ‘separateness,’ and that is exactly what is in Israel-Palestine today — separateness,” Martin said. “It’s explicit, and it’s in their laws that are often very discriminatory against Palestinians and all sort of things. It doesn’t seek to equate Israel with apartheid South Africa but to highlight similarities and to then provoke conversation and critical thinking.”
In response to Israel Apartheid Week, the GIA launched a campaign calling for increased dialogue with members of the SJP. Silbert argued the SJP’s anti-normalization policy, which argues that debates between the two sides should be resisted because the process legitimizes pro-Israel positions, has stifled dialogue.
“If their goal is to promote peace and a solution to the conflict in Israel, not talking to the other side, and saying you’re not going to talk to the other side, is never going to move towards peace. It’s just going to alienate people away from your cause,” Silbert said.
Abdelfadeel said the anti-normalization policy is rooted in the philosophical principle that pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian positions are not morally equivalent sides.
“Israel has exercised settler-colonial policies against the Palestinians who have suffered immensely under this, and we don’t think it’s fair and it’s actually really, really absurd for anyone to suggest that an occupied people negotiate or talk or dialogue with the occupier,” Abdelfadeel said.
In light of Israel Apartheid Week and the vandalism, Martin criticized the university’s response to the vandalism, claiming its lack of formal statement is an unwelcome sign of how seriously it considers the rights of student groups.
“I anticipate and hope that the university will be more outspoken about vandalism on campus and take the rights of student groups seriously no matter what views they represent,” Martin said.

Students, campus workers and community members came together in a demonstration to express solidarity with mistreated university workers in Red Square on Friday. The rally, which was led by the Georgetown Solidarity Committee, served as the concluding event in its first weeklong Work With Dignity Campaign.
The campaign was launched Tuesday by committee members who wrote an op-ed published in The Hoya on Friday, March 18 claiming the university undermined and violated the Just Employment Policy — established in 2005 to maintain fair labor practices and create a safe working environment — with its treatment of workers during Winter Storm Jonas in January.
During the storm, Georgetown administrators were accused of providing inadequate housing accommodations to university employees who remained on campus. Workers were given the choice of either staying on campus overnight until the storm passed or leaving with no payment until the university reopened.
Unable to lose hours and pay, many workers stayed overnight and slept on benches and floors in university buildings. According to some university workers, the only accommodations afforded to them were a trash bag, a blanket, a towel and a pillow.
On March 16, a group of students and members of the Work With Dignity Campaign delivered their demands to university administrators, including increasing university accountability, enforcing fair business practices, reforming hiring and staffing practices and treating workers with dignity and respect.
Along with the demands, the demonstrators delivered to university officials the same accommodation packages given to workers during the blizzard, including a trash bag filled with a blanket, a towel and a pillow.
During the Friday rally, three university workers gave their personal remarks and experiences working on campus. The workers included Clarence Wesley, a facilities management employee, Josh Armstead, an employee of O’Donovan Hall, and Esmeralda Huerta (SFS ’17), a student employee.
Wesley said it is important that community members come together to express solidarity with workers and to denounce the hostilities many employees have endured on behalf of the administration.
“Many of us [workers] are having the same difficulties. For example, I have been retaliated against for speaking out about discrimination and this is still an ongoing problem because the retaliation has still continued. I was put on administrative leave as a result of this retaliation,” Wesley said.
Upon his return, Wesley claims he was punished with extra work as a result. He emphasized the need for the community to stand together so every worker can demand dignity and respectful conditions without fear of repercussions.
“When I came back from administrative leave, I was given an extra building. Now, I’m taking care of five buildings. Most people take care of one or two buildings,” Wesley said. “It’s important that we stand together so that you know that you are not alone in this growing hostile working environment that has not happened in facilities before.”
Armstead said the lack of dignity and respect for one worker affects all workers at Georgetown. For Armstead, every employee and community member needs to contribute to the welfare of Georgetown’s employees.
“In essence, what happens when a worker is disrespected, or as I have heard, when we have workers sleeping in cots who have to be here to make sure that this university is up to par, and we have these workers sleeping on cots and working five buildings and being discriminated against, that affects us at Leo’s, that affects us at Hoya Court, that affects every worker, union and student alike because if it can happen to them, it can happen to us,” Armstead said.
Huerta, who serves as co-chair of the Office of Student Worker Advocacy, drew from her own experiences as the daughter of low-wage workers and discussed the conditions many Georgetown workers endure.
“The very same conditions that I saw my parents working in, I see people working in here,” Huerta said. “People being overworked, people being discriminated against, people being abused by their employers, but having to go through those jobs anyway because they have to support their families.”
As a student worker herself, Huerta said students have a responsibility to create change in the community as well as advocate for their own rights as workers.
“We reach out to student workers who are taking on-campus jobs, off-campus jobs and who don’t really realize that they have rights,” Huerta said. “We as students not only have a voice to make sure that things get changed, but we also have rights and have a stake in this fight.”
Following the rally in Red Square, Pamela Gonzalez (SFS ’17) and Kory Stuer (COL ’19) led a group of students and community members in a march to University President John J. DeGioia’s office and presented a board with reasons why Georgetown should care about its workers.
As of press time, the university has not provided a formal response to the written demands, though Chief of Staff of the Office of the President Joe Ferrara spoke with the demonstrators Friday and said he would present the demands to DeGioia.
Joseph Gomez (SFS ’19), a member of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee, outlined ways that both Georgetown administration and students could remedy the injustices against workers. He said there is a need for the administration to apply the community’s dedication to Jesuit values to its treatment of all employees.
“If Georgetown were to just follow the Jesuit values that are set forth in the Spirit of Georgetown, and then incorporate that with what was supposed to have been implemented in the Just Employment Policy, then that can easily remedy the situation that is occurring now within university workers,” Gomez said.
Gomez said he hopes students across campus will educate themselves on issues of workers’ rights in the future by simply getting to know workers on a more individual level through personal discussions and encounters.
“The most important thing for students is to get to know the workers. Get to know the workers that you’re around everyday. Talk to people in Leo’s. Talk to the people that clean the bathrooms in your dorms. They’re human beings and they want to share their stories,” Gomez said.

Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Chris Fisk (COL ’17) discussed their plans to address dining, campus planning, mental health and sexual assault at their swearing-in ceremony for Georgetown University Student Association president and vice president in Healy Hall on Saturday.
Khan and Fisk replace former GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16).
Rohan said Khan and Fisk are leading GUSA at a critical time.
“They’re entering in a critical position, in a critical year,” Rohan said during the swearing-in ceremony. “With campus planning coming up, this is probably going to be the most substantial and important year that student advocacy has experienced in God knows how long.”
Khan and Fisk have appointed seven deputy chiefs of staff and 19 policy team chairs who will work with senate co-chairs and policy team advocates to develop policy. Over 100 students applied for a position.
Last year’s executive had eight deputy chiefs of staff and 21 cabinet secretaries, with 123 students applying for a position in the executive cabinet and staff.
GUSA Chief of Staff Alex Bobroske (SFS ’17) said applicants seemed enthusiastic to play a role in developing student voice with GUSA’s new structure, where the senate and executive will work together in policy teams to develop policy.
“Something that came up a lot in applications, one of the questions we asked, was about with this restructuring happening what they thought GUSA should do and it could do to be more inclusive of campus and what ideas the applicants had,” Bobroske said in an interview with The Hoya. “There’s just an overwhelming enthusiasm for how restructuring gives so many more student voices to be in the room and actually participate.”
Khan said campus planning — specifically, campus maintenance — is in a particularly important phase.
“This is an important, pressing phase that we’re in, and deferred maintenance and housing renovations are something that we just really need to start pushing the university back on. We need to ensure that that is a priority for our students and that that happens,” Khan said during the swearing-in ceremony.
According to Khan, while the recent hiring of new Counseling and Psychiatric Services staff is positive news, more has to be done.
“The recent news of the addition of the new psychologists and new case worker in CAPS, that’s great, and I know I really commend everyone who’s put so much of their time into that,” Khan said. “But it’s important to keep that momentum going. There’s still a lot we need to do to improve the resources that we have on this campus.”
According to Fisk, the administration also plans to push for the creation of an LGBTQ living-learning community and the continued enforcement of the memorandum of understanding for sexual assault policy, to which they hope to add further points.
Fisk said it is time GUSA plays a more active role in the conversation about racial inclusivity on campus.
“So we commend DeGioia for the efforts he’s made to make race and racial injustice a larger conversation at Georgetown, but there’s much more to be had in that conversation and it’s about time GUSA steps up to play a more active role in that process so that we can have a more productive advocacy role this coming year with that,” Fisk said.
Fisk said GUSA wants to further increase dialogue about socio-economic inclusivity as well.
“I think that this should be a place that no matter how much money you have in your pocket, or whether your parents went to college or not, you should be able to be a Hoya to the best extent of your abilities, and I think that GUSA as an advocacy body should really want to make sure that is the fact and that is the case for every student here,” Fisk said.
According to Rohan, the university will face several challenges in the coming year, including issues related to club sports, facilities, maintenance and a lack of funding for an athletic trainer.
Rohan said administrators often try to find ways to avoid addressing student concerns.
“We have administrators trying to hide behind walls of, ‘This is all very complicated and you can’t understand,’” Rohan said.
Luther said he believes his and Rohan’s tenure has been a success, especially in the areas of mental health, sexual assault and campus planning.
According to Luther, it is GUSA’s job to advocate for students as much as possible to a bureaucratic administration.
“Bureaucracies exist to protect themselves,” Luther said. “And so no matter how friendly and how exasperated and frustrated they might seem trying to make your demands come true, ultimately it’s in their best interests to keep students an arm’s length away. So that’s what we have to do here, is to make sure that the student voice is being pushed through as far as it can be.”
Luther said GUSA has the ability to improve students’ lives, but that it needs to focus on what students care about to be effective.
“We’ve all been impacted in a lot of great ways by people I’ve never met, and we are all impacting people that we’re never going to meet in a lot of good ways,” Luther said. “But we need to make sure if it’s going to be successful, student’s need to be behind it, and they’re not going to be behind it if all they hear about is all the petty squabbling that goes on when we get into the minor nuances of the bylaws.”

The Metropolitan Police Department’s policy allowed officers to obtain search warrants for raids conducted between 2013 and 2015 based solely on officers’ training and experience, according to a study by The Washington Post and American University’s Investigative Reporting Workshop published March 5.
The Fourth Amendment prohibits “unreasonable searches,” which is generally interpreted to mean that police and government agents may only obtain a warrant from a judge after demonstrating probable cause to search a location for a specific item. However, in the warrants, MPD officers only cited their general “training and experience” investigating the drug trade as grounds for raids, without providing physical evidence or observation of criminal activity at a particular residence.
The report reviewed 2,000 warrants issued between January 2013 and January 2015 and found that in 284 cases, officers were able to search a residence after arresting the presumed owner for possession of drugs or guns without any evidence to support the raid besides their training and experience.
In 115 of the 284 cases, corresponding to around 40 percent, officers found nothing at the residences they raided. The remaining 60 percent of raids uncovered illegal items including weapons and drug paraphernalia. The warrants investigated in the report extended police jurisdiction in cases involving drugs and guns, allowing for the seizure of phones, computers and personal records.
Katherine Hubbard, a litigation fellow at Equal Justice Under Law – a D.C.-based non-profit civil rights organization that has filed lawsuits challenging the training and experience justification for obtaining warrants – said officers did not take all the necessary steps to acquire a warrant.
The Metropolitan Police Department’s policy allowed officers to obtain search warrants for raids conducted between 2013 and 2015 based solely on officers’ training and experience, according to a study by The Washington Post and American University’s Investigative Reporting Workshop published March 5.
The Fourth Amendment prohibits “unreasonable searches,” which is generally interpreted to mean that police and government agents may only obtain a warrant from a judge after demonstrating probable cause to search a location for a specific item. However, in the warrants, MPD officers only cited their general “training and experience” investigating the drug trade as grounds for raids, without providing physical evidence or observation of criminal activity at a particular residence.
The report reviewed 2,000 warrants issued between January 2013 and January 2015 and found that in 284 cases, officers were able to search a residence after arresting the presumed owner for possession of drugs or guns without any evidence to support the raid besides their training and experience.According to Hubbard, instead of simply invoking their training and experience, officers should first conduct an investigation that uncovers reasonable evidence.
“It’s our position that that practice is illegal,” Hubbard said. “The Fourth Amendment requires that in order to search someone’s home you need probable cause. There’s a fairly high standard, it’s saying that you need evidence that shows a probability that the things you’re seeking are likely to be found.”
MPD has defended the practice, stating that each search warrant goes through a rigorous review process by prosecutors and a judge to ensure probable cause and constitutionality.
MPD Chief Cathy Lanier said the warrants were constitutional and helped diminish criminal activity that may not otherwise have been discovered.
“In the vast majority of those warrants, contraband and evidence was recovered in furtherance of criminal prosecutions, and gave MPD the ability to bring closure to multiple victims of crimes in our city,” Lanier wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “During that same time frame, MPD received very few complaints regarding the execution of those warrants.”
According to the report, almost 99 percent of the 276 raids in which a suspect’s race was stated occurred in the homes of African Americans. Hubbard pointed to this racial and socio-economic component as indicative of a larger pattern in police practices.
“I don’t think anyone could imagine these searches happening in the Northwest with police conducting violent raids of people’s homes based on very little evidence,” Hubbard said. “These searches are targeting black families and families who don’t have the resources to put up a big fight against this tactic.”
However, Lanier stated that the MPD does not target any particular community, stressing the department’s dedication to fair policing.
“As with any interaction between the police and a resident or visitor in D.C., if someone is not satisfied with the police service they have received or the actions of one of our members, I encourage them to immediately contact the MPD and speak with a supervisor or the Office of Police Complaints regarding the incident so the matter can be investigated,” Lanier wrote in her statement to The Hoya. “We remain committed to unbiased constitutional policing.”
Institute of Criminal Law and Procedure Co-Director at Georgetown University Law Center William McDonald said it is important to take into account the historical context of obtaining warrants based on training and experience when determining the constitutionality of searches.
McDonald cited the 1968 Supreme Court case Terry v. Ohio, in which the Supreme Court ruled that, if a police officer has reasonable suspicion based on experience that a suspect has or will commit a crime, the officer has the authority to stop and frisk a citizen without probable cause to arrest.
“There was no reasonable standard to make you think a crime had been committed,” McDonald said. “So, the court said, it was an experienced police officer, he observed this pattern of behavior and that gave him reasonable suspicion to go up and stop the man.”
However, McDonald stated that even with experience, officers still must have reasonable suspicion, and expressed doubt that this was the case in some of the raids reviewed.
“It’s up then to the courts to decide whether or not to let them do that or to put limits on the expansion of those powers,” McDonald said. “The powers they’ve managed to create for themselves using that logic strike me as pretty broad.”
Hubbard noted that the seven lawsuits Equal Justice Under Law has filed to challenge police officers’ use of their training and experience have been moving slowly through the courts. D.C. has filed motions to dismiss the cases and for six of the seven, judges’ decisions on whether or not to do so are still forthcoming.
“We’re waiting for rulings on the motions to dismiss,” Hubbard said. “Once we get those we’ll move into the discovery phase where we’ll get more information about these practices.”
McDonald said that by continuing to stretch the limits regarding MPD raids, police officers lose legitimacy and authority in the neighborhoods where searches are taking place. According to McDonald, the police should take into account how its mistakes, such as raiding the wrong house, will be viewed by the public at large.
“That’s the fear behind letting police practice a policy that’s going to annoy the hell out of communities that are already disadvantaged and could explode,” McDonald said. “That’s how I see this, that what needs to be done with regard to this particular policy is rethinking those policies and recognizing what’s in the balance.”

Former Republican presidential candidate Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) discussed his experiences running for president and his views on liberal values at an event hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service as part of its “Reflections on Running” series in Old North on Monday.
GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee moderated the discussion, which was attended by over 70 people. Elleithee previously spent nearly two decades working as a communication specialist for the Democratic Party.
Santorum began his career working for former Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.) during his time at the Dickinson School of Law from 1983 to 1986 and acted as the Pennsylvania Senate’s local government committee director from 1981 to 1984. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, before becoming a senator in 1994. He served two terms until losing his re-election bid in 2006.
Santorum said he first ran for Congress in a tough election cycle but, despite the odds, won by sticking to his principles and working hard. Santorum specifically pointed to the lack of support and funding he received from political action committees and the Republican National Committee.
“I got no support from anybody. I got no PAC money, no support from the RNC, no support from the congressional committee,” Santorum said. “I just decided that you had to go out and stand for what you believe in. I went there, and I figured I’m going to do the right thing and just spend my two years and then go do something else.”
In his 2012 presidential election, Santorum lost the Republican nomination to former governor Mitt Romney (R-Mass.). He ran again for president during the 2016 primaries, earning only a fraction of the support he enjoyed four years ago.
After withdrawing his candidacy for the nomination Feb. 3, Santorum endorsed Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who later also dropped out on March 16.
Santorum highlighted Donald Trump’s divisive politics and rhetoric as a clever political strategy.
“He’s good at angry. He’s good at blaming folks. In my own opinion, he did what Barack Obama and the Democrats did very well,” Santorum said. “They segment the population, and they try to maximize the votes from different groups of people.”
Despite this, Santorum said he would support the Republican nominee, even if it turns out to be Trump.
“I will vote for whoever the Republican nominee is,” Santorum said. “To the extent that I can, I will try to help him.”
Following Elleithee and Santorum’s conversation, audience members were given the opportunity to ask the senator questions.
Responding to an inquiry about same-sex marriage legalization, Santorum expressed vehement opposition, stating that the law could set a precedent for the legalization of other sexual relations.
“How do you say that two men can marry, two women can marry, but three can’t?” Santorum said.
Santorum took issue with the ability of the Supreme Court to approve laws that could potentially be implemented without restriction, comparing this to Congress’ more limited legislative powers.
“When the Court passes a law, which is what they did, it is a broad sweeping right that has legal reasoning and ramifications that flow from it, whereas when the Congress says here is what it is and there’s nothing more than that, we can limit it. Courts can’t limit. And that is the problem with courts doing this,” Santorum said. “They open up Pandora’s box.”
Santorum also discussed the implications of a liberal Supreme Court, a possibility in light of President Barack Obama’s recent nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the court. Santorum said it would result in the importation of secular, European values.
“It is a completely secular society where man establishes rights and rules and so my point is, what the Supreme Court will do, is adopt European style rights and import them into America,” Santorum said. “What is Europe doing except being co-opted, corrupted and displaced now by immigrants who have a fundamentally different culture than they do and they don’t even have the courage to fight on that? Europe is dying. They’re dying. They’re not leading. They’re not fighting for anything or against anybody other than just to keep their stuff.”
Santorum warned the audience that the United States could share what he viewed as Europe’s disastrous fate if a more liberal culture finds a national foothold.
“This place will die and become just like Europe,” Santorum said.
Roey Hadar (SFS ’17) said he respected Santorum’s principled outlook but said he found it difficult to listen to the senator’s statements during the question and answer session.
“In the Q&A portion, Santorum just used such inflammatory rhetoric, some logical fallacies, so much over the top rhetoric that it was hard to sustain the previously gained respect that I had before,” Hadar said.
Ellie Singer (COL ’18), who identifies as a Republican, shared Hader’s sentiments and said, while Santorum provided valuable insight, his rhetoric was problematic.
“I think it was really valuable to hear Santorum’s opinions, and it’s difficult to push past the inflammatory rhetoric to get to the conservative principles that will actually bring our country together,” Singer said.
Amy Qin, a student from the University of Chicago who attended the event, said she did not agree with Santorum’s views on immigration and felt he was unfairly targeting certain groups, which made her uncomfortable.
“He was making kind of a personal attack on the people in this room,” Qin said regarding her perception that Santorum specifically directed his rhetoric at minority audience members. “I really felt he was singling out a lot of immigrants.”

Student athletes frustrated with Kehoe Field’s potential eight-to-15-year closure have created a petition urging the administration to expedite the rehabilitation process. Kehoe Field’s closure has consequently forced club sports, intramural sports and recreational activities onto one field: Cooper Field.
The administration decided to close Kehoe Field on Feb. 2 because of safety concerns posed by the deterioration of the field. Varsity athletes have not used Kehoe Field in 10 years because of the field’s poor condition.
“There are divots; there are mounds; there are seams that have come apart, and it’s just not very safe up there,” Director of Yates Field House Jim Gilroy said.
Dan Zager (COL ’18), a member of the men’s club Frisbee Team, said he is frustrated at the university’s slow response to repairing Kehoe Field, citing the practical inconvenience it confers on club and intramural sports.
“I think Kehoe is definitely necessary because we have so many club sports on campus and so many intramural sports, and we need more field space. To narrow usable field space down to Cooper Field is a joke for a university of this size,” Zager said.
Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Todd Olson said the administration has worked hard to make other facilities available to the best of their ability, by opening up evening times of Cooper Field for club sports and intramural teams as well as allowing students to practice on weeknights at Francis Park, located on 22nd and M St NW, and Mitchell Park, located at 1801 23rd St NW, and Sundays at Georgetown Day School. The Intramural Softball program is using Shaw Field for games during the spring semester.
As of press time, no shuttles are being provided to the fields.
“We continue to work actively to identify available nearby recreation facilities where students can have access to practice time,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
James McGrath (COL ’17), chair of the Advisory Board for Club Sports and who was involved in putting together the petition, said only securing off-campus practice space is not satisfactory.
“We put the petition together because we want the university to hear from student voices that Kehoe cannot sit unused and in disrepair for the next decade. Club athletes, intramural participants and just anyone who wants to be active at Georgetown has a stake in the future of Kehoe,” McGrath said. “We just want the administration to know that although we are working to secure off-campus practice space for our teams, we will not be able to continue the success of club sports at Georgetown with Kehoe closed for the next eight to 15 years.”
The current campus plan, which begins in 2017 and extends until 2037, would entail building a new athletics center where Shaw Field is currently and then tearing down the current Yates building, which would create space for new fields.
According to Vice President for Facilities and Operations Robin Morey, the university is still deciding whether it will repair the current Kehoe Field while awaiting the creation of a new athletics center.
“Over the next year, we are exploring the feasibility of a new Yates vs. the replacement of the Yates roof. This work requires engagement of our planners, engineers, city and community partners to vet program requirements, zoning requirements, economic impacts and mission accommodation” Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Gilroy said he would like to see Kehoe Field repaired while University President John J. DeGioia and the board of directors decide on the next major fundraising project, although he said he thinks it is unlikely the university will spend the necessary money to repair Kehoe in the interim.
“I think the facilities administration feel that it’s not worth it because of the cost,” Gilroy said. “I think that the estimated cost would be between $7.5 and $10 million to fix it, and that would mean just ripping up everything that’s up there, cleaning off the roof, making any repairs that need to be made, and then waterproofing the roof and then putting on the different layers needed to go on for a new synthetic field.”
Students petitioning for a repair to Kehoe Field echoed Gilroy’s sentiment, saying that it is worthwhile and necessary to repair Kehoe Field regardless of whether or not a new recreational center becomes the university’s next major project because the completion of a new facility is so far down the road.
Gilroy said he hopes a petition could make the administration listen.
“I would like to think that if several thousand students made it clear that this is really important to them that maybe somebody in the administration will listen,” Gilroy said.
Olson said the administration is happy to work with the Advisory Board for Club Sports as it seeks a suitable solution for all parties involved.
“I am happy to meet with the Advisory Board for Club Sports to discuss the concerns raised in the petition.  I will be reaching out to them very soon,” Olson said.

The Washington, D.C., Republican primary culminated in a victory for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) after local Republicans took to Loews Madison Hotel to vote March 12.
Despite his win in the District, Rubio suspended his presidential campaign March 16 after losing the primary in his home state of Florida to Donald Trump.
The D.C. primary is potentially the city’s most important in years as a step in building momentum for candidates other than Trump, who leads in numerous other states but lacks strong support in the District. The primary also allocated the city’s 19 delegates earlier than in years past, giving D.C. voters an opportunity to make more of an impact in the nomination process.
The District is largely Democratic, with only six percent of the city identifying as Republican.
Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service spring fellow Katie Packer, former deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, stressed D.C.’s importance in this particular election.
“Typically D.C. has fallen too late to make a difference,” Packer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This year all states matter. And if it comes down to a delegate battle on the floor every set of delegates will matter.”
The four candidates still in the race prior to the D.C. primary — Rubio, Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Governor John Kasich (R-Ohio) — competed for 19 delegates, 16 of whom were allocated proportionally to candidates who gained more than 15 percent of votes. The remaining three delegates were allocated though plurality to the candidate who received the majority of votes.
Rubio, who amassed 37.3 percent of votes, earned 10 delegates while Kasich trailed closely behind with 35.5 percent of votes, receiving nine delegates.
Trump and Cruz received substantially less support, with 13.8 and 12.4 percent of the vote each. Neither secured delegates from the District. Others on the ballot, who amassed under one percent of the votes, include former candidate Ben Carson, former Governor Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).
Packer attributed the increased support for Rubio in the area to D.C.’s demographic makeup, citing the District’s entirely urban location and its residents’ high overall level of education.
“D.C. is more like a big city than a state. Most states have cities where Rubio did well. Others have done better in rural areas. D.C. doesn’t have suburbs or small towns. So it was tailor made for Rubio,” Packer wrote. “The D.C. electorate is far more educated than other places. He wasn’t really competing with either Cruz or Trump there. He had the field to himself and was far more organized than anyone else here.”
The 2016 primary also saw less overall participation with 2,839 voters compared to 2012, in which nearly 6,000 voters cast their ballots. Party leaders attributed the decline in turnout to the constraints of having a single downtown location for Republican voters to cast their ballots rather than several locations spread throughout the District.
Georgetown Students for Rubio board member Alexandra Williams (SFS ’19) highlighted Rubio’s success in Washington, D.C., as an indication of a politically inclined voting population.
“I was overjoyed that Rubio won something. None of us with the campaign were surprised with the result though because he had performed so well in Northern Virginia,” Williams said. “Voters in D.C. are less inclined to be swayed by demagoguery.”
Georgetown Students for Rubio board member Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) agreed that voters in the District show uniqueness in their experience and exposure to the political climate. Estes further underscored D.C.’s unique position as the center of the nation’s politics as a factor in its propensity to favor establishment candidates such as Rubio and Kasich.
“I think the majority of Republicans who live in D.C. are Capitol Hill staffers, pundits, journalists and other politically minded workers,” Estes said. “The people showing up to vote were not ones who were won over by the messages of Trump or Cruz. Those two candidates have waged war on the Beltway class, and in this primary we saw that very class naturally rejecting them in favor of more establishment-oriented candidates.”
Estes emphasized the importance of Rubio’s win, despite the former candidate’s decision to suspend his campaign.
“We were very excited to have seen the results coming out of D.C. In this race we knew that every delegate was going to count heading into the convention. And every win is important for the sake of momentum,” Estes said. “We hoped that what we saw in D.C. would correlate into a national trend in the upcoming primaries as well. However, that didn’t manifest itself, unfortunately.”
Though Estes expressed pride in Rubio’s District victory, he also articulated the disappointment Rubio supporters feel in light of the presidential contender’s decision to withdraw from the race.
“Without a doubt I strongly believe that Rubio would have been one of the greatest presidents we would ever have. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem that his time has come in this cycle,” Estes said. “But he’s a young man with a bright future, and I looked forward to the incredible things he will do with his time moving forward. I fully believe that one day Marco Rubio will be our president, and I will be honored once again to stand with him then.”
Williams echoed Estes’ sentiments, speculating some Rubio supporters may disengage from the 2016 election process as a whole.
“Now the GOP is left with a field of uninspiring, pessimistic candidates. Many Rubio supporters feel lost now, with no choice but to abstain from voting due to a lack of any reasonable or desirable candidate whose values align with theirs,” Williams said.

While student advocates dispute the current university contract with Nike, Inc., former Nike garment worker and union president Noi Supalai described her struggle to receive fair wages at an event in the Reiss Science Building on Friday. The 44-year-old mother of two came to Georgetown from her home in Northern Thailand as part of a nationwide tour with the United Students Against Sweatshops, a national student-advocacy group.
Cosponsored by the Women and Gender Studies, Theology and Justice and Peace Studies programs, Wearable Justice and the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor, the talk comes after Athletes and Advocates for Worker’s Rights began speaking out against Nike’s alleged unethical business practices in Nov. 2015.
Through an interpreter, Supalai explained she worked at various industrial positions until joining an Eagle Speed Marketing Co. Ltd. factory in Thailand in 2008.
The factory employed about 2,000 workers and formed contracts with brands such as Nike, Columbia Sportswear and The North Face to produce jackets primarily for European and American buyers.
Supalai worked at a sewing machine to assemble jacket pieces from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m., with a one-hour lunch break at noon. The factory provided lunch and paid Supalai the equivalent of $4 or $5 per day, plus voluntary overtime. For Supalai, the initial wage was reasonable.
However, when Nike requested a large order in 2009, the factory increased worker hours until midnight — sometimes even to sunrise — with minimal breaks.
After working to the brink of exhaustion, the workers found they did not receive their monthly paychecks and began negotiating unsuccessfully with their employer, who explained they could not pay the workers until Nike paid their order.
Without wages, workers could not pay for rent, electricity, running water or food. In response, the factory workers formed a union and elected Supalai president, eventually appealing directly to Nike for help in claiming their wages.
Supalai recounted that, after Nike representatives assured the union they would meet with Eagle Speed managers, the company retracted its orders from the factory instead.Full-time employee of USAS Morgan Currier described that “cutting and running” is an unethical practice in which companies contract with factories abroad but remove orders from firms where workers protest for wage increases and other improvements to pursue lower prices.
“When workers try to form a union, they have power. Brands don’t like that, especially brands like Nike,” Currier said. “So what they’ll do is they’ll up and move their production to a different factory, likely somewhere that has even less regulation.”
Through her experience with negotiations, Supalai argued Nike emphasizes monetary gain over human quality of life.
“They don’t care what they leave behind, our working conditions or the conditions of the workers or what would happen to the factory,” Supalai said. “The only thing they care about is their products and their profits.”
Supalai’s union received compensation for missed wages as well as improved working conditions, including higher quality lunches following joint negotiations with their employer and the Worker Rights Consortium, an independentlabor rights-monitoring organization co-founded by Georgetown in 2000.Nike did not respond to a request for comment. The company has received negative media coverage over worker abuse in its factories since the 1990s.
In 1999, Nike created the Fair Labor Association, an independent monitoring organization auditing Nike-contracted factories for labor violations, to address worker maltreatment issues.
Given Nike’s prominent position within the FLA, Supalai said she does not trust the association.
“There must be an independent organization which monitors a company of Nike so that they can be more responsible to their production line,” Supalai said.
Currently, most major university-affiliated apparel brands including Adidas and Alta Gracia have agreed to the Code of Conduct and thereby apply “adequate monitoring methods,” typically including WRC inspections. Nike has not agreed to the Code of Conduct.
Cal Watson, the Chair of the Georgetown Licensing and Oversight Committee, which advises the university administration in promoting ethical business practices, said a phone meeting with Nike on Monday addressing this exception will allow the committee to deliberate and advise university administration on the issue.
LOC member professor John Kline — who supported Alta Gracia and contributed to a report researching the company’s fair business practices in 2014 — said Nike should be made to sign the code and agree to additional monitoring or forfeit its licensing agreement with Georgetown.
“If Nike refuses to sign the same contract that everyone else does and refuses to be committed to following our Code of Conduct, I will not support any continuation of Nike as a licensee,” Kline said.
Isabelle Teare (COL ’17), a student athlete and co-leader of Athletes and Advocates who coordinated the event, said the event’s result met her expectations.
“I think we had a really good turnout, and I think people walked away with an increased understanding and interest in the issue,” Teare said.
Sophie Kershaw (COL ’18), a student athlete and activist who attended the event, said she hopes students will promote the WRC in monitoring brands like Nike producing garments for the university. She argued that, if students become more aware of WRC’s goals and efforts, more positive progress will occur.
“Small steps like [promoting] the WRC [can help] — these are the people who know the issue and are doing the right thing — so if we can try to find a way to help in that pursuit, that’s the best we can do,” Kershaw said.

Founder and Editor-in-chief of news site Vox.com Ezra Klein emphasized the long-lasting implications of the current election cycle on the U.S. political environment during a discussion held in Copley Formal Lounge on Thursday.
The event, hosted by the Georgetown Lecture Fund and co-sponsored by The Hoya and The Georgetown Voice, was the seventh Annual Michael Jurist Memorial Lecture honoring the memory of former Lecture Fund Chair Michael Jurist (SFS ’07) and saw a turnout that filled the room.
Vox.com is a news site owned by the Vox Media Company. Established in 2014, it is dedicated to explaining and clarifying news and daily issues. During its first month, it received over five million unique visitors. Today it reaches over 23 million unique visitors per month.
The Georgetown Voice Editor-in-chief Daniel Varghese (SFS ’17) introduced Klein and praised him for the large amount of articles he has contributed to Vox, despite his position as the editor-in-chief. Klein then began by stating how the original intent of his speech was to discuss policymaking in Washington, but he had decided to focus on the pressing issue of the current state of U.S. politics during this election cycle.
“I think this has become a pretty dark time in American politics, and I think it requires people to think a little differently — for me to think a little different than I have in years,” Klein said.
The subject of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s success in the primaries was a theme of the lecture, though Klein made it clear he did not believe Trump would win the presidency.
Klein said Trump’s rise brings to light some of the weak points of the U.S. political system.
“What we are seeing here is that our institutions are not as strong as we think, at least not right now,” Klein said.
Citing both Bernie Sanders’ and Trump’s candidacies as examples, Klein said the current two-party system has silenced some beliefs held by the population, which has contributed to the rise in popularity of Trump and Sanders.
“I think something we see with Bernie Sanders, but more so with Donald Trump, is there are ideological equilibriums that are suppressed by our political system,” Klein said. “What Donald Trump has done in the Republican Party specifically is to develop and sharpen a tendency he already knew was there.”
Klein said Trump’s success is emblematic of a larger trend and should not be dismissed as a fluke.
“What Trump has done is to scramble these position spaces, and in doing he has found something really powerful. It would be a mistake to see him as a one-off phenomena,” Klein said.
Klein said media bias is not ideological, but rather bias towards sensationalism and ratings. He further asserted Trump is a mastermind at using existing media bias to his advantage.
“All of the coverage would have naturally started going to Ted Cruz, because what you do in the media is when someone else begins to lead in the polls, is that you begin vetting them,” Klein said. “Donald Trump wrenched all that coverage back to him.”
Klein said another issue with the current political environment is the amount of polarization present in both Democrats and Republicans. When both parties become more extreme, Klein argued, individuals are more likely to support their party’s nominee.
“Now the stakes are higher. Even if you don’t like the person your party has chosen, voting for them is still the rational choice,” Klein said.
As the speech drew to a close, Klein discussed the effects of online media and how it fuels polarization. He warned that the Internet tailors news outlets and search results to match one’s ideology, leading to the creation of an echo chamber without opposing views.
“You can find yourself only absorbing news from outlets that agree with you,” Klein said. “The result is an atmosphere of fear, of mistrust and concern that leads people to feel that the stakes are much higher than ever.”
Klein stressed the importance of not becoming complacent and for citizens to play an active role to protect the American political system.
“We have to protect our democracy, we have to protect our political system, we have to protect our freedoms, in this era as much as we have in any other era,” Klein said. “We don’t get to take it for granted. Every generation doesn’t get to decide that the last generation has truly vanquished the demons.”
Grace Smith (COL ’18), who attended the event, said she enjoyed Klein’s speech and appreciated the diverse perspectives he brought forth.
“I think he is incredibly intelligent, and I definitely really appreciate the lecture fund for taking the time to have someone who so well-versed in these issues come here,” Smith said.
Jonny Amon (MSB ’19) said he found the discussion interesting, especially when it came to Klein’s analysis of Trump and his campaign.
“I thought it was really cool to see his perspective and like how he pushes out what he thinks and hearing him talk about Donald Trump in particular and other political candidates,” Amon said.

The Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results Act — which aims to reduce crime in the District — is currently undergoing final review by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser after receiving unanimous approval from the D.C. Council in its second reading.
Bowser has until March 25 to respond to and allow for the implementation of the bill, which seeks to support at-risk or dangerous individuals and to treat crime in the District as a public health issue.
At the council’s most recent legislative meeting March 1, NEAR Act sponsor Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5) said the bill would take a major step toward a more effective approach to District crime.
“Today the council is poised to pass a comprehensive, evidence-based criminal justice reform measure,” McDuffie said. “In so doing we will be fundamentally rethinking how we approach violent crime in the District of Columbia.”
There were multiple amendments made to the bill during its second reading, which came nearly a month after its Feb. 2 first reading. The first amendment, made by McDuffie, seeks to create a fund for the proposed Office of Neighborhood Engagement and Security, the centerpiece program of the NEAR Act. The program will identify individuals at risk of committing crimes and teach them life planning and mentorship skills.
The fund McDuffie established aims to combine public money provided by the District as well as private donations. The need for private donations arose after D.C. Chief Financial Officer Jeffery Dewitt stated D.C. would not have a sufficient budget to completely fund the office until at least 2017.
McDuffie argued that the current criminal justice system’s failures led to the need to create the new office.
“This council has recognized that the approach to which we have so desperately clung, built off of incarceration, does not work. In fact, it contributes to whole communities going missing, lost to a system over which the District government has little oversight or input,” McDuffie said. “It tears apart families and neighborhoods, and it irreparably harms our children.”
McDuffie additionally amended the bill to keep the personal information of at-risk individuals participating in the office’s programs from becoming public information.
McDuffie’s addendum also included language from the Washington, D.C. city code, explicitly stating that if an individual is charged with assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest cannot be used as a legitimate justification. This seeks to limit the use of force against police officers, as multiple councilmembers have expressed concerns about the bill’s attempts to constrain the Metropolitan Police Department’s use of force in arrests.
Councilmember LaRuby May (D-Ward 8) proposed an additional amendment to the bill to create a voucher program for businesses participating in the Act’s Private Security Camera System Incentive Program. The program would provide rebates for establishments that install exterior security cameras.
According to May, her amendment would ask the District to pay up front the $500 needed for the private security programs for low-income businesses in order to minimize the financial impact.
“That payment can prevent people in areas of desperate need for crime prevention tactics from obtaining this resource,” May wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This Amendment to the NEAR Act ensures that private security cameras are accessible to all residents, especially those in high crime and low-income areas.”
Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) introduced an additional amendment to the act that would give the Pretrial Services Agency the ability to initiate a process of holding an individual charged with a crime for up to 72 hours. The agency is an independent federal body that makes release recommendations for defendants awaiting trial. Currently, only District courts and the Washington, D.C., District Attorney’s Office holds the authority cited by the amendment.
Mendelson cited the inefficiency and potential danger of releasing suspects prematurely as a major concern prompting the addendum.
“Typically, a person who is released pending trial is released on the condition that they don’t reoffend, and sometimes they do, and that’s what this speaks to,” Mendelson said at the meeting. “We see that over and over.”
Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber expressed support for the bill as a creative way of reducing crime in Washington. Gruber was especially supportive of Mendelson’s amendment to hold those accused of a crime for longer periods.
“I think the bill is a good step in getting a handle on city crime. Sometimes you need to try different things to get different results,” Gruber said. “The amendment made by Councilmember Mendelson should be considered and given a chance to see if it works.”

Kareem Chehayeb and Sarah Shmaitilly, the founders of Beirut Syndrome, a grassroots journalism site based in Beirut, Lebanon, discussed the tendency of the Lebanese media to censor their reporting in an effort to maintain the country’s reputation at a panel discussion in Reiss Hall on Wednesday.
Chehayeb and Shmaitilly said the idea behind their site is to report on Lebanese issues from an alternative perspective, seeking to counteract Lebanese censorship on their website with clear, unbiased content.
“We try to take what people are talking about and are passionate about and find a different angle to report from,” Chehayeb said.
The pair said Lebanese people can become desensitized to the disasters and warfare that affect their nation. Chehayeb and Shmaitilly blame Lebanese media companies’ for this disinterest, claiming these companies intentionally portray a clean and peaceful image of their country to encourage investment in their economy by foreigners and wealthy expatriates.
Chehayeb and Shmaitilly also said many people in Lebanon are afraid to speak openly about controversial events, for fear of prosecution by their government — something their website hopes to change.
“We want to create safe spaces online for conversations to take place,” Shamitilly said.
The pair spent most of their time describing the events they have covered in the past few years, including the arrival of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, real estate takeovers that involved the destruction of cultural heritage sites and the Lebanese government’s careful management of religious sects.
Chehayeb and Shmaitilly also gave examples of how the mainstream press attempted to censor reporting on these events.
Chehayeb and Shmaitilly particularly pointed to the controversy of the military in Lebanon.
“The tricky thing about Lebanon when compared to other Arab countries is that in Lebanon you have multiple political parties that have existed for decades and decades, and they switch alliances here and there, so the only body people see as trustworthy and constant is the army, because it is by the state and for the state,” Chehayb said.
Chehayeb and Shmaitilly said that many Lebanese people see the police force, not the army, as the agent of censorship and brutality. The Lebanese police force, ISF, has recently been using social media to post photos of instances of their officers helping children, which Chehayeb and Shmaitilly displayed during the panel.
The pair also said that Beirut Syndrome and its reporters cannot become a licensed media outlet and are therefore subject to immediate arrest.
“There is a limited number of media licenses given out by the government and all of those have been given to the mainstream, commercial media companies,” Chehayeb said.
Chehayeb and Shmaitilly said they hope to avoid the sponsorships and commercialization which have corrupted the mainstream media in Lebanon.
“So many people’s problems are not even talked about in the local media because it’s not sexy or attractive enough, it doesn’t make Lebanon look good and we want to make things better for everybody,” Chehayeb said.

Dior Vargas, a Latina Feminist Mental Health Activist, addressed some of the difficulties and stigmas that surround communities of color when confronted with issues of mental illness during an event in Copley Formal Lounge on Feb. 29.
The event, hosted and facilitated by Bianca Uribe (COL ’18) and Xiomara Salazar (SFS ’18) of the Student of Color Alliance and Center for Multicultural Equity & Access, outlined the unique struggles of many students of color concerning mental illness at Georgetown University and other universities around the country.
The dialogue aimed to identify cultural and institutional issues and solutions that Georgetown, other universities and members of the community could implement in order to remedy these problems.
Vargas named the failure to discuss mental health within communities of color, which can make people struggling with these issues feel scared and vulnerable, as a central issue.
“It’s something where we don’t want to talk about it at all. There’s no mention of it,” Vargas said.
Uribe said students of color encounter complex obstacles in trying to find resources to cope with mental illness.
“It’s really hard to find mental health resources, no matter what your background is, but with students of color, there’s a whole other spectrum of things that, for some reason, a lot of us don’t see, that’s being ignored,” Uribe said.
According to Vargas, being a student of color intersects with other characteristics, including class, which may contribute to a lack of available resources.
“A lot of us are immigrants. A lot of us are lower-class or lower-income,” Vargas said. “Many of these students are first generation students, and that carries a lot of pressure. There’s the lack of money that they have to pay for counselors that might work within the institution and also the ones that might be off campus.”
Vargas, who created the People of Color Mental Illness Photo Project, consisting of photos of people of color with mental illnesses to combat the media’s lack of representation of such groups, said there is a lack of diversity and representation of people of color when talking about issues of mental illness.
“A lot of students of color, when they’re entering into a space of higher education, they’re usually the minority, and they feel uncomfortable seeking help and reaching out to people,” Vargas said. “There’s also a lack of understanding that a lot of students in intensive institutions are pretty homogenous.”
According to Vargas, mental health professionals who work with students of color also tend to be white and upper-middle-class. Vargas said this lack of diversity contributes to challenges in patient retention.
“It’s important to see a familiar face, and it’s important to have someone who can understand you and speak your language,” Vargas said.
One of the policies Vargas said has significantly improved mental health support systems in other universities is the implementation of mental health training programs for all campus employees, including campus police, faculty, staff and Resident Advisors.
“In terms of what’s happening on other campuses, engraining training programs has been very important and successful,” Vargas said. “It’s important that everyone has that training so that they can be ready to support students.”
Vargas said it’s important that universities not let a lack of resources prevent them from introducing mental health programs.
“Creating spaces focused solely on mental health and allocating resources to them is important. I understand that these things cost money, but I think there are ways to do it,” Vargas said.
