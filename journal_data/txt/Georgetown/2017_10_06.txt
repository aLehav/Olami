Like many Georgetown University students, Teodora Lancaster (COL ’20) expected her time on the Hilltop to be a balancing act of classes, internships, healthy social outings and sightseeing.
But just over a year into her time at Georgetown, Lancaster is coming to understand the severe constraints imposed by her financial situation.
“There had been a good amount of times where I wondered if I belonged here. At times, I felt out of place because a lot of students on this campus have money and make sure that you know it,” Lancaster said.
Having grown up in southern California as the youngest of five children, Lancaster said her single mother struggled financially while raising her. Working on and off during Lancaster’s childhood, her mother endured financial strains due to her children’s education bills and her late husband’s medical expenses.
Lancaster remembers a time during her freshman spring semester when the cost of academic materials and stress pushed her to a breaking point.
“I was tackling two jobs and five classes. Two of my courses were extremely difficult for me and although I sought out help from the free resources offered on campus, it wasn’t enough,” Lancaster said. “I also did not have enough money to purchase all the necessary textbooks that I needed so I struggled to keep up because I didn’t even have a book to refer to.”
Lancaster was juggling a front desk assistant work-study job at the Georgetown University Medical Center while volunteering for Jumpstart, a national early education organization that aims to provide children from low-income families with tutoring and emotional support. But her work-study job prevented her from receiving an income at Jumpstart, forcing her to work 300 hours over 26 weeks last semester to win an educational grant of $1,221 from Jumpstart to pay off part of her student loan.
“It sucked because it would take time away from my studies, but I would say, ‘I need to work towards this time because I need to get this amount of hours to get the money I need to pay off my loan,’” Lancaster said.
She is not alone. Lancaster represents a larger group of students on campus who need greater institutional and financial support but were not granted entry to the university’s largest resource for financially disadvantaged students, the Georgetown Scholarship Program.
Faced with steep student loans, expensive flights home, meal and educational expenses and difficult family situations, these students can struggle to support themselves financially due to the high cost of living at Georgetown. With no institutional support system, these students end up missing out while on the Hilltop.
The Income Gap
Established in 2004, the Georgetown Scholarship Program was created to combat the hurdles students like Lancaster often encounter on a campus where 51 percent of students come from the top 5 percent of the country’s wealthiest families. The program targets students who are among the first generation of their families to attend college and seeks to provide institutional support for students once on campus.
A January study by The New York Times found that Georgetown has consistently provided greater access to students from families in the top 20 percent than the lower 80 percent of families in the country over the last 10 years.
Seventy-four percent of Georgetown students are from families with an income in the top 20 percent while only 3.1 percent of Georgetown students come from the bottom 20 percent. The median income for a Georgetown family stands at $229,100.
The study categorizes Georgetown as an elite college and reports it to have the sixth highest median parent income when compared with 65 of its peer institutions such as Tufts and Vanderbilt.
Lancaster said she experienced the effects of this economic gap and believes many students may try to hide their financial hardships to fit in at Georgetown.
“I know that there are other students who have faced the same or even worse hardships than I have but it’s still something hard for me to discuss or even believe that people can relate because I feel as if many put up a mask to hide this,” Lancaster said.
Selah Shackelford (COL ’19) said she chose Georgetown because of its unmatchable financial aid offer. One of three sisters from Inglewood, Calif., she witnessed an evident socio-economic gap from a young age. However, as with Lancaster, the financial support did not completely eliminate the high cost of living on campus.
“I would stay on campus for some breaks and especially sophomore year where I stayed on campus for all breaks,” Shackelford said. “It was hard buying food. I had a job but I wasn’t making enough money.”
Lancaster had never even heard of GSP before setting foot on campus.
“When I first heard about GSP, I immediately thought, ‘Well, don’t I qualify for that?’ and wanted to be a part of it for both the financial support and the community support as well as their resources,” she said.
Only 9 percent of children born in the bottom income quartile will graduate from college. A 2015 Pell study compiling 45 years of economic research on social mobility finds wealthier students are eight times more likely to graduate college.
“Your socio-economic background is your destiny in our country right now, and that’s not fair,” GSP Director Missy Foy (COL ’03) said.
The School’s Support
GSP has served over 1,400 students since its inception. Currently the program caters to over 650 undergraduates, including 172 first-year students. Over 70 percent of GSP’s current students are first-generation.
Foy has worked with GSP college student since the beginning. Originally made up of 50 students and created to raise money to offset student loans, GSP has grown into an essential support network for many first-generation students on campus.
“We are looking at all aspects of the Georgetown experience from the day that you are admitted to the day that you graduate,” Foy said. “The idea is ‘where can we eliminate barriers’ because we want to make sure that Georgetown as an institution isn’t giving students a ladder to get over barriers but really focusing on knocking down barriers.”
Among the benefits GSP offers to its members are financial support for flights home, groceries, winter clothes and textbooks, as well as professional development opportunities like networking opportunities and job counseling.
The Selection Process
Students are not strictly admitted to Georgetown as GSP students, but rather as students on their own merit. Once they pass the admissions process all low-income candidates face a GSP committee selection phase. Throughout this time, candidates have no knowledge of the debates happening behind the scenes.
After all accepted students have received their decision letters in April, students are reviewed for GSP’s 1789 Scholarship or other benefits. Representatives from GSP, the admissions office and the Office of Student Financial Services meet to review candidates.
“All first-generation students who are admitted to Georgetown are reviewed for consideration and given very serious consideration because the focus of our program is first-generation students,” Foy said.
Foy said GSP works very closely with the financial aid and admissions offices to select students who they think will be living on the tightest budget while on campus.
“We meet the full financial need of admitted students, so even if you are not selected for GSP, the idea is that your full financial need would be met through a combination of scholarship, parent contribution, student contribution, work-study and loans,” Foy said.
But GSP is strapped for resources. Originally supposed to accept 150 students from each year’s incoming class, Foy and her team are currently serving 172 first-year students.
After the GSP committee review, students like Lancaster and Shackelford end up not gaining access to GSP benefits and receive whatever financial aid package the university offers.
Foy said the resources GSP has available limit the program from serving the full need students have on campus right now and said she worries some of these institutional limits force students like Lancaster and Shackelford to be left out.
“There are students that we have reviewed for GSP who we were not able to select because we didn’t have enough scholarship to reduce their loan,” she said. “For very compelling cases you don’t want to leave those students out.”
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69) said he understands why GSP must widen its reach.
“There are probably more people here who could legitimately benefit from [GSP] than actually are benefitting from it even though I don’t think there are many more. But there could be many more,” Deacon said. “Missy and her team try really hard not to exclude anyone who might need support or want it but it’s not just an unlimited resource that anyone who wants to can be part of.”
Deacon is currently preparing for the university’s next fundraising campaign to increase GSP’s reach and alleviate outlier cases through an endowment. Launched last year, GSP’s endowment fundraising has secured $19 million of a $25 million target.
Deacon said GSP is set to reach this target in two years.
Foy said her team often struggles to offer help to students who would fit into the GSP family but are not offered financial assistance.
“They are walking around on this campus and I think that is a real ethical and moral dilemma,” Foy said. “Do you reach out to them and say get involved in the program? Or is it a slap in the face to say you’re not going to get the scholarship, and rather we should wait for students to reach out to us and we can say, ‘I can’t offer the scholarship but I can offer X, Y and Z instead.’”
Foy said doubling the size of GSP would mean students like Lancaster would not be missed in the initial selection phase.
The Next Step
This past summer Lancaster realized her inability to discuss her financial problems would only hold her back.
“After a certain point, I felt I needed to talk to an adult about this at the school,” Lancaster said.
GSP currently offers an honorary membership option, which is designed for students who did not initially gain entrance to the program but sought to gain access to certain benefits GSP offers.
Becoming a GSP honorary member requires completing an application and meeting with a GSP coordinator. Honorary members receive some of the support that full members are offered such as receiving GSP emails, gaining access to special events and the ability to apply for financial grants, but lack the financial aid and loan relief awarded to full GSP students.
Both Shackelford and Lancaster ventured to apply for honorary membership. Shackelford was accepted at the end of the spring 2017 semester, and Lancaster is in the process of applying.
Shackelford said the experiences that some of her close friends in GSP shared with her pushed her to act.
“I had been having financial difficulties. It’s always hard for me to go home, little things that I struggle with financially that I can’t really do anything about,” Shackelford said. “I would just be thinking, ‘Wow, I’m in the same financial position as a lot of my friends and I should really think of joining’ because I saw the benefits where GSP really came through for them.”
Lancaster similarly is seeking to join GSP, as she sees the community as a necessary support system when she needs it most.
“I feel I would be exposed to a community that can help me, not just financially because they give need-based grants, but also emotionally,” Lancaster said. “It is really overwhelming at times to have to juggle school and work, and when I struggle it’s even harder for me to find the time to seek out the help that I need.”

The university advanced a plan to construct a temporary replacement for Kehoe Field after the board of directors approved a design study yesterday.
The announcement marks the first major step by the university toward replacing the field, which sits atop Yates Field House, after nearly two years of lobbying from student leaders. Kehoe was closed in February 2016 after club sports teams and university officials raised concerns over safety.
Club athletes had complained about uneven playing surfaces, exposed concrete and large sections of torn-up artificial turf.
The vote also represents a stark reversal from board members, who in June rejected proposals for a short-term fix until the university could construct a permanent replacement, according to Ricardo Mondolfi (SFS ’19), the Georgetown University Student Association representative to the board.
University officials gave student representatives a “definitive no” on a temporary replacement at a June board meeting, Mondolfi said.
Board members concluded that the short-term replacement, expected to last 10 years, would not be worth its multi-million dollar cost. Instead, the board expected to leave Kehoe shuttered for at least the next decade until Yates is ultimately demolished and entirely replaced by 2036.
Officials hope the renovation project, if it receives final approval, will be completed by the spring or summer of 2019 and cost about $5 to $10 million, according to Mondolfi. The new renovations are expected to address the field’s drainage problems by installing lightweight foam between the roof and the artificial turf surface, helping rainwater to drain off the roof into a nearby stream.
The engineering design for the renovation is expected to cost $500,000.
The field’s structural problems began when it was rebuilt on the roof of Yates in 1979. It was first constructed in 1942.
The lightweight concrete roof of the gymnasium does not properly drain rainwater, leading the field and the roof itself to deteriorate from pooling water. The field has been repaired twice since 1979, first in 1987 at a cost of $1.8 million and again in 2002 for $7 million.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said the Kehoe renovation is an “important project for our community,” according to a Thursday news release.
“After studying options to replace the field surface, we are pleased to be moving forward with plans for a replacement that will restore three acres of recreational space for our community and allow numerous club and intramural sports to practice and compete on campus,” Olson wrote.
The closure has left club sports teams without a dedicated practice field for nearly two years. Kehoe had previously been the main field for club sports teams, which now have to share Cooper Field with varsity and intramural sports teams or use off-campus fields at Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School and the Duke Ellington School of the Arts.
According to Perry Cao (SFS ’17), former captain of the Men’s Ultimate Frisbee team, conditions on those fields were less than ideal, and many were unlit. The team has struggled with recruitment, and attendance has dwindled at practices.
“The only time slot we could get was 5 p.m. to dark, and some of the weeks where we were off Cooper, 5:30 to dark was like 5:30 to 5:45,” Cao said in a February interview. “All of club sports is really, really furious about it, just because Georgetown has so little field space.”
Editor’s note: This article has been updated to clarify the status of the temporary replacement plan for Kehoe Field.

The Georgetown University Police Department is narrowing a list of potential suspects in its investigation of incidents of anti-Semitic graffiti and threatening messages directed at women in LXR Hall last month.
GUPD installed security cameras and established 24-hour patrols on the second floor of LXR Hall while it continues its investigation with Metropolitan Police Department officers and forensic scientists of the incidents reported in the floor’s bathrooms in September. GUPD has also cut a lock for restroom use on the floor and assigned officers to question students on the floor for information, according to GUPD Chief Jay Gruber.
“We are conducting an aggressive investigation into these hate crimes. Our detectives are focused on these crimes,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Since the beginning of September, seven incidents of vandalism with graffiti depicting swastikas have been reported to the GUPD; four of them were found in LXR.
The university stopped notifying the university community of the incidents by email after the incident Sept. 20 in an effort to avoid directing undue attention to the acts, according to a university spokesperson. The university has continued to send emails to East Campus residents only.
Meanwhile, students, faculty, religious leaders and administrators on campus are aiming for increased dialogue on the issue and solidarity for those targeted by the images and messages
According to GUSA Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18), Michael Smith, the director of affirmative action programs in the university’s Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action and other organizations have approached Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner to discuss possible responses to the bias-related incidents.
“In the coming month or so [Smith] is going to organize and collaborate with other departments of the university, like the Beeck Center, campus ministries and JSA to create a space for students to discuss these issues, like why is there an increase in anti-Semitism,” Andino said.
A “teach-in” titled “The Violence of Language and the Normalization of Gender Violence,” moderated by philosophy professor Mark Lance and women’s studies professors You-Me Park and Michelle Ohnohna, was scheduled to discuss “what was really written in LXR” on Wednesday.
The event was met with backlash from several students who noted posters for the event made no reference to swastikas or anti-Semitism.
LXR and Nevils Chaplain-In-Residence Reverend Rondesia Jarrett-Schell sent out an e-mail after the Sept. 20 incident, urging students to reach out to her for support.
“It is upsetting to have these incidents happening here in the community where we live,” Jarrett-Schell wrote. “To all students, especially our Jewish students who may have felt especially threatened by the swastika on the first eve of Rosh Hashanah, please know that I am available to meet, talk and support you.”
In addition, the East Campus Residential Team hosted a “Smoothie and Discussion Night” last Sunday.
Georgetown University Student Association President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) said it was important to downplay the attacks to avoid giving the perpetrator attention.
“There’s definitely a tension in situations like this where obviously it’s important to keep students informed and make sure the students know what’s going on,” Mack said. “Then there’s also the tension of when we send out blast messaging we’re amplifying the effects of what that person is doing.”
Alexandre Kleitman (SFS ’20), who lives near the restrooms where a swastika and hateful messages were found, said he thinks Georgetown should continue to openly condemn these incidents.
“I wonder whether it is better to not say anything because you don’t give legitimacy to the act or is it better to communicate about it and continue to reaffirm Georgetown’s stance again,” Kleitman said. “It’s better to have a conversation and speak about it and keep explaining why we’re against it because people are still going to know. I understand there’s an ongoing investigation but I still think you can address it without in any way harming the investigation.”
For Allie Gurwitz (COL ’19), such displays have made her feel supported by the community in light of the hate displayed in the messages.
“The pattern of anti-Semitic graffiti since the beginning of the school year has been unsettling, marginalizing and shocking,” Gurwitz said.
“With each additional occurrence, it becomes more and more apparent to me that at the very least there are people here at Georgetown who have no problem vandalizing our school with swastikas and violent language.”
Gurwitz said she has “found solace in the strength” of Georgetown’s Jewish community, the community’s “ability to counter hate with love for each other” and in the university’s support.
Kleitman said repeatedly encountering the bias-related incidents has incited fear in the dorm and created an uncomfortable atmosphere for residents, especially while the perpetrator remains at large.
“Whenever you walk by someone it’s at the back of your mind because this is happening literally in the bathroom next to ours,” Kleitman said.

Georgetown will not invest in private prison companies in keeping with the university’s Socially Responsible Investing Policy, the university announced yesterday.
The board’s Committee on Finance and Administration, which oversees the university’s management of financial resources, accepted the recommendation of the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, announced in March, for the university to avoid investments in private prison companies. CISR makes recommendations to the board on ethical investment policies and consists of 12 members, including faculty, administrators and three students.
The university will “encourage” its external investment managers to “avoid investing in the companies,” according to a university news release Thursday, which said the decision continues an existing practice.
The decision follows the board’s approval of a broad SRI policy in June, which established a general ethical framework for the university’s investment policy. The guidelines broadly require the university to consider the social and environmental impact of companies in which it invests.
Though the SRI Policy requires the university to make “reasonable efforts” toward these goals, it did not strictly require any new divestments, nor did it mandate any policies that would compromise the university’s financial interests. Investments discouraged under the policy include companies involved in providing abortion services, as well as companies deemed to violate “human dignity.”
The recommendation that the university establish a policy of “no direct investment” in private prisons passed in March by a majority vote of the CISR. The recommendation followed a divestment proposal submitted in January by three students: Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ’17), Sophie Bauerschmidt Sweeney (COL ’17) and Salma Khamis (SFS ’17).
The students’ proposal advocated divestment from “all private prison companies and companies that sustain private prisons,” as well as divestment from “companies that knowingly and consistently enable and profit” from the “violent Israeli occupation of Palestine.”
CISR adopted a narrower version of the students’ proposal on private prisons, recommending divestment from private prison companies themselves but excluding any judgment on investing in any other companies that are themselves invested in private prisons.
“The Committee determined it is inconsistent with Georgetown’s Catholic and Jesuit values to hold investments in companies that profit from the incarceration of human beings,” a CISR memo announcing the recommendation read.
While partially supporting the students’ petition on private prisons, the CISR rejected the divestment from Israeli occupation, citing Georgetown community members’ “many different perspectives” on how to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and doubts that the university’s divestment would be an “effective tactic” to end hostilities.
The headline of this article has been updated.

Hey Jeff, our proposal did not include “divestment from Israel” as you stated above. We proposed a very targeted divestment from companies that contribute to the many types of violence against the Palestinians living under occupation. None of the companies are Israeli. This is a gross mischaracterization that the Hoya has consistently propogated since you began covering the CISR process. We worked very hard on this proposal and wish that people would take the time to read the details before framing it as “anti-Israel.” More information can be found at gufreeorg.wordpress.com.

Reported cases of fondling on Georgetown’s main campus increased threefold from four in 2015 to 12 in 2016 and reported burglary cases increased from 31 in 2015 to 47 in 2016, according to the 2017 Annual Security Report released Sept. 29 by the Georgetown University Police Department.
In addition, three arsons were reported on campus in 2016. Until then, no arsons had been reported since 2012. Disciplinary referrals for alcohol increased by 28 percent, or 63 incidents, from 2015 to 2016.
The report, published each year in early October, provides crime statistics from the previous three years and offers information and resources on crime prevention for each of Georgetown University’s six campuses in Washington, D.C., Qatar, Italy and the United Kingdom.
According to GUPD Chief Jay Gruber, crime rates at Georgetown tend to stay consistently low overall — most year-to-year changes are not statistically significant.
“The good thing about Georgetown is crimes are very, very low,” Gruber said. “It’s difficult to see trends or any statistically significant increases or decreases at this point in time.”
Gruber said that the increased number of reported fondling crimes might not reflect an increase in crime, but rather an increase in reporting due to expanded sexual assault awareness on campus.
“Because of all of the work that has been done by the Title IX office and by the sexual assault task force based on the recommendations, there may be an increase in reporting by survivors of sexual assault,” Gruber said.
Georgetown University Student Association President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) said that GUSA is working to encourage students to report crimes to GUPD.
“One of our most important goals is making sure that there’s increased reporting because a lot of the time, these incidents go unreported,” Mack said.
Mack also said that GUSA is working both in the short and long term to improve student safety on campus, citing the university’s LiveSafe app as the most useful safety resource for students.
“The LiveSafe app is the number one most important resource that we want to make sure all students know about and know how to use because it integrates SafeRides, SafeWalks and a lot of the reporting features that exist within Georgetown,” Mack said.
GUSA Sexual Assault and Student Safety Chair Nina Young (SFS ’19) said that her office focuses on reducing students’ risk of falling victim to a crime and helping students part of marginalized groups on campus who may not be comfortable reporting crimes to GUPD.
Young also said it is important for students to be cognizant of difficulties facing sexual crime survivors when spreading awareness and promoting action.
“A big problem that we deal with is finding the proper line between awareness and oversaturating our students with information about sexual assault,” Young said. “We don’t want our awareness campaigns to be so wide that we’re triggering a lot of the survivors that are still here. We want to try to be sensitive to them.”
Gruber said that GUPD is concerned about the increase in reported alcohol crimes because overuse of alcohol can lead to other crimes.
“One of the big concerns that we have about alcohol use and overuse is that when a person becomes intoxicated, they could be more likely to be to be victims of a crime,” Gruber said.
Although the 2016 data did not show an increase in hate crimes, Gruber said that next year’s report may reflect the recent uptick in crimes targeting racial, religious or sexual orientation minority groups on campus.
“Georgetown is reflective of what is going on in the country,” Gruber said. “We are not immune.”

October 6, 2017 by Christian Paz 1 Comment 
Twenty-nine students from all four graduation years were sworn into the 2017-2018 Georgetown University Student Association senate Sunday, as the senate chose new leadership for the body and finance and appropriations committee.
A confirmation for Mattie Haag (COL ’18) to serve as a councilor for the GUSA Constitutional Council, the student association’s interpretative branch, was unexpectedly postponed after a senate motion led by Christopher Holshouser (MSB ’18) to investigate unclear developments he said constituents had brought to him.
Haag’s appointment is needed for the Council to function as a judicial body, as bylaws require all three councilors to be present for official business to take place.
Councilors must be nominated by the GUSA President and approved by a majority of the senate, according to the GUSA constitution and bylaws, and assume office after the outgoing President administers an oath of office. Appointments to the council by incumbent presidents rather than the outgoing have been heard by the senate in 2015 and 2016.
GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) nominated Haag after former councilor Natalie Brown (COL ’17) graduated at the end of former President Enushe Khan’s (MSB ’17) term.
The Constitutional Council previously ruled against the GUSA Executive and senate leadership in December 2016 after students opposing a planned dissolution of the senate and restructuring of club funding filed complaints to the Election Commission for election irregularities and appealed the Commission decision to certify the referendum results.
The senate voted to reconsider Haag’s appointment at its 5 p.m. meeting this coming Monday.
Ben Baldwin (SFS ’19) will serve as speaker of the senate and Sylvia Levy (SFS ’18) will serve as vice speaker. Baldwin previously served two terms as a senator from Freshman South and West Campus, as well as a member of the Finance and Appropriations committee, which allocates the student activities fee to club advisory boards, both years.
Holshouser will serve as the senate FinApp committee’s next chair, overseeing allocation of more than one million dollars in student activities fees.
Holshouser said he would work to engage a group diverse in gender, sexual identity, race and ethnicity to run for Fin/App positions, after senators raised concerns that the previous Fin/App committee featured mostly straight-identifying white males.
Holshouser said he pushed for the senate to postpone Haag’s confirmation to give senators time to consider any objections.
“Given that the senate was just seated for its first meeting I was of the opinion taking a week to get senators acquainted with senate function and not get bogged down in procedure on the first meeting was more beneficial to the constituents as the docket already was likely to take two hours,” Holshouser wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Baldwin, Josh Sirois (SFS ’20), Hunter Estes (SFS ’19), Owen Hayes (COL ’18), Javon Price (SFS ’20), Scott Lowder (COL ’17), Alejandro Serrano (MSB ’17), William Morris (COL ’19) and Zach Oschin (COL ’20) previously served on FinApp.
Levy previously served in the GUSA executive, chairing the mental health policy team during the 2016-2017 school year and sitting on the Mental Health Policy Committee from 2014 to 2016.
Baldwin said the newly inaugurated senate features students driven to hold the university administration accountable.
“In conversations with newly elected Senators, I have seen a drive and an optimism that truly sets this senate apart,” Baldwin said. “I would expect to see a number of resolutions and initiatives over the coming weeks that focus on holding ourselves and the University accountable to the greater student body, whether that comes as a response to hate crimes on this campus or ensuring that students’ activities fees are spent solely on student activities.”
Levy said during a speech before the election that she will focus on sexual assault and mental health advocacy.
“It’s very important that we use the GUSA senate to make some major statements about a broad range of issues pushing the university and the administration to really own up to different commitments and promises they’ve made around a wide variety of issues,” Levy said.
Levy said her term as vice speaker will be successful if she facilitates the senate’s advocacy work.
“My goal is to help my peers in the senate to do what they want to do – connect them to administrators and relevant student advocates – and really send some powerful messages from the GUSA senate about what student life should look like,” Levy said.
The Sunday swearing-in ceremony administered by GUSA Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18) marked the end of a two-week campaign cycle which saw the highest voter turnout — more than 30 percent of students — for a senate election without a referendum on the ballot in recent years.
Mack said he looks forward to working with the Senate.
“Under the strong leadership of Speaker Baldwin and Vice Speaker Levy, we’re hopeful that this year’s body will be an effective partner in  delivering meaningful change on shared priorities — affordability of student life, accessibility of campus resources, and advocacy on behalf of all students,” Mack wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Above all, we’re excited for the limitless potential of a united student government actively working to better the student experience at Georgetown.”
GUSA Election Commissioner Grady Willard (SFS ’18) said only the 2013 referendum vote on a satellite campus in Rosslyn, Va. saw a higher turnout.
This election was also the first time the Election Commission included student biographies on the Hoyalink voting page for students to read candidate statements.
Two formal complaints were filed to the Election Commission this year, including a candidate filing a complaint against themselves.
The second complaint involved violation of Office of Residential Living policy regarding distribution of posters and flyers in Darnall Hall.
The policy prohibits the distribution of materials door to door inside any residence hall and sets clear guidelines for posting indoors, including that posters must be 8.5 ” x 11” or 11” x 17” in length, submitted to the residence hall community director for approval and posted to designated bulletin boards.

Groundlessly obstructing a judicial oversight body you previously attempted to disband (because it ruled against you) isn’t great optics, particularly considering our current political climate. 
Not a great start for Baldwin and Holshouser as they try to rally their faction post-Lowder/Mullaney.

The Georgetown University Latin American community has come together to support Puerto Rican students and to raise funds and awareness for the island following the devastation Hurricane Maria wrought two weeks ago.
Students at the University of Pennsylvania launched a GoFundMe page Sept. 20 titled “Students with Puerto Rico” to raise $15,000 to donate to Unidos por Puerto Rico, a public-private initiative started by the Office of the First Lady Beatriz Roselló and a group of companies to help the victims of the hurricane.
Georgetown students were among the first to join the efforts, raising over $1,000 in the span of one day. Paola Mendez (COL ’18), the Georgetown representative for Students with Puerto Rico, said she jumped at the chance to help facilitate broader awareness and support for disaster relief.
The group reached their goal within the first 24 hours, as more student groups from universities across the country joined the effort. As of Thursday, the page had raised over $170,000, including a donation of $20,000 that came from NBC talk show host Jimmy Fallon.
Mendez, who was born and raised in Puerto Rico, said she wanted to make a difference from far away.
“I know so many people that couldn’t talk to or hadn’t heard from their families, and it’s so hard not being home or knowing what’s going on when such a bad thing is happening,” Mendez said. “From here, raising funds and awareness is really the only thing you can do. We’re just trying to do everything that we can from abroad.”

Omar Torres (COL ’18) has worked with Mendez over the course of the past few days to coordinate with student groups, administrators and the rest of the Puerto Rican community at Georgetown.
Mendez and Torres met with President John J. DeGioia last week to discuss the university’s response and their efforts to engage the broader Georgetown community in the effort. The President’s Office is coordinating a Sunday Mass fundraising event, in which all funds from collection will go toward disaster relief efforts.
Torres, also a Puerto Rican student, said that while the response from the community has been heartening, there is a long road ahead, and it is important to continue the efforts to maintain support for the island.
“[I want] just to raise awareness that people don’t forget about us. It’s easy to be dragged away by other headlines, but at the end of the day — and it’s sad that we have to say this, but we do have to say this — Puerto Ricans are American citizens. Just like someone from Texas or Florida is a U.S. citizen,” Torres said.
Various student groups, administrators and even Georgetown alumni have reached out to them to discuss ways to expand the efforts and develop long-term goals, like potential service trips and reconstruction projects, Mendez said.
“We obviously know that once this story is not a part of the news cycle anymore, there’s going to be a need to fill that [publicity] void and so we want to keep raising awareness and keep moving forward,” Torres said.
The group has engaged many of the more than 30 Puerto Rican students at Georgetown, and will continue to engage the rest of the Puerto Rican community at Georgetown.
David Santos (COL ’19), who has also been involved in the fundraising efforts, said he was encouraged by the responses from the Georgetown community.
“It was really surprising to see how much support people gave us. My dean, Sue Lorenson, professors and many students have all reached out to express concern and offer assistance,” Santos said. “I think it showed how much good a group of people can do when they come together for a cause.”
Santos said that this kind of effort is indicative of the ways that the university community can unite in moments of crisis.
“I think it is important that we all work to make the Georgetown community one where people feel they can reach out for help and receive a united and strong response,” Santos said. “Therefore, the way we respond to disasters that hurt others is what determines how we build a supportive community.

The Georgetown University Student Association is working to establish a program that would give students stipends for working unpaid internships.
The initiative, which parallels those at universities like The George Washington University, hopes to allow low- and middle-income students to better pursue unpaid internship opportunities in the District.
“Students would apply, and then if they have an unpaid internship related to something they’re really interested in exploring, it would cover the lost income that they would’ve otherwise gotten if they had gotten a job,” GUSA Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18) said.
The goal of the proposal is to allow students of all backgrounds to take an unpaid internship that could benefit them in their career field while still receiving compensation.
“We’re looking at how busy the culture is here at Georgetown. And sometimes students really want to intern, but at the same time they have to keep a job during the school year — and then they have school. Basically, it’s very hard,” Andino said.
The Cawley Career Education Center would manage the unpaid internship program and review unpaid internships for low-income program applicants, evaluating criteria such as the student’s career goals and socio-economic status.
The challenges that come with unpaid internships put Georgetown’s low-income students at a particular disadvantage, according to Georgetown Scholarship Program Director Melissa Foy.
“Summer opportunities — particularly unpaid internships — is one area where GSP students are at a real disadvantage.  Taking an unpaid, or modestly paid, internship means they’ll struggle to not only stay afloat financially in the summer, but they also don’t bring money into the following school year,” Foy wrote in an email to The Hoya.
GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) said the program would be another sign of institutional support for students from low-income backgrounds.
“Students from a lot of different income backgrounds experience Georgetown differently, and it’s important that all types of students are supported and that we’re really making sure that we’re creating programs to help,” Mack said.
Other universities in the area and nationwide like Columbia University and the University of Notre Dame provide unpaid internship stipend programs for students like the one GUSA hopes to institute.
GWU’s program, the Knowledge in Action Career Internship Fund (KACIF), encourages “GW students to pursue high-quality, necessarily unpaid internships that foster their career exploration and enhance their academic program, while reducing the financial challenges associated with unpaid internships,” according to the program’s website.
The Georgetown administration has been receptive to the proposal up to this point, Mack and Andino said.
“This is one of those projects that aligns with everyone’s goals. The provost’s office, the president’s office, the financial aid office and the Career Center are the key administrative departments we’re working with, and each of those groups sees this as something that would benefit their goals,” Mack said.
Mack said the next step is securing funds.
“We’ll have to see, based on the amount of funding that we can procure for the program, the range of students that we’ll be able to support and the depth of support that they can receive,” Mack said.
To make the program viable for the future, GUSA would need to set aside funding each year.
“The way it’s sustainable at all other universities is it’s endowed. That’s the long-term goal,” Mack said.
[…] asked in an interview with The Hoya about his priorities going forward, Mack cited the GUSA executive’s proposed stipend for students seeking unpaid internships that is set to launch its pilot program in the spring. He also noted the importance of responding to […]

Two Georgetown University student organizations are increasing security measures to protect against cyberattacks, according to senior leadership of the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union and Students of Georgetown, Inc.
The Corp is currently formalizing password guidelines and implementing a company-wide password policy for Corp-specific online accounts. Meanwhile, GUASFCU executives plan to migrate on-site servers to a cloud platform to increase security and reliability.
The Corp’s increased scrutiny of employee passwords comes after a breach last month allowed a still-unidentified hacker to send a sexually explicit email to all Corp staff. The Corp is continuing to investigate the email, CEO Melina Hsiao (COL ’18) said.
Last month’s incident is not The Corp’s first experience with hacking. In February 2016, the company was forced to close all of its storefronts for two hours after a hack of its servers.
The switch to cloud-based system at GUASFCU comes as prominent organizations and government agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, are increasingly adopting the technology to prevent breaches in cybersecurity.
Cloud platforms are considered more secure by some IT professionals, because a company’s data is stored off-site at data centers that often have stronger security defenses than traditional data systems. Continuant, a global managed service provider, predicts 90 percent of businesses will be using a form of cloud platforms by 2018.
GUASFCU Chief Technology Officer Nick Matz (COL ’18) said cybersecurity is among the credit union’s top priorities this year.
“Cybersecurity is of the utmost importance to the Credit Union,” Matz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have made significant improvements to our network this year. We continue to invest in information technology with our own funding, and with additional funding from the National Credit Union Administration,” a federal agency that regulates federal credit unions.
University Information Services have not been contacted by The Corp to help with their internal hack investigation, according to UIS Chief Information Security Officer Joseph Lee. However, since The Corp maintains a company email system separate from the university, UIS would not be able to provide substantive aid in a hacking investigation.
The Corp has taken further steps to strengthen their cybersecurity. This fall, the student-run company switched payment processing systems from Square to Clover. Bank of America Merchant Services partners with Clover, making it a more secure point of sale system than Square,
according to Hsiao.
The university required both organizations to increase the security of their payment processing services this summer by installing separate internet networks to handle financial transactions. The new networks bring the two organizations into compliance with mandated credit card industry standards. Both GUASFCU and The Corp previously used the university’s internet network to process financial transactions.
The shift to dedicated networks was necessary because the university’s Wi-Fi is not designed with vendor’s needs in mind, Lee said.
“Our first obligation for network access is not to third-party vendors and businesses that have to be running all day,” Lee said. “It is primarily for the students, primarily for the faculty and primarily for teaching, learning and also research.”
UIS had been aware for years that student businesses were using the university’s Wi-Fi to process transactions; they began working with on-campus vendors two years ago to establish a separate network for financial transactions. This summer, UIS assisted The Corp and GUASFCU in contracting an internet service provider for their new networks.
However, Hsiao said that processing payments over the university’s internet network did not pose a security risk or put Corp customers’ data at risk.
“The only violation was that we were using the university’s network,” Hsiao said. “It wasn’t that the university’s network wasn’t safe enough.”
Though GuestNet is not unsecure, it was never intended to be a secure network for businesses but rather a convenience for guests visiting campus, Lee said.
“From a business standpoint, there’s a lot of rules you have to follow in terms of what your IT needs to look like and what your network needs to look like,” Lee said. “We don’t say that GuestNet, for example, will meet those needs. It’s good for personal use but for business needs, that’s a completely different thing.”
Despite the successful implementation of GUASFCU’s new network, Matz expressed worry that his organization would not be able to rely on UIS for network assistance as in the past.
“In our contract with [UIS] before, they did have a lot of things that they would help us with,” Matz said. “And now that they’re not our internet service provider, I’m worried that they’re not going to be as willing to help us with those things.”
Despite those concerns, UIS’s advisory relationship with student organizations will remain what it has always been, Lee said.
Hsiao said she is not concerned about The Corp’s continuing relationship with UIS.
“UIS has been really great to work with and there’s definitely been no negative impact on our relationship,” Hsiao said. “I think, if anything, it strengthened it.”

The Washington, D.C. Council passed emergency legislation Tuesday to give restaurant owners the ability to choose whether to allow dogs in outdoor dining areas.
The bill, which also requires restaurant owners to post signs about their dog dining policy, was passed unanimously to respond to recent outrage over the D.C. Department of Health’s rules prohibiting dogs from entering outdoor dining areas, which had rarely been enforced until recently. D.C.’s charter allows the Council to pass emergency legislation without Congressional review if the Council and mayor’s office agree on the urgency of an issue.
Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) is expected to sign the legislation into law and update the Department of Health’s regulations, a spokesman for the mayor confirmed.
The push for legislation began in mid-September, when a health inspector told Peyton Sherwood, owner of The Midlands restaurant in Columbia Heights, that his dog was no longer allowed on his restaurant’s outside patio. The inspector told Sherwood that a District resident had recently complained about dogs in restaurants in an article in The Washington Post.
“It’s very disappointing, because everyone loves bringing their dogs out to the patio,” Sherwood said to Washingtonian. “There are rats. There are opossums. There are raccoons and squirrels and pigeons that are all over patios in Washington, DC. But having a well taken care of, loved, and vaccinated animal on a leash is not OK.”
The resolution, co-sponsored by councilmembers Vincent C. Gray (D-Ward 7), Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1), Brandon T. Todd (D-Ward 4) and Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), notes that the city faces a health crisis, especially in its eastern quadrants. The councilmembers said the Department of Health should not be utilizing its finite resources to enforce archaic laws that could hurt the profitability of small businesses.
“The Department of Health’s limited time and resources are being marshalled to suddenly enforce an unknown and previously unenforced regulation about dogs being allowed in outdoor patio dining areas,” the resolution reads. “This enforcement has reduced commercial activity from patrons at the impacted businesses.”
After the incident, Sherwood asked fellow citizens of the District to contact their D.C. Council representatives and began circulating a petition to have the law changed. Jasmine Gossett, the spokesperson for the Department of Health, defended the health inspector’s actions at the time, saying that the regulation had to be enforced.
“The D.C. Food Code prohibits animals in commercially licensed food establishments. This is not a new regulation and DOH has enforced when observed,” Gossett wrote in an email to Washingtonian. “We inspected several locations based on consumer complaints about the presence of dogs, of which Midlands was included in.”
Nadeau said she had heard from about fifty constituents who had urged her to take action on the bill allowing dogs in outdoor spaces. Nadeau said the health regulations were not appropriate.
“This one just really seems like a no-brainer to us,” Nadeau said in an interview with The Washington Post. “These spaces are really special gathering spaces for our community, and that includes our canine friends.”
Gray, who is mulling a run against Bowser in the Democratic primary for mayor next year, tweeted out a message Oct. 3 criticizing the mayor for being unable to focus on important issues, such as health care for citizens. Rather, Gray said, Bowser was waging a “war on pets.”
“[Bowser] seems unable to properly prioritize life or death health care challenges over matters of far less concern using limited time & resources waging #WarOnPets,” Grey tweeted. “I’m focused on combatting urgent health issues.”
Sherwood praised the Council’s decision to allow dogs back in restaurant outdoor spaces and especially the speed at which it worked to do so. He noted that his dog, named Andypants, would be returning to the patio of The Midlands soon.
“It was really sad not having all those fuzzy faces around,” Sherwood said to The Washington Post. “So today is really nice. It was awesome to see everyone working together to get this done so quickly.”
A Twitter account, @PupsOnPatios, emerged to advocate for the dogs to be allowed back in outdoor spaces at restaurants. After the D.C. Council passed the resolution, it tweeted out a message of support.
“The Dining With Dogs emergency legislation introduced in @councilofdc today leaves it up to DC restaurants & bars to decide whether to allow dogs on patios, while ensuring safety & sanitation,” @PupsOnPatios tweeted. “We determine that to be pawesome.”

Former journalist and journalism lecturer Sanford J. Ungar will explore the status of censorship and free expression in the United States through a new two-year Free Speech Project beginning this fall.
The project aims to document cases of free speech violations or reinforcement of expression in colleges, governments and social life and track them for future research and policy recommendations.
With institutions of higher education like the University of California, Berkeley and the Georgetown University Law Center in the spotlight for free speech issues, Ungar and his research assistants, Graham Piro (COL ’18) and Will Haskell (COL ’18), will investigate and compile the history of freedom of speech in the United States and specific flash points on college campuses.
“We will study the condition of free speech in America today, both in higher education and in civil society, in an attempt to create frameworks that promote public discussion about divisive issues in a civil manner,” Ungar said in a Sept. 20 press release.
Georgetown has seen its own cases of intolerance of speakers with unpopular policy positions or personal beliefs. Students protested invitations to speakers including Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards and former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson last spring, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions Sept. 26.
Piro said the Free Speech Project would look into ways colleges can balance their academic missions with the spirit of free expression.
Ungar, who served as President of Goucher College in Baltimore, Md., for 13 years, said universities must work actively to secure this balance.
“At the heart of this project is how universities and American society at large can uphold the First Amendment while also protecting people from harassment and threats of violence,” Ungar said in a press release.
Based on their results thus far, the research team said they believe the common perception that college campuses silence mainly conservative viewpoints may not be true. According to Haskell, some media outlets overstate the degree to which censorship happens, and both liberal and conservative voices end up silenced.
“Right wing media coverage leads many to believe that conservatives are disproportionately facing censorship at institutions of higher education,” Haskell said. “However, we’ve tracked a variety of incidents in which liberal views are silenced through death threats, harassment or intimidation.”
The Free Speech Project will also interview academics, policymakers and activists to analyze different perspectives on the subject. According to Ungar, the hypothesis of the project is that free speech-related incidents across all levels are related.
“When you have stark and deadly confrontations in Charlottesville, Va., and brawls and death threats on the floor of the Texas legislature, you cannot expect college and university campuses to be islands of civility and peaceful debate,” Ungar said in the news release.
Haskell said current attitudes and events at the state, city and college levels make this research timely and important.
“States are passing laws that make peaceful protest legally perilous and physically dangerous,” Haskell said. “College students are shouting down speakers with whom they disagree instead of engaging with them on the merit of their ideas.”
Haskell said disputes surrounding speech often do not end with angry discussions or disagreements but escalate to mass manifestations and even violence, providing further impetus for the project. At U.C. Berkeley, protests of conservative commentator Ann Coulter escalated to violent riots April 27, while a white nationalist protest in Charlottesville Aug. 13 devolved to violence, resulting in the death of one counter protestor.
“State legislators are literally brawling when they cannot work out their differences. From a counter-protester losing her life in Charlottesville, Virginia to athletes defying the president’s tweets by taking a knee during the national anthem, the First Amendment has reached a crucial juncture,” Haskell said.
Piro said issues of free speech are particularly relevant to college students, due to the exposure they have on campuses to speakers, professors and peers with different beliefs and ideologies.
“Free speech is an issue that is essentially unavoidable when you’re enrolled in higher education in America,” Piro said. “It can be a wide-ranging issue encompassing issues of campus speakers and student activism.”
Ungar said a balanced understanding of free speech ensures students remain open-minded.
“We have to understand and deal with the fact that some young people may try to shut down speech they find offensive because they are worried that they won’t have their own opportunity to speak up and be heard,” Ungar said.
Haskell said their research seeks to defend the value of speech in higher education.
“Campuses should be places where the free exchange of ideas flourishes,” Haskell said. “If that isn’t the case, then we’re not getting our money’s worth.”

Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) condemned the Trump administration’s response to the post-hurricane crisis in Puerto Rico in a question-and-answer session hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service on Wednesday.
DeLauro questioned the White House’s delay in sending relief efforts to Puerto Rico and encouraged attendees to bring attention to the issue to spur action.
“These are American citizens,” DeLauro said. “Why did it take so long to visit Puerto Rico? Why did it take so long to waive the Jones Act? We ought to be standing up and screaming from the rafters. That is the only way that we will turn things around.”
The Jones Act limits shipping to U.S. ports to exclusively American-made ships staffed by American crews, preventing foreign aid from reaching Puerto Rico in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
DeLauro, who has served in the House of Representatives since 1991, also discussed the U.S. social safety net, the subject of her 2017 book, “The Least Among Us: Waging Battle for the Vulnerable.”
She said the social safety net is more than a series of programs — Medicare, food stamps, unemployment insurance and minimum wage, among others — as it also reflects American society and values.
“For me it is not just a collection of programs. But rather, it is a reflection of the values of our country,” DeLauro said. “It is about our responsibility — a social responsibility — but a moral responsibility to one another, and that’s particularly in times of need,”
DeLauro said the current administration and Republican Congressional leadership are intrinsically hostile to the idea of a social safety net, preferring a system that would rely on private institutions instead.
“The atmosphere in the House now is not conducive because of the fundamental view that the government should not be playing a role in people’s lives and being there as a safety net,” DeLauro said. “The belief is that nonprofits should take care of it and religious organizations should take care of it, and that we should jettison the government’s role in these things.”
She said the ideological shift against social programs has been discernible since 1994, with Republican leaders in Congress like former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and current Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) seeking to shift the burden of programs like Medicaid to the states.
DeLauro also noted that her Republican colleagues have not made concerted efforts to repeal the program altogether.
DeLauro reflected on the influence of her parents’ service in the city council of New Haven, Conn., on her views on social security and the role of government in improving community living standards. She recalled that representatives would reach out and listen to the community and address their needs.
“They didn’t write a healthcare bill. They didn’t write a crime bill or a transportation bill,” DeLauro said. “What they did was to minister to their community if they needed help with social security, immigration, or getting their son or daughter a job.”
DeLauro said that these lessons have been at the core of her service in the House of Representatives.
“Whatever it was that helped people make their way through the system, that’s what they made real in our community. And I took those lessons to the House of Representatives,” DeLauro said.
Though she acknowledged that many challenges lie ahead for the social security net, she encouraged the audience to mobilize and advocate for these social programs while reaffirming her commitment to a battle she has fought for more than two decades.
“You don’t make progress by standing on the sidelines, whimpering and complaining. You make progress by implementing ideas,” DeLauro said. “This is what I have worked to defend for 25 years. A vision for America that I want to expand so that all Americans can support each other in difficult times and share in prosperity.”

The mistreatment of inmates in New York State’s Attica Prison over 40 years ago is relevant in scrutinizing current U.S. prison policy, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Heather Thompson argued in the Intercultural Center Auditorium on Wednesday.
The Prisons and Justice Initiative in partnership with Georgetown University Lecture Fund and the Department of History hosted Thompson to speak about her award-winning novel, “Blood in the Water: the Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and its Legacy.”
The riot that took place in the Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York in 1971 remains relevant today because it reflects the current state of the American criminal justice system, Thompson said.
The United States incarcerates the world’s largest prison population and is an international outlier with regard to racial disparities in incarcerating minorities, according to Thompson.
Thompson said the Attica uprising has negatively affected the U.S. prison system. Based upon prisoners’ demands for better living conditions and political rights, the riot served as a defining uprising of the prisoners’ rights movement, a national effort by inmates to defend their civil rights.
A prison management decision to lock prisoners and guards in a hallway triggered a full-blown riot. The prisoners took hostages, most of them guards and civilians, in attempt to demand basic rights from the state.
“What we got wrong about Attica shaped the nation, for us all, for the worse,” Thompson said. Thompson categorized the uprising as a defining revolt in human rights.
“On September 9, 1971, a series of really unexpected kind of ordinary things led to one of the most extraordinary human rights protests of the entire 20th century,” Thompson said.
Thompson used a photo presentation to show the inhumane conditions in which the 2,400 men lived. Each inmate was fed on a budget of $0.63 per day, given one square of toilet paper per day and pushed to hard labor. They were seldom allowed to shower.
The prisoners assumed the correctional facility would provide them with support, according to Thompson.
“All of these men, the guards and prisoners alike, had this amazing faith in the system which is that you ask for help you explain the situation and somebody’s going to hear you and their going to step up and make it better for you,” Thompson said.
Thompson said prisoners’ demands included an end to labor, more Spanish-speaking guards and religious freedom.
Despite the state of New York’s initial agreement to most demands, Nelson Rockefeller, the New York governor, denied the prisoners’ request for amnesty in September 1971, and the uprising intensified, Thompson said.
“They all thought that the hostage lives mattered. They didn’t understand race in America in 1971,” Thompson said. “They didn’t understand what was really at stake for these politicians and how dispensable they all were if the battle was going to be between them and prisoners.”
Within minutes, 39 men, prisoners and hostages died. 128 men were shot multiple times by police forces in helicopters.
Thompson said the American public was left in the dark about the riot conditions. New York State officials told the world that the prisoners killed the hostages. Meanwhile, the prisoners at Attica were being brutally tortured.
The state of New York has not admitted responsibility since. Still, the riot appears on all records, but the documents that Thompson found during her research have disappeared.
“When we accept the story of what goes on behind prison walls from the people who are in charge, we can go down some very immoral, dangerous, horrendous paths,” Thompson said.
Thompson said despite powerful forces trying to silence stories, whistleblowers should fight to make their stories known.
“The thing about prison — and the thing about Attica — is, eventually, human beings, particularly those who are put in cages, particularly those who are denied basic human rights, will eventually speak up,” she said.
[…] year, the initiative invited Heather Ann Thompson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “Blood in the Water: The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and […]
