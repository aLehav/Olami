Four students were victims of bias-related incidents in New South Hall on Sept. 6 and 11, and a similar incident occurred in Darnall Hall sometime between Sept. 11 and 13, according to the Department of Public Safety.
Swastika symbols were drawn and the name “Hitler” was written on dry-erase boards hanging on the doors to the victims’ rooms. A first-floor resident of New South, who wished to remain anonymous due to the nature of the incident, said he returned to his dorm room at night to find graffiti drawn on his dry-erase board. While the vandalism was not related to Nazism, he said he thought it was likely drawn by the same people who drew a swastika on one of his floormate’s doors. The defaced dry-erase boards were scattered throughout New South.
“The general belief is that this was done by a group of non-Georgetown students who were let into the dorm. It is positive that it was not done by Georgetown students, but it could give other people ideas,” he said.
DPS Investigative Sergeant David Ruiz said DPS could not comment on this supposition, but added that the case was under investigation and that the Metropolitan Police Department had been notified.
Students in New South responded strongly to the incidents.
“This needs to be addressed. I hope the suspects are revealed. People were pretty upset by it,” the resident said.
In an email to New South residents Monday evening, Hall Director Alberto Lorenzo and Denise Fung, area coordinator of First Year Halls and Henle Village, expressed similar sentiments.
“The actions of a few do NOT reflect the beliefs of many. Such incidents show a blatant lack of respect for others and are offensive to Hoyas who are part of New South,” the email said. “We are committed to the positive and civil exchange of ideas. Every person in New South is unique in [his or her] own way. . Part of attending any institution of higher education is having the opportunity to have meaningful and constructive dialogue where opinions can be expressed intelligently – not by anonymously leaving disparaging or attacking comments or images in buildings around campus.”
The crimes occurred between the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
“It’s disconcerting that this happened so close to the Jewish holidays,” a New South resident said. “It made the whole incident worse.”
The most recent instances of vandalism are reminiscent of a series of crimes that occurred on and around campus in the last two years. In January 2008, a student in Harbin Hall woke up to a suspect drawing a swastika on his thigh while in bed. In March 2009, the Schutzstaffel (SS) symbol was drawn graffiti-style in the Village A mailroom and a swastika symbol was spray-painted on a wooden door to Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School on the 3500 block of P Street. A cross with the SS symbol pictured across it was also drawn in graffiti onto an exterior wall of the Leavey Center in March 2009.
DPS does not have a description of the suspect, and it is unclear whether there is any link between these crimes and those of the last two years.
“It is way too early to tell if there is any link. The connecting line is that they are both hate crimes,” DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith said.

On Tuesday, Rose Gottemoeller (I ’75) and Richard Burt, respected scholars and policymakers in nuclear disarmament, discussed the merits of the new Strategic Arms Reduction treaty, which limits the number of ready-to-deploy nuclear weapons for the United States and Russia.
The speakers each made concise arguments for ratification despite the entrenched partisan battle over the treaty in Washington, D.C.
“There is a great deal of momentum toward ratification . [The U.S. government] should grasp at it .” said Gottemoeller, assistant secretary of state of verification, compliance and implementation.
The START treaty, which had been signed by President Obama and President Medvedev, would be considered by the U.S. Senate within the week, said moderator David Hoffman, former editor of The Washington Post. U.S. treaties signed among nations require Senate approval.
The treaty, however, which would build upon a previous START treaty signed in 1992 during George H.W. Bush’s administration, will come under serious pressure, warned Burt, former ambassador to West Germany and chairman of Global Zero, a nonproliferation group.
“I had to look up the vote for the START treaty in 1992; it was 92-5. Only five senators came out against the treaty in 1992, a true bipartisan effort. I think [the START treaty] will be ratified sooner or later . but it will generate more than five negative votes, and I don’t understand why,” Burt said.
According to Burt, since the Russians under the Medvedev administration had been very open and engaged in the reduction process, that instead of something being wrong with the treaty, maybe “there’s something wrong with the politics in this city.”
“[The signing of the treaty] is not only a historic moment . but also a moment for bipartisanship,” Gottemoeller said.
Those gathered at the event seemed impressed by the evident agreement between the speakers.
“Both clearly conveyed and agreed on the START treaty. It was a right step forward, and creates a framework for future negotiation with Russia and the United States,” Drew Bausher (COL ’13) said. “I especially liked how [Gottemoeller’s and Burt’s] proposals didn’t set strict numbers on each type of nuclear weapon, but on a total number. The different interests of the two countries would require compromises on the numbers.”

After five years as dean of the McDonough School of Business, George Daly will leave the post at the end of this academic year.
“I didn’t want to die in office,” Daly joked in an interview with THE HOYA. “When you make the level of change that I’ve had the privilege, with others, to make, there’s sort of a natural [moment to stop],” he added.
His tenure has seen the school expand significantly. With the completion of the Rafik B. Hariri Building and the founding of new executive MBA programs, Daly has recruited nearly 60 new faculty and staff members and created more than 300 new spots for graduate students.
“There’s been an enormous amount of change .” Daly said. “I think now [the school] is at a level where we’re really poised to take it to the next level.”
Daly also highlighted the less obvious moves he has made as dean, such as reworking how the school finds, promotes and pays faculty.
“It’s sort of like a relay race … the outcome of one dean is only fully known three or four years after that dean is no longer dean . ” he added. “I would be even prouder of the change that is likely to occur in the next five to 10 years here.”
Other faculty members echo his accomplishments.
“The number of students, faculty, staff – everything has grown,” said Reena Aggarwal, professor of business administration and finance and interim dean in the year before Daly’s arrival. “And there’s a lot more visibility to the school, partly with the new building. The kinds of speakers who are coming in here, and the types of events that are being held here have been pretty remarkable. Now we’re really starting to take advantage of our Washington location.”
Daly admits that his successor will face considerable challenges. “Globalization . increases sources of competition from all over the world, and that’s just as true among universities, and especially among business schools, throughout the world,” he said. “We’re trying to prepare the school for that.”
Aggarwal added that while the popularity – and revenues – of the MSB’s degree programs have grown rapidly, there is little potential for further expansion. “We still lag behind our peers in terms of finances,” she said, “and we have to think creatively about what these new sources of revenue are going to be.”
Daly came to Georgetown from New York University’s Stern School of Business, where he had served as dean for nine years before stepping down in 2002.
“I had had enough of that, and I went back to teaching, and frankly I found that that wasn’t exciting enough for me,” he said. “I took this job because I felt that if there was any school in the country that had the opportunity to really move up, it would be this particular school.”
And yes, he said, it did satisfy his desire for excitement.
“I feel that this school will have an imprint on it from what I have, with my colleagues, been able to do,” he said. “I would guess that most of my colleagues, including some who wouldn’t like the things that I did, would have to agree, `Boy, this is a different place.'”
After he leaves his office as dean next year, Daly plans to take a year-long sabbatical to travel and pursue his research into leadership in professional sports.
Following his sabbatical, Daly said he plans to return as a part-time professor in the Hariri building, with its students, classrooms and, occasionally, snakes.
“Well, we just found a black snake inside [the MSB Commons],” Daly said. “But the biggest regret is that I would’ve built it a little larger. We’re already at capacity.”

Starting in January, the College will offer a new film and media studies minor to its undergraduates.
“The Faculty Working Group determined that a minor program would best provide students in the College with the opportunity to add the serious study of film and media to their existing interests, expanding learning in other fields by adding work on media,” Dean Bernie Cook (COL ’90, G ’91), who has been a force behind establishing the minor over the last 10 years, said in an email.
The minor consists of FMST-100: Gateway to Film and Media Studies, four minor electives and FMST-400: Capstone in Film and Media Studies.
According to professor Robynn Stilwell, an instructor in the program, the gateway course will serve to introduce students to three major aspects of the minor: film analysis and theory, hands-on experience with cameras and an exploration of social justice through media representations.
For the four electives, one must be Media Creation (Filmmaking Studio or equivalent course) while another of the electives emphasizes Film/Media History or Theory. Another elective deals with media and social justice, and students are encouraged to choose a community-based learning course for that elective. The final elective will be a free elective with a focus in media creation.
To designate a set course as a film and media studies course or elective, the core faculty of the program will seek out courses that centrally consider film and media from historical, theoretical and creative perspectives.
In its first years, the minor will be offered to 15 to 18 students. According to Cook, as the program grows with the help of external donations, it may be extended to more students within the College and eventually to all four undergraduate schools of the university.
For students eager to pursue film, the program opens doors.
“When I first became interested in film, I hoped to use it creatively to promote issues that were important to me, and I know of many other Georgetown students who feel similarly,” Lauren D’Souza (COL ’14) said. “With the new film and media studies minor, I feel like I will be able to broaden my appreciation for the media arts in both an aesthetic and intellectual sense, and I am very excited to get involved with such a program,” said.
Stilwell says that the program will round out Georgetown’s academic offerings nicely.
“I think it’s going to be an exciting addition to the College’s curriculum – although in some ways, it’s not a radical addition, many of these courses have been out there for a while, but the minor will make its presence on campus more focused, and students will have a coherent cohort for the first time. And by integrating the Georgetown ethos of social justice, we will be creating a film and media studies minor that’s unlike any other of which I am aware,” she said.
As the chair for the faculty working group on the project, Cook will assume the directorship of the program for its official launch in January.
Cook said his love for cinema goes back to when he proposed an independent film study class to professor John Glavin in 1990 as a senior at Georgetown. With the minor’s establishment, Glavin will now serve as a faculty member in the program.
Although Cook proposed the minor a decade ago, the plan gained traction after former Dean Jane McAuliffe inaugurated the Film and Media Studies Initiative in the College with the goal of developing resources for a program in 2005.
The Film Screening Classroom, located in New South Hall, was the first accomplishment in the push for expansion of the program. With the support of an anonymous donor and members of the Georgetown Entertainment and Media Alliance, the first classroom at the university geared for teaching and learning with film and media was created; the New South classroom will serve as home base for the minor program.
Current sophomores and juniors may apply for the program, and are asked to write an essay of no more than 500 words on their desire to minor in film and media studies. Preference will be given to those students with a cumulative GPA at or over 3.3. Applications are due Oct. 8 by noon to filmandmediastudiesgeorgetown.edu.
An information session about the program will be held Thursday, Sept. 16, from 5:45 to 6:45 p.m., in the New South Film Screening Classroom.
ore information can be found on the major’s website at https://filmandmediastudies.georgetown.edu.

The percentage of alcohol-related emergency calls placed at the university has remained at 10 percent since the 2009-2010 academic year, even as area schools see a rise in the number of students dialing for help.
The George Washington University’s numbers have gone up 14 percent in the past year. Two hundred seventy-one GWU students were transported to the George Washington University Hospital during the 2009-2010 academic year, up from 238 students the year before.
Only 10 percent of the calls Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service receives are linked to alcohol, according to the Georgetown Health Education Services website. The other 90 percent of GERMS calls involve other medical issues ranging from cardiac distress to behavioral emergencies. The most common type of GERMS call is for sports-related injuries.
When asked about these numbers, GERMS Public Relations Manager Brendan Maggiore (MSB ’11) confirmed them, but also noted that while 10 percent of calls to GERMS are alcohol-related, not all of those alerts result in transportation to the hospital.
“[Ten percent] has been the trend with very little variation for the past six years that we have been tracking call volumes.
About half of these alcohol-related calls do not end up as transports,” Maggiore said in an email. “After a thorough evaluation, we allow the students to sign a waiver and stay in their dorm.”
There are multiple causes for Georgetown’s low statistic as compared to GWU’s. According to Maggiore, the reason for the disparity between the two schools’ rates lies in the reach of each university’s emergency response team. Whereas GERMS serves a residential area, EMeRG, GWU’s ambulance service, provides emergency assistance to the multiple city blocks that make up GWU’s campus.
Students may also simply not want to call GERMS for alcohol-related issues, though Maggiore demented the negative connotations attached to alcohol-related incidents.
“From personal experience in my three years with the organization, I do not think there is a stigma around being `GERM-ed’ for alcohol,” Maggiore said. “The vast majority of the people who call for themselves or their friends have recognized that the situation is out of their comfort zone, and they want someone with a little more experience.”
Nevertheless, Kelly McCabe (COL ’12) noted that while she would make fun of a friend who was treated by GERMS for alcohol poisoning, she wouldn’t let it affect her overall view of the friend.
Georgetown does not adopt an official amnesty policy protecting underage students who call for help, though no disclipinary action will occur. The policy at GWU also excuses underage drinkers calling EMeRG from disciplinary action if they have not already received an alcohol-related transport.
Georgetown’s low numbers may also result from a lack of a Greek system, unlike GWU’s. Other universities that do not officially recognize Greek life, such as Princeton University, have noticed that students who are members of Greek organizations are more likely to need alcohol-related transport assistance than those who are not.
Eighteen percent of Greek life members need help as opposed to only 6.5 percent of on nomembers, according to The Daily Princetonian. Princeton University does not have a student-run ambulance system like GERMS or EMeRG.
aggiore said he hopes that students do not hesitate to call GERMS if they need to.
“We’re here 24/7 and happy to respond to any medical emergency. Even for the calls where we end up allowing the patient to refuse transport, we certainly do not mind coming for the evaluation – it’s what we’re here for,” he said.

At odds with a major pharmaceutical company, professor Adriane Fugh-Berman recently published a report revealing that Wyeth, a subsidiary of Pfizer, paid for ghostwritten articles promoting the use of one of its drugs for conditions not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
According to Fugh-Berman, an associate professor in the department of physiology and biophysics, the articles suggest the use of estrogen-progestin drug Prempro for non-FDA approved conditions.
Fugh-Berman’s analysis of industry documents pertaining to the issue was published on Sept. 7 in PLoS Medicine, and she also serves as a paid expert witness for plaintiffs against Pfizer and Wyeth.
Recently banned by the Medical Center in its Policy on Industry Relationships, the ghostwriting process is a contested topic in the medical community. At least one physician at the Georgetown University Medical Center agreed in the past to publish a ghostwritten article on the supposed cardiovascular benefits of hormone therapy against cardiovascular and other diseases, according to Fugh-Berman’s report.
Prempro was approved by the FDA for treating menopausal symptoms, but Wyeth marketed the drug as a preventative method for a variety of other medical problems as well.
“Essentially, these articles claimed that Prempro reduces risks while it actually increased risks,” Fugh-Berman explained. “Ghostwriting is common. This study is really the tip of the iceberg. It proves that medical literature has been corrupted.”
A statement from Pfizer said that Fugh-Berman’s analysis neglects the review process to which medical journal articles are subject, however.
“This article completely – and conveniently – ignores the fact that the published manuscripts were subjected to rigorous peer-review by outside experts on behalf of the medical journals that published them, and that their integrity and scientific rigor has even been recognized by multiple courts,” Pfizer said in a statement.
And according to Fugh-Berman, the practice of ghostwriting is not uncommon in the medical community. Recent studies estimated that 10 percent of articles in the medical literature are ghostwritten.
“Ten percent is a big underestimate,” Fugh-Berman added. “That’s just the people who admit it.”
The ghostwritten articles were meant to diminish concerns that hormone therapy may cause breast cancer and to defend claims that Prempro offers benefits such as the prevention of cardiovascular disease, Parkinson’s disease, dementia, vision problems and wrinkles, according to Fugh-Berman. She said she feels that these claims are unfounded.
A large, federally funded trial by the Women’s Health Initiative concluded that Prempro increases the risk of invasive breast cancer and blood clots, which can cause strokes. It also reported an increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease, countering claims from ghostwritten Wyeth articles that declare that Prempro decreases cardiovascular risk.
DesignWrite, a medical education and communications company, was paid $20,000 per article for ghostwritten reviews of the drug. The company would then present the articles to physicians who would agree to “author” the reviews in medical journals.
Wyeth also allegedly paid $25,000 per article for four primary publications, or publications that report clinical trials, concerning findings by the Women’s Health, Osteoporosis, Progestin and Ed9 Estrogen (HOPE) study.
Since the FDA does not regulate medical journals, drugmakers can use ghostwritten articles to promote non-FDA approved uses of their drugs or to affect perceptions about their drugs without FDA regulation. Physicians who agree to “author” these articles are presented with complete drafts, and the original writers are often uncredited.
Physicians often rely on medical journals to keep up with changes in the medical field. Ghostwritten articles that are meant to promote a product can compromise the integrity of peer-reviewed journals.

Two current MSB students and one alumnus will demonstrate the spirit of Georgetown entrepreneurship this Wednesday with the launch of a website focusing on off-campus housing.
For Peter Swiek (MSB ’10), Joey Friedrich (MSB ’13) and Michael Crouch (MSB ’13), an ordinary MSB class project one year ago led to the group’s brainchild: an online application to provide students with a more efficient means of searching for off-campus housing. The service, dubbed FindMyHousing.com, is a central database listing of off-campus housing in which individuals can find, post and rate various residential offerings in the university area free of charge.
Swiek, president and founder of FindMyHousing.com, said there was a clear need for this service on the Hilltop. The company has developed strong connections with both Georgetown University Student Association and Georgetown University Off Campus Housing Resource Center and is currently engaged in dialogue with the university in order to become an official service for students, Crouch said in an email.
“This business began when I recognized a dire need for an off-campus housing service at Georgetown University,” Swiek said. “The current housing environment is a real burden for students because it fails to address their needs and wants.”
Through the website, students may search for housing by viewing an aerial map of Georgetown populated with color-coordinated pushpin graphics for different types of listings, such as apartments, houses, rooms and parking.
Additionally, students can view posted pictures and take advantage of the website’s integration with Google Street View. When students find a desirable property, they can bookmark it for later or send a message to the user who posted the listing. Listings expire after 45 days have elapsed.
“Students will now have the ability to search, post and rate off-campus housing options easily and free of charge,” Crouch said.
Swiek added that the website will include a database of all theoretical off-campus housing.
“We worked the entire summer refining the directory and can’t wait to release it to students,” he said. “While regular listings expire, the directory is a permanent listing on FindMyHousing that students can view to research and rate properties.”
Properties are rated on six different axes: value, location, conditions, neighbors, landlord and overall. Only students will be able to access this portion of the website.
The website, which will officially be launched to the Georgetown community on Sept. 15, has already attracted over 100 students and selected landlords who have registered.
The team hopes that what started as a class project will evolve into a successful business, leading to increased experience and knowledge of the business sector.
“Being able to witness an idea for a school project evolve into a fully functioning business has been an incredibly motivating and confidence-building experience,” Friedrich said. “It has shown me that, with the right work ethic, good ideas really can develop into something real and concrete.”

On Monday, September 13, 2010, the Center for Peace and Security Studies hosted a discussion on the START Treaty. One of the two people invited was Richard Burt, the U.S. Chair of Global Zero, a group dedicated to reducing the number of nuclear weapons to zero. The very first person to ask a question to the panel was Dane Shikman (SFS ’13), the executive director of the Georgetown University branch of Global Zero. After the discussion, Shikman agreed to an interview with The Hoya.
What motivated the foundation of the Global Zero chapter at Georgetown University?
Global Zero movement has been gaining steam with North Korea testing their nuclear weapons and with Iran testing their nuclear capabilities, and that has given us the momentum to step up to the plate and to face these proliferation issues in a new way, saying that deterrence is the only way to combat nuclear proliferation, and that the only truly safe world is one in which nuclear weapons do not exist, or if they’re heavily monitored. On a national level, the Global Zero leaders decided that they wanted to form a grass-roots organization, rather than everything coming from the top down.
Why should people be motivated to fight for non-proliferation in this time-period, in the post-Cold War era?
The risk of nuclear weapons is vague. None of us can see it, New York or Washington D.C. being destroyed. We can’t envision it, and we don’t want to envision it. We have a habit of thinking that it’s not real. But if you talk to generals, they will tell you that there are terrorists that are hell bent to deliver nuclear weapons to New York City.
The threat is real. You have North Korea, which is continuing to defy the world, and Iran, which may develop a nuclear weapon in the next couple years, or even months. You have this new security environment, different from what existed in the Cold War. In this one, you can’t have huge numbers of nuclear weapons that can be easily accessed. The risk of nuclear catastrophe outweighs any of the benefits that used to exist during the Cold War.
Nuclear weapons are considered the ultimate deterrence. Why would the United States surrender the “ultimate weapon”?
The United States is the nation that needs nuclear weapons the least, because we have the strongest conventional armed forces in the world. We have extremely precise warheads that are not nuclear. Therefore, the issue of defense lies not with the United States, but with smaller states, which believe that nuclear weapons would be a deterrent. Nuclear deterrence, though, has been partially debunked, because if you look at multiple situations, you’ll see that nukes did not deter attacks, such as with Israel in the 1973 war, or the coalition forces during the First Gulf War. They knew that those nations had nuclear weapons, and that debunks the idea that nukes will prevent any form of attack against a nation.
How realistic do you think a world with no nukes is?
It will require international cooperation that we’ve never seen before, at an unprecedented level, that they’ve never been forced to do before. It will be very difficult, requiring the resolution of regional conflicts such as in Korea, or between Pakistan and India, and making sure that nations like Israel feel safe, so it’s going to be very hard, but we’ve done hard things, things we thought were impossible, like the United Nations. Therefore, us telling ourselves that it’s impossible is making that idea true. The more we say it’s futile, the less energy [we] put into making it a reality. The framework is there, with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which would just need extended powers to be a strong inspection force to be very effective. It’s about changing the paradigm of nations [to] one of trust.
Would there be a point of compromise that would be acceptable to your group?
If you have more nuclear weapons, then there’s more availability, and less safety. There’s a negative correlation between the number of weapons and the safety of the world. Optimally, we would have zero. However, I would prefer a world with fewer nuclear weapons than the world we have currently, but only in a world with no nuclear weapons would there be total safety.
Some politicians are making the START Treaty a political issue, accusing senators who vote for ratification of being soft on national security. Is this message affecting the public, and how do you plan on responding?
The political climate is very different from when the first START Treaty was signed. The Republican senators opposed to the treaty are not trying to make Americans safer, they’re trying to oppose President Obama. They’re focused on beating Obama, which creates significant problems with trying to ratify the treaty. It will have to involve grass-roots movements. It’s about convincing people that having large amounts of nuclear weapons is not the best, nor safest option for peace, and even after this bill, we’re still going to have 1,550 nuclear warheads. Even the most warlike of people will have to acknowledge that we still have a lot of nuclear weapons.
Is the non-proliferation movement also an anti-war movement?
Global Zero has nothing to do with conventional military strength. Many times, we actually refer to nation’s conventional forces to argue that they will have enough power to repel attacks, and that wars that are going to be fought should only be fought with conventional weapons. We are not primarily an anti-war group.
What are Global Zero’s plans to remove all nuclear arms from the world?
Global Zero has a step-by-step action plan that would ensure a timeframe. The START Treaty is a big step in that. The next step would be to bring Russia back to the table and make even more drastic cuts to nuclear arms levels. If we cut those all down to 1,000, we can encourage the rest of the world to enter the conversation.
How likely is it that a nuclear bomb will go off during our lifetimes?
I think it’s likely. Realistically speaking, I think it may take a nuclear explosion for the world to realize how serious of a problem nuclear proliferation is. If it happens, either here or in Europe, it might be an explosion that would galvanize everyone to make true steps to cut down on nuclear weapons.

Until Oct. 16, the creative talents of professors in the art and art history departments are on display in the Walsh building’s Spagnuolo Gallery,
According to Sharon Moody, painter and Georgetown lecturer on design and painting in the art and art history departments, “Our faculty are a prolific, creative group, and there’s a wide range of media, styles and subject matter in this show that reflect the breadth of our department. In this show you can see everything from the latest cutting-edge digital art, through contemporary approaches to traditional materials.”
Those who have visited the exhibit agree that the variety of pieces make the show vibrant and eye-catching. “All the pieces manage to stand apart – some bringing to mind what we do with our day, others about larger themes regarding the human condition,” Anastasia Baran (COL ’13) said of the Spagnuolo exhibit.
oody’s contribution to the show includes two paintings in the trompe l’oeil genre, a term meaning “fool the eye” because the paintings are flat but create the illusion of three-dimensionality.
Historically, these paintings have used a type of printed paper as their subject, such as currency, letters or fine art prints.
“To update the genre [trompe l’oeil], my subjects are contemporary Pop imagery – I’m interested in consumer products, especially labels, packaging and other printed material. They’re technically challenging to paint convincingly, and of course we respond to them as artifacts of our culture. They’re accessible – everyone read them in childhood,” the artist said of her work.
The exhibit is free to the public and is located on the first floor of the Walsh building.
