A representative from the U.S. Department of State discussed embracing identity in the foreign service as part of the Diverse Diplomacy Leaders Speaker Series, an initiative that connects Georgetown University students with foreign policy practitioners. 
The Jan. 18 event featured Desirée Cormier Smith, the State Department’s first special representative for racial equity and justice. The Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, a center within the Walsh School of Foreign Service that studies future challenges in diplomacy and domestic politics, hosted the talk. 
In her role, which falls under the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Cormier Smith spearheads efforts to protect marginalized communities around the globe. In the moderated discussion, she shared both personal and professional experiences from her time working in foreign service to explore the importance of diversity in diplomacy.
Cormier Smith, a political science and psychology major at Stanford University and a graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, said she had not always planned on entering a career in diplomacy.
“I like to call myself the accidental diplomat, because growing up I did not know there was such a career. I did not know that the State Department existed. I didn’t know that there was a thing for me in the State Department,” Cormier Smith said at the event. 
Cormier Smith studied at Oxford University in England, an opportunity she said gave her one of her first exposures to racist treatment in foreign service.
“Some of the formative experiences that I had with racial discrimination or racial injustice actually happened to me overseas,” Cormier Smith said. “The first time I was called the n-word, I was studying abroad.”
Despite challenges with racism, she said her background and identity were also strengths that enabled her to bring a unique perspective to the table.
“Many of us are multiple things at once. I am a Black American woman, so I need my Black American identity or my identity as a woman. I bring all of that with me and all of the history and the inspiration from my family and my community,” Cormier Smith said. 
Prospective diplomats, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, should bring their own distinct identities and cultures proudly to their work, according to Cormier Smith.
Cormier Smith said she feels it is important to have a State Department staff that reflects the United States as a whole, not just the most privileged members of society, in order to better serve the American people.
“Why wouldn’t we harness the unique diversity of our country? Why wouldn’t we want an institution that is supposed to be representing the American people, why wouldn’t we want it to look like these people?” Cormier Smith said.
While reiterating her commitment to racial diversity, Cormier Smith said it’s equally necessary to recognize the various kinds of diversity that exist and the intersectionality of multiple identities, all of which add value to foreign policy.
“We’re talking about gender diversity. We’re talking about LGBTQ+ persons. We’re talking about people with disabilities. We’re talking about regional diversity. We’re talking about people from various religious backgrounds,” Cormier Smith said. 
An alum of the Pickering Fellowship, which provides fellows with a fully-funded master’s degree in exchange for at least five years working in the foreign service, Cormier Smith said she recommends getting involved in foreign affairs while in college through internships.
Reflecting on her journey from Girl Scout to diplomat, Cormier Smith said she feels immense gratitude and a sense of fulfillment from her career in the State Department.
“It’s an incredible honor,” Cormier Smith said. “And it’s such a privilege to be able to serve my country and my community.”

The government of Rockville, Md., is discussing changing the voting age from 18 to 16 years old for local elections in an effort to increase voter turnout and youth participation in community affairs.
A public hearing on the issue is scheduled to take place Jan. 30 following the Rockville Charter Review Commission’s unanimous recommendation to lower the county’s voting age to 16 years old in municipal elections. Beyond lowering the minimum age to vote, the commission is also exploring other new electoral policies, such as creating representative districts and using a ranked choice voting system. 
The commission said that because 16- and 17-year-olds are contributing community members who are directly affected by public policy, they deserve a political voice.
“People who are 16 and 17 years old are a part of our community, experience and receive Rockville government services, are impacted by policy in which they have no voice, are employed in Rockville and pay taxes, contribute to their households and to our community,” the commission’s 2022 report reads.
Sixteen-year-olds obtain similar scores to adults in measures of citizenship, including tolerance of others, civic knowledge and political interest, according to a January 2011 study conducted by professors at Rutgers University.
Based on this data, the commission said it believes 16-year-olds have the same cognitive ability and social maturity to participate in local elections as adults who are eligible to vote.
Georgetown University Votes, a student-run, nonpartisan organization at Georgetown that aims to increase voter participation, said that while it does not endorse a particular position on the issue, it praises the efforts being made to increase civic engagement.
“GU Votes commends Rockville, MD in brainstorming new and innovative ways of making voting easier– especially for young people,” a GU Votes spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “GU Votes applauds these conversations: electoral reform and innovation are important topics and deserve a place in our national dialogue.”
Rockville’s commission used voting data from a 2016 case study by Vote16USA, a national campaign that supports efforts to extend voting rights to 16- and 17-year-olds at the local and state levels. The case study focuses on Takoma Park, Md., and Hyattsville, Md., which both lowered their voting ages to 16 years old by 2015, to show that those under 18 years old vote at higher rates than other demographics.
Forty-four percent of the registered 16- and 17-year-olds voted in Takoma Park in 2013, a turnout rate more than four times that of the general population, according to the study. This trend continued with 34% of the registered 16- and 17-year-olds voting in 2014 and 45% voting in 2015, compared to 28% and 21% by the general population. However, a relatively small percentage of 16- and 17-year-olds in these counties registered to vote — in Takoma Park, only about 36% of 16- and 17-year-olds were registered to vote in November 2013, compared to about 62% of the general Maryland population. 
The commission claimed that voter participation will increase in the long run with a lower voting age because of the habitual nature of voting, as those who vote once are more likely to continue voting in subsequent elections.
In addition to a long-term increase in youth voter participation, the commission said that by allowing teenagers to vote, a trickle-up effect will occur where these new voters will encourage older generations to vote more.
“Lowering the voting age to 16 will not only help to increase voter turnout in the short term, but will establish new engaged voters that will increase voter turnout for the long term,” the commission’s 2022 report reads. “This provision also has proven to have a multiplying effect, as younger people who vote directly influence voter turnout of their parents/caretakers and older residents within their community.”
Looking ahead, GU Votes said it is optimistic about continuing the discourse around voter rights and methods to increase voter turnout. 
“We hope these conversations, regardless of the particular policies they ultimately produce, produce a stronger, more perfect union in which individuals may more freely exercise their right to the ballot box,” the GU Votes spokesperson wrote.

The MedStar Washington Hospital Center has opened a new Biocontainment Unit (BCU) designed to prevent highly infectious diseases from spreading. 
The unit, which MedStar Health announced Jan. 19, is equipped to handle patients with severe respiratory syndromes and highly infectious diseases including Ebola, cholera and yellow fever. It will feature 10 beds for respiratory isolation and two rooms for biocontainment that feature negative air pressure to prevent the spread of infectious particles, according to MedStar’s press release. The 6,800-square-foot unit also includes two special pathogen rooms where operations, labor and delivery can take place. 
Vice President and Chief Public Health Officer at Georgetown University Dr. Ranit Mishori (MED ’02) said the setup of the new unit will be beneficial for both patients and health care workers. 
“The unique features of MedStar’s new biocontainment unit will ensure those who work there can have all the resources they need to manage these serious diseases, and that those who may have to be treated there will have access to high-quality care in a setting that promotes best infection-control practices,” Mishori wrote to The Hoya. 
Mishori said being proactive enough to prepare for infectious outbreaks that may impact the community is a critical component of public health, especially since the D.C. region is an international hub. 
“From a public health perspective, I hope we never see cholera, plague, Ebola, or any of the other special pathogens in our community, but we certainly have to worry about them and plan ahead,” Mishori told The Hoya. “The DC Region is often among the first to see special pathogens due to our status as an international hub of diplomacy, education, and global travel. These special pathogens represent both a clinical, as well as a public health, concern.” 
When clinicians are not using the new unit for patients with infectious diseases, they can house patients who require extended care but do not qualify for inpatient admission, according to the MedStar hospital’s press release.
Shane Kappler, the medical director of the new BCU, said the idea for the unit originated in 2014 following the spread of Ebola in the United States, which required a significant amount of hospital space to contain patients. 
“We knew that we needed to find a new way to provide the needed resources to care for these patients with special pathogens,” Kappler said in MedStar Health’s Jan. 19 press release.
In October 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services designated MedStar Washington Hospital as one of 13 Regional Emerging Special Pathogen Treatment Centers (RESPTCs) in the nation, awarding the hospital a $3 million grant to help fund the unit.
Craig DeAtley, the director of Emergency Preparedness and the interim program director who will manage the BCU and grant funds at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, said the grant will fund better equipment that will help ensure hospital workers are better protected from infectious diseases. 
“The $3 million ASPR grant provides funding to expand the volume and type of equipment we need to take care of more patients and supports our partnership with the other 12 regional special pathogens treatment centers,” DeAtley said in the Jan. 19 release.
John Kraemer, an associate professor in Georgetown University’s department of health management and policy, said the unit will make everyone safer, not just clinicians.   
“Washington Hospital Center’s biocontainment unit is a very good development both to protect clinicians and the broader community,” Kraemer wrote to The Hoya. 
According to Mishori, anticipating health crises is essential. 
“Preparedness is a key element in Public Health and having this biocontainment unit, knowing that it exists right here in the District, is very reassuring,” Mishori said.

Washington, D.C. will begin phasing out their pandemic housing program immediately for unhoused and medically vulnerable residents due to a lack of federal funding.
The Department of Human Services announced Jan. 6 that the Pandemic Emergency Program for Medically Vulnerable Individuals (PEP-V), an initiative that opened hotels exclusively for unsheltered, medically vulnerable individuals, will not be continuing. The program, which began in March 2020, helped house over 2,200 District residents experiencing homelessness, according to the D.C. government. 
At-large District Councilmember Robert White cited monetary issues as a contributing factor to the decision to gradually eliminate PEP-V housing, according to a Jan. 6 press release. 
“The Department of Human Services (DHS) has announced that it will phase out the Pandemic Emergency Program for Medically Vulnerable Individuals (PEP-V) in part due to the lapse of federal government funding to support the program,” White said in the press release.
White maintained that the DHS is committed to protecting unhoused individuals as the program ends despite the decrease in federal funding. 
One method for doing so will be the distribution of housing vouchers, according to the press release.
“In this transition, we must ensure that DC residents experiencing homelessness who are currently being housed temporarily in hotels through PEP-V have a safe and stable place to stay as the program phases out,” White said in the press release. 
Many people in PEP-V are likely eligible for housing vouchers, according to a source familiar with the subject.
Annemarie Cuccia (SFS ’22), accountability reporter for The DC Line and Street Sense Media, said the District has been delayed with its distribution of housing vouchers.
“Worth noting 1. because of PEP-V requirements, a lot of residents are eligible for PSH vouchers if they’ve experienced homelessness for a while and 2. it’s still taking D.C. a long time to get the people eligible for PSH vouchers into housing,” Cuccia wrote in a Tweet shared with The Hoya.
PEP-V served 488 customers and matched 249 individuals to permanent housing locations between March and October 2020. Of these 488 customers, 85% were Black or African American, and around 40% were between 60 and 69 years of age.
The program expanded to a fourth hotel as the demand for PEP-V increased, according to an email sent to community members on Apr. 2, 2021. 
The DHS also said it was grateful for its stakeholders in the email but clarified that the program would not be permanent.
“We appreciate the robust advocacy for the expansion of the PEP-V program and we are counting on members of our community to support both the successful expansion of this temporary program as well as the successful transition of individuals as we quickly prepare to phase out the program this coming fall,” the DHS said in the email.
Despite its mention of a fall 2022 phase-out of PEP-V, the DHS did not end the program until Jan. 6, 2023, for unstated reasons.
The source familiar with the subject also said that supporters of PEP-V are especially worried about how unhoused D.C. residents will get through the winter months without the shelter provided by the program. 
White emphasized that although the PEP-V program is ending, support for medically vulnerable and unhoused D.C. residents is still a priority as COVID-19 rates continue to remain high. 
“The challenge of protecting medically vulnerable unhoused residents from COVID-19 and other health risks is not going anywhere, and congregate settings are not appropriate or safe for everyone,” White said in the press release. “I’ll be conducting close oversight of this process to ensure that the city meets the needs of unhoused residents who should not be in congregate settings.”

Distinguished poet and award-winning author Patricia Smith engaged with students through a seminar discussion and poetry reading Jan. 24.
Hosted by the Georgetown University Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice, an initiative that studies poetry in the contemporary world, the event was part of a year-long program that 16 student fellows joined this academic year. Students in the program meet with various acclaimed poets and take a spring seminar course with Carolyn Forché, Georgetown English professor and Lannan Center director of readings and talks. The event consisted of a one-hour conversation between Smith and the fellows, dinner, a public reading inside Riggs Library and a reception where Smith signed copies of her book, “Incendiary Art.”
Forché said the seminar and program series bring poetry to life for students by giving them the chance to learn from poets in person.
“It is very interesting to bring living writers and poets to engage with our students because they have the experience of the work coming off the page and entering their own lives and being sung into a room filled with attentive listeners,” Forché told The Hoya. “It has been really gratifying to work on this, and I bring poets that I believe will have a profound effect on the people who speak with them here.
The Academy of American Poets recently named Smith as a new chancellor, a prestigious distinction given to only a few people in the field of poetry. Smith is also a professor of creative writing at Princeton University and has won the National Poetry Slam four times.
Smith said the seminar portion of her visit allowed her to personally connect with the student fellows over a common interest in spoken word.
“You are in a room of people who are passionate about the same thing you are passionate about,” Smith told The Hoya. “There is a kind of release in the conversation. It is like, I leave there, and I am happy and excited about what poetry is doing.”
Patricia Guzman, the program manager at the Lannan Center, said Smith’s poetry closely addresses important issues through a unique lens.
“To read her poems is to not shy away from the ugly parts of social injustice but to really see the moment, whether in the past or present, clearly,” Guzman wrote to The Hoya. “Patricia Smith is an acclaimed, award-winning poet, but she is also a poet of her community.”
Elina Choi (CAS ’26), a fellow at the Lannan Center who introduced Smith at the public reading, said Smith’s work impacted her from an early age.
“Personally, I have been such a huge fan of slam and spoken word poetry, and when it comes to American spoken word, I think Ms. Smith is really one of the best, if not arguably the best,” Choi told The Hoya. “I really think poetry readings are so special because they allow the poet to convey their poem exactly how they wanted it to come across.”
Smith read excerpts from several of her books, including “Incendiary Art” and her upcoming book “Unshuttered.” She also read poems inspired by her Chicago community. 
Smith said she did not decide on a finalized list of poems to read until she was on stage. Smith brings a wide range of poems to pull from during her readings, and she said she enjoys being inspired by the physical space and audience of each performance.
“I like designing the reading as I am going along,” Smith said. “I like having a lot of types of poems at my disposal so that they can design it, so it becomes unique to every audience.”
Several of the poems that Smith performed focused on social justice issues, particularly racism in the United States. Smith told attendees that poetry was initially a recreational activity for her, but she later learned that it impacts listeners in unanticipated ways.
Smith said that during one of her events in the past, while reading a poem that she had written about fatal shootings of young people in her community, two women ran out of the room because they were picturing their own sons hurt by gun violence.
“That is when I know that you do not know who is in an audience, and people are looking for their stories,” Smith said at the event. “Most of us, when we are going through something, we feel alone. Poetry can reach out and say, ‘No, it is not just you.’”
