As the nation reacts to President Donald Trump’s immigration ban, members of the Georgetown community joined together in solidarity with students and faculty affected by the ban in a vigil in Red Square on Wednesday night.
About 200 people attended the Hoyas for Justice: Solidarity Vigil, where members of minority groups on campus shared their personal stories relating to the recent changes in federal policy.
Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order temporarily banned entry into the United States for citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations, as well as refugees from all nations for 180 days and from Syria indefinitely.
University administrators have identified about 20 students who hold student visas and are citizens of one of the seven countries under the immigration ban: Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Libya, according to Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh.
Students who spoke at the vigil expressed concern about the effects of Trump’s ban and rhetoric on them and their families’ ability to feel safe in the United States. Participants also expressed their drive to fight back against the ban.
University President John J. DeGioia sent a campuswide email Sunday urging students to “empathize with others in need.”
“We are an institution that values the contributions of our international students, staff and faculty, and we are deeply committed to interreligious dialogue and providing a context in which members of all faith backgrounds are welcomed and encouraged to practice their faith,” DeGioia wrote.
The Georgetown University Student Association released a statement on Facebook and the senate passed a resolution affirming a commitment to solidarity with Muslim students Jan. 29.
“In light of President Trump’s recent executive orders, we recognize the major implications these developments have on several of our Hoya family members,” the statement reads. “We want to reaffirm our love and support for all students on our campus, regardless of religious identity or immigration status. You belong here.”
The Georgetown University College Democrats also supported a statement released Saturday night by the Georgetown University College Republicans speaking out against the executive order.
GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) also spoke at the solidarity vigil.
Kumail Aslam (COL ’19), one of the organizers of the event, said at the vigil he was inspired to express solidarity by his parents, who instelled in him the message of Martin Luther King Jr.’s quote, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.”
“I think of my mother, who places her belief not in me, not in you, but in the American people, in the good of all humanity,” Aslam said. “When I think about why we do what we do, the tremendously difficult things that we do, it is because we fight to carry on the legacies of the leaders who came before us.”
On-campus organizations have planned events throughout the week to discuss the impacts of the immigration ban and show support for affected communities.
The Iranian Cultural Society hosted an event just before the vigil to write letters to senators and congressmen to urge them to lift the immigration ban. The Center for Contemporary Arab Studies and the African Studies program, co-sponsored by the School of Foreign Service, also hosted an Emergency Town Hall to respond to the ban on Thursday night, featuring panels of immigration lawyers, members of the D.C. Muslim community and advocates.
GUCD, GUCR and the Alexander Hamilton Society are set to host a phone-a-thon this afternoon at 3 p.m. to senators and congressmen to campaign against the executive order.
Imam Yahya Hendi, Georgetown’s Muslim chaplain, also invited attendees at the vigil to a service in solidarity with Muslims in Bulldog Alley today at 1:30 p.m.
Indra Acharya (COL ’18), who spoke at the vigil, shared his experience being born and raised in a refugee camp and disavowed the Trump administration’s disregard for the human lives of refugees. As a refugee, Acharya said, he was forced to come to the United States where he was labeled a terrorist by his classmates and discriminated against by high school officials.
“Believe me, I was not a terrorist. I was terrorized by the same terrorists that you label as terrorists and for me to hear that this small young child living in Syria, these refugees living in other countries are being labeled as terrorists and denied access to the land that I call home today, it hurts,” Acharya said. “I just don’t understand how on earth we can do this. If we are human, we will be able to understand the challenges, the struggles that people face.”
Sarah Clements (COL ’18), who spoke at the vigil, said in an interview with The Hoya that it is important that the entire Georgetown community join together.
“Even before this election and all of this began happening in our government, the Muslim community and the Jewish community on campus were very close-knit, and I know a lot of my peers in the Jewish community feel a really deep sense of urgency and responsibility to have the backs of our friends,” Clements said.
Muslim Student Association member Kawther Bernahu (COL ’19) said in an interview with The Hoya that it is important for people affected by Trump’s policies and their allies to engage in caring for themselves and one another.
“I just want to highlight that there are other forms of solidarity. When people reached out to me and asked me how I was feeling and what things were like and just showed me on a more intimate level that they were there for me, that also is a form of solidarity,” Bernahu said. “There are a lot of people whose families are being impacted directly and while mobilizing and protesting are important in their own respects, reaching out and having a personal connection is very important during these times.”
While a vigil in solidarity with marginalized members of the campus community is one step in the fight against policies like the executive order, those who attended the vigil must not stop there, according to Zack Abu-Akeel (SFS ’18), who spoke about his role in the Muslim community on campus.
“Being here right now feels right and it feels good and it makes me feel better. It’s an important first step. But I want to center that this is just a first step for all of us. We can’t go home from this and pat ourselves on the back and think we’ve done something. This is just the starting point to galvanize us for action,” Abu-Akeel said.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) introduced a new program Monday aimed at increasing students’ access to public elementary schools, despite concerns that the plan may be inaccessible to students in low-income neighborhoods.
The announcement marks a change in the D.C. Public Schools’ policy toward charter schools, which are publicly funded schools operating independently of the area school system. Previously, charter school enrollment was determined solely by a lottery system.
The “walkability” program grants access based on the proximity of the schools to the students’ homes. This program would allow students residing within a certain distance of a charter school to become eligible to attend that school.
Currently, about 45,000 students — half of the DCPS student population — attend charter schools, but the proposal could affect the up to 10,000 students who live more than a half-mile from their designated public school and within a half-mile of a charter school.
Still, charter schools choose to opt in to the program, then decide if they should add the “walkability” standard to other admissions preferences, such as preference for siblings of current charter school students.
If the D.C Council approves the measure, the plan will go into effect during the 2018-19 school year.
Currently, District students are guaranteed enrollment at one of D.C.’s 61 public elementary schools. However, under the new system, students will be offered a preference in the admissions lottery if they live within a half-mile of the charter school they wish to attend or if they live more than a half-mile from a DCPS-zoned school, according to a statement from the mayor’s office.
In an interview with The Hoya, Bowser said the new plan strikes a balance between advocates and critics of charter schools. The opponents of charter schools argue that traditional public schools can shut down due to the popularity of charter schools, leaving many students without traditional public school access. Supporters of charter schools maintain that access to a higher quality education outweighs the costs.
“We have achieved a delicate balance that is working for us. There is enough choice for parents who want to go outside of their neighborhood schools and we have had robust investment in our traditional public neighborhood schools,” Bowser said. “I think we have achieved the right balance in Washington, D.C.”
Bowser also said she hopes the next federal secretary of education does not interfere in the District’s education plan, for fear of disrupting improvements she has made in the public school system.
Currently, President Donald Trump’s nomination for the position, Betsy DeVos — a billionaire and former chair of the pro-school choice education advocacy group American Federation for Children — has been an advocate for charter schools.
DeVos has expressed support for using public school funds to pay for private education through various programs and vouchers.
“People who like to experiment in education sometimes look to Washington, D.C., as a place to try things,” Bowser said. “In my discussions with the president and the people who are surrounding him around education policy, my message is ‘We’ve got it right in D.C.’ We have choice for parents and families who want it and investment that we need in traditional public schools.”
In her announcement at the D.C. Bilingual Public Charter School, Bowser said the plan’s purpose is to create easier access for students who are forced to travel longer distances because they live far from their schools.
“We are moving full steam ahead to ensure all our young people have access to the high-quality education they need and deserve,” Bowser said. “My administration will continue to expand opportunity and make unprecedented investments in public education so that students from every neighborhood, in every ward, are set up for success.”
Bowser said this policy will also ensure parents can choose a school that offers the best services for their students.
“We want to make it easier for every parent to choose a school that best fits their child’s needs,” Bowser said.
Charter school advocates have expressed concerns that the plan might negatively impact less-affluent regions, such as D.C.’s Ward 8, and undermine the concept of charter autonomy, which allows charter schools to determine their own admissions process.
Scott Pearson, the executive director of the D.C. Public Charter School Board, said he is still analyzing the implications of the new plan.
“It’s an interesting enrollment proposal that addresses real issues families face,” Pearson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “All preferences have complex effects so we’re speaking with school leaders and others to better understand their perspectives.”
D.C. Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large), chairman of the D.C. Council Committee on Education, said any effective policy will require significant time to implement.
“The proposal that was announced by the Mayor will require an amendment to the School Reform Act, which as you know, must be done through the legislative process,” Grosso wrote in an email to The Hoya. “My staff and I are currently analyzing the issues with the proposal and both the intended and unintended consequences of such a preference.”
Grosso said he may hold a public hearing this spring or summer to listen to constituent opinions.
Hoya Staff Writer Paula Hong contributed reporting.

Three potential tickets attended mandatory information sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday to participate in this year’s Georgetown University Student Association executive election.
Eleven eligible students, excluding campus media, attended the Wednesday meeting, including Habon Ali (SFS ’18), Jessica Andino (COL ’18), Alan Chen (COL ’18), Kamar Mack (COL ’19), Richie Mullaney (COL ’18), Brian Philipps (SFS ’18), Josh Sirois (SFS ’20), Garet Williams (MSB ’18) and Megan Yeager (COL ’19).
Sources close to the candidates confirm the likely presidential and vice presidential pairings of Chen and Philipps, Mack and Andino, and Williams and Ali.
Two of these pairings include current members of GUSA. Williams serves as a deputy chief of staff, while Ali is a senator for the East Campus district. Mack serves as the Secretary of Local Educational Affairs on the Federal and D.C. Relations Committee, and Andino is the GUSA undocumented student inclusivity policy team chair.
Last year’s campaign saw one official ticket, consisting of GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and GUSA Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17). The Wisemiller’s Hot Chick and Chicken Madness sandwiches and Reed Howard (SFS ’17) and Courtney Maduike (SFS ’17) ran write-in campaigns against the pair.
This year’s official campaign period begins Feb. 9. Candidates are allowed to campaign all day, Feb. 29.
At Tuesday’s session, Fisk said the candidates in attendance should make sure they are approaching the GUSA executive positions with the right intentions. Khan, Fisk and Assistant Dean for Student Engagement Erika Cohen-Derr addressed students at both information sessions.
“If you’re considering doing this, make sure it’s for the right reasons, because this is going to be a grueling year,” Fisk said. “You will regret doing it for the wrong reasons, if you jump into that, because it’s a lot of work. If you’re looking for popularity… on the contrary, you’re going to get criticized a lot.”
Khan said candidates should be prepared for what can be underappreciated work.
“It really helps students in really impactful ways,” Khan said. “There’s a lot of behind-the-scenes things GUSA does, so when students approach you and say ‘I’m having x issue, I need help,’ and it’s the things you don’t see in public that I think GUSA is most important for, so just really be ready.”
According to Cohen-Derr, who serves as GUSA’s faculty advisor, the executive positions are one of the most challenging and important leadership positions on campus.
“This is the most substantive — one of the most substantive — leadership roles you can have,” Cohen-Derr said. “It’s time-consuming. It’s demanding. It’s a lot behind the scenes. And you should aspire to do this for the best possible reasons. I hope your campaigns are conducted in that spirit.”
This election season will also allow impartial election polling stations. According to GUSA Election Commission Chair Alden Fletcher (SFS ’17), these new policies minimize bias and electioneering in campaigns.
“There will be — new this year — an election polling station,” Fletcher said. The purpose of this station is to encourage maximum voting participation by the student body.
The policies come after GUSA’s club funding reform referendum on Dec. 1 raised concerns of electioneering, after six members of the Vote No campaign alleged GUSA sought to garner votes at polling stations, among other complaints. On Jan. 20, the GUSA Constitutional Council ruled the referendum results to be invalid, citing GUSA’s inability to provide students with timely notice of the proposal of a referendum.
On Tuesday, the GUSA senate passed a bill introducing independent voting stations and clarifying that GUSA bylaws concerning elections apply to referendum campaigns.
As with previous years, campaigns are allowed to “dorm storm” and knock on doors only outside of quiet hours, except for on election day when tickets can campaign all day.
The debates for vice presidential and presidential candidates will be held in room 101 of the Intercultural Center on Feb. 15 and in the Healey Family Student Center Great Room on Feb. 20.
Williams said his campaign is structured differently from past GUSA executive campaigns.
“We actually changed the way we campaign,” Williams said. “We’ve gone for a very non-hierarchical structure and organized it. So there’s not one centralized campaign manager, per se. Instead, we have been organized in terms of teams.”
Mack said his platform will likely focus on diversity and inclusivity on campus.
“A lot of the issues we want to tackle are urgent. We want to be the ticket that unifies the campus,” Mack said. “I think the political climate in the U.S. is very divisive. We want to sort of use GUSA as a platform to build community at Georgetown.”

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) predicted President Donald Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order on immigration would be overturned, as part of a series of criticisms of the order, in a talk sponsored by Georgetown University College Democrats Tuesday night.
“Friday’s action was a complete abdication of American originalism — the idea that this is a place where people can come from all over the world and become something unique,” Murphy said.
Murphy said he and his colleagues are taking a series of actions to counter the executive order, including pursuing legislation in the Senate to overturn the ban.
“As you know, there is a temporary stay that has been granted, and I believe that the ACLU will eventually prevail in court, at least with respect to non-refugee immigrants,” Murphy said.
Murphy said current law rules most clearly in favor of non-refugee immigrants, who he said should be protected by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.
“The 1965 law is absolutely clear: Immigration policy cannot discriminate based upon religion or country of origin. It’s not as clear as to whether that protection applies to refugees, but it certainly applies to individuals with green cards, with non-immigrant visas in this country,” Murphy said.
In light of last week’s National Democratic Committee Chair Debate on Jan. 14, wherein the seven candidates discussed the future of the party, Murphy said the Democratic party has to take a clear stance on the issues.
“We haven’t given voters a real clear idea of what we stand for in a while,” Murphy said. “We need to start with what we’re for. If we’re confident in what we’re for, that will tell us what we should fight and what we should let go.”
Murphy said his party can run on a simple economic message that appeals to all voter blocs.
“Economic growth for everybody, not just millionaires and billionaires, and a country that has a place for everyone. There you go. There’s a sentence that says what we are for as a party,” Murphy said. “It starts with what you’re for.”
According to Murphy, Congress is still able to pass effective legislation, citing the progress of mental health legislation in the last congress. Former President Barack Obama signed the Mental Health Reform Act of 2016 into law Dec. 13, which expanded federal resources for mental health. Murphy worked alongside Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) to garner 28 co-sponsors, 14 Republicans and 14 Democrats to pass the bill through Congress.
“In our rearview mirror, within thirty days, we were able to do big, bipartisan reform. That bill is going to change peoples’ lives. It’s going to result in hundreds of millions of dollars in new mental healthcare offered to people who used to be on the outside of that system,” Murphy said.
While Murphy expressed concerns over the partisan nature of the 115th United States Congress, he said positive change is still possible in this new political era.
“By and large, that same set of players that did that is still in Congress. So yes, you have available to you bipartisan compromise,” Murphy said. “Where does that come? Infrastructure. Tax reform. Those are places in which we can find some common ground.”
Murphy said it is important for Georgetown students, and youth across the country, to get involved in politics and effect change.
“You’ve got a moment in time now that matters. You saw that tweet that somebody sent out that said, ‘When you were in history class and you thought to yourself, boy, what would I have done if I were alive then?’” Murphy said. “Well, you’re alive right now. And what you choose to do is what you would have done then.”

Tom Keating says 
February 5, 2017 at 6:40 am
Mr. Murphy
Thank you for opposing Trumps policies. He is making America look like a banana republic

A former adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, Jack Vitayanon, was arrested and charged with conspiring to distribute illegal drugs Wednesday.
Vitayanon, an attorney for the Internal Revenue Service’s Office of Professional Responsibility, is accused of attempting to distribute 500 grams or more of methamphetamines in Arizona and New York. Federal prosecutors also alleged Vitayanon participated in a drug trafficking ring in both states from September 2014 to January of this year, according to a criminal complaint filed against him in a Brooklyn court.
An ethics instructor at GULC, Vitayanon’s public profile on the school’s website was pulled down following his arrest.
Mimi Koumanelis, executive director of communications for GULC, said Vitayanon is no longer a professor at the university.
“He is not employed by Georgetown,” Koumanelis wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He was on contract to teach a course in the fall of 2016, but is no longer affiliated with the University.”
Robert Capers, U.S. attorney for New York’s eastern district, released a statement on the arrest.
“A federal attorney working for the IRS’s Office of Professional Responsibility — broke bad and supplemented his income,” the statement reads.
According to an affidavit filed against Vitayanon, the recipient of a package of drugs was arrested, but agreed to cooperate with agents from the Department of Homeland Security. The source told authorities they had paid a meth distributor in Arizona around $8,600 for the shipment, and was referred to the distributor in 2014 by Vitayanon. DHS officials then used the source to negotiate a purchase with Vitayanon for an ounce of meth.
According to The Washington Post, law enforcement authorities found additional quantities of methamphetamine, drug paraphernalia and materials to distribute drugs after obtaining a search warrant.
A date still has not been set for a formal trial.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a series of electoral mistakes, while pollsters underestimated President Donald Trump’s support, according to Professor Samuel J. Potolicchio (COL ’04) in a talk in White-Gravenor Hall on Tuesday evening.
Potolicchio, the director of Global and Custom Education at the McCourt School of Public Policy, said at the event, sponsored by the Georgetown University College Republicans, Georgetown University College Democrats, foreign policy group Alexander Hamilton Society, Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition and the undergraduate think tank Roosevelt Institute, Trump’s victory was unexpected but not inexplicable.
According to Potolicchio, election night reports about a lack of participation leading to Trump’s victory were overstated because they failed to account for absentee ballots that were counted in many Western states after Nov. 8.
“The voting rate that was reported, that I think is seared into many of our brains, is 55 percent, which would’ve been the lowest in 20 years,” Potolicchio said. “But what did the voting turnout rate end up being? Just over 60 percent, which actually is the second best turnout rate since the 1960s.”
Even though the majority of exit poll participants said Clinton spoke more to their particular concerns and possessed better judgment, a plurality of citizens — 39 percent — wanted a president who would bring change. Potolicchio said that these citizens who prioritized change probably swung the election in Trump’s favor.
Potolicchio said that significant shortcomings in the Clinton camp contributed to her defeat. According to him, the main reason Clinton lost was because Obama’s diverse electoral coalition failed to rally behind her, especially women.
“Now you would expect this demographic to be a stronghold; this is someone who’s endeavoring to be the first female president of the country,” Potolicchio said. “But we saw indications of this in the primary, against Sanders. Sanders was actually clobbering her not only among the young, but among young women.”
Potolicchio also said rising Obamacare premiums, which Americans became aware of a week before the election, also made a greater percentage of citizens vote against Hillary.
“Many people got their new Obamacare premiums, and discontent with Obamacare spiked in the seven days before the election,” Potolicchio said. “It actually hit 58 percent that slightly or strongly disapproved of the Affordable Care Act.”
According to Potolicchio, a ‘shy Trump voter’ phenomenon came into play in states where Trump outperformed expectations. As a result of voters declining to say they supported Trump, his popularity was underestimated by polls.
“You would have white Democrats or Democrat-leaning Independents who, when they were polled on the phone, they would be embarrassed to say that they were supporting the white Republican, because that might indicate that they were racist,” Potolicchio said.
Clinton made strategic mistakes throughout her campaign, according to Potolicchio. He said Clinton’s advertising in the Rust Belt and other battleground states was inadequate, for attacks on Donald Trump ultimately detracted from her message and heightened the appeal of her opponent’s.
“In the week before the election, in the battleground states, 100 percent of Hilary Clinton ads mentioned Donald Trump,” Potolicchio said. “And only 10 percent of Donald Trump’s ads mentioned Clinton.”
However, despite a failure to win a majority of seats in the House and the Senate, Democrats performed better relative to the 2014 mid-term elections on the congressional level while Republicans performed worse, according to Potolicchio.
“If you look at the difference in the popular vote between 2016 and 2014 in the House of Representatives, the Democrats did about two points better, and the Republicans did two points worse,” Potolicchio said. “Republicans did 10 points worse from the 2014 Senatorial Elections and the Democrats did nine points better.”
According to Potolicchio, the Electoral College disproportionately benefits small, rural, Republican-dominated states on electoral outcomes. But, with half of the states falling in the category of small and rural, Potolicchio considers there to be little possibility for a shift to direct elections.
“California, just over 37,000,000 people, 55 electoral points, that means each electoral point is determined by 670,000 people approximately,” Potolicchio said. “You look at North Dakota, with a population of about 670,000, three electoral points, each electoral point is determined by 220,000.”
Potolicchio said it is impossible to predict the path of Trump’s presidency. However, he said conclusions could be drawn from Trump’s cabinet picks or his methodology for negotiating as described in Trump’s book, “The Art of the Deal.”
“One of the seminal negotiating tactics which he said has led to his ‘success’ is you throw out something ridiculous first,” Potolicchio said. “You knock your opponent out of their feet, and then you actually start to bargain.”

Health Education Services hosted #BreakTheStigma, an event featuring performances by student groups and activities, including a body image photo campaign, in the Healey Family Student Center yesterday as part of an effort to destigmatize mental illness.
The event sought to increase awareness of mental health resources on campus and to challenge the stigmas associated with mental health, according to Laura Marcucci, the health communications specialist and social norms program coordinator of HES.
“Because stigma can be a significant barrier for students engaging in dialogue or seeking help, we hope #BreakTheStigma will create a space to openly promote and celebrate support, conversation, and recovery,” Marcucci said. “During this ‘day party’ celebration, students and loved ones can stand in solidarity around these issues.”
Jennifer Wiggins, a staff clinician and sexual assault specialist in HES who led the #BreakTheStigma event last year, said the event aimed to foster conversation around mental health and other stigmatized issues facing Georgetown students.
“It is our hope that the event not only starts the dialogue for some members of our community, but also serves to normalize dialogue around these topics and celebrate the successes of those who are healing from these issues,” Wiggins wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Wiggins said she hopes the program can ease the intimidation factor for students wanting to seek help.
“The Georgetown community is moving to a better understanding of the importance of overall wellness,” Wiggins wrote. “There are many advocates, allies, activists, and survivors on our campus, however, there is always room for improvement. The community is very open to learning and supporting those impacted by the issues addressed at the #BTS event.”
Mental health advocacy group Active Minds President Victoria Smith (COL ’18) said the club is excited to be a part of the event in order to start a conversation around de-stigmatizing mental health.
“Active Minds is going to be doing a pledge for how you break the stigma, so people can say, you know, ‘I break the stigma by going to Active Minds events,’ or, ‘I break the stigma by posting articles about people talking about their mental health experiences.’”
Dipali Gupta (MSB ’17) said the event helped her discover new services.
“I just walked around the tables and heard people give their spiels … I didn’t know there was a veterans’ society, or [that] different groups like the [Center for Multicultural Equity & Access] group talked about mental health specifically related to them,” Gupta said.
Smith said she thinks the program will have an even bigger impact this year than in previous years, given the new efforts that incorporated more performers and speakers.
“It’s for people to get more information about eating disorders or about like how where they can go deal with mental health issues,” Smith said. “It’s also a celebration of resilience. When you hear people sort of talking about these issues in a positive light, it helps people realize that they can get help. There are others going through some of the same things they’re going through, and there is a community there that’s going to support them.”

The first research team Georgetown sent to Antarctica returned Dec. 23 from a trip, marking them the first ever research team to bring next generation DNA sequencing technology to the continent.
The purpose of the mission — to look for signs of life in extreme temperatures — helped support their theorizing about long-term cell survival as well as insights into the possibilities of extraterrestrial life.
The team of five was led by principal investigator Sarah Stewart Johnson, an assistant professor of planetary science in Georgetown’s department of biology and science, technology, and international affairs program. The team also included two biologists — Scott Tighe, scientific leader of the Extreme Microbiome Project and research scientist at University of Vermont Cancer Center and undergraduate biology student, Angela Bai (COL ’17). Joining them was Elena Zaikova, a postdoctoral fellow in the Johnson Lab and David Goerlitz, director of operations for the Genomics and Epigenomics Shared Resource at the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.
Johnson received a grant through the National Science Foundation to travel to Antarctica to conduct the experiments.
“We all worked together: completing the field work, processing the samples back in the lab and setting up the sequencers,” Johnson said. “The sun never sets in Antarctica during the summer, and we worked around the clock. It was intense.”
The team flew by helicopter to and from the McMurdo Station, the main U.S. research base, to the McMurdo Dry Valleys where they tested their theories of long-term cell survival of extremophiles. Extremophiles are organisms that thrive in physically and geochemically extreme conditions.
The lakes and ponds in the valleys are permanently covered in ice, are hypersaline, meaning they contain high levels of salt that surpass ocean levels. The researchers collected “paleomats,” layers of microbial communities that were naturally freeze-dried under the lakes between 2,000 and 50,000 years ago. Since then, the lakes have receded and the mats are buried in the soil.
Goerlitz said that their research is important in gaining information about life outside of Earth.
“The Dry Valleys are extremely cold and hyper-arid polar deserts and are the closest of any terrestrial environment on Earth to the planet Mars, and thus provide an important source of insights into possible extraterrestrial life,” Goerlitz said.
Bai emphasized the importance of this trip for opening opportunities to conduct research in new, unknown places as well as testing for the technology.
“The expedition was pretty important because Antarctica was the final frontier for DNA sequencing, which has now officially been done on all seven continents and in space,” Bai said. “We also demonstrated that sequencing instruments could still work even when they’re not being coddled in an indoors lab, which opens up a whole bunch of opportunities for doing macromolecule analysis in places like Mars.”
Bai, the only undergraduate on the trip, said that although they have not yet conducted extensive data processing or analysis, their preliminary data shows the long genetic sequences they were expecting, thereby proving their methods effective.
“We can use data about the community in its native environment to answer questions about how any living thing could possibly survive in environments different from our own,” Bai said. “Our field season was very successful despite having to rely on chance and luck for digging our holes in the right places.”
Using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION, the data demonstrates the researchers have isolated and sequenced DNA over 68,000 base pairs long from ancient microbial samples around 10,000 years old.
The team is looking toward working on processing and analyzing the data at Georgetown labs once the samples from sites in the Dry Valleys arrive in the coming weeks.
Goerlitz expressed gratitude not only that their trip was scientifically beneficial, but also for the team as a whole.
“We all have our own skill set, and we combined these rather well to complete our mission,” Goerlitz said. “We worked very closely each day in the lab, we flew in the helicopter together, worked in the field together, ate meals together, were roommates in our small dorm rooms, so it was an intense time, but we worked really well together.”

After two years of planning, approval and construction, the university completed renovations on about 22,000 square feet of the Car Barn’s first floor this month, creating a new graduate student lounge and providing space for the Georgetown University Press and the university’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
The new lounge, located in the southwest corner of the building, features custom fabricated floor-to-ceiling glass windows that increase window space by replacing former garage doors. The university also has plans to make further renovations to departmental offices located in the Car Barn.
“We’re trying to accomplish many things. One is it consolidated other lease space to make us more efficient,” Vice President of Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said. “It provided space for graduate student growth, some graduate student common space and study-collaboration space and we’ve also got space in there that we call swing space.”
The new swing space in the Car Barn will be used to temporarily house other programs or departments currently located elsewhere in the Car Barn so that their offices can also be renovated.
“The intent is that we get more efficient,” Morey said. “And in order to do that, you need to move those people somewhere. So we also have a small area that’s for swing space so that we can go in and strategically renovate other parts of the Car Barn in the future.”
One of the major drivers of the renovation project, according to Morey, was GU Press’ expiring lease at its previous office location, 3240 Prospect St. NW. The lease expired in November and the GU Press staff moved into the Car Barn on Nov. 21.
When the Car Barn’s owner, Douglas Development Corporation, listed space on the first floor of the building about two years ago, the university negotiated a contract to lease it. At the time, Douglas Development was also attempting to attract a retailer to the available first-floor space.
Prior to Georgetown’s lease two years ago, the university was using the first floor of Car Barn as garage space, according to Morey.
Alongside the student lounge, the Government Master’s program in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences relocated its offices to the newly renovated Car Barn space from the Intercultural Center. The increased space for the Graduate School falls in line with the university’s plan to increase the size of the Graduate School over the next two decades.
“The university has aspirations to expand the Graduate School,” Morey said. “If you look at our campus plan, we’re looking to grow our graduate program over the next 10 to 20 years by 2,000 students. At least, that’s what we requested in the plan and have approved. So, obviously those folks need a home.”
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Norberto Grzywacz said the complex nature of issues that graduate students study requires collaborative work, which the newly renovated space in the Car Barn helps to stimulate.
“In addition, the design of the new space will encourage these unique programs to interact with each other,” Grzywacz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Thus, the new space is an essential part of an important innovation in higher education. This innovation turns a good portion of a university scholarly production outwards towards society.”
According to proposals submitted in November 2016 to the Old Georgetown Board, an advisory committee of architects appointed by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, a federal entity, the Graduate School also plans to add signage to the M Street and Prospect Street entrances to the Car Barn reading, “Georgetown University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.”
Georgetown University Press Publicity and Exhibits Manager Jackie Beilhart said the new GU Press office is a step up from the former space. Not only is the new office closer to campus, but it includes an elevator, unlike the former lease. Furthermore, Beilhart said that the university made sure to modify the office to ensure higher-than-average air quality.
“Since the space is brand new, it’s definitely very nice and very well put-together whereas our last place hadn’t been renovated in a bit,” Beilhart said. “Certainly, just having a new place in general has been really lovely.”

Pro-abortion rights group H*yas for Choice announced the Condom Fairy Delivery Service on Jan. 29, a new service designed to provide students with greater access to condoms and other forms of contraception.
The new program allows students living in on-campus housing to request up to 10 condoms or dental dams to be delivered to their door on any Friday. Students may choose whether or not to include their name on the form.
Though only launched on the HFC Facebook page this week, the Condom Fairy Delivery Service has already seen at least 45 requests for condom deliveries. The first batch of deliveries is scheduled to go out today.
H*yas for Choice, which is unrecognized by the university, is currently the only provider of contraception on campus, primarily through daily tabling in both Red Square and Sellinger Lounge. Because they receive no funding from the university, all condoms are delivered by volunteer members of the HFC general body.
The idea for the delivery service came from H*yas for Choice leadership team member Mika Skibinksky (COL ’19) when she noticed the difficulty some students have approaching the HFC table and asking for contraception.
“I was tabling for HFC one day and this awkward, yet brave freshman came up to the table and asked if they could take some condoms. I could tell that they really worked up the courage to approach the table, especially after seeing them accidentally dropping condoms as they left,” Skibinsky wrote in an email to The Hoya. “So shout out to that freshman and all those shy people out there. This program was made for you.”
HFC President Emily Stephens (SFS ’17) said while the group is invested in making contraception more accessible, the group also wants to destigmatize the usage of contraception.
“We recognize some students require anonymity to feel comfortable accessing our condoms, and in the short-term we want to reduce those barriers as much as possible,” Stephens wrote in an email to The Hoya. “However, part of our programming around sexual health also attempts to destigmatize sex, sexual health, and healthy relationships, so that ultimately members of the Georgetown community won’t feel any awkwardness acquiring or discussing sex and contraception.”
Some student groups oppose the service, saying it has the potential to undermine certain values Georgetown is responsible for upholding as a Jesuit institution. According to Grand Knight of the Knights of Columbus Hunter Estes (SFS ’19), who is also a member of anti-abortion rights group GU Right to Life, Georgetown has a duty to maintain a culture of life, which invariably necessitates promoting an anti-abortion message.
“I find this new program to be yet another link in the chain of destructive actions that devalue the culture of life that Georgetown is meant to uphold,” Estes wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Estes also said he sees the potential for abuse with this program, stating that he has already heard of instances in which individuals have ordered condoms to be sent to members of the anti-abortion community, as a form of harassment.
“This new program gives people the ability to anonymously harass and abuse the pro-life minority of students,” Estes wrote. “To me, the program serves to further undermine the Catholic values on which Georgetown was founded, and promote a reckless culture that disregards the consequences of one’s actions.”
Despite this backlash, members of H*yas for Choice are optimistic about the future of the service. Skibinksky said she is hopeful about the program’s success.
“I’d say that the response has been good so far,” Skibinsky wrote in. “We just started, but hopefully things will run smoothly.”

This is scandalous in the most heinous sense!  “Hate the sin, & love the sinner” is what Jesus Christ and His one true Church teaches (with His authority).  Becoming slaves to sin deprives one of TRUE human freedom, and jeopardizes one’s eternal salvation.
Pro-choice (same as pro-abortion) rights groups have no place existing on a FAITHFUL Catholic University’s campus, and GU has created too much scandal over the decades.  The Catechism (does the university encourage its reading, or have any GU students ever read parts of it?) defines scandal as an “attitude or behavior that leads another to do evil.”
TRUTH is the mind’s conformity with reality. It is not difficult to see why people today have difficulty with such a basic concept because all falsehoods, including all forms of relativism, are mental deviations from reality. 
Truth, especially religious truth, makes demands upon us. To say that everything is relative so that we can do whatever we want is a serious violation of our responsibility as persons. Truth’s obligatory nature is an essential aspect of truth. All authentic truth comes from God, who wants us to know and understand His truth, so we can embrace it and live by it. 
Jesus Christ reminds us, “The truth shall make you free” (Jn 8:32). He also said, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me” (Jn 146). Truth is a Person!
The real purpose of the university is not about the free expression of ideas–IT IS ABOUT THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH.  Students rights to the free expression of immoral, unrealistic, or eccentric ideas do not belong in a university, but in a public park or a private venue.  Georgetown has fallen away from forming its students with a solid, moral and ethical Catholic foundation that prepares students to discern  truth later in life, and to evangelize a fallen world, as Christ has commanded us to do.
Academic freedom must be practiced within the confines of the truth and the common good.  A Catholic university’s obligation is to search for and teach truth, which includes the truth of the sacredness of human life, the evils of abortion, contraception, and euthanasia, as well as the unnatural, immoral behavior of LGBTQ
Considering Georgetown’s moral and ethical hypocrisy over the past few decades, the university may claim to be pro-life, but yet invites the head of Planned Parenthood, or Kathleen Sebelius of HHS, to speak publicly to students to promote abortion.  The use of condoms promotes promiscuity, degrades the dignity of the human person, affects the stability of future marriages, and blocks the natural transmission of human life!  Do you not know that the Church has condemned the use of artificial contraception?  Or, do you not care?
When people say one should not judge, ‘judge not’ does not mean we ignore evil! Jesus did not tell us we should close our eyes to moral evil in the world. He expects His followers to acknowledge the difference between good and bad conduct in themselves, and others. Although He wants us to be forgiving and merciful to others, He does not want us to ignore, much less approve, immoral behavior. Admonishing the sinner is a spiritual work of mercy much needed in today’s broken world.
To get an idea of the scope of this overall problem, attached is an article from The Cardinal Newman Society that speaks to GU’s dissenting Catholic “identity”, and the Canon Law case against GU.

I believe Ms. Roberts here just violated the first bullet of the Hoya’s official comments policy.
“1. Comments may not include inappropriate content. The Hoya deems a comment to be inappropriate if it:
degrades others on the basis of gender, race, class, ethnicity, national origin, religion, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, disability or other classification”
LGBTQ members of society are not unnatural or immoral. I’m sorry you are uncomfortable with decisions made by consenting adults. 
Great job h*yas for choice! I think it is very brave of you all to gather behind a cause in an environment as unsupportive as Georgetown’s. Hopefully they will pull through soon!

A very important, friendly response to Mr. Weiss’ comments above needs truthful clarification, for the benefit of all concerned, especially at a Catholic university.  
No offense or violation of Hoya comments policy was intended, only the truth!   It is important to realize that the TRUTH is not concerned with how many it persuades. 
‘Sexual orientation’ used in my comments implies illicit sexual behavior at GU in the eyes of God, Who is Truth.  My intent was not to degrade anyone with homosexual inclinations.  It is very important to understand the following, because there is hope.
The Catechism of the Catholic Church, which speaks with the authority of Jesus Christ, does not degrade those who have homosexual inclinations.  
The USCCB, Ministry to Persons with a Homosexual Inclination (2006), p.13, states, “The Church seeks to enable every person to live out the universal call to holiness.  Persons with a homosexual inclination ought to receive every aid and encouragement to embrace this call personally and fully.  This will unavoidably involve much struggle and self-mastery, for following Jesus always means following the way of the Cross….  The Sacraments of the Eucharist and of Penance are essential sources of consolation and aid on this path.”
“Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart, and you will find rest for your selves.  For my yoke is easy, and my burden light.” (Matthew 11:28-30).  USCCB quote.
According to catholic.com, an orthodox Catholic website:  “Every human being is called to receive a gift of divine sonship (includes daughtership), to become a child of God by grace.  However, to receive this gift, we must reject sin, including homosexual BEHAVIOR–that is, acts intended to arouse or stimulate a sexual response regarding a person of the same sex.  The Catholic Church teaches that such acts are always violations of divine and natural law.
Homosexual desires, however, are not in themselves sinful.  People are subject to a wide variety of sinful desires over which they have little direct control, but these do not become sinful until a person acts upon them, either by acting out the desire or by encouraging the desire and deliberately engaging in fantasies about acting it out.  People tempted by homosexual desires, like people tempted by improper heterosexual desires, are not sinning until they act upon those desires in some manner.
Homosexuals who want to live chastely can contact Courage, a national, Church-approved support group for help in deliverance from the homosexual lifestyle.”  See Catholic.com/tract/homosexuality.
If H*yas for Choice is encouraging homosexual behavior, especially at Georgetown University, a supposedly Catholic university, it needs to steer back to what our Catholic Church teaches.
