After the federal government unveiled an online cost comparison tool to help families manage the expenses of college education last week, the tool has drawn criticism from colleges for misrepresenting the amount of debt students are likely to incur.
The Financial Aid Comparison Shopper, which was released as a beta version by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, allows prospective students to compare up to three universities and calculates the student debt that will be incurred each year. It bases its calculations on the overall cost of attendance and subtracts the average value of scholarships and grants awarded to determine the amount of money that a student would need to borrow. “Now, more than ever, students and their families need to know before they owe,” CFPB director Richard Cordray said in a press release.
According to Scott Fleming, associate vice president for federal relations, the numbers that the website provides overestimate the actual debt incurred by attending Georgetown or similar institutions.
“I’ve talked to several of the associations of higher education institutions that we belong to and I think it is pretty broadly felt … that the data is confusing,” Fleming said, adding that it was unclear how theCFPB calculates costs.
The tool reports the expected amount of debt in terms of how many $50 textbooks it would cost every month to pay back the loan in 10 years. The construction of the website is part of an ongoing project between the CFPB and the Department of Education and provides data for more than 7,500 schools.
For Georgetown University, the site estimates that the average student would be required to take out over $27,000 in loans each year and would need to pay about $1,637, the equivalent of 33 textbooks, each month for the next 10 years in order to repay those loans.
According to Fleming, the average total student loan debt for Georgetown’s Class of 2011 was about $12,000, and the university’s Office of Student Financial Services limits the total cost of student loans to $17,500 for all four years when creating a financial aid packet. The online tool, however, estimates that students would be required to borrow more than six times that amount in a four-year period.
Tony Pals, director of communications at the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, echoed Fleming’s concerns.
“The website grossly overestimates the average yearly debt of students,” he said. “The number that you see for annual debt on the website would be the total debt of students after 4 or 5 years of study.”
Fleming said that it is possible that a student who does not qualify for financial assistance, and whose family does not wish to pay anything out-of-pocket, may borrow more than the estimated amount. He added that financial aid is a case-by-case issue and those averages are not representative of the actual cost of attendance.
Fleming expressed concern that the site may affect prospective students’ university choices because its launch coincides with the release of college acceptances.
“We think it’s really distorted, and quite frankly that’s frustrating,” he said. “[Prospective students] may look at this test site and get a very distorted sense of what it’s going to cost to go somewhere to college. That’s worrisome.”
Pals agreed, but also feels that the website may have some uses for prospective students.
“I do want to note that the website can be useful for comparing financial award letters,” he said. “The problem is in order to get to that part of the site you have to go through pages that are using inaccurate data.”

This semester, three Georgetown students attempted to gauge the values of the current college-aged generation through the Millennial Values Fellows program offered by the Berkeley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs.
The fellowship culminated in the Millennial Values Symposium, a conference for students around the country to discuss the intersection of faith and moral values among the Millennial generation, which began on campus Thursday and continues through today.
As part of the symposium, the Berkeley Center and the Public Religion Research Institute released a survey of 2,000 college-age Millennials about the moral and religious values that inspire young adults and how those values impact their political views and voting preferences.
“The survey … provides insights into younger Millennials’ outlook on the future and explores significant shifts between their current religious affiliation and the religious tradition in which they were raised,” Berkeley Center Director Thomas Banchoff wrote in an email.
According to the results, which were published Thursday, the majority of the Millennial generation, a group that self-identifies as more diverse than the overall American population, cites jobs and unemployment as critical issues facing the United States.
The demographic also believes that economic reform is necessary to address economic disparities, wants at least some form of abortion to be legalized, supports gay marriage and advocates granting permanent legal status to undocumented immigrants through the DREAM Act.
Millennials are more divided, however, over their belief in the concept of the American Dream, their identification with political parties and who they currently favor for the 2012 presidential election.
“We’re getting a broad-based picture of what 20-somethings across the country think or believe in,” Millennial Fellow Colin Steele (SFS ’12) said. “The point will be to say … this is us, as we stand here at the cusp of taking some of our own authorship and ownership in decision-making, policy-making and leadership. We’re making a statement about what a sample of thoughtful 20-somethings say is important to us.”
College-aged Millennials are also divided in their thoughts about current racial tensions. According to the survey, 46 percent believe that the government has paid too much attention to the problems of minorities in the past decade, while 48 percent agree that discrimination against whites is as big a societal problem as discrimination against blacks.
“The goal is to get a better understanding of how our generation conceives of the intersection between politics, values and religion,” Millennial Fellow Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) said. “For our generation, there are a lot of conflicts with that intersection that have escalated. We have a vested interest in talking about why that intersection has come to the forefront of our lives.”
The 16 Millennial Values Fellows, students from universities across the United States, were chosen through a national competition after submitting blog posts reflecting a strong stance on issues affecting their generation.
In addition to the formal discussions, fellows are invited to a panel featuring authors Joshua Foer and Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts and founder of the Christian social justice organization Sojourners Jim Wallis, as well as a dinner with University President John J. DeGioia and Special Olympics CEO Tim Shriver.
The Berkeley Center plans to continue the dialogue by conducting another survey and repeating the fellowship program next fall.
According to Millennial Fellow Aamir Hussain (COL ’14), the survey and conference will demonstrate that the values of the current college generation are changing and diverse.
“It’s good to show that every generation is not monolithic,” he said. “They have different values.”

Ten Georgetown students have been awarded Fulbright scholarships thus far in this year’s selection process.
The recipients, who include seven seniors and three graduate students or recent alumni, will use their scholarships to study in eight countries on four continents, from sites in Jordan and Malaysia to Brazil and Kosovo.
The Fulbright Program, which is run through the U.S. State Department, awards about 7,500 grants each year to recognize academic merit and leadership potential as well as to fund research initiatives.
Scholarship announcements will continue through the end of June.
The Fulbright Program comprises multiple grant categories based on applicants’ goals and interests. The core program enables applicants to pursue either a full-time research program abroad or teach while conducting side research projects. Additional scholarships allow winners to teach abroad or enable foreign students to study in the United States.
Last year, Georgetown nabbed a record 22 Fulbrights, placing it among the top producers of award winners in the nation. Thirteen of the 22 had been announced by April 25.
Stephen Szypulski (SFS ’12), who will study in Poland, decided to apply for the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program after studying abroad in Warsaw during the spring of his junior year.
His research proposal will allow him to study the evolution of the Catholic Church in Poland and its response to 21st-century issues.
“My undergraduate career has mostly focused on Eastern Europe, Poland, Russia and Ukraine,” Szypulski said. “This program is a good way to use my languages, Polish and Russian, in a region and culture I’m very interested in.”
Alexandra Dudziuk (SFS ’12), who studied abroad with Szypulski at the Warsaw School of Economics, has been accepted to the Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Program. Dudziuk, who will be teaching in Poland, expects the Fulbright Program to offer her a different perspective on living abroad.
“Study abroad is one experience, but I’m looking forward to study abroad being something completely different, because I won’t be with a full group of Americans,” she said.
Cecily Raynor (GRD ’12), who was granted a Fulbright Scholarship to study contemporary Brazilian literature at the University of Brasilia, believes the funding and extra time is necessary for dissertation research and projects.
“Do research on the country you want to go to and all the universities in that country, and find somewhere really dependable that will offer support,” she said as advice to future applicants.
Other recipients so far include Johanna Caldwell (SFS ’12), Derek Dangerfield (COL ’12), Dudziuk, Shirley Lung (GRD ’12), Laura Molloy (COL ’11), Elizabeth Saam (SFS ’12), Sarah Stodder (COL ’12), Szypulski and Alyssa Warren (SFS ’12).

Tonight, a year of work by those involved with Relay For Life will come to fruition in an all-night celebration honoring cancer survivors and recognizing strides made toward finding a cure.
Relay For Life was first brought to Georgetown in 2006 in the organization’s largest inaugural collegiate event. Since then, the university has raised almost $1.9 million, and Georgetown has consistently been among the highest fundraising collegiate relays in the country.
This year, 155 teams made up of 1,712 participants will participate in Relay. Teams have collectively raised a total of about $185,000.
Last year, Relay had raised more than $300,000 by the time of the event. According to Co-chair DJ Wise (COL ’13), fundraising got off to a slow start this year.
“We have noticed that people have been waiting to fundraise until the end,” he said. “We want people to know that cancer does not wait. The more money we raise now, the more lives we save.”
Relay teams formed by student organizations are the event’s main source of fundraising. Hoya Blue is this year’s biggest fundraiser, having raised more than $12,000. The team’s captain, Rachel Carrig(COL ’13) ,is also the top individual fundraiser for the event with almost $8,000 raised.
Although the event occurs in the spring, Relay is a year-long process. Planning in the fall involves recruitment, publicity and meetings with representatives of university facilities, external relations and the Department of Public Safety.
“Right after Relay, we start planning for the next relay,” Wise said.
The university partners with organizations at other schools, focusing this year on a competition to raise more money than Syracuse University. Student groups, like the College Democrats and College Republicans, often challenge each other to fundraise as well.
All of the money raised for the event goes to the American Cancer Society. ACS then divides it into three categories — cancer research, caregiving for cancer patients and advocacy focusing on legislative action. Funds for caregiving go to support Hope Lodges, free hotels where cancer patients can stay if they have to travel for treatments. Georgetown’s Relay program visits a lodge in Baltimore a few times each year.
Relay For Life gets almost half of its funding through the President’s Office, Students of Georgetown, Inc., the Center for Social Justice and What’s After Dark. The American Cancer Society also helps to pay for the event.
According to Wise, Georgetown’s costs are half of what Relay programs in other parts of the country incur.
“The goal every time we have to take money is to turn that into more money. For every dollar we take, we want to turn that into two dollars to give back to Relay,” Co-Chair Ryan Muldoon (COL ’13) said.
According to organizers though, at the end of the day, success is not about the amount of money raised.
“Everything we do is mission-based. It is about making a difference in people’s lives and helping people to find the reason why they relay,” Matt Archambault (COL ’14), Relay For Life co-chair, said.

The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts approved preliminary plans for the university’s Athletic Training Facility during its monthly meeting Thursday.
According to the commission’s secretary, Thomas Luebke, the board approved the building’s location, overall shape and intended use as well as its architectural relationship to surrounding buildings.
The two-story, 125,000-square-foot building is slated to be built adjacent to McDonough Arena. Its ground floor will house practice space, office suites and locker rooms for the men’s and women’s basketball teams, while the lower level will provide a weight room, training room, equipment room, team meeting space and additional locker rooms for other student athletes.
The commission also provided comments regarding further development of the design and discussed, but did not vote on, plans for the exterior of the facility.
“What was not on the table today was an approval of the outside … architecture of the building,”Luebke said.
The university must now incorporate the commission’s suggestions into current plans. Revisions must be submitted to the Old Georgetown Board, an advisory commission that reviews projects on behalf of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts.
Plans for the ATF were approved by the OGB when they were put before the board last week for the third time.
Initial designs for the building were approved by the D.C. Zoning Commission during the 2000 Campus Plan process and by the OGB in 2006, but the project had to be resubmitted after being put on hiatus during the 2008 financial crisis.

Georgetown University Right to Life held its 16th annual Pregnancy Resource Forum, which discussed current university resources available for pregnant students and student parents, Tuesday afternoon.
President of Feminists for Life of America Serrin Foster moderated the panel of university administrators that focused on health, counseling and spiritual issues. Foster moderated the nation’s first pregnancy resource forum at Georgetown in 1997. The format she developed with Georgetown students and faculty serves as a nationwide model for similar discussions at hundreds of other universities.
Alison Goldberg, assistant director of Hoya Kids, the on-campus day care center for 58 children of students, staff and faculty, opened the discussion explaining childcare opportunities available on campus. While Hoya Kids only accepts children older than 18 months, Goldberg explained that the center actively works to support current student parents.
“We want student parents to know that we are completely and fully open and understanding of all of the issues that are related to being a student parent on campus,” she said.
Donnae Thomas (COL‘13) shared her experiences as a student parent with the approximately twenty panel attendees, made up of both Right to Life members and other interested students.
“The most difficult part for me is finances, because for the most part, I am a full time student,” Thomas said. “I work part time for Health and Wellness and sometimes at the Yates Pro Shop.” Thomas enrolls in four classes per semester and is the primary caretaker for her 5-year old son Calvin.
Director of Residential Ministry Michelle Siemietkowski praised Thomas for her dedication to raising Calvin amid challenges.
“There’s no such thing as a part-time parent,” Siemietkowski said. “She’s a full-time mother and a full-time student. It’s full-time love.”
Director of Health Education Services Carol Day proposed the idea for a flexible spending account for university administrators to aid student parents in crisis situations. While many details of the proposal remain murky, the panelists and forum attendees agreed the idea should be pursued.
Another idea raised at the forum was the creation of a wish list for student mothers to request school supplies and other expensive necessities.
“This is an easy thing we can do,” Foster said.

Building upon early popularity, the GU Farmers Market grew to incorporate new vendors and aims to expand its outreach and educational efforts this year.
This semester has brought four new vendors selling products that include homemade crafts, kettle corn, fresh meats and gluten-free desserts. Whole Foods will also provide cooking demonstrations every other Wednesday.
This season also will also include a speaker series titled “Fresh Foods, Fresh Thoughts.” The market will feature lectures by Georgetown professors on April 25.
“We are piloting. We are probably going to do one or two lectures and see where it goes to see if we want to continue it next semester,” Donald said.
Gadsden hopes that subjects explored by these speakers will vary from the theology or philosophy of food to sustainability and agricultural issues. The new Dean of the Science, Technology and International Affairs program Timothy Beach is lined up as a potential lecturer.
The market’s leadership, Bre Donald (NHS ’12) and Melissa Gadsden (NHS ’12), decided to move the weekly event, which will be set up every Wednesday until May 9, on Copley Lawn. The pair decided to move th e market from the Healy Circle to the edge of Red Square beginning this semester.
“Although Healy Circle is what you see right when you walk into the gates, Red Square is really a busier spot and definitely more of the heart of campus,” Gadsden said.
The pair noted, however, that Healy Circle was more accessible for the vendors, who now have to unload their goods behind White-Gravenor Hall and then park their trucks next to McDonough Arena.
The change in location has made it more challenging to include food trucks, a staple of the market last semester. The team is hoping that the trucks, which included Sauca and Sweetflow, will participate in future markets by parking outside of the front gates.
While outside companies currently comprise of all the market’s offerings, Donald and Gadsden hope to open up opportunities for students to sell goods as well.
Initially a project of the 2011 ReImagine Georgetown grant, the market also secured funding from the Georgetown University Student Association when it launched last spring. This year, the market has secured additional funding from a variety of sources, including the Office of the President and continued support from GUSA.
As the farmers market grows, organizers plan to charge vendors $60 per week to supplement the outside funding.
“The goal is to make the market more sustainable and less reliant on GUSA money,” Gadsden said.
Gadsden and Donald will graduate at the end of this semester and are searching for new leadership for the project, which they began work on last fall.
“Because we are both graduating, we have had a leadership meeting for the transitional role. There are about five people who are going to take over the market as [it] expands to more community and philanthropic work in the city,” Donald said.
Donald hopes that the market will continue to expand.
“Although a ton of students might not buy groceries regularly, they might start incorporating that into their food schedules,” she said. “I really think it is only going to keep on growing.”

MBA students will pick either the HOYA Clinic, Hoya Outreach Programs & Education or the Center for Social Justice to receive $15,000 Friday as part of a community service program launched by the McDonough School of Business.
MBA student Robert Wright, who is vice president of community service for the Evening Student Government Association in the MSB, spearheaded the project as a way to engage in active fundraising and create camaraderie among the graduate programs.
“It is really hard to prioritize charitable giving,” he said. “If we can do a great thing by raising money and do it in a way that gives people an opportunity to talk about this, that would be an outcome that would benefit not only the current group receiving the funds, but also help Georgetown students to inform their future giving as well.”
The goal of the ModFour campaign, which was named after the module system that divides academic terms in the business school, is to raise $10,000. Participants will solicit donations primarily from graduate business school students, but Wright hopes to reach out to Georgetown undergraduates and faculty as well. The Office of Advancement also announced today that an anonymous donor has volunteered to contribute $5,000 to the campaign. At the end of the fundraising period, the money will be given to the winner of Friday’s vote.
Development Coordinator of the HOYA Clinic Liz Truelove said that the clinic relies on outside funding in order to continue its services in Southeast D.C.
“As a totally volunteer-driven group, we absolutely rely on grants and fundraisers like this to keep everything running,” she said. “I didn’t even hesitate and we got right in the running.”
Ray Shiu, associate director of CSJ, said that he would put the $15,000 awarded to the ModFour winner toward extending the center’s summer programs in D.C. elementary schools, while HOPE Chair Ivana Robinson (MSB ’13) said that the winnings from ModFour would allow the organization, which runs the Mobile Soup Kitchen and organizes Georgetown’s annual Hunger and Homelessness Week, to reach a wider range of individuals across the D.C. area.
“With a lot of our programs, the problem isn’t [not] having enough volunteers. The problem is that we only have enough funds to give out a certain [number] of meals per week,” Robinson said. “The money would allow us to reach these people and even expand our programs into other neighborhoods.”

About 20 members of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee protested alleged labor rights abuses by Georgetown licensee Adidas in front of University President John J. DeGioia’s office Wednesday afternoon.
According to GSC member and demonstration organizer Samuel Geaney-Moore (SFS ’12), Adidas failed to pay workers of an apparel factory in Tangerang, Indonesia that closed in March the $1.8 million they are owed in severance pay. Georgetown’s Code of Conduct for Licensees states that the university’s licensees must provide terminal compensation for all of its contractors. According to Geaney-Moore, Adidas is therefore in violation of the university’s code.
The protesters presented a letter addressed to DeGioia and met with Joseph Ferrara, his chief of staff, in the Philodemic Room.
“It was a very cordial, respectful meeting,” Ferrara said. “I know they’re serious, and I respected that.”
According to Ferrara, the concerns of the student protesters have been shared with DeGioia, who was in a meeting at the time of the demonstration, as well as Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming and university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr.
The issue of labor rights in Indonesia was raised at Tuesday’s meeting of the university’s Licensing Oversight Committee, which is currently chaired by Fleming and has several student members. The committee spoke with a representative of Adidas Tuesday and is investigating whether the company is violating the university’s code of conduct.
“We are in the midst of those conversations,” Fleming said.
He noted that terminating Georgetown’s contract with Adidas is ultimately a legal decision. He is attempting to arrange a meeting with the university’s counsel by next week.
According to Geaney-Moore, the university has known about the issue for several months. GSC members chose to protest today after a week of planning in hopes of having the problem addressed by the end of the semester.
“For months, we’ve been talking about this at the university through the more quiet channels,” Geaney-Moore said.
Ferrara said that the Office of the President welcomes all student concerns and plans to have the appropriate members of the administration investigate the claims made by the GSC by next week.
“The door’s always open, and I was happy to meet with them,” Ferrara said.
