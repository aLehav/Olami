With a 17.7 percent acceptance rate, the application process to become a Blue & Gray tour guide this year was only slightly less competitive than getting into Georgetown itself.
The process, which involved both an application and an interview, began early on the morning of Sept. 11, when dozens of students lined up outside the Office of Undergraduate admissions to submit their applications. The organization only guaranteed interviews to the first 100 applicants, so tour guide hopefuls arrived early to stake out a spot in the line.
“I got [to White Gravenor] at 7:30 a.m.” said Ian Lundy (MSB ’15), a newly inducted tour guide.  “Everyone at Georgetown loves our school and is passionate and would show up at a regular time, but waking up early and being there is a small way to help them see I am willing to go to the next level.”
Sapir Yarden (SFS ’15), a current Blue & Gray tour guide, commented on her experience applying last year.
“One of my friends was the first person there. He arrived at 6 a.m., and he got [an interview], obviously. I showed up at 7:45 a.m. … and there was already a line out the door,” she said.
This enthusiasm translated into an extremely competitive admissions process for the program. The number of new positions available was limited by the number of Blue & Gray veterans who signed up as mentors to train new tour guides for their first semester in the program. This year, the organization received 33 mentor applications and was consequently able to accept 32 of its 180 applicants.
Although there were only 100 interview spots guaranteed for new tour guides, the Blue & Gray board members read all of the applications, according to president Meg Luther (COL ’13). The board then extended interview offers to exceptional candidates from a waitlist made up of those who were not among the first 100 students to turn in an application.
“I think it’s great,” said Sheila Walsh (COL ’14), a current Blue & Gray guide.  “I think it speaks to how competitive the process is and how enthusiastic the applicants are.” Students who weren’t accepted to the program also remarked on the organization’s selectivity.
“I tried not to think about it too much when I didn’t get picked because I realized that there were so many people that applied,” said Caroline Vetrano (MSB ’13), who applied for a position this year but was not accepted.  “I just figured that, when push came to shove, I didn’t get picked.  It was what it was.”
Though the opportunity to give tours of campus is the main draw for applicants, the organization is also working on building a sense of community among its members.
“We know we do a great job in giving tours, but we really want to have our community,” Walsh said. “I think they’re prioritizing really building and strengthening the culture between the guides.”
According to Luther, the fact that Blue & Gray tour guides are not paid fosters a special kind of enthusiasm for the job.
“At other universities, being a tour guide is a part-time job,” she wrote in an email.  “At Georgetown, it’s much more than that.  It’s a chance for current students to get to share with prospectives all of the amazing parts of life on the Hilltop.”
For many in Blue & Gray, guiding prospective students is a responsibility that should not be taken lightly.
“In a way, I feel like I’m helping them to make a decision that’s informed, whether or not they decide to apply to Georgetown,” Walsh said.

A panel of leading campaign analysts and media experts discussed the major issues facing both presidential candidates before a large audience in Gaston Hall Monday afternoon.
The panel was organized by the Georgetown Public Policy Institute and moderated by GPPI professor E.J. Dionne.
“There was at first a neck-in-neck dynamic between the candidates, and now we’ve really moved away from that,” said panelist Dana Bash, who is  senior  congressional correspondent for CNN. “The only traditional battleground state Romney currently has a lead in is Missouri.”
Bill Burton, a senior strategist for the pro-Obama super PAC, Priorities USA, and Rob Collins, a senior partner at the public affairs firm Purple Strategies, also sat on the panel.
The three analysts debated the causes for the recent shifts in the race: Ma. Governor Mitt Romney is now three percentage points behind President Obama in the polls.
Burton offered an explanation for Romney’s decrease in success.
“One of the key victories for the Democratic Party was that Obama was able to define Mitt Romney before Mitt Romney was able to define himself,” he said.
But Collins argued that the upcoming debate will help Romney.
“Twenty-three percent [of voters] have said that the debates will be crucial to their decision,” he said.
All three panelists referenced the effects of the early stages of fundraising and advertising.
“With the frequency of negative advertising being what it is, I think we really know one of the major factors of the political disillusionment that’s happening within younger generations,” Bash said.
Shweta Wahal (SFS ’16), a student who attended the event, said she appreciated the event’s bipartisan focus.
“It’s great having the opportunity to come and engage in these types of discussions,” Wahal said. “I can’t imagine not taking advantage of being in D.C. and having these types of professionals come to speak to us, especially during such a politically active time when the younger vote is so important.”

Graduates of the McDonough School of Business saw the second-highest rate of employment for the Class of 2011 among more than 240 undergraduate programs in the United States, according to a September study byNerdWallet Education.
Eighty-nine percent of the Class of 2011 landed jobs immediately after graduation, placing the MSB just below University of Massachusetts-Amherst’s School of Nursing, from which 92 percent of graduates found employment. The MSB placed three spots above Boston College’s Carroll School of Management, from which 86 percent of graduates found employment after graduation, and four above University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, from which 85 percent found employment.
NerdWallet Education based its study on schools that disclose their graduates’ employment rates.
Georgetown’s senior survey report from the Class of 2011, which NerdWallet used for its study of Georgetown, found that MSB graduates had the highest rate of employment among the four undergraduate schools. Fifty-two percent of graduates from Georgetown College, 69 percent of graduates from the Walsh School of Foreign Service and 74 percent of graduates from the School of Nursing and Health Studies were employed by graduation day.
However, a higher proportion of students from those schools went on to graduate or professional school. While only 5 percent of MSB graduates sought further education, 32 percent of College graduates, 14 percent of SFS graduates and 18 percent of NHS graduates went on to graduate or professional school.
According to Mike Schaub, executive director of the Cawley Career Education Center at Georgetown, the center provides MSB students with specialized tools in accordance with the unique challenges they face in finding employment.
“Interviewing for the finance and consulting fields can be particularly tricky, so the Career Center offers for new graduates seeking employment.
“Once a company hires a few Georgetown graduates and observes their exceptional job performance, the company works with the Career Center to enhance their campus presence and expand their recruiting efforts,” Schaub said. “The Career Center staff enjoys seeing alumni who are just a few years out of graduation return to the center to recruit their fellow Hoyas.”
MSB’s second-place ranking was consistent with the broader trends of the study, which found that graduates of specialized programs, such as business, nursing and engineering schools, had the highest rates of employment. Eighteen of the top 20 programs in the study were specialized and had an average of 84 percent employment.
Graduates of specialized programs were also found to have higher-than-average starting salaries. The mean starting salary for the MSB’s Class of 2011 was $61,802, whereas graduates of Georgetown College were paid an average of $48,664. Despite the disparity, graduates of both schools outearned their peers; according to the NerdWallet study, the average starting salary for business school graduates was $49,448, while graduates of more general arts and sciences programs earned an average of $40,194.

A team of Georgetown faculty members competed in a Ragnar Relay, raising $9,507 for Don BoscoCristo Rey High School this weekend.
Hoya Reycers, a team composed of 12 Georgetown faculty members, competed in the Ragnar Relay, an overnight race that covered 198.1 miles from Cumberland, Md., to the National Harbor in D.C.
The team aims to raise $10,000 for Don Bosco High School in Takoma Park, Md., before the donation period ends in early October. The school is part of the larger Cristo Rey network of Jesuit high schools, which includes 25 private Catholic high schools across the country that help urban and low-income youth prepare for college and employment though a work-study program.
Planning for the relay began last April in the Office of Student Affairs’ kitchen.
“We came up with this crazy idea that maybe we would do this team-builder and we would run a RagnarRelay,” case manager for the Office of Student Affairs and Hoya Reycers team captain Katie Boin said.
But Boin said she wanted the activity to be more than a bonding experience.
“We knew that we should have a cause — that we should do it for something bigger than ourselves,” Boin said. “Once we thought about the Cristo Rey piece, it was clear that that was what would get people really connected to the idea.”
Georgetown has developed a close partnership with Don Bosco since its founding in 2007, providing corporate work-study opportunities and offering orientation and training programs for Don Bosco students.
“We have a very close relationship with Georgetown. They have been wonderful from the very beginning,” Don Bosco’s Director of Development Claire Wyrsch said. “They have been terrific in inviting our students to summer programs, to days during the year to get a taste of the college experience. We have had students from Georgetown come over and tutor [our] students.”
The money raised from the weekend’s Ragnar Relay will help fund the school’s academic programs, Wyrsch said.
Before the relay, Hoya Reycer teammates had varying amounts of running experience. Some members, like Sonia Jacobson, an assistant for academic affairs, were running veterans, while others were racing for the first time.
“This is my first race ever in life,” Executive Director of Georgetown’s Meyers Institute for College Preparation Charlene Brown-McKenzie said.
The Reycers followed a traditional half- and full marathon training regime that included distance runs to build endurance. The race consisted of 36 legs of varying distances and difficulty levels. Each member of the team ran three legs, and the team finished in 34 hours.
But despite the preparation, the race format still brought unique challenges, such as the travel time, distance and nighttime portion, according to Boin.
“The challenge of this is not so much doing a five-mile run, which is not that challenging, but [rather] getting in a van, driving around for eight to 12 hours and then doing it again. And then getting in a van, driving around for eight to 12 hours and doing it again,” Assistant Vice President for Student Health James Welsh said.
