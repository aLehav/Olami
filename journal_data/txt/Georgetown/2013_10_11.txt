When Dani Bembry (COL ’15) returns to her dorm in Kennedy Hall, sometimes class is just getting started. Bembry is one of 11 students in “College, Culture and Conflict,” a new seminar that houses students together in the Hill River City Living and Learning Community.
“It seemed like a different and quirky new idea to have a living and learning component to the class. I just thought off the bat it seemed really interesting,” Bembry said.
LLC resident Neve Schadler (COL ’15) said that living with her classmates enhances her academic experience.
“It’s about the education experience — not just the academic life but the residential life of living with other people and growing with them,” Schadler said. “There’s a level of trust and familiarity that makes the academic experience so incredible.”
Taught by College Associate Dean Tad Howard, a faculty-in-residence for Kennedy Hall, the seminar looks at the history of conflict and possible solutions for college education in America.
The LLC was dubbed Hill River City after Fr. Tim Healy, S.J.,’s seminal talk, “The Hill, The River, The City: Meditations on a Bicentennial,” which addressed Georgetown’s identity as a D.C. institution as well as a university.
“It’s a beautiful reflection on where Georgetown had come from, what had changed, what had remained constant and what lies ahead,” Howard said.
As a faculty-in-residence for Kennedy Hall for the past seven years, Howard has enjoyed the unique connection that he has with the university and the students.
Howard, who has taught the class for the past four years, saw a living learning community as the perfect opportunity to bridge the lessons and history of the University with academic life in an organic way.
Cross-listed with American Studies and Humanities and Writing II, the course has drawn a diverse cross-section of students, including several first-year and transfer students.
“There are a lot of transfers in the class and they’re able to talk about their college experience before Georgetown and compare it to now. I think that adds a really unique dimension to the class,” Bembry said.
To keep the class lively, Howard holds the seminar in a variety of settings based on lecture content. For a recent lecture on the history of the sciences at Georgetown, students went to class at the Heyden Observatory.
“We went up there and we had been talking about the relationship between science and education. We were able to see Georgetown’s history with that,” Schadler said.
Students also meet weekly for breakfast in Howard’s living room where they discuss topics unrelated to class.
“Our hour-long breakfast allows us to explore campus and do unconventional things,” Bembry said. “We did an activity where we talked about ‘What’s music?’ and just engaged in a debate about relativity in the curriculum.”
Although the four-credit class will last only one semester, there is a single credit course in the spring for students to compare what they learned in “College, Culture and Conflict” with one of their spring courses.
“I want them to talk interdisciplinarily and make it painfully smashed together,” Howard said.

Love Saxa has brought speakers to campus to discuss traditional marriage and faith since spring 2012. But this year, the group has drawn criticism from GU Pride, whose members allege that the Love Saxa’s invitations have increasingly been extended to more homophobic guests.
“Last year, being on the board, I don’t remember them bringing anyone anti-gay to campus,” GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) said. “It seems like their programming has taken a turn for the more homophobic.”
Heritage Foundation fellow Ryan Anderson, who wrote a book opposing same-sex marriage, spoke Tuesday, and Mark Regnerus, who authored a study criticizing same-sex parenting, came to campus last Thursday. Members of the gay community protested Regnerus’ talk in silence, which was unrelated to his aforementioned research. Tuesday, members of GU Pride wore Pride T-shirts to demonstrate the presence of Georgetown’s LGBTQ community at Anderson’s event.
Love Saxa member Patrick Boyden (COL ’14) said that Love Saxa’s recent events are consistent with its mission.
“Our focus is combatting the hook-up culture,” Boyden said. “We think college students know there’s something beyond this pervasive sex culture. We think combatting the hook-up culture is looking towards marriage and family.”
Craig Cassey (COL ’15), an openly gay member of the Advisory Neighborhood Committee, first brought the Anderson event to Pride’s attention after last week’s protest, which was not directly affiliated with GU Pride.
“We see a conflict there. We figured it is important to have our community represented at these events,” Cassey said. “Both speakers have been viewed as homophobic. It seems evident that Love Saxa doesn’t agree with our belief of marriage equality being essential for America.”
GU Pride members also raised questions about the timing of these events during Coming Out Week and OUTober.
“I was surprised they would plan an event on marriage during the week Pride celebrates the LBGTQ identity,” Lloyd said. “That necessitated a formal response. I can’t speak to whether they’re doing it deliberately, but I think it’s poor planning — OUTober has been an established event before this was conceived.”
Love Saxa member Emile Doak (COL ’14) said that Tuesday happened to be the only time Anderson was available and the date was unrelated to OUTober.
“The fact that they’re close together was not our plan,” Doak said. “I actually feel bad about [the timing].”
During his lecture, Anderson discussed his rationale for opposing gay marriage.
“There are people on both sides of the debate who haven’t considered the other side,” Anderson said. “The argument I make about marriage isn’t based on religion or theology. It doesn’t discuss morality, and it doesn’t discuss gay marriage or homosexuality.”
Anderson said that marriage should not be “redefined” because it is a fundamental social institution.
“The love-making act is the life-giving act,” he said. “The marital relationship has an intrinsic connection to the creating and raising of new human beings.”
The presentation was followed by a spirited but courteous question-and-answer session during which Anderson debated with GU Pride members. Lloyd was among those who challenged Anderson’s logic.
“A queer person could remain celibate until marriage, then engage in a conjugal act that’s going to produce as many children as an infertile couple,” Lloyd said. “That act unites them because they’re the only people who are engaging in that act together, and then that makes them more committed to each other, more emotionally connected to each other, making them better parents, more able to raise their children in an effective way.”
“Conjugal union is by definition something only a man and a woman can participate in,” Anderson said in response.
Boyden said speakers like these were foundational to create a more open discussion on campus.
“Love Saxa is definitely a proponent of a traditional vision of love, the view of one man and one woman. We hold that out proudly. Talks like this can be the starting point for a conversation about the subject,” Boyden said.
Cassey and Lloyd were both optimistic about the attention the events drew to Pride and LGBTQ issues.
“It’s certainly energizing queer students and allies alike,” Cassey said. “Pride isn’t opposed to taking a part and being present at these events.”
Despite calling the events homophobic, Lloyd said he appreciated the dialogue that rose from them.
“In a way, I’m glad these students are bringing them to campus,” Lloyd said. “When people hold events like these that involve openly hostile speakers … it gives us the opportunity to engage people who wouldn’t normally be engaged by us.”
Director of Adult Faith Formation Ennio Mastroianni addressed GU Pride’s presence at the end of the event.
“I think that we can all agree that Ryan [Anderson] made us think, and thinking is good,” he said. “I want to congratulate the maturity level at which this discussion took place on everyone’s part.”

Deborah Tannen, a professor in the department of linguistics at Georgetown, analyzed the multifaceted nature of American Jewish speech on Wednesday evening in theBioethics Research Library.
“Don’t Just Sit There. Interrupt!: A Linguistic Analysis of New York Jewish Conversation” kicked off the Program for Jewish Civilization’s 2013-2014 lecture series.
While Tannen has recorded many of her conversations over the years, she honed in on one particular conversation at a Thanksgiving dinner table as the catalyst for her work.
“My goal was to simply describe each individual’s conversation style and the effect that it had on the interaction. Somehow I ended up writing about New York Jewish conversational style,” Tannen said.
Tannen played audio clips of the Thanksgiving dinner for audience members, explaining that New York Jewish conversational style could be described as a “high involvement style,” characterized by interruption and short pauses between speakers. Tannen noted that each person took different length pauses in conversation, which can lead to frustration and make communication difficult.
“How do we decide, as adults in conversation, when the other person is done and when to begin?” Tannen asked. “Any time there is a slight difference in the amount of pause that’s expected … the person that’s waiting to speak is getting frustrated.”
Tannen also addressed the interrogative nature of the New York Jewish style, where speakers often ask questions in order to express interest in the person speaking.
“Not everybody shares that style, so if you get people … where one thinks asking questions is a show of interest and the other thinks asking questions is intrusive … then you get mutual accusations,” she said.
Tannen also played a conversation among three Jewish New Yorkers and a woman from California to demonstrate how people who do not utilize similar conversational styles often find it hard to join the conversation of those who do. In her example, the New Yorkers were unsure of the name of a building and, while the Californian woman knew the information, she could not interrupt and share her information because she was not used to the style of conversation.
“If you share a sense of rhythm, and a sense of when it’s OK to talk along or not, you can take part in a conversation whether or not you know anything about what’s being said,” Tannen said. “If you don’t share conversational style, you cannot participate in the conversation, even if you do know.”
Paige Arthur (GRD ’15), who is studying linguistics, enjoyed Tannen’s lecture .
“I’m a huge fan of Deborah Tannen,” Arthur said. “I really enjoyed her lecturing style. She was so funny, and I really enjoyed hearing the laughter from the audience.”
While Arthur is not Jewish, she said she enjoyed the lecture precisely because of it was about something unfamiliar to her.
“It’s always pretty fascinating for me to go to some kind of gathering where there’s a certain group that’s gathering,” she said. “It’s kind of neat to be the outsider and observing those interactions.”

National demand for full-time MBA programs has begun to show signs of recovery for the first time since the beginning of the economic recession in 2009, while part-time programs are still losing popularity, a business school admissions survey announced last week.
Georgetown’s applicant pool for the part-time MBA program increased last year while the full-time applicant pool remained steady, leading to an overall increase in demand.
“I think, fairly obviously, perceptions of an improving economy have led people to be more willing to invest in their educations again,” Senior Associate Dean for MBA Programs Elaine Romanelli said. “With applications down across many schools, that suggests there is also some pent-up demand, that people that did not apply to business school or did not decide to make that investment during the recession are now back in the market, so it’s kind of a two-fold influence on an increase in applications.”
Full-time student Charles Shackelford (GRD ’15) agreed, although he said the economy was not the only factor in his decision to apply to the MBA program.
“My prior company was having difficulty winning as much work as usual, but I never felt worried for my job,” Shackelford said. “It’s more that I wanted to go in a different direction, so that’s the main reason I decided to come here.”
In spite of this apparent correlation between an improved economy and a rise in demand for MBA programs nationally, many students do not feel as if they directly considered the economy in their decisions to attend business school.
“You never know if there is a good time for overall economy. Just pick a good time for yourself, rather than looking around,” full-time student Fiona Ou (GRD ’15) said.
The increase in demand for MBA programs has directly increased the competition for acceptance to business school and jobs. For example, the average GMAT score for Georgetown’s full-time program in the last admissions cycle increased by five points from the previous year.
“This will mean more competition for applicants, which is a good thing for our program, as it means we will hopefully see stronger and more competitive applicants,” Associate Dean of MBA Admissions Shari Hubert said. “It also means that we’ll see more demand for our students from employers.”
Full-time student Miguel Cuunjieng (GRD ’15) agreed and said the added competition was visible, particularly among peers.
“It’s a little bit unnerving, and I can feel some of the effects here — it’s very high pressure and everybody is kind of clamoring around for internships and then full-time positions too,” Cuunjieng said. “It does add stress.”
Increased competition aside, Shackelford added that the increased demand for MBA programs could serve as a positive indicator of a recovering job market.
“I think it’s probably made it harder to get into school, but I think that because the job market is recovering, it’s a much better time to get a job now than it was four years ago or even two years ago,”Shackelford said. “I think, overall, the picture is looking better.”

Due to questions about the accuracy of aptitude tests such as the SAT and the ACT, some universities are seeking other ways of evaluating applicants’ abilities.
Starting this fall, Bard College is giving high school seniors a way to redeem poor grades and worse test scores through writing four 2,500-word research papers. If professors at the university give the papers at least a B-plus grade, students can be accepted.
“It’s kind of declaring war on the whole rigmarole of college admissions and the failure to foreground the curriculum and learning,” Bard President Leon Botstein told The New York Times. “You ask the young person: Are they prepared to do university-level work?”
In particular, Botstein expressed doubt about whether tests or grades can accurately reflect a student’s potential. Rather, they often reflect a student’s ability to successfully self-market. Bard spokesman Mark Primoff did not respond to other requests for comment.
Georgetown Dean of Admissions Charles Deacon, however, disagreed with Botstein’s premise and said that the university has no plans to adopt any similar initiatives.
“We’ve tried to use admissions ratings or counselor ratings, but it’s not quantifiable to predict results,” Deacon said. “It can also be utilized as justification for admitting athletes or students with legacies without having them to report their scores.”
Deacon also questioned whether Bard has ulterior motives, since eliminating SAT/ACT requirements could potentially increase applicant numbers and project higher selectivity, despite the amount of work involved with writing research papers.
Bard’s new application standards, however, were implemented after the National Association for College Admission Counseling encouraged universities to eliminate standardized testing from their admissions requirements in 2008, particularly because of an alleged bias toward affluent students.
According to College Board’s 2012-2013 testing report, students from families earning less than $20,000 annually averaged a score of 1326, while those from families earning more than $100,000 averaged 1619.
“A lot of the college application process is about if students have been trained to test well, and if they have been trained to write well,” said Kristin Collins, D.C. regional director for Strive for College Collaborative, a group that prepares low-income students for the SAT and the college application process. “If you are talking about low-income students, they have not been set up to succeed in the way that other students have.”
Regardless of financial situations, the College Board also reported that for the last five years, 57 percent of high school seniors have not hit the benchmark score of 1550 that allegedly deems whether a student is prepared for college. According to the College Board, this correlates with a 65 percent probability of earning at least a B-minus average as a freshman in college. Students who receive at least a 1550 are more likely to enroll in and complete a four-year college degree program.
In Washington, D.C., students have historically tested well below the national average. In the last five years, the average score for D.C. students has consistently been among the bottom two averages nationwide. Although D.C. students showed small signs of improvement in the last testing cycle, the average score of 1200 was still below the national average of 1400.
In addition to the socioeconomic factors at play, several experts have alleged that both college admissions and standardized tests do not accurately judge a student’s ability; rather, they seem to emphasize achievements.
For example, College Board President David Coleman has suggested that the Common Application to replace the personal statement with an analytical essay.
“If an essential requirement of success is to make an argument and write analytically, then why wouldn’t the admissions essay ask for that?” Coleman said to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Deacon also emphasized the drawbacks of the Common App, pointing to Georgetown’s continued reliance on its own application system.
“We know scores paint only a small picture of the student,” Deacon said. “That’s why we want to get to know students better through our personal Georgetown essays and interviews. We want students to directly communicate to us and not through a one-size-fits-all essay for the Common App.”
The College Board Communications Office declined to comment beyond its publically available press releases and reports.

Former lobbyist and convicted felon Jack Abramoff (LAW ’86) reflected on his past corruption on Capitol Hill and offered solutions for reforming campaign finance legislation in Lohrfink Auditorium on Wednesday.
In the hour-long Georgetown University Lecture Fund event, “Can Washington Be Fixed? The Ultimate Insider Shows Us Why the System’s Broken and How to Reform It,” Abramoff looked back on the years he spent lobbying members of Congress.
Through the provision of improper benefits, Abramoff was able to operate effectively by gaining access to members of the House of Representatives and Senate, whom he persuaded to support his clientele’s position.
“I spent $1.5 million a year on sports tickets alone in order to get policymakers to come with me so that I would have an opportunity to influence them and have them be indebted to me in some way,” Abramoff said.
Abramoff spoke about his peak lobbying years when he won multimillion dollar accounts to represent the interests of everyone from Native American casino owners to Russian energy companies in Washington, D.C.
“People come to this city for power, and I was clearly one of them. I was brash, a bit arrogant, but it was because I had more connections than just about anyone,” he said. “I figured that I wasn’t really doing anything wrong, because every lobbying firm on Capitol Hill was giving the same improper benefits. I was just doing it on a much larger scale.”
Abramoff was eventually indicted on felony corruption charges and was imprisoned from November 2006 to June 2010, a time that he said allowed him to realize the faults within himself and the system.
“I came to realize that it’s unfair when your firm has the resources to fly congressmen to St. Andrews for a round of golf while your opponent is getting their calls put on hold by those same congressmen,” Abramoff said. “I had created a system for myself whereupon I could buy a policymaker a dinner or take them to a game and would persuade them over to my side that very same night. Buying that access is corrupt, and it left people with a passion for a cause and a rightful case, but no money, with an impossible fight.”
The man whose black hat became synonymous with Washington corruption claims to have fully learned his lesson and is now trying to reform the same system that he once exploited. Abramoff has been working with United Republic, a political reform group that vociferously attacked him when the corruption allegations surfaced.
“I’m a conservative, but I want to work with people of all political affiliations to get certain anti-corruption and campaign finance legislation passed,” he said. “I want people who are lobbyists to have to register as lobbyists, and once they do so, they should be barred from contributing election campaign money. That is actual reform. However, to get this passed would require asking the congressmen who benefit from that money to reject it, which is difficult to do.”
Abramoff, who as of May 2012 owed $44 million in restitution for defrauding his Native American tribe clients, concluded his speech by offering some cautionary advice to the Georgetown students in the audience.
“For those of you headed to Capitol Hill in the future, just know that no matter what you do there, learn the rules and play by them, because shortcuts will come back to bite you,” Abramoff said. “Know all debts must eventually be repaid, and this is coming from a guy that only took shortcuts in his professional life.”
Students in attendance said they appreciated Abramoff’s advice.
“It was good to be made aware of this side of the political landscape. His Time magazine cover which read, ‘The Man Who Bought Washington’ turned out to be rather apt,” Yash Johri (SFS ’17) said. “It was really interesting to see how his experience in jail has reformed his political morals.”

The Culture and Politics program received approval to hire an additional tenure-line faculty member to focus solely on the CULP program early this semester.
Field Chair Shiloh Krupar is currently the only faculty member solely dedicated to CULP.
While many other professors teach CULP courses, the professors are all hired by other departments.
“Because it is an interdisciplinary major, CULP faculty members are from multiple departments and programs enabling the intellectual synergy among faculty and students,” School of Foreign Service Associate Dean and Director of the Undergraduate Program Mitch Kaneda wrote in an email. “However, it has been long recognized that there is a need for an additional CULP-dedicated faculty member to enhance the strength of the major.”
As the sole faculty member dedicated exclusively to CULP, Krupar did not find much company when she first began teaching in the basement of the ICC.
“I didn’t have a community of faculty right around me. Part of that was because there wasn’t any other Culture and Politics faculty member, and everyone involved had an office somewhere with their crossaffiliated program. Because I was in the basement, it just felt really isolating,” Krupar said.
For Krupar, an additional faculty member would not only solidify the major but aid in the advising process as well. CULP is the second-largest SFS major.
“This second line would generate more stability in terms of faculty being directly affiliated with the program,” Krupar said. “Everyone else is cross-affiliated so they have responsibilities in other places as well as Culture and Politics. A second person fully attached to the program would really help with advising.”
A search committee formed for the hiring process released an advertisement early this semester that emphasized the desire to hire a professor who specializes in visual culture and new media.
“A lot of students are interested in visual culture and new media, and so that is what we tried to respond to,” Krupar said. “I’m hoping this will help bring somebody and address those needs that students have articulated.”
The SFS hopes to bring three to five candidates to campus in early December to give guest lectures and interact with students.
Kaneda said that an additional professor would bring diversity to the program.
“[The] addition of a CULP-dedicated faculty member will strengthen the major by bringing stability to course offerings, enhancing the intellectual synergy among students and faculty, providing additional advising capacity for the students and supporting the mission of the SFS,” Kaneda wrote.
While the new faculty will benefit the major, Krupar stressed that the new hire would serve the entire SFS community.
“While I’ve emphasized mostly that this new hire would provide more stability for CULP, that’s not to the exclusion of this person not collaborating with other programs in the SFS and other departments in the SFS,” Krupar said.
The additional faculty member, however, does not represent a long-term expansion of the major.
“I am not aware of any long-term plans to build a more CULP-specific faculty at this time,” Krupar wrote in an email. “The new faculty line should not necessarily be seen as an expansion of the program; rather, its main purpose is to stabilize and secure the program as it currently exists, in terms of course offerings, advising needs, etc.”

In the midst of the federal government shutdown, immigration reform activists continued to rally behind their cause Tuesday during a protest on the National Mall, where approximately 200 participants were arrested.
Among those arrested were eight Democratic members of the House of Representatives and Gustavo Torres, executive director of CASA de Maryland, a group that supports Latino immigrants and advocates for reform. U.S. Capitol Police officers stationed in front of the Capitol arrested those who would not clear out of the way when asked, The Washington Post reported.
The rally was organized by the Center for Community Change and the Service Employees International Union to call the House of Representatives to action on immigration reform. As some in the crowd of 10,000 chanted “Si se puede!” (Yes we can!), others shouted, “Congress, remember, we’re voting in November!”
After months of delaying, House Democrats introduced several pieces of immigration reform legislation on Oct. 2 that were largely based on a Senate bill passed in June. The Senate bill would revamp the immigration system and allow undocumented immigrants to apply for U.S. citizenship within 13 years. The House, however, has segmented the legislation into separate bills that each addresses smaller issues.
CASA de Maryland representative Lydia Walther Rodriguez, who participated in the rally, said that she was confident in the movement’s power.
“Congress is still inside, so they’re still working. They still need to know that we’re here and there’s a lot of us,” Rodriguez said. “Make a decision now. Don’t wait any longer.”
Georgetown Assistant Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming, however, said that the government shutdown has drawn the nation’s attention away from immigration reform.
“The debt ceiling is also such a major impact on the United States as well as the world economy that that is the 800-lb. gorilla in the room, if you will, that has got to be dealt with,” Fleming said. “It remains my hope that once we get beyond the hope that once we get beyond the current government shutdown and beyond the impending subject of the debt ceiling, there will be a refocused attention on immigration reform.”
Fleming said that two particular provisions of the immigration bill, the DREAM Act and the H1B Visa provisions, would directly affect students.
“I know a good number of the Dreamers on our campus,” Fleming said. “They are amazing individuals. They have overcome incredible odds to get to where they are.”
Tuesday’s rally represented a unification of immigration reform allies and those who would be affected by the new immigration laws. Protester Nelson Mendoza, who is originally from El Salvador, emphasized the importance of presenting a united front.
“We have to support them even if we are legal. We have to give them a hand to ask Congress to pass the law,” Mendoza said. “They are not criminals. … They are just coming to work and do the best that they can to support their family here and their family in their countries.”
Protester Alisa Leucero is a Dreamer who was granted amnesty under the Obama administration’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and graduated from a New York high school this June.
“We want them to remember that we are here and to not forget that we want reform,” Leucero said. “Sometimes, it seems like they are putting Obamacare and Syria and things like that first but forgetting about us.”
Many Catholic organizations, including Georgetown, have supported the cause of immigration reform. University President John J. DeGioia signed a letter to Congress this summer along with presidents of other Catholic universities pushing for immigration reform. DeGioia also previously made a number of personal phone calls to several members of Congress, encouraging senators to vote for the DREAM Act.
“It goes to our mission and our sense of social justice that is inherent here at Georgetown and at other Catholic colleges and universities,” Fleming said.
In support of this movement, Fleming’s office has compiled a video interview project, highlighting the stories of students at Georgetown who have been affected by the DREAM Act. The final interview was completed Monday, and the videos will be posted on the Office of Federal Relations’ Web page in the near future.
“If a member of Congress sees a real face on a story, it turns it from statistics into people,” Fleming said. “It is my feeling that when members of Congress — who either are undecided or opposed to the DREAM Act — see these stories, it will make them think again.”

The Office of the Registrar began to roll out of a number of largely visual changes to MyAccess last weekend ahead of an expected larger overhaul to the system.
These changes included collapsible menus and a feature that allows students to easily browse back through previous pages. The website now features a modernized layout, replete with a new color scheme, sparser text, larger menu buttons and more readable page descriptions.
“For many students and faculty, the look and feel of MyAccess has been a little drab,” Student Systems Director Patrick Versace said. “It will probably be about a year before we see the complete update.”
Versace said that he hopes to completely implement the changes by next fall, but the timing is not yet determined.
Georgetown MyAccess is a localized version of the Banner student software from Ellucian Systems, which the university adopted in 2009. Banner is used by many colleges and universities to manage student and faculty accounts.
“Each university can localize that part of the product to some extent, so our localization of the self-service component of Banner is what we call MyAccess,” University Registrar John Q. Pierce said.
The software is updated yearly by the company that owns it. Most updates regard compliance with federal financial aid regulations, as well as minor system updates. This year, however, Banner will receive more substantive updates from Ellucian.
“The adjustments that have been made are not changes that have been designed at Georgetown, but rather we’re implementing new code that has been released by the company,” Pierce said.
One major feature that may be introduced within the next year features increased integration with Degree Works, a degree audit page that allows students to view what requirements they have left to fulfill.
“You might start in Degree Works and be able to find what you want to take, click through and it will register you there.” Pierce said.
The course registration process may soon change as well.
“There are a number of changes being discussed internally, including changing to a real-time registration system,” Versace said.
However, the university is exercising caution before introducing any major changes.
“We’ll be reaching out to the student tech committee to form test groups for the new features.” Versace said. “We think that as students and faculty see the updates, they will real-ly like what they see.”
Many of Banner’s updated features are for the administrative side of the program and will not be seen by students.
“It’s still in development, but one of the features we are hoping to roll out in time for grading in December is nothing that the students that will notice, but it provides the ability for faculty to extract a spreadsheet from Blackboard for example and upload the grades directly into Banner,” Pierce said. “We tested it this spring, and people said that their time spent entering grades went from an hour to 10 minutes.”
Last year, the Office of the Registrar, in conjunction with Students of Georgetown Inc., introduced Classy, a service that allows students to search for classes on an outside site and more easily visualize potential schedules. The registrar’s office plans to support any updates and increased use of this service, although no specific plans are currently in place.
“One of the problems was that students were thinking they were registering for a course that turned out to have had a schedule change in Banner,” Pierce said. “My interpretation is that students found it useful, so I would like to continue to support it.”
Corp Marketing Director Emily Coch (COL ’15) said that the service will continue.
“We’re continuing to develop the features of Classy to better meet the needs of all students,” Coch said. “We’re collaborating with the university on increased integration. … When December comes around, you’ll see it again, hopefully with some updates.”

When Anupam Chakravarty (SFS ’10) arrived at Georgetown in fall 2006, he planned to spend only the next four years on campus.
Seven years later, he’s still here.
“There’s this energy in the city and energy on campus,” said Chakravarty, now senior manager for interactive communications and multimedia strategy in the Office of Advancement.
After graduation, Chakravarty took a few months off, but eventually returned to help a professor. Talking to different professors compelled him to return permanently.
Amanda Delp (SFS ’12) began working for the Office of the Provost the Monday after graduation. The position started out in the summer as a temporary favor to the office — which she had worked for as an undergraduate — but eventually developed into a full-time job that fall.
“It was odd when students came back that first fall and I wasn’t joining them,” Delp said.
Michael Renzi’s (COL ’12) work in web services and project management for University Information Services also evolved from a student position.
“[It is] definitely a good bridge from the academic to the professional world,” Renzi said.
Although staying at Georgetown can help ease alumni into the transition from student to working professional, it also blurs the lines between student and staffer. Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), administrator for the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor, recently worked with her former roommate, currently a senior at Georgetown, on an Alternative Spring Break project.
“I work very closely with her in a professional capacity, but she’s also seen my dirty socks,” she said.
Theon O’Connor (COL ’12), who works for the Office of Neighborhood Life, said that student interaction is one of the primary reasons he loves his job here.
“I knew I needed a job that would give me that connection with students on a day-to-day basis, and I think I’ve gotten that with what I’ve done here,” he said.
One of the major perks for Georgetown staff is the university’s Tuition Assistance Program. After working at Georgetown for a full year, full-time employees can attend a Georgetown master’s program, including law school or the MBA program, free of charge.
To participate, the staff member must continue to work full-time in addition to nighttime graduate school courses. Renzi intends to begin working toward a master’s degree in economics next fall.
“It’s going to be crazy. I’m not going to have a lot of free time, but it’s really too good a deal for me to pass up,” he said.
Even though they may be busy taking courses on top of a full-time job, employees who take up coursework said they find support from their employers.
“Most people who work at Georgetown, like bosses and supervisors, they understand and encourage and look favorably toward their employees doing grad school here,” Chakravarty, who is currently pursuing a master’s degree in Communication, Culture and Technology, said.
To work while being surrounded by students can also trigger nostalgia for these recent grads.
“I definitely get a little sad watching all the students walking around,” Renzi said.
Chakravarty agreed.
“Every time I walk through campus and the smell of GUGS burgers and the passionate look of people in Red Square, or even these goofballs talking about what they did on Saturday while making coffee, that part I definitely miss,” Chakravarty said.
Delp, however, prefers the life of a staffer.
“I appreciate not having to go to class and not having to have my life revolve around midterms. It’s the nice parts of student life without having to do those parts,” she said.
Chakravarty said that he initially had reservations about working at Georgetown after college.
“You don’t want to be that guy in the varsity jacket in the senior parking lot of your old high school,” he said. “There’s this expectation that everyone is going to make their impact way beyond the Hilltop, so I had some trepidation about coming back.”
Jesslyn Cheong (SFS ’11), who works at the Kalmanovitz Initiative with Kohnert-Yount, added that she was originally concerned that by staying at Georgetown, she wasn’t pushing her boundaries enough.
“It eased the transition, but I didn’t want to be too comfortable either, because it kind of felt like making a safe choice, but I think it really was the right choice in the end, because even though it was a place I feel comfortable at, it really allowed me to see a whole different perspective of Georgetown,” she said.
Chakravarty hopes to eventually start his own nonprofit, and thus sees his work at Georgetown as a means to achieving this.
“Now the possibilities seem a lot more endless than they did, you know, in 2010 when I graduated. Now, I feel like I’ve learned a lot about a lot of different fields,” he said.
After two months as a Georgetown employee, Kohnert-Yount said that she is glad she returned to campus.
“I wanted to do something at this point in my life that was very closely tied to social justice and community work,” Kohnert-Yount said. “I actually think this might be the best job I ever have.”

Georgetown officially launched the McCourt School of Public Policy this week and honored Frank McCourt Jr. (CAS ’75) for his record-breaking $100 million gift.
“[The school is] everything about Georgetown,” McCourt, whose son, father and two brothers attended the university, told The Hoya. “I grew up living and breathing public policy at the dinner table.”
To celebrate, the university sponsored several events on campus throughout the week, including a campus-wide barbecue, reception and academic ceremony Tuesday and a panel on public policy and dinner Wednesday. The Office of Advancement purchased advertisements in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Boston Globe, The Financial Times and Politico.
“They were a way to both thank Mr. McCourt and continue to educate the policy community about the founding of the McCourt School,” university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, who declined to disclose the cost of the advertisements, wrote in an email.
The Tuesday ceremony in Dahlgren Quad featured speeches by McCourt, University President John J. DeGioia, Dean of the College Chester Gillis, Provost Robert Groves and McCourt School Dean Edward Montgomery.
“My father arrived at Georgetown in 1935 and lived right up there,” McCourt said during his speech, pointing to Healy Hall. “That marked the beginning of an 80-year love affair between the McCourt family and Georgetown University.”
The university officials praised McCourt for his generous donation and emphasized that the new school embodies the core of a Georgetown education: genuine dialogue, engagement and Jesuit values.
“This pattern of engagement, this commitment to genuine dialogue, to the idea that we arrive closer to the truth when we pursue the best in one another has never been more needed,” DeGioia said. “This is a moment that demands the very best of us — the generosity that we honor today places a new burden of responsibility on the university.”
Groves emphasized the importance of the McCourt School as the first major public policy institute to be formed after the multimedia and Internet data revolution.
“Government programs now run on vast data systems,” Groves said. “The evolution of the Internet is generating real time data on human behavior at an unprecedented rate.”
McCourt added that the new school would play a particularly vital role during a precarious time for the nation’s government, with the most polarized Congress in recent memory.
“I’m sure the irony is not lost to anyone here that our government is shut down on the day this school is being established,” McCourt said.
Following Tuesday’s official kickoff, the university convened a panel in Riggs Library on Wednesday that featured faculty members of the new school, including Montgomery, government professor and Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne, Vice-Provost for Faculty Adriana Kugler and former Georgetown Public Policy Institute professor James Habyarimana. During the panel, the professors highlighted issues that would be studied at the new school, particularly immigration, health reform, education reform and global poverty, as well as the importance of inter-disciplinary cooperation.
The university closed its celebratory exercises with a reception and dinner on Copley Lawn on Wednesday that featured speeches from PBS NewsHour Co-Anchor and Managing Editor Judy Woodruff, Sen. Patrick Leahy (LAW ’64) (D-Vt.), Rep. John Dingell (C ’49, LAW ’52) (D-Mich.), Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), Board of Directors Chairman Paul Tagliabue (CAS ’62), in addition to McCourt and DeGioia. Several noteworthy guests were also in attendance, including House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and former NBA player Alonzo Mourning (CAS ’92). A pre-recorded video message from former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) played during the dinner.
“You have given a gift not just to Georgetown,” Leahy said. “You have given a gift to the future.”
Markey agreed and expressed high hopes for the school’s future, praising McCourt’s foresight and vision.
“This was a contemplative in the middle of the action, and this school that will bear his name is going to put students in the middle of the action in the most powerful city in the world,” Markey said.
Several of the Congress members in attendance stressed the relevance of the school, particularly in light of the current federal government shutdown.
“Let us pray that some members of Congress will come and study here,” Leahy said jokingly.
Dingell, the longest-serving member in the history of Congress, who attended Georgetown when there were only 100 students and tuition was $600 a semester, agreed.
“All you have to do is to look and see the unfortunate low charades that are going on in the House of Representatives now to appreciate how desperately the values that are taught here at Georgetown are needed in our government,” Dingell said.
McCourt expressed hope that the new school would live up to the motto currently inscribed in Gaston Hall: “For the greater glory of God and the betterment of mankind.”
“This is a time for optimism,” McCourt said. “A new school for the common good has been born.”
DeGioia expressed gratitude and encouraged the university to embrace the responsibility that comes along with McCourt’s gift.
“This trust Frank has placed in us provides us a new opportunity to do our very best work and bring out the very best in everyone around us,” DeGioia said. “We will do our best to prove ourselves worthy of this trust.”
