Georgetown University’s Hotel and Conference Center has become crowded with students needing to quarantine after the campus community experienced a spike in positive COVID-19 cases.
After 35 community members tested positive for COVID-19 between Oct. 26 and 28, Georgetown mandated all students be tested. During the week of Oct. 24, the university reported 69 positive COVID-19 cases. The rise in COVID-19 cases has prompted student questions over what the quarantine and isolation process looks like on campus, what the university requires of students who have tested positive and what other students have experienced while isolating. Get the answers to the most common questions below:
What happens when a student tests positive for COVID-19?
When a student receives a positive COVID-19 test, they will receive a call from Georgetown University notifying them of their test results. The GU Care Navigator Team will also send a message to the student with a timeline for their isolation. 
Students who test positive will be required to isolate for 10 days, starting either the day they tested positive or when they first noticed COVID-19 symptoms, according to a message sent by the COVID-19 Care Navigator Team obtained by The Hoya.
“People who have tested positive or are sick with COVID-19 should self-isolate for at least 10 days, starting either the day they took the positive test (if they remain asymptomatic), or the day their symptoms started,” the message reads.
If students cannot isolate in their on-campus or off-campus housing, they will be transferred to the hotel by university staff within a few hours.
What is the process for students quarantining on campus?
Once a student arrives at the hotel, they are given a one-time access key to their room, where they isolate for the following 10 days, according to the university’s Quarantine & Isolation webpage.
Around 9 a.m. each day, the university drops off food for the entire day in front of each student’s door, including breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. The meals are mostly microwavable, and students are able to request additional food items if necessary, including coffee, granola bars, desserts and juices. A minifridge filled with water and some nonperishable drinks and snacks is also provided in each room.
Each day, students in isolation must fill out a survey provided by the university to record their symptoms. At the end of the 10 days in isolation, or 10 days after the date of the positive test, students are released from quarantine and may return to campus. 
Can students get retested once they are in quarantine to account for false positive test results?
Georgetown University, along with the CDC and the Washington, D.C. Department of Health, mandates that anyone who has a positive PCR test must complete 10 days of isolation, regardless of the result of any COVID-19 test they receive after. 
“Receiving different PCR test results on consecutive days can happen for different reasons and usually has to do with where you are in the infection cycle,” the university’s COVID-19 FAQs webpage reads. “PCR tests’ accuracy often depends on when someone is tested––early in the infection cycle or later in the infection cycle, the viral particles may be lower or even undetected.” 
Can students quarantine elsewhere?
The university suggests that if students are able to do so, they should isolate in their own dormitory or off-campus residence to ensure there are enough hotel rooms open for future positive tests. However, if this is not possible, the university will provide students a hotel room to isolate.
University staff will provide food and other essential items for students isolating in their on-campus residence; however, staff will be unable to bring food to students isolating off-campus.

Washington, D.C. officials launched a rewriting project of the District’s 120-year-old criminal code in consultation with Georgetown University Law Center professors. 
The Council of the District of Columbia is conducting a series of public hearings to discuss modernizing the city’s criminal statutes by redefining certain crimes, clarifying definitions and changing conviction consequences. As part of the process, Georgetown Law professors have testified and offered their expertise on the justice system. 
The D.C. Criminal Code Revision Commission (CCRC) started the process of revising the code in 2016, and in October 2021 the CCRC submitted a 329-page bill of proposed changes to the council.
The first public hearing occurred Nov. 4. Several Georgetown Law professors testified at the first hearing, including Eduardo Ferrer (MSB ’02, LAW ’05), policy director of the Georgetown Juvenile Justice Initiative, Vida Johnson, a professor of criminal law and procedure, and Tyrone Walker, director of reentry services for the Georgetown Prisons and Justice Initiative. In addition to the hearings, the council encourages D.C. residents to provide written testimony on the proposal.
The revision will have an incredibly broad impact on all levels of the criminal justice system, according to Ferrer, who advised the CCRC on criminal and juvenile legal systems, his area of expertise.
“The criminal code revision is about more than just who is currently incarcerated, but also whether and how things should be tried in the first place,” Ferrer said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It is broader than just incarceration — it affects things like sentencing, resentencing, it is so comprehensive and a very important undertaking.”
D.C. has not updated its criminal code since 1901, when Congress originally codified the District’s statutes. In 2000, three Brooklyn Law School professors ranked D.C.’s criminal code as one of the worst in the country, based on its lack of clarity and consistency.
Many aspects of the current code are outdated remnants of past mentalities about crime, including mandatory minimums, which are predefined sentences for certain crimes, according to John Copacino, director of the Criminal Justice Clinic at Georgetown Law. 
“These mandatories were passed during the ‘war on crime’ when people thought what we need to do is put people in jail for longer times in order to remove them from the street in eras where we thought there were people who were superpredators,” Copacino said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “The D.C. Council has been moving away from that.” 
The removal of mandatory minimums for sentences gives judges greater discretion in sentencing and allows incarcerated people who have served more than 15 years to petition a judge for resentencing or early release.
Without mandatory minimums, judges will be able to evaluate each case holistically instead of being forced to give a particular sentence, according to Copacino.
“Judges don’t have the discretion now to go below them, and this takes away all mandatory minimums and places everything now in the judge’s decision, where it should be,” Copacino said. “It’s better that way that judges get to decide based on everything.”
The proposal to rewrite the code demonstrates the council’s dedication to critically evaluating the criminal justice system, according to Ferrer.
“It is the first time since the original writing of the code in 1901 that the District is actually taking a step back to look at its criminal statutes as a whole and asking the question, do these statues really make sense, are they clear and do they align with our values here in the District of Columbia,” Ferrer said. 
According to Copacino, the proposed changes to the code will allow incarcerated individuals opportunities for rehabilitation and reintegration.
“This law gives everyone a second chance,” Copacino said. “It’s an enlightened piece of legislation, it really is and I hope that it passes. We have a very enlightened city council right now.”

The Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Workers (GAGE) affirmed its support for student workers at Columbia University after over 3,000 Columbia undergraduate and graduate student workers launched a unionwide strike Nov. 3.
Members of the Student Workers of Columbia-United Auto Workers (SWC-UAW), Columbia’s student union composed of teaching assistants, research assistants and undergraduate student workers, launched the strike after the union failed to reach a contract agreement with Columbia University in Nov. 1 and Nov. 2 bargaining sessions.
SWC-UAW is specifically calling on Columbia to agree to a contract that includes increased pay to meet student living needs in New York City, a more robust dental and vision insurance plan, better protection for international students, reduction of pay disparity and a guarantee for neutral third-party arbitration in discrimination and harassment cases.
GAGE supports SWC-UAW as they seek a new contract agreement with Columbia University, according to GAGE Secretary Jeffrey Tsoi (LAW ’23, GRD ’26).
“We hope that the voice of graduate workers at Columbia and support from the public would prompt Columbia administration to recognize the importance of SWC’s demands as soon as possible and negotiate a fair and just contract with SWC,” Tsoi wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The student workers decided to strike after the university failed to respond to their demands, according to Charles Steinman, a history doctoral student at Columbia who serves as a picket captain and frontline strike organizer. 
“To make a long story short, a continued pattern of insult and intransigence by Columbia at the bargaining table, we realized we had no choice but to go on strike in order to get a strong, fair contract,” Steinman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am encouraged by the tangible joy in the face of hardship, as well as the ethic of care and love, that I’ve experienced at the picket thus far. Columbia wants to starve us out, to intimidate us. This will not work.”
This is SWC-UAW’s fourth strike in four years. The most recent strike occurred in spring 2021, when a proposed labor contract was drafted but voted down by the union for its failure to meet key demands, including a large enough pay raise. SWC-UAW created a new bargaining committee following this strike to better represent students. 
The new bargaining committee refuses to accept an unfair contract, which has led to a standstill in negotiations, according to Steinman. 
With the new bargaining agreement, the union is continuing negotiations and hopeful for an agreement, according to Roger Creel, a fourth-year graduate student at Columbia.
“Essentially, our goal is to come to a contract both that our unit accepts and Columbia is willing to sign,” Creel said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We are a large percentage of the way to a contract that I think the unit will buy into, but what remains are a few key issues, such as neutral third-party arbitration, dental and pay parity.”
While GAGE never formally launched a strike in response to standstills in contract negotiations, the union did launch protests in spring 2020 calling on Georgetown administrators to agree to a contract after over a year of negotiations. GAGE ultimately ratified its contract in May 2020, securing a 12% pay boost to graduate workers on nine-month contracts and a 15% boost to workers on 12-month contracts. 
As the strike continues, Tsoi said GAGE will remain in solidarity with Columbia’s union.
“We hope that the voice of graduate workers at Columbia and support from the public would prompt Columbia administration to recognize the importance of SWC’s demands as soon as possible and negotiate a fair and just contract with SWC,” Tsoi wrote. “We always stand in solidarity with graduate workers across the country fighting for fair and just contracts.” 
Columbia is committed to reaching an agreement with the union and hopes to end the strike as soon as possible, according to a Nov. 10 statement from Columbia Provost Mary Boyce. 
“I want to express my commitment to our community that the University will take every reasonable step to end the strike as soon as possible,” Boyce wrote in the statement. “The University’s willingness to reach an agreement is manifested in the series of generous proposals we have brought to the table that would measurably further improve the lives of our students.”
When reached for comment, a university spokesperson for Columbia directed The Hoya to the Nov. 10 statement.
While unclear when the Columbia student workers strike will end, solidarity from other schools is important to show universities across the country that student workers will advocate for themselves, according to Creel. 
“Solidarity from an organization like Georgetown’s Alliance of Student Employees is crucial for us in the strike,” Creel wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We need to demonstrate that students at each university are not isolated, but rather that we all fight for the same vision of just working conditions.”

The student body elected 11 new senators to the Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate on Nov. 6, marking the first time the body will be completely filled since July.
Twenty-one first-year students ran for seven available seats, while four sophomores ran uncontested for four at-large seats. Polls for the fall 2021 senate elections first opened Nov. 4 and closed two days later on Nov. 6. 
The newly elected first-year senators include Chijioke Achebe (SFS ’25), Joshua Bernard-Pearl (SFS ’25), Phoebe Chambers (COL ’25), John DiPierri (SFS ’25), Alicia Gopal (COL ’25), Bayla Huff (COL ’25) and Sanji Ranganathan (SFS ’25). 
The four students elected to the at-large seats include Manahal Fazal (SFS ’24), Alyssa Hirai (SFS ’24), Johnny Sussek (COL ’24) and Spencer Woodall (MSB, SFS ’24).
The new senators will bring a fresh sense of energy and dedication to GUSA, according to GUSA Senate Speaker Leo Rassieur (COL ’22).
“It’s really great to get new perspectives on the ideas that we’ve been working on for so long,” Rassieur said in an interview with The Hoya. “I can tell based on their campaigns that they are bringing a lot of energy and that they care about the senate.”
Twenty-five students announced their campaigns for the GUSA Senate last week, with many focusing their platforms on improving student safety and expanding dining hours and options on campus. 
First-year Senator-elect Chambers said that GUSA should make increasing university communication around security events a top priority once the new class of senators is sworn in.
“I think one of the biggest things that I’m looking forward to is just changing the HOYAlert system,” Chambers said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think for the freshmen, particularly as a New South resident myself, that issue really hit close to home and I think that’s what drove a lot of voters out for people campaigning based on safety. And I think that’s definitely something with enough student push that we can accomplish.”
Other incoming senators, like Sussek, expressed a desire to address student dining needs on campus.
“Definitely addressing real changes, like writing referendums and talking to administration to get Leo’s open until 10 p.m. — that’s something I’m very passionate about; I think it’ll make all our lives much easier, much more flexible,” Sussek said in an interview with The Hoya.
Though first-year senate elections have typically been held in September, GUSA changed election cycles this past January to hold first-year and at-large senator elections in November, with elections for sophomore, junior and senior senators to occur in April. The changes were meant to give students more time to develop campaign platforms, as well as encourage more student participation, according to Rassieur.
The changes to the election timeline ultimately improved the fall 2021 election cycle, according to Rassieur.
“I really think it benefited the election and the candidates and everyone overall because it gave everyone a chance to acclimate to Georgetown first and to better understand what the issues are,” Rassieur said. “I think that’s reflected in the candidates, and what they campaigned on is much more issues-focused and relevant to what some of the more pressing, relevant topics are in the Georgetown community.”
Although GUSA hoped the change in timeline would increase student engagement in elections, it did not greatly affect this year’s voter turnout, with 20.11% of the student body voting in the fall 2021 elections compared to 19.2% in the last on-campus election in 2019. The number of candidates who ran for at-large seats also fell this year, as both the 2019 and 2020 fall elections saw five and six candidates run for the same number of seats, respectively. 
The 11 newly elected senators will be sworn in at the Nov. 14 GUSA meeting. Once sworn in, the new class of senators will hold internal elections to determine new senate leadership and assignments to senate policy committees and advisory boards, according to Rassieur.
The new group of senators will bring a new energy and drive to GUSA, according to Chambers.
“The group of seven freshman senators is a really passionate and fierce group,” Chambers said. “I’m excited to see what we bring to the table and the change we enact.”

Water services will be disconnected Dec. 1 for D.C. Water customers who fail to pay their bills or register for a financial assistance program. 
D.C. Water, a nonprofit water utility company servicing Washington, D.C., originally stopped disconnections and waived late fees in an effort to ensure residents could access their services during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, D.C. Water announced Nov. 2 that it would resume disconnections, as the current outstanding balances are hindering operations. 
D.C. Water is resuming disconnections out of necessity, as customers’ unpaid bills, which now total $26.3 million, threaten future operations, according to Pamela Mooring, external communications manager at D.C. Water. 
“We don’t want to disconnect anyone, but we need customers to pay their past due balances so that we can keep the water flowing,” Mooring wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Late fees and interest charges on outstanding balances resumed Sept. 1 in an effort to encourage customers to pay their bills or seek financial assistance. Still, the reinstatement of interest charges and late fees was not enough to incentivize customers to pay, according to Mooring. 
D.C. Water needs customers to pay their outstanding balances so it can continue to provide water for District residents, David Gadis, CEO and general manager of D.C. Water, wrote in a Nov. 2 press release. 
“We have a duty to continue delivering water and sewer services to the District. As a not-for-profit organization, we rely on revenue for operations and capital projects,” Gadis said in the press release. “With arrears this significant, it could jeopardize our ability to deliver these critical services.” 
Unpaid bills have prevented D.C. Water from making infrastructure improvements and taking on additional projects, according to Mooring. 
“We reduced expenditures — we delayed $170 million worth of capital projects and have over 100 vacancies that we need to fill for critical operations and to advance the infrastructure program,” Mooring wrote. “Currently, we are having to prioritize filling those vacancies because of the shortfall.”
D.C. Water has taken steps during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that financial circumstances do not bar anyone from having access to water. One such initiative, which launched Feb. 8 and continues to be an option, gives customers who live in multifamily buildings, such as apartment buildings or low-income condominium buildings, the opportunity to apply for financial assistance in paying their water bills. 
Customers who enroll in one of the nine different federal and local programs that offer millions of dollars in financial assistance will not be disconnected from water services, according to Mooring. 
“We have existing discounts for eligible customers that are ongoing and we have some emergency funding for those financially impacted by the pandemic,” Mooring wrote. “There is plenty of funding available.”
As the threat of disconnections looms, certain customers could be excused if they meet a given set of criteria, according to D.C. Water’s Nov. 2 press release.
“Some customers may be eligible for disconnection relief if they meet certain requirements such as owing less than $600 or entering a payment plan,” the press release reads. “Customers may also be eligible if certified by the Office of the Mayor of the District of Columbia, or they provide documents showing that they qualify for disconnection relief through one of these programs.” 
When customers pay their bills, D.C. Water is able to continue providing a necessary service, according to Mooring.
“The bottom line is, in order to continue providing critical water and sewer services, we need customers to get current,” Mooring wrote.

Joel Castón, an incarcerated individual elected as advisory neighborhood commissioner in Ward 7, will not be transferred out of the Washington, D.C., Central Detention Facility following reports of unsatisfactory conditions in the building.    
The U.S. Marshals Service conducted an inspection of the D.C. Jail in October, in which they found unsuitable conditions, including unsanitary conditions and the staff at the D.C. Jail punitively denying incarcerated individuals access to food and water. In response to  the inspection’s findings, 400 incarcerated people were set to be relocated out of the D.C. Jail to a prison in Lewisburg, Pa. Originally, Castón was a part of this group.
According to Castón, being transferred to another state would have robbed him of the opportunity to carry out his duties as an elected official. 
“It really puts me at a complete disadvantage to be able to carry out my job as an elected official, to advocate on behalf of my constituents here, if I am not at my post,” Castón wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Castón is the first incarcerated elected official in the District, having won a historic election on June 15 to gain a seat on Advisory Neighborhood Commission 7F. Before his election, he was a student of the Georgetown University Prisons and Justice Initiative, a program that offers incarcerated individuals the opportunity to take credit- or non-credit-bearing classes taught by Georgetown professors. 
A petition launched by Castón’s team urging the U.S. Parole Commission and the U.S. Marshals Service not to remove Castón from the D.C. Jail garnered over 400 electronic signatures. The U.S. Parole Commission announced Nov. 9 that Castón would not be transferred, allowing him to continue to carry out his role as advisory neighborhood commissioner and avoid being separated from his friends and family in and around the D.C. Jail. 
Serving the constituents of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 7F and ensuring that they are heard and represented remains the top priority, according to Castón.
“I am relieved that I get to stay at my post and serve my constituents,” Castón wrote. 
As an advisory neighborhood commissioner, Castón is in the process of working to bring attention to the unsuitable conditions within the D.C. Jail through his role as ANC commissioner, according to Castón’s team.
“When Joel was alerted that he would be among the people transferred, he was in the midst of preparing his testimony for a DC Council hearing confronting conditions at the jail,” Castón’s team wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The timing of this news presented the stunning injustice of removing Joel from his constituents when they need him most.” 
According to Castón’s team, now that efforts to prevent his relocation succeeded, the new goal will be to move up his release date, which is currently set for Dec. 22.
The U.S. Marshals Service inspection of the D.C. Jail came after defendants who are being held due to their involvement with the Jan. 6 insurrection raised concerns about conditions in the facility. 
It is unacceptable that conditions in the D.C. Jail only came under inspection when insurrection defendants complained, according to Castón’s team.
“The timing of and nature of the response absolutely shows a discrepancy between how the system responds to incarcerated individuals depending on their race,” Castón’s team wrote. “For years, the DC Jail has ignored complaints on the conditions of the jail that have been raised by advocates and family members of the mostly Black residents.”
According to Castón, the decision to prioritize the issues raised by Jan. 6 defendants while ignoring other complaints invalidates the concerns of all incarcerated individuals at the D.C. Jail.  
“My constituents feel like they have been used as a ploy. They feel like they have been used as political pawns,” Castón wrote. “There’s a lot of fear. There’s a lot of anger.”

The Georgetown University Pivot Program released its first ever annual report, showcasing the work of the program since its founding three years ago. 
The Pivot Program hosts annual cohorts for around 15 formerly incarcerated students from the Washington, D.C. area to earn a certificate in business and entrepreneurship. The program is hosted under the McDonough School of Business (MSB) and the Prisons and Justice Initiative (PJI), featuring courses taught by Georgetown faculty.
The Pivot Program provides invaluable experiences to its participants, according to Pascal Laporte, a member of the Pivot Program who graduated in 2021. 
“It’s good to know that there is a legacy and that we can create alumni from this program,” Laporte said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I got the opportunity to get more education, guidance and mentorship. It’s good to know that there is a community of people out there fighting to provide that in a carceral setting and outside upon release.”
The report highlighted the staggeringly high incarceration rates in the United States, with more than 7 million Americans currently under the control of the correctional system. In Washington, D.C., 5,000 people are released from prison or jail each year, with many struggling to find long-lasting and fulfilling employment, according to the report.
The report shows a cohesive picture of the work the Pivot Program has done over the past year, according to Marc Howard, the director of Georgetown’s Prisons and Justice Initiative.
“It really hits the marks on all fronts, whether it’s celebrating the fellows that just graduated, or promoting the program to future applicants and fellows,” Howard said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We are really contributing to a narrative shift in the value of formerly incarcerated people and their potential to the business community and as entrepreneurs.”
The Pivot Program aims to use education to combat the lack of opportunities that formerly incarcerated individuals face during reentry to society, according to Paul Almeida, dean of the MSB. 
“The faculty and staff who lead the program are as committed to changing the narrative around second-chance hiring as they are to helping our fellows, one-on-one, to bring about change in their own lives,” Almeida wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Fellows in the program are taught entrepreneurial skills and strategy and are encouraged to pursue employment opportunities, with further courses on topics including liberal arts, critical thinking and professional life skills.
David Schultz, another Pivot Program graduate who will have the opportunity to return and teach future students, said the Pivot Program was a life-changing experience.
“To be able to come back as an employed individual to assist in the facilitating of the class we teach is truly a full circle moment for me,” Schultz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The fact that this institution of higher learning has taken the time to build a curriculum to help returning citizens succeed and make a positive impact on society is something that I hope other schools and businesses replicat in the future. It has definitely changed my life.”
The 2020 cohort attended an in-person graduation ceremony in June 2021 after staff postponed it because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the report reads. The event provided a space for graduates to celebrate completing the program, according to Howard.
“It was inspiring to all be together to celebrate a successful year of having overcome not just the circumstances of returning citizens, which is already a challenge, but also through a pandemic, through a virtual year,” Howard said. “Many people when they are incarcerated, especially for a long period of time, really lose touch with technology, so the burden is very high to adjust to essentially foreign forms of communication.”
The Pivot Program creates a support system for formerly incarcerated individuals focused on their futures rather than their pasts, according to Schultz.
“One thing that is really special is being put in a network of successful individuals who can help you do nothing but succeed,” Schultz wrote. “It was also amazing to be in a ‘safe space’ where we were not judged by our mistakes but looked at as a human being just wanting to do great things in life.”

The 2020 census process failed to count 14,410 Washington, D.C. residents, even though the population increased by nearly 88,000 people. 
Data from the 2020 census results counted 689,545 residents in the District, a 14.6% growth compared to the 2010 census. While the District saw the seventh-highest growth rate in the United States, it also saw the largest undercount rate in the nation at 2.05%, which could impact how federal resources are allocated throughout the District during the next decade.
Following the release of the 2020 census results, the D.C. Council began the process of redistricting the eight wards in an effort to balance the populations in each ward, meaning that Wards 6, 7 and 8 will almost certainly have to be redrawn due to drastic population shifts, as Ward 6 is too large, while Wards 7 and 8 are too small. 
According to Samuel Rosen-Amy, chief of staff for the office of Councilmember Elissa Silverman (I-At-Large), who is the chair for the Subcommittee on Redistricting, the undercount means that the District might not be accurately funded.
“We are very concerned about the reported undercount of DC residents in the Census, since it can mean the District doesn’t receive its fair share of federal funds,” Rosen-Amy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “That can have a very real effect on our residents.”
Accurate census counts are important in terms of distributing adequate resources across the District, according to a press statement from the D.C. Office of Planning, which oversees the redistricting process along with the D.C. Council. 
“The federal government uses Census data to distribute more than $6 billion annually to the District for vital programs such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Section Eight Housing Choice Vouchers, Children’s Health Insurance, and Low-Income Home Energy Assistance,” the statement reads. “Accurate and complete census data is critical to the District’s recovery and reopening efforts as well. Knowing who lives in DC and where is important when making budgeting and planning decisions across all District agencies.”
The undercount was likely caused by difficulties regarding accurately counting people during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as former President Donald Trump’s failed attempts to introduce a citizenship question on the census form, which may have deterred people from participating. The difficulties caused Black and Hispanic populations to be undercounted at a rate of over 2%, according to the Urban Institute, an economic and social think tank based in Washington, D.C.
The Subcommittee on Redistricting is continuing with its original redistricting plans despite the undercount and is expected to hold a full D.C. Council vote on the redistricted wards Dec. 7. Under current proposals, the boundaries of Ward 2 could shift to either adopt nearby neighborhoods or lose current neighborhoods. Under two leading proposals the Shaw neighborhood, which is currently in Ward 2, would be either split between Ward 2 and Ward 6 or removed completely from Ward 2.
Ward 2 Councilmember Brook Pinto (LAW ’17) did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment.
Following the D.C. Council vote on the proposed redrawn ward maps, Ward Task Forces will assemble in December to decide upon the new boundaries for the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANC), which are the neighborhoods that make up the wards. 
While the D.C. Office of Planning pursues actions to examine the reported undercount, the Subcommittee on Redistricting must move forward, according to Rosen-Amy.
“Unfortunately, there isn’t much the Council can do about it right now,” Rosen-Amy wrote. “The Office of Planning, a Mayoral office, is looking into appealing the official count, but that process could take years.”
According to Rosen-Amy, while the undercount is concerning, the D.C. Council will continue the redistricting process with the 2020 census data.
“In the meantime, we are proceeding forward with the data we have now, which we are required by law to use when redistricting,” Rosen-Amy wrote.

Former U.S. Ambassador Melanne Verveer (SLL ’66, GRD ’69) received the Order of the Rising Sun, an honor bestowed by the Japanese government, for her leadership in advancing women’s empowerment Oct. 28.
Verveer, who serves as executive director of the Georgetown University Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS), accepted the distinction at the Japanese ambassador’s residence. Ambassador Tamaki Tsukada, the deputy chief of mission at the Embassy of Japan, conferred the award, a medal featuring gold rays.
The Order of the Rising Sun is one of the 2020 Spring Imperial Decorations, which recognize outstanding contributions to the nation or the public. The award represents a milestone in the work she continues to pursue in the field of women, peace and security, Verveer said.
“It was an extraordinary surprise,” Verveer said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It was rewarding enough to be involved in all of these ways, and then to receive this award, this decoration, went far beyond anything I had ever expected.”
Over the past two decades, Verveer has worked in many capacities to strengthen U.S.-Japan cooperation on women’s issues. Verveer served as the assistant to the President and chief of staff to the First Lady during the Clinton administration. She was later nominated by former President Barack Obama to serve as the first U.S. ambassador at-large for Global Women’s Issues, a role she held from 2009 to 2013. 
As ambassador, Verveer coordinated foreign policy issues relating to the political, economic and social advancement of women. During her tenure, Verveer said she developed a relationship with Japan because of the work she did on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), an intergovernmental forum that promotes free trade throughout the region.
Verveer said she put women and economic participation on APEC’s agenda, which had implications for the larger Asia-Pacific region. 
“I think probably the greatest impact was the work I did on APEC,” Verveer said. “That put greater prominence on the need for women’s economic participation, and everything that that involved, from child care to ensuring that there was greater diversity in the workplace.” 
Verveer provided vital advice to the Japanese government on the issue of women in the economy, according to former Ambassador Kurt Tong, who served as the U.S. ambassador for APEC when the United States hosted the forum in 2011. 
“She was essentially being recognized for the good work she did in providing thought leadership to the Japanese government and Japanese NGOs on how important it is to increase and improve the role of women in the economy, and what some of the policies might be for doing that,” Tong said in a phone interview with The Hoya.  
After coming to Georgetown, Verveer helped launch the World Assembly of Women (WAW!), a conference hosted by the Japanese government to discuss topics such as peace and security, women and the economy and other relevant issues related to women’s empowerment.
Under Verveer, GIWPS partnered with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), a development agency that promotes international cooperation. Through the partnership, Verveer contributed research and policy recommendations regarding women’s participation in economies.  
“There was a lot of synergy in our research efforts at Georgetown with JICA,” Verveer said. “I anticipate that we will continue in some capacity to work with JICA, which also recognizes the evolving questions and important discussions that occur around women peace and security.”
Japan welcomes a continued relationship with Verveer and the United States on the issue of women’s empowerment in the future, according to Yoshikazu Suzuki, the first secretary of the Embassy of Japan.
“The strong relationship between Japan and the U.S. is increasingly important for overcoming the various confusions caused by the new coronavirus and for building a new economic structure for the post-corona era, including the area of women’s empowerment,” Suzuki wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Japanese people continue to look forward to her advice and support based on her wealth of experience and clear insight.”

After over a month of preparation and a three-minute presentation, two teams of Georgetown University entrepreneurs took home the grand prize in the annual Georgetown “Bark Tank” entrepreneurship competition.
Joylet, an online baby gear renter, and STAFM Technologies, an electric flux motor, both received a $30,000 prize after tying for first place in the annual business pitch competition. In addition to the two winners, Compost’d LLC, an in-home composting initiative, won the People’s Choice Award, taking home a $25,000 cash prize. The competition awarded a total of $150,000 in prizes to eight finalists.
The 2021 Bark Tank competition was an overall success, according to Jeffrey Reid, a Georgetown professor and founder of the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative, which oversees Bark Tank.
“This year’s Bark Tank was an incredible success. The quality of startup presentations continues to go up year after year,” Reid wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Every one of the finalist teams received at least $5000 in prize money, along with intensive coaching, mentoring, and feedback. In that sense, every one of them is a winner, and every one of them has the opportunity to succeed as an entrepreneur.”
This year’s winners also represent diverse backgrounds in entrepreneurs, according to Reid.
“One thing that stands out is the diversity of our student entrepreneurs,” Reid wrote. “The majority of the prize money went to women or women-led teams, and we had several people of color and members of the LBGTQ+ community. This all goes to show that entrepreneurs come from all different backgrounds.”
The competition, which was held in person Nov. 4 as well as live-streamed, consisted of all eight finalists giving three-minute presentations, followed by a five-minute question-and-answer section with the judges, who include local business owners. Following the presentations, a group of judges deliberated and awarded cash prizes based on various criteria.
The first-place prize will allow Joylet to expand its operations, according to Joylet co-founder Alli Cavasino (GRD ’22).
“This is a real game changer for Joylet,” Cavasino wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It has already helped so much for getting the word out about our Company. With the prize money, we will be able to expand our pilot to serve more customers and test and refine our service over the coming months.”
The $30,000 cash prize will help STAFM Technologies become more competitive with other similar businesses, according to Rory Brogan (GRD ’22), founder of STAFM Technologies.
“Now the real work begins. We are using the money to build our first prototype and begin simulations to prove how disruptive this company is,” Brogan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “If all goes according to plan, we will be ready to begin a Seed round by the end of this academic year.”
The Bark Tank prize fund is sponsored by the Leonsis Family Entrepreneurship Prize, which was established by Ted Leonsis (CAS ’77), CEO of Monumental Sports & Entertainment. In addition to the two first-place prizes and the People’s Choice Award, cash prizes of various amounts totalling almost $90,000 were awarded to the five other finalists. 
The overall Bark Tank experience was incredibly valuable and meaningful to contestants, according to Gracey Owen (MSB ’22), founder of Compost’d LLC.
“Bark Tank will forever be a moment I’ll hold near and dear to my heart as it was my opportunity to really show myself what I can do,” Owen wrote in an email to The Hoya. “What started as a simple issue with my indoor compost bin quickly evolved into a blossoming business idea and with the winnings from Bark Tank so graciously provided by the Leonsis family that dream can become a reality.”
The $30,000 prize represents the culmination of a long and difficult process in launching a business venture, according to Brogan.
“I am humbled by the faith the Bark Tank judges put in us and immensely proud of what we accomplished,” Brogan wrote. “It was an incredible vote of confidence from a panel of some of the most successful entrepreneurs affiliated with Georgetown.”

Making U.S. foreign aid more accessible, equitable and responsive is the top priority for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) moving forward, USAID Administrator Samantha Power said at a Nov. 4 event.
The in-person event, titled “A New Vision for Global Development with USAID Administrator Samantha Power,” was hosted by USAID, the Walsh School of Foreign Service, the Global Human Development Program, a graduate program at Georgetown University focused on international development, and the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a nonprofit organization that advocates for a strong international affairs budget and promotes America’s international affairs programs in U.S. foreign policy.
USAID, which has worked to combat infectious diseases, reduce extreme poverty and advance democratic and economic institutions around the world, was created in 1961 following the passage of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Nov. 4 event also served as a celebration of USAID’s 60th anniversary.
In addition to continuing to focus on the organization’s key objectives, USAID will also place a greater focus on increasing accessibility and equitability in their work, according to Power. 
“We will make aid more accessible to people and organizations who want to participate,” Power said at the event. “We will make it more equitable in terms of the impact it will have on the ground. But when I say we need to make aid inclusive, I also mean we need to listen to what our partner nations actually want. Across all of our programming, we have a real opportunity to make our aid more responsive.”
Working with local business leaders and organizations is imperative to ensure thorough and long-lasting economic and humanitarian outcomes in their countries, according to Power. 
“When we partner with these local NGOs and businesses, we have an opportunity to double our impact, to not just manage a project and deliver results, which is important, but to grow the local capacity of that business or organization so its impact can be sustained long after its relationship with USAID ends,” Power said. 
As part of efforts to partner with local businesses and organizations in countries receiving aid, USAID also launched WorkWithUSAID.org Nov. 4. The website serves as a resource hub that provides information on how to partner with USAID that aims to increase the accessibility of collaboration with the organization.
Partnerships with local NGOs and companies help ensure aid helps reach more people around the world, according to Power.
“It is crucial that we engage more frequently and more intensely and sustainably with the broader range of partners that I mentioned, as they offer a scale that no single development agency can truly reach. So we have to lower barriers for these kinds of organizations and institutions to join our mission,” Power said.
In addition to programs like WorkWithUSAID.org, USAID has also launched initiatives addressing the effects of climate change in underdeveloped countries. The Scaling Up Renewable Energy (SURE) initiative works with underdeveloped countries to transition to clean energy. The Strengthening Utilities and Promoting Energy Reform (SUPER) initiative works to ensure equitable access to power while promoting renewable energy.
Initiatives like SURE and SUPER will help address a wide range of issues related to the impacts of climate change, according to Power. 
“We will help support more than 500 million people to adapt to climate change through efforts like scaling drought-tolerant agriculture, establishing early warning systems for storms and creating new insurance schemes that can support people when their harvests fail or their livestock perish,” Power said.
In all of its programs and initiatives, USAID will utilize economics and behavioral science technology to track the impact and ensure efficiency of their projects, according to Power. 
“We want to make sure that we are deploying the latest insights in economics and behavioral science to make sure our programs have the impact on underserved communities that we truly intend for them to have,” Power stated.
According to Power, USAID’s current work and initiatives represent the culmination of the agency’s 60 year history.
“Today, Americans should know that for 60 years USAID assembled some of the brightest, most dedicated and most effective public servants in the world, and they can take pride in the impact that American generosity is having on people in need around the world. That is the agency I feel so privileged to run,” Power said.

A push to restructure the Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) failed Nov. 7 after student voter turnout did not meet requisite levels to implement the constitutional change.
While 72.12% of students voted in favor of the referendum, only 20.11% of the student body, or 1,031 students, voted in the election, short of the 25% minimum voter turnout needed for constitutional referendums. If implemented, the referendum would have abolished both the GUSA Senate and Executive and replaced the bodies with a single advocacy assembly.
Despite failing, the referendum was not a complete defeat, according to GUSA Senator Bora Balçay (SFS ’23), one of two senators to introduce the referendum. 
“We take this as an approval of our mandate. We got 72% yes, which is over a thousand students’ votes,” Balçay said in an interview with The Hoya. “Even if the rest of the votes needed to meet the 25% requirement were all no votes, the referendum would still have passed because it was such an overwhelming majority.” 
Students began the push to restructure GUSA in order to increase accessibility within the organization and centralize advocacy efforts. Despite the results of the referendum, the GUSA Senate will continue to examine ways to restructure the organization, according to GUSA Senate Vice Speaker Rowlie Flores (COL ’22).
“The need for a restructure is crucial and enables participation within the association in policy advocacy so that the leadership team is not always the ones engaging with the administration on issues,” Flores wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The GUSA Senate will be open to considering another act of referendum should it come to the chamber.”
The restructuring referendum faced difficulties since the referendum proposal was first finalized in early October, with some senators arguing that the referendum did not address key aspects of GUSA’s job. While the referendum ultimately passed the senate Oct. 17, the vote was not unanimous, and a senator put forward an alternative restructuring proposal, though it did not pass.
Once the senate approved the referendum, GUSA faced problems of low student engagement on social media and in person, according to Balçay.
“We thought that it would be better to publicize the referendum later than earlier, because if you do it earlier then it loses momentum towards the end,” Balçay said. “So we planned two very intense weeks, but we failed to get turnout on most of our events. We had two town halls, numerous tablings, office hours that were five days a week, and we only managed to engage with a mere 100 students.”
GUSA should have better anticipated the lack of student enthusiasm for the referendum and started campaigning much farther ahead of time, according to GUSA Senator Zev Burton (SFS ’22), who opposed the referendum.
“I don’t think the results were surprising. That was one of the main concerns we had with having a referendum on such short notice,” Burton said in an interview with The Hoya. “People aren’t going to get excited about internal restructuring. They had so much time to publicize and do all this work, and it did not come to fruition.”
In addition to the restructuring referendum, the fall 2021 ballot also included elections for seven first-year seats and four at-large seats in the GUSA Senate. The new class of senators is set to be sworn in Nov. 14.
In upcoming meetings, the newly sworn-in senate will discuss student involvement and continue to push for restructuring, according to GUSA Senator Nirvana Khan (SFS ’24), chair of the policy and advocacy committee.
“This definitely is not the end of the restructure campaign; if anything I believe people in GUSA now have to accept how popular restructuring GUSA is and that the project is not going away anytime soon,” Khan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Personally, I think the plan moving forward will be focusing on raising awareness and conducting an information campaign so that in the future — whether in the spring or next fall — we can hopefully get this passed.”
GUSA should not consider a second restructuring referendum, according to Burton.
“I don’t think that’s the most important issue right now. Especially with COVID still going on, new registration, stuff going on at Leo’s that still isn’t fully solved, it’s time to start directing our attention out of GUSA and towards the student body,” Burton said.
Despite internal opposition to a second referendum, GUSA will still make an effort to incorporate more student opinions and voices in any upcoming restructuring initiatives, according to Balçay.
“While we are not seeking to redo the whole thing, we are open to all voices, and if anyone wants to get involved in the restructure process, I would encourage them to DM GUSA on Instagram, email GUSA and just get in touch through any channel,” Balçay said.

As public school enrollment decreases across the country, schools must allocate federal COVID-19 relief funds to offset future budget losses, a new Georgetown University study found. 
State governments distribute funding to public schools based on enrollment rates, so enrollment decreases will lead to significant budgetary cuts, according to the report. Georgetown University’s Edunomics Lab, a research center focused on education finance, released the report Oct. 28, analyzing over 6,000 districts’ projected financial losses from decreased enrollment. 
While public school enrollment nationwide decreased 3% during the 2020-2021 school year, 82% of the analyzed districts received enough COVID-19 federal relief aid to offset budgetary decreases resulting from lower enrollment. Since the federal aid was distributed based on community need, the remaining 18% of districts whose federal funding did not offset enrollment losses were almost exclusively concentrated in wealthier areas with low poverty rates, according to the study. 
However, although federal aid mostly offset budgetary declines in high-poverty districts, the federal aid is not sustainable and these districts will face severe financial loss in the future, according to Edunomics Director Marguerite Roza, Ph.D., who co-authored the study. 
“That kind of aid can only cushion schools’ budgets for about two years,” Roza said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We think there’s gonna be a massive fiscal cliff in a lot of places, when you wake up one day and you don’t have enough money to pay your bills.”
The pandemic was a driving factor in the decrease in public school enrollment, with many parents and students abandoning public schools for private and charter schools, homeschool programs, group tutoring pods and fully remote learning.
While it is unclear whether these enrollment decreases are permanent, the rise in alternative education options is a worrying trend for public schools, according to Roza. 
“The pandemic forced kids home for over a year to learn remotely, so a lot of people found some sort of education program that worked better for them,” Roza said. “So that was a tectonic shift in education.”
Since March 2020, the federal government has provided $190 billion in aid to schools in efforts to help them reopen and combat the impact of the pandemic. 
Edunomics aims to advise districts on how to best use this aid and how to make decisions that will positively impact their students, according to Chad Aldeman, the report’s co-author. 
“We focus on educating school and district leaders, people at the state level, advocates and even members of the media to help understand the pressing issues in school finance,” Aldeman said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We help district leaders think through enrollment changes and staffing and labor costs and all the different factors that go into that in terms of how to pay, how to structure compensation, how to think about turnover and how to think about different incentives.”
While federal aid has helped schools stay afloat as they transition back to in-person learning, schools must avoid overspending on extracurricular programs and hiring more teachers and instead save money for when the funds inevitably run out, according to Roza.
“Historically, school districts have not known how to shrink, and they tend to enact policies that make shrinking harder,” Roza said. “We rely on district leaders to decide how to spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Very few, if any, of them have been taught about education finance.”
To adjust to enrollment trends, districts will have to make changes that will be uncomfortable, such as laying off teachers. However, waiting will only exaggerate the effect on students, according to Roza. 
“They don’t like to say we’re going to let go of these people, and so they’ve kept them on longer and longer and longer,” Roza said. “So when they ultimately find that they do not have enough money to pay the bills for the rest of the year, they have to do it all at once. It’s very disruptive to make cuts all at once. It causes kids to lose teachers mid-year, and it strips the programs that students rely on.”
In order to stay ahead of future financial loss, individual districts must think critically about how many students will enroll, and act proactively to best serve them, according to Aldeman.
“A lot of this is in flux and districts at the end of day will have to balance their budgets based on the students they serve,” Aldeman said. “And so we think it would be a good idea now for districts to calculate how many students they can expect to enroll in the coming years and then tailor their budgets accordingly.”

The disparity between education costs and the incomes of young college graduates is increasing and should be tackled through a unified effort by schools, employers and governments, according to a recent Georgetown University report. 
Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy recently published a report titled, “If Not Now, When?”, which revealed that while the cost of college has increased 169% since 1980, average wages have only increased 19%.
College education is becoming more essential for people to be successful in the workforce, yet it is also becoming less affordable, the report found. Today, two-thirds of jobs require postsecondary education, while in the 1970s three-quarters of jobs only required a high school diploma or less, according to the report. 
“Postsecondary education policy has failed to keep higher education affordable even as formal education beyond high school has become more essential,” the report reads. “The costs of higher education have risen rapidly over the past few decades, making cost a barrier for many young people who wish to pursue a degree or credential.” 
However, the increasing necessity of a college education has also contributed to the rising costs, according to Artem Gulish, Senior Policy Strategist and Research Faculty at the Center on Education and the Workforce. 
“The demand for college education is growing due to higher value placed on knowledge and skills students develop during their additional years of education and postsecondary credentials in the workforce,” Gulish wrote in an email to The Hoya.
While students used to be able to pay their way through college without significant challenges, paying off student debt has now become largely impossible for many due to shrinking wages following graduation, the report found. 
“It used to be possible to work one’s way through college; today, college costs are generally too high — and young people’s wages too low — for that to be feasible,” the report reads. “Consequently, more students have to take on larger amounts of debt to get a college degree.”
As the cost of college rises, recent graduates are taking longer to become financially independent, according to Gulish. 
“It also impacts young workers’ ability to attain financial security earlier in their lives. This doesn’t mean that overall there is anything wrong with young people taking longer to find themselves,” Gulish wrote. “However, it does mean that policymakers need to recognize that the transition to financially independent adulthood has gotten longer and more complex and adapt our youth policy to better support young people facing these new realities.”
The disparity between education and wages differs significantly between race and class, the report found, as less advantaged students are less likely to improve their socioeconomic status (SES) in the workforce, even with educational success.
“A kindergartner with top test scores and a family in the lowest SES quartile has only a 31 percent chance of being in the top half of SES at age 25, compared to a 71 percent chance for a kindergartner with bottom test scores and a family in the highest SES quartile,” the report reads.  
To tackle the severe disparities between education and young people’s wages, there needs to be collaboration between all stages of the education and employment process, according to Anthony Carnevale, the report’s lead author and Director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.
“We haven’t connected the dots from early childhood, through K-12 and postsecondary education, to careers,” Carnevale wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We need an all-one-system approach that facilitates smooth transitions on the pathway from youth dependence to adult independence.” 
Moving forward, institutions need to work together to support young people throughout their education and early careers, according to Gulish. 
“I think it’s a shared responsibility: schools and colleges have a role to play, employers have a role to play, local communities have a role to play, counselors and advisors have a role to play, workforce developers have a role to play, training programs have a role to play, families have a role to play, and young people have a role to play,” Gulish wrote. “Federal and state governments, though, are in the best position to coordinate all these efforts to ensure that youth policy functions as all-one system and vulnerable young people do not fall through the cracks.”

A Georgetown University delegation attended the 26th iteration of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), aiming to uplift stories of women’s climate activism around the world. 
Representatives from the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS) traveled to the conference, which took place in Glasgow, Scotland from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. GIWPS Senior Program and Policy Coordinator Jess Keller, Research and Policy Director Jessica Smith, Executive Director Melanne Verveer and Allie Smith,  Program Director made up the GIWPS delegation to COP26. 
The GIWPS team attended the conference with the goal of centering the voices of women and girls in international discussions about climate change, according to Jeni Klugman, the managing director at GIWPS.
“The main message is around the importance of bringing women and girls into the conversation and bringing their expertise and perspective about advancing and implementing solutions,” Klugman said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
Understanding the nexus of gender, climate and security is an essential component of GIWPS’s research, according to Keller and Smith.
“COP26 has been a huge success for our team and an important moment to catalyze gender-responsive climate action,” Keller and Smith wrote. “These are issues that are often talked about separately — but their intersections are critical to our understanding of the gendered impacts of climate change and to identifying effective solutions.”
Women tend to be underrepresented at all levels of climate decision-making, according to UN Women. The status of women in a country is often correlated with the ability of that same country to act toward climate solutions, according to Keller and Smith. 
“We know from our Women, Peace and Security Index that where women are doing better, countries are more stable and peaceful,” Keller and Smith wrote. “Recent analysis also found that countries that score better on our WPS Index are also better positioned to address climate change.”
The GIWPS recently published its third edition of the Women, Peace and Security Index (WPS Index) on Oct. 19, which reports on the status of women’s inclusion, justice and security by providing national index scores and rankings for 170 countries. 
The 2021 WPS Index highlighted that the global advance of women’s status has slowed and that the gap within the range of scores has grown. The Index also highlighted how women’s contributions to climate solutions in Colombia, Sudan and Nepal proved effective in mitigating climate-conflict risks.
While at COP26, the GIWPS team spent their time listening to grassroots women activists, Indigenous women, and youth leaders on the frontlines of climate change, according to Keller and Smith. The team also met with delegates from the UNFCCC gender team, foreign ministers, UN Under-Secretaries-General and private sector leaders at the conference.
COP26 organizers also selected GIWPS to host an official panel event Nov. 8 titled “Sustainability, Equality, Peace: Integrating Climate Change & Women, Peace and Security Agendas,” which brought together policymakers, civil society leaders and climate activists for a discussion about the intersection of climate change and gender. 
As the world seeks to address the climate crisis, stakeholders must ensure women are centered in interventions, that climate policy is gender-sensitive and that women have full and equal access to these opportunities, according to Keller and Smith.
“We are seeing growing momentum by governments including the United States and international institutions, such as the UN Security Council and NATO to address climate security and GIWPS is working to ensure policies, investments, and interventions leverage the contributions of women on the frontlines,” Keller and Smith wrote.
COP26 was initially scheduled to take place in November 2020, but involved parties collectively decided to postpone the conference until 2021 due to safety risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. COP26 was a highly anticipated conference for GIWPS, Klugman said. 
“I think this conference is in many ways historic. This unprecedented attention — I can’t recall a previous conference to which so much mainstream media attention has been directed,” Klugman said. “This is a high-profile opportunity to show how we can work in collaboration with others.” 
The conference provided a forum where the GIWPS representatives could highlight women’s work on climate change in an international forum, according to Keller and Smith.
“GIWPS is thrilled to be attending COP as part of the Georgetown delegation. This has been an important opportunity for us to further our climate work and deepen relationships with others committed to centering women in climate action,” Keller and Smith wrote.

Georgetown University students are petitioning the university to accommodate international students who need on-campus housing during winter break.
The petition, which has been signed by 54 students, urges the university to allow international students to remain in on-campus residence halls for winter break given pandemic-induced housing insecurity between Dec. 18, 2021, and Jan. 11, 2022. The university typically shuts down residence halls during winter break, barring students from returning to their dorms until the beginning of spring semester.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created travel and safety barriers that prevent international students from returning to their permanent residences, according to the petition. 
“This year has proven to be difficult for all of us. For international students, however, particular challenges remain, of which winter housing insecurities create the most burden and stress. Many of us are unable to return home this winter as the quarantine time simply exceeds our break, not to mention the difficulty in securing international flights and the continuous risk of being exposed to the virus,” the petition reads. 
Yichu Huang (SFS ’23), an international student who co-authored the petition, said students felt compelled to write the petition after the office of residential living gave unclear information.
“The emails that I received and some of the emails that my friends received from residential living had different wordings,” Huang said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “We were very confused about what the school was trying to say and I think that residential living was equally confused as well. I think it was just a few staff members having incomplete information and trying to respond to us.”
According to an email to international students obtained by The Hoya, despite the Office of Residential Living’s pressure on higher university administrators, the university does not have a plan to house international students during winter break.
“Unfortunately, even with our department’s added pressure on senior leadership, we still do not have any direction on whether campus housing options will be available to some students during winter break,” the Oct. 28 email reads. 
This year, international students may experience high travel costs and stringent quarantine requirements, according to Andrea Ho (SFS ’24), who signed the petition. 
“International students face unique challenges compared to domestic students as not all of them can return home due to factors such as high costs of travel and quarantine, complicated quarantine procedures in our home countries, and the general difficulty of procuring international flights,” Ho wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This creates a lot of stress on international students to find housing over the winter break, especially nearing finals seasons.”
The university should not expect international students to find short-term housing options for winter break, according to Huang. 
“Finding short leases in D.C. is quite hard, and even though there is the option of Airbnb, I think that with COVID being around it isn’t the safest choice,” Huang said. “It also isn’t affordable, as the price range differs a lot. There’s also a lot of transactional and organizational costs, which results in logistical difficulties.”
According to a university spokesperson, administrators are meeting with students in the coming days to discuss options for international students. 
“We understand the concern around winter housing and have a meeting scheduled with student leaders this week to discuss the issue further with them,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We hope to communicate with all on-campus students as soon as we’re able.”
On Nov. 8, the United States lifted international travel bans put in place in February and March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic; travelers can now enter the United States with proof of full vaccination. However, other countries still have precautions and mandatory quarantines in place. For instance, as of Nov. 8, China requires all travelers to quarantine for 14 days upon entering the country.
Additionally, many international students are likely to face difficulties securing housing over the winter break, according to Kelly He (MSB ’23), who conducted a survey of approximately 50 international students. He found that 84% of participants reported a desire to stay in their on-campus residence during winter break. 
Ho said she hopes the petition will raise awareness for issues international students face on campus. 
“I really hope the administration can look into this matter and assist international students even if it decides to shut campus down,” Ho wrote. “Many international students have worked so hard for an opportunity to study in the US and it’s awful when they’re neglected by the administration in crucial decisions that involve them.” 
Huang said she would like to see a response from the university about housing for international students. 
“My genuine hope is that they would give us a clear response, whether that be a yes or no. I would want a definite answer, and that is the most important thing I am looking for,” Huang said. “Vague wording at this time of year would be very frustrating.”
