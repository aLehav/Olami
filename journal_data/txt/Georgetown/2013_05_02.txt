Though no concrete plans for construction of the Intercollegiate Athletics Center have been announced, alumni newsletter Georgetown Today released a video last week of the proposed interior design for the building.
Though photos of the IAC’s exterior were released in 2011, the video, originally shown at the Campaign Executive Council Plenary Session at John Carroll Weekend in London from April 18 to 23, is the first time photos of the interior design have been released.
The video, produced by real-estate consulting service Arnold Imaging, shows the planned lower-level practice gym with a full-sized basketball court. It also shows an area with tables that appears to be a study space. Though the video does not highlight the area, there also appears to to be a small outdoor quad in the center of the IAC.
The IAC, formerly known as the Athletic Training Facility, is slated to be built adjacent to McDonough Arena. The D.C. Zoning Commission initially approved the concept for the building as part of the 2000 Campus Plan, but a series of delays and the 2008 recession stalled its progress. The Old Georgetown Board and the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts approved preliminary plans for the building last April.
As of one year ago, the center was planned as a two-story, 125,000-square-foot building designed to house practice space, offices and locker rooms for the men’s and women’s basketball teams on the ground floor, and weight, training and equipment rooms on the lower floor.

The New Student Convocation Committee has selected Freeman Condon (NHS ’14) to deliver the annual welcome speech to the class of 2017 in August.
Condon, winner of the 2013 McTighe Prize, is a human science and international health double major, a member of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps and chapter president of Georgetown’s Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.
The prize, given in memory of former philosophy professor Thomas P. McTighe, is given annually to a student who has engaged in outstanding scholarship and service during his or her time at Georgetown. Applicants for the award submit an essay detailing their dedication to the Jesuit and academic values that Georgetown espouses.
Condon, who learned about his award Tuesday, based his essay on the quote, “To whom much is given, much is asked.”
“I came at that from the perspective that everyone who graduates from Georgetown is given a lot in our education,” he said. “I talked about how everyone sort of owes something back, whether to the community or their family or to their nation.”
Condon’s application essay will form the basis of his speech at New Student Convocation in August.
“I’m excited because I’m being given a very wide audience in the freshmen and it’s really saying to me to have the potential to deliver one of the first things they hear at Georgetown,” Condon said. “One of the first things that they’re going to hear at Georgetown is my call to service. It’s exciting for me to be able to address them so young and hopefully have an impact.”
