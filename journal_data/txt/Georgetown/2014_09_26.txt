Like many Georgetown students, Indra Acharya (COL ’18) is interested in pursuing a career in public service.
He imagines himself running for the Senate in Vermont someday, or perhaps serving as a Supreme Court Justice. Like many ambitious freshmen, he ran for a position in the Georgetown University Student Association senate at-large. His interest in politics, though, stems from a unique, personal and painful history.
Acharya was born in a refugee camp in Nepal after his parents were expelled from their home country of Bhutan. Acharya said that his family’s expulsion followed ethnic cleansing and violence in Bhutan after the Lhotshampa, a group of southerners with a Nepalese cultural identity, began to demand rights from their oppressive king.
“When people started demanding for their rights, [the king] started using his violent force, killing people, raping women,” Acharya said. “My parents, who were never politically involved, [being] from that particular ethnic group was the main reason for them to be refugees.”
Growing up in a refugee camp, Acharya said that he experienced feelings of dehumanization that troubled him.
“You don’t have any identity,” Acharya said. “I still remember not having enough food to eat for days. We had to depend on the humanitarian organizations and refugee services; there was no food and clothes. I used to depend on people in local communities to bring the clothes that their children wore for years.”
Acharya said the conditions in the camp were poor, and also dangerous.
“I lived in a hut, bamboo and thatch,” he said. “I called it the
‘life of hell’ because, to me, if there was a hell in this world, it is the refugee camp. … You have no sense of pride in being a human, people can come kill you any time they want and no one is going to ask them any questions.”
Despite the conditions Acharya faced in the refugee camp, he still managed to find a way to make his voice heard in the community and turned to his education as an escape.
He found his voice through creative writing, as well as through leadership positions. He described how, when he was in eighth grade, he became a student program supervisor and created a space where students could share their opinions and advocate for educational changes.
In 2012, Acharya’s family moved to the United States, settling in Winooski, Vt. Acharya said that he began to develop a true identity upon arrival, unfettered by the fear he once faced in Nepal.
“[Before], I had no food to eat,” Acharya said. “Nothing. You live in that state of survival and when I came here, we were counted as human, I had my identity. I was identified as a human. … I felt I was lucky enough because then I could try to find the ways to better my life.”
However, Acharya said that as an immigrant in the United States, he still faced challenges, many of which stemmed from racism and classism.
He wanted to attend school, but the Refugee Resettlement group told him instead to start working as a dishwasher. Acharya, however, was determined to pursue his education.
He attended Winooski High School and then applied to the Vermont Academy of Science and Technology Program at Vermont Technical College in Randolph, where he earned his high school diplomas. Acharya still faced setbacks in school, such as being forced to take an English as a Foreign Language class, despite the fact that he grew up speaking English.
Acharya found mentors in Vermont through his relationship with Katherine Decarreau, the Winooski City Manager, whom he met while working on a school project. However, he said that the refugee resettlement program faces many challenges.
“They are in a very challenging position, [they’re] not particularly well-funded by the government and they are being looked to here to solve a whole multitude of problems across a number of cultures,” Decarreau said. “It’s easy for anybody to group a whole population and make general statements when you’re faced with an awful lot of people.”
Peter Yankowski, Acharya’s neighbor and mentor, agreed that refugee resettlement does not always do enough to help refugees.
“They give them a couple of weeks of support and the refugees are the ones that lift themselves up [by their] bootstrap[s],” Yankowski said.
Acharya said that he hopes to help alter the way that refugee resettlement organizations view the people they work with.
“I see myself as a lotus. It grows in the marsh where you throw the garbage, but still it is the most beautiful flower you can ever find,” Acharya said. “There are these amazing people with amazing potential in the refugee camps. We as Americans have failed at educating people and getting them integrated in our society, so I would focus on education, social integration, and if a person is educated and knows how to communicate with people they will be able to find jobs.”
Acharya, a Gates Millennium Scholar, said that he ran for GUSA senate because he hopes to be a voice for students while embodying authentic student leadership.
“I’m not running for GUSA to change what I think is wrong, I’m going to change what students as a whole say is wrong,” Acharya said before results were released.
Results of the GUSA election were not available at press time.
Decarreau said that she is excited to see what Acharya will achieve in the future.
“I’m thrilled that Indra wound up here and he made a huge impression on the community and will continue to give a lot to our community,” Deccareau said. “[I] can’t wait to see what he does next.”
Yankowski agreed, and said that Acharya will serve as inspiration for many in the future because of his positive attitude and empathetic personality.
“[He is] an awesome inspiration for the community, all the youth in the community of all ages and ability and aspiration,” Yankowski said. “He’s a very selfless person. … Along the way, other students have benefitted from the path that he’s forging.”
To Acharya, the United States holds potential that he hopes to discover during his time on campus.
“I don’t see myself going back to Nepal,” Acharya said. “I am American. I am a proud American, even if a lot of people have a hard time trusting me as American. This is my country. This is the country where I had my first nationality.”

The White House and Center for American Progress’s Generation Progress, an organization promoting awareness of on-campus sexual assault, launched the public awareness campaign “It’s On Us” last week as part of the Obama administration’s continued efforts to prevent sexual violence at the nation’s universities.
Georgetown joined the list of nearly 200 universities nationwide whose student leaders have agreed to promote the campaign against sexual assault on their respective campuses.
“At Georgetown our work for many years on this issue has been guided by our commitment to cura personalis, care of the whole person — mind, body, and spirit. Educating and engaging our community on this issue is an essential part of our responsibility to uphold the moral expectations that have guided us throughout our history as a Jesuit institution,” University President John J. DeGioia wrote in a university-wide email.
Tina Tchen, executive director of the White House Council on Women and Girls and chief of staff to the first lady, stressed the importance of spreading sexual assault awareness at universities.
“Everyone has the right to live free from the threat of sexual assault,” Tchen said in a conference call with college media Monday. “Still today, one in five women will be sexually assaulted while in college.”
The campaign named four goals for colleges: distributing campus climate surveys to assess the extent of the problem on their campuses, preventing sexual assault, responding effectively when assault occurs and increasing transparency on enforcement efforts.
“Our goal of this campaign is to both change culture nationally but also to empower students on local campuses to be able to create campaigns and engage new people in the fight to end campus sexual assault,” said Anne Johnson, executive director of Generation Progress, a nonprofit organization that advocates for social and political policy through student leaders on college campuses and a co-sponsor of the campaign, said on the call.
“It’s On Us” will focus on engaging students and promoting better recognition of the problems of sexual assault. The campaign asked students to sign an online pledge in order to create an environment that does not tolerate sexual assault. More than 37,000 people have taken the pledge so far.
“Bystanders play a key role in preventing, discouraging, and/or intervening when an act of violence has potential to occur,” Tchen said.
Take Back the Night President Sarah Rabon (COL ’16) was wary that the pledge could have the opposite effect.
“Campaigns like this can sometimes provide rationalizations for complacency,” Rabon said. “The act of signing the pledge may cause someone to feel as if they’ve effectively done their part, but in reality, the epidemic of sexual assault is one that will only be resolved after a long period of hard work by many.”
In addition to the pledge, the Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women gave $6 million to 18 colleges to develop programs on prevention and response to sexual assault. Johnson said the mission of the program was a holistic change in the response to sexual assault at universities.
“This is an ‘all hands on deck’ kind of campaign, and we are really going to change the way that we think about campus sexual assault,” Johnson said. “We need to engage media entities, domestic violence prevention groups, sports organizations and campus groups.”
Despite this increased push, the organizers have struggled to involve men in the conversation, one of the primary goals of the campaign.
“A lot of men are really uncomfortable with sexual assault, but they don’t speak up because they think that other men approve of this kind of behavior, when in fact they don’t,” Johnson said.
“It’s On Us” plans to educate children in grades K-12, engaging them in age-appropriate conversations to emphasize the problem. Rabon stressed the importance of beginning education against sexual assault culture at a young age.
“Conversations around consent, bystander intervention and supporting survivors could be normalized and deepened if we, as a society, had them earlier and more often,” she said.
Georgetown recently updated its sexual misconduct policy, following guidelines set by the White House’s Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, which was formed in January. The changes allow sexual assault survivors to avoid face-to-face interactions with their perpetrators during hearings, limit the number of people involved in a case and force the university to assign outside investigators to examine the cases.
Georgetown’s Sexual Assault Services Specialist Bridget Sherry Laizer praised student sexual assault peer educators for their influence in promoting positive change.
“SAPE students played a critical role last year in many of the new policy changes that came about, including the Survivor Bill of Rights and addition of a new clinical staff member in Health Education Services for Sexual Assault Services,” Laizer said.
Rabon emphasized the necessity of individual action, in addition to the White House campaign and administrative changes, to create a safer environment and prevent sexual assault.
“Day-to-day efforts should be taken by students to make this campus safer for all students, as people of all genders are affected by sexual assault. A primary tool students can use is bystander intervention,” Rabon said. “If students both look out for each other and refuse to passively accept displays of predatory behavior by others, this campus can become much safer for everyone.”

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak spoke about the future of Asia’s government and security in Gaston Hall on Tuesday.
Razak’s lecture, which focused on key issues such as the rise of China and the role of the United States in a multipolar international order, marked the first Lecture Fund event featuring a head of government this academic year.
“The way we respond to these issues will determine Asia’s future,” Razak said. “Confronted with the complex disagreements between states, Asia must place its trust in diplomatic solutions.”
Gaston Hall was filled with students as well as members of delegations from both the Malaysian and U.S. governments Tuesday.
After recognizing the past dominance of the United States on the global stage, Razak then discussed the emergence of many Asian powers including China, Japan and India, not only in regard to their economic transformation but also their political reforms.
“We must heed the fundamental principles upon which diplomacy is conducted: sovereign equality, respect for territorial integrity, peaceful settlement of disputes and mutually benefiting relations,” Razak said.
Razak, who came to Georgetown after attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, also emphasized his personal connection to the university during his speech, praising the education two of his children received in the School of Foreign Service and reminding students to tread carefully, both on the Exorcist Steps and on the seal outside of Healy Hall.
The prime minister talked about the positive influence of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which Malaysia will chair in 2015. He asserted that the ASEAN code of conduct can help alleviate disagreements like those surrounding the territorial claims on the South China Sea.
Razak outlined key questions and issues that he believes will shape the future of Asia, regarding the rise of China and other nation’s reactions to Chinese leadership, the role of the United States in a multipolar world, and the shifting position of Japan in the 21st century.
After Razak finished his comments he spoke with US-ASEAN Business Council Vice President of Policy Marc Mealy. During this time, Razak condemned the actions of the Islamic State Group.
“They don’t speak for us. Whatever they are, and whatever actions they’ve done, they are against Islam, they are against God and they are against humanity,” Razak, whose country is primarily Muslim, said.
He stated that religious freedom in Malaysia has embraced the true ideals of Islam, which has resulted in over 40 years of peace and stability.
During a question-and-answer session following the talk, students asked Razak about issues ranging from the banned study of political science in Myanmar to his personal advice for young people.
One student questioned the heavy media censorship and the treatment of the ethnic elite in Malaysia, prompting a response from Razak that stressed Malaysia’s emphasis on democracy and an open society that can be clearly seen on social media.
Monica Mahal (COL ’17), who attended the event, said that she was impressed by Razak’s lecture.
“The prime minister touched upon a lot of themes that apply to all types of Georgetown students,” Mahal said. “He handled his questions very graciously, and he also shed light onto his personality which made the whole conversation much more enjoyable. … Overall it was really an informative and very enriching lecture.”

The MedStar Georgetown Transplant Institute opened a new $2.4 million outpatient clinic on Tuesday in an attempt to improve the patient experience and consolidate transplant-related care. Backed by corporate and hospital funding from the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, the new clinic will begin seeing clients Monday.
The 19,000 square foot space, located at the MedStar Georgetown Pasquerilla Healthcare Center, consists of 17 new outpatient rooms for kidney, small bowel, liver, multivisceral and pediatric patients, an upgrade from the previous 11,500 square-foot space with six rooms.
“With greater capacity comes greater efficiency,” David Zwerski, assistant vice president of the Transplant Institute, said.
The clinic addresses the ever-growing transplant business and demand for transplants at the MedStar Georgetown Hospital. In an average year, the Institute performs from 300 to 320 transplants and hundreds of other operations.
“We had really outgrown this space,” MedStar Georgetown Transplant Institute Executive Director Thomas Fishbein (MED ’89) said. “We have so many physicians and patients that we literally could not see them in the current space that we’re in.”
The new design places doctors, researchers and other health professionals closer to the patients, streamlining the multi-step bureaucracy of transplant-related care and allowing the clinic to attend to the physical and emotional needs of the patients.
“It facilitates single encounter care,” Fishbein said. “It is an evolution toward patient-centered care, rather than doctor-centered care. It was very convenient for the doctors in the old-fashioned way, but now it is very focused around the patient experience.”
In addition to creating a more efficient patient experience, the clinic also aims to improve the emotional experience of the patient, for example by facilitating interactions between patients and social workers.
“Patient experience translates to high quality of care and a welcoming environment,” Zwerski said. “We have to make the best of their experience and be receptive to patients, because we know that they’re not always going to get good news.”
Georgetown University Hospital spokesperson Marianne Worley also pointed to the design of the waiting room, which includes paintings and a screen showing educational videos for patients and families to learn more about their condition, as an example of the patient-centric nature of the clinic.
“The theme is rebirth, like the cherry blossoms, spring and the water, because a lot of people feel like when they have a new organ they have a rebirth,” Worley said. “These things are all really important to them. It doesn’t have to feel like a doctor’s office.”
The Medical Center founded the Center for Translational Transplant Medicine in March 2013, which merged with the transplant research already being conducted at the University. Fishbein is the center’s co-director.
“We have 30 to 40 clinical trials open at any given time for patients who are being treated in the transplant institute,” Fishbein said.
By adding space for the center to operate in the clinic itself, researchers can now work among doctors and patients, creating parallels between clinical trials and actual patient work.
“The interdisciplinary element of the clinic will allow us to see patients and, in parallel, have research opportunities, which is for the betterment of transplantation,” Zwerski said.
Fishbein was optimistic about the impact the clinic would have on the Georgetown community.
“The future of Georgetown medicine is here,” he said.

Three Georgetown faculty members have signed an Iraq Rescue plea calling for U.S. military intervention against the Islamic State group.
Director of the Berkley Center’s Religious Freedom Project Thomas Farr, government and international affairs professor Robert Lieber and philosophy Professor Emeritus Daniel Robinson are signatories of the plea, which urges “the United States and the international community [to] act immediately and decisively to stop ISIS/ISIL genocide and prevent the further victimization of religions minorities,” according to the Iraq Rescue website.
The plea was written in response to recent acts of terror perpetrated by the terrorist group, also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, which include beheadings, executions, amputations and acts of sexual violence.
Lieber, professor in both the department of government and the School of Foreign Service, joined this initiative at the invitation of Princeton University professor Robert George.
“The plea is first a recognition that ISIS represents a great danger in the region, threatening to potentially dominate an important part of that strategic location,” Lieber said. “It also butchers or threatens to kill, or crucify those of minority religions. It is a horrifying operation and a growing danger to the region and to U.S. national interests. You’ll find leading members of both parties in Congress, as well as the president, recently making statements that are consistent with those that we had recommended before.”
Farr said he views the Islamic State group as a clear and direct threat to the United States and to religious minorities in the Middle East.
“I believe that military action is necessary,” Farr wrote in an email. “It must be carried out with precision and overwhelming force in order to remove the immediate threat, and with every possible precaution to avoid harm to innocents.”
However, Farr also said he believes that the religious ideology fueling the Islamic State group cannot be defeated by force alone. Instead, he urges Muslims in the region to rise against the extremists.
“It must be eliminated by Muslims who live in the nations where it is incubated. In order to do that, Muslims must have religious freedom, which they currently lack,” Farr wrote. 
The plea supports President Barack Obama’s decision to perform airstrikes, but states that there is still much more to be done to combat Islamic State aggression. It also endorses The Washington Post’s call in a recent editorial for the United States to provide arms to the Kurdish and Sunni people in Iraq, since their lack of modern weapons makes it difficult for them to counter Islamic State group attacks.
Nicolo Donna dalle Rose (SFS ’15), a member of the Middle East Youth Network, said he has mixed feelings about this initiative.
“Supposedly, most of these would go to the Iraqi Kurds and some of these to factions in Syria, however, every single time in the last decades that Kalashnikovs or other weapons of this sort have been injected into the region, they stayed in the region, and switched sides very often,” Rose said.
The plea also includes an appeal for humanitarian aid by demanding its expansion. It urges the United States to take leadership in providing food, water, medicine and other essential supplies to innocent people impacted by ISIS.

Arafat says 
September 26, 2014 at 9:58 am
I’ve got a novel idea. Let’s do nothing. Let the Muslims deal with their own problems for a change. Let’s let countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait with their endless ocean of money and Western-bought armaments figure it out instead. Surely they – being practitioners of the religion of compassion and peace – will step right up to the plate in our stead.
OK, you caught me there. You knew I was kidding! You knew what I know which is that there is no answer to these Islamic cesspools. Whatever we do will be discredited and if we do nothing then Syria will become just another country in the endless line of Hell on Earth Islamic countries.
We cannot save Muslims from themselves. It is like trying to save an alcoholic. Until they are ready to abandon their religion – a religion that emphasizes aggression and violence and sadism – anything we do will simply be a band-aid on a gaping wound.
Let them go through their DTs on their own. Only then will they be ready for our friendship and help, and only then will we find a way forward together as friends.

After a failed attempted to create a doctorate program in English in the 1990s, the English department has drafted a new proposal to create an English Ph.D. program that will prepare its students to enter careers both inside and outside academia.
“We’re trying to do something really different. We will be the first new English Ph.D. program in the country in many, many decades actually,” said Ricardo Ortiz, associate professor of U.S. Latino literature and culture, who was involved in crafting the proposal.
Georgetown is one of the only major universities without an English Ph.D. program.
“It’s kind of shocking that a place with the statute of Georgetown and the reputation of our department does not have a Ph.D.,” Georgetown English professor and supporter of the proposal Henry Schwarz said.
Unlike standard English Ph.D. programs, this one proposes an increased focus on interdisciplinary study and work experience, as well the option for students to choose alternative final projects over a traditional dissertation such as digital projects, translations or public scholarships.
“We would imagine the Ph.D. in English, which would also be a Ph.D. in the critical study of culture, would be a really great foundation for somebody wanting to do museum work, somebody wanting to do a certain kind of culture-based writing in journalism, which I think there’s more of than there used to be … anybody who wanted to work for culture-based nonprofits or NGOs, and even sort of in the public sector,” Ortiz said.
The program proposal was approved by the English department faculty in March and is still awaiting approval from the administration and the board of directors. If given the green light, the program would accept three students a year with an eventual cap of 12 participants in the program at a time. Applicants to the program are required to have a bachelor’s degree, a master’s
degree in English and a developed and focused research project in mind.
The proposed Ph.D. program reflects several of the suggested improvements to doctoral programs listed in a recent report from the Modern Language Association, which was released shortly after the proposal was drafted.
“The MLA report suggests that our program reflects contemporary thought about what a doctoral education in English ought to look like in the 21st century,” associate professor and Chair of the English Department Kathryn Temple said.
In order to make sure the Ph.D. candidates graduate from the program prepared for a competitive job market, participants will be required to complete a three-credit humanities-related internship, such as working as the curator at a museum or working at a cultural organization like the Folger Shakespeare Library.
“We’re really thinking about what we’re doing as kind of providing a model for doing doctoral level work in literary and cultural studies that will be relevant to the 21st century,” Ortiz said.
Students interested in a career in academia who are seeking a more traditional English Ph.D. experience are also welcome to participate in the program.
“We’re offering students certainly the opportunity to pursue traditional topics. It’s possible to come into the program and do a very standard Ph.D.,” Temple said.
Other changes to the traditional Ph.D. program include a more concentrated completion time estimate of four years, as opposed to 10 to 12 years spent in some Ph.D. programs.
“I know that there are current faculty that think that even students who are working very hard, more than full-time, on the degree can’t finish in the four-year period, but I suspect they can,” Temple said. “My view is that a lack of structure tends to encourage people to stay in Ph.D. programs way too long.”
According to Temple, the program would be funded partly by the departmental funds within the English master’s program, as well as by other programs within Georgetown that want to work with Ph.D. students and through internships. If the internships the Ph.D. students complete for university credit happen to be paid, the money will go into the program. She added that the program’s small size will allow the department to provide closer mentorship and to provide adequate funding.
“Unlike some Ph.D. programs, we’re not going to accept anyone unless we can stipend them, and give them full tuition scholarship,” she said.
Temple said that she thought the doctorate program would benefit other English programs at Georgetown, such as the master’s program, because the English Ph.D. students could work as teaching assistants or tutors.
“It’s a natural thing that if you’re in a program where some of the students are more advanced than you, you’re going to have a stronger program and you’re going to get a better education,” Temple said. “I guess it’s controversial in that some people think that when you bring in a Ph.D. program, it weakens the commitment to the undergrad program or to the master’s program, and I tend to think it makes for a stronger program for everyone.”
Daniel Shore, an associate professor of English at Georgetown, questioned whether the program actually fulfilled the definition of a Ph.D. in an interview with The Chronicle of Higher Education.Shore declined to comment to The Hoya.
“What we’re planning to call a Ph.D. program is, in essence, an advanced master’s program,” Shore told the Chronicle. “It’s enriching them. It’s teaching them, which is valuable. It could potentially give people other career opportunities outside of the tenure track. But it is not accomplishing the job for which I understand the Ph.D. to exist.”
However, current master’s students in the department were receptive to the proposal.
“Given the academically rigorous and supportive nature of the M.A. program, the Ph.D. program would undoubtedly offer students a meaningful experience that would result in more post-graduate, professional opportunities,” Caitlin O’Leary (GRD ’15) wrote in an email.
Although she acknowledged the current strength of the department, Samantha Reid (GRD ’16) thought the Ph.D. program would attract more qualified students and better resources, but noted that it might also constrain resources for the rest of the department.
“In other graduate programs, the Ph.D. students typically have access to the best resources, often prioritized over any M.A. students. That obviously does not occur in our department. However, a Ph.D. program might attract more resources for the department, providing more access and benefits for the entire program. Difficulties might include lack of funding and strains on current staff and faculty,” Reid wrote.
In particular, students applauded the proposal’s career-minded focus.
“An English Ph.D. program that doesn’t tout itself as focused on job preparation is seriously out of touch,” Reid wrote. “I think it shows strategy and marketing.”
She said she would be interested in a Ph.D. program at Georgetown in order to further her education in English beyond a master’s degree.
“Well, barely six weeks into the M.A. and I’m already distressed I’ll only have two years at this program, which has some incredible offerings from very strong professors. Everyone says an English Ph.D. is for future academics and professors only — maybe a job-preparation Ph.D. would help me find other avenues to use the knowledge base that comes with a Ph.D,” Reid wrote.
Schwarz said that he thought an English Ph.D., even in today’s job market, is an invaluable education that can provide students with key skills, such as reading and writing, advanced critical research and organization.
“I think a humanistic education is its own reward. I honestly don’t think you can get the life skills and the intellectual and spiritual insights of an advanced humanist education anywhere else, and I don’t think we should deprive people of that opportunity,” he said.

Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber said that the officer who asked H*yas for Choice to move its table from an off-campus sidewalk on 37th and O streets NW on Monday afternoon acted in violation of the university’s speech and expression policy.
H*yas for Choice chose to table that day in silent protest of an event on campus bestowing an honorary degree upon Donald Cardinal Wuerl, the Archbishop of Washington, since the group opposes Wuerl’s opinions on women’s health and LGBTQ rights.
“One of our officers mistakenly asked students to move from 37th and O Streets,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It was a miscommunication. I have apologized to the students.”
H*yas for Choice has previously been allowed to table outside of the front gates. After group members set up a table in Healy Circle during the Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life last January, GUPD relocated them to the same spot on the public sidewalk.
According to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, the administration plans to work with students to ensure that free speech policies are followed in the future.
“I know Chief Gruber has said this was a miscommunication with GUPD and a mistake,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He has apologized. We will continue to work with all members of our university community to ensure our Speech and Expression policies are followed.”
H*yas for Choice President Abby Grace (SFS ’16) said that although Gruber admitted fault, he failed to characterize the type of miscommunication that occurred and thus downplayed the problem.
“Jay Gruber, in his email to us, acknowledged it was public property, so I think that just objectively, they’re correct by saying it was an error,” Grace said. “I think that it is rather regrettable that they framed it as a miscommunication rather than a clear breach in policy, because I think this communication implies that H*yas for Choice was in miscommunication with officers, [when] rather it was officers miscommunicating with each other.”
Grace will attend a Speech and Expression Committee meeting Friday, and said she will tell the story and push for policy enforcement.
“I think that we’re coming to share the facts and discuss what happened. I think that the community itself has a few recommendations lined up,” Grace said. “[We hope for] correct enforcement of the policy. … A policy means nothing if it’s not backed up by actions, so I’m hoping for correct application.”
Georgetown University Student Association President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) will also work with the committee Friday. Olson, Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Jeanne Lord and Director of the Center for Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr will also be in attendance.
“Omika and I are dismayed to learn of the latest confrontation between H*yas for Choice and the GUPD,” Tezel wrote in a statement. “What happened yesterday appears to be a clear violation of the [memorandum of understanding] reached between GUSA leadership and Dr. Olson last semester. We look forward to working with the Speech and Expression Committee to ensure that this is resolved in an appropriate manner.”

After a failure to notify the Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service of previous campus health emergencies, university officials informed the EMT service of the test results confirming a case of bacterial meningitis an hour before emailing the rest of the student body last Thursday.
Last March, however, when then-sophomore Daniel Milzman produced ricin in his dorm room in McCarthy Hall, the university did not inform GERMS prior to informing the rest of the student body.
“We knew about the meningitis as it was happening. There were GERMS members that responded to the meningitis call, knew about the incident earlier than university officials,” GERMS Director of Public Relations Manavi Bhagwat (NHS ’16) said. “We were finding out the information as the university did because for a long time, tests were still coming out as they were trying to test if it was bacterial or not. We found out that it was bacterial about an hour before other students.”
The GERMS crew on duty became aware of the case of possible meningitis before the rest of the university when they received an emergency call last week. Since the group operates [under] the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the members on call were prohibited from informing students or other GERMS members to protect patient confidentiality.
“The university and GERMS communicate on a very regular basis,” GERMS Captain Brian Monahan (COL ’15) said. “As an organization that provides a campus service, we feel that it is important to have regular and productive communication with various university departments who play an important role in managing the day to day operations at Georgetown.”
Despite this regular communication, GERMS officials were not informed about the presence of ricin on campus last March until the university sent out a campus-wide email. Monahan and Bhagwat said they are confident that the university would have informed GERMS had they thought the ricin posed a risk to the health of the student body.
“GERMS leadership at the time of the ricin incident was provided information on a need-to-know basis and at no point was patient or GERMS provider safety in jeopardy,” Monahan said. “Given the circumstances surrounding the incident, GERMS was pleased with how the incident was handled by all involved.”
The lack of communication between the university and GERMS, which is often the first method of care for students, in all medical emergencies creates concerns for some students.
Jason Gusdorf (SFS ’16) said he feels that a communication lapse could create a potential risk for students.
“It concerns me that GERMS doesn’t always have access to certain important general medical information during campus-wide emergencies,” Gusdorf said. “It’s the organization in charge of immediate student medical services and I would like them to be as prepared to help students as possible.”
Alexa DiAngeles (COL ’16) said that she thinks that GERMS should be alerted about serious health issues on campus because they work directly with a large number of students.
“I think they should be allowed to know [about health risks] because if they’re getting calls, they’re in direct contact with students, they’re going to be the ones that can tell if this is spreading,” DiAngeles said. “These are very difficult situations to handle and very unexpected situations.”
Alisha Dua (COL ’16) said that she thinks that it is important for GERMS to know about serious health risks for the sake of its own members.
“I would think they should be the first people to know … for their own sake,” Dua said. “Their chances are way higher that they’d be exposed.”
Although GERMS is not always given a priority notification, the group regularly works closely with the Georgetown Hospital Emergency Department.
In the past week, GERMS has worked with several on-campus departments as well as physicians at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital to create a protocol for treating students with symptoms similar to those of meningitis.
Monahan facilitated additional discussions with the hospital as well as with internal university departments such as Student Health and the Department of Emergency Management to ensure GERMS was prepared to respond to possible outbreaks.
“Georgetown EMS maintains patient and crew safety as our utmost priority,” Monahan said. “The nature of emergency medical services is that they are unexpected and unpredictable. There have been countless times where GERMS has had to modify its normal operations.”
James Welsh, Assistant Vice President for Student Health Services at Georgetown, commended GERMS’s exceptional abilities that have allowed it to implement emergency procedures following this recent campus emergency.
“GERMS is an extremely important organization to our university,” Welsh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “All of us (students, faculty, staff, visitors) rely on their exceptional training, organization, skill and response to ensure the health and safety of our community. We are very lucky to have them.”

The Georgetown University Energy Prize has selected 53 communities to advance to the quarterfinals of its $5 million, privately funded energy prize, which will award one community for its energy efficiency. Among the quarterfinalists are a range of small and medium-sized cities, towns and counties from across the United States, each with a variety of past efficiency experience and goals.
The competition’s goal is to ultimately create a platform for a diversity of innovations and ideas across the United States.
According to GUEP Executive Director Francis Slakey, this project is broad in scope, partially because of the eagerness of each community.
“The enthusiasm in these communities is contagious,” Slakey said. “This is the first time so many governments, utilities and community groups will be working together to reduce energy consumption.”
Since the Georgetown University Program on Science in the Public Interest launched the competition in February, these communities have worked to outline a plan for increasing energy efficiency and generate a leadership team to lead their projects. Additionally, the communities must secure signed commitments from their local governments, as well as electric and natural gas utilities and a community-based organization.
Currently, 16 launch sponsors, primary collaborators and outreach organizations, have committed funding, resources and assistance. Among these groups are the Joyce Foundation, U.S. Department of Energy and AARP, as well as any additional organizations secured by the individual communities. The high level of sponsorship secured by the communities in the quarterfinals exceeded GUEP Project Director Christofer Nelson’s initial expectations.
“I think when we first set out the requirements, we were thinking nonprofit organizations, local environmental groups or maybe even home-owner associations. We got letters from Microsoft, Belview Washington and even New Belgium Brewing to support different communities’ efforts,” Nelson said.
The prize’s sponsors support innovative efforts in participating communities.
The range of diversity within sponsorship, mentorship and participants enhances the array of possible outcomes that will extend beyond community boundaries. One major sponsor, the Joyce Foundation, is based in the Midwest. According to Ed Miller, the foundation’s environmental representative, the foundation is excited to sponsor the prize.
“We are eager to continue to partner with Georgetown University, and we are planning as the prize progresses to help get the word out in the Midwest, whether the winner comes from the Midwest or not,” Miller said.
Although Washington, D.C., does not fit the criteria of a “small to medium community,” 10 Georgetown University students have interned at GUEP’s office. During the summer, one Georgetown student made the discovery that with slightly moderate energy conservation efforts, this competition has the potential to immediately save $1 billion in energy costs and cut millions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions over the course of the next two years.
“It is an example of an idea that’s pretty modest, but one which can really make a difference,” Nelson said. “This competition has really been about leveraging the assets the university has, which is intellectual capita, brilliant students, faculty, as well as a desire to serve our community and make a difference. Truly, the sky is the limit.”
Communities will continue to develop their projects until Jan. 1, when they will compete against each other.
Competing community Farmington Hills, Mich., has continued to assemble its team this fall since submitting their proposal.
“We have a lot of great things going in Farmington Hills. We’ve been doing many sustainability projects over the years, but this time we’re excited to compete with our peers. May the best community win,” Nate Geinzer, assistant to the Farmington Hills city manager, said.
Innovation efforts in Farmington Hills have included water efficiency efforts and an emphasis on alternative transportation, such as public transit and hybrid vehicles.
Nelson said he hopes to recruit Georgetown undergraduate and graduate students to help with the project.
“There is a huge amount of untapped potential here that we haven’t even gotten into because we don’t have the bandwidth,” Nelson said. “There are opportunities for unique graduate student and faculty research. There are opportunities for hands-on learning. There are opportunities for teaching. There are just so many things that can come out of this, [of] which we haven’t even scratched the surface.”

The Georgetown University Student Association hosted its inaugural Multicultural Council Town Hall on Tuesday in the Healey Family Student Center, soliciting suggestions for the council from members of various campus cultural groups.
Representatives of the Multicultural Council, which was created in August to facilitate communication between GUSA and cultural groups on campus, outlined their agenda for the year and invited students to participate in various working groups.
GUSA’s Director of Outreach Eng Gin Moe (SFS ’16) and the GUSA Multicultural Deputy Director of Outreach Rodrigo Gonzalez (SFS ’15) lead the council, which also includes six representatives who are leaders in their respective cultural groups.
“The whole purpose [of the Council] is to develop a constant and direct line of communication between cultural groups and the GUSA executives,” Moe said. “We are institutionalizing a commitment to cultural diversity.”
Gonzalez said that being a part of the council has helped him fulfill a personal goal.
“It stands from the fact that when I came here as a freshman, I immediately gravitated towards the Latino-Hispanic groups on campus. I felt like I was a bit of an outsider there,” Gonzalez said. As a result, he founded the GU Mexican Students Association in his freshman year. “I would be helping other groups with what I did for my own.”
The coordinators outlined the structural makeup of the committee, which consists of four working groups.
The academic working group deals with the creation and integration of multicultural topics into classes; the funding group aims to examine and reform how cultural groups are currently funded; the institutional group works to solve issues with the university including heritage funds; and the programming group helps with cross-collaboration between cultural groups and promoting active multiculturalism.
The council’s meetings will be open to all students and are scheduled to occur biweekly.
Some students in the audience raised concerns about whether or not cross-cultural interactions would actually increase following the creation of the council, while others posed questions about how cultural groups of all sizes would be equally represented by the committee. Moe said many of these issues will be minimized since the council is organized into working groups rather than being structured by cultural groups.
“The working group structure ensures cross-cultural communication, so that the individuals in a cultural group won’t just stick to that group,” Moe said.”One important thing to know in the beginning is that we will all try to support each other equally.”
GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said he has high hopes for the council to resolve issues from previous years resulting from the nonexistence of such a program.
“The idea behind a multicultural council is to advocate to administrators what cultural communities traditionally haven’t had as much access to,” Tezel said.
The committee currently provides a schedule of events on Google Calendar which broadcasts events from all cultural groups so that they are not limited to just the members of a particular group.
Council leaders also discussed various initiatives, such as the creation of alternate funding structures and the autonomy of cultural groups from the Students Activities Commission, the current advisory board under which they are governed. Moe, a previous SAC commissioner, is in favor of a new cultural group advisory board.
“The nature of funding is that there is a limited amount of money for all these great groups that want to do so much,” Moe said. “Cultural groups want to do a lot of great programming, but SAC may not be the right fit for them.”

History professor James Collins, public interest law professor Philip Schrag and the late pharmacology professor Karen Gale will be honored for their dedication to scholarly research and student engagement with the President’s Awards for Distinguished Scholar-Teachers, University President John J. DeGioia announced Friday.
“There are some who believe that research and teaching are in conflict,” Provost Robert Groves said. “We make sure that we honor those among us who do both well simultaneously to note that great researchers can be great teachers.”
The award, which was created last year, provides an annual grant of $10,000 for three academic years to support the scholarship of distinguished professors.
Throughout his 29 years at Georgetown, Collins has taught a wide range of students, including first-years, upper-level graduate students and doctoral candidates, and he said that he enjoys working with students in a small classroom setting.
“My favorite thing about teaching at Georgetown is that I get to teach at multiple levels of the curriculum,” Collins said. “I’ve always taught those classes with a focus on the smaller discussion sections. I prefer the discussion sections because the main thing that we’re trying to teach students to do at Georgetown is how to think, not what to think.”
For Collins, research and teaching are not two separate entities but rather complementary parts of the classroom experience.
“For me, Georgetown pays me a salary and it pays me to teach,” Collins said. “So my first priority is to teach. And to me, scholarship is a natural outgrowth of teaching. Students will always come with a new perspective to those books chosen for class, a perspective that I don’t have, and help me think about not only those texts but also other texts that I’m working on for scholarship.”
Collins said he especially loves to learn from his students, noting poignant memories of teaching students with diverse backgrounds, including adult students who provided first-hand accounts in class from their personal experiences during the Cambodian genocide, Ceausescu’s Romanian government and Nazi occupation.
“This is the advantage of teaching at a place like Georgetown,” Collins said. “There are all kinds of fascinating people here. We are in a city that attracts people from all over the world. And the student body comes from all over the globe.”
Schrag, as the Delaney Family Professor of Public Interest Law and founding director of the Center for Applied Legal Studies, received the award for his innovation in the legal clinical program. Schrag said that his favorite part of teaching is the clinical program, which allows law students to represents clients who are seeking asylum in the United States because they fear persecution in their home countries.
“My students worked with their clients for the entire semester and ended up defending a deportation case against their clients in seeking asylum in a federal immigration court proceeding,” Schrag said.”After preparing them for the entire semester, I’m so proud of these students who are able to handle a four-hour hearing in court by themselves.”
According to Margaret Parker (LAW ’15), who is participating in the clinical program this year, Schrag creates a stronger learning experience by encouraging his students to explore what interests them.
“He really gave us room to make mistakes within the comfort of his supervision,” Parker said. “He didn’t really tell us, ‘You should go there to find this expert or look here.’ He encouraged us to just explore and try things. If we really got off track, he would just lead us back. It was empowering to do things as if we weren’t actually students. We were actually just advocates.”
Gale, who died this August, was honored for her groundbreaking neuroscience research of seizures on the brain and her impactful teaching as the founding director of the Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience.
Pharmacology professor Barry Wolfe, Gale’s colleague of 25 years, said that he remembers the moment when Gale was elected as the director of the program.
“That very time when she learned she was the one elected, she hugged me and broke down and started crying and said, ‘This is my lifetime dream.’ And it was,” Wolfe said.
According to Wolfe, Gale let students take control of their education. She organized three new courses that helped promote students’ professional success.
“What she really did was that she empowered students in a very large way, in a way that most faculty would look at and say, ‘Oh my goodness, students have so much power over the program. How could that be?’” Wolfe said.
Wolfe noted Gale’s dedication to supporting female faculty. Gale often pointed out occasions in which few women were invited as guest speakers for the program, even when the majority of doctoral students were women.
The award grants that Gale would have received will be used to create a Memorial Lecture Fund for Women in Neuroscience.
“Karen was one of the faculty members of the Georgetown Women in Medicine organization. So she was a firm believer in providing education opportunities for women and minority students and to help them succeed,” Gale’s former postdoctoral student, Patrick Forcelli (GRD ’11), said.
Forcelli, who co-nominated her for this award, said that Gale had a multidisciplinary way of teaching that was highly effective.
“One of the things that I love about her is that she had such a wide view in pharmacology,” Forcelli said. “She really could span multiple levels of analysis, from basic pharmacology all the way up to neuroscience. Since neuroscience is inherently multidisciplinary, it’s essential to look at all different levels to really look at how the brain works.”

The Institute of Turkish Studies and the Middle East Institute co-sponsored a panel on Turkey, the Islamic State group and the Middle East on Wednesday in McShain Lounge.
A panel of experts led by Sinan Ciddi, executive director of the Institute for Turkish Studies, included Denise Natali, who holds the Minerva Chair at the Institute for National Strategic Studies at the National Defense University, Kadir Ustun, the research director at the SETA foundation and Mutlu Civiroglu, a journalist whose field of work involves Turkey and Syria.
The group discussed Turkey’s relationship to the turmoil between the Islamic State group and the Kurds in Iraq. Turkey finds itself at a nexus, with its status as a geographic neighbor to the conflict and a key NATO ally of the United States, which recently began airstrikes against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq.
“Turkey is expected to play an important role in [world events],” Director of the Middle East Institute’s Center for Turkish Studies Gonul Tol said. “A few days ago, it was signaled that Turkey might become part of the military coalition. Now there is a huge debate on what exactly [they] will do.”
Ciddi said that the panel discussion was meant to help elucidate the current events in the region during a time of decision-making.
“It is a timely topic, we think, because of Turkey’s proposed role for what is happening in northern Syria and Iraq with the spread of the ISIS threat,” Ciddi said. “[This panel is designed to] shed light on some of the most urgent questions that are being asked.”
The discussion began with remarks from each speaker, with Natali beginning by examining the divide between the Kurdish people. Natali said she is unsure if regional Kurdish groups such as the Kurdish Regional Government and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, also known as PKK, can work together to fight a common enemy.
“I actually am pretty skeptical even about how far this so-called alliance, if you even want to call it that, between the KRG … and the PKK can go,” Natali said. “[They are] in direct competition with each other. That competition still exists today. … The extent to which this competition for leadership of the Kurds and to direct the nature of the Kurdish nationalism should be taken into account, because that did not change after [the Islamic State’s rise].”
Ustun said that allies around the world need to develop a unified plan to aid the Kurds and put an end to the violence in the area.
“The U.S. and the allies including Turkey have failed to find a common strategy … to support the Syrian opposition and create credible alternatives to the Assad regime,” Ustun said. “The chaos and vacuum created by the civil war in the past few years have created a breeding ground for terrorist organizations.”
According to Utsun, the current United States strategy suffers from “bomb-and-walk-away syndrome,” a tendency to intervene militarily in a country and then not follow up with aid or infrastructure improvements.
“There is no actual political goal or political strategy defined, at least what we can see publically by the U.S. that will resolve the issues on the ground,” Utsun said.
The panelists’ initial speeches were followed by a question-and-answer session, during which the panel fielded questions about decision-making in Turkey, Iran’s involvement and the Turkish position.
Deniz Citak (SFS ’17), who attended the event, said that he found the discussion to be both fascinating and informative.
“I studied Persian and I’m really interested in the Middle East and I’ve studied some Arabic, so obviously ISIS and the Middle East are going to be topics [I’m concerned with] and I think Turkey is real interesting,” he said.
Citak, who is half Turkish, was intrigued by the topic.
“Currently, our government’s a little unsure of what to do with the question of ISIS and Turkey despite its proximity has been very hesitant … and I guess that was because of the hostages who are now out, so we’ll see,” Citak said.

Contrary to the nationwide trend of declining donations from recent graduates, Georgetown University has seen increased participation from young alumni, allowing the university to sustain its master planning projects.
The Chronicle for Higher Education reported earlier this month that a study of donors found that fewer than half of millennial alumni had ever given back to their university, with 75 percent stating that they would give to another organization before their alma mater.
Vanessa Otarola Kehoe (NHS ’08), senior director of Class Programs and Reunion Campaigns at the Office of Advancement, found the findings of the study odd.
“With our young alumni, we have actually seen a different trend,” Kehoe wrote in an email.
At Georgetown, 33 percent of alumni who had graduated in the past five years donated to the University in 2014 alone, an increase from 26 percent in 2010. Additionally, the rate of young alumni donations was the same as for the general alumni population, 33 percent of whom also donated in 2014.
Kehoe explained that each class has a committee in charge of keeping alumni connected within the class and with the university, which she credited with the improved rates.
“In the past few years, committee members have directly asked their classmates to donate to Georgetown, which has been incredibly impactful,” she wrote. “Furthermore, the Office of Advancement has gotten more creative with giving communications (and e-communications) and has been improving the online giving experience in an attempt to make giving easier and faster.”
Tyler Newhall (COL ’15), last year’s president of the 1634 Society, which focuses on promoting alumni giving and fostering connections between students and graduates, also pointed to efforts aimed at encouraging students to give back during their time at Georgetown. He cited the annual marquee event, the One for Georgetown campaign, during which the 1634 Society aims to see a $1 donation from 50 percent of the freshman class.
“The one dollar is really a symbolic thing. … But the idea is, we want to get people into the spirit of saying, ‘I want to give back to Georgetown,’ even if it’s a small amount,” Newhall said.
Georgetown announced earlier this year that it had raised $1.2 billion as part of its 10-year For Generations to Come campaign, which has a goal of $1.5 billion to fund scholarships and construction projects across the university. The campaign is expected to run until July 2016.
Newhall emphasized the importance of donations in contributing to the future of the university for alumni.
“There’s so much construction and master planning going on, it’s important to plan for the future. That means … making sure the Georgetown experience, making sure our degree means as much as, if not more than, what it did when we graduated,” he said.
Though the construction projects scattered across campus require significant funding, Kehoe noted that recent alumni tend to prioritize scholarship programs over construction projects, as 65 percent of young graduates gave to scholarship programs last year.
“Young alumni seem to be more interested in supporting scholarship, and we always encourage alumni to donate where their hearts leads them,” Kehoe wrote.
Even with the positive trend at Georgetown, the Chronicle pointed to the significant burden of student loans, which affect 37 percent of households headed by individuals under 40, as limiting donations.
Acknowledging the difficult economic situation, Newhall encouraged alumni to give back in other ways than financial donations.
“The 1634 Society is not a fundraising group. Even the money we collect is more of a symbolic thing. We deal more in getting alumni and current students to give back in other ways, giving their time, giving their experience to students,” he said. “[That is] one thing that we really like to stress, coming back and giving whatever you can, whether that’s time, whether that’s sharing your wealth of experience.”
Hannah Merrill (COL ’18) agreed with Newhall, seeing donations as a chance to give back.
“I would want to give back to the university because I think that would be my way of helping them improve their educational facilities that gave me a lot while I was here,” she said.

Uber, the popular ridesharing service, announced its “Ride for a Cause” charity initiative Sept. 19, partnering with five D.C. area charities to donate $1 for every ride through Sept. 28.
“Uber has always been committed to giving back to the communities we serve,” Uber spokesperson Taylor Bennett said. “We’re constantly exploring new ways to provide even greater value to our partners and a better experience to our riders.”
At the end of each ride, passengers can choose one of the five charities to receive the donation from Uber. In addition to the $1 per ride option, every person who refers a friend to Uber will have $2 donated to the charity of his or her choice. When the program ends, the charity with the most selections will unlock an additional $10,000 donation.
The five participating charities are Best Buddies, Fight for Children, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, National Park Foundation and So Others Might Eat.
Bennett explained that Uber aimed to partner with diverse charities for the initiative, in order to offer customers a variety of donation options.
“We chose both local and national charities that advocate for a range of causes,” he said. “Best Buddies, Fight for Children, IAVA, National Park Foundation and So Others Might Eat are all fantastic charities with wonderful missions.”
According to Bennett, Ride for a Cause has already raised thousands of dollars.
SOME spokesman Tracy Jefferson said that the money from Uber will go toward assisting the children cared for by the charity.
“Each dollar that we raise will be directed to providing nutritious snacks for kids in our after-school program,” Jefferson said.
Fight for Children, a nonprofit organization focused on providing D.C. children with better quality education, will put the money towards Joe’s Champs, the wing of the organization focusing on preschool quality in high-need neighborhoods.
“We’re a well-known brand with a strong social media presence, and I think we have a good program and a message to promote,” Fight for Children External Relations Director Jeff Travers said.
This is not Uber’s first charity effort in the D.C. area. Last November, Uber offered free rides to and from community partners as an opportunity for riders to donate or volunteer without having to pay for transportation. In December, Uber donated $1 toward gifts for D.C. families in need for every UberBLACK user who took a ride on Dec. 16.
Travers noted that corporate partnerships with charities were increasing.
“I’ve been working in nonprofits my whole life,” he said. “More and more, companies are looking to help charities and market their brand.”
Recently, Uber has faced pushback from city councils across the country and received a cease-and-desist letter from the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles in June regarding concerns over its regulatory status.
The D.C. Taxicab Commission has also called for increased regulation of the ride-sharing service, which is not registered with the DCTC.
“We would much prefer that Uber operate within the regulatory system as opposed to outside of it,” DCTC spokesperson Neville Waters said. “Our job is public safety and consumer protection, so in order to perform our duties it would be critical to know who is driving and what kind of vehicles are on the road.”
Jefferson, however, praised Uber for its charity initiative.
“We’re happy to be a part of the initiative and excited about possibly working with Uber moving forward,” Jefferson said.
Students were appreciative of Uber’s charity efforts, though Dan Akselrod (SFS ’18), a frequent user of the service, was skeptical that it would affect the company’s ridership.
“I think it’s great that Uber is using their growing popularity to contribute to charitable causes,” he said. “However, I do not think that this one initiative will encourage people to use Uber. If people care about the charities, they will just continue to support them in ways they already have.”
Jim Nealon (MSB ’16) thought the initiative was a good way for community members to give back, though he hoped it would be a starting point for further volunteerism.
“Considering how quickly Uber has expanded and how many college students use the service on a regular basis, I think this is a great idea,” Nealon said. “Of course, this campaign should not be a substitute for participating in actual volunteer service. However, I think this is a small thing that can get people in our community involved and talking about how we can better serve the D.C. community.”

Tom, 
It is truly great and rewarding what you have done. I have been trying for the past (8) months to get in touch with someone @ Uber to help us sponsor a walk with Beverly Hills Police Department to raise awareness for drunk drivers. 
Please let me know who to call or email.
I appreciate any help in this matter.
