Four tickets launched their campaigns for the 2018 Georgetown University Student Association executive election early Thursday morning, previewing a season expected to focus on themes of affordability and inclusion.
The announced tickets are: Logan Arkema (COL ’20) and Jonathan Compo (COL ’20), Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) and Richard Howell (SFS ’19), Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) and Naba Rahman (SFS ’19), and Josh Sirois (SFS ’20) and Casey Doherty (COL ’20).
Per tradition, Estes and Howell, Nair and Rahman and Sirois and Doherty walked into Red Square just after midnight to mark the start of the official campaign period. Arkema and Compo arrived in Red Square later.
The tickets are joined by a fifth evidently satirical candidate, a member of the Georgetown Heckler satirical publication who launched an unofficial write-in campaign as Jesus with the running mate “You.”
Tickets can still join the race by collecting and submitting 100 student signatures to the GUSA Election Commission by Feb. 10. Election day is set for Feb. 22.
Arkema and Compo
Capes flowing in the wind and bat signals alight, Arkema and Compo ran through Red Square dressed as superhero duo Batman and Robin, calling for the replacement of the Georgetown University Police Department with vigilantes and renaming the second floor of Lauinger Library to “Arkham Asylum.” Their call for “pocket bat-signals for everyone” elicited cheers from the dwindling crowd.
Arkema is the Georgetown University College Democrats’ membership director and a GUSA senator for West Campus, which includes Southwest Quad. Arkema campaigned for his senate seat on a promise to conduct all GUSA business in the character and voice of the cartoon hero Batman, a persona he plans to maintain in the GUSA executive campaign.
Arkema was joined by his running mate Compo, technical director for Mask and Bauble Dramatic Society’s “Footloose” musical production this spring and a former cartoonist for The Hoya.
Donning a full Robin suit, Compo acted as a dutiful sidekick to his Batman counterpart. The two are running a satirical campaign, aimed at highlighting perceived faults in past and current GUSA campaigns.
“I believe we are trying to go for healthy and nuanced satire that overall improves Georgetown and GUSA,” Arkema said. “And we’re going to solve every single one of our problems that GUSA faces in costume, because we definitely believe that two individual people can completely change everything at Georgetown in a single year.”
Despite their satirical approach to the campaign, the superhero duo touted GUSA’s potential for achievement.
“GUSA can be effective if people focus on the issues, rather than themselves. I think if they take themselves a little less seriously, then maybe we can make student government a fun place to get s–t done,” Arkema said.
Estes and Howell
After leading supporters in a rendition of the university’s traditional fight song, “There Goes Old Georgetown,” Estes and Howell unveiled a platform distinct among the campaigns for its emphasis on community and values.
Estes served on the GUSA senate’s Finance and Appropriations Committee during his sophomore year and previously directed membership for Georgetown University College Republicans in 2016. Estes has also served as the head of the Georgetown chapter of the Knights of Columbus, the world’s largest Catholic service fraternal organization.
Howell is also a member of the Knights of Columbus and serves on the associate board of the Lecture Fund.
Estes and Howell’s campaign is built on three themes: cost, community and charity.
Estes said his and Howell’s personal experiences struggling to meet Georgetown’s tuition and living costs inspired the cost theme of their campaign.
“We’re both here on scholarships, we’re here on financial aid, I’m working two jobs just to support my time at Georgetown, and it’s becoming harder and harder to do that,” Estes said. “And so we want to approach ways to reduce fees, make campus more affordable and take a look at tuition and the tuition transparency process so we can have a real process with the administration.”
Estes and Howell’s second and third campaign themes, community and charity, stand out as priorities based in the student body’s culture rather than university policy. The community pillar reflects the candidates’ concern that today’s student body shares too few common experiences.
“The community used to be be built around the basketball team and that’s just not possible these days,” Estes said. “I just don’t think there’s enough communal experiences that we come out of Georgetown saying you know this is what binds us together.”
The final pillar of their campaign, charity, represents Estes and Howell’s hope to build a “culture of service” by promoting service projects on campus.
“This is a school that’s founded on the formation of the individual, building individuals to go out in the world and serve the world,” Estes said. “What we would like to see is potentially a service pledge, where all clubs seek to participate and at least once a year host a service project. I think that’s a great way to bring the resources Georgetown has to a larger community.”
Nair and Rahman
A group of supporters rallied around Nair and Rahman while they launched their campaign, which seeks to amplify student voices on campus and strengthen Georgetown’s existing resources. The pair intends to run on a platform of inclusivity, accountability and opportunity on campus.
Nair said those three tenets will guide them in their approach to the election and policy issues.
“We want to build a GUSA that is by Georgetown and for Georgetown, as opposed to by GUSA and for GUSA,” Nair said. “We want to amplify the voices of communities on this campus that aren’t represented within our student government right now.”
Nair is director of external outreach at Innovo Consulting, a group that connects social entrepreneurs and nonprofit organizations to Georgetown students. Rahman led Model United Nations’ National Collegiate Security Conference last semester and has been involved with Georgetown University Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, a $1.5 million student-run fund that allocates grant money to student and alumni social ventures.
Nair and Rahman would seek to promote student projects and ideas by connecting students with existing resources on campus and bolstering relationships between students and administrators. Rahman said she believes GUSA has untapped potential to support students in their pursuits.
“A lot of students out there have these big dreams and big goals and a lot of times they fall short. I think a lot of the reason is that they don’t have the support to get there,” Rahman said. “I think GUSA is an amazing institution that has the opportunity to reach those students, but right now it’s not really reaching out and serving the community there.”
It’s time to change the way things work, Rahman said.
“I think that this is an opportunity for us to shift the table. Right now, students have to come to GUSA for help and GUSA has to stand up and start going to them, asking what they want and what they need,” Rahman said.
GUSA’s election history of low voter turnout and lack of student engagement has motivated Nair to try to connect with a broader range of students across campus.
“We’re looking forward to getting Georgetown, as a community and as a school, excited about GUSA elections,” Nair said. “I have a good feel for this campus and I want to really reach out and bring people into these conversations and make this GUSA election the best election.”
Sirois and Doherty
Sirois and Doherty brought along a large throng of campaign staff and supporters, launching their campaign with a performance by campus a cappella group Georgetown Superfood, their first endorser.
Sirois and Doherty pitched themselves as a ticket of continuity; they plan to continue the work they, individually, and GUSA, broadly, began under the current administration.
“We really want to show that we’ve done a lot of work with the current GUSA executive, and we do see things that could be done better and we’re absolutely reflecting those in our platform that we’re not trying to revolutionize the system,” Sirois said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’re trying to take the progress that’s been made and make it more, make it better.”
Sirois is a GUSA senator who has served on the Finance and Appropriations Committee, the senate body that appropriates the Student Activities Fee to student groups, while Doherty has led GUSA’s “Dreamers” advocacy efforts on the Federal and D.C. Relations committee and is a coordinator for Georgetown Opportunities for Leadership Development.
Sirois cited his campaign’s commitment to advancing existing efforts within GUSA, including a previously unannounced initiative to establish a food pantry. They also proposed a new body within the GUSA executive, the Hoya Hotline, which would seek out and respond to student questions and concerns, including connecting students with existing resources.
Sirois and Doherty are focusing on three policy pillars: affordability and access, student empowerment, and health and wellness.
One of Sirois and Doherty’s potential vulnerabilities as candidates is their school year, as both are sophomores. The current GUSA president, Kamar Mack (COL ’19), was the only sophomore to run for the GUSA executive in 2017, while the 2016 and 2015 GUSA races included no sophomore candidates.
Sirois said the pair’s school year is not a weakness and said the ticket sees it as an “absolute advantage.”
“We know some other candidates are entering their senior year; we know some candidates are planning to spend their summers elsewhere. We both are committed to spending our summers here actively,” Sirois said. “We’re at the point in our careers in the student body where it makes sense. … In Georgetown’s student environment, leadership really doesn’t have to be just in our junior and senior years, and I think we can really prove that.”
The Road Ahead
The debates for vice presidential and presidential candidates will be held in Intercultural Center Room 115 on Feb. 14 and in the Healey Family Student Center’s Great Room on Feb. 19, respectively.
Tickets are barred from spending more than $300 on their campaigns. They are required to submit receipts of all campaign expenses by midnight on election day.
On election day, students can vote on the student organization portal Hoya Link or at a polling station operated by the GUSA Election Commission, expected to be located either in Red Square, weather permitting, or the Leavey Center.
In addition to the race for GUSA president and vice president, the February ballot will also include a referendum, approved by the GUSA senate Jan. 21, which proposes reforms to the senate’s current structure. The reforms include electing senators by class year rather than geographical district and holding elections for nonfreshman senators in the spring instead of in the fall.

Two Georgetown alumni — a 26-year-old White House adviser under former President Barack Obama and an Army veteran-turned-Lutheran pastor — are duking it out for the Democratic nomination for Congress in the 4th district of Pennsylvania.
Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson (SFS ’14) and George Scott (SFS ’84) are both campaigning for their party’s nomination to face the Republican incumbent, Rep. Scott Perry, in the 2018 midterm elections. Corbin-Johnson formerly worked as an assistant and adviser to the director of the Office of Management and Budget during the Obama administration, while Scott is a veteran of the U.S. Army and a Lutheran pastor.
The district is 85 percent white with a median household income of $59,226, above the national average of $55,322, according to 2016 data from the American Community Survey. Just over a third of adults over 25 years old in the district have a college degree, below the national average of 39 percent.
The district voted decisively for President Donald Trump in the 2016 election over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton: Trump carried 59 percent of support to Clinton’s 37 percent. Perry, the incumbent Republican representative, was re-elected in 2016 by a two-to-one margin.
Ahead of their May 15 primary election, The Hoya interviewed Corbin-Johnson and Scott about their campaign platforms, their reasons for running and how their Georgetown education helped drive their interest in public service.

If elected, Johnson, 26, would be the youngest woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress and the first African-American woman to represent the 4th District.
Johnson’s first exposure to politics began in her grandparents’ household. After growing up during the era of segregation and receiving limited education, her grandparents stressed the importance of participating in national politics. From the moment that she turned 18, Johnson felt an obligation to take an active role in politics.
“Going from a foster house to the White House was something I never expected,” Johnson said. “You don’t really see that in your life when you’re sharing one bed with three different girls, and now, you’re the right hand to the guy in charge of $4.1 trillion.”

Scott spent much of his life serving in the armed forces. After completing one year at the U.S. Air Force Academy, he transferred to Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service, where he continued his military involvement through the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program. Scott served in the U.S. Army until his retirement in 2004 and continued to work in national security with the CIA until 2009, when he became a Lutheran pastor.
Scott said he would like to see more bipartisanship in Congress. He referred to the Republican tax reform bill, passed Dec. 20 on a party-line vote, as an example of failed bipartisanship and a departure from normal legislative process.
“When we depart from that regular order, into — like take the tax bill, no committee hearings, no real inclusion of the Democratic Party; it was strictly the Republican Party that formulated that legislation,” Scott said. “Those are not regular order, and when you don’t follow the process, you end up with policy that is fundamentally flawed.”

Advances in banking technology will drive the future of the financial industry, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said during an event at the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business on Tuesday evening.
Corbat covered a range of topics at the event, including the state of the financial industry, the industry’s future and what students should be doing to prepare themselves for careers in finance. Paul Almeida, dean of the McDonough School of Business, moderated the conversation.
The event was part of the MSB’s Stanton Distinguished Leaders Series, a lecture series aimed at bringing business and global leaders to campus to speak about the nature of leadership in their fields.
Among the topics Corbat discussed was the current instability of financial markets. Just a day before the conversation, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 1,600 points, the largest single-day drop since June 2016, though it had recovered somewhat in the time since.
Nevertheless, Corbat said he was happy with the market, viewing the recent drop as a necessary reminder to investors that markets sometimes fall, but they are also very capable of recovering.
“What I think is very positive about the last 36 hours is it’s a great reminder that things do go down,” Corbat said. “Financial markets tend to have short memories. I think it’s a great correction.”
Corbat also emphasized the generally positive long-term trend in financial markets, despite the recent drop.
“You go back and look at the Dow; year over year it’s still up 20 percent,” Corbat said.
Corbat also addressed the changing nature of banking and the financial industry, particularly with recent technological advancements.
“Technology — it’s very easy to see — is changing the face of everything we do,” Corbat said. “When I really look at the application of technology today, it’s really being driven and truly benefitting our customers and clients’ lives.”
Corbat also addressed the positive effects of technology in the financial industry, especially the future of banking for Georgetown students hoping to enter the financial industry and the 58 students joining Citigroup after graduation this year.
“I will say to the 58 Hoyas who are joining us: There is not a more interesting time to be in banking, because right now, we’re just at the start of truly rewriting the next chapter of banking, and technology is going to dominate that story,” Corbat said.
Adam Shinbrot (COL ’18), one of the 58 students planning to work at Citigroup after graduation this year and an attendee of the event, emphasized how technology will continue to transform the banking industry.
“It’s not just about how technology allows you to bank, it’s about how technology allows you to better interact with your customers, and that is going to be very influential as banking goes forward,” Shinbrot said.
Corbat also addressed possible disruptions to the financial industry moving forward, stressing that problems would likely be driven by “geopolitical challenges” rather than challenges stemming from the financial system, as they have in the past.
However, Corbat also emphasized that past political problems had largely not affected the positive trends of financial markets in the United States and that overreactions to potential geopolitical problems are dangerous.
“We’ve just come out of a year where we had 12 uninterrupted months of month-over-month gains: the first time I believe in the history of the stock market,” Corbat said. “That happened against a backdrop of some pretty interesting things in North Korea, some challenges in the Middle East, some questions in the U.S.”
Andrew Kaplan (SFS ’21), who attended the event, said Corbat’s emphasis on the possible disruptions to the economy resonated with him.
“It was really interesting that [Corbat] thinks the next downturn in the economic-business cycle will be based on a geopolitical event of some kind,” Kaplan said. “There are so many indicators in the economy that indicate that earnings are good, wages are fine, world economies are optimistic, but … it could actually be a geopolitical crisis that switches things.”
Corbat ended his talk with advice to Georgetown students looking to enter the financial industry, highlighting the importance of being open to a change in career goals.
“You probably have very specific things or very specific jobs that you ultimately want to get to,” Corbat said. “Fight that urge for now. Whether you’re undergrad or graduate, build your foundation, because your life and your career will very naturally narrow, and those of you that have the best foundation will have the most flexibility in your careers.”

A Georgetown School of Foreign Service professor who has come under fire for allegedly calling a German police officer a “Nazi” is denying German officials’ accusations.
Christine Fair denies a German police report’s accusation that she called a German police officer “Nazi Police” at Frankfurt airport in Germany on Jan. 11.
The alleged confrontation occurred after an airport security agent pulled Fair aside and summoned a German police officer, as required by German law, after an X-ray machine at a security checkpoint indicated her luggage might contain explosives.
According to a German police report, after determining Fair’s bag did not contain explosives, police found loose cosmetics that were not packed according to EU regulations and liquids that exceeded the permitted amount. After the police suggested Fair store a roll-on deodorant in her carry-on bag, the police report states Fair reacted aggressively and called the police “f–king bastards” and “f–king Nazi police.”
Witnesses corroborate the account, the police report said.
Fair’s account differs from that of the police report. She denies the allegations about her comments regarding the German police officer, citing her respect for authority despite her belief that the policeman and the airport security agent were corrupt.
“The whole thing was a straight up shakedown. At the end of the day, this officer just did not want a customer service complaint. If I were a white guy, this wouldn’t be happening to me. For example, the cop called me a hippie. Why am I of all people derided as a hippie?”  Fair said.
Fair claims she was held for roughly 2½ hours by the policeman and the baggage attendant, who she said perjured himself to support the allegations made by the policeman.
Fair told the policeman she would have rather been taken to jail and go before a judge, who she believed would dismiss the allegations against her. The policeman instead charged her what was later described as “bail,” according to The Washington Post.
The report says Fair was charged a $260 fee for legal costs, as determined by a public prosecutor. However, Fair alleges that the policeman arbitrarily took $260 from her wallet as a fee for her conduct, leaving her with $40 out of what the policeman called “generosity.”
“He literally told me to pull my wallet, and then he told me to take my money out of my wallet and arranged the bills by denomination and then took what he wanted,” Fair said.
Fair was also accused of saying the man behind her in line had a “Hitler Youth haircut,” a statement that she agrees to having said. This comment comes after having had numerous altercations with people Fair has described as “American Nazis.” Last spring, Fair confronted white nationalist Richard Spencer and played a role in the a local gym’s termination of his membership.
Fair was brought to a police station where local German police launched a preliminary investigation in response to the defamation charges, according to a Jan. 19 .
The police refused to view the video tape of the airport interaction while she was in custody, Fair said. When she told the policeman that she wanted to file a complaint about him, he threatened her with arrest.
“He’s not a Nazi. He’s just an abusive cop,” Fair said.
Rachel Pugh, Georgetown’s senior director for strategic communications, said faculty have a right to freedom of speech and expression.
“The views of faculty members expressed in their private capacities are their own and not the views of the University,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While Georgetown is committed to free speech and expression, we do not approve of or endorse every statement made by our faculty members. We are also deeply committed to the safety, security, and wellbeing of each member of our community.”
Fair said this event has altered her perspective on travelling abroad.
“I’m still a bit gun shy about going to an airport,” Fair said. “I don’t ever want to be on the inside of a police station again. I felt like they could have done anything to me, and I didn’t know when this was going to end and that was just a scary place to be.”
After Fair was released, she was allowed to continue on her trip to Istanbul. She published several tweets in which she said she was robbed by a German police officer and insulted the German police, according to the German police report.
In response to the controversy, Fair wrote an article published by the Huffington Post in which she described her account of the incident in detail.
Fair says she was sent photos of a German newspaper and multiple links to press releases that published her picture and full name in the report of the incident, which Fair considers a direct violation of the German press code, which recommends that an alleged criminal’s full name only be published under certain circumstances.

Wait, is this the Christine Fair who directed vulgar harassment at a Muslim woman — and former colleague — merely for disagreeing with her politically?  She is calling someone a Nazi?

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced the achievement of two safety milestones last week, satisfying the National Transportation Safety Board’s recommendations in response to a 2009 crash and reducing total crimes levels to the lowest since 2005.
The recommendations that the NTSB officially completed this week included removing and replacing the 1000-series railcars, creating tunnel ventilation procedures for employees in case of fire and implementing better training for employees on how to mitigate the effects of a fire. The NTSB still maintains 26 other open recommendations, including 12 that WMATA has claimed to have already addressed.
The first closed recommendation came in response to a 2009 crash when two Metro railcars collided on the Red line because of a faulty track circuit. Nine people died and 80 were injured in the crash, the deadliest incident in Metro history. In response, the NTSB required WMATA to develop new safety measures, including replacing track circuit modules and developing a safety-issue reporting program for employees. The replacement of old 1000-series cars with new and more secure 7000-series trains was the last open recommendation regarding the crash that WMATA addressed.
The third and fourth recommendations closed by the NTSB last week were initially put in place in response to a 2015 L’Enfant Plaza incident, in which one passenger died and 84 people were hospitalized because of heavy smoke filling a train after an electrical malfunction.
These changes are the result of commitment to customer safety and satisfaction, WMATA General Manager Paul Wiedefeld said in a Feb. 2 news release.
“The closure of this recommendation is the result of the Board’s investment in 7000-series railcars and reflects nearly eight years of hard work and commitment from many staff members throughout the organization,” Wiedefeld said. “We are committed to improving safety and continue to work to address all remaining NTSB safety recommendations.”
WMATA also touted the $1.16  billion it has spent in the last fiscal year to improve the safety of its lines.
“Metro expects to invest another $1.25 billion in capital during fiscal year 2018, including a new preventive maintenance program to improve the safety and reliability of track infrastructure,” the news release read.
The transit company also announced a recent decrease in crime rates on the Metro system. The agency announced crime had fallen to its lowest levels since 2005 in a Feb. 1 news release. There were 1,282 major crimes reported in 2017 on WMATA property — 19 percent less incidents than in 2016.
Metro noted that levels of aggravated assault, motor vehicle theft and rape were down by 27 percent, 45 percent and 67 percent, respectively. Furthermore, there were no homicides, arsons or burglaries in 2017.
Metro Transit Police Chief Ronald Pavlik said in the Feb. 1 news release that Metro would continue to make safety improvements to help its customers.
“I want to commend every member of the Metro Transit Police Department for their hard work throughout the year to achieve these results,” Pavlik said. “I also want to thank our customers and employees for being alert, taking steps to protect their valuables, and reporting suspicious activity or unattended items they encounter.”
Despite these overall improvements, WMATA continues to face significant problems. Average weekday rail ridership is only 612,000, the lowest it has been since 2001. There has been a 10 percent increase in fires on the Metro since August 2017.
Additionally, a Red line train derailment last month caused inspectors to express concerns over the quality and reliability of Metro’s radio system after police officers and the train operator were unable to communicate after the crash because of a faulty radio. WMATA Board Chairman Jack Evans told WTOP on Feb. 2 that this issue and others would be addressed.
“All of this is going to enhance our ability to communicate 100 percent,” Evans said. “We’re buying the new radios, fixing the system, doing everything that’s necessary to make it 100 percent reliable.”

Catholic Charities D.C., the social ministry outreach of the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., provided free dental and medical screenings to community members at its Susan Denison Mona Center for Health and Wellness, located in Temple Hills, Md., on Feb. 6.
The center provided medical and dental screenings, as well as a number of other opportunities for patients to receive social and legal assistance.
The screenings were intended to provide health services to individuals in the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia community who may not otherwise be able to afford or access adequate health care, according to Joseph Dempsey, director of stewardship for Catholic Charities.
“The biggest goal for us is to serve as many of the materially poor as we can in that region,” Dempsey said in an interview with The Hoya. “We will care for everybody. It doesn’t matter what religion or race. Anybody that comes in that needs our help, we will try to help.”
Following the dental screening, patients were given the opportunity to book a follow-up appointment at the clinic to continue attending to their oral health care. According to Dempsey, 31 of the 32 recipients of the free oral screening booked a future appointment.
Attendees of the screenings were offered opportunities to speak with volunteers from the Catholic Charities’ legal network, which provides legal information to clients and refers them to attorneys for pro bono assistance in civil law matters, such as landlord-tenant disputes.
Catholic Charities also offered legal services to assist clients with the immigration process. A representative from the Catholic Charities’ Financial Stability Network, which primarily helps clients with their taxes, was also present.
Opened in October 2017 by Catholic Charities in conjunction with the Maryland Center for Health Equity and Doctors Community Hospital, the Mona Center is home to a dental clinic, a primary care clinic and pro bono legal and immigration services.
Catholic Charities hosted its first dental screenings at the Mona Center in the second week of January. Because of its success, the organization planned the second set of screenings, which expanded to include medical, legal and financial service opportunities.
One aspect the organization improved on from the first screening was reaching out to a larger audience through broader communication strategies, Dempsey said.
“When we did it for the first time in January, we did it on a more compressed time frame,” Dempsey said. “We got the word out as best as we can. I think we did a better job getting the message out on the website and via social media — the word got out in a more timely manner and to more people.”
According to Dempsey, it is unlikely the organization will host another round of screenings soon. However, Catholic Charities will use a mobile response vehicle to provide additional dental screenings and services in the region, according to Senior Manager of Media Relations for Catholic Charities Alexandra Schauffler.
“They provide their mobile disaster vehicle once a month for various uses — it can be used to provide meals or to carry necessities to areas that need relief,” Schauffler said. “We’re actually using it for another dental screening in southern Maryland.”
