Members of the Georgetown University community, including students and administrators, are urging the return of Victor Liu (COL ’21), along with his mother and sister, who have all been prohibited by Chinese authorities from leaving the country since June.
Victor Liu and his sister Cynthia Liu joined their mother Sandra Han on a visit to China to see their unwell grandfather in June 2018. Shortly after the family’s arrival, Chinese authorities separated Han from her children and placed her in a black jail, a secret detention facility in China. 
The siblings are being prevented from leaving China in an effort to persuade their father, who is accused of financial crimes, to surrender to Chinese law enforcement, according to The New York Times. The Liu siblings were not detained but are not permitted to leave the country, The New York Times reported.
Georgetown University has contacted the U.S. Department of State, the Chinese foreign ministry, the Lius’ congressional representatives, the U.S. ambassador to China and the Chinese ambassador to the United States about Victor Liu’s inability to return to the United States, according to Georgetown University spokesperson Matt Hill.
“We have intervened on Victor Liu’s behalf with American and Chinese government officials,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown University is deeply committed to Victor’s safe return home and will continue to advocate for his case.” 
University President John J. DeGioia also visited the Liu siblings in Beijing when he travelled to Asia as part of a Georgetown delegation in November. Evan Medeiros, distinguished fellow in U.S.-China studies who formerly served as special assistant to former President Barack Obama and senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, joined DeGioia on the trip. Medeiros was involved in negotiating the releases of U.S. hostages in North Korea during the Obama administration.  
Dean of the School of Foreign Service Joel Hellman advocated for the release of the Liu siblings in a tweet early Thursday morning.
“We call for the lifting of the exit ban from China for @Georgetown student and US citizen Victor Liu & his sister Cynthia,” the tweet reads. 
Before being prohibited from exiting China, Victor Liu had been planning to start his sophomore year at Georgetown, and Cynthia Liu was set to start working at McKinsey & Company in the fall.
Liu Changming, the siblings’ father, stands accused of participating in a $1.4 billion lending fraud at a Chinese state-owned bank, which came under investigation in 2007. Neither Han nor the siblings have been charged with any official crimes. 
Their father cut ties with his family in 2012, according to The New York Times. Chinese officials are attempting to leverage the family to coerce their father to return to China, according to a letter Cynthia Liu wrote to national security adviser John Bolton obtained by The New York Times.
“We are being held here as a crude form of human collateral to induce someone with whom I have no contact to return to China for reasons with which I am entirely unfamiliar,” Cynthia Liu wrote. 
The Chinese foreign ministry defended the detention of Han and the decision to bar the Liu siblings from leaving, citing their status as Chinese citizens.
“The people you mentioned own legal and valid identity documents as Chinese citizens,” the Chinese foreign ministry told The New York Times.
However, China does not recognize dual nationalities and revokes Chinese citizenship upon gaining a foreign citizenship; Han and the Liu siblings all hold U.S. citizenship. Born in California, Victor Liu is one of few individuals on whom China has placed an exit ban born outside of its borders.
The Liu siblings’ situation has attracted the attention of national policymakers, including Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), who is paying close attention to the status of Han and her children, according to a Nov. 27 tweet. 
“My office is aware of Victor’s, Cynthia’s, and Sandra’s situations and is deeply concerned,” the tweet said. “We are working to secure their safe return and continue to be in touch with U.S. officials to ensure a positive outcome.” 
The U.S. State Department has previously expressed opposition to the Chinese government’s use of exit bans to hold U.S. citizens. The State Department issued a travel advisory in January, warning that U.S. travellers may find themselves subject to guidelines imposed by the Chinese government, according to The New York Times. 
The State Department remains in regular contact with the Liu siblings to ensure consular services are available to the siblings, a State Department official wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“The safety and security of American citizens is a top priority for the Department of State,” the official wrote. “We routinely have shared our concern about China’s use of exit bans on American citizens with the Chinese government and will continue to do so until we see a transparent and fair process.” 
The Office of Endowment, where Victor Liu worked on campus, wish to see him back at Georgetown soon, according to Georgetown’s Chief Investment Officer Michael Barry.
“He is a very kind person, and from my experience, someone of integrity,” Barry wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We at the Investment Office are deeply saddened by his situation. We hope for his speedy return and keep him and his family in our prayers.”
Members of Georgetown University’s Asian American Student Association condemned the exit ban, calling it a violation of international human rights. 
“We call on the People’s Republic of China for the unconditional and immediate release of both Victor and Cynthia,” the AASA executive board wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Repeated violations of the most basic of human rights by Chinese authorities, such as in this instance, demand a strong response and constant vigilance.”

Live course registration, in which students choose classes in real time without delay from the university registrar, is set to replace the current preregistration system beginning in April for fall 2019 course selection.
The change addresses software incompatibilities and shifts away from the costly software customization used to run preregistration each year. Though the new live registration system has not yet been formally announced to students, it has received backlash from several students and was opposed in a 2016 Georgetown University Student Association referendum.
Under the new system, students receive a date and time when they can log into MyAccess to add courses. The registration window will open first for graduate students and then for undergraduate students according to class year, starting with seniors. The system will remain open until the add/drop period of the new semester ends, allowing students to make changes throughout summer or winter break.
The change to a live registration system was prompted by concerns over the future viability of the preregistration software in the face of a mandatory update of Banner, the student information system, according to College Vice Dean for Undergraduate Education Sue Lorenson. 
The current iteration of Banner is incompatible with Georgetown’s customized preregistration system, but at significant cost, the university kept preregistration running anyway. That will no longer be possible following the Banner update. 
“[T]he version of Banner that Georgetown is currently on, Banner 8, will soon no longer be supported by the parent company, Ellucian. Because the preregistration system is a customization, it will implode when we upgrade to Banner 9, which is on a different, more modern platform than Banner 8,” Lorenson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “And we have to upgrade to Banner 9;  if we don’t, the integrity of our entire student information system is in jeopardy.”
The new system will require students to prepare more rigorously, according to College Academic Council President Jacqueline Crispino (COL ’19). 
“People have to be ready to look up their classes ahead of time and come with, honestly, way more than their five classes,” Crispino said. “Come maybe with a group of 10 courses they would be willing to take, or a bunch of electives they don’t have to take.”  
Under the current preregistration system, schedules are delayed by weeks while the preregistrations are processed by the registrar’s office and students cannot make changes until the Add/Drop period begins. Last fall, preregistration opened Nov. 6 and closed for students in the College on Nov. 15 and on Nov. 18 for all other students. Results were not posted until Dec. 6, 2½ weeks after preregistration closed to all students. 
Under the live registration system, students will no longer rank classes by interest to increase their chances of landing a spot in the classes they care about most. Rather, priority will be assigned by seniority, except when departments or professors impose further restrictions. 
Academic departments are discussing ways to ensure courses include students from a range of class years and that majors can register for the classes they want, according to Lorenson. 
The current preregistration algorithm accounts for class year, major and class request ranking, while the new system would only account for class year, though seats can be set aside for students meeting certain qualifications to complete requirements, Lorenson said.
Students will always be able to get into the courses they need in order to graduate on time, according to Associate Vice President and University Registrar Annamarie Bianco.
The 2016 GUSA referendum on live registration exposed strong opposition to the then-proposal to switch to live registration. Eighty-three percent of respondents supported preregistration, while only 7 percent voted in favor of live registration, according to a report released by GUSA. 
“While the current system may be shrouded in behind-the-scenes schedule manipulation that limits process transparency, the referendum results demonstrate that students are more concerned with the prioritization and strategy that pre-registration promotes than they are with the clarity of this process,” the six-page report said. 
The 2016 referendum discussed several possible problems with the new system, including the difficulty of assigning priority to varsity athletes or other groups with specific scheduling concerns and the potential inconvenience for students studying abroad in different time zones, who may have to wake up in the middle of the night to register. 
The referendum also discussed the difficulty that the time-sensitive element may pose to those with restrictive work or class schedules, and therefore the possibility that students from lower socio-economic backgrounds will have less desirable schedules than wealthier students who do not have to work. The report acknowledges, though, that live registration would improve speed and transparency. 
Student responses to the change have been mostly negative so far, though most people have not yet heard about the change, according to Crispino. 
“Most people who hear about it seem to be against it,” Crispino said. “It’s definitely not the housing lottery. You have more than just a few minutes to choose.” 
However, students should not be overly concerned, according to Crispino. 
“I think it’s going to be a much easier system once you get past that first rush of students signing up, because you’ll know immediately how many seats are open,” Crispino said. “If you’re on summer break, and you decide you want to switch classes, you can just add something and drop something. So in that way it will be easier.”

Three listening sessions to gather student feedback on the U.S. Department of Education’s proposed changes to Title IX regulations are scheduled for next week, the university announced in a campuswide email Wednesday morning. 
The university is reviewing the regulations, announced Nov. 16, and will eventually offer a formal response independently or jointly with peer universities, according to the email, signed by Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia. First, however, the university will host open community meetings intended to collect student feedback on changes, a move unprecedented in recent years. 
“We face many complex issues as a nation, and sexual harassment and assault continue to demand our attention and action,” DeGioia wrote. “As an academic community, we have a responsibility to engage this issue thoughtfully and to pursue positive solutions.”
The proposed Title IX regulations reduce the number of instances of sexual harassment that universities must investigate, including eliminating off-campus incidents for consideration, and provide more rights to the accused, such as allowing lawyers for the accused to cross-examine the accuser.  
The Department of Education’s federally mandated comment period on the proposed regulations opened Thursday, Nov. 29, and will be open until Jan. 28. Any individual or group can submit public comments online or by mail for review by the Department of Education.
The listening sessions will be hosted by Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny (LAW ’87) and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson; they will be held in the Leavey Center and the Healey Family Student Center. Those unable to attend the sessions on Dec. 3, Dec. 6 or Dec. 10 have the option to digitally submit feedback via the RSVP form. 
The university will consider the comments as it determines which rules to address and how it will do so. The email did not outline the university’s timeline for its formal response.
Students Taking Action Against Interpersonal Violence encouraged community members to attend the listening sessions, although the group said the action falls short of community needs. 
“STAIV appreciates President DeGioia’s message to the student body regarding the proposed Title IX regulations and sexual assault at Georgetown,” STAIV wrote in a statement. “However, the university is still neglecting to establish a firm position against these proposed rules that would harm survivors and students in general.”
STAIV, an unrecognized student group working to counter sexual misconduct at Georgetown, noted that although the RSVP form allows students to provide comment, it is not anonymous and does not include clear information about the proposed changes. 
“The proposed regulations are intended to promote the purpose of Title IX by requiring recipients to address sexual harassment, assisting and protecting victims of sexual harassment and ensuring that due process protections are in place for individuals accused of sexual harassment,” according to the Department of Education. 
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has long promised updated Title IX regulations and in 2017 withdrew two Obama-era guiding documents, including the 2011 “Dear Colleague Letter” that required universities to use the lowest-possible legal standard of proof in an attempt to protect the accuser.
After the release of the proposed regulations, nearly 300 students signed a letter requesting that Georgetown University submit a comment opposing the regulations and urging transparency in the institutional response. Students delivered the letter, organized by STAIV, to the Office of the President on Nov. 16. 
Kilkenny affirmed the university’s commitment to preventing sexual misconduct and supporting survivors, at the time of the letter’s delivery. 
“We will continue to focus on education and prevention, support for survivors, and prompt and equitable processes to respond to reports and complaints of sexual misconduct,” Kilkenny said in an article published by The Hoya on Nov. 20. “Our current policies and processes continue to remain in place. We will carefully review the Department of Education’s proposed Title IX regulations.”
STAIV acknowledged that the listening sessions are a clear effort to respond to STAIV’s prior efforts to increase student input in university Title IX policy. 
“We recognize that the University is responding to our demands to facilitate student input and request administrators attend the town hall we are hosting in January when finals are over and students have more capacity to respond to these new proposed regulations,” the group wrote.
The email comes amid the university’s search for a new Title IX coordinator after Laura Cutway’s departure in June. The university has completed its first round of interviews for the position as of Nov. 15. In the meantime, Title IX Investigator Samantha Berner has served as interim Title IX coordinator, a move criticized by some student groups.
Listening sessions will also be held for the Georgetown University Law Center and Georgetown University Medical Center. 
DeGioia’s email emphasized the work of the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Advisory Committee regarding sexual misconduct prevention and education, including the launch of a second campus climate survey, set to open in the spring semester. 
“Georgetown University remains deeply committed to eradicating all forms of sexual assault and misconduct on campus and to providing an environment in which all members of our community can pursue their very best work,” DeGioia wrote. “We look forward to engaging with you on these important steps ahead.”

Only four days into her freshman year, Oona Nash (COL ’22) contracted bronchitis. 
When she went to the Student Health Center, the doctors gave her antibiotics. Nash expected to get better, but her illness got significantly worse over time. She discovered in October the culprit of her ailment: black mold.
“One day, my roommate and I were disinfecting our room, and I wiped over the radiator, and the wipe was covered in black mold,” Nash said in an interview with The Hoya. 
As Nash, who lives in freshman residence hall New South, got sicker and spent more time in her bed, the mold worsened her condition. 
“I had a deep chest cough and my bronchial tubes were congested, and my sinuses were clogged. I was constantly exhausted, and I got hives occasionally,” Nash said. “I went to the emergency room twice. The doctors told me that my illness was being caused by black mold spores.”
Black mold, or Stachybotrys chartarum, can cause upper respiratory issues, wheezing, congestion, red and itchy eyes and skin, fever, and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Nash is not the only student to fall ill from mold. Emily Coster (COL ’22), who lives in Village C West, has also suffered from the black mold in her radiator. 
“I have been sick since the day I arrived on campus. I’m extremely congested, I get lightheaded, I get fatigued, I get headaches whenever I’m in my room for an extended period of time,” Coster said in an interview with The Hoya. “My roommate has also exhibited these symptoms.”
Coster’s symptoms eventually got so bad that she was forced to evacuate her room not once, but twice.
“I went to the emergency room, and they couldn’t figure out what the problem was. I had suspected that it had something to do with the mold,” Coster said. “My lungs were inflamed. As a result, my mom booked a hotel room for me, and I stayed there for three nights. I felt much better when I was in the hotel without the mold-related symptoms.”
Along with requiring some to evacuate, mold-related illness has interrupted students’ lives in other ways. Nash’s illness affected her academics and social life. 
“I had to miss too much class because I was so sick, so I had to drop two of my classes. I couldn’t focus, and I was coughing. I had to drop out of chemistry, which is a problem, since I’m pre-med,” Nash said. “I’m now a partial student, because I had to drop so many credits. I almost had to take medical leave. I was sick for 2½ months; I just got better two weeks ago. I’m a runner, but I can’t run now. I couldn’t join any clubs or go out.”
Student facilities requests from August to October more than doubled this year, rising to 361 requests from 147 in 2017.
Black mold is more common in humid areas like Washington, D.C., according to the CDC.
“When mold spores drop on places where there is excessive moisture, such as where leakage may have occurred in roofs, pipes, walls, plant pots, or where there has been flooding, they will grow,” according to the CDC website.
Unusually high rates of rain this year exacerbated mold issues on campus, according to a university spokesperson. 
“By Aug. 22, before New Student Orientation, 2018 was already the sixth wettest year on record in more than 100 years. Then, by Sept. 23, it became the third wettest year on record for Washington,” a spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As of Monday, a 141 year record for rain in the month of November was broken and DC was within an inch of being the wettest year ever on record.” 
At 17.98 inches, the D.C. area received just over 10 more inches of rainfall between August and October 2018 than in the same time period last year, which received 7.39 inches, according to a university spokesperson.
Because of the increase in rainfall, the Office of Planning and Facilities Management has received an influx of work orders requesting mold removal. The heightened rainfall and humidity contributed to a high volume of work orders, Interim Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Gregory Simmons said.
“Our facilities office reviews all requests relating to mold and directs safety managers to conduct mold assessments within two business days,” Simmons wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The on-site assessment includes a visual inspection for the presence of mold, and also includes the monitoring of space temperature and relative humidity to ensure that those building conditions are not contributing to mold formation. Finally, the space is reviewed to determine if moisture has entered the space, and related repairs are scheduled as necessary.”
If mold is detected, cleanup typically occurs the same day, and dehumidifiers are installed if necessary, Simmons said. 
Students have been frustrated with facilities’ handling of mold-related complaints. Coster is disappointed with facilities and feels the administration does not prioritize students’ health.
“I think facilities is handling the mold poorly,” Coster said. “My neighbors are sick because they also have black mold in their radiator, and they put in seven work orders. Facilities never came. We had black mold in our showers, and they painted over the mold. We can still see it. We have mold in our carpet, too. Facilities brings dehumidifiers in for a day or two, but then they take them away and the mold comes back.”
The health and well-being of students is facilities’ top priority, Simmons said, encouraging students to seek help if they think their health is being affected by the presence of mold.
“If students believe mold is impacting any part of their health, we encourage them to contact Student Health Services for information about using the array of health services available to all students,” Simmons wrote. “Any student with a medical condition can work with the Academic Resource Center to request medical housing. Students who have a documented need will be assigned housing that meets their need.”

Alexis Yeager (COL ’22) first heard about Georgetown in ninth grade. That was the year she joined the Institute for College Preparation, a program that helps low-income Washington, D.C. students navigate college applications within Georgetown’s Center for Multicultural Equity and Access.
Without the ICP, Yeager is unsure if she would have enrolled in college. Like many other low-income students in the District, Yeager was filled with doubt about how her socio-economic status would translate in the eyes of college admission officers.
“I joined the program when I was in ninth grade,” Yeager said. “Before that, I wasn’t even thinking about college. I wanted to go to college but I was not sure if it was feasible given my situation at home. ”
Yeager’s brother went to H.D. Woodson High School, which primarily serves students in Ward 7, an area in Southeast D.C. with historically low-income neighborhoods.
Yeager herself attended School Without Walls in Foggy Bottom. A public magnet school, Walls offers special instruction and programs unavailable elsewhere, designed to attract a more diverse student body from across its school district.
But even with this resource at her disposal, Georgetown was not on Yeager’s radar.
“I don’t know if Georgetown really reached out to people in my high school,” Yeager said.
Georgetown takes pride in its D.C. location, citing its position in the “nation’s capital” as an asset for prospective students on its admission website. Yet of the 169 D.C. residents who applied to Georgetown’s class of 2022, 22 enrolled this fall. D.C. residents represent just over one percent of the 1622-person freshman class. Talented students who grew up in the District comprise a small component of Georgetown’s community due to accessibility obstacles for students from poorer wards.
Programs like the ICP seek to mitigate these barriers to applying by making higher education institutions like Georgetown more accessible to students living in the local community.
Pipeline to Access
Georgetown’s outreach to the D.C. community aims to empower students, primarily from Wards 7 and 8, to see the benefits of a post-secondary education. ICP constitutes one of several Georgetown initiatives which aim to improve its recruitment efforts in the District.
The ICP works with a cohort of around 35 students from middle schools in Ward 7. Starting in seventh grade, these “pre-college scholars” come to Georgetown’s campus every Saturday to attend classes so they are prepared for college by the time they graduate high school.  
In addition to this “Saturday Academy,” CMEA takes ICP participants on college tours. The creation of the D.C. Tuition Assistance Grant allows D.C. residents to attend any public college or university for the cost of in-state tuition. This District-sponsored initiative has expanded CMEA tours to include not only nearby schools on the East Coast but also state schools in the Midwest.
The ICP aims to get middle and high school students, who attend targeted D.C. public schools, interested in all post-secondary educational opportunities, not just Georgetown, according to Executive Director Charlene Brown-McKenzie.
“The goal is to inspire interest and hope in higher education,” Brown-McKenzie, who also serves as CMEA director, said. “That’s the ICP piece. It is about inspiring the possibilities of college access broadly. It is not a pipeline feeder to Georgetown.”
In addition to the ICP, the CMEA runs two other outreach programs in the D.C. community to engage with low-income students and prepare them for the possibility of attending college.
Each spring, student volunteers from Georgetown University teach a curriculum focusing on college and career preparation to sixth graders for six to eight weeks, with a campus visit at the end of the program. 
Georgetown continues to run Kids2College, a program aimed to make students aware of the viable option of attending college immediately after high school, Brown-McKenzie said. 
“We are probably the only institution in the D.C. area that continues doing the Kids2College program,” Brown-McKenzie said. “Why? Because of the best-practice literature. The literature says you start early. You start early and you start often.”
Georgetown also participates in the College Exposure-Dual Enrollment Program, which allows high school seniors from local public schools to enroll in courses at their local university — in this case, Georgetown — for free.
Georgetown is committed to spreading awareness of college opportunities to the local community that may not otherwise engage with the university, according to Brown-McKenzie. 
“It is our hope that we will continue to have the institutional support to really allow this to be a true gateway to post-secondary education for communities that would not normally have this opportunity,” Brown-McKenzie said. “We are just one part of the education sector.” 
Programs at the Center for Social Justice — including its academic tutoring and English mentorship programs like After School Kids and D.C. Schools Project — reinforce CMEA’s goals.
“I think with the work that especially the ASK program, the D.C. Schools Project is doing in our immigrant communities, they are seeing more and more messaging around Georgetown in the community,” Brown-McKenzie said. 
Homegrown Admissions
For Talhia Tuck, Georgetown’s associate director of admissions, reaching out to D.C. schools is a personal priority. Raised in the District, Tuck said her passion to provide greater access for local public school students stems from her grandmother, who taught in D.C. public schools.
The decision for D.C. residents to apply to local colleges requires a tailored recruiting approach from admissions, according to Tuck.
“Having grown up in D.C., I’m aware of the fact that they might have a different perspective because they are right here in the same place that Georgetown is. So I do think that students who are local might look at the decision to stay or leave in a different way,” Tuck said. “I try to start by talking about what I loved about D.C. and how being a student in D.C. in college is going to be different than their experience in high school.”
Georgetown recognizes the importance of involving District-based families to ensure its students success. As a result, Brown-McKenzie said the university makes sure its pre-college programs reach the wider support network of these low-income students. For families, the ICP offers a series of parent engagement workshops. 
Similarly, anyone who participates in Kids2College, a program for sixth graders, is automatically invited — funding permitted — to join the ICP, a program for seventh graders and above.
“It’s not just a one time, one shot deal,” Brown-Mckenzie said. 
The institute has seen immense success, according to Brown-McKenzie. One hundred percent of students from the class of 2014 went on to post-secondary education, including two-year and four-year institutions.
“We have historically achieved extraordinarily high graduation rates that far exceed that of the local schools and we continue to do so,” Brown-McKenzie said.
In fall 2015, the ICP welcomed its new cohort of students from partner middle schools in Ward 7, including Parkside Middle School, John Philip Sousa Middle School and Kelly Miller Middle School. ICP adopts a new cohort of approximately 35 low-income students every five or six years, once their previous class has graduated. The most recent cohort of students is on track to graduate high school in 2020 and college in 2024. 
Brown-McKenzie is optimistic about the future of the program as it continues to evolve and expand, such as through study abroad opportunities for ICP participants.
“The District is becoming so much more global, and poor folks across the river aren’t able to access what that means,” Brown-McKenzie said. “So we build in a study abroad component at no cost to the student. Again, not perfect, but for me, it’s one of the options that allows Georgetown to really be a special place. Can we do more? Of course.”
For Yeager, no background or income status should prevent local students seeking out university opportunities. She encouraged D.C. high school students to apply, despite concerns they might have.
“If you’re thinking about Georgetown, don’t be afraid to apply,” Yeager said. “Don’t get caught up in the preconceived notions you might have about a [predominantly white institution] or identity because on Georgetown’s campus, there’s definitely a community for everybody.”

A petition to ban the pro-abortion rights student group H*yas for Choice and all of its activities from Georgetown’s campus, introduced by Tradition Family Property Student Action, a national anti-abortion rights organization, launched on Nov. 8. 
The petition has received over 16,000 signatures as of Nov. 27.
The organization is “pro-life, pro-marriage and pro-God” and seeks to advance Christian values on college campuses, according to the TFP Student Action website. TFP counts Georgetown students and alumni among its members, TFP Student Action Director John Ritchie said. However, HFC first appeared on TFP’s radar after a Fox News article covered HFC’s initiative to offer free emergency contraception on Georgetown’s campus, according to Ritchie.
Although HFC does not receive funding and is not officially recognized by the university, the petition calls on University President John J. DeGioia to ban the student group for its “anti-Catholic” message.
“With or without recognition, any club that promotes the killing of innocent life or lobbies for the unnatural agenda of the homosexual movement should be barred from an institution worthy of the name Catholic,” volunteer Domenick Galatolo wrote on the TFP Student Action website. 
HFC members are not concerned about the potential effects of the petition as they claim that the university cannot ban the organization without infringing on student rights, according to HFC Co-Director of Communications Elianna Schiffrik (COL ’21).
“In general, we are not taking too seriously this petition from an off-campus group calling on Georgetown to ban our organization,” Schiffrik wrote. “As an unrecognized group that operates on campus entirely based on individual student rights, there are no immediate steps that Georgetown could take to ban H*yas for Choice that wouldn’t change overall student rights.”
According to Schiffrik, although HFC’s daily operations have not impacted by the petition, HFC is cautious about anti-abortion rights groups.
“We are incredibly aware, however, that the anti-choice movement has frequently used violence and intimidation to terrorize reproductive justice activists and abortion providers, so we’re staying cautious,” Schiffrik wrote. “As of now, the petition has not impacted our operations in any way.”
The university’s continued acceptance of HFC’s presence on campus betrays its Catholic heritage, according to Ritchie.
“H*yas for Choice is acting like a chapter for Planned Parenthood on campus – promoting abortion and contraception – which makes Georgetown look more like UC Berkeley,” Ritchie wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Though Pope Francis softened the church’s stance on those who received abortions, initiating a path for absolution, the Catholic Church remains firmly opposed to abortion, according to The New York Times.
HFC’s presence on campus is unacceptable even as an unrecognized group, according to Galatolo.
“The ability to undermine the right to life and promote the Culture of Death appears to be enhanced by the lack of official recognition,” Galatolo wrote. 
TFP intends to send the petition to DeGioia after it receives 20,000 signatures, according to Ritchie.
HFC posted a link to the petition and a corresponding video on their Facebook page Nov. 9. The post encouraged HFC followers to donate to the group.
“Actually though, this video and petition are equal parts entertaining and horrifying. We face this kind of right-wing backlash to our efforts to advocate for reproductive and sexual healthcare on campus every day. Disagree? Donate and show your support,” the Facebook post said.
There has been an increase in donations and significant student support for HFC in response to the petition, according to Schiffrik.
“Many people have offered words of sympathy, support, and thanks for the services we provide the Georgetown community in the days since we posted about the petition on Facebook, and we also saw a spike in donations after our post,” Schiffrik wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Campus convenience stores Hoya Snaxa and Vital Vittles will no longer sell select flavors of Juul pods, flavored e-liquid cartridges used with Juul e-cigarettes,  following Juul Labs’ Nov. 13 announcement that it will reduce the pods available in stores. 
Students of Georgetown, Inc., commonly known as The Corp, operates Snaxa and Vittles and began selling mango, fruit, creme and cucumber Juul pods last spring. These flavors will no longer be sold in The Corp’s storefronts, although tobacco, mint and menthol flavors will be. 
“The Corp has always complied with all rules and regulations that apply to tobacco sales,” Alex Gong (SFS ’20), CEO and President of The Corp, wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We will abide by Juul’s decision to suspend flavored pod sales and foresee no major disruption to our operations.”
Juul Labs’ decision comes as the Georgetown University Student Association has looked to work with The Corp to end tobacco and nicotine sales on campus, according to GUSA Policy Chair for Student Health Casey Kozak (NHS ’20). The e-cigarettes have come under fire nationally since gaining popularity amongst teens and young adults, many of whom were not formerly smokers, according to The New York Times. 
“It’s not secret that Juuls have become a popular commodity among students, and they are used in just about every part of campus,” Kozak wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Some students have even reported seeing fellow classmates using Juuls during class. I hope that as we move away from tobacco and nicotine products, we can begin to move towards incorporating lifestyle habits that help us feel healthy, happy, and in control.”
On the same day Juul Labs made its announcement, the Food and Drug Administration announced plans to regulate flavored cigars in an ongoing effort to reduce youth tobacco use, according to The Washington Post.
The agency has targeted Juuls in the past, and this recent announcement expands the scope of action it plans to take against tobacco and nicotine. Cigarette use persists on Georgetown’s campus even as vapes and Juuls become more popular. 
Kozak used a survey to help GUSA understand students’ attitudes toward tobacco and nicotine.
“Thanks to all of the students who filled out our survey, I have a collective picture of student opinions towards tobacco sales on campus,” she wrote. “I believe this information will be extremely helpful to all parties involved, and will help us improve as a campus.”
Kozak acknowledged that the shift away from nicotine products would affect business profits, but is more concerned with the products’ health effects.
“The largest concern around Juuls is the amount of nicotine within them, and how this can lead to addictive behaviors, especially in young users,” Kozak wrote. “My afterthought reaction was the way this decision will affect convenience stores everywhere, including our very own on campus, that often gain large profits from these sales. The more our country moves away from tobacco and nicotine usage, the more convenience stores and other sellers will have to adjust how they make a profit.”
The Corp has not disclosed how much profit it makes from tobacco and nicotine sales.
This post has been updated at 6:21 p.m. on Nov. 30 to reflect that The Corp will continue to sell tobacco, mint and menthol flavored Juul pods and that Juul Labs’s announcement to reduce flavored pod retail sales was on Nov. 13.

Nine Washington, D.C. Councilmembers introduced a bill that would compel businesses to give workers two hours of paid leave on Election Day. 
The bill, called the Paid Leave to Vote Amendment Act of 2018, was introduced Nov. 20. If passed, the bill would grant workers up to two hours of paid leave to vote in all District-wide elections. It would also make it illegal for employers to interfere with or deny employees’ attempts to vote. Currently, the District has no law requiring employers provide workers time off to vote.
If the council passes the legislation, D.C. would join 20 states that guarantee employees paid time to vote during the work day, according to Vote411.org. Ten other states allow employees unpaid time off to vote.
Though District elections generally followed accessibility procedures this November, Councilmember Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3), one of the bill’s sponsors, criticized the elections for being inaccessible to employees who cannot wait in long lines or commute to the polls because of work requirements in a Nov. 20 statement.
“The right to vote is the bedrock of our democracy, yet the District does not have any protections in place for residents who need to take leave in order to vote,” Cheh wrote. “There is more we can do to ensure that all eligible voters are able to engage in this important civic duty, and guaranteeing leave is one way we can remove some of the practical barriers to higher voter participation.”
Select employers in the District already granted their workers paid leave on Election Day this year. Restaurants Cava and &pizza were two of several businesses that allowed employees paid leave, and Patagonia was closed on Election Day. 
Local restaurant chain &pizza gave employees the time off during the work day to encourage them to participate in causes they care about, according to &pizza co-founder and CEO Michael Lastoria.
“Voting is an essential right and our employee base is largely made up of young people whose voices desperately need to be heard right now,” Lastoria wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Cava recognizes that there are many barriers workers face that result in them not being able to vote, co-founder Ted Xenohristos told Washingtonian on Oct. 22.
“It’s not always easy for everyone with childcare and finding transportation and working multiple jobs,” Xenohristos said. “With the voter turnout being so low in the states, we’re trying to get people to be part of their communities and get them involved.”
This resolution follows a series of initiatives the council has considered to ease voter accessibility. D.C. began automatically registering residents who complete applications for drivers licenses in June, and recently tabled legislation would lower the District’s voting age to 16. 
Although the bill has been referred to the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety, there have been no further updates yet, according to the D.C. Council’s website. 
However, according to the &pizza spokesperson, the experiment was a success.
“We heard amazing feedback from both our employees and customers who supported us fully in this decision, and will continue to provide our Tribe with the time and resources to take a stance on the causes that matter most to them,” the Lastoria wrote.

Sure hope this legislation gets passed.  It is definitely needed to prevent more voter suppression.  Heck, even though there is Early Voting for 12 days prior to Election Day, including on Saturday and Sunday, and that really-hard-to-do Absentee Ballot, which doesn’t even require a stamp, why not require paid leave to vote on Election Day.

The nation’s spicy and sweet staple, mumbo sauce, became the center of an unexpected debate when  Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) claimed that the sauce is not quintessential D.C. in a Facebook post Nov. 20. 
“Is anybody else annoyed by Mumbo sauce?” Bowser wrote in her Facebook post. “I wish people would stop suggesting that it is quintessential DC. I’m just saying I was a full grown woman before I had heard of mumbo sauce! So there, I’ve said it.”
Bowser’s post sparked controversy around the District, with some users commenting that her post reflects the effects of gentrification in D.C. Bowser’s post received over 1,500 comments as of Wednesday evening.
Although it was originally created in Chicago during the late 1900s, mumbo sauce gained its popularity in D.C. and is now more popular in the District than in Chicago, according to The Washington Post. The popular condiment, a barbecue-sauce-like combination of spicy and sweet flavors, can now be found all over the District, particularly in local takeout restaurants.
Bowser’s comment is a shift from her previously expressed view of mumbo sauce. In a 2017 letter written to Arsha and Charles Jones, who founded Capital City, a company that sells the sauce, Bowser praised the couple and their sauce’s impact on the city, according to The Washington Post.
“Nothing makes me prouder than when a DC native builds on a dream and sells a product that reminds customers young and old about our great city,” Bowser wrote in the letter.
Del. David Moon (D) from the Maryland House of Delegates issued his own comment through Twitter, mocking Bowser’s post but replacing mumbo sauce with Old Bay, Maryland’s own popular seasoning, according to The Washington Post.
“Is anybody else annoyed by Old Bay seasoning? I wish people would stop suggesting that it is quintessential MD. I’m just saying I was a full grown man before I had heard of Old Bay seasoning! So there, I’ve said it,” Moon tweeted.
Despite the widespread negative response to the post, Bowser intended to spur a friendly citywide debate and conversation for Thanksgiving, said LaToya Foster, press secretary and deputy communications director for media relations. 
“The Mayor wanted to provide DC residents something to discuss on Thanksgiving beyond the midterm elections, backup quarterbacks and holiday shopping deals,” Foster wrote in an email to The Hoya. “All may participate in the debate; however, DC residents must lead the mumbo sauce portion.”

A Washington, D.C. neighborhood advisory commission voted to rename a street outside the Saudi Embassy in honor of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October.n
Advisory neighborhood commission 2A, which oversees the Foggy Bottom and West End neighborhoods, voted unanimously Wednesday night to name a section of New Hampshire Avenue outside Saudi Arabia’s embassy “Jamal Khashoggi Way,” according to ANC 2A Chairman William Smith.
Following the ANC’s vote, the D.C. Council will review the issue for approval. The approval process may occur in January because the end of the D.C Council’s session is at the end of December, Smith said. Current city code only allows public spaces to be named in honor of anyone who has been deceased for more than two years, postponing the street’s renaming. 
A CIA assessment concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman likely ordered the murder of Khashoggi, The Washington Post reported Nov. 16. 
ANC 2A, which does not usually involve itself in incidents of international significance, wanted to commemorate Khashoggi because he was a D.C. resident. The commission also felt that an appropriate response from President Donald Trump was missing, according to Smith.
“That created a vacuum, and in our system of government, we have different branches, and we felt it was appropriate to say something that reinforced the values we think are part of our heritage,” Smith said, referring to the lack of appropriate response from Trump.
Trump has cast doubt on the veracity of the CIA report and has indicated his willingness to continue cooperating with Crown Prince Mohammed. The crown prince and Saudi Ambassador Khalid bin Salman, who was allegedly also implicated in the CIA report, have both continually denied their involvement in Khashoggi’s murder.
The spokesperson for the Saudi Embassy in D.C. did not respond to requests for comment as of press time. 
Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), whose ward includes ANC 2A, supports the initiative to rename the street in honor of Khashoggi, according to his communications director, Joe Florio. 
Evans will support the resolution even if it takes two years to move forward, Florio said in an interview with The Hoya.
The resolution to rename the street comes in part as a response to a petition launched by Michael Werz, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and adjunct professor at Georgetown University, and Gary Schmitt, a resident scholar and director of the Program on American Citizenship and Resident Scholar Strategic Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.
“It is important for the Saudi government and its leadership to be reminded, and our American government to assert, that such behavior is unacceptable,” Werz and Schmitt wrote in an opinion piece published in The Hill. “Requiring Saudi officials to come to work every day at ‘Jamal Khashoggi Way’ is one simple way to get this point across in a daily and concrete fashion.”
The petition, which urges Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and the D.C. Council to allow for a public street in honor of Khashoggi despite current city code, received over 8,100 signatures as of Thursday afternoon. 
“Given the principles at stake, we urge Mayor Muriel Bowser and the DC Council to make an exception in this case,” the petition reads.
Before Wednesday night’s vote, Smith shared the proposed resolution with the Committee to Protect Journalists, an nongovernmental organization that promotes freedom of speech and seeks to protect the rights of journalists. The CPJ expressed support for the resolution at Wednesday’s meeting and sought to ensure that ANC 2A’s residents understood its significance, according to CPJ’s Washington Advocacy Manager Michael DeDora.
“It sends a daily reminder to Saudi officials that U.S. residents reject their repressive tactics and strongly support freedom of thought and of the press,” DeDora said in a statement at Wednesday night’s commission meeting. “If the Saudis can get away with the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, then no journalist anywhere is safe.” 
Though much of the CPJ’s work focuses on the international arena, protecting free speech on a local level is imperative as well, according to DeDora.
“It’s wonderful that a local government would take such strong action in response to an international incident,” DeDora said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s also very important that at the local level, United States citizens are able to express themselves and pursue democratic measures to make those expressions heard in the community.”

A petition to add treadmill desks to Lauinger Library was introduced before Thanksgiving break.
Martha Winslow (COL ’21) posted the petition on Facebook as a discussion event to be held today. The petition gained traction, and 137 Facebook users have indicated they expect to attend the event Friday afternoon. Another 368 users expressed interest in the event.
Winslow said she hopes adding treadmill desks to Lau will help students do better academically.  
“There have (probably) been studies shown that correlate productivity to standing and/or walking. And honestly like I think I have back problems from leaning over the tables in Lau 2 far too often,” Winslow wrote in the event information section.
Winslow originally got this idea from visiting a friend at a different college where the library actually had treadmill desks, she said. 
“I visited my friend who goes to a small college in Santa Barbara and they had treadmill desks in their library — that’s what the picture in the Facebook event is, it’s a picture from their library — and I just thought it was really cool,” Winslow said.
Treadmill desks have potential health benefits, because they enable students to spend their study time standing up, Winslow said.
“I definitely think that the health benefits are important,” Winslow said. “Speaking from my personal experience, I have back problems just because I played a lot of sports growing up which kind of messed up my back — nothing super serious.”
Studies have shown mixed results regarding the effectiveness of using treadmill desks. A University of Michigan study showed that they do not affect thinking processes but do decrease memory function.
The treadmill desks could help mitigate Georgetown’s stress culture, Winslow said. 
“It’s also just like part of the Georgetown culture, it’s like you study all the time, you stay up late,” Winslow said. “So I actually think it would be useful and benefit just [your] physical health to be able to walk while you’re doing your readings.”
Winslow said she believes students will feel more comfortable working out and completing academic assignments in Lau than in Yates Field House.
“I know some people who bring their readings to Yates sometimes,” she said. “I’ve never done that because I’m too scared of the judgment, but like if it were here, then there wouldn’t be a judgment because you’re in the library.”
The idea for treadmill desks began as a joke, but Winslow said she is serious about pursuing this change to Lau. 
“I have not done a lot of research on this. My current plan is to do some research before I actually present it to some higher authority,” Winslow said. “It started out as lowkey a joke but then it ended up gaining so much support there’s like a ton of people saying that they’re going to an event that I don’t even know. So now I’m like if people actually agree with me then maybe I could take [the petition] somewhere and actually make it happen.”
Casey Doherty (COL ’20), Georgetown University Student Association director of campus affairs, said she plans to bring the petition to the next GUSA senior staff meeting. 
“I’m actually planning on bringing it up at my next GUSA senior staff meeting, to see if there’s anything we can do to help this project,” Doherty wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Despite the attention the petition garnered on Facebook, Doherty said GUSA has not yet determined its stance on the petition. 
“We haven’t discussed it as a senior staff yet, so I am unsure about anyone else’s interest,” Doherty wrote.
Doherty said she favors the petition, but that the project may need amendments to make it more feasible.
“I am in favor of the petition, but I understand that treadmill desks will be costly,” Doherty wrote. “I would definitely be interested in advocating for less-costly standing desks in Lau.”
The proposal is set to be brought to the GUSA senior staff meeting this Sunday, Dec. 2.

Washington, D.C. residents released from local correctional facilities are eligible for an academic and employment-centered fellowship program.
The Georgetown Pivot Program is a fellowship for formerly incarcerated individuals through a one-year transition and re-entry program with a non-credit-bearing certificate in business and entrepreneurship. The program, which began this November, is a partnership between local government and university entities that blends academic work and supported employment..
Pivot Program fellows engage in a full-time program and spend half their time in class and training and the rest in internships. The curriculum focuses on business and entrepreneurial training, general academics and liberal arts courses to develop fellows’ professional skills, according to Pivot Program Academic Director Alyssa Lovegrove. 
“The program also lets us give back to the community, in line with Jesuit values, including inclusivity and service,” Lovegrove said in an interview with The Hoya. “This program is also a great way for us to use our network as the business school.” 
The program is a collaboration between the McDonough School of Business, Georgetown College, the Georgetown Prisons and Justice Initiative, the Washington, D.C. Department of Employment Services, the Mayor’s Office on Returning Citizen Affairs, and the D.C. Department of Small and Local Business Development. 
“[The program] was an evolution and outgrowth of some of the programs that already exist, including the Georgetown Prison Scholars Program,” she said. 
The Prison Scholars Program, launched in January 2018, offers courses to incarcerated D.C. residents awaiting trial, serving short sentences or preparing to return to their communities after a longer incarceration period.
However, Lovegrove said employers with knowledge of a candidate’s status as a formerly incarcerated individual may feel less comfortable hiring that candidate, a dilemma the Pivot Program hopes to alleviate.
“A big proportion of the workers are formerly incarcerated. If you can’t find employment, you can’t make a living,” she said. “These people might not get past the door. We are trying to get employers to look at people as individuals and become more comfortable employing formerly incarcerated people.” 
The Pivot Program is selective, with space for only 20 fellows, though it may expand in the future. The program looks for leadership capability in applicants, given the program’s focus on community-based entrepreneurship, Lovegrove said. 
Lovegrove described the pressing need for such a program in the District and the United States more broadly. 
“There are more than seven million Americans currently under some form of correctional control, and one in four adults has a criminal record,” Lovegrove said. 
D.C. has the highest incarceration rate in the country and the third-highest rate of criminal justice control, according to the Justice Policy Institute. About 5 percent of the D.C. population is under some form of criminal justice control like incarceration or probation.
The Pivot Program intends to ensure employment readiness and prepare fellows for a variety of futures and outcomes, including long-term employment, entrepreneurship or continuing education, according to the program website. 
Lovegrove explained that, with additional resources, the Pivot Program will ideally raise funding and support for the businesses envisioned by the fellows. 
“Access to funding and capital would be something we’d look for in the future,” she said. 
Lovegrove said she hopes students will become involved in the program. 
“We are hoping to find ways for students to get engaged — students could possibly be tutors and mentors to these individuals,” she said.
Going forward, the Pivot Program hopes to expand the possible entry points for formerly incarcerated individuals beyond the current restrictions, Lovegrove said. 
“We’d like to create a program that can be replicated elsewhere, both here and in other cities,” Lovegrove said.“We’d like to make something other universities can replicate. It would be wonderful to have a program like this elsewhere beyond D.C. in other urban areas.”

More than 100 senior women in the Georgetown Scholarship Program attended the eighth annual LOFT Styling Workshop earlier this month to learn tips for dressing in the workplace and select professional clothing provided by LOFT.
The event took place at the women’s clothing retailer’s branch on Wisconsin Avenue and was organized by LOFT in cooperation with GSP, which provides support, advising, networking and mentoring to over 600 Georgetown undergraduates, most of whom are first-generation college students or come from low-income family backgrounds. 
The LOFT workshop began after members of the GSP Advisory Board realized students in the program needed guidance on professional clothing options. The board brought students to a LOFT store to help them find appropriate outfits, according to GSP Assistant Director Mariana González (MSB ’15).
“Our board members took some of our senior ladies to LOFT to help them pick out clothes for interviews that they had coming up,” González said. “Gary Muto, who was the CEO of LOFT at the time, had a daughter going to Georgetown, and he found out that we had done this and he thought it was amazing and offered to provide that opportunity for all GSP senior ladies.”
Workshop attendees each received a $250 gift card to use at the LOFT store, in addition to a special 50 percent discount on all clothing items in the store, according to González, who served as the GSP staff liaison for the LOFT workshop and worked with LOFT to help coordinate the event. 
A GSP graduate herself, González attended the workshop twice during her time at Georgetown. 
González said the event with LOFT allowed her to feel more prepared for the interview process when she was a student.
“The workshop was really special. I had a number of interviews that I was able to use my clothing for,” González said. “A sentiment that we’ve had echoed from a lot of our senior ladies is that it goes beyond just getting clothes — it gives an added level of confidence in knowing that you have people who believe in and support you so much that they’re willing to do all of this.”
In addition to the complimentary merchandise, LOFT also brought in employees to offer GSP students advice on crafting a professional wardrobe, picking the right clothing choices for different workplace situations, mixing and matching outfits effectively, and shopping with a budget in mind. 
Beatrice Hociota (MSB ’19), a GSP student who attended the workshop, said she gained helpful professional insight from the event.
“While this experience gave me some key pieces to have in my wardrobe for the workforce next year, it also taught me a lot about how to continue to be smart with my purchase in the future,” Hociota wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It prepared me for the immediate future and enabled me to succeed going forward as well.”

Community activist and co-founder of nonprofit One Common Unity Hawah Kasat will be awarded the 2019 John Thompson Jr. Legacy of a Dream award, Georgetown University announced Nov. 20.
Georgetown presents the Legacy of a Dream award annually to an individual who has shown outstanding service consistent with the Jesuit value of women and men for others. 
One Common Unity is a nonprofit organization seeking to break the cycle of community violence by promoting music, art and nonviolence education. OCU works to spread its mission among Washington, D.C. children ages 11 to 18, primarily through after-school programming and summer camps.
“We’re using the arts and we’re using education to heal communities and transform people’s lives,” Kasat said in an interview with The Hoya.
Kasat and his co-founders started the organization in 2000 following a string of school shootings, a phenomenon he believes increases the organization’s relevance in the current era. 
“Throughout the country, we are being faced with violence in all forms. Gun violence is one of those forms, but there’s so much division and polarization and conflict that’s happening, we require and we need outlets and skills to handle conflict nonviolently,” Kasat said. “It’s really relevant — it’s probably more relevant today than it was even back then.”
In the 2018-2019 school year, OCU’s flagship Fly By Light program is set to serve 5,000 youth in 15 D.C. public schools through a combination of workshops, field trips, performances and nature retreats, all of which have the goal of promoting artistic expression, social-emotional literacy, health and wellness, environmental leadership, social justice and peace education, according to the OCU website.
OCU runs educational programs for local teachers, artists and musicians, encouraging them to promote peace and create student communities built around compassion. OCU’s programs have engaged over 25,000 people in its education and artistic efforts, according to the OCU website. 
A recently completed five-year impact survey from OCU reported that 84 percent of their former students graduated high school, while D.C.’s average 2018 high school graduation rate was 60 percent, according to The Washington Post. The same survey showed that zero percent of former OCU program participants spent time in juvenile detention, jail or prison. 
The Legacy of a Dream award is named in honor of its first recipient, John Thompson Jr., the influential Georgetown basketball coach emeritus. Throughout his career, Thompson promoted the fair treatment of athletes, particularly athletes of color, in the NCAA.
In the past, recipients of the award have included both domestic and international civil rights leaders. Previous honorees include Rosa Parks, who was given the award posthumously in 2006, and former basketball player and prominent humanitarian Dikembe Mutombo (COL ’91), who was honored in 2010. 
Since 2013, the focus of the award has shifted to promote local activism and encourage community leaders in the District, according to Georgetown’s description of the award. 
The recipient of the award enters into a yearlong commitment and sustained partnership with the university, aiming to create better recognition and opportunity for their organization and their cause. 
Kasat said while he is honored to receive the award, the purpose of his community work has not been to gain recognition.
“This is a great boost and a great opportunity to reflect on what we’ve done, and I feel really grateful to have been chosen,” Kasat said. “My whole life has been dedicated to this work for 20 years, and you don’t do this work to get recognized — I’ve never done this work to get recognized. I’ve been doing this work because it’s my life’s calling, it’s what makes me feel good about looking in the mirror every day and feeling like I’m living a life worth waking up to.”
Kasat is set to be formally presented with the award on Jan. 21, 2019, at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, as a part of the free “Let Freedom Ring!” celebration for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

The food system in Latin America must be reformed to create healthier options for low-income and vulnerable groups, Eugenio Díaz-Bonilla, head of the International Food Policy Research Institute’s Latin America Program, said at an event Nov. 27 at the Intercultural Center. 
A food system includes the inputs and outputs of all the processes involved in the production and distribution of food, from growing the food to the disposal of food. The International Food Policy Research Institute’s Latin America Program seeks to eliminate malnutrition by evaluating food practices within the Latin American food system.
The event also featured adjunct professor for the Center for Latin American Studies Patricia Biermayr-Jenzano, IFPRI research analyst Florencia Paz and visiting researcher Patricia Caporaso. The Center for Latin American Studies and the Latin America Leadership Program, which manages programs hosted by Georgetown’s Latin American Board, sponsored the event. 
Though many Latin American countries h xave poverty and hunger rates far lower than other developing regions, their residents still struggle with maintaining an adequate level of nutrition in their diets and many suffer from vitamin deficiencies, according to Díaz-Bonilla.
“About 200 million people suffer from vitamin deficiencies, although this is an old number that the Food and Agriculture Organization is recalculating,” Díaz-Bonilla said. “About 1.9 million people are at least overweight.”
The Latin American food system involves the contributions of 50 percent of the global population and generates around 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, Díaz-Bonilla said.
Restructuring the entire food system poses logistical challenges and risks negative effects on the economy and employment, according to Díaz-Bonilla. 
“You want to have a food system that generates good employment, that reduces poverty, that uses low energy,” Díaz-Bonilla said. “There is a basic reality in economics that if you have more than one objective, you need more than one instrument. It’s not easy to coordinate.”
Minimal access to health options causes obesity among those of a lower economic status, according to Díaz-Bonilla. 
Yet, the issue of obesity is difficult to quantify because of other factors such as ethnicity and genetics. As a result, the conditions can affect certain ethnicities at a greater rate than others, according to Díaz-Bonilla.
Obesity disproportionately affects women in Latin America and the Caribbean compared to other regions, according to Biermayr-Jenzano, who is affiliated with the Latin America, environmental studies and women’s studies departments at Georgetown.
“The rise of this condition has gender implications, disproportionately affecting women in more than 20 countries in the region,” Biermayr-Jenzano said. “The rate of female obesity is 10 percent higher than for men, pointing to the gender divide, as we call it.”
A point of entry for improving the food system is through increasing the quantity of healthy food at informal street vendors, according to Biermayr-Jenzano. On the beaches in Salvador, Brazil, only 0.4 percent of street vendors currently sell fruit, according to Biermayr-Jenzano.
“I have seen women in Latin America being 80 percent of those who sell food on the streets. They are like the entry point to offer good options instead of foods high in sugar, or fried,” Biermayr-Jenzano said. “If we have these people offering these options [be] more educated with certifications, we can improve a lot of the food offerings.” 
Reshaping the food system in Latin America is urgently needed, according to Caporaso, who researches food policy and strategy in relationship to the food system and obesity in Mexico, Chile and Brazil. Nearly 60 percent of people in Latin America are overweight, Caporaso said. 
“The numbers speak for themselves,” Caporaso said. “58 percent of people in Latin America are overweight. If we don’t do serious work and fast, this problem is going to increase seriously.”
Improving the food system and health outcomes for Latin American residents requires evaluating and considering already existing policy, according to Caporaso. 
“There are several countries in Latin America that have developed policies already, so the objective is to evaluate their effectiveness and the challenges,” Caporaso said.

Climate change will have drastic economic, political and military consequences worldwide because of its effects on the Arctic, members of a university working group on the Arctic said at an event on Wednesday in the Mortara Center.
The panel included Director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy Ambassador Barbara Bodine, professor of environmental policy Jeremy Mathis and Director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Heather Conley. The working group released a report in July entitled “The New Arctic,” detailing the changing environment of the Arctic.
The report studied the long-term effects of climate change, including the effects it will have on indigenous populations. The changes in the Arctic cannot be reversed, and they will have lasting political and economic impacts on the entire world, Bodine said.
“The Arctic is drastically changing and there is no turning back at this point,” Bodine said. “And there’s probably nowhere where the effects of climate change and what it means for economics, trade, the environment and security all comes together and is more pronounced than in the Arctic.”
Climate change directly relates to the increased incidence of major storms, droughts and threats to the livelihoods of indigenous communities within the Arctic, according to Bodine. 
The global threat of climate change is physically more pronounced within the Arctic Circle, according to Mathis, who said that the Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet.  
“We know that the permafrost is thawing, we know the glaciers are melting, we know all these physical changes are happening,” Mathis said.
The landscape of the Arctic is undergoing unprecedented and massive changes, evident in the form of melting ice, Mathis said. 
“We’re running out of adjectives to describe what’s happening in the Arctic,” Mathis said. “Every year we think, ‘This can’t change faster than it’s changing now,’ and then we step into a new reality that we didn’t quite predict and understand, and then it gets worse the following year.”
The Arctic is emerging as a future focal point of economic competition because of its accessible resources such as oil and natural gas. Infrastructure is needed to support these emerging resources, Bodine said. 
“The U.S. geologic survey estimates that the Arctic contains 1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 90 billion barrels of oil,” Bodine said. “This, however, is not going to happen overnight. It’s going to take at least 20 years for these minerals and these resources to come onto the market. The reason for this is that there is scant infrastructure in the Arctic region.”
The management of the newly accessible resources needs to be addressed multilaterally, according to Bodine. 
The United States lacks a significant policy towards the Arctic, but will need to develop one to protect its national security, Mathis said.
“We have to start thinking about this as a clear and present danger to … our national security and our way of life, and our way of thinking about how we interact with the environment,” Mathis said.
The working group hopes that producing this report will help educate the public about the Arctic’s importance as a region, Bodine said.
“We need to make a much better effort to communicate with and inform and educate the American public … on what is going on in the Arctic: that it is not the land of Santa Claus and reindeer; it is not a frozen inhospitable wasteland,” Bodine said. “It is the new global commons and what happens there will and is already affecting us. We need to be prepared to take steps.”
