An unknown suspect broke into a house on 3600 T St. early Thursday morning and stole jewelry, cash, a laptop and other personal items, according to a Public Safety Alert released Thursday evening. The house is not occupied by Georgetown students.
The suspect entered through a window left open on the ground floor of the house. The Metropolitan Police Department’s Lt. Victor Braschnewitz wrote that while it was a burglary, the residents were partly responsible, in an email to the Burleith listserv.
“Note that the method of entry in this burglary is consistent with recent burglaries in the upper end of the Second District. I would like to reissue a warning to those of you who may not feel the need to close your ground level windows at night to please take heed and reconsider your safeguarding standards,” Braschnewitz said.
This is the second burglary in Burleith in three weeks. On Aug. 30, a suspect broke into a house on the 3800 block of S Street and sexually assaulted a sleeping female.”

The Jess and Mildred Fisher Center for Familial Cancer Research recently awarded two $20,000 pilot grants for research on cancer to Georgetown University Medical Center professors Peter Shields and Mitchell Jung.
The grants are designed to fund innovative but basic science, clinical, epidemiological or behavioral research projects that epitomize the goals of the Fisher Center. Applications that address ethical and health policy issues were also considered.
Jung, a research assistant professor in the department of biochemistry and molecular biology, received the grant for his efforts to study the role of PARP-1 on DNA damage response and repair, specifically on BRCA mutant cells.
“Our laboratory has been focusing on characterizing the cellular and molecular functions of ADP-ribosylation,” Jung said. “Therefore, our current study fits well with the aims of the Jess and Mildred Fisher Cancer Research, and it did not take much time to narrow down the research topic.”
According to Jung, the process for obtaining the funding took about two months, and his research will span a year to a year and a half.
Shields, a professor in the department of oncology and medicine and deputy director of the Lombardi Cancer Center and vice chair of the department of oncology, is researching the radical procedure known as prophylactic oophorectomy, which is when both healthy ovaries are surgically removed in women who are at high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer.
The surgery has a high morbidity, increasing risk for premature death, heart disease, decreased cognitive functioning and osteoporosis. Shields’ research proposes to assess the metabolome (a network of that includes intermediates and products of metabolism as well as hormones) before and after surgery to locate and specify hormonally related metabolites that could predict unfavorable effects to oophoreectomy.
Applications for the pilot funding for 2011 will be available sometime this fall. Faculty members of any level are eligible to apply as well as postdoctoral students.”

In the culmination of a highly contested race to determine the next mayor of D.C., Council Chairman Vincent Gray defeated incumbent Mayor Adrian Fenty in the Democratic Primary on Tuesday, handily winning the majority of the District’s black vote.
With almost 90 percent of the precincts tallied at 2:30 a.m. on Wednesday, showing a 53 to 46 percent lead for Gray, Fenty’s campaign conceded the election to Gray according to The Washington Post. Gray declared victory at 1:56 a.m. Wednesday, writing on his campaign blog, “We did it!” Although the primary determines the Democratic candidate for the general election, the Republican party has not submitted a candidate for the vote on Nov. 2.
Demographics played a key part in Fenty’s defeat. Before the election, 64 percent of black Democrats supported Gray, while 64 percent of white Democrats supported Fenty, according to a Washington Post poll taken two weeks before the election.
In the elections, 80 percent of Anacostia, a majority black region across the Anacostia River, voted for Gray, while 80 percent of the majority white portions of Northwest D.C. voted for Fenty, according to The Washington Post.
Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), who won the Democratic primary to run as the House representative for D.C., addressed the racial divide in the election.
“We will need a city where unnecessary and harmful division has been set aside,” Norton said. “I am confident that Vince Gray will quickly heal any breaches that may have developed so that we can get on with the major issues that confront us in the city and in the Congress.”
Gray said that he was trying to rebuild the divided party after the primary.
“I am going to spend the next seven weeks between the primary and general election reaching out to people, especially those who may not have voted for me,” he said.
Though suspicions were raised that Fenty would consider running under a Republican or Independent ticket in the general election on Nov. 2, Fenty rejected the idea.
“I’ve had my turn, being a public servant and elected representative. For a quarter of my life I’ve been doing it, more than half my adult life. I feel that’s a great run,” Fenty said in his concession speech.
Fenty’s supporters pointed to his series of accomplishments while mayor. Homicide rates have gone down during Fenty’s tenure as mayor, according to The Washington Post.
Fenty’s biggest reform, however, occurred in education with his appointment of Michelle Rhee, chancellor of the D.C. school system. Rhee fired over a hundred teachers and principals who failed to meet standardized test score standards, a popular decision among many education reformers, but a polarizing one for some citizens of Washington, D.C. Gray has not clarified if he will keep Rhee as chancellor.
“We’re going to prove that collaboration and reform are not mutually exclusive. We will continue to aggressively reform our schools. We’re going to invest in getting District residents back to work, and we’re going to fight crime on every block and ensure our families are safe and feel safe in every neighborhood,” Gray wrote, in his final blog entry on his campaign website.”

Statistics show that business in the Georgetown area is down, with many stores closing and others turning significantly less profit. But while Georgetown is not immune to the recession, owners and retailers have hope that business will pick up with students’ return to campus.
The Georgetown area had a net loss of 13 stores in 2009. Restaurant tax receipts for a single month in 2007 were almost as much as those for the whole first half of the year 2010.
“All business has been slow this year,” said Mauricio Sepulveda, co-owner of Los Cuates, a Mexican restaurant on Wisconsin Avenue that is popular among students. “We’re still doing OK, but not great compared to other years.”
Sepulveda added that prices of food have increased, increasing financial challenges for local restaurants. “I don’t want to raise my prices, I want to keep them low for students, but I may have to,” he said. “Lots of students used to come in on Friday and Saturday nights. Now we hardly see any.”
With campus’s proximity to businesses in the area, Georgetown students can make or break a business’s year. Even restaurants that still attract high numbers of students are suffering.
“Prices have gotten higher this year and some students are complaining,” said Velter Valenzuela, assistant manager at Qdoba on M Street. “The recession is a little bit of a problem, because people want to spend less money. Sometimes two people will come in and share one burrito.”
Despite the numbers, not all the trends are negative in Georgetown.
“Retailers are telling us that it has been tough in the recession but they’re feeling optimistic about the future,” said Nancy Miyahira, marketing director of the Georgetown Business Improvement District. “Definitely things are trending well. Since 2009, things have flipped. A lot of those places that were vacant last year you now see are slated to be filled this fall or next spring.”
Though 24 businesses have closed or are slated to close this year, the Georgetown neighborhood is looking to gain 39 new stores by the end of December, according to Miyahira.
“Our retailers are feeling like there’s energy in the neighborhood for retail again,” she said.
Urban Outfitters, which plans many of its events around the university schedule, has seen profits boosted in the past several years, according to Brynn Delcolli, manager at the trendy retailer.
“We have girls who come in three times a week, who know our shipment days,” she said. “We are consistently busy with students.”
The same is true even for local independent stores like Annie Creamcheese, a secondhand shop on M Street.
“Students and locals are extremely loyal,” said Buu Linh Topolsky, Annie Creamcheese’s manager. “Business has been good, there is nothing daunting about the economic atmosphere.”
Sweetgreen, which has seen profits increase 75 percent since the beginning of the year, reported a mixed year.
“Business was not as good as it is now that students are back,” said Alberto Hernandez, supervisor at Sweetgreen. “They are very loyal, and they come back every year.”
Smiling, he added, “And they always bring new students with them.”

As students in an Intercultual Center lecture room listened to professor Carol Dover examine the Christian framework of “Laüstic,” a medieval narrative poem by the Breton poet Marie de France, many eyes were busy scanning the syllabus for the date of the reading assignments from their favorite novelist: J.K. Rowling.
The course, named “Knights of Old and Harry Potter,” provides context for the wildly popular fiction series by examining Rowling’s source material.
Georgetown faculty have perennially made attempts to integrate popular culture into course curricula. Ask philosophy professor Linda Wetzel, who for 10 years has used “Star Trek” to illustrate concepts in metaphysics. A new addition to the English department’s course roster, “Zombies!” examines why the undead are scary to society.
“You could take any figure to talk about cultural issues and that’s what happens in a literature class,” Nathaniel Rivers, the class’s professor, said. “The zombies seem to create a bigger sense of urgency to talk about infrastructure and law and justice.”
The reading list for Rivers’ class also features “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,” which imagines zombies in Victorian England. Zombies, called “unmentionables” in the book, show up at parties uninvited and improperly dressed, Rivers said.
“Anything you can do to get students invested will improve the pedagogy,” Rivers said. But when students enter the class too familiar with source material, Rivers exercises caution. “They can’t achieve critical distance. That’s always the risk with classes that look at pop culture.”
The idea for Dover’s began when she received the Harry Potter novels as a gift in 2002.
For Chelsea Woodard (MSB ’13), analyzing the story of what goes into the beloved Harry Potter series has led to a stimulating class experience.
“When I find deeper meaning, it’s more interesting and more complex than just the book I read when in middle school,” she said.
any of the issues that pervade the novels, like friendship and growing up, have deep medieval roots, Dover said. The Breton lais or narrative poems typically with a medieval, romantic, chivalrous focus, illustrate different types of love, including friendship.
Thus, Dover asks readers of “Harry Potter” to reconsider their criticism of the series epilogue, when Harry and friends are described as parents content with the simple life.
“[The main characters] are doing what they should be doing. They’re remaining true to themselves. They’re all friends,” she said.
Even with connections to the Middle Ages, interpretations of the best-selling series are not bound to medieval lore, according to Dover. The character of Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, for example, alludes to a 19th-century Merlin character, not a medieval Merlin.
For Wetzel, the distinct pop culture link to “Star Trek” in her class helps students overcome the most abstract conceptual hurdles. Wetzel screens an episode every semester involving time travel, which leads into readings about different theories of time.
“You give them a coherent story, and they can see it,” Wetzel said.
It also helps students face conceptual questions like the relationship between soul and body, she said. She is less interested in “Star Trek’s” popularity than in its potential as a teaching aid.
“`Star Wars,’ on the other hand, is not philosophical. It’s all action with weird creatures and great bar scenes,” Wetzel said.
Wetzel’s course, now in its 10th year, had 25 students on the waiting list.”

Students in Study of the Arab World or Theorizing Culture and Politics this semester will go where few professors have allowed them to go before.
Since the rise of the online, community-based encyclopedia Wikipedia, professors have warned against using the sometimes unreliable website as a source for academic research. But Professor Rochelle Davis, assistant professor of Arab Culture and Society at Georgetown, have integrated the Wiki-phenomenon into the curricula of both these classes.
Davis is one of nine public policy professors from prominent universities who have partnered with the Wikimedia Foundation to incorporate the user-generated encyclopedia into their curriculum. Beginning this semester, Davis plans to have students write and edit Wikipedia entries as an opportunity for them to share their expertise with the online community.
In an interview with THE HOYA, Davis described Wikipedia as a social phenomenon, saying that, as an anthropologist, the social aspect of the site sold her.
“I’m tired of my grad students saying, `All we ever do is critique and discuss and deconstruct.’ I’m going to make them create something that’s not just a thing for me to read, it’s going to go out into the community,” Davis told Inside Higher Ed, an online publication based in Washington, D.C.
After the initial publication of their entries, Davis’ students will be required to check up on their articles periodically, eventually writing a reflection paper on how their content was received and shaped.
Professor Davis made it clear that the aim of the assignment is to have her students researching and writing for Wikipedia, not simply reading its entries.
“I’m not assigning students to read Wikipedia; some of the interviews seemed to have missed that. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. I wouldn’t assign my students to read it, just like I wouldn’t assign them Britannica, ” she said.
Instead, Davis said that the Wikipedia assignment is meant to give students a chance to write an “academic review” or a fact-based description for the website, which will help them to construct an academic argument in a more formal research paper.
Professors and administrators have traditionally frowned upon the use Wikipedia in the academic world. In 2007, the history department at Middlebury College banned Wikipedia citations in any papers or other academic work. Then-Department Chair Don Wyatt described the opinion of many in academia in an interview with Inside Higher Ed.
“As educators, we are in the business of reducing the dissemination of misinformation. Though Wikipedia may have some value, particularly from the value of leading students to citable sources, it is not itself an appropriate source for citation,” he said. “

With its selection as the only testing site in D.C. for Toyota’s first-generation Prius Plug-in Hybrid vehicles, the university will now offer faculty members a spin in one of the two eco-friendly cars.
The vehicles, which use a combination of electric and hybrid technologies, will be on loan to the university for at least a year, with the possibility that Toyota may extend the program for a second year.
Beginning in October, faculty members will be able to apply to test-drive the PHVs for three-month intervals. Drivers will be allowed to park in two newly installed electronic car-charging stations in the garage beneath the LEED-certified Rafik B. Hariri Building.
The testing is part of an international research initiative by Toyota and ZEV Technologies, Inc. and will be managed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Clean Cities Project. Dashboard data will be streamed directly to the program website so that consumers can track the vehicles’ performance.
The university is the first testing location in the Washington, D.C. area, having been chosen over other organizations, including the Washington Nationals. Toyota has distributed 600 PHVs worldwide.
According to Audrey Stewart of the Office of Sustainability, the test-driving will also aid the university as it tackles its renewable energies agenda.
“By participating in this program, Georgetown will better understand what types of policies and infrastructure we will need in order to support the emerging use of cleaner cars by our faculty, staff, visitors and our fleet, ” she said in an interview.
Karen Frank, vice president for university facilities and student housing, said in a press release that the Prius PHVs are both easy to charge and to drive. The vehicles operate on electric power for the first 13 miles of driving at speeds of up to 62 miles per hour before converting to standard Prius hybrid technology.
“Essentially, the car can be charged in any three-prong 110V outlet. The vehicles charge in about three hours from a 110V outlet, and about 1.5 hours in a 220V outlet,” Stewart said.
The key element of the Prius PHV is the use of the high-output lithium ion battery, which is best known for its use in powering cell phones. Toyota claims that the battery “ensures strong, seamless acceleration up to highway speeds of more than 60 [miles per hour] on electric-only power.”
Students responded to the new program favorably, though some were surprised at how few miles the car will operate on electricity.
“I think it’s a step in the right direction,” Victoria Ngare (SFS ’12) said. “If this is the best technology out there, then I am glad Georgetown is embracing it.”
“Still,” she added, “I’m actually kind of stunned at how inefficient the car sounds. Thirteen miles on electricity really isn’t that much.”

In Newsweek Magazine’s newly released set of college rankings, Georgetown placed in the top 25 in four categories, under both conventional and unorthodox criteria.
In the rankings, redesigned this year by Newsweek, Georgetown ranked eighth in the list of best schools for future powerbrokers, 14th among urban schools, 16th among schools for brainiacs, 23rd in diversity and 24th in gay-friendliness.
“Its melting-pot hometown of Washington, D.C., might contribute to the school’s all-inclusive atmosphere,” Newsweek wrote.
Despite these rankings, the university was not on the list of the 25 most desirable schools, which included Ivy League schools, three military academies and numerous liberal arts colleges.
Georgetown’s many Rhodes Scholars influenced Newsweek’s decision to place the university as No. 16 for brainiacs. Alumni have also included 20 members of the House, six members of the Senate, a Fortune 100 CEO and two U.S. presidents.
To measure diversity, Newsweek said its system examined ethnicity, geographic origin, economic status, gender and sexual orientation. The magazine also noted geographic origin both within the United States and throughout the world.
Newsweek had previously posted rankings in 2007 and 2008, with Georgetown designated in 2008 as one of its “hottest big-city schools.” The magazine also recognized Georgetown’s status as the nation’s oldest Catholic university.”

History professors and scholars from the university and King’s College London convened in Copley Formal Lounge for a two-day, first-of-its-kind Global History forum, “Empires and Globalizations in the Making of the Modern World” this Thursday and Friday.
Organized by professor John Tutino, director of the Georgetown Institute for Global History, with the support of Paul Readman, Jim Bjork and Jan Palmowski at King’s College, this forum marks the inauguration of the Georgetown University-King’s College London Joint Master’s Degree Program in Global History.
The master’s program, which a small number of students are beginning this fall, consists of one year at Georgetown and one at King’s College London and gives students the opportunity to study with scholars from King’s College renowned for their work in the history of Europe and its empires, as well as professors at Georgetown regarded for their historical knowledge of Latin America, the Middle East, East Asia and U.S. history. The structure of the program encourages a globally oriented study of history.
It is in this spirit that this week’s Global History Forum was conceived.
“This is the sort of grand, comparative, historical perspective that our new, transatlantic community of scholars and students hope to develop in the context of our partnership,” Roshwald said of the forum.
The forum consisted of four two-hour sessions over the course of two days. Each session was made up of two lectures by faculty members followed by an open discussion led by a professor.
Beginning with “Atlantic Empires – and Beyond” and ending with “The End of Empires?” each session progressed chronologically and explored an empire and its influence on both its contemporaries and the modern world.
In his keynote address on Thursday, Richard Drayton highlighted the innate global and interdependent quality of history, using Europe as an example. While Europe’s imperialistic history is often explored from a nationalistic standpoint – French colonization, British imperialism – he argued that past empires were borne and maintained not by countries individually, but rather as a kind of collaboration of European nations and later the United States. This collaboration, according to Drayton, marked the beginning of globalization.
Yet, as professor Tutino expressed, the forum was not intended to be just a conversation among scholars. Rather, it was intended to be a presentation of scholarly work among academics and students, and all were encouraged to chime in for the discussion.
“Students should not come silent. Raise the questions. There is an enormous amount to be gained by entering into the life of the community,” Tutino said.
Students – graduates and undergraduates – sat alongside their professors in Copley Formal Lounge to participate in and listen to the christening of the new joint master’s program.
“Today is a big day for us,” said Eric Gettig, a Georgetown graduate student in history, who attended the program. “This global, transnational approach is something that means a lot to me. It is one way that the study of history is changing.”
The forum will continue at King’s College London in June when professors from both universities have had time to confer with one another and to revise their papers.”

When students think of Georgetown alumni, they often focus on the Bill Clintons and the Bradley Coopers. But the 1634 Society, a new student group descended from the university’s Office of Advancement and the Senior Class Fund, tries to introduce students to networking and reaching beyond the Hilltop during their time on campus.
The society, which held its first meeting last Friday after months of planning, hopes to involve students in all the career-building opportunities that Georgetown’s alumni network offers – before they become alumni themselves.
“If you’re in the habit of getting involved with these things as a student, when you’re already on campus once you graduate, it’s going to be second nature,” said 1634 Society Co-Chair Kirsten Hardy (SFS ’11), who also serves as co-chair of the Class of 2011 Fund.
The group had its genesis in the Office of Advancement, which handles alumni relations and fundraising. The office, along with partners like the Georgetown University Alumni Association and the Career Education Center, has long focused on connecting students with alumni. Their goals include helping students enter professional networks, enabling alumni to reconnect with their university and eventually tapping into the community for donations.
But despite years of networking events and programs like the Discovery Initiative, which hires around 50 students a year to interview alumni for the Office of Advancement, many in the office still want to reach more students earlier in their time at Georgetown.
Quinn Portfolio (COL ’11), co-chair of both the 1634 Society and the 2011 Fund along with Hardy, highlighted the disconnect she often sees between students and the resources meant to serve them. She cited the Career Education Center’s upcoming fall career fair.
“I would guess that maybe 20 percent of the [senior] class knows about [the fair],” she said. She added, “I feel like most of my friends say, `I don’t know how to find a job, I don’t know how to network,’ but in reality it’s all there.”
The 1634 Society’s mission is to spread that knowledge. “[We’ll have] fun events that we get people to come to and enjoy themselves. But at the same time, our main focus is basically to convey what Georgetown has to offer,” Portfolio said.
Still, the group isn’t ignoring the possible financial benefits to the university. For participating students, Hardy said membership in the 1634 Society will be a reward for donating to the university – in any amount – although the Society will focus on promoting pre-existing events already open to all students.
The two functions of the organizations are inseparable, according to Sacha Ostern (SFS ’07), assistant director of advancement who was closely involved in the creation of the Society.
“Yes, philanthropy is important. Fundraising keeps our lights on, and even has an impact on our rankings,” he said. “But philanthropy and fundraising are the products of successful engagement.”
That commitment to engaging students with the serious side of Georgetown community extends to the leadership of the 1634 Society. “I don’t think you’ll find a group in the country that’s like this, and if you did, it’s not run by students,” said Ben Jarrett, assistant director of advancement and a close adviser to Hardy and Portfolio. “I think it says a lot about Georgetown that they trust students to run something that’s so important.”
Portfolio highlighted the benefits of student leadership. “[Students] know what kind of events they would want to go to, what things are important to them, what services they want to be available to them. Who better to know that than the students?”
The group’s two August email announcements about leadership posts saw a strong response. Fifteen seniors and 38 students from other classes have joined.
“The number of people that we’ve had respond to our application and be generally really excited about what we’re doing has been a huge accomplishment,” Hardy said.
And maybe that excitement, channeled through the 1634 Society, will actually help alleviate a perennial student worry.
“It’s an unfortunate reality,” Jarrett said. “You’re a senior, you have to come back [from summer], and all of sudden, it’s like, `Oh, my god, I need a job.’ It kind of hits you all at once . And I think that if you were a first year student and came to Georgetown, and got involved in this … you’re already three years ahead of where you were.”

Honored with the largest donation in university history, the Medical Center received $87 million in research funding this June.
The donation, which surpassed the previous largest gift of $75 million, given by Robert McDevitt (CAS ’40) in December 2008, is a gift from Virginia Toulmin, who died in June after managing her late husband’s charitable trust for over 40 years. Toulmin’s husband, Harry Toulmin, died in 1965, leaving a $1.2 million trust in his wife’s control according to a press release.
Although Mr. Toulmin did not attend Georgetown, his grandfather, Warwick Evans, was the first student to graduate from the School of Medicine in the Class of 1852 and then worked at the School of Medicine as an anatomy professor.
“Harry really worshiped his grandfather, who was this great man – successful physician and prominent Washington figure,” Virginia Toulmin said in a 1997 interview with the university.
“Harry was a strong believer in educational institutions, and even though he didn’t graduate from Georgetown, Harry loved his grandfather and his grandfather loved Georgetown,” she said.
rs. Toulmin maintained an active presence in the university community, serving on the board of regents and on the board of visitors for the School of Nursing and Health Studies.
In the 1997 interview, she said she was elated knowing Georgetown would eventually receive the trust money as a donation.
The money will be used to fund the Warwick Evans and Mary Mason Washington Evans Medical Research Endowment, supporting research at the Medical Center.
Howard Federoff, executive dean of the School of Medicine, could not be reached for comment.”
