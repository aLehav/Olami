Georgetown’s endowment reached a record high of $1.162 billion for fiscal year 2011, demonstrating growth of 15.4 percent from last year’s value.
The increase also marks a jump in the endowment’s growth rate from last year, which stood at 12.8 percent.
This growth is mainly the result of returns to university investments, which came in at a rate of 16.8 percent, according to the annual report of Georgetown’s fiscal operations.
Georgetown’s investments are managed by the university’s investment office through the pooled part of the endowment consisting of unrestricted gifts. The total endowment also includes non-discretionary assets that often have an intended purpose.
The ranking of the university’s endowment in comparison to other institutions by the National Association of College and University Business Owners for 2011 is not yet available.
$66.5 million of the endowment’s pooled funds were distributed this year.
“The purpose of the distribution policy is to strike a balance between current spending and endowment growth (and thus future spending),” according to the report.
The distribution of endowment funds was countered by contributions totaling $59.5 million. Overall, the university received $207 million in cash gifts and $132.7 million in future commitments.
