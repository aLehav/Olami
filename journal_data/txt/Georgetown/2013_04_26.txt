While Georgetown’s adjunct professors are in the midst of voting on unionization, the organization seeking to represent them, Service Employees International Union, is gearing up to target higher education workers in other metropolitan areas.
Following its success galvanizing adjuncts to unionize at Montgomery College in Rockville, Md., and American University and The George Washington University in Washington, D.C., the labor union is now extending its efforts to Boston.
SEIU’s modus operandi is to target colleges and universities in a specific urban area to induce a domino effect across the city by pressuring neighbors to follow suit in unionizing.
“The trends in higher education [are] now 70 percent of faculty are off the tenure track and over half are part-time,” SEIU Communications Director Avril Smith said. “These trends are happening across the country, but Boston is a leading market in higher education.”
At Georgetown, SEIU Local 500 filed for elections on March 23 and ballots were mailed out to eligible faculty members on April 12, according to SEIU Local 500 Communications Director Christopher Honey.
The National Labor Relations Board, which governs voting, will tally the votes May 3. Georgetown’s adjuncts will become unionized if the majority of adjuncts who vote approve. Provost Robert Groves stated in a letter March 26 that the university encouraged faculty members to vote and would remain neutral.
“I, for one, am hopeful about unionization,” Honey said.
To attract professors, Adjunct Action, a project of SEIU, held a symposium with over 100 adjunct faculty members from over 20 Boston campuses, including Boston College and the University of Massachusetts Lowell, on April 13. Due to the proliferation of colleges and universities in the area, Smith said that she believes Boston can serve as an example for other areas.
“[Conditions do not] really vary much from campus to campus or city to city,” Smith said.
According to The Chronicle for Higher Education, the majority of adjuncts in Boston’s public institutions of higher education are involved in collective bargaining units. Such efforts on private campuses, however, have previously failed to make an impact.
Smith described the Boston movement as being in its preliminary stages.
“The next step is forming organizing committees both on the campuses where adjunct faculty are most interested in moving forward and also across the metropolitan area,” Smith said.
SEIU Organizing Coordination and Adjunct Action Campaign Director Todd Ricker spoke of a “broad net” approach to this particular metropolitan campaign.
“There are several campuses where we are finding a lot of heat,” Ricker said. “We have been speaking with faculty members face-to-face since early this year. Campus-by-campus, the adjunct and non-tenure track faculty at each are deciding when the time is right to begin election campaigns for their own unions.”
SEIU is just one of several unions that focuses on labor rights in higher education. Adjuncts Come Together-United Auto Workers represents adjuncts at New York University and the New School in New York City. The American Association of University Professors, National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers also advocate for professors’ rights and include divisions for adjuncts.
“The issues in the U.S. higher-ed system are so deep and so pervasive that we recognize it will take more than just one organization to fix it,” Ricker said.
Los Angeles is also considered a potential target for SEIU, but efforts are in their infancy, and Ricker stressed that many cities across the country are eligible for SEIU’s focus in its next campaign.

While a survey released by the ACT on April 17 found that few college educators perceived high school graduates to be academically prepared for college, Georgetown professors generally found incoming freshmen ready for the rigor of university academics.
According to the survey, 89 percent of high school educators reported their graduates to be adequately prepared upon graduation, while only 26 percent of college educators believed college freshmen to be ready for college-level work.
In particular, however, educators at all levels expressed concern about students’ reading comprehension skills, with 75 percent of high school teachers reporting that high school students graduate with grade-school level abilities.
“College requires more critical analysis and critical thinking than high school, and everyone has to adjust,” Georgetown College Dean Chester Gillis said.
Nevertheless, School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster, who has taught multiple freshman seminars, said that incoming Georgetown students have generally adjusted adequately.
“I would say that students are pretty well prepared for college,” Lancaster said. “They are usually able to write essays well, think clearly, are ready to work hard and are, of course, smart.”
Lancaster, however, said that students often lack the ability to find appropriate source materials.
“Wikipedia and … superficial blogs on the Internet are just not enough for a serious, well-researched essay or paper,” Lancaster said.
To develop writing skills and other key academic skills, all four Georgetown schools offer or require writing-intensive seminars for incoming freshmen.
“I am less concerned with content than I am with the methodology and exposure of recent scholarship, which is what I want the faculty to model,” Gillis said.
Overall, Gillis said that due to the survey’s wide range, it was inapplicable to Georgetown students.
“The caliber of student that we recruit and the schools with which we compete do get the best high school students,” Gillis said. “The survey is probably testing across the board, and it’s probably not a fair playing field to compare that to Georgetown.”
Lancaster agreed that the university’s incoming students seem well prepared to handle the demanding Georgetown workload.
“Some students have an extraordinarily mature intelligence and can do professional-quality work from the get go which is always amazing to me,” Lancaster said.
While educators found students’ writing abilities to be most lacking, students said the most difficult part of the transition to college was the heavy workload.
“I felt prepared academically as a freshman in part because I was so apprehensive about the workload that I put a great deal of work in and did better first semester than I did any semester thereafter,” Galen Hiltbrand (COL ’15) said. “I came from a school that really emphasized college preparation.”
Ebere Anokute (COL ’15) agreed, adding that the work itself was not very difficult.
“The hardest part I found was not the material itself but learning how to discern from the material what is most pertinent and what is less important,” Anokute said.
On the other hand, Kyra Hanlon (SFS ’16) said that while her high school had prepared her for the rigor of college, she felt unprepared for the style of university classes.
“In high school we had a lot of daily homework, the teachers would kind of ride you and the essays were shorter, and here at college it’s more about independent reading time and essay writing,” Hanlon said.

As the academic year draws to a close, students are in the process of electing their respective schools’ academic council representatives for next year. Though Georgetown College’s elections are ongoing through Monday, the School of Foreign Service, McDonough School of Business and School of Nursing & Health Studies elected representatives last week.
Across all four schools, the top agenda items for incoming and outgoing academic councils are increasing transparency and communication in their positions as liaisons between the deans’ offices and students.
Incoming SFS Academic Council President Kyle Zhu (SFS ’14), who ran unopposed, said he hopes to give SFS students a greater say in the formation of their curriculum and academic life. According to Zhu, the new SFS Academic Council will work to increase communication with the students through a regular newsletter and weekly open houses.
“I wanted to make sure that SFS students know where to access resources for research, internships and other academic passions that I never knew about until much later at Georgetown,” Zhu said.
For example, Zhu plans to lobby for access to classes in the McDonough School of Business.
“Many SFS students want to take these classes but are currently barred from taking them and instead can only take a watered-down version for non-MSB students,” Zhu said. “The inability of SFS students to obtain a minor also makes it difficult to access certain classes and resources from academic departments at Georgetown.”
The SFSAC succeeded in instituting a joint introductory macro- and microeconomics course this year, a focus of outgoing SFSAC President Jon Askonas (SFS ’13).
College Academic Council Vice President Kamil Lupicki (COL ’14), who is running for CAC president, said he hopes to increase interschool collaboration, something he thinks has fallen by the wayside.
“Over the past academic year, there hasn’t been that much dialogue between the four academic councils, though I do hope that it can return to prior levels over the course of next semester,” he said.
Lupicki highlighted the multiple CAC events this year that were created to increase communication between students and deans, including an ice cream social this past Wednesday.
“We found that for many upperclassmen, they stopped using the resources available through the Dean’s Office after sophomore year,” Lupicki said. “Obviously, this is partly because, for juniors and seniors, they have a better idea as to what they will focus on in terms of studies, but we definitely wanted to reopen those lines of communication between deans and students.”
This year, the CAC worked to establish a printing plan automatically included in tuition, similar to the models for MSB and NHS students. According to Lupicki, while the council has shown a proposal to the university administration, officials are still not ready to move on it.
Current MSB Academic Council member Patrick Moore (MSB ’15) reflected on the past year’s efforts to increase transparency about course requirements.
“We really put an emphasis on trying to clear up requirements for majors for underclassmen along with normal course requirements for all MSB students,” Moore said, specifically mentioning a majors fair for freshmen held earlier this year.
MSB Academic Council elections concluded April 19, with Alana Magli (MSB ’14) succeeding Nikhil Lakhanpal (MSB ’13) as president.
Outgoing NHS Academic Council Co-Chairs Scott Wisniewski (NHS ’13) and Katie Dunn (NHS ’13) have focused on increased faculty-student interaction this year.
They also succeeded in their efforts to reintroduce philanthropy to the council’s agenda by fundraising to support St. Aloysius Gonzaga, a Jesuit school for AIDS orphans in Kenya.
Antonia Kopp (NHS ’14) and Jamie Schlarbaum (NHS ’15), who were elected NHS Academic Council co-presidents March 5, said that continuing these philanthropic efforts was a main priority of theirs for the upcoming year. The rest of the NHS Academic Council was elected on April 19. They are the first co-chairs to be elected at such an early date in an effort to facilitate a smoother transition under the leadership of their outgoing counterparts.
“It was really helpful to be able to have this period where we could still look to Scottie and Katie,” Schlarbaum said. “They’ve been so accessible both inside of meetings and out and have always shown that not only is this job extremely important to the school, but it’s also a lot of fun.”

The Hoya Gateway program will launch May 6, connecting students and alumni for one-on-one advice, informational interviews and resume reviews.
After a year and a half of pilot programs, the official launch will include alumni and students in Chicago, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, New York City and San Francisco this summer. All students, however, will have the opportunity to participate on campus during the academic year.
According to Associate Director of Alumni Career Services Whitney Pezza, Jeff Chapski (MSB ’91), a member of the Georgetown Alumni Association Board of Governors, envisioned Hoya Gateway more than two years ago.
“It was obvious from day one that our alumni are tremendously passionate about Georgetown and especially interested in connecting with students,” Pezza wrote in an email. “Hoya Gateway is what the Georgetown Alumni Association is all about — maintaining a connection between students and alumni in order to both foster the Georgetown spirit and continue to build relationships within the broader Georgetown community.”
Hoya Gateway features alumni in an array of fields including entertainment and media, finance, government, health and medicine and technology. Represented companies include Deloitte, Skadden, JP Morgan Chase, Major League Baseball and various nonprofit and business endeavors.
“It’s important to us that we have rising stars as well as established professionals in order to provide students with a wide range of expertise,” Pezza wrote.
Hoya Gateway student ambassador Gabrielle Gold (COL ’14) met with Netflix Social Media Director Eric Pallotta (MSB ’07) in Los Angeles, this past winter break. Gold said that he proved to be a good resource.
“Even if you’re unsure about what you want to do or how you’re going to fit into postgrad life, it’s comforting to know Georgetown alums are there to help you, to support you and to guide you on your way,” Gold said.
Chairman of the 1634 Society and student governor on the Georgetown University Alumni Association’s Board of Governors Bryan Satterly (SFS ’13) said that the program helped him determine his career path by allowing him to get a sense of different industries.
“I got to meet and network with people in the career field I’m going into — finance — so that was a huge help when I was looking for jobs and trying to figure out what I wanted,” Satterly said.
Although the 1634 Society and Hoya Gateway both work to foster alumni connections with Georgetown, the two orient toward different aims. The 1634 Society focuses primarily on keeping alumni in touch with the university and to encourage them to give back, such as educating alumni about the Campaign for Georgetown. On the other hand, Hoya Gateway specifically allows alumni to become mentors to current students, advising them on job opportunities and the working world.
Pezza said he envisioned that the gateway would expand domestically and internationally, in addition to incorporating technology.
“One long-term goal is that every Georgetown student will meet with an alumnus one-on-one through Hoya Gateway for a meaningful, career-related conversation before graduation,” Pezza wrote.
Participant Devon George (MSB ’01), who is also involved in the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Alliance, said that he was excited about the rate of alumni participation.
“I’ve never seen so many Hoyas get excited to help so many undergraduate Hoyas,” George said. “Usually people don’t have time, or they aren’t available or they aren’t sure they understand it. In my experience so far, this is the most successful alumni initiative to bring together alumni and undergraduates for mentoring opportunities.”

A group of international students studying science and mathematics met with Brenda Dann-Messier, U.S. assistant secretary for vocational and adult education, last week to advocate for an immigration reform proposal that may soon come before the Senate.
Georgetown University Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming (FLL ’72), who has taken part in some of the initial discussions about the reform proposal, said he organized the meeting to give students the chance to personally influence the political debate.
“Most importantly, we wanted an opportunity for these students to highlight the kinds of things they are studying and researching and what they would like to do if they were able to stay in the U.S.,” Fleming said.
The proposal, which was developed by a bipartisan group of senators known as the Gang of Eight has the potential to benefit Georgetown students seeking to either acquire citizenship or pursue careers in the sciences in the United States after graduation, and would affect the status of the Dream Act and the H1B visa program.
“The version of the Dream Act that is in this bill is one of the better versions that has existed over recent years,” Fleming said. “Before, when the legislature was trying to get it passed as a standalone measure, they had tightened it up and made it a little less generous to those who would potentially receive citizenship.”
According to Fleming, the Gang of Eight’s proposal would immediately increase the annual quota of student visas for those in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, fields, from 65,000 to 110,000. The quota would then increase by up to 10,000 each year until reaching an overall annual cap of 180,000.
Another change that would benefit some international students, Fleming said, would be the approval of what are called dual-intent visas, which would allow students to get a visa without proving that they intend to return home after they finish their studies. According to Fleming, acquiring the necessary proof can be difficult.
“If the Gang of 8 bill succeeds in passing, you would have the right to decide that you’d like to stay in the United States and not have to provide sufficient evidence of your intent to leave like you do now,” Fleming said. “And sometimes proof of that intent is not an easy proposition.”
As of now, the graduate studies program at Georgetown hosts 180 students on STEM visas. Citing both practical and financial reasons, many of the STEM students who attended last Friday’s discussion expressed their desire to stay in the country after they graduate, when their STEM visas are set to expire.
A graduate student from Benin who is studying biochemistry and molecular biology said that he would feel alienated both at home and at the workplace should he be compelled to return to his native country after Georgetown. He declined to provide his name because he did not want to hurt his chances of getting a visa.
“I do have friends over there,” the student said. “I was in the top 10 students in the entire country and I’ve gone back several times knowing that there’s no certainty that I can get an extension on my visa after graduation. Each time I’ve done this, in many ways, I was a foreigner in my own country. I don’t know what I would do there to fully actualize the benefit of what I’ve learned.”
In addition to students and faculty, attendees included Kathy Bellows, director of the Office for International Programs and Rachel Rubin, director of International Student and Scholar Services.
Although the immigration reform bill has not passed the Senate Judiciary Committee yet, Fleming said that lawmakers recognize that the timeframe they have to work on this issue could be very limited. He added that critics of the bill now have a new piece of evidence to use to their advantage in the wake of the discovery that two immigrants from Chechnya were responsible for last week’s bombings at the Boston Marathon.
“When it became clear that the two suspects were Chechen, Sen. Chuck Grassley [R-Iowa], for instance, came out and said we need to slow this process down,” Fleming said.
However, Fleming said that he remains tentatively hopeful about the bill’s future.
“The Gang of Eight have decided to stick together on the two core aspects of the bill, namely the Dream Act and STEM visa reform, and to resist amendments to those two provisions,” Fleming said.
Many of the students said that a few words spoken by professor Elliot Crooke during the meeting last Friday epitomized their viewpoint.
“Science has no borders,” Crooke said.

Although a sizeable number of students in off-campus housing have yet to be pushed back on campus because of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, some are being shifted from university-owned townhouses to dormitories.
Because 18 Magis Row townhouses on 36th Street will be converted this summer from upperclassman housing to administrative offices and faculty and graduate housing, fewer apartments were available to underclassmen in this year’s housing lotteries.
While 26 apartments in Henle Village were available last year to rising sophomores in the housing lottery, this year only seven groups of sophomores were able to secure Henle apartments. Henle will absorb many of the upperclassmen who would usually have been housed in townhouses.
The university, however, will create 65 more beds on campus before the 2013-2014 academic year begins, a requirement of the campus plan agreement.
According to Associate Vice President of University Facilities and Student Housing Jonalyn Ware Greene, the additional student beds will be created by converting 40 double rooms to triple rooms in New South and Southwest Quad, modifying staff apartments and offices in Henle and Alumni Square for student use, and adding beds to two of the townhouses still available to students.
Some rising sophomores lamented that because of these changes, lottery numbers that would have them in the range of securing a Henle last year only got them a room in the Southwest Quad or Copley Hall this year. Similarly, some rising sophomores whose lottery number would have allowed them to get a room in Southwest Quad last year instead were awarded housing in LXR or Village C East during this year’s housing selection.
Alisha Dua (COL ’16) said she understands that the university must comply with the zoning order, but does not think that it is fair to push more sophomores into LXR next year.
“It is definitely disheartening that more sophomores are being moved off-campus, while [upperclassmen] are being moved back into Henle,” Dua said.
Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Chair Ron Lewis said he perceives the change as a step toward better relations between the Georgetown neighborhood and students. Lewis said this transition is a good step toward achieving the campus plan goal of housing 90 percent of undergraduate students on campus by 2025.
“Because the Magis Row houses on 36th are being turned into faculty and grad student housing and then, ultimately, faculty housing and administrative offices, that will help with the plan to put more of the housing on campus,” Lewis said.
Lewis mentioned that the increased number of student beds in existing dorms is only a temporary solution until new student residencies are built.
“It is part of the plan and, by fall 2015, the dorms will be ready. They are working on it,” Lewis stated.
In March, the university proposed building a new residence hall across from Reiss Science Building to replace an earlier plan that would have repurposed the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center.
Other less likely proposals still on the table include expanding Henle Village or Southwest Quad, purchasing the empty Kober-Cogan Building — which has been vacant since May 2010 because of hazardous levels of mold following a steam leak — from MedStar Georgetown University Hospital or constructing dorms on the parking lot by McDonough Gymnasium or on Harbin Terrace.

Georgetown students can now channel the Library of Congress without heading to Capitol Hill with the April 18 launch of the Digital Public Library of America, a free online library resource for the American public.
DPLA, funded through the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Arcadia Fund and a variety of government grants, contains over two million items, including library collections and archival collections from historical societies and museums. DPLA’s catalog contains photographs, manuscripts, books, sounds, moving images and more.
Among its partners are Harvard University, the New York Public Library and the Smithsonian Institution.
DPLA Assistant Director for Content Amy Rudersdorf stressed the difference between DPLA and subscription-based resources such as EBSCOhost, which the university uses. While sites like EBSCOhost consist of solely electronic books and journal entries, DPLA also features images and other multimedia content in addition to written text.
In addition, Rudersdorf said that DPLA should not be used merely as a search tool but can lend its software to other applications.
“We’re not just a place where you go to search in a box like Google but make the data available for folks who know how to use it through [application programming interface] to build programs and apps on top of it,” Rudersdorf said.
For example, one of the unique features of DPLA’s online database is its exhibits function. It allows users to sift through primary sources that relate to a specific topic, much as a museum exhibit features sources that pertain to a subject.
Rudersdorf expressed confidence that DPLA would appeal to a wide audience, citing the wide range of content available.
“It’s kind of grandiose to say that it’s meant for anyone who wants to use it, but it really is,” Rudersdorf said.
Despite said features, Associate University Librarian for Scholarly Resources and Services Sem Sutter said he did not think DPLA would change the way students access material online. Due to copyright laws, DPLA cannot include content published after 1964. Depending on specific provisions, some works published between 1873 and 1964 are also excluded.
“I don’t think it will have a huge effect because of the kind of material that’s in it,” Sutter said, “It doesn’t really duplicate, for example, current print books or journals, or for that matter, current e-books, current online journals.”
Theology professor Ariel Glucklich agreed and said he was unsure about DPLA’s potential impact on the student body.
“Here, students [already] have access to the online resources that our library has, in addition to other libraries in the network,” Glucklich said. “The biggest impact would be on people not enrolled in universities that don’t have that kind of access.”
In addition, Glucklich said that online services such as DPLA and EBSCOhost would not significantly affect traditional library usage.
“The thing about libraries is that most books are not available online yet,” Glucklich said. “You still have to go to the library and find the book, so whenever one needs a book, you’re still going to need the library,” Glucklich said.
Although Georgetown is not a current DPLA partner, Sutter said that Georgetown would consider participating in the future.
“It’s something we might look at eventually,” Sutter said. “It’s just launched.”
Specifically, Sutter said the university would focus on its own digitization project, Digital Georgetown, for the time being. Digital Georgetown digitizes student publications, faculty theses, dissertations and other content. It also features a digital lecture hall with podcasts and other streaming media.
According to Sutter, Digital Georgetown has similar aims to DPLA.
“It’s still a fairly young thing, and we’re trying to build content, but we might eventually be interested in sharing some of these things … with DPLA,” Sutter said.

The National Science Foundation awarded two current Georgetown students and two alumni 2013 graduate fellowships to pursue research in the sciences.
Fellows receive a $12,000 education allowance and a $30,000 stipend every year for three years, during which recipients can study at any research institution in the United States.
Fellowship applicants must submit a research proposal, summary of past research, personal essay and three letters of recommendation.
“The National Science Foundation is very concerned with advancing science but also with teaching and educating underrepresented minorities,” fellowship recipient Scott Miles, a first-year doctoral student in the Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience at Georgetown, said.
Miles plans to research the relationship between music and language learning in the human brain. He is currently conducting a study on underprivileged youth studying music at Washington, D.C.’s Duke Ellington School of the Arts.
“The idea is to study how brain structures change over time as you learn music and how that relates to how brain structures change as you learn a language,” he said.
Miles based his research on a study by Georgetown professor Michael Ullman, director of the Brain and Language Lab. Ullman’s research examined brain activity when people listened to music and language.
Miles said the award allows fellows the flexibility to choose their own course of study.
“It gives you a lot of freedom, and I appreciate that,” he said. “When I came into Georgetown I wasn’t sure if there was a path to do what I wanted to do.”
Vivienne Foroughirad (COL ’10), a research associate in the biology department, will use the fellowship to pursue a doctorate at Duke University.
“I’m planning to work on a couple of different projects, but they’re all centered on the evolution of social structure in cetaceans,” Foroughirad said.
She will primarily study the social culture of bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, off the coast of Western Australia, and focus on sponging and feeding behaviors. Her fellowship research will build on the work she’s already done that looked at how dolphin behavior was affected by tourism.
Foroughirad noted that the fellowship is competitive and said she is grateful that it gives her more options to choose a graduate school.
Derek Dangerfield (COL ’12), another award recipient, is currently conducting HIV research in Malaysia with a Fulbright fellowship.
“I am exploring sexual risk taking, particularly among men that have sex with men,” Dangerfield wrote in an email.
He will pursue his doctorate degree at the University of Southern California with the NSF fellowship.
“I intend to explore competing hypotheses examining the relative roles of perceived community-level disorder and violence versus the availability of antiretroviral treatment on the sexual risk-taking behavior among African-Americans,” Dangerfield wrote.

In another effort to promote on-campus student social life, Epicurean and Co. will be open 24 hours a day, six days a week beginning fall 2013, with a full bar open until 2 a.m. starting this summer.
Though the full restaurant now closes nightly at 10:30 p.m., limited food options will now be available after 11 p.m. The restaurant will close completely only from late Sunday night to early Monday morning.
Epicurean will also be open 24/7 from May 1 to May 19 this year in an effort to provide more study space during final exams.
According to Epicurean manager J.G. Yang, Epicurean owner Chang Wook Chon was considering lengthening the restaurant’s hours until 2 a.m. when the university approached him about staying open 24 hours.
“We had a plan to stay open until 2, and then the university asked if we could do this instead so the owner [said] yes,” Yang said.
Georgetown University Student Association President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said Epicurean’s extended hours were prompted by extensive conversations between GUSA, Associate Vice President of Auxiliary Services Margie Bryant and Chief Business Officer Deborah Morey.
Many of the details for Epicurean’s extended hours have yet to be worked out.
“Definitely we’ll keep open sandwich and pizza areas, and the bar will be open until 2 a.m.,” Yang said.
The extended bar hours will necessitate increased security for drinking-age enforcement.
“The dining area will be open for everyone, of course, but [the] bar area, that might be a little strict,” Yang said. “We have a plan to put some outdoor seating. Our owner has a plan to put an outdoor stage as well. Anyone who wants to play can schedule it with us.”
The announcement of the extension of Epicurean’s hours coincides with the recent announcement of Mason Inn owner Fritz Brogan (COL ’07, LAW ’10) as the operator of the Healey Family Student Center pub, set to open in fall 2014.
Despite the apparent similarities between the planned changes for Epicurean and the Healey Family Student Center pub, Yang said he does not see the two late-night, on-campus locations as competitors.
“I know they are going to open, but that’s next year,” Yang said. “I think we are in another area [of campus] so we might have different people come to us.”
Brogan agreed that the two businesses would not extensively overlap.
“To be honest, I don’t know much about Epicurean’s business model, but I think our concept will be different,” he said. “I don’t think they have a dance floor.”
Tisa, who pushed for the extended Epicurean hours, said the new hours would benefit both students and neighbors.
“We’ve been discussing ways to make university auxiliary services serve students better and fix a lot of problems we see with on-campus and off-campus relations,” he said, “The neighbors want us to have on-campus late night food options, because then we don’t have to walk through the neighborhood to go to Tuscany. Students want on-campus, late-night food options, so they don’t have to walk through the neighborhood to go to Tuscany. The administration is now in the position to make some changes so they can really accommodate that.”
In addition to extending Epicurean’s hours, the university will open Copley Formal Lounge and Riverside Lounge from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. during study days and final exams from May 1 to May 19.

Looking to close the gap between the hard sciences and the humanities, Maggie Axelrod (COL ’15) and Viggy Parr (COL ’15) founded Futures in Science and Humanities in December to explore the interdisciplinary nature of careers in the sciences.
After organizing a career fair with one of their professors, the founders also the co-presidents Axelod and Parr were inspired to establish FISH. The group focuses on sponsoring events and inviting speakers, including policymakers and environmentally sustainable company executives, to campus.
“FISH is committed to standing at the intersection of science and humanities, and bridging the gap between two disciplines that most people see as completely separate,” Parr said. “We want to show students interested in science that you can truly do pretty much anything with a science degree. We also want students of other majors to see how their interests can intersect with science in interesting and innovative ways.”
Axelrod said that the club is especially relevant to the Georgetown community.
“The thing about Georgetown is that it isn’t a tech school. There is a reason people do science at a liberal arts college,” Axelrod said. “Especially being in D.C., there are so many unique opportunities that FISH fits really well with the Georgetown environment.”
So far, Parr and Axelrod said they were pleased with the turnout at FISH’s two recent events — a live viewing of the TEDMED conference and a lecture by medical researcher John Kheir.
“[TEDMED] invites the most forward-looking people in medicine and public health,” Axelrod said. “Kheir was invited because he is developing technology for the intravenous administration of oxygen, which will hopefully be a lifesaving technology.”
Parr hopes FISH will sponsor more events and speakers in the fall and specifically said she hopes to bring the director of the National Institutes of Health to campus as well as gain recognition from the Student Activities Commission.
“The ultimate goal is to foster a community and make science more visible on campus. Hopefully next semester we’ll get our SAC approval, and continue to bring speakers and make this a vehicle for science dialogue,” Parr said.
FISH board member Alex Kyrillos (COL ’15) said that scientists need to consider other disciplines in order to be successful with their work.
“I think it is really impractical to approach science issues in exclusion as these issues always interact with other factors, including economics, culture and politics,” Kyrillos said. “I decided to join FISH in order to get a better understanding of the wide variety of career options that focus on this interdisciplinary aspect of science.”
The club currently has a seven-member board and 60 people on its mailing list.
“We separate ourselves into boxes here — by major [and] extracurricular,” board member Ali Carter (COL ’15) said. “Often science kids are seen as science kids, and humanities people are seen as humanities people. This group is really trying to blend the two by showing how many different ways science comes up in everyday life and how it really applies to everything.”

The Smithsonian Institution will be forced to drastically reorganize its staff and resources when automatic budget cuts go into effect May 1.
The Smithsonian, the world’s largest museum system, is currently facing a $41 million reduction, or 5 percent, of its $996 million budget. The sequestration spending cuts aim to save the federal government a total of $85 billion.
Rather than cutting entire exhibits or museums, the Smithsonian plans to distribute the cuts across many levels of the institution.
“We are absorbing that cut mostly through deferred maintenance, hire freezing, reduced travel, reduced contracts — administrative things,” Smithsonian Chief Spokesperson Linda St. Thomas said.
St. Thomas added that although the majority of the public would be unaware of most cuts, some of the cutbacks would be immediately apparent to museum-goers.
To cut costs, the Smithsonian will reduce its security force, possibly leaving some exhibitions without supervision. As a result, the museums may have to limit the number of galleries open each day.
“We may have to close some exhibits within art museums, and that will depend on our security for that day,” St. Thomas said.
St. Thomas added, however, that all museums would remain open.
“You might find a closed exhibition within a museum, but you will never find a closed museum,” St. Thomas said.
According to a recent Huffington Post story, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution Wayne Clough said that the institution is also cutting some of its educational outreach programs, including the production of digital lesson plans used by 80,000 schools.
Nevertheless, St. Thomas said that the impact on museum visitors would be minimal.
“Saying, ‘Reducing the number of free exhibits’ sounds like we are permanently closing exhibits, and it makes a distinction between free and other [types] … everything is free here,” St. Thomas said. “Only a few exhibitions here and there will be temporarily closed. … We are trying to do the best we can to minimize the impact on the public and visitors.”
Despite St. Thomas’ assurances that the museums would be minimally impacted, some students expressed concern.
Christy Slobogin (COL ’16) pointed to art history classes that rely on Smithsonian exhibits to enrich the course.
“For our art history classes, the most fulfilling part of the class is being able to actually go to the exhibits and experience the art,” Slobogin said. “If there are exhibits that we need to go to, that are closed, that obviously poses an issue. … It’s completely different in real life versus on a computer screen … where you can’t even fully comprehend the detail.”

Right to Life increased its presence this week with a series of events to celebrate life and bring awareness to the various threats it faces in the 21st century.
Life Week began with a display of 3,300 flags on Copley Lawn Monday to display the number of abortions that take place in the United States every day.
Right to Life has expanded its campaign from previous years to include programming on the death penalty.
“This is a more comprehensive Life Week than past Life Weeks,” Right to Life Vice President Evelyn Flashner (COL’15) said. “We’ve done Flag Day for many years, but this year we really are trying to do the week bigger.”
The group screened the film “Dead Man Walking” as part their discussion of the death penalty Wednesday.
“We try to be all-encompassing, so [Wednesday] we [focused] on death penalty,” Right to Life Development Chair Kelly Thomas (SFS ’15) said. “Our big thing is that we are consistently pro-life: we are anti-euthanasia, anti-death penalty. ‘Womb to tomb,’ as we call it.”
However, abortion prevention remains at the core of Right to Life’s mission. On Tuesday night, Right to Life brought four prominent panelists to discuss the legal, ethical, and medical dimensions of abortion.
Marguerite Duane, an associate professor in the Department of Family Medicine, discussed her decision as a physician to refuse to prescribe patients contraceptives or assist them with abortions.
“It’s not only a conscience thing but a health thing,” Duane said. “If you look at the harms of contraception, unfortunately the pill is promoted as the panacea for all women’s health problems — what’s frequently ignored is that the World Health Organization categorizes birth control as a group one carcinogen, which is the same category as tobacco.”
Duane said her pro-life views stem from religion.
“If you read the Bible, if you look in Genesis, the very first words God ever said to man in Genesis 1:27 were, ‘Be fertile and multiply,’” Duane said. “To destroy that gift is to say to God, ‘What You gave us is not important.’”
Georgette Forney, who spoke on the same panel as Duane, is the founder of the Silent No More campaign, through which women who have had abortions can share their experiences.
“When I was 16 years old, I had an abortion,” Forney said. “That’s not something I’m proud of to share. For 19 years, I worked really hard to make it OK, and no one knew how much pain I was in, until the day that I came face to face with the fact that I didn’t just have an abortion — I aborted a child.”
Right to Life maintains its presence on campus throughout the year, tabling in Red Square twice each week. In January, the group brought students to the annual Right to Life March on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade and attended the Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life, the largest student run pro-life conference in the nation.
H*yas for Choice, which held Choice Week in March, recognized the importance discourse between the two groups.
“In an institution like Georgetown, we should encourage all sides to express their views,” H*yas for Choice President Laura Narefsky (COL ’14) said.
However, Nerafsky said that the prominent flag display on Copley Lawn and the signs that read, “Women Do Regret Abortion,” did not promote open conversation.
“My main concern is the demonstration on Copley Lawn, instead of engaging the issue in a positive way, … some of the signs and flags have the effect of traumatizing women who have had to deal with these experiences in their lives,” Narefsky said.

Through a program called Jesuit Commons: Higher Education at the Margins, Georgetown faculty and staff are teaching online courses to refugees in Africa and the Middle East.
Founded in fall 2010 as a pilot program by a collaboration of Jesuit universities and organizations such as the Jesuit Refugee Service, Jesuit Commons uses distance-education tools to connect faculty members from U.S. Jesuit universities with refugees in United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees camps.
While Georgetown was part of the founding team and contributes teaching staff to the program, the university further increased its involvement by donating Kindles, which allow books and assignments to be downloaded for future use without a constant internet connection.
Jesuit Commons currently works with four UNHCR camps in Kenya, Malawi, Jordan and Syria, although the Syrian site is no longer operational due to warfare. Approximately 160 faculty members from 36 U.S. universities and 363 students are participating.
Jesuit Commons is seeking additional funding in order to increase its staff, infrastructure and technology, as well as to add seven new sites in Afghanistan, Chad and the Thai-Burmese border.
Georgetown faculty members have been primarily involved with the camp in Kakuma, Kenya, which is composed largely of Somalis fleeing a prolonged drought.
In June 2012, several Georgetown faculty members, including Vice President for Mission and MinistryFr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., and representatives from the College Dean’s office toured the camp and met the students.
Jesuit Commons Academic Coordinator Neil Sparnon stressed that public perceptions of refugee camps are often inaccurate.
“When most people think of refugees, they think of people setting up a short-term camp,” Sparnonsaid. “The data that we have is the average stay in a refugee camp is 18 years.”
In response to this long-term nature, Jesuit Commons offers refugees three-year, 45-credit liberal arts diplomas, accredited by Regis University in Denver.
Georgetown Associate Vice President for Compliance and Ethics James Ward, who teaches an online Jesuit Commons class in interpersonal communications, emphasized the refugees’ eagerness to learn.
“They are hungry for education and thirsty for knowledge and contact with people in the United States and elsewhere,” Ward said. “They want education even if they can’t get a job like a Georgetown student might be able. They have hope and they can use their education to become leaders in the refugee camps.”
Sparnon added that the program’s value exceeds the information taught in the classroom.
“We expect our students to use their learning in their environment,” Sparnon said. “It’s not just about employment — it’s about enriching their lives. We hope for these people to use their skills wherever they are.”
Campus Ministry Interreligious Coordinator Lisa Pannucci, who has taught an online Jesuit Commons class on world religions, said that the project embodies Jesuit values.
“The idea [that] we only engage our Georgetown bubble is no longer the norm,” Pannucci said. “We are trying to expand not only our perspectives but also the perspectives of the students we work for.”

After spending the summer as a journalist in Iraq, Christian Chung (SFS ’15) looked to his experience to found the U.S.-Middle East Youth Network, an international group that joins students in both regions to debate and discuss foreign policy.
“I … had the opportunity to really engage with college students focusing on many of the same issues and academic areas and interests as me,” Chung, now president of the network, said. “There was no real opportunity to broadcast their thoughts and policy proposals or to really be involved in the public discourse on critical policy issues.”
The network, which Chung officially founded in late February, encourages lively debate on foreign policy and socioeconomic issues.
“The core of our mission is really to provide a forum that gives young people in the U.S. and Middle East a platform to come up with and advocate for policy ideas, but from the youth perspective,” Chung said.
Chung began to develop the network in December, and the leadership team is now composed of 15 Georgetown students. The administrative center of the group is located at Georgetown, while the network itself currently includes 45 students in the Middle East, specifically at the University of Kurdistan-Hawler and the American University of Iraq-Sulaimani.
Already, the network has founded the Middle East Youth Policy Forum, which sponsors a speaker series and an interactive blog.
“Being able to engage with students on these topics [through the speakers] brought to light the fundamentally different perspectives of students in Iraq or Egypt,” Chung said.
According to Chung, the organization ultimately hopes to start an annual youth policy conference, inviting students from D.C. and the Middle East to participate in expert panels and present on policy ideas.
Members said that the network offers students the opportunity to engage and interact with students outside of the U.S.
“I was immediately interested and drawn by the network’s focus on connection between students in the U.S. and the Middle East,” leadership board member Max Harris (COL ’15) said. “This is a unique initiative with a lot of potential.”
External Relations Head Will Simons (COL ’16) agreed.
“The network seeks to allow interested students to share their research and opinions with students from the region who have direct, firsthand experience of policy implications,” Simons said.
Hawdang Kamal, a student at the American University of Iraq Sulaimania, agreed that the network provides an opportunity to connect American and Iraqi students.
“The network gives us a great chance to re-build the ties between the East and West. The gap that history has made between the two does not work anymore,” Kamal wrote in an email. “We believe that we are all living in a circle and we cannot leave it, for we are bounded by each other. … This kind of network is the best effort [that] has ever made to make the circle enhanced by giving everyone the same chance to go across.”
