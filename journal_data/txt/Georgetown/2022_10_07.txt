A Georgetown University professor co-wrote a book on the different types of leaders who take over religious terrorist groups and how these groups sustain themselves during transitions of power. 
Elizabeth Grimm, a director of teaching in Georgetown’s Center for Security Studies (CSS) and an undergraduate associate teaching professor in the Walsh School of Foreign Service, wrote “Terror in Transition: Leadership and Succession in Terrorist Organizations” alongside American University associate professor Tricia Bacon. In the book, which was published Sept. 13, Grimm and Bacon examine 33 terrorist groups including Sunni extremist group al-Qaeda in Iraq and the white nationalist Ku Klux Klan to analyze how terrorist groups manage and adapt to major shifts in leadership. 
Grimm said she and Bacon chose to research and write about leaders of religious terrorist groups because of the fundamental role they play in influencing their followers.
“They often are imbued with a divine legitimacy in the eyes of their followers,” Grimm wrote to The Hoya. “Terrorist leaders are not just leaders of their organizations, but are perceived by the followers as religious or spiritual leaders as well.”
Grimm and Bacon identify five different types of leaders — caretakers, signalers, fixers, visionaries and figureheads — who differ in the degree to which they change their group’s ideology or operating tactics. For example, caretakers make relatively minor changes to either, while fixers conduct drastic overhauls of both.
The book explains that counterterrorism practitioners and other national security experts need to target terrorist groups from the top down in order to dismantle the whole organization, according to Grimm. 
“Founders play a critical role in establishing the how (tactics/resource mobilization) and the why (the framing) of terrorist organizations, which set a baseline from which successors execute either incremental or discontinuous change,” Grimm wrote.
At a book talk hosted by the Center for Security Studies on Sept. 27, the authors presented to students about their work.
Gabrielle Ellicott (SFS ’25), who took “International Relations” with Grimm in Spring 2022 and attended the talk, said Grimm and Bacon’s book is groundbreaking in its approach.
“Being able to sit down and hear from Dr. Grimm and Dr. Bacon regarding their newest released book was fascinating to say the least,” Ellicott wrote to The Hoya. “They truly are the first in their field to write such an expansive and analytical work on terrorist leadership both past and present.”
When Grimm and Bacon began their research in 2018, they knew they wanted to examine leadership in terrorist groups. As they dug deeper, the direction of the book changed, Grimm said. 
“Our initial interest was to examine terrorist leadership in between the large studies of effects of decapitation and singular profiles of individual leaders,” Grimm wrote to The Hoya. “It then expanded when we began to observe the critical role that terrorist founders play in their organizations, but that this role had not been significantly explored.” 
Grimm’s book fills a gap in the scholarship on terrorist organizations, given the current lack of research that compares the types of leaders across groups, according to a review written by Brian Phillips in Small Wars Journal.
“Most studies of leadership decapitation have either been case studies of single groups, or quantitative global studies of hundreds of groups,” Phillips wrote in the review. “More generally, the terrorism literature has insufficiently analyzed individual leaders of militant organizations — in spite of their obvious importance, and regardless of whether they were killed. To address these issues, Terror in Transition makes a highly valuable contribution to the study of leadership of terrorist organizations.”
Grimm and Bacon’s work is transforming the knowledge educators and students have about the nature of leadership within terrorist organizations, according to Ellicott.
“I had no idea what an impact the founders of these terrorists organizations would have on their ultimate actions and timelines,” Ellicott wrote. “I’m so grateful to learn from Dr. Grimm and Dr. Bacon and cannot wait to see where their research takes them next. ”

The former ambassador to Ukraine spoke to the Georgetown community about her memoir, diversity in the U.S. State Department and what a career in foreign policy looks like.
Marie Yovanovitch, who served as ambassador to Ukraine from 2016 to 2019, reflected on her memoir “Lessons from the Edge,” at the Oct. 5 webinar hosted by the Georgetown Institute for the Study of Diplomacy. The memoir details Yovanovitch’s experience testifying before Congress during the first impeachment of former president Donald Trump after he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate then-presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s involvement with Ukraine energy company Burisma.   
Following her testimony, Trump recalled Yovanovitch from her post in May 2019. Prior to her recall, Yovanovitch told three House committees that Trump had pressured the State Department to remove her from her role at the embassy.
Despite Trump’s accusations of disloyalty, Yovanovitch has won numerous awards for her contributions to U.S. foreign service — she earned the Senior Foreign Service Performance Award eight times, the state department’s Superior Honor Award nine times, the Presidential Distinguished Service Award twice, the Secretary’s Diplomacy for Freedom Award, the PEN/Benenson Courage Award in 2020 and the Trainor Award for Excellence in the Conduct of Diplomacy from Georgetown’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy in 2020.
Yovanovitch said her interest in international affairs stemmed from hearing stories about her parents’ upbringing in the Soviet Union during World War II.
“My parents had always said we were fortunate to grow up in the United States, given the freedoms that this democracy provided us,” Yovanovitch said at the event. “They knew what it was like to not live in freedom, and so they said we needed to give back. And so a career in foreign service and diplomacy, national security was a way of giving back, while also doing what I was most passionate about, what I was most interested in.”
In 1993, Yovanovitch served as a junior foreign service officer in Moscow during a clash between Russian President Boris Yelstin and the Russian Parliament over Yelstin’s attempt to dissolve the legislative body, an action that extended beyond his constitutional limits.
Being in a constantly evolving political environment in Moscow shaped her love for foreign service, Yovanovitch said.  
“I would lie in bed before the alarm clock went off, I would think, ‘I wonder what’s going to happen today.’ I knew it was not going to be the day that I had imagined and planned for the day before, and while that may be somebody’s nightmare out there, but for me, it was just important and exciting,” Yovanovitch said. “That’s what I would say to people considering careers in the foreign service or national security, that you can make a difference from the very beginning.”
Yovanovitch also served as the deputy director of the Russia Desk in the U.S. Department of State from 1998-2000 and spoke about her struggles with sexism as a negotiator.
“In many places around the world, including, frankly, in the United States, there is discrimination still, not just against women, but against all sorts of minorities,” Yovanovitch said. “It’s difficult to deal with, particularly in a foreign environment, because in a foreign environment, you can’t say, ‘Hey, Mr. President, that’s an inappropriate comment. Don’t touch me like that.’ You can’t do that.”
Despite doubting her competency, officials still had to recognize the authority afforded to her by her position as a representative of the U.S., according to Yovanovitch.
“At the end of the day, whether you are an American woman or minority in the United States, whoever you are, if you are overseas and representing the United States, most countries are going to deal with you because you are a conduit to the United States and you speak for the United States,” Yovanovitch said. “Because overseas, we’re not just individuals, we are representing the flag and the people.”
In her three-year tenure as ambassador to Ukraine, Yovanovitch focused on addressing issues of corruption, instability and poverty in former Soviet states. 
Yovanovitch said the war in Ukraine is an issue that is close to her heart.
“I was in Ukraine about three weeks ago for a conference that was very short, somewhat sweet, also somewhat sorrowful,” Yovanovitch said. “But what impressed me is perhaps not something new to your audience, which is the continued courage of the Ukrainian people, the commitment to the cause and their confidence that they were going to win.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions pose an urgent threat not only to Ukraine but to democracy as a whole, according to Yovanovitch.
“Our prosperity would be at risk, our security would certainly be at risk and even liberty around the world would be at risk because he would be going in there and trying to undermine it at every turn, as he has tried to do in the United States itself,” Yovanovitch said. “So for me, this is the test of our times. I’ve never seen a challenge like this in my career or in my life. And I think we really need to step up.”

Georgetown University School of Medicine students led a training for congressional staffers on Capitol Hill about the signs of opioid overdoses and ways to safely intervene through the Hoya Drug Overdose Prevention & Education (DOPE) Project.
The training for congressional staffers took place Sept. 28 and was led by members of the Hoya DOPE team in conjunction with the Bipartisan Addiction and Mental Health Task Force, represented by U.S. Representatives David Trone (D-Md), Annie Kuster (D-NH) and Paul Tonko (D-NY), as well as National Drug Control Policy Director Rahul Gupta. Leaders of the training instructed participants on how to recognize the signs of opioid overdoses and how to intervene with lifesaving overdose antidote naloxone.
The students that comprise the Hoya DOPE team engage in training various groups on lifesaving treatments for reversing opioid overdoses. 93,000 people died from opioid overdoses in 2020, setting a new record high, according to a 2022 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report. This year, the CDC has already recorded over 100,000 opioid related deaths. 
In addition to the training given to congressional staffers, DOPE educates future physicians on how to best treat opioid use disorders and to improve patient care in the District, according to Kira Chandran (MED ’23), a member of DOPE. 
“We believe that community access to naloxone and overdose education are important parts of reducing opioid-related morbidity and mortality in DC,” Chandran wrote to The Hoya. “There are many people who have put a lot of work into reducing opioid-related deaths in DC, and we hope that our small contribution helps make DC a healthier community.”
As they enter clinical rotations during their medical school training, Chandran said members of DOPE have personally witnessed the impact of opioid overdoses on D.C. residents.
“In addition to our experiences in the hospital and outpatient clinics, we were first responders to an opioid overdose last year on a side-walk in Ward 5 of DC,” Chandran wrote. “We had naloxone with us and we were able to reverse the overdose before EMTs arrived on the scene.” 
DOPE was able to respond to the emergency because they are trained to recognize signs of overdose and because they carry naloxone on them, Chandran said. 
Regina LaBelle, director of the Addiction and Public Policy Initiative at the O’Neill Institute, a research institute within the Georgetown University Law Center (GULC) focusing on national and global health law, said distributing and raising awareness for opioid treatment is particularly essential in the District. 
“Given the high rate of overdose deaths in DC, it’s important that we all do our part to address this important issue,” LaBelle wrote to The Hoya. “The mission of our initiative is to advance evidence based policies to reduce overdose deaths and improve outcomes for people with substance use disorder.”
The opioid epidemic in D.C. has worsened in recent years, especially because of increased feelings of alienation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Lawrence Gostin, faculty director of the O’Neill Institute.
“The O’Neill Institute believes that opioid and other drug dependencies are among the most urgent public health crises facing America. The suffering, loss, and death has only escalated during the COVID pandemic, when so many people felt alone and isolated,” Gostin wrote to The Hoya. “And yet this is largely a preventable problem.”
Gostin said despite an increase in overdose related deaths, it is possible to avoid opioid overdoses with the right health policy measures.
“We can dramatically reduce opioid use and overdose with evidence-based solutions,” Gostin wrote. “It is our job as a Georgetown University institute to use our skills in law, policy, and research to make a difference in the lives of so many American families.”
As part of its mission to address the District’s opioid crisis, the O’Neill Institute is advocating for legislative change that supports the direct efforts of organizations like Hoya DOPE, according to LaBelle. 
“We’ve worked to encourage law enforcement in DC to carry naloxone; drafted model legislation which is currently before the DC City Council that will make certain that the proceeds of litigation brought against the opioid industry is used appropriately and expands access to evidence based policies; and removing legal and regulatory barriers that stand in the way of getting care to people in need,” LaBelle wrote. 
The new legislation responds to the District’s past misspending of federal funds for naloxone distribution and harm reduction services. According to a 2018 Washington Post investigation, D.C.’s initiative provided naloxone kits at rates three to four times lower than peer cities with similar opioid problems.
As a part of the D.C. community, Georgetown holds an obligation to support the District in fighting the opioid crisis, Gostin said.
“The key points are that opioid use and overdose is among the most pressing health issues in America, but that there are clear policy steps we can take to save lives and reduce suffering among individuals, families, and communities,” Gostin wrote.

Georgetown University students hosted a fundraiser to support immigrants in need of legal representation, raising over $1000 for the cause.
At the Oct. 3 event entitled “Iced Drinks Against ICE,” students from the Vietnamese Student Association (VSA), Hoyas for Immigrant Rights (HFIR) and Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán (MEChA), a student organization whose mission is to empower Mexican Americans through advocacy, sold iced beverages for $5 each, doubling their goal of $500 within the first few hours of the event. 
Proceeds from the event went to Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), an organization that provides legal representation to thousands of immigrants from nearly two dozen countries. 
Mikhail Floresca (NHS ’24), co-president of HFIR, said immigration law and misconduct from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Agency is a personal issue for many Georgetown students. 
“Displaced communities hit close to home for many people who identify as first-gen or immigrants here at Georgetown,” Floresca wrote to The Hoya. “With the mistreatment at the border and the recent bussing of migrants from Texas and Arizona to D.C., the narrative of migrant hot potato continues –– the government keeps passing us around like cargo, moving us back and forth without thoughts of our feelings and plights.” 
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a government agency tasked with securing the U.S. border and enforcing immigration law. According to Human Rights Watch, over 160 reports of misconduct were filed against ICE from 2016 to 2021, including assault, sexual abuse and discrimination. In addition, ICE frequently conducts raids on workplaces and residential areas, often arriving unannounced and separating families in the process.
Funds raised at the event went to ImmDef because of its work in uplifting migrants and providing them with essential research, said Tahis Meza (COL ’24), co-president of MEChA. 
“For our club, being inherently political, it was important to agree to work with organizations that further our political agenda aiding the Latine community and ultimately empowering and liberating the oppressed,” Meza wrote to The Hoya.
Annually, ImmDef helps more than 1,500 children defend themselves before judges and navigate the U.S. court system, something they would otherwise have had to do on their own. Currently, around 4,000 people are held in detention at the southern border in California every day, according to Freedom for Immigrants, a non-profit whose mission is to abolish immigration detention. Many have reported abuse in the detention centers, including medical neglect, limited food availability and inhumane solitary confinement.
Meza said Georgetown students should be aware of the injustice within the immigration system.
“I think the overall immigration system is deeply flawed in creating a cycle of migrants forced to come to the U.S. as a result of the conditions of their home state, only to be immediately illegalized upon arrival,” Meza wrote to The Hoya. “Students, being future leaders, ought to be conscious of the structural issues present in our government, present in our systems and present in the foundations of this country.”
VSA community outreach chair Angela Nguyen (COL ’24), who came up with the idea to host a fundraiser for immigrant rights, said VSA wanted to create a truly multicultural event that engaged multiple student organizations in a common goal.
“We had 3 organizations collaborating: one cultural org, one cultural-political org and one activist org, and we all came together because we all believe in something, and we made it work,” Nguyen said in an interview with The Hoya. “I feel like lots of times students feel like they have to do everything on their own, but that’s not the case. There is a whole community out there ready to support.”
Floresca said he hopes the event will inspire students to take further action toward immigration justice. 
“Far too often are people taking a bystander’s view of the issue,” Floresca wrote. “When families and livelihoods are on the line, HFIR firmly believes that people should come to learn more about the issue at hand. Going beyond recognizing to understanding is a huge step toward finding and addressing these injustices.”
