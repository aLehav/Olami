In response to the recent dialogue sparked by the naming of Mulledy Hall, University President John J. DeGioia has charged a working group of faculty, students and alumni to discuss the memorialization of the history of Jesuit slaveholding at Georgetown.
The Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation announced that it will seek to address the history and ongoing ramifications of slaveholding by Jesuits at Georgetown during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. This is the first working group on slavery charged by the president of a Jesuit university in the United States.
The announced retention of Mulledy Hall’s name reignited discussion of the history of slavery at Georgetown earlier this academic year. The hall, which comprises the Former Jesuit Residence alongside Ryan Hall, was named after former University President Fr. Thomas F. Mulledy, S.J., who authorized the sale of 272 slaves owned by the Society of Jesus in Maryland to two plantations in Louisiana after he completed his term as president in 1838, ensuring their continued enslavement.
In a university-wide email sent last Thursday, DeGioia identified the primary objective of the working group as providing recommendations on how the university should reconcile with the historical connection between Georgetown and slavery.
“I have asked this working group to provide advice and recommendations to me on how best to acknowledge and recognize Georgetown’s historical relationship with the institution of slavery, examine and interpret the history of certain sites on our campus, to include Mulledy Hall, and convene events and opportunities for dialogue,” DeGioia wrote.
DeGioia selected history professor Rev. David Collins, S.J., to serve as chair of the working group, as well as 13 other members representing different facets of the university community, including English professor Carolyn Forché, Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny and student Matthew Quallen (SFS ’16), a columnist for The Hoya who has previously written on the history of slaveholding at the university.
After the addition of a member from the Black House, which has yet to select a representative to the committee, the membership size will increase to 15.
In his position, Collins will lead the committee in not only evaluating a potential change to the name of Mulledy Hall, but also in consolidating resources regarding the history of slavery at Georgetown.
“It’s more than about the name of a building,” Collins said. “It’s about bringing into consciousness and expanding our concrete knowledge of what happened, what the implications and significance are for that and how it should be part of our self-understanding as not just any university, but as Georgetown University.”
At the group’s first private meeting on Thursday, Collins distributed a reading list of books and online materials, which included a selection from Professor Emeritus Robert Emmett Curran’s “The Bicentennial History of Georgetown University.”
Collins also said that the committee considered similar initiatives in other universities with histories involving slavery, such as Brown University, the University of Virginia and the College of William and Mary.
In 2003, Brown University President Ruth Simmons charged a steering committee to address the historic relationship between the university and slavery, particularly the Brown family’s involvement in the slave trade.
However, Collins said that the working group will specifically focus on slavery in the context of Georgetown’s history.
“[Brown] is a kind of a gold standard for how it might be done,” Collins said. “Our situation is different. Our history is different. There is no absolute boilerplate.”
After developing a comprehensive understanding of the university’s slaveholding history, Collins said that the group will shift its focus to the current implications of slavery on the university community and society as a whole.
“The question [is] not just ‘Well then, how do we airbrush somebody out of a photograph that did something deplorable?’ but ‘How do we look at a blindness that had a vicious dimension to it in the early 19th century, and use that as a moral example to find the blindness and the viciousness in ourselves?’” Collins said.
Although the group has not made specific plans yet, Collins referred to artistic projects and events such as public forums as ways to increase the community’s awareness of the issue.
Office of the President Chief of Staff Joe Ferrara said that DeGioia acknowledged the difficulty of the committee’s work.
“Talking about slavery in our country is not always pleasant. It’s a painful memory,” Ferrara said. “[DeGioia] really thanked the group and said, ‘This is not always easy work.’”
Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., a member of the working group, said that the committee will work to engage the entire community through its work.
“It’s not that this group is a closed group that’s having this conversation on campus. It’s actually in dialogue with so many other actors on campus: student groups, residential life, student affairs, our academic departments. All of these will be in dialogue,” Carnes said. “We are going to learn a lot from what others bring to us throughout the year.”
Associate professor of history Marcia Chatelain, another member of the committee, agreed that the group will help the community understand more about Georgetown’s history.
“I hope I can bring my experiences in helping communities have difficult dialogues with openness and respect. Also, as a historian, I’m always happy to see any process that allows people to learn more about institutions they hold near and dear,” Chatelain wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Connor Maytnier (COL ’17), a resident assistant at the FJR and one of three students on the committee, said that he looks forward to including the voices of the wider community in the group’s discussions.
“While there will always be the 14 of us working diligently as a group to continue researching, interpreting and discussing, it is important that we engage the greater university community, both past and present, throughout this process as best we can,” Maytnier wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Christopher Wadibia (COL ’16), who has served as a student delegate to the FJR planning committee and was selected for the committee, said that he hopes the group will reflect the values of the community.
“I would like to see the working group come to a conclusion honestly representative of the will of Georgetown’s heterogeneous yet singular community,” Wadibia wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Through the working group, Collins said that he hopes to start a meaningful dialogue on campus reflecting on the university’s history.
“President DeGioia could have administratively changed the name [of Mulledy Hall] just overnight,” Collins said. “But this is the virtue of being at a university and taking that aspect of our identity very seriously. We’re not going to do it overnight. There are ways that that could be easier, but the lesson would be lost.”

Anglican priest Naim Ateek and Mandela Institute for Palestinian Prisoners co-founder Jonathan Kuttab discussed several issues faced by the Christian minority in Israel and Palestine in a panel discussion in Copley Formal Lounge on Friday.
The event, which was titled “Christians in the Holy Land,” was organized by the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. Around 10 attendees joined Ateek and Kuttab in the discussion.
Ateek, who is a native of Palestine and a former canon of St. George’s Cathedral in Jerusalem, is the co-founder of the Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center, an organization dedicated to overcoming denominational barriers to peace in Israel and Palestine.
Kuttab, who serves on the board of SELTC, is a practicing lawyer in Washington, D.C. and Israel, where he specializes in human rights violations and social justice in Palestine.
According to Ateek, he founded SELTC with the intention of joining Muslims and Christians together through dialogue.
“SELTC took on itself that responsibility of trying to really bring the Muslims and the Christians together,” Ateek said. “This interfaith ministry is trying to bring down any prejudices between our communities, yet there is still so much more to be done.”
As the discussion progressed, Ateek highlighted the achievements of Palestinian Christians in establishing interfaith networks and community-building institutions. He also discussed particular instances in which the Christian minority continues to be victims of racism and violence.
“[The Christian community] has a number of organizations — not only schools, but clinics, hospitals, guest houses — and we make sure there is no discrimination on any basis, including religion,” Ateek said. “Yet Israel is an apartheid state — a racist state — and racism is spiraling. Many of the outside settlers coming into Palestine are burning churches, and there is no action on the part of Israel.”
Over the course of the discussion, audience member Kathy Aquilina, the program director of local nonprofit Initiatives of Change, commented on Ateek’s views of Zionist settlers in Palestine and the violence they influence.
“One of the scourges against Palestinians are some Americans who have become stridently religious settlers who exhibit violence and racism against them,” Aquilina said. “[Palestinians] feel that the United States has continually disappointed them by not standing up for justice in the area.”
Ateek recalled his own experience with early Zionist settlers during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The conflict broke out as a result of tension between Zionists and Arabs as a result of the negative feedback to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, which displaced more than 700,000 native Palestinians.
“Israel has never treated Christians in any special way,” Ateek said. “I recall that I was a boy in 1948 when the Zionists came and occupied our town. There were Christians and Muslims living in it, and the Zionists drove us out and we had nothing. To them we were just Palestinians, and they wanted to occupy the land and everything we owned was confiscated. The discrimination going on today has continued and is against Christians and Muslims.”
Kuttab then turned the conversation toward questions on the implementation and practice of international law and human rights as a way to protect the Christian minority.
“The battle for human rights, for international law, for equality before the law, is no longer theoretical and theological and academic,” Kuttab said. “It becomes an issue of practical, daily survival. The reality is that there are laws on the book that lead necessarily to discrimination, to racism, to denial of rights. This is where we must concentrate our efforts.”
Kuttab then mentioned that while there are laws in Israel that protect individuals from racism and discrimination, these laws only apply to Israeli citizens and do not extend to non-Jewish individuals living in the Palestinian territories.
“If a system of law and a legal system grant rights to one particular portion of the population and denies it to a portion of the population on the basis of religion or race or creed, then it has a name. It is called apartheid, and it is evil and improper and worthy of a fight against it,” Kuttab said.
Afterward, the panel opened up the discussion to the audience. Fr. Drew Christiansen, S.J., the co-director of the Program on the Church and the World in the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, asked both panelists to go into further detail on the space nonviolence plays in pushing for equality and justice among Palestinians.
“I really wanted to know what space there was for nonviolence,” Christiansen said. “The Israelis don’t allow nonviolent demonstrations to occur, so the military action and police action that occur, depending on what side of the green line you’re on, most often prevent there from being any nonviolent resistance. And without that kind of space, you are going to have clashing.”
Kuttab responded to Christiansen’s question by discussing the role nonviolence should play in the activism for justice and equality, while linking the theme of this activism to faith and Christian dogma.
“I think nonviolence is the only effective method and Palestinians have practiced it intermittently with varying results,” Kuttab said. “Nonviolence has to be the only way because violence only breeds more violence. We must find a better way than to out-violence the other side. Nonviolence is the way to go.”

With the 2016 general presidential election over a year away, student groups in support of candidates from both major parties are beginning to gain momentum on campus.
So far, several groups have created Facebook pages and held interest meetings to support their preferred candidates.
The group supporting Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a candidate in the Democrat primaries, stands out as the most vocally supported by Hoyas on social media. More than 350 people follow the “Georgetown for Bernie 2016” Facebook page. Caleb Weaver (SFS ’16), Irene Koo (COL ’16) and Erin Leonard (SFS ’16) run the Sanders group and regularly contribute to its page, promoting its events. (full disclosure: Koo is a community member of The Hoya’s editorial board).
Weaver said the group does not yet have a definite strategy.
“It’s a very organic kind of process,” Weaver said. “There’s not a lot of strategy to it. We try to keep it relevant to current events. … As we’ve started a little bit of activity on campus, we’ve used it to promote our events and meetings.”
Weaver added that members of “Georgetown for Bernie 2016” hope to increase their popularity on campus in the coming semester, and has already hosted several general interest meetings and a “Bernie Birthday Bash” fundraiser to celebrate the senator’s birthday earlier this month.
Weaver highlighted these gatherings as a way to both build awareness and identify students with expertise who can contribute to the group.
“Those events really helped us find people at Georgetown who are excited about Bernie and who have skills … in anything campaign-related that we could potentially use,” Weaver said.
Also on the Democratic side, “Hoyas for Hillary,” which supports former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is also active on campus and social media. It boasts more than 100 Facebook followers, the second-highest following among active Georgetown groups.
Amanda Shepherd (SFS ’18) founded the group this semester after interning in Clinton’s national headquarters in Brooklyn over the summer. She said the group aims to have an impact beyond campus as well.
“Because we are officially affiliated with the campaign, we can actually go out in the D.C. or the [D.C., Maryland, Virginia] area and do things like clip-boarding events and canvassing days that can really connect us to the larger voting base,” Shepherd said.
No other groups in support of other Democratic candidates have been formed at this time.
On the Republican side, no sizable Georgetown student groups have yet formed in support of anyone in the crowded primary field of over 15 candidates.
The most prominent so far, “Georgetown Students for Carly,” supporting former Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina, has 43 likes on its Facebook page.
Alexander Bobroske (SFS ’17), also a columnist for The Hoya, started the group as a subset of the national grassroots organization Carly for America. Bobroske said he has been interested Fiorina and her campaign since last year.
“We already have a core team of past and current [College Republican] board members on our core Georgetown team, but also a lot of College Republicans now view her in their top one or two candidates,” Bobroske said.
Bobroske added that  “Georgetown Students for Carly” has also helped similar groups across the country gain momentum.
“A big thing we’re focusing on now is we’re all tapping into our personal networks from internships and from different places across the country to start recruiting chairs in to other states,” Bobroske said.“Just the other day I was setting up a team in North Dakota.”
Other Republican candidates that have organized support on campus include “Georgetown Students for Rand” supporting Rand Paul (R-Ky.) with 19 Facebook likes, and “Georgetown Students for Rubio” supporting Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), which currently runs a closed Facebook group for its eight members.
Georgetown University College Republicans Chair Amber Athey (COL ’16) said she believes pro-Republican groups will emerge stronger as the primary elections continue.
“I think you’ll see the groups grow in size as well as number once the number of candidates decreases,” Athey said. “I think when the candidate pool gets below 10, that’s when we’ll see a group for every remaining candidate.”
Bobroske said leaders of different campaign groups have also discussed organizing a presidential candidates exposition or debate among student campaigners.
“Students could come to one location and talk to our teams … so they can compare candidates and have someone tangibly there,” Bobroske said. “I think that’s something really good that all the campaigns seem excited about.”
Although several members of both Georgetown University College Democrats and College Republicans are involved in these groups, the organizations as a whole are not permitted to endorse specific candidates.
However, the university’s strict campus campaigning regulations could halt the growth of these organizations. As a tax-exempt organization, the university cannot use its resources to support any particular candidate. According to the restrictions, campaign groups may not use official student email addresses to send anything campaign-related, print any campaign-related material with university-owned printers or officially reserve space in a campus facility.
Weaver said he believes that these limitations could potentially hinder political participation on campus.
“The practical effect of those rules are really chilling for the ability to participate in politics on this campus,” Weaver said.
Despite these restrictions, Shepherd was still optimistic about balanced political engagement on campus.
“In general I think that this is a really interesting campus for political work,” Shepherd said. “There are a lot of campuses across the country that are sort of very right or very left and we aren’t. I think we really do have a big representation of all points of view.”

Amid increasing concerns and complaints from the community regarding the SafeRides program, the Georgetown University Police Department updated its LiveSafe app over the summer and changed its policies for the program to mandate drivers to accept all requests made by students and faculty.
To improve user experience, GUPD further integrated SafeRides and LiveSafe, which was created in September 2014 as a digital platform for GUPD to respond to campus safety concerns. With the new update, users can message GUPD while they are waiting for a SafeRide and check the location of their SafeRide vehicle.
GUPD Chief Jay Gruber worked with SafeRides staff in the past few months to ensure that the revamp occurred as smoothly as possible.
According to Gruber, this added functionality has made the app much more user-friendly.
“We’re getting an increasing number of people using the LiveSafe app. It’s very accurate, and I think that students are more comfortable texting back and forth,” Gruber said. “I look at all of the conversations between the end user and my dispatcher and really, they’re very cordial conversations.”
Gruber also said that the new policy of accepting all riders ensures that the SafeRide program is completely inclusive, though there has not been an increase in the number of riders.
“Anybody who calls will get a ride,” Gruber said.
Students have reacted positively to these changes to the program.
Since SafeRides was created 15 years ago, it has faced difficulties with poor response times.
Tatiana Shashou (MSB ’17) recalled an experience from her first year on campus, in which she found SafeRides to be inefficient. According to Shashou, each time she called SafeRides, the GUPD dispatcher either told her to take a bus or sent a driver who never showed up.
“I was out with my friends and it was dark and we didn’t want to walk home, Shashou said. “We called SafeRides and said that we were scared and asked if they could come get us, and they said ‘Oh no, here’s a bus you can take instead. … Though, I’ve heard that they’ve really upped their game.”’”
While accessibility issues have abated, SafeRides drivers, some of whom participate through the Georgetown University Student Association, have expressed discontent at some of the program’s practices.
Caroline James (COL ’16), a student driver for SafeRides, said that that the working conditions are poor and disorganized for drivers.
“They should know where the van is, full of gas, with a working radio. I don’t think that’s too much to ask,” James said. “The students have been working so hard to keep the SafeRides program going that they have been volunteering to drive. If students are going to volunteer to drive, then GUPD needs to do their part and have the vans ready to go on those nights.”
However, Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) said that all of his experiences with driving for SafeRides have been positive.
“I’ve driven it three times, and each of the times it’s been an awesome experience. I sign up with a friend and we show up and are guided through the process with GUPD. They show you how to get the radio and where to get the car and everything,” Goldstein said.
Goldstein also said that the program is an effective way to help members of the community feel safer.
“I’m really appreciative to Chief Gruber and everyone that makes this possible because when it’s dark and cold, a long walk can actually be dangerous,” Goldstein said. “SafeRides provides a real service to the Georgetown community and I’m glad that I can play a small [part] in that.”

The Institute of Politics and Public Service hosted Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and IPPS Fellow Luis Fortuño (R-Puerto Rico) for a dialogue on the political implications of Pope Francis’ Congressional address to a crowd of around 60 people in McCarthy Hall on Friday.
Promoted as a conversation between both Democrat and Republican Catholic politicians, the dialogue centered on Pope Francis’ theme of seeking bipartisan solutions to address ethical issues.
Director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life John Carr moderated the discussion. He began by recalling that when John F. Kennedy ran for president, he was criticized by other important politicians because he was Catholic and they worried he would be influenced by the pope.
“Now, it seems like the only thing the Democrats and Republicans agree on is they need advice from this pope,” Carr said.
When Carr asked the panelists what areas of the pope’s speech most resonated with them, both Kaine and Fortuño mentioned the pope’s affirmation of American service.
“It is important to look at what our personal responsibilities are, and I believe he admires that of our nation, but at the same time he feels that we have a social responsibility as well,” Fortuño said. “It’s a dual responsibility; it’s not only one or just the other — it’s both.”
Kaine agreed and highlighted the pope’s encouragement of both the public and Congress to accept greater social responsibility.
“[Members of Congress] contribute to a denigration of the entire enterprise [of politics] and a lowering of expectations,” Kaine said. “But his speech was to set high expectations, and not only for us, but through us to the American public.”
Carr continued by asking about the challenges Pope Francis posed to Washington politics and partisan divides. One issue Fortuño highlighted was the difficulties regarding immigration.
“The greatest challenge, and a challenge that he has thrown back at the European leaders as well, with the migrant crisis that is actually overcoming many cities in Europe, is that we also have a responsibility in our hemisphere with our own migration issues and how to deal with it,” Fortuño said.
Kaine pointed to how the vote to defund Planned Parenthood was timed for the papal visit, and how the pope’s words could influence future negotiations.
“The challenge is how to grapple with the church’s teachings about sexuality and reproductive rights and contraception and abortion,” Kaine said. “To what degree are those doctrines about our personal behavior and to what degree are those doctrines about what laws we should pass for people who are in different churches and have different traditions?”
Kaine also referenced the Catholic doctrine on the sanctity of life in terms of his role on the Armed Services Committee and the decision to sell weapons to Egypt.
“If they’re using them against political opponents,” Kaine said. “I mean, are we giving them arms for money that’s ‘drenched in the blood of the innocent?’”
Later in the discussion, Carr raised the question of how politics and morality are connected and what may possibly result from the pope’s call for cooperation .
Fortuño went on to discuss his belief that the pope’s visit played a pivotal role in Speaker of the House John Boehner’s decision to resign in October. Fortuño expressed hope that the resignation will improve political dialogue in Congress over the next few weeks, with the government shutdown approaching.
Kaine also addressed the sentiment that both parties were committing sins of omission when handling issues regarding migrants, particularly in the context of the Syrian refugee crisis. Kaine touched upon the debate over whether or not the U.S. should become further involved in the Syrian Civil War.
Richie Mullaney (COL ’18), a member of the Georgetown University College Republicans, attended and spoke about the importance of listening to the pope’s call for bipartisan collaboration.
“What I think is so important for conservatives to recognize is the universal theme of Pope Francis’ papacy,” Mullaney said. “That they’re not partisan goals that Pope Francis is advocating for, that they’re universal goals and that we shouldn’t be worried about whether to achieve his ends, but rather the means to achieve them. I think that once we recognize that Democrats and Republicans can agree on Pope Francis’ goals, then we can debate about how we get there.”
President of the Georgetown University College Democrats Matthew Gregory (SFS ’17) agreed and noted the unifying nature of the pope’s call to action.
“When you look at a visit of someone like the pope coming in and treating these as moral issues rather than political [ones],” Gregory said, “it really allows us to reevaluate some of the things that have brought us apart, both Democrats and Republicans and within the Democratic Party.”
IPPS Executive Director Mo Elleithee said the event was intended to look at the combination of varying faiths and political views, especially given the Jesuit values of the university.
“People practice their faith differently in their lives and public officials are no different,” Elleithee said. “To be able to put those pieces together, and I think Georgetown is uniquely positioned to be able to do that because faith is part of our DNA here at Georgetown, I think it does help give people a window into what makes the people that make the system work.”

The African American Studies Program and the Provost’s Committee on Diversity created a petition to establish an African American studies major last Wednesday, five years after the idea was first discussed.
The petition calls for an increased allocation of resources and faculty to the African American Studies Program. The program currently consists of a minor as well as elective courses.
Student organizers of the petition declined to comment on the number of signatures received to date. As of press time, the Facebook event page of the petition has received over 200 RSVPs.
Director of African American Studies Robert J. Patterson said that the program and students on the Committee on Diversity will use the petition to assess student, faculty and alumni support for the major before submitting a proposal to the college dean’s office.
“The petition helps us to project how the major, and minor for that matter, might expand. … They have played an important role in making the case for this major,” Patterson said. “Students demonstrate demand by taking courses, and have expressed in numerous settings … that this major is something that they desire.”
Daniel Zager (COL ’18), a member of the provost’s Committee on Diversity, said that the committee will continue to advocate for increased support for the major.
“Our role as students so far has mainly been to connect with other students, survey interest in the potential major and gain student support for this proposal,” Zager said.
The idea for the major program came as a result of recommendations from the Initiative on Diversity and Inclusiveness in 2010. The petition also comes after the Main Campus Executive Faculty voted in favor of adding a diversity requirement to the core curriculum in April 2015.
According to Patterson, the proposed major will address a series of topics that relate to African American history and culture.
“[It would include] issues of race and power, issues of epistemology and cultural production, the improvement of black life [and] how globalization has affected our study of race,” Patterson said.
Currently, a preliminary description for the major includes its requirement of the “Introduction to African American Studies” course. The major will also include a thesis-based capstone course that students would take their junior or senior year.
According to Patterson, the major will require a total of 10 courses, and will be divided into two concentrations, which have yet to be determined.
Patterson said that, although he hopes the major will be in effect by next fall, it would require a large amount of work for both himself and his team.
“Part of my responsibility is to oversee the curriculum, and so, in that capacity, I have been working with a group of faculty members for the past two years to do the necessary research, gather the necessary information to make sure that we have the resources, the demand and even the institutional support to move forward with creating the major,” Patterson said.
Patterson also said that submitting a proposal for the major will be an extensive process. For instance, students campaigned for nearly a year and a half before the justice and peace studies major was established.
“The next part of the process involves submitting the proposal that justifies the reasons for going from a minor to a major, the requirements of the major, the resources that we would need in terms of faculty and finances and other related issues,” Patterson said.
After the proposal is submitted to the College Dean’s Office, the Curriculum Committee of the College Executive Council will review the proposal and provide a report with feedback and suggestions before voting on the proposal.
If the Dean’s Office is in favor of the proposal, it will go to the university’s board of directors for a vote.
Many faculty members have expressed their support for the major, citing the importance of the African American Studies Program.
College Dean Chester Gillis said that the major would be a good addition to the school considering its increasing popularity.
“I think this will be a valuable addition provided that there is sufficient demand for it,” Gillis said. “I think African American studies is an important program. It represents an important community, an important literature and history and academic discipline.”
Marcia Chatelain, a professor of history who is also in the African American Studies Program and an associate professor in the Department of History, said that the addition of the major will put Georgetown on the same level as other elite universities who already have such programs.
“If Georgetown decides to create an African American studies major, we will join other elite universities and the finest Catholic universities in ensuring that students can focus their intellectual interests within a field that has produced some of the most important and relevant scholarship over the course of nearly 50 years,” Chatelain wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Zager agreed that the establishment of an African American studies major is overdue, when compared to peer institutions. For instance, Princeton University began offering an African American studies major this academic year.
“As for the major itself, it’s long overdue. Many of our peer institutions are already far ahead of us in instituting the major, and, simply put, only having a minor at Georgetown is not enough to study the topic in depth,” Zager said.

The BEACH, a summer installation of 650,000 translucent plastic balls at the National Building Museum in the District was moved to Dupont Underground for a second installation and art competition Sept. 7.
Designed by architecture collective Snarkitecture, the BEACH was open at the NBM July 4 to Sept. 7. The interactive collection was modeled to resemble a beach, with beach chairs lining the “shore” and mirrored walls creating a seemingly infinite mirage.
The NBM’s Vice President for Marketing and Communications Brett Rodgers said the installation was a massive success this summer.
While the previous summer’s exhibition, an 18-foot maze, drew 50,000 visitors between July and September, The BEACH attracted 180,000 beachgoers within the same timeframe.
“It exceeded our expectations by a lot,” Rodgers said. “People enjoyed it a lot of different ways for a long amount of time and seemed to really appreciate that. Not to mention that it’s completely unique, there’s just literally nowhere else you can have this experience.”
After the installation closed in September, 100 volunteers moved the installation to Dupont Underground, an art collective that is transforming an abandoned trolley station under Dupont Circle into a retail, exhibit and performance space. The move required 25 hours of work, aided by four donated trucks from Bookstore Movers.
Dupont Underground Managing Director Braulio Agnese said The BEACH reinstallation was a chance opportunity, after meeting with representatives from the NBM and spontaneously offering to craft the plastic balls a new home.
“It’s something of a rarity, I think, for something like this to be repurposed,” Agnese said. “We are trying to open a 14,000 square foot space. … Here’s a chance to fill it with something unique and different, a chance to showcase our mission, what we’re trying to bring to the city. … It’s ambitious but I think it has amazing potential.”
To repurpose The BEACH’s balls, Dupont Underground plans to host a design contest for the unveiling of the space that makes use of the balls in an innovative way that differs from the NBM’s original setup.
The collective aims to closely tie the competition to the opening of the new exhibit, which will take place late October or early November.
Representatives from the NBM, Dupont Underground and the D.C. art community will judge the contest.
Agnese emphasized the versatile nature of the reinstallation contest and the Dupont Underground project.
“We always hope to have something that will interest different types of people who like different types of cultural activity, whether it’s a public event — we’re developing a relationship with D.C. Public Library — or it’s a pop-up, drink thing, retail experience or experimental theatre,” Agnese said. “We think there’ll be something to attract a lot of different types of crowds. We have ideas, and we know what the solutions are.”
Sabrina Landegger (COL ’19) visited The BEACH installation over the summer and said she enjoyed the interactive nature of the art piece.
“It’s a really fun way to bond with friends, if you’re looking for something outside of the Georgetown bubble to do,” Landegger said. “People were really happy. … It’s just really enjoyable, super random. You’re not going to find [it] anywhere again.”

Washington, D.C. government officials are in the process of introducing new licensing regulations on personal trainers, which will require that personal trainers looking to break into the fitness industry either obtain a two-year degree or submit certification from a recognized fitness program.
The regulations are a result of last year’s Omnibus Health Regulation Amendment Act, which granted oversight of any possible regulations to the Board of Physical Therapy Licensing. This board will create draft regulations pending approval from other city government departments. Set to be released next month, any proposed regulations will also have to go through a public consultation process before they can be published as law and formally implemented.
The current proposal drafted by the Board would grandfather in those who have been personal trainers for more than two years, with new personal trainers feeling the most drastic effects of the new regulations.
This specific move, however, is being met with resistance by both gym owners and certain members of the D.C. City Council.
Graham King, founder and owner of local gym Urban Athletic Club, said details of the final regulations, such as new certification requirements for training activities as well as the possibility that the limitations may discourage newcomers to the industry.
“There’s so many different sorts of caveats,” King said. “[If there were regulations] maybe I wouldn’t have started the gym, gone into business. … These regulations [could] stop this 20-year-old, 22-year-old person from starting their dream.”
King added that he is worried about the possibility of the regulations spreading elsewhere in the country with D.C. as a precedent.
“D.C.’s a lot easier to try [to implement regulations], and once you have it done, you can take that and say, ‘Look it worked here, let’s go to every other state’,” King said.
King also expressed concern about the impact the regulations will have on his business and the rest of the local fitness industry.
“I’m going to get fewer people fit, or people are going to pay more money, so the customer pays more,” King said. “I can’t expand my business like I would, which means I’m not creating any jobs. So it’s hurting my own location; it’s hurting everyone else; it drives prices up, so people are paying more for training, [and] we can help fewer people.”
Additionally, King raised doubts about the proposal to give the responsibility of drafting new regulations to the Board of Physical Therapy Licensing, rather than to experts in the fitness industry.
“Physical therapy deals with injured people,” King said. “Personal trainers deal with well people.”
However, the Board of Physical Therapy Licensing is confident the regulations are necessary, and that they will have a positive impact on the industry.
“The Board of Physical Therapy remains firm in its belief that there should be regulatory oversight of the personal fitness profession and is aware of recently raised concerns over the drafting of regulations,” Director of Communications and Community Relations in the Department of Health Marcus Williams wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Board is working to achieve a balance that would address both public safety and protection as well as maintain an open and supportive approach to both the public demand for fitness services and the industry that responds to that demand.”
In response to the concerns of local gym owners, Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans introduced legislation this week to repeal the licensing requirements for personal trainers.
“The proposed regulation of personal fitness trainers is an overreach by the District that would significantly harm the well-being of our residents and the entrepreneurial climate of the District,” Evans said in a statement posted on his website.
Additionally, Mayor Muriel Bowser did not reappoint Senora Simpson, former Chair of the Board of Physical Therapy Licensing, who led the initial drafting process. Simpson has been replaced by Timothy Vidale, who proposed the current licensing requirements.

The Senior Class Committee hosted fewer activities for this year’s graduating class than previous years’ at its annual weeklong “Dis-Orientation” celebration, which took place last week.
While the general schedule of the week remained consistent with past years, the committee cancelled traditional events such as the bar crawl and Oktoberfest in an effort to focus their resources on improving the quality of events.
“I wanted to focus on making better events,” Senior Class Committee Events Chair Lauren Sinclair (COL ’16) said.
For a registration fee of $30, seniors participated in a variety of social activities, including two keg parties.
Other events, such as the fall career fair, were open for all seniors.
Sinclair said that her team worked carefully to develop the week’s programming.
“It’s hard to plan a week full of events,” Sinclair said. “You have to get creative with the type of events you have.”
The day after an opening ceremony in O’Donovan Hall on Sept. 18, seniors took to Multi-Sport Facility to cheer on the football team in its loss against Dartmouth College, which also included a giveaway.
Other planned activities included a beach volleyball tournament in the Southwest Quadrangle and a movie screening and barbecue on Copley Lawn.
However, the screening and barbecue were eventually cancelled because of the collapse of the projector screen and rainy weather.
Sinclair said that, while it was difficult to entice seniors to attend events, offering free food seemed to be a successful strategy.
“Motivating people to come out on busy weeknights has been one of the toughest obstacles that I’ve had this week,” Sinclair said. “But usually free food is always a good incentive to get people to come out.”
Seniors over 21 years old also partook in events that featured alcohol, such as Jammin’ Jerseys: Senior Night at The Tombs and a keg party in Leo’s and the toga partyclosing ceremony on Leavey Esplanade.
Seniors of legal drinking age said that they anticipated these events.
Channing Ruff (COL ’16) said he was disappointed that this year’s program was not any different than a regular weekend evening.
“The Tombs usually does have a lot of seniors in it anyways because of the age group, so Senior Night was very similar to a regular night out at The Tombs,” Ruff said.
Sinclair said that events that featured alcohol tended to be the most popular.
“I’ve noticed that it’s the events with alcohol that people usually stick around at the longest,” Sinclair said.
Seniors under 21 were not allowed to participate in Ri Ra Night, an event that raised donations for the Class of 2016 fund.
However, seniors who were not of legal drinking age were still allowed to take part in the keg parties at Leo’s and on Leavey Esplanade, although they were not allowed to drink.
According to Sinclair, the committee did not want to exclude any students who signed up for the activities.
“Eighteen-year-olds [could] go to those and [could] still enjoy the parties with seniors, whereas with the bars they wouldn’t necessarily be able to get in,” Sinclair said.
Lizzie Pinede (COL ’16), a 20-year-old senior, said that she wished there had been a less expensive alternative registration fee for students who were unable to drink.
“It would have been nice if there was a cheaper option, since I couldn’t drink and there were two 21-plus only events that I couldn’t attend,” Pinede said.
However, Matthew Fried (COL ’16) responded positively to the program this year.
“I loved getting together with my senior friends,” Fried said. “I’d say find a group of friends to commit to going to the events early and often, and it will end up being a lot of fun.”

While I am friends with some of the wonderful people involved in the planning DisO (and still think they are all amazing), DisO turned out to be pretty much be a $30 t-shirt. The leo’s opening party and the closing kegger were the only even possibly worthwhile events. And maybe scheduling the kegger when it wasn’t going to rain or having an indoor location would have been nice (togas are not warm fyi). 
Most of the other events were almost insultingly pitiful. A night where 21+ seniors can go to the Tombs? Like Every other night?! Or the Ri Ra event where you had to make another donation…and not for an open bar but for basically happy hour specials. How wonderful.

The Washington Metro Area Transportation Authority resumed full eight-car service this week in conclusion of a summerlong project that repaired 100 of its rail cars.
The renovated 4000-series rail cars, each of which includes eight cars, were removed from service for safety inspections, which involved fixing door operation issues to enhance customer safety after multiple reports of doors opening on moving cars. Although no doors failed the safety inspections, several door components did not meet minimal acceptable standards.
WMATA reduced the number of eight-car trains in service on Mondays and Fridays so that the cars could spend more time in the maintenance yards.
WMATA media spokesman Richard Jordan explained that maintenance was scheduled for the summer, since fewer commuters take the Metro during the warmer season. Mondays and Fridays are also typically the lightest ridership days of the week. Ridership is about 10 percent lower on those days, according to a WMATA press release.
“We thought it would be a good time to for us to address some of the maintenance issues that we could take care of,” Jordan said. “That’s why we took advantage of the summer and why we were down to six cars for some trains.”
According to National Parks Service spokesperson for the National Mall Matt Litterst, the summer Metro changes did not have a noticeable effect on tourism to the National Mall and nearby monuments.
“I know our visitation has been up this year,” Litterst said. “So anecdotally, no.”
The maintenance project also aimed to fix the aging status of WMATA’s fleet. In particular, the 4000-series  cars have been the most problematic, according to Jordan.
“The 4000s are ones that require the most maintenance for some reason,” Jordan said. “It is the least reliable.”
As a result, WMATA plans to replace the 4000-series and the 1000-series, which are approaching 40 years of service, with the newest being the 7000-series, in the coming months.
Samantha Menegas (COL ’19) used the Metro to commute to her internship over the summer and said she encountered problems due to a lack of available trains.
“I took it during rush hour from 9 to 5 and it was always insanely crowded,” Menegas said. “There was this one time … they offloaded the whole Metro onto the platform that already had people on it. I had to wait for three more Metros to go by before I could get on another one.”
Melissa Crawford (MSFS ’16) said she noticed that Metro service slowed in the summer. After using the blue-orange line last year, she switched to the green-yellow line for her summer commute and experienced frequent delays.
“Over the summer I lived on the green-yellow line and that was the one with a lot of problems,” Crawford said. “It takes forever to get places.”

In response to a recent uptick in email phishing attacks early this year, University Information Services has continued to deter hacking attempts and warn students and faculty against clicking on suspicious links through email messages.
A phishing attack occurs when a hacker emails a link to gain personal information from the recipient’s account. According to Interim Vice President for Information Services Judd Nicholson, several of these attacks have resulted in the loss of personal information, such as contact lists that are then used by hackers to send out further emails.
“There have been a handful that have been successful, but it’s usually varying degrees of success,” Nicholson said. “It usually depends on the information that they’re trying to gain from you.”
In the email sent to the university community last Tuesday, Nicholson said that UIS has been able to block 95 percent of phishing and spam before they are received.
However, Nicholson said that users need to exercise caution to prevent the remaining five percent of phishing emails from materializing into attacks.
“We need your help with the five percent that gets through,” Nicholson wrote. “Please exercise caution before clicking on links or downloading attachments, even from senders you know.”
According to Nicholson, phishing emails received by students and faculty at Georgetown often come from contacts one may be familiar with.
“Some of the e-mails that have been sent to our community look like they come from a legitimate source … but are not,” Nicholson said. “It is an attempt by someone to get account information from you.”
While Nicholson declined to provide specific details on how many phishing attacks had been launched against Georgetown accounts, he noted most universities often experience a greater amount of attacks during the beginning of the semester. He attributed the phenomenon to hackers who intentionally target student accounts during this time.
“I don’t know if I can quantify it,” Nicholson said. “But it’s important to know that attempts to compromise accounts occur almost continuously.”
Chief Information Security Officer Joseph Lee explained that if hackers gain access to one’s user identification and password, the whole network of their Georgetown accounts, which includes MyAccess and GOCard information, could be compromised.
“UIS has identified several compromised GU NetID accounts,” Lee wrote in an email to The Hoya. “If a GU account is hacked … the hacker may have access to the GU email and other GU systems.”
Nicholson explained that while students need to be careful when handling all emails, accounts are generally safe from spam, as UIS filters the vast majority of emails containing spam.
“Spam and phishing emails make up over half of the emails sent worldwide,” Nicholson said. “We basically filter through our systems 90 percent of those e-mails, so … we are filtering through quite a bit of that.”
Nicholson praised the efforts of different departments to prevent against phishing emails by taking extensive precautions. He explained that all e-mails sent to the community by his office can be validated by checking the website for the subject line.
“At Georgetown, we’ve tried to institute a process where our community can validate any emails sent,” Nicholson said. “Folks can go back and look to see if it is a legitimate email.”
Lee explained that the main way to prevent hackers from gaining information was to change one’s password at times allotted by UIS and to make it as complex as possible. In addition, Lee recommended that a Georgetown password should be different than other passwords adopted by the user.
“Ideally, the password used for your NetID should be different than passwords you may use for other online accounts,” Lee wrote. “Passwords should also be complex enough to prevent guessing or ‘cracking.’”
Ariana Sadoughi (SFS ’19), who works at the UIS desk at Lauinger Library, said that while she has not been approached by a victim of an attack yet, students unfamiliar with phishing attacks should use their instincts in determining whether an email is from a valid source.
“[Students] should be cautious when they open their e-mails,” Sadoughi said. “They should carefully look at who sent the e-mail. … If it looks suspicious, don’t open it.”
