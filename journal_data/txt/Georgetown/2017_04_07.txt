The Environmental Protection Agency is no longer serving its purpose and requires budget cuts, according to climate change contrarian Myron Ebell, who oversaw President Donald Trump’s EPA transition team Wednesday.
During the event hosted by the Lecture Fund with Jeremy Symons, associate vice president of Climate Political Affairs at advocacy group Environment Defense Fund, and Amy Harder, journalist of media group Axios, Ebell spoke out against the need to immediately address climate change and transparency in the EPA.
According to Ebell, who helped appoint senior staff and develop environmental policy as head of the transition team, the EPA has become oversized.
“The agency has largely accomplished its mission for clean air and clean water,” Ebell said. “This is an agency that has gotten fat and lazy, and that there is room to cut, particularly when you look at the freelancing that the agency has started to do beyond its statutory responsibilities. There is a lot of room to cut the budget.”
Trump appointed Ebell to head his EPA transition team last September. Ebell currently heads environmental and energy policy at Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank funded in part by the coal industry, according to The New York Times.
About 200 members of student advocacy group Students for Climate Security protested Ebell’s appointment by marching from Red Square to Ebell’s offices on L Street on Nov. 18.
Ebell said immediate action is not required to address climate change. According to Ebell, most polling that indicates Americans want action on climate change is misguided, as many supporters of policies targeting climate change do not consider the cost associated with such programs.
“The public does not agree with those proponents, those promoters of global warming alarmism, who say that we have to take immediate and very expensive action which will impoverish people for no benefit,” Ebell said.
According to Ebell, action to address climate change can often end up hurting those it is supposed to help.
“In Germany, which is far ahead of us in the global warming agenda, in terms of implementing its policies, electric rates are now three times higher than they are in the United States, and hundreds of thousands, and millions of people are suffering from energy poverty, having their lights cut off, having to choose between eating and heating in the winter, and this is a real issue,” Ebell said.
Energy in Germany costs on average 40 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with 12.5 cents per kilowatt hour in the United States, according to Forbes.
Symons said Trump’s March 28 executive order eliminating climate change policies established during former President Barack Obama’s administration, including the Clean Power Plan that would have closed hundreds of coal power plants, is detrimental to the EPA’s work.
“This is a demolition plan. They went right for the throat,” Symons said. “This administration has an agenda that’s extreme, that’s I think out of touch with the public.”
Ebell said he believes the EPA should publicize its findings in order to justify the emphasis on the EPA and its continued funding.
“We have to have real standards,” Ebell said. “Trust but verify: We don’t know if they’ve made up stuff because it’s secret. What if you’re wrong? We’ve wasted trillions of dollars to no impact. What do you think all of these trillions of dollars, the impoverishment of poor people in poor countries, has achieved?”
According to Symons, the EPA has historically been transparent about its data.
“Transparency in science is important. I think the EPA has a good track record with that,” Symons said. “There’s no evidence that the EPA has made up anything.”
Symons said the EPA is necessary to tackle climate change in the United States, as states are unable to address climate problems with their budgets.
“They don’t have the money; they don’t have the expertise,” Symons said. “It doesn’t serve anyone’s interests when the states are competing in a race to the bottom to attract businesses.”
Symons added that while the EPA has made progress toward cleaner air and water, the work toward a cleaner environment is not yet over.
“The air is cleaner; the water is cleaner. That is a legacy that I inherited from generations before me, that’s one I hope to pass on to you and your kids,” Symons said. “But it wouldn’t have happened without the Environmental Protection Agency fighting for the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act. It doesn’t happen by accident.”

The university plans to include the price of 24 loads of laundry in room and board charges for the 2017-18 school year to reduce the economic burden of laundry costs on students receiving financial aid.
The Office of Residential Living collaborated with the Georgetown University Student Association on the program, which will consider one load as both washing and drying. The program will allow students to do 1.5 loads of laundry per week on average without using additional GOCard funds. The laundry fee will not be included in the room rates for townhouses.
Students currently pay $1.75 for each separate load of washing and drying, following a fee increase from $1.50 in September 2016.
According to Speaker of the GUSA Senate Richie Mullaney (COL ’18), the inclusion of laundry costs will be offset by the elimination of other fees.
“They adjusted other costs to offset the new laundry cost in this trial run because the university is not looking to profit off of laundry,” Mullaney said about the university administration’s efforts.
The inclusion of laundry in room and board charges comes amid an average 2 to 3 percent increase in housing charges next year.
Charges for double rooms in residence halls will increase 2.8 percent, from $5,045 to $5,188, while charges for double rooms in apartments will increase by 2.7 percent from $5,440 to $5,592.
According to the Office of Residential Living, this increase is in line with the typical annual rate increase of 2 to 3 percent. On average, students can expect an approximately $300 increase in housing each year, according to Executive Director for Residential Living Patrick Killilee.
General increases in operational costs for the university, including staffing, utilities, maintenance and furniture, primarily drive the increase, according to GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Christopher Holshouser (MSB ’18).
The planned $6 million renovation to residential living complexes, including the complete renovation of 15 units in Alumni Square, are not contributing to the increase in charges. Residential construction projects, which include improvements to current buildings, are covered by university capital budgets for investments in master planning, according to Killilee.
According to Mullaney, the number of loads of laundry was decided upon in an effort to encourage students to do laundry regularly and to not overload the machines. The number is subject to change if students do not use the total amount of loads available or if the university notices a need to increase the number of loads.
Mullaney said minimizing the cost of the plan was essential.
“When I was in the Student Life Committee of the senate, we did a large poll of students to see how they felt about laundry in general at Georgetown,” Mullaney said. “One thing that we saw was that some students were particularly concerned with pricing and inequity as it relates to laundry prices.”
Concerns about the financial burden of laundry on low-income students began under the previous administration of former GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and former GUSA Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17), who led the initiative.
“Socio-economic inclusivity has been a clear priority for our administration, and this effort is but one of many things GUSA has done this year to tackle the issue,” Fisk said.
Currently, low-and middle-income students who receive financial aid are not able to apply it towards laundry. Under this program, laundry can be covered by financial aid.
Mullaney said the laundry system’s implementation next semester is a trial run, and GUSA plans to review it with the university next semester.
GUSA is also working with the administration to ensure that the cost of any unused loads of laundry can be returned to students as a refund, according to Mullaney.
“We’re still working out the kinks and still working with the administration to make sure that its equitable not just for some people, but for everyone,” Mullaney said.
Fisk said he believes this plan will have a significant impact on the whole Georgetown student body, but particularly on low-income students.
“This tangibly helps so many students here, especially those from low-income backgrounds,” Fisk said. “Small changes like this are concrete steps toward making Georgetown an easier, more accessible place to navigate.”

For Sexual Assault Awareness Month, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority police officers hosted outreach events at five Metrorail stations Tuesday to raise awareness about sexual harassment on the Metro.
In collaboration with Collective Action for Safe Spaces, which is a D.C.-based organization focused on ending public harassment and sexual assault in the area, and Stop Street Harassment, officers spoke to commuters at the Gallery Place, Shaw-Howard, L’Enfant Plaza, Rosslyn and Silver Spring train stations during evening rush hour to encourage riders to report incidents of sexual harassment.
Reports can be made via WMATA’s text message system, hotline number and web portal, as well as reporting directly to an employee or sending an email.
These efforts follow the launch of WMATA’s anti-sexual harassment public service campaign last fall, which encourages victims and witnesses to speak up. According to WMATA, this day of spreading awareness is part of a multi-level campaign that began in 2012 to combat sexual harassment on Metro services.
A January 2016 WMATA online survey reported that 21 percent of transit riders in the D.C. region have experienced sexual harassment on public transportation. Following those results, WMATA has worked to improve employee training and raise public awareness on the issue through anti-sexual harassment advertisements.
According to the survey, verbal harassment was the most common at 75 percent, with women nearly three times more likely to experience it than men. Twenty-six percent of responders said they had been touched in a sexual way and 2 percent had experienced sexual assault.
Metro Transit Police Chief Ron Pavlik said despite Metro reporting a 32 percent decline in reports of harassment last year, those experiencing harassment should be discouraged from reporting incidents to police.
“Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and have the right to travel without being harassed or intimidated,” Pavlik wrote in an April 4 press release. “We encourage anyone who feels they have been the victim of harassment to report it regardless of whether you believe it rises to the level of a crime.”
Rosslyn Metro employee T. Richardson said occurrences of sexual harassment have decreased dramatically, based on her experience.
“There are memos sent out by WMATA about having a safe work environment; that’s always reiterated from our officials to us. There’s nothing on those lines [sexual harassment] that I’m aware of that happens,” Richardson said.
CASS Executive Director Jessica Raven wrote in an April 4 press release that other organizations can learn from WMATA’s work with CASS and Stop Street Harassment to prevent sexual harassment.
“WMATA has been a leader in training staff and raising public awareness about sexual and gender-based harassment, and WMATA’s anti-harassment campaign, in partnership with CASS and Stop Street Harassment, is a model for others to replicate,” Raven wrote.
Tuesday’s outreach marked the first time WMATA collaborated with Stop Street Harassment as part of the organization’s International Anti-Street Harassment Week. Since 2012, CASS has collaborated with WMATA to create public awareness, collect data and train transit employees and police.
Organizations from 43 countries are honoring International Anti-Street Harassment Week this year, which seeks to draw awareness to and end gender-based street harassment.
Author and gender-based violence expert Holly Kearl established Anti-Street Harassment Week in 2012 after overwhelming support convinced her to extend the awareness from her original one-day campaign in 2011.
Kearl said her organization’s collaboration with WMATA stemmed from her desire to raise awareness and educate people on the options they have for reporting incidents of harassment. The outreach group stationed themselves at Metro elevators to hand out leaflets and wristbands to commuters.
“People were really supportive and appreciative, so that was a positive thing. And some of the people were like, ‘Oh I didn’t even know there was a campaign, I didn’t know I could report this, thank you for letting me know,’” Kearl said. “That’s what we’re trying to do — just let people know that there is a campaign against harassment on the metro, and there are several ways to report it.”
Kearl, who received a master’s degree from The George Washington University, said she was motivated by her own experiences of sexual harassment in the D.C. area to write her master’s thesis on the subject.
“I started Stop Street Harassment a year after I finished my thesis. There’s no funding; I just volunteer my time, as do other people who help me,” Kearl said. “So, it’s grass-roots and I use Twitter and email all the time to promote the week and connect with people.”
The organization has expanded organically, with Kearl reaching out and raising awareness with supporters through social media. Georgetown has collaborated with Kearl before to spread awareness about sexual assault. The university and Kearl hosted political analyst and feminist Zerlina Maxwell in 2015 to discuss rape culture and sexual harassment. Stop Street Harassment also tabled in Red Square last year.
Kearl stressed that support needs to be more accessible off campus.
“There are often not resources for sexual harassment,” Kearl said. “If sexual harassment happens on campus, students can report it and get help from administrators, but when it’s off campus, it’s not the same process. There is a lot more need for information on what to do.”
Kearl noted that there are five ways to report sexual harassment in and around public transportation, which include sending an email dedicated to the issue or speaking to a bus driver or station manager.
“A very preliminary thing that we are still working on is changing the cultural norms that having been going on for so long,” Kearl said. “We are just trying to educate people that this is a human rights violation, it’s a form of sexual violence and it’s not okay.”

Washington, D.C. school officials pushed back against a report published by the University of California Los Angeles Civil Rights Project claiming the city’s public and charter schools are among the most segregated in the country,
The Feb. 9 report said District public schools are characterized by both race and income. Its authors said 71 percent of black students attend “apartheid” public schools, those that have less than one percent white students.
The report also said the average black student attends a school where two-thirds of their classmates are in poverty.
According to the D.C. Public Schools website, for the 2015-16 school year, of the over 48,000 students who are enrolled, 64 percent are black, 18 percent are Hispanic and 13 percent are white. The website does not break down demographics by specific school.
While rates of segregation have decreased in the District since 1992, the report’s co-author Gary Orfield, co-director of the UCLA Civil Rights Project, criticized the pace of de-segregation in District schools.
Orfield said segregation limits how much students can achieve later in life.
“In 1957, Dr. Martin Luther King stood before the Washington Monument in his first national speech and called upon the country to implement the vision of equality in the Brown v. Board of Education, calling the ruling a ‘great beacon light of hope,’” Orfield wrote in a Feb. 9 press release. “Unfortunately, that vision remains unfulfilled. This report makes clear that substantial school desegregation was never achieved for black students.”
The report argues that District charter schools have the most extreme segregation in D.C, saying that at charter schools, 80 percent of students are black, compared to less than 5 percent of students who are Asian or Caucasian.
D.C. Public Charter School Board Executive Director Scott Pearson pushed back against charges of segregation in the District’s charter schools, saying that all families, regardless of race, are given opportunities to send their children to charter schools.
Pearson also praised the charter schools’ methods to become more diverse, such as providing free transportation from different parts of the city.
“Students from all racial, economic and geographic backgrounds are attending public charter schools throughout the city,” Pearson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We’re proud that our schools are becoming increasingly diverse.”
Orfield also criticized the District’s school voucher programs, saying they were ineffective in increasing diversity and often did not cover private schools’ tuition fees. D.C. is home to the nation’s first federally funded school voucher program.
The Scholarship for Opportunity and Results Act, provides vouchers to more than 1,100 low-income D.C., students to transfer from public schools to private schools. The program also provided federal funding to traditional public schools and public charter schools in the District.
“It’s clear that charters and vouchers have done little to reduce segregation in the D.C. schools,” Orfield wrote. “Given the proclamations of the Trump campaign and new Education Secretary Betsy Devos, a strong proponent of charter schools and vouchers, educators and policy leaders in the region may want to closely consider the effectiveness of those strategies.”
However, Orfield also noted that changing demographics in the city should reflect greater diversity in the school systems. He said that since 1980, the city has become diversified to the point where no ethnic group now has a majority, but the school system has lagged behind.
Orfield also noted “black flight” phenomena; black families moved in significant numbers from the city to the suburbs. From 1980 to 2010, the District’s black population fell 31 percent while the white population grew 35 percent, according to the report.
“As ‘black flight’ to the suburbs mushroomed, young, mostly white, professionals redeveloped and gentrified a growing list of neighborhoods, but these changes usually did not significantly diversify the schools,” Orfield wrote.
According to Orfield, the report’s methodology combines city census data on race with the racial composition of schools. However, opponents have argued that simply because there is greater diversity of people in the city does not mean that it translates into greater diversity in school-aged children.
DCPS Communications Specialist Janae Hinson said DCPS’s aim is to educate all students equally, regardless of the racial composition of schools.
Hinson said their commitment to quality education is the same for whoever they teach.
“D.C. Public Schools is proud to serve all students who walk through our doors, regardless of race, immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression,” Hinson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We work to make sure that all students have a great teacher at the front of the classroom and are getting the same level of joy and rigor in our classrooms no matter the school or neighborhood.”

Glamour Magazine recognized Sarah Clements (COL ’18) as one of 10 recipients of its annual College Women of the Year award yesterday.
This year marks the third year in four that a Georgetown student has won the College Women of the Year award. Last year, Daniela Fernandez (COL ’16) won for her ocean sustainability work. In 2014, Kendall Ciesemier (COL ’15) won the award because of her years of service working with those affected by AIDS in Africa.
The award, which is in its 60th year, honors young women across the country for their involvement in their campuses and communities.
This year’s recipients work in fields ranging from law to global development to filmmaking. Former recipients of the award include author and designer Martha Stewart, former Dallas Mayor Laura Miller (D-Texas) and best-selling author Curtis Sittenfeld.
Clements, whose mother survived the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, started the Jr. Newtown Action Alliance to advance gun reform legislation. Clements also connected with Ronnie Mosley, a Chicago resident who lost a friend to gun violence, to establish the #Fight4AFuture Network, an activist group focused on gun violence prevention and criminal justice reform.
Recipients will be honored at an awards ceremony in New York City on April 25.
What was your first reaction to receiving the award? 
I was definitely extremely humbled and honored when I heard that I received the award. I know a couple of people from Georgetown, actually this is the third year in a row that a Georgetown student has received this award in particular, and knowing who the past couple of winners were from Georgetown, I was just really humbled to be in their presence. I didn’t actually learn until today who the other winners this year were, and just reading about them all day today, I’m so excited to be in their presence.
What was the process like to be honored among all of these empowering young women? 
I was actually nominated by two people, and I went through a few interviews with Glamour, and sent them some information about the work that I’ve done. Glamour did an amazing job. They all have an issue area or something in particular in their lives that they’re deeply passionate about and speak out about it and continue to stand up and fight. Even though we do that in all different ways, whether it’s filmmaking or law or activism, I think that’s really cool to see.
How did you get into activism? What were your first forays into that world like?
All through high school, I was involved in the ally community through our Gay-Straight Alliance. That was my first step into being an activist. The reason I got involved in gun violence prevention was because in 2012 my mom survived the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and pretty immediately after that I began moving forward through activism. You see this in other instances in other communities that have experienced horrible tragedies and violence, that everybody sort of has their own way of moving forward, and mine just happened to be through political activism.
Can you explain why gun reform is such an important topic for you today? 
My community and my family have been personally impacted by the gun violence in our country. Just statistically, the amount of guns that we have out in circulation in the United States, as well as the amount of people who are killed every year by civilian gun violence, as well as police-perpetrated gun violence, is astronomically higher than any other country in the world. The fact that thousands of people are killed by guns every year in our communities is something that should terrify and enrage everybody. The rest of the world sees the gun violence that happens in our country, sees the numbers, sees the mass shootings and pities us for not being able to make the change.
What advice would you give to those who are just getting into activism and activist causes?
Regardless of what issue are you want to work in, right now is very obviously an intense and important time to get involved. If you weren’t ignited by this election or by what’s going on in Washington, D.C., there’s so many organizations and causes that need your help in your communities. Right now is also an overwhelming time to get involved. Pace yourself, and be patient.
Who would you say is your biggest inspiration and why? 
I definitely have a ton of people I could list for my biggest inspiration, but I would say my mom because she also is deeply, deeply involved in political activism work at this point.
She survived the shooting, and literally the next week picked herself back up as soon as the new building opened, went back into the classroom and was there for her students. She didn’t miss a single day of work teaching her students for the rest of that school year and for the entire next school year. Since then, she is still teaching in the classroom and at the same time has become a huge community organizer and leader in the gun violence prevention space. Her resilience and drive inspires me every single day.

The Georgetown University Student Association senate unanimously approved a bill Sunday expressing concerns about new policies requiring student and administrative groups to pay for security at certain events.
GUSA Senator Hunter Estes (SFS ’19), who introduced the bill, said the Georgetown University Police Department decides if an event requires security and how many officers the event sponsors must hire.
According to Estes, GUPD requires officers for events expected to exceed 200 attendees, or any other event it deems to require extra security. Student groups sponsoring events are expected to pay for the GUPD security detail out of club funds.
GUPD charges these groups $50 per hour per officer, according to Estes, and groups must hire at least two officers for a minimum of two hours. These costs, Estes said, can be limiting to many student groups.
“This is obviously a huge burden on student groups,” Estes said. “I’ve heard from [Student Activities Commission] that the very minimum being two officers for two hours, $400, that’s a third of the average budget for SAC’s groups.”
GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said the department has increased security as a response to concerns relating to current events.
“Over the past year GUPD has re-engineered the way we examine security threats for campus events. This is based on world, regional and local events,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have instituted many more bag checks, no-backpack events and increased security at our larger venues, including Gaston Hall.”
According to Gruber, because GUPD is not paid by the university to provide security at individual groups’ events, the groups must pay for security themselves.
SAC Chair Ricardo Mondolfi (SFS ’19) said he is concerned GUPD’s new event security policy is a back channel for the university to get money back from the Student Activities Fee.
“I am concerned that the university is sort of chipping away at student activities money, which is put in directly by students and is only going to student activities,” Mondolfi said. “So the whole loop is basically how your money, which you pay in your tuition bill, loops back around to your clubs, so in the end it should go back to students. I’m concerned that GUPD is making the money go back to the administration, which is not supposed to happen.”
According to Estes, it is not only student groups that are affected by this new policy. University administrative groups that put on events for students must also adhere to this policy.
“The Catholic Social Thought Initiative obviously doesn’t have a huge range of funds, especially since they’re newer, but they have the same thing. They don’t have any control over what GUPD sends,” Estes said. “That really hurts them because they have to leave this bubble of funding with no clue as to what they’re actually going to be charged.”
According to Estes, GUSA senators have formed a task force in conjunction with club representatives and advisory boards to open communications with GUPD.
Estes said the resolution aims to open communication with GUPD to potentially lower the cost to student groups required to hire GUPD for events. Estes said if student groups are going to be required to pay for security, they should have some say in how much security they require.
“The bill basically thanks GUPD for their service and thanks them for their willingness to provide security for us, but calls that we actually start having a discussion with the student body and the student representatives as to how we can change the policy,” Estes said. “Hopefully so that students can actually be included in the deliberative process as to how much security is actually needed. Because they’re the ones that actually understand what their event is going to be like.”

Researchers at the Georgetown University Medical Center’s Center for Child and Human Development presented the preliminary results of a study to assess the impact and effectiveness of a Sesame Workshop initiative for children with autism Tuesday.
The initiative Sesame Street and Autism: See Amazing in All Children tells the story of Julia, a Muppet with Autism Spectrum Disorder, and includes online videos, mobile apps, storybooks and daily routine cards that concern her experiences with ASD.
The online program seeks to build greater understanding of ASD to reduce stigma and encourage acceptance in local communities.
Led by Bruno Anthony, deputy director of the Center for Child and Human Development, and Hillary Robertson, a research associate, the study recruited over 1,000 volunteers of families with ASD and non-ASD children to test See Amazing’s effectiveness in increasing knowledge of and reducing negative biases towards ASD. The survey asked families to use various activities on the website and then complete surveys on their experience.
Anthony reported approximately 50 percent of children without autism showed an improvement in their knowledge and acceptance of autism after using See Amazing’s online resources, and 90 percent of volunteers enjoyed using the website.
He also noted parents of ASD children felt greater familiarity with and competence in managing the condition after using the program.
“We were pleased to see that the parents of ASD children showed significant reductions in ratings of caregiver strain and significant increases in feelings of competence from pre-viewing to follow-up,” Anthony wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The study found that See Amazing was successful across the board for parents of ASD children, as the researchers hypothesized, even improving parents’ comfort and willingness to have their children engage in their communities.
“We were most surprised by the large effects of the materials on feelings of community engagement by parents of ASD children, meaning parents’ comfort with engaging with their child in community activities,” Anthony wrote.
Parents of ASD children who felt the highest level of strain became the most likely to engage their children in community activities after using See Amazing materials, according to the report.
The study found that daily routine cards, a feature on the website designed to help children learn social and community skills, were helpful for both ASD and non-ASD families.
Anthony said he was surprised to see that the routine cards were highly rated among non-ASD families, as they are mainly intended for those affected by ASD.
Anthony and Robertson said that to continue their work in inclusivity for children with ASD, Sesame Workshop should consider developing in-person programs.
Anthony praised the organization for bringing Julia onto “Sesame Street” on April 10 in the episode Meet Julia.
The researchers also hope to continue studying the effectiveness of online autism training programs, moving their focus from assessing explicit biases to implicit biases, namely implicit attitude and stereotypes.
Robertson, who coordinated the study, said it was conducted with tight time constraints. According to Robertson, in addition to planning the study, the team also had to get it approved by an institutional review board and carry out the research within a year.
“The biggest challenge in planning and executing this study was time. We had a year to complete the project, which is not a lot of time in the research world,” Robertson wrote in an email.
Olivia Hamrah (MED ’17), a medical student planning to pursue Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, said she believes See Amazing is an effective and important tool in promoting awareness and tolerance of autism.
“I think it is a wonderful resource to expose the public to ASD in a positive light, and help parents explain autism to their children in a fun and effective way that models tolerance and inclusion,” Hamrah said.
She added that she was surprised to see substantial increases in understanding and acceptance in families with ASD children. She believes this adds to the efficacy of the See Amazing initiative, as it builds tolerance in external communities as well as within families.
“I would expect parents of non-ASD children to show a significant increase in these two outcomes after exposure to the See Amazing resource, but what I found surprising was that a similar increase was also seen in the parents of ASD children,” Hamrah said. “Not only are these resources effective in encouraging empathy and inclusion for children with autism among the general public, but also for promoting these attitudes within families of ASD children.”

A reporter’s Hispanic heritage is not at odds with objective coverage of President Donald Trump, said Mexican journalist Enrique Acevedo in an event in the Healey Family Student Center on Monday.
Acevedo said the perception of a journalist’s Hispanic background creating a reporting bias is unfair.
“We were criticized during the campaign for not following the traditional principles of journalism, and what that meant was we were being very critical,” Acevedo said. “These policies are not in the best interest of our audience, of the Hispanic community in this country, again not only in terms of immigration but in terms of job creation, in terms of access to healthcare, in terms of protecting the environment.”
Acevedo is the news anchor of Spanish newscast Noticiero Univision — which last year won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Newscast or News Magazine in Spanish — and a frequent contributor to NPR’s Here and Now. The event was co-hosted by the Georgetown University Graduate Association of Mexican Students and The Hoya.
Early in the campaign, Univision was denied press credentials to cover many of Trump’s events.
At the event, Acevedo said although the White House has cooperated with Univision and other hispanic outlets, higher administration officials remain mostly inaccessible.
“You think that after everything that’s happened, that there’s not a professional relationship with the administration, but there is: they have someone who speaks Spanish who can go on air and provide a response to our audience in Spanish,” Acevedo said. “What we don’t have are senior voices from the administration, including, of course, the president.”
There are 56.6 million Hispanics living in the country as of 2015, according to the United States Census Bureau. In an exclusive interview with The Hoya, Acevedo said journalists must be careful not to misrepresent the views of the Hispanic community for political reasons.
“Many Hispanics are socially conservative — not only the older generations but also the younger generations — so I feel that their views are not represented accurately, because some of the conservative leaders in Congress, in society, are reticent in speaking to outlets like Univision and others,” Acevedo said.
According to Acevedo, every Republican presidential candidate since Bob Dole, who ran for executive office in 1976, has given interviews to Hispanic media.
Acevedo said Hispanic reporters benefit from a close relationship with their own community, which gives them an added dimension of context in their coverage of politics and national issues.
“Most of us are immigrants and we are in constant communication with our audience; we know these communities, we have lived in these communities, we understand their concerns in a way that is much more personal,” Acevedo said. “In that sense, when we interview the president or we interview a senator we bring that context and that unique perspective with us.”
Acevedo cautioned against thinking about Hispanics and their interests as singular.
“It’s a sophisticated audience — much more than you’d think. Foreign affairs are constantly at the top of the concerns,” Acevedo said. “Terrorism, national security issues, are major issues for Hispanics. There’s an appetite to understand what’s going on.”
The solution to this disparity between perception and reality, Acevedo argued, is to step away from the D.C. echo chamber.
“This is probably the most important conversation we need to have right now: How do we solve our political divide?” Acevedo said. “Ironically, it’s about having more person-to-person conversation and less of this virtual experience where everything has to fit in 140 characters and it seems very artificial.”
One of the ways to achieve that human contact, Acevedo said, is to emphasize in-person reporting over commentary, which might seem distant.
“Some very accomplished journalists have been reduced to the role of moderators,” Acevedo sa id. “We need more people knocking on doors, asking questions, going through documents than people just moderating a discussion for an hour.”
Acevedo remains hopeful in the journalistic mission of highlighting the stories of communities that might be singled out or disproportionately affected.
“This is why we became journalists, because our work is very consequential, especially to the lives of our audience at Univision,” Acevedo said. “It seems like the stakes are higher than ever right now.”

Representing a $600 million increase in city spending from the previous fiscal year, Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) 2018 budget proposes a greater allocation of funds to affordable housing, public education and infrastructure repairs.
Presenting the budget to the D.C. Council on Tuesday, Bowser said the $13.8 billion plan, titled D.C. Values in Action, will improve programs to increase standards of living in all eight wards of the District.
“This budget fulfills our commitment to promote and defend D.C. Values and to aim for inclusive prosperity,” Bowser wrote in a press release Tuesday. “From historic investments in public education, to investments in job training, second chances for returning citizens, and ensuring our families have a safe, affordable place to call home, this budget prioritizes D.C. residents by standing steadfast to our D.C. values.”
D.C. Council will now review the proposal before voting on it.
However, councilmembers from Wards 7 and 8 criticized Bowser’s proposed $13.8 billion plan for not addressing health care and public safety.
“After reading most of this budget, I can’t reconcile the title with the actions proposed,” Councilmember Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7) said Thursday at a council budget hearing. “This should be a policy document reflecting what the residents want.”
Washington finished the 2017 fiscal year with a $128 million surplus and more than $1 billion reserved for a rainy-day fund, but Councilmember Trayon White (D-Ward 8) criticized the proposal for leaving the city’s poorest residents out.
“The poor are getting poorer, but there are cranes in the sky, and we are growing by leaps and bounds,” White said at the Thursday hearing.
The budget proposes a $105 million increase in funding for D.C. Public Schools and public charter schools to address the needs of the growing student population within the District and to provide more resources for charter schools.
About $2.3 million will be allocated to the creation of an office to help residents who recently left jail or prison, and $100 million are dedicated to producing and maintaining affordable housing, including funds to expand the New Communities Initiative, a program designed to restore dilapidated subsidized housing in the District.
Additionally, the budget proposes a series of programs under the umbrella program Pathways to the Middle Class. Bowser said the program is inspired by her belief that the city can and must uplift all of the members of the community in order to ensure the highest standard of living possible.
“Maintaining a strong, diverse, and resilient city requires that every resident has a fair shot, and a pathway to the middle class,” Bowser wrote. “This is accomplished by supporting our most vulnerable families and residents; providing job training that leads to real employment opportunities; and by nurturing our small businesses to ensure their growth and success.”
Funding for the Pathways to the Middle Class program includes more than $20 million for youth summer programs, full funding for the District’s share of the Washington Metro Area Transit Association’s budget and nearly $1 million for the Department of Small and Local Business Development’s Certified Business Enterprise, which helps area local businesses obtain government contracts.
Additionally, the budget allocates $16.8 million towards the D.C. Infrastructure Academy at Saint Elizabeth East, the site of a formerly self-contained mental health community in Anacostia. The facility is designed to focus on occupational skills training and work-based learning initiatives related to the infrastructure industry, including utility, energy efficiency, transportation and logistics sectors.
Bowser’s office said it plans for this program to offer various skills training, allowing residents the tools to begin and sustain careers in the infrastructure industry.
The D.C. Council will review the proposal and hold hearings during the coming months to receive testimony from area agencies, advisory neighborhood commissions, the advocacy community, other organizations and private citizens. Committees from these groups identify additional needs as well as report on how the budget may impact them.
After all committees mark up their reports, the Council’s Office of the Budget Director will prepare a draft report incorporating recommendations.
According to Bowser’s press release, the budget proposal was born out of direct input from District residents, as well as input from local organizations and committees. For the third consecutive year, Bowser hosted a series of budget engagement forums to hear from residents about their ideas and concerns about items including education, public safety, affordable housing, jobs, economic development, health and human services.
“The Budget Engagement Forums allow me to hear directly from residents about their values and priorities,” Bowser wrote in a February 22 press release. “The values and priorities of Washingtonians, are the values and priorities of our government — we want the budget to reflect this.”

The future of Zionism should be focused on the self-determination of Jews and Palestinians in the Middle East, according to panelists at the event “Unpacking Zionism” co-sponsored by pro-Israel group J Street Georgetown and the Georgetown Israel Alliance on Wednesday night in the Intercultural Center.
The event sought to offer several Jewish perspectives on Zionism, an ideology that advocates for the existence of a Jewish nation.
The panel, moderated by J Street Georgetown Co-chair Julia Friedmann (SFS ’19), included reflections on Zionism from GIA Cultural Chair Aviv Lis (COL ’19), Former GIA Vice President Jonathan Muhlrad (COL ’17), former GIA President Madeline Cunnings (COL ’18) and J Street Georgetown Co-chair Abigail Ulman (SFS ’19).
Lis said the roots of the modern political ideology of Zionism began in the early history of Judaism.
“Zionism is the national liberation movement of the Jewish people, through which we realize we are not only a people, but a nation that has a homeland,” Lis said. “We’re reminded of Zionism every year during Passover when we sing ‘L’shana haba’ah b’yerushalayim,’ or ‘Next year in Jerusalem’ — that is not a new thing that started in 1948.”
For Muhlrad, Zionism has deep personal meaning.
“I think about Zionism, I think about my grandparents — three of who were technically stateless persons after the Holocaust,” Muhlrad said. “Zionism is liberation from a history of oppression.”
Lis said Judaism and Zionism are not synonymous, but for many Jews they are closely interconnected.
“Zionism has a very important part in the collective Jewish play,” Lis said. “A lot of Holocaust survivors found their home in Israel after the war ended, some believing in God and some not. It’s a part of our Jewish history.”
Cunnings said her Israel-born mother raised her to see Zionism as a fact of life for Jews.
“There are non-Jewish Zionists and non-Zionist Jews,” Cunnings said. “Obviously, yes, they’re separate for some people. For me, I can’t fathom Judaism without Israel and Zionism.”
Ulman, though Jewish and self-avowedly pro-Israel, said she lacks a personal and spiritual connection to Zionism.
“I believe in the right of Israel to exist, and for Jews to have the right to live there, but I think Zionism has turned into something very spiritual and personal for a lot of people, and because I don’t have that connection, it wouldn’t be right for me to call myself a Zionist,” Ulman said.
Ulman also noted some people use the Zionist label to commit hateful acts. Nevertheless, Ulman said Zionism is not inherently racist, xenophobic or hateful.
“We need to recognize Zionism has been used for these destructive acts,” Ulman said. “In many cases, Zionism has not been this blanket good resembling Judaism. But define your own Zionism, [recognize] this happened and [create] a new vision of Zionism that is inclusive and equal.”
Muhlrad said Zionism is not defined by the actions of some of its followers.
“Just because there are some militant communists, that doesn’t then condemn all Communism or whatever that might be,” Muhlrad said. “What I would say to all people who do terrible things in the name of Zionism is that they need to become better Zionists. It doesn’t nullify Zionism.”
Lis said it is not racist for Jews to support a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. However, he noted the importance of compassion and understanding the historical ties between Jews in the 20th century and Palestinians today.
“My grandpa, living in war-ravaged Poland, yearning to live in the land of his people, is no different from a Palestinian farmer yearning to return to the olive grove his grandfather planted in Jaffa. It’s the same homeland, and we need to figure out how our national aspirations can coexist,” Lis said. “Those destructive acts, Baruch Goldstein’s massacre of Palestinians — he’s not a Zionist in my mind.”

“Lis said it is not racist for Jews to support a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. However, he noted the importance of compassion and understanding the historical ties between Jews in the 20th century and Palestinians today.”
If it’s not racist for Jews to support a Jewish homeland, or say, Japanese or Chinese to support a Japanese or Chinese homeland, or Arabs or Africans to support an Arab country or African country they consider their homeland, then why is it considered racist for Europeans or Whites to seek to persevere a European or White homeland?
