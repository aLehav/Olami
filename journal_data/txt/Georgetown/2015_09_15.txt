In northern Iraq, many war refugees are subject to torture, abuse and injury yet receive minimal resources or access to medical care. After he witnessed the dire need for aid on a service trip, Aaron Epstein (MED ’18) formed the Global Surgical and Medical Support Group, a coalition of medical students and professionals, which made its first trip to the region this summer to provide free medical services and education in a refugee camp.
During the few weeks that Epstein and his team were at the camp, they performed surgical operations for injured refugees and taught medical techniques to local doctors. In addition, the team provided psychiatric services for the refugees. Epstein could not provide specific details about the composition of the team and timing of the trip for security reasons.
Epstein said that he was first inspired to form GSMSG after he travelled to northern Iraq last fall, where he witnessed the gravity of the refugee crisis as populations fleeing the Islamic State group began to settle in Kurdish territories. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, there are 271,143 refugees residing in Iraq as of December 2014.
“[We saw] the need for the services that GSMSG could provide from seeing firsthand the obvious inadequacies in medical services available to populations that had fled [the Islamic State group],” Epstein wrote in an email to The Hoya. “There is an overwhelming medical burden in the Kurdish territories where most of the refugees have fled from the sectarian slaughter.”
When he returned, Epstein formed GSMSG, recruited surgeons and medical volunteers and raised funds for the group’s first trip.
Epstein contacted representatives from Iraqi organizations, such as Health Outreach to the Middle East, to push for Georgetown Medical School to support the initiative.
Regional Representative of HOME Janan Zora wrote a letter to GMS predating Epstein’s trip.
“While we have tried our best to accommodate the needs of the population, our medical system has become overwhelmed,” Zora wrote.
Regional Director of Jesuit Refugee Service Fr. Michael Zammit, S.J., also sent a letter to University President John J. DeGioia, citing the lack of basic resources in the region.
“Basic needs such as food, shelter, water and sanitation, [and] health care are what … refugees, are mostly in need of,” Zammit wrote in the letter, of which The Hoya received a copy. “As often happens, the gaps in all these areas can be significant. Gaps in health services are related to life and death. I can assure you that the contribution of GMS would fill a huge need, since the existing gaps are huge.”
The initiative gained traction, leading GMS to help promote the cause and recruit surgeons in senior positions to participate as volunteers.
Epstein assembled a group of individuals from diverse backgrounds to provide a broader range of skills to the local doctors.
“We had a range of medical skill sets all the way from board certified surgeons … to neuropsychiatrists to fire department medics, essentially offering a full range of medical, surgical and psychiatric services,” Epstein wrote.
According to Epstein, medical professionals in the area were eager to learn from his team.
“While one of our surgeons was performing a simple hernia repair, the operating room was absolutely packed with local medical professionals trying to see how the procedure was being done,” Epstein wrote.
However, Epstein said that the team provided help outside the medical scope, as it helped raise the morale and sense of security among refugees.
“I asked our local liaisons why there were literally dozens and dozens of people in line to be seen by our doctors even if they [had] nothing wrong with them. The reply was they know they have nothing wrong with them, but they just want to hear it from an American doctor,” Epstein wrote. “Peace of mind about their health goes a long way in a population that has lost literally everything and whose future is unclear.”
Deirdre Byrne, a retired U.S. Army colonel and doctor who went on the trip, said Epstein’s passion made a positive impact on the community.
“Aaron is the remarkable force behind this inspiring effort,” Byrne wrote in an email to The Hoya. “God works beautifully through him.”
Zora also praised GSMSG for its efforts to rebuild the country’s medical infrastructure and provide medical care and renewed hope.
“We believe [Epstein’s] unique background and the goodness and the charity of the people he interacts with will be able to help see our population through some of our hardest times,” Zora wrote in his letter to GMS.
Epstein said that the next step for GSMSG will be to establish mobile medical clinics to serve the thousands of refugees outside the camps who lack access to the main city and its medical surgical centers. Through these efforts, he hopes that the medical infrastructure in northern Iraq can become self-sufficient and eventually provide in-depth medical and surgical care to the burgeoning population of refugees in the area.
“If we can bring in the medical expertise, education and supplies necessary … the locals [will be] able to take care of their entire population,” Epstein wrote. “This is the marathon we are running and every step, every medical trip of experts and supplies, is movement in the right direction.”

The Armed Services Arts Partnership, a nonprofit that mounts arts programs for veterans and military families, will begin offering a free veterans’ writing seminar and comedy boot camp at Georgetown this September.
Specifically geared toward veterans at Georgetown, the programs will take the form of weekend-long workshops and will be taught by Ron Capps, a renowned veteran author, and Chris Coccia, lead instructor of Five Minutes to Funny at D.C. Improv.
According to ASAP Director of Operations Megan Brew, the programs benefit veterans and military families by facilitating the veterans’ artistic expression through comedy, writing and music.
“Our primary goal is to foster the development of our participating veterans’ expressive skills, allowing them to become better writers, musicians and comedians,” Brew wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In the process, veterans, service members and military families establish relationships with one another and begin to form supportive communities around these specific areas of common interest.”
After losing an uncle to suicide while in high school and learning of high suicide rates among veterans, Sam Pressler translated his experience into ASAP, using comedy as a coping mechanism, to launch a comedy class for veterans at the College of William and Mary.
After the class became successful, Pressler ventured into the areas of writing and music, transforming ASAP as a nonprofit and expanding his existing model into new communities with high military populations. ASAP was awarded the Echoing Green Global Fellowship in June as one of 50 global nonprofits “changing the world” in 2015.
Brew said that the positive impact of comedy, music and writing classes on veterans extends to veterans’ families and communities, observations that are rooted in scientific research.
“There is a growing body of academic research that links literary, musical and comedic expression to boosts in resilience and increases in well-being,” Brew wrote. “We are measuring the impact of our particular approach in facilitating these outcomes and also improving relationships with family, community members, classmates and employers.”
At Georgetown, the programs will be open for registration to veterans and military families. The nonprofit is collaborating with Veterans Office Director LeNaya Hezel and Special Programs and Group Initiatives Director Mary Dhuly to facilitate programming and coordinate logistics.
Additionally, ASAP is working closely with the Georgetown University Student Veterans Association to further engage nonveteran students, who will have the opportunity to sign up to be volunteers in the workshops.
Brew emphasized that expanding to Georgetown was a natural move due to the high population of servicemen in the District.
“With one of the largest military populations in the country, and huge existing demand for our classes from D.C. area veterans, establishing our second community in D.C. became a no-brainer,” Brew wrote.
Georgetown ranked as the No. 1 school for veterans in the country in the 2015 U.S. News & World Report. Despite dropping to No. 16 on the recently released ranking this year due to a change in the qualifications process, Brew notes that there is a strong tradition of volunteer involvement, particularly for veteran causes.
“The university was recently ranked the best school for veterans in the country,” Brew wrote. “Volunteer involvement is also hugely important to our work, and Georgetown’s reputation of having service-minded students and faculty made it an even more appealing partner.”
According to Zach Busch (SFS ’16), a student representative for ASAP at Georgetown, the nonprofit serves to better connect the Georgetown student body with the United States Armed Forces. Busch, who was drawn to the organization as he grew up around military families, also said that students can contribute to the program in a variety of ways.
“Hoyas are intelligent, enthusiastic and motivated people and have a lot to offer a program like ASAP,” Busch wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Apart from the efforts of a couple of very dedicated student groups, such as Hoyas for Troops, which does great work, and of course, the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, the Georgetown community as a whole is a little disconnected from our armed forces and our veterans.”
From an artistic perspective, Busch also emphasized that Georgetown fosters artistic talent that can be channeled into positive avenues in ASAP.
“When it comes to bridging a community gap between Georgetown students and our armed forces, art can do what ordinary conversation cannot — create a shared experience,” Busch wrote.
According to Shannon Smith, a U.S. Navy veteran, ASAP provided an opportunity for him to grow his writing skills. Smith also commended the participation of young people in ASAP’s programs.
“It’s amazingly thoughtful and kind that people out there — particularly young people — want to help veterans get our stories out there,” Smith wrote in a testimonial on ASAP’s website. “It’s not just valuable writing instruction — it’s tangible proof that people out there actually care. I was blown away by that.”
Jim Cornish, a U.S. Army veteran, noted how ASAP helped him to cope with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder.
“When my helicopter was shot down by enemy gunfire and my co-pilot was killed, it seems like just yesterday. I relive it just about everyday and suffer greatly with chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,” Cornish wrote on the ASAP website. “My music instructor knows that I am a war veteran and is very considerate in our progress.”
According to Busch, ASAP’s arrival at Georgetown provides an exciting opportunity for veterans and students alike.
“We can learn a lot from these veterans and put our own ambitions into perspective. So volunteering with a group like ASAP doesn’t just help veterans, it also helps Hoyas on a humanistic level,” Busch wrote.

Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton pledged to address sexual assault on college campuses during a “Women for Hillary” meeting at the University of Northern Iowa on Monday, making her the first 2016 contender to formally discuss the issue at a campaign event.
“As president, I’ll fight to make sure every campus offers every survivor the support she needs and will make sure those services are comprehensive, confidential and coordinated,” Clinton said at the event. “It is something deeply important to me to try to work together with everybody to bring about the changes that are necessary in behavior and attitude.”
Clinton’s plan, which remains nebulous, included three broad goals: to increase accessibility and transparency of support resources for survivors, to develop fairer treatment for both accusers and the accused and to improve preventative programming.
“Rape is a crime wherever it happens, and schools have an obligation — I think it’s both a legal obligation and a moral obligation — to protect every student’s right to get an education free from discrimination, free from fear, particularly as to one’s safety,” Clinton said.
Although Clinton did not provide concrete policy plans or methods of implementation, she recommended improving education in high schools to create a safer college culture.
“There are the issues of responsibility and respect that start long before students arrive on campus. I don’t think it’s enough to try and get a better response once an assault has happened,” Clinton said. “We need to stop sexual assault from happening in the first place, and we need strong prevention efforts to change attitudes associated with violence.”
Clinton’s speech came in the footsteps of President Barack Obama’s “It’s On Us” campaign. Launched in September 2014, the campaign aims to raise awareness of sexual assault on college campuses. Nearly one year after its launch, the campaign has thousands of members, including notable corporate partnerships with companies like MTV and Snapchat.
Take Back the Night President Maddy Moore (SFS ’17) said she is optimistic about other candidates creating platforms that look at sexual assault on college campuses as well.
“It’s really important that Hillary Clinton is bringing this topic up, and I think there’s a lot to how student activists have built momentum around the issue throughout the last years, so I think it will continue to be an issue that is brought up by the other candidates and hopefully candidates will create really strong platforms around the issue,” Moore said.
Amanda Shepherd (SFS ’18), campus lead for Hoyas for Hillary, a Georgetown student organization of Clinton supporters, also praised Clinton for bringing the issue of sexual assault into the presidential race.
“I am very happy to see Secretary Clinton take a stance on the important issue of campus sexual assault, but more importantly I am happy to see her propose ways to change the way in which college campuses support survivors,” Shepherd wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Hillary Clinton prioritizing this conversation and stating her dedication to aiding universities in addressing this debate brings it to the forefront of the political world and gives me hope that with her in the White House, survivors of sexual assault will receive the support they deserve on campuses and nationwide.”

Chris Murphy (GRD ’98) assumed the role of Georgetown’s first vice president for government relations and community engagement Aug. 10, filling a new position created within the Office of Federal Relations. Murphy’s past career experiences include working for President Barack Obama’s administration in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Atlantic Media Company and City Year. Most recently, Murphy served as chief of staff for former D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray (D). In an interview with The Hoya, Murphy spoke about his goals and the challenges he anticipated in this new position.
Why was this position created?
I think there was a growing realization in the university over the past couple of years that engaging with both the neighborhood and the city, and frankly, the national level, was of strategic importance to the university. So, although the functions existed, this was an opportunity to restructure how they were being managed and to elevate them to a higher level.
What does Georgetown gain from its involvement in the community?
Given Georgetown’s Jesuit tradition, as an institution, we all believe we share an obligation to interact with the real world and the people around us. We’re not an island here, and we have to take our responsibility in the broader community seriously. There’s a moral imperative there. I also think there’s strategic value in having good relationships with our neighbors.
We recently joined a coalition of our neighbors to question whether the Federal Aviation Administration has done the right research to justify flying these planes directly over campus. Because we have a good relationship with our neighbors, we make sure that quality of life issues like airplanes constantly going overhead are taken seriously. Those strategic partnerships help the university, faculty, students and staff.
Who are some of the institutions and groups you will be dealing with?
In the neighborhood, it’s going to be the Advisory Neighborhood Commission and various citizen associations. At the same time, we’re having really important conversations with the city and with community organizations that Georgetown partners with to hopefully leverage opportunities where students can engage in the real world in an academic setting, community service setting and a public service setting, as they think about what kind of careers they want to have. There are no limits to what kinds of partnerships we can have that benefit our partners and students.
One theme has emerged in a lot of conversations I’ve had with community groups. I think there is a sense that not enough people know about all the good work that’s going on. So I’ve started to have conversations with them about how we can better articulate and better tell the story about how Georgetown is already engaging in the community. I think the more we do that, the more it will open up opportunities to do it even more, and even more effectively. The Center for Social Justice is a critical partner of ours, and that’s just one example of how we can tell this story better.
What has your relationship been like with Georgetown University Student Association? [Editor’s Note: GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Vice-President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) co-wrote an op-ed in The Hoya (“Engaging the Wrong Community,” thehoya.com, July 20, 2015) that was skeptical of Murphy’s new position.]
I’ve met with GUSA leadership several times, and we have a terrific working relationship. I think first and foremost it’s important to think about the strategic role that these functions play. If we as a university do not have a good relationship with our neighbors, that hurts everybody, including students. By recognizing the importance of these functions, I think everybody wins.
If you asked GUSA leadership now, I don’t get the sense that there would be any concerns. What we’re also able to do is make sure the student voice is at the table when we do have conversations with neighbors. I do know that there is a sense that voice hasn’t been there enough, and the position that I am in now uniquely positions me to help be a bridge between those two voices.
What do you see as the biggest challenge or obstacle facing you in this position?
We’ve come a long way. The university has come a long way in terms of developing mechanisms through the Georgetown Community Partnership to talk to each other respectfully and to understand the unique perspectives we all bring to the table. We’re in a very good place, but that’s not something we can take for granted. We always have to keep working at it and make sure that we’re really listening to each other and recognizing the unique perspectives that everybody has. I’m glad we have great mechanisms now, through the Georgetown Community Partnership, through monthly meetings through GUSA and through constant communication through neighbors.
How have your past experiences helped prepare you for this?
What I love about this job is that it brings together pieces of every job I’ve ever had. I’ve worked on Capitol Hill and for the federal government; I’ve worked for the city government; I’ve worked for a local nonprofit, and I’m a Georgetown alum. The position I’m in now really brings all those skills together to help advance the strategic goals of the university. Specific skillsets around how those specific institutions work but also relationships are critically important to getting things done.

Former Director of Catholic Chaplaincy Fr. Patrick Rogers, S.J., has returned to Georgetown after completing a yearlong Tertianship, the final program in Jesuit training.
Although Rogers is back on campus to work on his doctoral thesis, he will conduct masses and confession at Georgetown. In his previous nine years at Georgetown, Rogers expanded the ESCAPE program, fostered interfaith dialogue and founded the LGBTQ Catholic Prayer Group, which predated the establishment of the LGBTQ Resource Center.
The Hoya spoke with Rogers last week to discuss his experiences in the Tertianship, his involvement in interfaith and LGBTQ issues and what brought him back to Georgetown.
What kept you at Georgetown for nine years?
There’s a combination of things. I started a doctorate while I was here. You’re called to Tertianship. I was here for a number of years, and my provincial and I were talking about it, and basically preparing for it when I started this doctoral program. So we thought it was best that I finish my classwork and my conference exams, all that stuff first, and then go off to Tertianship.
What was your biggest challenge during your Tertianship?
Every tertian at one point in Tertianship has to do an experiment with the poor, the dying or the sick. So I was sent to Honduras, and I was working at a Jesuit parish there part-time and also teaching music to a Jesuit theater troupe. But I had some very challenging experiences with the parish because there were some remote villages up in the mountains near where we used to have to go, and it was very difficult to get there; very steep mountains, jungles, literally walking through jungle paths, and frankly, I was terrified constantly of the poisonous snakes that are up there.
What inspired you to become involved in Georgetown’s ESCAPE program? When you first started the ESCAPE program, what were your goals?
When I first got involved in ESCAPE, it was literally because I was asked to think about coming to Georgetown specifically to work with the ESCAPE program as a Jesuit.  What has really evolved, at least from the time that I took over, is how the directors after me really trained the team on how to be sensitive to people’s issues that are coming on ESCAPE, and how to integrate an Ignatian sensibility in one’s life. This idea that [people are] seeking the magis, always looking for the good in one’s self. The thousands of people that this program has really welcomed to the Hilltop is astounding.
I know that you have participated in a number of interfaith programs. How do you see students of other faiths fitting in at a Catholic university? And I wonder if you have any words about Rabbi Harold White, who passed away last week.
Absolutely. I knew Rabbi White very, very well. We worked together for years, and we even traveled together to the Holy Land. He’s one of the great figures in the history of this university. … He helped this university open itself to new possibilities and deeper possibilities with the Jewish community. … There were many students of other faith traditions that sought out Rabbi White for pastoral care, just because they loved him and could go to him for spiritual guidance, regardless of faith traditions.
What’s extraordinary about this university is that it’s in the Jesuit tradition. Our way of proceeding is to, again, ask deep questions of anybody you’re with. So for example, St. Ignatius, in his day, could ask the person who had no idea of what God even was, or the greatest mystic alive at that time, “Tell me about your experience of the good of grace in your life, or light in your life, or however you want to name goodness in your life. Let’s start a conversation there, and then we can go from there.” So because it’s based on your experience, the student’s experience, it’s open to anyone.
You started an LGBTQ prayer group. Do you believe that the Church under Pope Francis is becoming more tolerant of different sexual orientations? And how have you counseled these students to remain true to their faith even when traditional church doctrine is not supportive?
Doctrine about sexuality hasn’t changed at all in the Catholic Church. So Pope Francis hasn’t changed anything doctrinally about homosexuality in the church. What has changed, I think greatly, is rhetoric about it. … It’s like Pope Francis has given us permission to have a conversation that’s not in the closet, so to speak. And again, Pope Francis is a Jesuit, so this is a very Jesuit way of proceeding. So he’s asking gay and lesbian people and all kinds of people, the poor, whoever it might be, “What is your experience? I’m not going to discount you because your experience is not one that I recognize. I’m going to ask about your experience and engage you from there.”
What is your favorite thing about Georgetown?  
My favorite thing about Georgetown is how this again extraordinary university brings such diversity together, and all the fascinating things that happen because of that. Muslim voices, Jewish voices, secular voices, Hindu voices, whatever faith traditions, Protestant, Catholic, all coming together in dialogue with each other, and that’s just the spirituality side. Of course at the university we’re exploring all kinds of amazing ideas, and scholarship, and research. And so that’s what is so extraordinary about Georgetown, all the great things that happen here everyday in this human story. But we’re all Hoyas, and we’re all looking for meaning in our lives. Georgetown helps us find and discover meaning in our lives.

Director of the Mortara Center for International Studies Kathleen McNamara discussed political authority in the European Union at the launch event for her new book, “The Politics of Everyday Europe: Constructing Authority in the European Union,” Wednesday in the Mortara Center.
At the event, McNamara discussed the main topics of her book, which focuses on the importance of culture, symbols and practices to the unity created by the leaders of the European Union.
Associate Professor at the School of Foreign Service Abraham Newman introduced McNamara at the beginning of the event and praised the book’s analysis of the European political climate.
“’The Politics of Everyday Europe’ … takes a central question to political science, the question of political authority, and investigates it from a novel perspective,” Newman said. “She looks at the everyday symbols and practices that elites use in order to construct that political authority.”
McNamara, who began work on the book six years ago, led the discussion on common ideas regarding the European Union and how she sought to redefine these notions.
“Many people think about the European Union as this sort of technical morass of mind-numbing regulations,” McNamara said. “My argument is that we should also think about the E.U. as a new emergent political form. We should really step back and think historically about what the E.U. represents in this broader geopolitical, historical sense.”
In the book, McNamara argues that the European Union deserves special attention in the field of comparative politics, as it presents a new form of political organization that will continue in years to come.
McNamara said that although the Union centralized power and has brought together a large number of states under one political entity, it has not encountered a large degree of opposition.
“There has been a remarkable centralization of policy capacity within the E.U.,” McNamara said. “Over the past decades we’ve actually seen remarkably little mass politics and contestation around that centralization until … the last five or six years.”
McNamara said that the acceptance of the E.U. and its success in constructing political authority has come through symbols and practices, which have allowed it to become accepted as a legitimate entity by its constituent member states.
According to McNamara, the E.U. has used symbols and practices in a way that has allowed national culture and identity to continue to thrive, while also creating a European identity that it has legitimatized through a new form of political organization.
“It’s really this everyday Europe that we should look to, to understand the symbols and practices creating Europe and Europeans,” McNamara said. “It doesn’t engage passionate feelings of belonging and identity, because the E.U. has always tried to pitch these symbols and practices as complementary to and not competing with the nation-state.”
McNamara said that culture is an important tool that can be used by politicians.
“Culture can be a tool for power,” McNamara said. “It can actually be a really important mechanism for interested parties to create a sense of certainty about their political authority.”
McNamara also discussed the formation of political authority in Europe.
“Political authorities try to redraw the boundaries of political authority and … try to rewrite history in order to promulgate certain understandings of their political projects and to create a sense of identity,” McNamara said.
McNamara concluded by emphasizing how the E.U. in particular has benefited through the use of these tools and has been able to create a continental European culture.
“The E.U. has been very conscious of this type of historical work and has in fact spent a lot of time and money trying to think about how to create Europeans,” McNamara said.
Miika Tomi (SFS ’17), who attended the event, said she found McNamara’s argument about everyday life in Europe fascinating.
“I think the issue of Europe is ever more pressing, and Professor McNamara had interesting thoughts on how to look at constructing identities,” Tomi said. “Having worked for the E.U. government for the past four years, I thought it was a very interesting perspective.”

Elect Her, a national program that prepares college-aged women to run for student government and political office, held its second annual program at Georgetown in the Healey Family Student Center Saturday.
The three-hour event, hosted by the American Association of University Women and Running Start, featured a series of lectures and an address from Washington, D.C. City Councilwoman Anita Bonds. Other sponsors of the session at Georgetown included the Georgetown University Women’s Center, the Biondi Copeland Family Fund, the Institute of Politics and Public Service, the McCourt School of Public Policy and the Women Policy Makers House.
Approximately 50 participants learned about planning campaign strategies and giving elevator pitches, and also participated in a campaign simulation. A panel of current Georgetown students, such as Georgetown University Student Association Chief of Staff Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16) and Secretary of Sexual Assault Policy Sarah Rabon (COL ’16), also explained how students can become involved in GUSA.
In her speech, Bonds encouraged attendees to become involved in politics.
“We would love to have a woman lead our nation,” Bonds said.
Running Start Vice President Melissa Richmond led the majority of the presentations, kicking off the event with an address titled “The Importance of Young Women Running for Office.”
According to Richmond, Running Start was formed in 2007 to support young women who are considering careers in politics.
“Young women and girls need to be educated about politics earlier in life if the makeup of the political leaders in our country is to transform,” Richmond said.
Despite comprising a majority of the electorate, women account for only 24 percent of state legislators, 23 percent of statewide executives and 19 percent of Congress.
At colleges in D.C., women account for 39 percent of student government executives.
“I don’t think there are enough women in the pipeline,” Richmond said. “Unless women start running young, they’re behind. Men start running young and often. … They get a lot of experience.”
Elect Her is held on college campuses around the country, with sessions planned at around 50 schools for 2016. According to its website, 76 percent of 2015 participants who reported running for student office won their races.
Other speeches in the program cited a number of barriers to women running for office, including feelings of inferiority, media scrutiny and concerns about family and home life.
Despite the event’s overall focus on politics, Richmond stressed that the skills taught at Elect Her can be applied to a wide range of fields.
“Even if you don’t run for office, the skills of building a network or giving an elevator speech could help you to start a business, be a nonprofit leader or be a good servant in your community,” Richmond said.
Participants of Elect Her also automatically join the AAUW’s network of 170,000 members and supporters, 1,000 local branches and 800 college partners, including Yale University, Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.
Kelli Baker (COL ’19), an attendee of the event, said that she was drawn to Elect Her after encountering criticism during a campaign for student government in high school.
“They would say, ‘There’s no way she can win, she’s a girl,’” Baker said. “It’s 2015 — are [they] crazy? It made me very angry.”

A group of Washington, D.C. Metro users formed the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Riders’ Union Sept. 3 in response to consistent transit issues and rider frustration.
The Riders’ Union, an independent organization made up of approximately 400 riders, seeks to represent the interests of Metrorail, Metrobus and MetroAccess users. The union intends to work with community groups, the media, officials and WMATA employees to address the concerns of the riding public.
Riders’ Union spokesperson Graham Jenkins emphasized the group’s goal in actively listening to and representing the voice of Metro riders.
“We represent the voice of the riders, the feedback, criticism and changes people would like to be seeing in the Transit Authority,” Jenkins said. “Somebody should be taking those concerns into account. We’re trying to be truly representative and nonexclusionary, to hear everyone’s voice, not just a limited subset, and not just the loudest either.”
Chris Barnes, another Metro user leading the group, began operating a blog titled FixWMATA in 2010 with goals similar to those of the Riders’ Union. Business analyst Roger Bowles and transit specialist Ashley Robbins are the two other principal figures in the group.
According to the Riders’ Union website, WMATA has struggled to respond to train derailments and excessive delays while often neglecting users’ points of view. Additionally, the website details frustrations with WMATA’s system of charging users for a commute they did not take if they swipe in at a station but attempt to leave after seeing the rail service is running late.
Specifically, the union has outlined both strategic and operational goals it aims to achieve after establishing its membership.
Strategic goals include obtaining rider representation on the WMATA board of directors and rider involvement in WMATA drills and incident investigations. However, the District, Maryland, Virginia and Congress would all have to pass a law before any rider could acquire a seat on the board of directors.
Operational goals include seeking the elimination of “peak” fares between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. and a grace period for same-station entrance and exit before users are charged.
“For the time being, [our goals] fit into two categories,” Jenkins said. “We’re looking to push the [Transit] Authority into communicating better. You look at the [Transit] Authorities across the country, in New York, in Boston, and they’re very active in publicizing all the work they do.”
More than 400 people have completed the membership form on the Riders’ Union website, and the group’s Twitter account has more than 1,100 followers. No dues will be required to maintain accessibility. An agreement form will be created for members to consent to certain principles regarding dues and donation.
The Riders’ Union does not yet have a definite plan for funding but is considering a combination of private donations and crowdsourcing strategies, such as GoFundMe. The group also plans to host monthly meetings.
Along with Barnes’ FixWMATA blog, past campaigns have been initiated in response to challenges Metro users face. MetroTag, a group also formed by Barnes, focuses on issues concerning all D.C. transit, covering a larger scope than the Riders’ Union, which will only focus on WMATA matters.
Meanwhile, the WMATA Riders’ Advisory Council, established in 2005, consists of 21 members and reports directly to the WMATA board of directors, acting as a focus group. It is not independent of WMATA.
Monthly council meetings are open to the public and applications to serve on the council are always available online. At the start of every session, members of the public are given the opportunity to address the council.
Although the official WMATA council provides riders with the opportunity to air their grievances, Jenkins said the Riders’ Union is a more effective forum for change.
“We’re looking to raise awareness of some of [the riders’] concerns, and certainly to push for specific policy goals and changes we’d like to see implemented,” Jenkins said. “In that aspect, we’ll be different from previous attempts at this sort of thing, such as the Riders’ Advisory Council, in that we’re not just presenting WMATA with issues, we are recommending changes and we’re going for specific policy goals.”
Steven Xie (COL ’18), who has frequently used D.C. public transportation to commute to an internship at the Executive Office of the Mayor in D.C., expressed both hope and doubt about the success of the Riders’ Union.
“First of all, I’m not too sure they’ll get everything they desire, because things like delays and accidents, they happen all the time,” Xie said. “But what I do think they can really do is bring some accountability into Metro services, which is the biggest complaint I’ve had riding the Metro. … I think it’s a good initiative, the Union, and hopefully it can bring some positive change to the staff of the Metro system.”
Lauren Stricker (SFS ’18), another frequent Metro user, was also even less optimistic about the Union’s feasibility.
“I don’t think forming a union is worth all of the time, effort and resources when its central goal of communicating the needs and wants of riders could be achieved in a less formal and more immediate way,” Stricker said.

Mayor Muriel Bowser and Metropolitan Police Department Chief Cathy Lanier displayed more than 60 illegal guns recently seized by the MPD at a press conference Sept. 8 to highlight the Bowser administration’s commitment to reducing the number of illegal guns bought and sold in the city.
The women discussed the MPD’s GunStat program, which was developed in 2008 to monitor citizens in Washington, D.C. with violent criminal records. The program aims to closely observe these people, ensuring they remain in direct contact with law enforcement and parole agencies. This program is intended to decrease the District’s homicide rate, which currently, at 109, is already higher than 2014’s total of 105 murders.
During the press conference, both Lanier and Bowser stressed the importance of addressing the root causes of the illegal firearms issue, rather than looking at one particular part of the system.
“Instead of seeing where else there’s blame, we’re looking to see where there are gaps in the system,” Lanier said at the conference.
Bowser agreed and evaded reporters’ questions that asked her to assign blame.
“It does no one any good to point fingers,” Bowser added.
Additionally, Bowser and Lanier announced increased rewards for tips leading to the seizure of illegal firearms in August. While the MPD previously offered $1,000 for all tips about illegal guns, changes increased the reward to $2,500 for information leading to an arrest and seizure of an illegal firearm and $10,000 for a tip resulting in an arrest and conviction in a shooting. Anonymous tips can also be submitted.
Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber said the program is a positive step toward reducing violence in the D.C. area.
“Any program such as GunStat that reduces gun violence is a good thing and a step in the right direction,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The impact to the Georgetown community is an overall safer Washington, D.C.”
Georgetown Against Gun Violence President Emma Iannini (SFS ’16) praised Bowser’s efforts and highlighted the need to look at firearms regulations not only in D.C., but in other states as well.
“I applaud the work of Mayor Bowser and local law enforcement for trying to get as many illegal guns and dangerous military-style weapons out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them,” Iannini said. “However, I think they have a very difficult problem on their hands, a problem whose roots are outside of their ability to control.”
Current District policy includes universal background checks and restrictions on military-style weapons. However, people can still purchase these guns in neighboring states, such as Virginia and Maryland, without these background checks.
“It’s important to realize that the homicide rate and amounts of illegal guns that are being trafficked and eventually confiscated by the police here in Washington is really an issue that originates outside of D.C.,” Iannini said. “As citizens of Washington, we need to put pressure on elected officials in places like Maryland and places like Virginia to acknowledge the responsibility for the violence.”
Some of the most notable opposition to Bowser and Lanier’s tighter gun control has come from the
American Civil Liberties Union in D.C. The group has raised concerns that the GunStat Program violates the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment, which prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures.”
According to former ACLU director Johnny Barnes, the ACLU may file a lawsuit against the city for this violation. Barnes also expressed dissatisfaction over GunStat’s close monitoring of people with violent criminal records.
“They’ve paid their debt to society,” Barnes said to the D.C. bureau of ABC News. “They’ve served their time. Now you want to say, ‘Let’s watch them every day.’ That’s wrong.”

The Georgetown Office of Sustainability, Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation and Georgetown University Student Association held a daylong Sustainability Visioning Workshop Friday to discuss university-wide sustainability goals.
With approximately 20 students and multiple administrators in attendance, the workshop solicited student input about the university’s environmental efforts. Students were placed into groups charged with proposing solutions to issues related to waste, carbon and water, which will directly guide the university’s sustainability plan later this year.
Some of the changes that students suggested include implementing an energy retrofit process for existing buildings, reimagining the annual move-out drive and creating an umbrella structure to increase the exchange of sustainability ideas between students, faculty and other partners.
Office of the President Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara introduced the event with a quote from Pope Francis’ environmental encyclical. Ferrara linked the workshop to the Pope’s concept of a “circular economy,” which encourages reusing and recycling materials rather than producing nonsustainable products.
“He stresses the importance of having the right attitude versus talking the talk but not really walking the walk,” Ferrera said. “Sometimes people can have all the correct attitudes … and that sounds good, but what are you actually doing?”
Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Christopher Augostini followed Ferrara, presenting the origins of the workshop and encouraging participants to adopt ambitious goals.
“The origins of creating this laboratory came from a meeting that Audrey [Stewart, Office of Sustainability director], Robin [Morey, vice president for planning and facilities management] and I had with a few of you on Earth Day earlier this year,” Augostini said.
Augostini also stated that although the university would likely continue its sustainable investments — like its partial divestment from coal last year — he hopes that the workshop will “broaden the conversation.”
Additionally, Augostini hopes that the university will become “carbon positive” by detracting from the amount of overall carbon dioxide emissions produced each year.
“Let’s be carbon-positive, however long that takes us,” Augostini said. “I think the objective ought to be the principle, not the time frame. We want to place that out there as something for this group to think about.”
Beeck Center Director of Engagement Liz Anderson explained that the goal of the workshop was to tackle issues related to the treatment of waste, energy and water on campus.
“We had students refine those goals and create actionable plans in terms of how they would then meet those goals,” Anderson said.
Steward said she was impressed by the quality and ambition of student feedback at the workshop.
“We got great feedback from students on both big-picture goals for our campus footprint and operations, and also specific project ideas,” Steward wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In general, the feedback was in support of thinking very ambitiously about the topics and really challenging ourselves as a university to set an ambitious vision.”
Steward also emphasized that university officials would take student opinion into account in their sustainability planning.
“Our goal is to support the student leaders who developed the ideas, and to work collaboratively with students and other partners in refining and testing the solutions on campus over the coming year,” Steward wrote.
The workshop used a process called the Smallify Rapid Innovation Lab, an idea development model intended to facilitate expedited brainstorming and problem solving. Initially, the workshop focused on design thinking, then transitioned into narrowing down ideas during the afternoon.
Deputy GUSA Secretary for Sustainability Aaron Silberman (SFS ’18) credited Smallify for leading the workshop.
“What we’ve been doing is engaging in a multiplicity of conversations thanks to Smallify, who is the organizer and lead facilitator of this meeting, regarding energy, waste and water,” Silberman said. “And so far, we’ve managed to get down a ton of good ideas. Everybody is coming from different perspectives, so we’ve all got specific expertise.”
Elena Itameri (COL ’18) was a member of the carbon innovation group, which was tasked with the problem of making the university carbon-positive by 2025.
“We essentially started out in pairs, and we brainstormed what we thought were the most efficient actions we could take to get the university to that point, and then we regrouped,” Itameri said. “We found similarities between our ideas, and we started trying to come up with a larger solution or action to take based on all the ideas we compiled.”
Itameri said that she was impressed with the outcome of the workshop.
“I think it’s relevant because most people who are in attendance today either have a specific interest in sustainability or are actively involved in a campus organization. … I thought it went really well,” Itameri said.
Silberman said he expects the university to take action on many of the student proposals from the workshop.
“The plans are going to go directly into the sustainability plan for the university, so the university is developing a framework and this is going to inform the direction of the plan, and then the specific actions,” Silberman said.
